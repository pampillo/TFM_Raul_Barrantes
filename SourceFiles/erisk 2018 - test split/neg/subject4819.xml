<TITLE> What's the line between a movie having a gimmicky feature like out of order scenes and one that is clever adding rewatch value? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 05:15:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For example, what determines how a movie uses the way it's being watched by the audience to cleverly present a story or show it in an interesting way? We have the movie pulp fiction which has different sequences presented out of order. It's a great movie that really had a significant impact on its genre of cinema as a whole.

Another amazing movie is Memento, which similarly uses out of order scenes and distinguishing between scenes using black and white. Both are amazing, critically acclaimed movies. 

Then there are other movies like say... the difficult to watch Irreversible that is basically the movie being told backwards. Or movies that use black and white to seem artsy without understanding if it works stylistically for them like Ed Wood, which actually pulls it off. However I didn't feel like there was a point to Frances Ha being b+w, seeing the scenes they shot in color actually add a whole lot to the movie.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why do people have a problem with the goody 2 shoes character? I've always liked that character, and feel like I can rely on them. But when I see the idiot character, the one that audiences love, I dislike them and want to stay as far away from them as possible, even if the hijinx done are all in the name of comedy. 

My favorite character has always been Lisa because she's smart, or Leela because she's dependable, and as a kid those were the characters I gravitated towards. 

Just legitimately curious over the psychology behind liking a certain character more than another.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I still don't understand why they left. I know there was talk about a spinoff that focused on Bobby and Hunter on the run, but I'm surprised that was serious talk considering it doesn't sound profitable to make a new series about these 2 in a show that is already teetering on the edge of cancellation. 

Now that their pilot didn't take off, does that mean they'll come back, or does the studio not want them back? Is there only room for one veteran badass female agent a la May? I really liked Bobby and thought she was going to be a mainstay, especially if Mockingbird is this important character in the comics of agents of shield.  </TEXT>

Though do agree about the necessary hobo impression in the first couple of episodes.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Maybe it will help boost sales, maybe we'll get a special edition green Vita, it's just a shame to see the handheld die. It's such a nifty piece of hardware but there's just no games on it. It was nice enough for Falcom to release Ys 8 on both it and ps4, but really it doesn't compare to actually having games on it from different developers and different genres.

Because MGS Peace Walker on PSP did a lot for the handheld. Hell I don't even like MGS and I bought my first PSP because of that bundle.

So I think an original MGS would do wonders for Vita, even if like PW it will just get ported to ps4 later down the line.

Hell I just realized the real problem; not even square enix is giving vita the time of day. While the 3ds got a kingdom hearts, the vita which has analog sticks now didn't get one at all, and a kh 2.94323 and three quarters would have really helped the system.

Plus it would be interesting to see a game really take advantage of whatever the hardware has to offer. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The "art" of binging means that people can now watch almost an entire half season's worth of episodes in one day. Whether or not that's better than pacing yourself and watching one episode or 2 a day, who's to say. 

But netflix and binging type streaming services has already marked the death of "clipshow" episodes that are now no longer necessary when you can watch an entire series at once, and no longer miss an episode on tv. 

How about soap operas, which are usually a daily thing that older people watch at a certain time as part of their daily routine, will that be affected by binging? 

What do you think binging episodes will mean for the future of tv shows? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just for the record, wire-fu isn't inherently bad. I love wuxia movies and stuff like House of Flying Daggers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Hero, etc.

Just wondering if wire-fu is part of the character of the iron fist, since I don't know what his comic self is like, if it's all about chinese homages like how luke cage is about blaxploitation homages.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope they're up to it (in more ways than one)

Still, it's just... Daredevil 2 showed it's hard to take people in black red garb with knives and swords seriously in the 21st century where people have guns and automatic weapons. It's just more goofy than anything else, and reminds me of that one It's Always Sunny episode with Mac trying to come at Charlie with a sword when Charlie is holding a gun just shooting at him. 

At least with magic it makes sense that only magic can beat other magic, but all the martial arts in the world isn't gonna make you faster than  bullets spraying in all directions from a machine gun or whatever.  </TEXT>

Not the greatest of signs. I'd attribute stuff like that to why Iron is supposedly liked the least out of the Marvel shows, but here's hoping. Fist is the character I know the least about in comics, like not even a little bit of passing knowledge like Luke Cage. So still holding off on judging the overall show until the end.

<TEXT> Was it an orthodox title for a show? Maybe. Does it have a very specific kind of humor? Perhaps. But nearly every scene of every episode had moments that made me burst out laughing. 

I was going to post a link to a scene to showcase what the grinder is like but one scene doesn't really do it justice. It's one of those shows that you'll know if you'll like it immediately from the very first episode. 

It's quirky, meta at times, self-referential and just feels really original. Shame it couldn't have been Fox's 3rd great comedy show along with B99 .

Just... I can't stop being ticked that it was canceled and suffered in the ratings apparently. At least we the first season was a full 22 episodes so we'll always have those... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately it's very true. Sure nowadays there is an actual "no cigarettes will be sold to under 21" law (not unlike alcohol in the western world) but the fact of the matter is not many stores care to enact this law and even then, smoking still occurs regardless of purchasing a cig, they'll get it any other way. 

It's... frustrating to say the least, living in a society that's all about control but when it matters regarding health a la smoking, is completely ambivalent.  </TEXT>

It's just that with the foul smell and the cancer causing and addictive qualities of nicotine, you'd think they would have done so... I don't know.

<TITLE> Some questions about the show and the finale (Major Spoilers for entire series) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Such a Great show. Very intense. It gives me so many questions and makes me hunger for more episodes. 

I wonder why at the same time that Dolores is able to kill and achieve consciousness, Maeve decides to go back instead of leaving Westworld? 

Also that scene reminded me of Ex Machina a little, and like that movie I wonder how these androids even work. What sustains them. If they go out in the world how will they survive, what exactly is their power source. Is the blood for show, clearly not if putting blood from Lawrence into Teddy made Teddy more alive somehow (I guess they all have the same blood type or something). Do they have any form of biology like eating and stuff? I dunno. How exactly do you want to have sex with something that... I mean synthetic flesh isn't really enough, what about I dunno taste and smell and all these other qualities that make up real people.

How can Ford just get away with killing Theresa? And Elsie's disappearance after vacation time is up? What happened to the head of security guy who was with Elsie and seemed to suspect Bernard? I don't think they've shown him since. 

So did Logan just die in Westworld, is that what was implied? William made him dehydrate and/or starve on the outskirts of the park?

At the end the credits rolled but then we got a mid credits scene with the blond snake lady. Why didn't the security guards shoot the hell out of the blonde snake lady, why the hell are they just standing there saying "get on the ground" instead of shooting her with the bullets and guns they have? I can't even... I don't even... What? Why are they just standing there instead of blasting her with bullets?

Such a great show, I'm glad I watched it, and I hope there's more to come.

<TEXT> In the season 1 episode 11 "Up All Night" Mitch forces Cam to "ferberize" the baby Lily by making her cry herself to sleep, something that to us seems downright barbaric and I can't even. 

On the flip side, in the season 2 episode "someone  to watch over Lily" they freak out over Lily having gotten her ears pierced, something that is considered a rite of passage for all baby girls here, something about it being better to have the ears pierced when they're young.  

I just find it funny how people from different cultures interpret what is right and wrong compared to what the characters find right and wrong. Leaving a baby to cry themselves to sleep is a big no-no, yet Mitchell talks about it like a completely normal thing. Just always find that weirder and weirder on rewatches.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> FF 12 being released on the ps4 is getting me really excited since I'd like to try the job system that was in the japanese and PAL versions of the game. 

But I wonder if they're going to have the option to switch the camera x axis this time around because in the original FF 12 the camera was permanently on reverse, so if you moved the analog stick right it would go left, and vice versa. Was rather annoying that they couldn't be bothered to let players have the option to switch to the kind of camera they prefer. 

It's not a big deal but really it's the little things that make up life and the same can be said for enjoyment of games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm dreading the thumbs down arrows this post will get but I also was rather ambivalent about the movie. I can appreciate the concept of obsession and I like that revenge twist JK does to the kid, but the entire movie just sounds like a loud cacaphony of sounds that is aggravating to my ear. As someone who doesn't really care for music I really have less of a stake and appreciation for the guy bleeding his hands out to make loud noises. Aka music really is subjective. 

But I still like the idea behind what they were going for, one guy pushing because he wants the absolute best out of someone and another always coming back for more. It's just priorities wise I can't seem to care for something as insignificant to me as music. I'm so strongly reminded of the Brooklyn 99 episode where they bring philharmonic musical instrument players and show how they're all starving and scrapping for food due to dying interest in the arts by the public. Couldn't help thinking of that episode every time someone in the movie was taking music too seriously.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Similarities between Spirited Away and Coraline? *Spoilers* </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-09 06:58:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This may be an obvious observation or maybe I'm over thinking it but after watching the movie Coraline  I couldn't help but notice quite a few similarities to Spirited Away in the main characters.
Again, bear with me as these may be blatant/obvious but here's a couple things that stood out to me in both films:
Both start out with young pre-teen girls moving or having just moved to a new location
Said girls are loathe to move because they are leaving behind friends
Both have parents that are either un-attentive or outright dismissive
Both go through a tunnel that leads to a different world of sorts
Both meet a boy that either helps or guides them in their journey at different points
Both have to rescue their parents from a malevolent mother type figure through a test or game
I thought there were some interesting contrast as well: Coraline is initially sold on this other world pretty quickly but increasingly comes to find it a terrible place while Chihiro is scared of being there and increasingly comes to find it comforting.
I'm sure there are probably more things that I missed but those seemed like the more obvious ones. Given how revered Spirited Away is, I wonder if there was an influence between these or it it's purely coincidental. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She didn't seem unhappy at all during her time there. She had a job, was enjoying her relationship with Jim Farrel, hanging out with her friend... I mean I personally would be someone who would go to America rather than stay in the place where they grew up, but that is my own bias. It didn't seem like she yearned for America because she kept hiding/putting away her husband's letters from america and feeling guilty about it, and didn't know what to write back to him if she did read the letters. 

I can understand the security and feeling of comfort in marrying a well off man like Jim in a town she grew up in... I dunno, just it seemed like the old lady snooping was the only trigger that made her leave. Nothing beforehand had made her unhappy, which made me wonder whether it was just being reminded she was in a gossipy town that made her leave. 

I was hoping they'd show how how being do different now, especially with how glamorous her clothing and 1950s sunglasses were, causing states by the drab dressed villagers everywhere she walked by  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I absolutely love saoirse ronan and if you haven't seen the movie I implore you to watch it. 

The acting is superb, and the dialogue very endearing, being from the same guy who screenplayed 2009's an education (also a good movie to watch)

The colors and sets of 1950s america and beautiful and wonderfully contrasted with the more homely simple look of this Irish town. 

One thing I'm bothered by is that I wish the movie hadn't made the decision for saoirse's character to leave Ireland and go back to America because that spiteful old lady found out she was married and was seemingly intending to blackmail her and/or just be a huge nosy nelly gossip. 

If that WASN'T in the movie... what would she have done? Would she have chosen to stay in Ireland and marry Jim or go back to America to thw nice Italian boy she'd already married? It's not an easy decision. And it feels like she didn't make a choice, but rather just had her hand tied and fate decided. 

I dunno.  It's a story that really hit close to home, which is partly why I love it so much. Just really fantastic all around.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember back in the beginning of Modern Family reading up on how Luke's actor in real life is actually some super genius with a high school and/or college degree when he was just 13 or something. I assumed eventually that he'd do something else. It's kinda clear that they really don't know what to do with him and his story lines once he'd grown up into a full-fledged man and is no longer the cute little kid doing antics with his young-at-heart father (and yes they also did an episode on that)

It actually seems like they don't know what to do with most of the young unmarried males in the family. 

As for Alex, I always assumed that they'd have to feature her less eventually since she's the super genius in the show and would go to a college with intensive classes and she'd be studying very hard to earn her degree in a STEM field. I personally don't know what more they can do with her. I agree with another user who stated how annoyed he was that they just had her yelling and irritable in every episode she's been in recently. It's kinda hard not to notice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Season 2 Someone to watch over Lily. I assumed it was because they wanted to be there when Lily's ears first got pierced or something, but throughout the episode they never once explained it. Feels like one of those values dissonance things where people from other cultures like myself don't understand why Mitch and Cam got so upset at Lily's ears being pierced (that's how it's usually done here, where mothers/aunts/etc pierce the baby daughter's ears at a young age with those tiny earrings Gloria had on Lily) 


Btw rewatching this show and I love Phil, while I love him the whole Phil crush on Gloria in the beginning has not aged well at all... I mean when you're married to someone like Julie Bowen, it just does not make sense. At least not to me. Otherwise great show to rewatch, laughing so hard at some of the classic jokes and others I'd forgotten.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh wow so many posts! I was going to type up my entire thoughts on the show since I started rewatching it at the beginning of the month. 

Watching the 5 episode pilot was so bittersweet with the amount of nostalgia and childhood memories. I owned SO many gargoyles action figures and toys. I remember being shocked when I first came on the internet and found out that it wasn't as massively popular and well known as it should have been, considering it's such a great series. Hearing Goliath's voice still gives me goosebumps every time. 

I started watching out of nostalgic reasons but now I legitimately think this show is great and fantastic with complex characters and story lines. 

I feel so bad for Macbeth for all that he's been through. I want to hate Demona, but then I'll be just like her, filled with nothing but hate, and continuing the endless cycle of vengeance and suffering. So I just pity her. Pity her for never being able to love again. The 4 parter city of stone that shows Demona's backstory and how she and Macbeth came to know each other is great, and I love how that theme of vengeance begetting vengeance is ever present.

I did feel slightly betrayed when the weird sisters turned out to be not really that altruistic and were just manipulating Macbeth and Demona for *centuries*, all culminating in them getting the 3 sources of power for the arch-mage villain (eye of Odin, book of grimorum, and the Phoenix gate) 

This led to the avalon storyline, a great one, which in turned led to Angela, one of my favorite newly introduced gargoyles (I love how sweet she is, indicating that a home of love and nurture is key to how good a person can be, contrasting with Demona) 

THAT led in turn to the 20 episode arc that could have been a season all its own in which Goliath, Elisa, Bronx, and Angela travel on a boat to many different locales, solving problems throughout each area, coming toe to toe with the pack, xanatos , and assorted other villain, but also other gargoyles! That was fun to see. 

I was also excited to finally see Oberon and titania, as well as Oberon's children, and the plot line with xanatos and fox's baby. 

Oh, I could talk about Gargoyles endlessly, I love the show so much.  </TEXT>

And I don't want that in games. I'm quite fine with the cheesy bad English voice acting for companies who can't afford any better, since I know they can't be final Fantasy 12 levels of voice acting. And I'm ok with that. Just leave it in English. Since ideally the battle system is fun enough to not mind endearingly cheesy lines, for example star ocean 3 </TEXT>

Then they moved to the escapist, then they moved to penny arcade... I kinda lost track and interest in both video games and them by that point. Still always enjoy what they stand for: a better video game industry.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Damn shame, it was everything the psp should have been back in 2005, just simply having 2 analog sticks is a huge game changer...

But it seems there are no games developing for it, no big AAA games from publishers, hell even square enix seems to have given it a pass and not even given it its own kingdom hearts like with psp, which would actually work better this time around since the handheld has actual analog sticks to move the characters around and stuff.

The handheld is still priced at $200, which is only $50 less than a ps4... that probably doesn't sound too enticing to new buyers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like:

- Honest Trailers for movies

- Dorkly for video game related humor

- How it should have ended (also for movies)

- TeamFourStar's DBZ Abridged and Hellsing Abridged for hilarious takes on said shows

- ASAPscience and/or vsauce for anything sciency related

- collegehumor's 2009-2011 videos for just generally fun silly type comedy

- smbc theater

The last 2 don't really update anymore but they have some classic stuff from a decade ago that I find rather hilarious. The others still update regularly and if you've never seen them before have a ton of archived content to get through. Each has relatively specific set of humor for whatever kind you enjoy.

I also enjoy dry humor but haven't really come across channels that do that, only webcomics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably because infamous's sequel was all over the place and didn't quite know what to do with itself. I think maybe they should have just dropped the whole "karma" system and focused on doing just a fun game. Either that or at least at the start of the game pick if you're going to be evil or "good" so you unlock the special exclusive powers and missions for the one you chose. 

Because other than its over the top Grimdark setting, infamous WAS a fun game. I liked 2 for having a better melee system, since infamous 1 was basically a shooter disguised as a superhero game and since I hate shooters I kept playing it as a melee game but got my butt kicked due to how tough and precise enemies were with their bullets. But I enjoyed the climbing mechanics (you can definitely see the sly Cooper inspiration here) and open world feel. I just don't think they planned for much of a story and hit a wall after coming up with the concept of the apocalyptic "beast" character as the premise of the game. Then didn't know what to do after that.  </TEXT>

Ratchet and clank is through and through a shooter (albeit a fun one with a great sense of humor and guns that turn enemies into sheep, fun stuff like that) and the less said about jak and daxter  the better, another shootery type. Sly Cooper is the only one that stayed true to its roots as a platformer and never lost sight of its fun Saturday morning cartoon look in an industry that was shifting away from fun and eventually entering the brown-and-bloom shooter gen with bald space marines who smoke spit and swear all the time.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Following a gen of annoying collectathons, the first Sly Cooper was almost a reprieve with its straight platforming with no added mumbo jumbo. Sure there were the bottles to collect but it was just that, the platforming was the core of the game. The thing that brings it down is those tedious minigames, which unfortunately plague the series for some unknown reason. But being a Racoon that climbs stuff was a fun gameplay mechanic. 

Then we have Sly 2, one of the best sequels that improves upon the original and is an open world mission based sneaking around game, best of which is it didn't devolve into a gta clone like a certain other Sony property. The best thing about the Sly series for people who love platformers is that it stayed a platformer throughout, as well as retaining its lightheartedness and sense of humor. 

Sly 2 is amazing, like seriously amazing, true there were some minigames but its the kind of sequel that really does rock. Love what they did with the Klaww gang and bringing Clockwerk back in that manner. The whole Arpeggio a bird who cant fly bit. Actually the entire Sly Cooper series has this sympathetic villains thing, I love it. This series isnt given enough credit, it really isnt. Essentially it's like a heist film brought to life in video game form, best way to describe it.

Sly 3 unfortunately was a step back, or rather just a stumbling sidestep before falling down. The game feels  rushed (released only one year after Sly 2) AND they wasted precious developer time on silly 3d. The blue-and-red cheap glasses in the box kind of 3d. It was basically Sly 2 but even more minigames and you barely play as the Sly so much as you do every other furry friend of the Cooper gang.

Sly 4 is a surprising, very surprising return to form. And by a different developer no less! Yeah they had a lot of good ideas here, and a lot of them worked. Only problem is I wanted more, they coulda done more, but I dont blame them especially after the stories I hear concerning budget and time restrictions.

Overall, it's still a fun series, and makes you wish there were more platformers of its kind with fun stuff like sneaking around, gorgeous cel-shaded graphics that give it a Saturday Morning Cartoon feel (you just don't see that anymore) </TEXT>

This is one of those instant classic movies that I immediately fell in love with. It's just so amazing. The beautiful visuals, the story that hits close to home (the lyrics "find happiness right where you are" particularly struck a chord with me) and how it has a classic odyssey type adventure feel of a character going on a journey, overcoming obstacles and returning home changed, wiser, ready to lead, very classic "hero with a thousand faces" type journey done in a spectacular manner. </TEXT>

Although, rewatching the show now has made me realize that they actually cut out quite a few scenes in the vhs tape release compared to the actual episode. It's little things, but these little things become very important plot points later on in the series, like the gargoyle eggs. </TEXT>

There are some things that annoy me (regenerating health stupidity over having health potions like in the ezio trilogy) but I weirdly enjoy sailing when in 3 I hated it at the beginning.

<TEXT> It is much more annoying and tedious to run around like a doofus waiting for the health to regenerate on its own, and is too reminiscent of the shooter genre which I personally am not a fan of. 

Plus I feel being able to have health potions at hand is a consolation prize for all the bugs and glitches the ac series has, such as continually swinging at enemy for some reason doesn't seem to register as a kill despite said enemy stumbling and getting blood spurts and flesh wounds all over the place. </TEXT>

It's a damn shame because Ralph had such a fun unique setting and is one of the very few instances of incorporating video games into the setting and story well. 

Just a damn shame the academy couldn't look past "ew video games" and most people didn't see it.  </TEXT>

Back in 2004 it was just this fun movie that came out, but every rewatch shows something more to the movie, be it how amazing it looks to bringing back the swashbuckler type movie (really only it and the mask of zorro seem to be the only swashbuckler types in the modern age...) to just how damn funny the lines are. And yet at the same time can get super serious and dark for a disney produced movie.  Geoffrey rush's portrayal of a pirate is still 10/10.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is cornmeal better for pizza dough than typical flour? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I was just wondering about that. The problem I've noticed with some pizza and pizza places here is that the bottom of the pizza is all powdery and has that uncomfortable dry/chalky feeling when you hold the pizza slices, because of all the flour. 

But with cornmeal I don't get that dry chalky feeling that flour gives. It actually feels quite nice, has an enjoyably rough texture to it. 

Wondering if cornmeal for pizza dough is something people use over other types? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was Maui really gonna leave Moana trapped inside the cave to starve or die of thirst to death or something? It's played for laughs but when you consider the fridge horror logic of it, kinda makes you frown a bit. Even Shrek didn't put the boulder to cover the cave on Princess Fiona back in Shrek 1 (although that was because Donkey cried at him not to) so this is especially surprising. 

It's one thing to keep throwing Moana into the ocean (although as dark as Pirates of the Caribbean marooning their pirates on an island, perhaps darker since there's no pistol with a single shot to use) but to leave her trapped in a cave and purposefully put a boulder on the entrance...  </TEXT>

Moana was great, fantastic, and just really all around amazing. I knew I was gonna enjoy the movie, but I just had no idea how much I was going to fall in love with the art, the animation, and the soundtrack! It's really a stupendous movie.

Nearly every song in that movie was amazing. I particularly love the islander type music, which is why it's so amazing, and I don't know if I have a favorite song, but I did deeply enjoy you're welcome.

That scene where Maui makes his pecs dance, that was the moment I knew the Rock voiced him even if I didn't know the rock was in this movie simply because that is such a thing The Rock would do lol.

And though the song is essentially to trick Moana and steal her boat and leave her trapped in a cave (without even a box of scraps) I still can't help loving it and being captivated by him.

Such a fantastic, deeply emotional movie, I had to watch it twice in succession because it was just. that. good. 

But what the hell at that box office gross? Should have grossed at least a billion if not more.... </TEXT>

By the way the stubbornness of Moana makes me realize that I'd really like to see a new Disney Extended universe  where Moana, Tangled, and Frozen all meet with each other in some capacity, like the avengers thor iron man etc.

But yeah everything about this movie is completely on point, I haven't felt this great about a Disney movie since they released another amazing stellar movie in the same year (Zootopia) what was up with them releasing 2 fantastic movies in one year instead of spacing them out and not letting them compete with each other over the same oscar.

<TEXT> Well I rejected those answers, and built this city, my city... **Rapture**.


I absolutely loved Bioshock. Bizarrely weird tonal shift in ending aside ( the "good" ending at least) I think I just played one of the best games of all time. Even as someone who hates shooters, I absolutely enjoyed this. Mostly because of the whole powers thing, which allows you to get creative as opposed to rooty tooty pointy and shooty stuff of the genre.

I love how atmospheric and sometimes even creepy the game is, combine that with the old school pre 50s art and instructional videos on the powers, and it just works. so. darn. well.

The city of Rapture is probably still one of the best environments in gaming ever, and I hope something that entertaining can be matched by games in the future because it's been 10 years and no game has come close! </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair, I have never liked anything scary either... or that is, anything in the horror/thriller category. But Gargoyles is something unique and wonderful. Plus to be fair the only episode that ever really scared me is the jackal episode, and I know this because it's one of the episodes (or a particular scene from the episode) that I still remember to this day, *over 20 years later* because that's how scarring it was for me hehe. 

I don't know if it will come to that american invented streaming device known as netflix, all I do know is that disney like all the other big name companies are going to be starting their **own** streaming service as they have realized the success of netflix but don't want to give them any money, so want the netflix userbase for themselves. If that means we'll get gargoyles, who knows. There's a topic on this very reddit website that states that disney is streaming the gargoyles show on youtube for what that's worth, but you'll have to find out for yourself because it only works for americans (like most youtube "official" streaming content) not for the rest of us.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That show was my childhood, I simply devoured the stories of the gargoyles, and Goliath's voice gives me goosebumps every time. I also loved Elisa Maza.

Had so many of the toys and action figures, some when the gargoyles were in stone form, others where they were in regular form. 

I particularly found it cool when in school we started learning about Shakespeare plays and I realized where names like Demona or Puck came from.  

But when I joined the internet I found out this show struggled with the ratings? It's not fair. This show should have been watched by all, it is amazing.

Any memories you have concerning gargoyles? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Day At the Races and My Jiggly Ball are some of the best episodes of television so I don't know what to tell you man. My Day at The Races is particularly inspiring on a personal level for me because I remember watching that episode as a teenager and thinking "by the time I hit 30 I hope to have accomplished plenty myself" as well as of course, be fit enough to run a triathlon. 

There is of course, a clear noticeable difference between the first 3 seasons, and then season 4, season 5, and onwards. In the beginning while the show still had a lot of quirky moments it still had a lot of... dark stuff. But by season 4 it really becomes lighthearted, a change that's mostly marked by the fact that Jordan lightens up considerably and acts just as goofy as the rest of the cast, when in season 1 she was the antagonist and "typical ice queen bitchy character" type person. 

Then season 5 happens and it's even lighter, but still has a lot of emotional moments. As a matter of fact I think some of the emotional moments hit even harder because of it (like the Dr Kelso episode where the song Sideways plays)

Season 6 is where the drop in quality happens, but since I love the show so much I don't even care, because it still has some great moments. But just throwing it out there. Season 7 they try to bring it back to form but also simultaneously suffered from the writer's strike, and finally we have season 8 which sweetly wraps all the old cast's lives in a nice bow even if they wasted way too many episodes and scenes of episodes on the new interns, which is even more infuriating when you realize they didn't even bother using said interns for the spin-off! So basically they wasted season 8 and our time with those new interns for no reason. But ah well no biggie.  </TEXT>

Sucks about your parents, sorry that not one but *both* were smokers, that's just unfathomable. I remember when I found out that my dad was actually a smoker in his youth (quit by the time he married and had us) and was utterly shocked, namely because he is a doctor, and when I'd complain about the presence of smoking in this culture and how it could lead to lung cancer, he'd just go "naahh you're just overblowing the issue" which left me incredulous at such a response.

<TEXT> I just don't know. As a compare and contrast, I go back to play old games from the snes, n64 and ps1 era on that very same tv and while they're all pixelated as hell, they still have text that's way more readable than in HD games of post gen 7 because the font is so huge.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You mean, with an HDMI cable? Yes. But let me ask you a question, how far do people typically sit away from the tv when playing a console game? Because from the lack of complaints, I get the impression that some gamers have a chair that they prop up just inches away from the TV while I like to sit a good few meters away, especially with a large tv in the living room type setup. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't need to, we have them here... developing world is a whole different world. Which is annoying because at least in america, smoking has a bad rap and it's banned in workplaces/restaurants/malls and that law is *enforced*, but in developing countries smoking is still perfectly ok and done everywhere. I actually am considering walking around in a gas mask. Rather be ridiculed and get looks on the street than spend one more day of one more year of my life breathing into my shirt to try and avoid that horrible, horrible stink of cigarattes and whatnot. </TEXT>

When I shift to 16:9 everything becomes smaller so that more of it fits the screen and I'm like, I don't need to see everything all at once game companies!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're glad? I'm ecstatic! I was getting really annoyed with the trolls on the forums of the websites gamespot and gamefaqs consistently denying the font of ps3 (and I assume, 360) games are small, when they absolutely are. I remember trying to read the subtitles while playing this game called Red Dead Redemption and just throwing my hands in the air out of frustration. 

Another one is Assassin's Creed 3, a game with a huge database but Ubisoft almost seems to be saying "fuck you, don't read this" because not only is the text absolutely minuscule, but the screen actually has near epilepsy causing lightning-esque flashes constantly to simulate the Animus loading screen look. Every time you open the menu. Every time. 

For the life of me, I cannot understand how this isn't something that's brought up more. Really feel vindicated in finally finding others who share the same viewpoint concerning this issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> AKA the "HD" gen? It seems in an effort to squeeze as much of the  game's graphics onto the screen as possible, the post gen 6 games seem obsessed with making the font (either for subtitles, or in-game database) incredibly small, and for the life of me I can't understand it or understand how no one has mentioned it. 

I mean the font is noticeably small. I sit about 4-5 meters away from the tv, a 65 inch one. I don't know what everyone else's setup is with console games, but there's definitely a difference between the font of a snes game or ps2 game, and then a ps3 game. 

It's one of those things in video games that I wonder why no one mentions, as someone who personally enjoys reading, especially in-game databases of various types of games, from rpg to action adventure.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's pretty much everything I ever wanted from a comic book but never found; great art and colors matching the cartoon show exactly, with the same writing, lighthearted at times, heartfelt at others, just great all around.

I definitely recommend them. I'm usually not into comics but I love BTAS so much that I knew I would like the comics as they're pretty much like reading a story panel for an episode of BTAS but in comic form. They have some characters that weren't in the show, some sillier than others (the perfessor, mr nice and mastermind, who are kinda 3 stoogesish but still have their moments of funny) and others have stories that pick up where the show left off. 

Definitely would like to talk about them with anyone who has read them.  </TEXT>

digital marketing and content marketing is still only a theory that hasn't been applied for businesses. I've been trying to spearhead it to make a name for myself (for example, the company I finally went to didn't have any social media presence and I suggested for them to at the very least have a facebook and twitter account. Just *something* to start them out and actually post in it, not make it and leave it dead, a classic mistake that I've seen often) </TEXT>

As for driving while I don't really go driving in the desert often, it's nice to have just in case I do since other people use the car to go to the chalet and stuff. I just like a bigger car for comfort but not too big that parking is a hassle.  </TEXT>

It's just the opposite actually concerning accidentally skipping text, because you sometimes want to press the confirm button quickly so all the text appears at once and accidentally miss a sentence when you press too fast in succession. This problem wouldn't exist when the text appears all at once, so you don't have to do that until you read the entire dialogue box, without waiting for more words to slowly scroll into view.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Especially for those that don't have the option for the text to appear instantly onscreen. Honestly it's unfathomable. When you read a book, you're not waiting for the goddamn words to scroll onto the pages, they're right there for you to read.

It seems like such a little thing, but when you're playing a text heavy jrpg with a lot of reading, or a visual novel, or text adventure, or whatever it may be, you don't want to be constantly waiting for the text to scroll, since most people don't just read one word or letter at a time, we take it all in...

I dunno, it's just one of those things in video games, like crappy sound mixing and tiny font, that no one ever complains about despite it being a pressing problem that hasn't been fixed and keeps getting worse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing with Holt is that the first time he subverted the audience/jake's expectations by participating in jake's shenanigans/roleplays, it was *hilarious*. It completely killed everyone in the audience. 

But come season 4, they kept doing it and it sometimes didn't feel as natural, like when jake skates across a recently waxed floor in his socks (gross by the way) and Holt comes into the office holding jake's arm up in celebration shouting "full room!" Or whatever. It just didn't feel as funny or nearly as organic as the time he yelled "hot damn" when guessing the correct reason Santiago was late, which was a pretty 10/10 moment.

But otherwise I don't notice a problem at all with Holt being... casual? Casual how, what do you mean by that? </TEXT>

I love Lizzy Caplan, and enjoy her in pretty much everything I've seen her in.

But now Cece is still fierce and awesome,  just not a stereotypical ice cold person. Last season when she told jess about Schmidt rubbing off on her and crying at the old couple in the bank commercial, I cracked up like crazy.  </TEXT>

As for scifi, I think the only book series I've read that could be classified as scifi (at least somewhat) is KA Applegate's *Animorphs*, my childhood's favorite book series that will always hold a special place in my heart. *Remnants* was okay, but *Animorphs* pretty much defined my childhood.

<TEXT> I mostly find myself reading classic literature the past few years. Anything from The Count of Monte Cristo to Oliver Twist to Moby Dick. I liked Rudyard Kipling's the jungle book 1 and 2. 

I especially like mystery novels, was **really** into Agatha Christie, anything from the classic *And Then There Were None* to my favorite of the bunch, *Crooked House* and several more. 

Also read the collection of short stories of Sherlock Holmes, vol 1. I have vol 2 but still haven't read it (saving it for the summer depending on how my plans go)

So really most of the oldschool stuff. I have read young adult books, like darren shan and percy jackson, but they were a bit after my time. Oh you know what book series I was able to get 2 years ago, was the Silverwing trilogy. I read one of the books in middle school in the library but never was able to find the sequels. Still haven't read it but sometimes I enjoy something small like that just to breeze through before sinking my teeth into something heavier like *A Tale of Two Cities*. </TEXT>

I tried this reddit website but the television and movies sub are both more concerned with movie news and gossip, than the actual movies themselves; more concerned with behind the scenes going ons and props or movie posters being used than the actual movies themselves. Nothing wrong with that but... they're the highest thumbed up posts with like, 1000 comments! While any post I make wanting to discuss specific movies and shows, and similarly hear input by others on them, well they only get 3-4 posts at most. Sometimes if I'm lucky I'll get more posts and think I've finally found people to discuss it with but I honestly don't understand the format of this website and what determines which topic will become popular enough to receive a lot of input.

I dunno. Just feel like there have to be others in the similar boat I'm in, I mean nearly 8 billion in the world? Just has to be...  </TEXT>

They've been throwing money at us since ac 2 with it being all but useless but then include really expensive stuff in ac 3 and not much of a way to make money?

Ah well it's not biggie. I won't bother with naval missions, but the thing is I was looking forward to playing AC 4 since people kept telling me it was "the good one" but if the game is entirely comprised of sailing then I can't imagine that to be true. Even if it's improved over AC 3, the core of sailing that I have seen so far is very tedious and not fun. I dunno, hoping for the best here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm liking ac 3 so far, and the Frontier is quite beautiful to run through. 

However the naval missions are beyond vexing. I tried doing the chase and kept losing the objective to keep the merchant ship I'm supposed to protect above 50% hp for the duration of the mission. 

So I thought maybe ship upgrades would render the naval missions super easy, at least I hope. Of course said upgrades are like, SUPER expensive and I haven't found a real way to make bank yet. 

I started sending my 3 recruits so far on assassin missions, but the money turnover is kinda pennies compared to the extreme price of ship part upgrades. 

Are there any practical ways to make money in this game, or no more bank getting 20,000 money every 20 minutes like in the ezio AC games?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first thing I thought of during the opening was that the upside down buildings and running on them was *exactly* what I wanted out of inception, which teased walking vertically up a building in the trailer but never **did** anything else with it. The psychedelic nature of some of the scenes was the kind of thing I wanted out of a movie about dreams. 

Anyway, the movie was amazing, with extremely sharp, well placed moments of comedy to relieve the tension, very well done. I particularly loved the mister doctor exchange. I honestly couldn't get enough, when the movie ended I could have sat for another 2 hours and watched more, more. It sets up for sequels while still maintaining a good resolution on its own, unlike some other movies. 

But oh shit, Mordo becomes a bad guy? Damn. That was... sudden. I do recall Mordo being a bad guy name but I didn't think... not like this. The whole sword on his back totally gave me flashbacks to The Operative from the Firefly movie Serenity. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-02-26 20:55:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Family Matters was supposed to be this typical 80s family sitcom, almost Cosbyish. But one day they introduced this new character Steve Urkel who 90s American people seemed to love for some reason, like a black guy in suspenders and dorky glasses was automatic humor (I dunno)

The point being, when that happened it turned into the Steve Urkel show, focusing entirely on this guy's exploits and shunting off the rest of the family to appear if only briefly.

New Girl on the other hand started off revolving around this quirky Zooey Deschanel type who gets into wacky or perhaps even zany adventures, but people watching the show started to love the side characters way more like Nick, Schmidt and Winston, especially Schmidt.

So instead of the one quirky character, the ensemble was loved in New Girl, while in Family Matters the one quirky character was loved.

Just thought that was interesting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wonder where they're going with this. Especially the LMD bots still roaming around right now, and all the daisy clones, wonder what the implications there are.

It would be nice to see Ward again... is it weird that I like him? I do love to hate all the bad things he's done, but... I dunno. I just really like the actor.

Ideally I'd like to see bobbi again, can't believe they booted her off, isn't Mockingbird like an integral part of shield? I know they were going to do a spin off with her and the dogface hunter, but even I knew that wasn't a good idea and I love AoS and Agent Carter (shame it got canceled)

Think we'll see ghost rider before season's end or has that been put to bed? I always wondered if the person on the bike who gave robbie his ghosting powers was the original ghost rider, like from the comics.

I also don't understand, the whole person who was funding watch dogs and an American senator was some random russian nobody? That's anti climactic (and yes I know the actual show makes fun of this but still doesn't make it any less weird). Why would an american senator with a fancy house and s*** call some russian nobody "the superior" ?

It just makes no sense. Speaking of I wonder if not robbie but rather the senator's inhuman brother, will we see him again? Still 6 or 7 episodes to go I think? Well this season is definitely shaping up to be a lot more interesting than last.

Shame about radcliffe. Even when he was so clearly evil I liked him, the actor just has this charm about him. Liked it less when his end game was some minority report esque matrix paradise situation, since I'd rather he just be mad scientist evil...

Wonder if we'll ever get more explanations about the "Darkhold" or if it will continue to just be this macguffin like thing that holds all the keys to the universe and is more powerful seemingly than even the infinity stones or whatever.

Young may was adorable, really liked the scenes with her and phil, love the banter.

However, I'm really not a fan of this recent... ugh I can't even say it. Why can't a man and a woman on TV just be really close friends? There are other forms of love besides romantic. Was anyone else put-off by that, especially the kiss? Just wondering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, like when you're watching a show with actual friends and are commenting on each awe striking thing as it comes along, I get that. 

I don't think it really works on the internet though... does it? I like to immerse myself in the show and go "aw damn!" at moments and then when the episode is over discuss about it to not be spoiled on anything that might happen next, but wouldn't want to pause the episode and interrupt the action to type in the middle of it...

I only ask because I don't know which topic I'm supposed to post in if they're both at the top of the sub, because this last episode was like DAMMN. And in the future I hope to come by here a lot more and discuss because I've been a fan of this show for 2 years and absolutely loved it from premiere to this recent episode.  </TEXT>

Was curious if someone could give me some opinions on the movies, what they're like, that sort of thing. I grew up with the dcau which are some pretty big shoes to fill, and also watched young justice which was criminally canceled despite being really good.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We can't even eat the skin of fish anymore because it absorbs all the toxins. And because of how the food chain works, the mercury in one small fish is absorbed by a larger fish that at the small fish, so when humans eat the larger fish they intake ALL the mercury of both the small and large fish. 

But no one seems to be as bothered by it, when it's really something that'sto quote batman:the brave and the bold's aquamanoutrageous.

<TEXT> Ps3 was the original platform, ps4 has apparently better graphics and performance? I was wondering about that. I don't care too much about graphics, but more so about lack of loading times, no framerate drops or screen tearing, basically the things that make a game run smoothly and consistently. That kind of thing. 

So I'm wondering which one is the better in that regard.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> A message to all movies: Don't bother doing actions scenes if you're just gonna do sloppy editing and quick jump cuts and weird angles. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-17 12:07:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Especially with American movies compared to say classic hong kong (either wuxia or realistic, from the well known jackie chans and jet lis and chow yun fats to lesser known actors) or korean (the hallway scene in oldboy) or most asian production movies, with their unedited fight scenes, still camera that actually shows the martial art prowess and action. 

I mean, it's simply inexcusable in this day and age, when even the best movies, with their great plot lines and fantastic characters, tend to suffer this western trait of having sloppy editing, shaky cam (bourne series ugh) all over the place, and jump cuts that really distort more than enhance the experience to make the viewer believe they're actually witnessing a fight scene. 

I don't know if there's a proper solution since martial art prowess takes years to master and Western movies are on a tight schedule, but I just... I just don't think shaky cam and quick editing and the worst of them all, shooting in the dark to mask the terrible editing/fighting, is the answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only without the Hollywood happy ending. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_(film)

It's this very sweet movie about a good natured 34 year old who is still single and constantly pressured by his friends and family to be married, only he just hasn't really met anyone. He's not super handsome or anything, nor suave, just a nice sweet kind of guy. 

And the thing is, I know that in real life that story as of 2017 doesn't really happen to have the happy ending that some of the more innocent black and white movies of old display. 

I dunno. I just realized that I'm a meager 6 years away from becoming that age and having never had something even resembling a romantic relationship with *anyone*, much less a woman.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> OH man, don't even get me started on those CW shows... but here's the thing. Just like how barney and teletubbies are strictly for the children demographic, those CW shows are strictly for the teenager-twenty-something collegiate demographic. Those CW shows are basically teenage drama but with actors who are in their 20s, and the writing/plotlines reflect that. 

I mean hey, 15 years ago I was a teenager and I used to watch Smallville, back before there even was a CW. And I still like it out of nostalgia, though I'd never call it a good show, it's terrible. But it was *my* terrible. And that's what the CW shows are. They're for a very specific demographic and not really for people who want something, you know, good.  </TEXT>

Not having tov ps3 in English is one of the most bizarre unexplainable business decisions ever. 

I still remember back in late 2008 when we got eternal sonata for ps3, and it very clearly was meant to be an appetizer for tales of vesperia, since both games were released on 360 first before being ported to ps3. I don't know what happened roughly 8 years ago though that made the English version of ps3 vesperia seem nonexistent.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Huh... that's surprisingly similar to my situation too, at least some of it. I had always known *of* anime, but it wasn't until 2009 that I started watching when I was super depressed because of an accident (an incident shall we say) that completely changed the course of my life. A friend of mine had always talked about this stuff and once I had started to watch the big popular ones like nge, cowboy bebop, death note etc, I went back to him hoping to discuss it but he had already started phasing out of it. 

By the end of 2010 I has reached my peak depression and consumed a ton of anime media, up until the disappointment of a certain show kind of soured me on the entire medium and I kind of just didn't watch it much anymore.  </TEXT>

I also don't want to mindlessly consume a bunch of it because the pleasure centers of the brain shrink when overexposed so I want to try and moderate it, especially since I can't truly appreciate something when I'm watching it as a distraction from life. 

I also haven't read any classic literature recently because of that, I don't feel like I'll truly appreciate it in this frame of mind. If I do end up doing the plan I have for the summer, I'll be taking a bunch of books with me to read, and no other form of technology for entertainment venue.

<TEXT> Maybe it's because I don't live in America but, why don't you show up in person to apply for a job instead of doing something semi-anonymously online and complain about the amount of hoops you have to go through? The fact of the matter is when it comes to jobs, it's about who you know, and when people say that they stress the importance of starting internships and the like early so you establish connections and relationships so that you have more references to call upon and more likelihood to get a job. Companies aren't just going to hire anyone, they want someone they feel can give them what they want, and you just have to present yourself as such. 

I dunno, just something I've noticed. It's tough, I'll give you that. Very very tough. But I guess it kinda has to be that way.  </TEXT>

It really shows how the creators of these shows think on their feet, adapt to changes, and create a fantastic show. We're in for a new wave of comedic genius, not to mention originality (considering how tgp ended, taking most viewers completely by surprise)

<TEXT> As opposed to classic action hero movies that featured closeups of the guys biceps, muscular chest, and firm buttocks? Hell the shoemaker batman movies actually featured nipples on the bat suit and a ton of ass shots... 

While I agree regarding empowerment and the overt sexuality of western society, it's not exactly something exclusive to women. And I think that's equality, showing sex appeal of men for women's benefit, so as to break the stereotype of only men enjoying eye candy or having expression of sexuality presented while women remain on a pedestal as not enjoying it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Off the top of my head, some of the more memorable female roles for me were Sarah Conner in Terminator 2 and (this might seem a strange choice for some) the mouse mother mrs brisby in Secret of Nimh, Don Bluth's first and easily best animated movie. And what these strong female lead roles of old share is that they're all mothers, or wives, and have got something to protect, such as a younger son/daughter/baby, or maybe an incapacitated husband.

 But I can't recall a role where it was just a female as a heroine simply as a woman, not a wife or mother. At least, in a movie that's actually really good, and doesn't prop up said protagonist's gender as the only thing of note. So essentially what you mention regarding pushing changes in inauthentic ways. And it's also insulting to all involved, since it's like blaxploitation films of old where simply being a different race or creed or whatever is the only thing of note, and instead of designing all new characters to be written for roles, it's simply "what if we take established character... and make them female??" which is actually more insulting than it is empowering (as opposed to creating a role specifically for a person) or at least I tend to think so, since I would be insulted if they made a character whose entire purpose is just that he shares the same ethnicity as me or stuff like that. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thoughts on how blockbuster movies nowadays have females be the hero instead of the damsel in distress? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-05 21:07:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was thinking about how in star wars 7, they made a female the hero instead of the damsel in distress. And she's the one who "rescues" the guy.

I wonder if the movie would have been nearly as successful if they went with the traditional format of a guy being the hero who fights the bad guys to rescue the screaming damsel. Indiana Jones 2 was on TV and I was just thinking about how things were so different 30 years ago, with the love interest just constantly screaming the entire movie and/or being put in eye candy type clothing. 

Just want to hear different opinions from people on here on the changing dynamics of blockbuster movies and the like.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) The first movie that everyone loves, that's amazing and came out of nowhere and is infinitely rewatchable to this day.

2) The sequel that came out a few years later that... everyone was sort of on board for... and at least had cool scenes and set pieces (like the kraken from PotC, or the freeway scene/twin albinos who who you were just waiting to see how their fight with Neo would have been like since they do a disappearing act thing but Neo can see the code so... ??? We'll never know how such a fight would have turned out)

- Tried to bog the movie down in its own lore.

- Had a cliffhanger ending that panned to the face of a character we were shocked to see! (Barbossa moreso than... human Smith, of course)

3) And finally the third, disappointing one (though one could argue potc at least had a better resolution than... whatever matrix 3 was)

- and interestingly, both got rid of the cool thing that people remember from the second one for some conspicuous reason, that being the kraken from potc and twin ghost albinos from matrix. Much to the chagrin of a lot of fans.

- oh also, both sequels were filmed back to back for both franchises, and the they were released very close to each other.

It's not uncommon for trilogies to do this so you'll notice a lot of similarities with other franchises (particularly the sequel hook, that's a given) but I thought matrix and potc in particular shared a lot more than the usual. </TEXT>

There's one video from x-art with her and taylor sands that's near perfect, if it wasn't for the disappointing ending. But still a great video. 

As for her boyfriend they broke up, but prior to that they had an amazing set of videos from the cashforsextape series, where they go out on dates, talk to each other, actually communicate, have sex in spontaneous places, and when they're finally alone have a lot of the good kind of dirty talk because they're actually a couple and it's been... built up. </TEXT>

<TITLE> If Japanese porn's creampies combined with Western porn's sexually liberated women that actually enjoy sex, we'd have the perfect porn video. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Japanese understand the catharsis of seeing the guy cum inside the woman, several times in one video in fact, which is perfect,  especially when seeing it dripping out and then he continues for a second round (and there's so much of it too, which is great)

But as everyone knows, Japanese is horrible because of the cultural belief that women should be crying, squealing and generally unhappy during sex, something that they have to "endure" for the man instead of enjoy. The big problem with Japanese porn. 

That's where western porn comes in. Just need to see women actually enjoying the sex and better yet, take active charge of their pleasure by grinding on top of the guy and smiling and actually climaxing on camera, and have the copious amounts of creampie that japanese porn has. 

That I believe, will make the perfect porn video.  </TEXT>

What was the end game here, just have these 4 be slightly annoyed at a not-so-paradisiacal paradise where things are not quite right? People will adapt eventually, just like that woman did in the medium place.

If a medium place does exist, why not more people there?

Why didn't Eleanor just write something like "this is the bad place" so that she knows immediately the next time, maybe add in a "get used to it" or something. Just have the spoiler immediately so she can deal with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or how it always starts with blowjob, penetration, different position, then jerking off. I personally don't care for the blowjob at all, and normal guys don't need it at all to be erect, simply there being a woman who wants to have sex with them is enough to make a guy rock hard.

In terms of the formulaic nature of porn, I suggest more teasing. Let's say the guy is lying down and the girl is about to sit on him, the tip's almost near the entrance... but she gets up. And he's maybe tied down, struggling to enter her by thrusting his hips, but she's teasing him and teasing him until he can take no more, and then when it does happen it's ***soooo*** much more satisfying. Or another favorite of mine, the almost kiss. They're about to kiss, just an inch from each other, tongues almost out... but it doesn't happen yet. Not yet... not yet... and then: ecstasy. 

If there was forum for porn creators to actually get input from the audience, I'd throw in all these suggestions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You... *want* to see what is essentially another dude jack off? With a woman's face in the background? But still essentially a dude desperately mashing it to produce the "money"shot? 

Like any visual medium, porn should make use of the imagination, it's not just what's on the surface, it's also what's implied, it's about seeing more than just the colors onscreen, the visual medium of movies offers both sight and sound and something deeper, atmosphere, that can only be created with a right combination of the many elements that make up a video. 

You keep saying visual, but I feel you're missing a profound element of the visual, not to mention you're basically saying you're more interested in seeing another guy's orgasm than the woman's? As far as nothing to "see", that's also a weird thing to say considering creampies are a thing. Real ones of course.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, no condom is a given, and as for relationship porn my personal go-to for completion is when she deeply tongue kisses him while he's inside her, especially at the moment of completion. I *do* like the actual act of penetration, but I like deep kissing way more, especially when they're in the lotus position. By far my favorite. If they're not kissing, then I want them to communicate to each other about kissing, or just what makes them feel good, like rubbing the girl down there, or nibbling on an earlobe... stuff like that.

One scene I always liked is where the guy goes down  on the girl for a change and is enthusiastically eating her pussy, and then goes back up to deeply kisses her and asks her how good she tastes, then back down and up again, before neither the participants nor the audience can take it anymore, and he finally sticks it in her. So satisfying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, do guys seriously even like that? A lot of the mainstream American porn devotes like 5-10 minutes of the guy trying to jerk himself off while the girl just kneels there with her mouth open and a glazed look in her eyes. How did entire generations and millions of people find that remotely erotic?

For my part, I enjoy the catharsis of seeing the guy come inside the woman, or that they "came at the same time" which might be impractical but fantasy wise is my favorite.

I'm just curious because it's the most common type of video ending, they even used a term for it in the industry, the moneyshot </TEXT>

I knew it I knew it I knew it. Ok I didn't know it but... the very first episode when he was talking about the feeling of an otter holding hands, and how everything was rosy colored and whatever, I was thinking, isn't that a little too cloying? Is heaven really a place where you just live forever and there's no suffering, no way to work, overcome obstacles, grow and do the basic thing of what humans do? It's like the first matrix, which was a disaster, so that's just weird. And the frozen yogurt places... that's not my idea of heaven, because I detest froyo, it makes me throw up like all dairy and dairy like products do. And the way Tahani was condescending, right away I was thinking there had to be something up with that. OH and lest we forget, the clowns? Seriously the clowns? That would have been the biggest give-away if I wasn't so distracted by everything that was going on, but clowns have always been evil, and the ledge with no stairs, I mean there's no person whose ideal home is a house that has clown pictures... that was dead give away. I made a mental note of those things from the beginning. Chidi's reasoning for getting into "the bad place" was super weak but I let it slide. That laugh Ted Danson did... literally terrifying. </TEXT>

My favorite thing I'd say so far is how I went from disliking the initially condescending british accented lady to immediately liking her only a few minutes later and finding her hilarious, I like how this show is portraying people, I've never changed my opinion on a person so quickly before.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look, I really *want* to like megan plastic face fox character on new girl because so far she's becoming less unlikable and is slightly emoting more, so that's nice instead of the consistent resting bitch face, but jesus christ I can't look at that ugly face, it's so damn plasticy and caked in like, 10 years' worth of plastic surgery. I just don't understand why showrunner elizabeth merriwether got this woman out of all women to be on the show. Is it because the last name is fox and new girl is on the fox channel? I dunno, I just... I dunno.
Lizzy Caplan's Julia from season 1 was basically the same role first, a lot prettier, a lot funnier, and should have been on the show a lot longer (they just wrote her out so poorly, but they do that with all the good boyfriends and girlfriends of nick/jess for some reason, they just don't know how to write them out organically)
I'm invested in the show so it really bothers that fox hasn't left yet, just do the break up already. Otherwise you know I kind of don't mind the season, definitely hate it less than season 5, and that's as big a compliment as one can give with a show that's starting to lose steam and seemingly knows it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Batman is so broken that we'll probably never see a good live action version, he's better suited to cartoons. To be a good live action version he needs to have the martial arts prowess of Hong Kong action movies, with none of the quick sloppy editing that defines western action movies, and also have the strong characterization of western movies. 
The suit would probably also need to be cgi'd like black panther was, to give him full fluidity of movement, and do the awesome stunts that batman of the arkham games does. Could you imagine if we got a live action version of that? So awesome... </TEXT>

So yeah, I still regard it as an incomplete movie. 

Also, why didn't batman just throw a batarang at the end there to disarm 2face... it's like his iconic weapon, the very thing used when crooks are holding guns. 

But yeah don't even go there. I don't even acknowledge tdkr as the same series as BB and TDK. </TEXT>

Or at least it would have if days of future past hadn't killed off almost the entire first class team, and also any good that movie brought back to the stagnating movie franchise...

Anyway I always thought this movie is what started Tom Cruise's revitalization in awesome movie roles again, because in the 2000s he faced some popularity backlash (and the scientology thing didn't help) but since then the 2010s have seen him be in some great films and he himself showed how great he was in them.

Ideally I'd like more creampie and more tongue kissing. If you're gonna do porn, you might as well have lots of creampies and kissing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What are you even talking about. Throughout the series both the books and characters acknowledge that there's a darkness to Cassie, a darkness very much different from Rachel's wild side. 

Remember it was Cassie's idea to trap David as a nothlit rat for all eternity, a fate commonly agreed upon to be worse than death, and there were other times Cassie displayed ruthlessness that was specifically contrasted with her type of personality. It's the whole point of the books.  </TEXT>

I identified a lot with Tobias and always thought about what it would be like to fly away and be a hawk. His whole entire arc was about how he was slowly distancing himself from humanity, living like a predator, through the rules of nature etc. I could identify with that, as I was similar to Tobias as a kid. 

I was glad when the the ellimist have him morphing powers again though and he was no longer a nothlit </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know right? Sometimes I forget that they were barely teenagers when the series began, and were still teenagers by the end of the war. They acted so much older than their age, considerably so in hindsight, and that's not even counting the loss of innocence from basically being... well it's kinda like child soldiers isn't it? Especially when they recruit the disabled kids at the hospital, I mean boy that was.... that was dark, especially their rationale behind it. 

Yeah the series is a lot darker when you think about it. 

I liked Megamorphs as well, and I enjoyed the one with them going back in time with the dinosaurs, though I think Elfangor's Secret might be my favorite? Actually I can't remember why the book was even called that, it had nothing to do with Elfangor did it? His only secret being he was actually the dad of Tobias? Also now that I think about it were **all** the Megamorphs books involving time travel? Huh. </TEXT>

You know what's unfortunate though? I never got a chance to read Visser back during the height of my Animorphs fandom. I just never found the book.

<TEXT> Neither. A game is only counted when the developers themselves actually announce it, and Atlus aren't showy developers, they only recently announced it. 

Although, some did speculate back when Catherine came out that it was clearly to test the engine (at least graphically) for persona 5. Anyway can't wait for the game, and also can't believe they made a ps4 port instead of focusing on just the ps3, like how p4 was ps2 only and not simultaneously released on ps3. Ah well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a rule of thumb, the longer a game goes through development hell, and the longer the delays are, the worse the final product ends up being, either actuarial or simply from hype-to-expectation letdown (which of course isn't really a fault of the game itself)

I mean the most famous example is duke nukem forever, but there have been several others. 

However RE 4 went through around 6 years of development time (and this was early 2000s, so inflation of development time in mind this would be like 12 years with today's expensive technology and subsequent long development times) and got scrapped several times, with one of the scrapped designs actually ending up being a whole new game (Devil May Cry) which I definitely think is downright unheard of and unique in the video game industry. 

Just wondering what other game took a really long time (let's say, 5+ years minimum?) but still ended up good. I think I recall one of the marios like super mario galaxy but can't be sure? </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the weirdest movies. It's a sequel to Desperado, the 3rd in Robert Rodriguez's el mariachi trilogy. I dunno, something about the movie has a real surreal vibe throughout. 

In particular is the scene with Johnny Depp and eva Mendes where she scoops his eyes out (what in the actual fuck) and he has empty eye sockets the rest of the movie, and instead of going "what the fuuuuuck?????!!!" like the audience is going, he just sorta goes with it, puts on a pair of sunglasses, and moves along with the plot. 

It's just so... not normal reaction to having your eyes scooped out and going blind. 

That's the part of the movie that always makes me absolutely bewildered.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I became crazy about mcu right around the time of watching agents of shield. Loved it from the very first episode, had a very whedon esque buffy scooby doo gang vibe to it, then the hydra twist happened and everything got flipped/turned upside down. 

Then season 2 happened and it was by far the greatest thing on television of that year. I mean agents of shield season 2 was just immaculate. The finale of that year had me on the edge of my seat moreso than the entirety of avengers 2's disappointing mess, that's how much I loved agents of shield season 2, with skye and the inhumans and discovering her parentage and tying those particular plot threads from season 1, that hit really close to home for me. 

Season 3 couldn't (and didn't) follow up on the amazingness that was season 2, but I just hate the fact that season 4 might be the show's last, because more people are tuning in to watch CW's teenage fest superhero shows than agents of shield and netflix's mcu shows. 

Oh well. I enjoy agents of shield, enjoyed agent carter (shame it got canceled) and am going through luke cage now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> And see, *that's* how I thought they were going to make the ninja and punisher plot line intersect. By having punisher just shoot them all, since I was expecting the show to go the subversion route with mystical ninjas since they seemed to be building that up with daredevil questioning stick's "fortune cookie nonsense" so having it end with punisher showing you can take these so called magic cult dudes with regular bullets would shatter the illusion of this magic war. 

But I guess they didn't go that route, they played it straight instead of subversion.  </TEXT>

Because I  was so sure that was how they were going to introduce the Punisher (costume and all), by having him take out like the entire gang in an anti-climactic way where daredevil and Elektra are just stunned by how easy it was, in a classic nod to when Indiana Jones took out the guy with a sword with just one shot. 

Instead he shows up after most were already taken out and 4 remained? Less of an epic intro to punisher's intro.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here's a guy with such a selective choice of movies that he only does a couple every decade, and has now won 3 oscars, securing the most out of any actor in history.

9 is not a bad movie per se, it's just... eh, you know? A cliche riddled meh movie that DDL had decided to star in, and in the movie itself has Marion Cotillard as a wife but decides to cheat with Penlope Cruz? Over Marion Cotillard? Absolutely absurd.

I've always wondered why he chose that, when in the past the kind of movies he's chosen were My Left Foot, Last of the Mohicans, Gangs of New York, and Lincoln. Nine seems like an odd misstep (again not a bad movie but... considering DDL's picky tastes, what made him choose this over other roles)

The movie is a musical and I guess it's alright, the songs are kinda catchy and I guess that's all that matters, I'm assuming he chose the role because he wanted to try his hand at singing. But otherwise it's a very uninteresting movie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh that's a whole nother issue with American mainstream porn (which I incidentally don't watch, for so many reasons) in that it's so sterile and just non-erotic. There's never any kissing, any actual touching, communication (besides the oh so boner killing generic statements like "oh yeah oh fuck oh fuck" which make me go flaccid instantly because they're just so stupid) between the partners over what they like, what they enjoy, and communication, actual sensuality is more of a turn-on for me than the Ikea-esque porn of a guy just shoving his dick in and out of a girl. I prefer actual communication, like a girl telling the guy to rub her there, or in the heat of the moment telling him to bite her, or just actual back and forth, like the guy saying how much he enjoys being with her and how great it feels with her. Anything in that range. 

What I like from European porn or X-Art/Joymii/Sexart is when the partners are actually caressing each other, kissing a lot (which is my favorite thing) and slowly go from foreplay to intense passion, there's an actual buildup to it instead of disgusting mainstream American porn where the guy slaps his dick on the girl's face. Who finds that sexy? I know I don't. Oh also the guys in X-Art/Joymii etc are usually very handsome, fit, have six packs and just a nice physique, which I have to say is a welcome change from the fat hairy Ron Jeremy types of American porn hehe :P.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never got that, if anything most mainstream porn, especially American porn (but all the other ones as well) is incredibly homoerotic, and I never could understand how guys masterbate to that. It's like half the video is devoted to seeing a guy jerk into a girl's mouth ie blowjob, and I sit there thinking is the majority of American men really into watching another dude masturbate while a girl's face is in the background? I would much rather see a video of the girl getting off, rather than the guy. As a matter of fact most porn is TOO male centric and not enough focus on the woman. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok I don't understand some of the people saying the Luke thing is cringe, it was hilarious for an older lady to be "going after" a young man, total sitcom material, A+ ! I mean sure they're kinda out of stories it seems for Luke. Hell they seem to not know what to do with Alex either; after another user stated how she just enters a scene to yell and then leave, I can't stop seeing it, with her just getting angry in every scene and literally scowling in the background, like that's all she's doing now, scowling as if that's her entire character. 

But I digress, I otherwise thought the episode like all of them was okay. 

What actually bothers me though, is Rainer's daughter. Are they seriously going to have us suspend our disbelief enough and pretend that this 6 foot tall, clearly 19+ year old girl  is 14? Come on son. That's bottom tier quality for an ABC show like Modern Family.


But otherwise, I don't get all the "creepy" posts, do some even know what it means? Also comedy is always about pushing boundaries into the uncomfortable zone, that's what makes things funny.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> As someone from the stifling, freedom restricting Arab World, it's always HILARIOUS when they try to localize TV shows like The Simpsons and Modern Family. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In case you are unaware, this region of the world is predominantly Muslim so things like alcohol and premarital sex are not just taboo, but also grounds for capital punishment (extreme I know)

So for example, when they tried to localize something like The Simpsons, instead of beer, Homer's signature drink, they had him drink Pepsi, which is hilarious. Obviously it was heavily criticized and the show flopped because of the changes.

An even more hilarious one is Modern Family, which prominently features a homosexual couple, who have adopted a baby and are living together and everything. Now I need not state the prejudice that same sex couples might encounter in the West, but in Arabia they outright do not stand for it, and it's punished by physical violence, either torture or capital punishment. So when they tried to localize Modern Family, they either cut out most of Cam and Mitch's scenes, or edited them greatly, so a normally 20 minute show becomes what, 14 or 15 minute?

Just thought I'd share some of the frustratingly facepalming moments of this region and hope to garner some solidarity about how annoying it can be living in such a restrictive region of the world. You kind of have to be here to fully grasp some of the situation's stupidities, but nevertheless I just thought I'd show what life is like from the television medium aspect.  </TEXT>

As for dialogue, I don't really know what Macbeth is like to compare it to, but it's Shakespeare. The lines are lifted verbatim from the play.

But then Coach left and it was back to one...

Same thing with Agents of Shield. First we had Trip join the agents and it was cool, and then the season after we got Mac, and it was like whoah! Two black characters on a show instead of just one token cast member, that's great! 

Up until... well you know. And there are many times that tv and movies have parodied the token minority character thing, like in that "not another teen movie" scene which always cracked me.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> They're not funny, they definitely don't appeal to an international audience (ie people like me) and they just make the show seem dated many years from now, so the unfunny jokes become more cringey in just a few years' time. 

For example, I love 30 Rock; its first 3 seasons are absolutely comedy gold, some of the best comedy on TV. However they wasted almost the entirety of their final season, season 7 (which was already only half a season with 12 episodes instead of the standard 20-24 episodes) on the stupid american political debate thing with... whoever the hell was running against Obama back in 2012 (I mean I don't even remember, that's how dated it is) and it just seems like a terrible idea to waste the final season of the show on a political debate that literally no one would remember after the fact. 

And I was recently watching a New Girl episode that featured this recent election with the 2 horrible candidates and it was, if possible, even worse than the 5-6 episodes of 30 Rock that were devoted to the politics. 

There are probably more examples but these are the 2 that come to mind in recent memory. What are your thoughts on election/political type episodes? Especially if they're heavy handed in an otherwise comedy show? </TEXT>

No one ever mentions this in discussions, why? I thought he was really good looking, always wondered why he didn't return for shoemaker's other batman movie.

In Batman Forever I actually thought he was really good in maintaining a dark side especially when they delved into the whole psychology of Bruce Wayne and that speech he gave to Robin about revenge was also really good.

- R rated superhero movie

- Obscure comic book character that only internet nerds know about

- Released in **February**

- *Actually good*

I mean... it had all this stuff going against it, and yet it pulled so much money at the box office, like insane numbers on the budget it had.

Is it thanks to girls that the movie made so much money, that it released on valentine's day so had a lot of the female audience going to see it? If you'll recall the female audience is usually where the money is, eg twilight and frozen and 50 shades of grey. Could that account for how it made so much money? 

I mean who would have ever thought we'd ever get such an amazing Deadpool movie, or even a Deadpool movie at all, in this timeline. We need to harness this power and use it for future movies of obscure comic book characters and less mainstream characters that are not batman/superman/spiderman (ie the big 3)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did anyone else totally get a Scar from the Lion King vibe from him, especially with his whole manipulating of the apes clan and Caesar's son?

And anyone else find Koba's demise in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes really ironic?

In Rise, Jacobs is hanging for his life in a crashed helicopter, and Koba mercilessly pushes it over the edge. 

In Dawn, Koba is hanging for his life on the tower edge. Caesar doesn't help him and lets him fall.

Looks like karma came to bite him in the ass. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Barbershop: The Next Cut was rather topical wasn't it? Preachy too. But very good movie, and possibly needed to be. Spoilers </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-28 22:25:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I especially don't get agree with most of the things the characters are saying regarding attraction and saying things like "this is what ALL men want" and "this is what ALL women like"

Otherwise I think I kind of like it. It's weirdly a lot more heartfelt than I would expect from Ice Cube and a sequel that's a whopping 14 years after the original. Enjoyed seeing characters like Eve  keeping it tight for a 14 year age different since Barbershop 1. And while I really don't like that singer niki minaj with her incredibly plastic appearance, I found her character here surprisingly funny in that "person you want to hate" kinda way.

Rest of the cast is shaping up nicely. Common is keeping it real. Winston from New Girl is a fantastic addition. The kid actors are... passable. There presence serves its purpose in the message the movie is trying to send and I like it too. 

All in all I'm surprised it's nearly 2 hours, it feels much shorter since it's such a seemingly simple plot that has a lot of heart thanks to the performances and the character interactions. Almost just like the first in that way isn't it. 

Really didn't expect it to be as good as it was.

A lot, like Schmidt from New Girl, have the trope of creating an air of mystery over what the character's "real name" or first name actually is.

What's really weird is that on Scrubs, Carla calls her husband by his last name, Turk. I mean maybe I could understand JD calling him Turk, but it just sounds weird for the wife to address her husband by his last name instead of first. </TEXT>

<TITLE> For the first time in my life I think I'm actually considering the whole "build your own pc" concept. Or at the very least... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-28 22:19:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  maybe try to find one of those places that build the pc for you but with all the best parts and the most rams, I have no problem paying extra.

This prebuilt all in one desktop pc that I bought last year... it's a piece of crap. Straight out of the box it was giving me blue screens of death. I took care of that eventually, but it still has always had terrible specs, is rather laggy, can't handle a bunch of programs open at once, and just really makes me regret spending so much on it.

Games are not really important, I just for once want a pc that has a very high processing power, can handle several tabs especially youtube videos and etc, adobe acrobat and reader, my email, and can do a comprehensive scan to boot. Basically the works. 

I wouldn't want to buy another prebuilt pc since they all come with Windows 10 now. I mean 8.1 is no picnic but I think I'd be comfortable with it since I'm mostly used to the OS for better or worse. 

Is there a specific website people go to for pc building? A shopping site that puts parts all together? An actual brick and mortar store that you go to where they'll just assemble the parts together for you? 

And is it just the desktop that people build when talking about pc building, while they buy any monitor or do pc gamer build the monitor too? Just wonder since All-in-one PCs don't seem to be the lifesaver I thought they would be in saving me space on my desk.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As is a common staple of sitcoms, cartoon or live action in America, the morbidly obese fat guy seems to always have a stellar hot wife who would never actually be with this slob in real life as JD's Scrubs would put it. 

Now in this case I think she may have been pregnant and just gained a little bit of weight so it's not exactly the same thing, but near the end of King of Queens run I happened to catch an episode of one of the later seasons and was shocked at how big Carrie became. It almost seemed like her husband's bad eating habits and diet had started to affect her so she was just as big as Kevin James was. Almost seemed like the effect of a bad influence (Kevin James) on a person, can't explain why I felt that way when I was younger but that's what it felt like.  </TEXT>

For example, he goes diving in a children's ballpit area and really immerses himself in it. Um gross?

And yet Sheldon dives into one? Yeah right. Dude throws away his entire food container if someone takes out like one fry.

Then there's the time he literally got naked in the college campus parking lot and sat in Howard's car, like completely naked and in another person's car. The dude who has a specific spot on the couch to sit in and won't allow any compromise of the location. 

It just doesn't make any sense, and that kind of inconsistency is jarring. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disney gave up after the second one hehe and gave the franchise to Fox for the 3rd one. 

Thing is, I kinda liked some scenes in the first 2 movies. I especially thought Prince Caspian had a ton of potential to be what disney were trying to market as "epic" and there were particularly scenes that I thought were great, particularly the cameo of the Witch. 

I think they were held back by being like, pg rated or something, especially prince Caspian which had a lot more adult themes of betrayal and bloodshed. I mean you can't have a pg war, it just doesn't work. So disney at the time didn't realize they couldn't have it both ways, be for children and dark/epic for adults at the same time. 

But I liked the first 2 for the most part. I did happen to catch the 3rd one a few months ago... wasn't a fan.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-11-20 08:58:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are so many things about Skyfall I disliked, from the sudden jump in time where Bond who *just* got his 00 license is now apparently too old, abandoning the plot/secret organization that Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace (which everyone hates but I felt was a good resolution to the vesper storyline, one of the best aspects of the reboot) set up, and a joker ripoff of a villain who totally copies the "planned to get caught" nonsense again and didn't pull it off nearly as well. Where the hell did the train come from. Oh and I'm not even going to get into that home alone finale. The fact that this movie made a billion dollars is just... I mean with **that** finale... I just can't even. 

Then we have DoFP. Oh boy I don't even know where to start with this movie, we'll be here forever. Remember when we were getting tired of Wolverine being center stage for every single xmen movie, to the point where they literally made a show called wolverine and the xmen? Yeah I now miss that, because anything is better than the mystique show. Christ not only is jlaw a terrible actress (at least Hugh Jackman is a great one and really made wolverine work) but their extreme focus on her inconsistent character is just completely misguided. It's what brought down first class, which was an amazing return to form and a shame they killed off all the characters there off screen (really, the powerful emma is killed off? How does that work exactly). I mean I could criticize every aspect of this movie (besides the rather cool quicksilver scene which singer literally just did again for Apocalypse) but let's just say that I would have much rather just watched an entire movie with the future segments and how all these cool new xmen with barely any dialogue met up. THAT would have made for a much better movie than this recent decade hopping trend the crappy xmen series has been doing. 

It's just weird how Skyfall and DoFP were praised when they share the exact same flaws their sequels do, and it's as if it took the sequels for people to finally notice the flaws.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I just don't get season 3 Hydra and Malick's motivation for bringing the creature back. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-29 15:51:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What sane person would want to invite this sort of thing back to Earth?  I mean why intentionally bring a bigger fish into your own pond? Did they think it will share its powers with Hydra? That they could control it or use it as a weapon to control the world? With evil beings that's rarely ever the case. Doesn't seem like many if anyone would benefit from it's return besides Hive itself. So you just signed up to make yourself and everyone you know it's bitch, not something a multi-billionaire powerful man would be ready to do, powerful men simply don't become subservient. 

I just felt that entire aspect last season was weak sauce. A multi billionaire couldn't see that this creature will clearly betray him and could eat him alive? Literally!

Another thing I don't get, why does Hive say he needs a Malick by his side? After killing Gideon's daughter he just up and kills Gideon the next episode. May as well have killed Gideon then before Gideon seemingly destroyed all Hydra operations out of revenge.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought nick cannon was a weird choice to use for rosa's boyfriend since bnn is a fantastic show that's way out of his league acting wise. 

But then Adrian Pimento comes along and I recognize him from parks and rec so that made me smile. Then the whole silly flirtation thing with him and Rosa Diaz made me laugh. 

But then... in the next episode rosa wants to marry him? That was... kinda fast. Even in the context of a few months, that did seem wildly out of character. 

Also this: "You guys, I can't *wait* to spend my life with Adrian Pimento."

That statement alone, I couldn't help feeling that came out of left field from rosa's mouth. Didn't she break up with nick cannon because she wasn't sure if she was ready for that kinda next step?

I dunno. I do like that actor from his parks and rec role, but I can't help feeling this whole romance was rather rushed. So I didn't feel *as* invested as I could have in the whole attempted assassination and him having to leave and/or written out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess since I come from a somewhat more collectivist society than an American/western one that celebrates individualism, we don't really have what the west has with old people being alone and/or put in homes, since it's a very family oriented society. 

I *can* understand everyone you've ever known dying and you being the only one left, but still... old curmudgeony man that's literally the "get off my lawn!" stereotype of cartoons and such? Very poor compared to an idea as wonderfully original as say, Ratatouille.  </TEXT>

Also you can always adopt, there's more to being parents than just dna, and lastly the whole fat kid looking for a father figure... again, it was rather cliche and just boring, a very big step down from the previous movie's huge emotional appeal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dunno, Up was too cloying to have given much of an emotional impact, especially with the intro sequence in the beginning being too on the nose sad for me to care. Not like say, the opening of finding Nemo which actually provides good reason for why Marlin is so overprotective of Nemo and handled much better. 

I won't even get into Toy Story 3, an unnecessary movie that basically copies a lot of elements of Toy Story 2 (toying with the idea of them no longer being played by andy, a villain pretending to be nice but was the villain this whole time manipulating his underlings, etc etc) and never needed to be made because Toy Story 2 ended the series so perfectly "whatever happens, as long as I've got you buzz we'll face it together, to infinity and beyond"

I dunno. For me, there's a difference between a movie being emotionally strong and a movie that's desperately trying to emotionally manipulate me. Pixar's post 2008 works were entirely the latter.  </TEXT>

She goes from being a bit like those CW show characters you like so much, having drama with her boyfriend from the rising tide, stuff like that, and the you see her develop as part of a team in season 1. Then in season 2 when "what they become" happens... my god, it's just so good. I get goosebumps just thinking about it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look if you like these poor quality shows there's nothing wrong with that, as these shows are aimed at a certain demographic of people. Cw shows are for teenagers and 20somethings still in college. Same with Gotham, they have a very specific target demographic, and there's nothing wrong if you like these low quality shows; I myself used to watch Smallville when I was a teenager, and actually love it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but I have fond memories of watching this show with friends and family. I assume it's the same with cw's arrow, it's simply for a specific teenage or early 20something audience that's all.
But for quality? You go to agents of shield/carter, or Netflix's amazing daredevil and Jessica jones. Basically anything mcu. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is, I'm not attracted to blond cheerleader types either, like for example margot robbie and her extremely masculine face with that sharp jaw. In fact it's why I actually liked bobbi when she was undercover in hydra and had extremely dark hair, which made her look so sexy, but then the next episode she goes light blonde and I was so surprised and a little disappointed. 

But the thing is, attractive people are attractive even with a blonde hair color and it's her face that I am attracted to (for women I don't care about the body, it's only ever the face that I look at and care about) and she has a wonderful face with soft round features instead of a manly pronounced jaw like Jessica Chastain. 

But Hunter on the other hand... well he has a bit of a dog face __ . I still like him as a character though don't get me wrong! I like him for his flaws and his heroic moments, all of them.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I remember seeing this movie when I was young a very long time ago, and I've been dying to try to find it, but I barely remember anything about it except for a few scenes in a hazy memory. 

From what I call here's how the movie starts out, a guy who already has a girlfriend is driving his car in the rain and sees a woman in the rain and gives her a ride. To thank him she starts indicating that she wants to have sex with him and while he resists at first, he succumbs and stops the car to have sex with her.

This is what leads to him and his girlfriend breaking up because she somehow finds out. So the rest of the movie is him trying to get her back.

That's all I remember from the beginning, the only other scene I remember is fast forwarding later in the movie, where the guy and his two friends, and the girlfriend and her 2 friends happen to be at a club. One of the girl's friends is a shy introvert but after having some alcohol in her she dances for all the guys in the club and strips down to her bra and underwear which are both red, then points to one of the guys from the crowd to take her and he carries her away. 

Then the last female  friend has a fling with one of the guy's male friends in a bathroom stall, and she's like "say something in french" and he says "escargot" and that's pretty much all I remember from the movie. 

It was or seemed very low budget from what I remember, no popular actors or actresses, just really C-tier people. But I just want to remember what it was. Since I saw it on TV there is the possibility that it was just a TV movie and not even a real theater release... so I have my expectations of ever finding the title of this movie to be very low indeed.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> WHY are producers so desperate to get Craig back as Bond? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-08 14:33:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Do they really think the billion dollar success of the past 2 movies was because of Daniel Craig? It's not. The fact of the matter is in the 10 years since the immaculate Casino Royale's release, so much has changed in the market:

New markets like China and India have opened up.

Social media has completely changed everything, increasing the presence of movies like never before. 

A billion more people on the planet than before. 

And more. All these factors are what contribute to the bond movies doubling their gross since before prior to the huge boost of mainstream internet, social media, new markets, etc etc 

Their desperation in wanting Craig back, going so far as to reportedly pay him 100 million for the role, is nothing short of silly. Anyone in the role of bond will garner the same billion dollar gross because of the reasons thus posted. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thoughts on Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet? Some questions. Spoilers </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-01 09:15:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've unfortunately never read the tragedy of Hamlet (would have loved to read it in school) but I did just see 1996's Hamlet. I liked it. 

Very powerful performances, but also depressing because everyone dies. I think this is the work of Shakespeare well known for exemplifying his stories where everyone dies at the end right?

I also picked up on so many lines, quotes and scenes that many media have used, which all came from Hamlet. 

I was wondering just how close this is to the actual play. I hear it's totally unabridged and word for word from the play, is this true? Is seeing it pretty much like having read the play?

I wanted to discuss the many themes and motifs of the story. For one thing I was actually wondering whether Hamlet really was crazy and whether his uncle really did kill his father. As such, I was confused by whether some scenes really happened or were a figment of the imagination, like a scene where the uncle is inside a church confession stall and confesses his sin of killing his brother the king, and Hamlet is on the other side ready to kill him with a dagger but stays his hand for some reason (I didn't *quite* understand the reason why)

And poor Ophelia. Shakespeare's women tend to get such the worst brunt of it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've actually wondered why the real mad eye moody wasn't the dada teacher in book 5. 

I remember after finishing book 4 I was thinking "finally the curse of the defense against the dark arts teacher position has been lifted" and that now we know in advance who is going to be filling the position, since they found the real madeye in his trunk and he can now complete that favor to dumbledore of teaching the kids for a year. 

But instead book 5 came out and gave us the unequivocally awful umbridge. 

I remember wondering how come madeye didn't teach that year since when I was younger that's who I assumed they were going with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To me Dawn was great. But it also had such a melancholic feel to it (intentional of course) because you know that James franco's character is dead, his father is dead, everyone you loved from the first film, they're all dead now. Which hurts really hard.

But the movie is so damn great and it's amazing just how great the sequel is despite being so tonally different from the first one. 

Probably because the tone carries Lion King and reverse Tarzan esque motifs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't even care about some of the more unrealistic things that would never happen in a science lab like not knowing a chimp was pregnant or not being quarantined immediately after being exposed to chemicals in testing phase, because the movie's heart and soul is in James franco's performance. Amazing. 

Then there's the criminally underappreciated Andy serkis who deserved *some*  kinda award nomination and recognition for bringing to life one of the most sympathetic non human characters of all time. 

And of course there's John Lithgow's heartwrenching performance. It's just an amazing movie all around. I feel like the only one who's as hugely into the movies as I am, having been utterly blown away by Rises when I watched it 5 years ago. 

Movie came outta nowhere. I saw no news about the development of the movie prior to its release and box office trailer. And it was amazing. 

It's honestly the least talked about amazing solid franchise in wake of all the comic book movies and scifi stuff. </TEXT>

I've been doing it ever since I was a kid, daydreaming about how if I had done so and so, then I could probably be fit and good looking and have a ton of friends and people who want to be with me. Then as an adult I daydream about that one defining moment in my life and how if I had never say broken my leg and gotten suicidally depressed, I could have had the perfect (if a bit romanticized) life of friends, girls, a career in mind, essentially a life. 

It's the only thing I do, 18 hours a day. Then of course when sleep comes my subconscious delves into just horrible things, either relieving the past or worse painting the "ideal" life I had always built up.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To be incredibly bitter, towards everyone. To be envious. To be so lonely that you just resent everyone, and filled with so much self-hatred that you just deflect it onto others.

Like saying other people don't deserve or don't get to be depressed like you, because they're good looking, or thin/healthy bodied, or simply living in a society where the people speak the same language as them instead of being a fish out of water (a feeling I'd been intimately familiar with my entire life) where you have no hope of ever even being able to *communicate* with someone. 

And then just end up sighing at all these stupid thoughts you have. Feeling guilty because there are people "worse off" than you, so why should you feel depressed right? It's difficult when you live in a society like the middle east where social acceptance of psychological problems isn't really common compared to the Western world like America. To come from a more Western background but live in a place like this where... sigh

I'm sitting alone in a room right now completely in the dark except for the bright light of this computer  monitor, and I have that realization that I do every so often the past 7 years. I'm alone, I'm truly alone. I have no friends, I have no life. There is truly nothing for me. Worst still, I've lost my youth. The golden years of making friends in your 20s, of having a real college experience, of coming out of your shell and putting behind the bullying and loseriness of school to be someone else, I lost that, hell I never got the chance to truly achieve it. 

What really bothers me most is that very thing, losing your youth. Because your youth, your health, I mean once you lose that... then there truly is nothing left. And it's not a case of feeling suicidal or anything like that, it's more the fact that... there is nothing for me in the foreseeable future. You hear about people having midlife crises and whatnot, but I can't even imagine reflecting on an empty life when I turn 50 or 60 or if I tragically live that long, feeling unhappy as I am. Unfulfilled. Alone. Feeling pathetic. 

All I'd ever wanted is just friends, people to talk to. Like-minded people, otherwise. Talk about anything, from popular culture items like books, movies, video games, television shows, to sciences, language, politics of countries, the human experience, all of it. 

I hate this elongated phase of my depression, this embittered phase, especially as I live in a society of tough love speeches and redundant or even tautological rhetoric such as "if you're unhappy, be happy, problem solved!" and "you don't have any friends? Make friends, what's so hard? The best way to get friends is to make friends." 

I dunno. Just felt like I needed to vent and be heard on a friday night when everyone else is out enjoying the evening, and I'm stuck here constantly obsessing over where and how I "went wrong" in life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't how many people here have even seen this cut but I just did. I'd only ever caught this movie on TV and for sure it must have been the worst/shortest version, the 130 minute cut. 

Hell even at 251 minutes, this movie still feels rather... disjointed. Wikipedia stated that Sergio Leone wanted to make 2 movies at 3 hours each, so I wonder what that version would have been like. 

I dunno, the movie feels all over the place and unfocused, especially when they add in digitally restored scenes never seen before, like a scene with a Jewish chauffeur talking to De Niro's character about how there's no need to be a gangster "like the Italians" in his words, so with stuff like that I can't even gauge what the movie wants to be. I kind of prefer Once Upon a Time in the West more as well as For a Few Dollars More out of Leone's work. 

But there's so much history with this movie, all the cuts it went through, what the studio told Leone to do and not do,  I feel it's prudent to see.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just finished this movie and feel oddly depressed. 

I mean yeah most of the characters are portrayed as complete "preppy" (their words) tools of a seemingly dying yuppie culture, and I found the redhaired guy particularly annoying in his egotistical idiocy and beliefs, but at the end of the movie when all the girls have moved on and the 3 guys have a depressing night out by themselves... I dunno that kind of rejection is very familiar to me on a personal level and I felt really depressed even if I didn't necessarily like these characters.  

Also the exiting of the nick character (chris eigeman) earlier in the movie is a shame since he was the best part of the movie, as he plays a more likable abrasive character in comparison to his character in the last days of disco.

I dunno why I feel so depressed at the ending but I just do. 3 of the guys from the "Sally Fowler rat pack" go from each girl's house to the next and are asked to leave as these girls have their own dates to go to and Sally herself even calls these guys "tiresome"

I mean it's true that the philosophical debates they have can seem tiresome but to have the girl outright say it to their face like that... I dunno, for some reason that really stung to me as a viewer.  </TEXT>

I for one enjoy cristin miloti a lot more (even though the movie tries its hardest to make her look ugly by giving her a horrible, horrible hair style) than margot robbie who basically just looks like a young jamie presley, or a combination of presley and denise richards.

<TEXT> I liked it a lot. 

What makes it so surreal is that I completely wasn't expecting it to be that way, especially with how it opens, and this is completely different from any of the martin scorsese movies I've watched. I was starring bug eyed at the screen a couple of times throughout the protagonist's series of misadventures, but by the end I was just going "what the fuck???"

I was especially terrified when he was stuck inside the paper mache caste of a not too subtle throwback to the scream statue from before. I kept thinking "oh please god don't let the movie end with him trapped there forever until he literally dies like that" but then he broke out and I was sighing in relief to much to even appreciate how hilarious that ending scene was where he just walks into the office all covered in dust and soot from a long long horrible night. 

I mean... the movie is unlike anything I've seen from the director, certainly wasn't expecting it. Great stuff though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't want to mention too many specific examples, and I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder and everyone has their own tastes, but for example I remember watching The Truth About Cats and Dogs and quite frankly, even as a kid I'd watch this movie and feel annoyed that I was supposed to think Uma Thurman was the "more attractive beauty" and Janeane Garofalo wasn't, when Janeane is easily more my type than Uma, who has that Northern European look of blond hair, pointy nose, tall, etc that I'm extremely NOT a fan of. 

That's just one example but I've got several. And I don't know why it bothers me so much but it just does. I dislike a movie trying to convey to me what they think stereotypical attractive elements are in their eyes. 

I mean all people are lovely in their own way, and I wouldn't want to take away another person's loveliness by saying they're not attractive, that's not my aim here. It's just that I'm bothered when movies try to display a particular woman or type as more attractive. And of course, unfair as it may be, when you consider that Hollywood and the west is responsible for a majority of cinema, the beauty that's being idolized is typically Aryan in nature, with the whole blonde, white, tall, pointy nosed, possibly blue eyed thing.  Which not everybody subscribes to.  </TEXT>

It handled stuff like Venom and Sandman so well. Sandman especially I thought was handled perfectly after the disaster that was Raimi's Spiderman 3. This Sandman was actually sympathetic in that one episode of his (those that watched the show will know the episode I'm talking about)
Josh Keaton is such a perfect spiderman, that's how you do quips right, he was so likable. Heh I remember when Young Justice got him to voice a spiderman ripoff designed villain. That was a nice homage.
I remember the first time I saw the art style I felt it was a little weird looking, but later I got used to it and didn't care because the characters and story were so good.
Later on, it proved to be amazing in terms of doing action scenes, so while the art style is different, that sinister 6 fight scene is probably one of the greatest scenes in animation of all time, which just adds to the shame of so few knowing about this show.
Breaks my heart we never got more episodes, I can only imagine where they'd take the story and characters, although I guess at the same time I'm glad that we never had to deal with Gwen dying because I don't know if I could handle that, she was a real character in this series, a real actual incredibly likable character, having the green goblin kill her would just be...

And I think Gilmore Girls is an important show for anyone to watch to see the relationships unfold between so many people, either mother and child (Lorelai's relationship with her mother paralleled my own, while Lorelai's relationship with her daughter was something I always wished for and idealized/wanted) or between friends, rivals, and so forth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I think I told you in the other topic to disregard what that person said. 

At any rate, JD and elliot were together before the s8 finale... although yeah, that was one of the great parts of the show. I was so excited for every part with the original cast members, but absolutely loathe the focus on some of the new interns, some that are worse than others. On rewatches I straight up skip their part. 

When you consider the fact that they didn't even use them for the spin off show, it means that they basically forced them into season 8, wasted valuable minutes of an already short 20 minute show, and with no payoff whatsoever. It's more frustrating than the actual existence of that spin off show.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Made by the same director behind The Last Days of Disco, it has a similar mumblecore type vibe to it where you really get to know what feels like real characters which at the same time are completely outlandish and hilarious in their, for lack of a better word, arrogance. Greta Gerwig (Mistress America, Frances Ha) is amazing in this, you just crack up at everything she says, and she's one of my favorite "little known" actresses since she mostly does these kind of roles instead of big budget Hollywood stuff.
I don't even want to spoil the movie, I just want to say that it's mostly a look at the relationships and dynamics between people, set in a college campus where newcomer Analeigh Tipton (who is unbelievably cute, almost unbearably so with her soft voice and wide doe eyes) transfers to this school and is immediately spotted by a group of girls that run a suicide (prevention) center. From there on you'll just have to see how the dynamics unfold within the movie.
All the movies I mentioned in this topic are also great, but I chose to single out Damsels in Distress just because it's one of those movies where you rewatch it just to see things you miss the first time, like the expressions and faces that all the actors make at something Greta Gerwig's character says, or the fact that said "damsels" in the movie are so lovely your eyes keep darting from one to the other to take it all in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really like this movie and its pairing of JGL and scarjo. This was the role she was born to play, an unbelievably gorgeous, out of this world woman, I could totally get don jon's obsession with her in the beginning. 

One of my favorite scenes is the hallway scene where you realize how she is skilled at manipulating a guy to control him since that's what she wants, I thought that was a really well done scene and probably the only time an incredibly arousing scene in a movie actually furthered the story and character development instead of just providing titillation (which as don jon so truthfully stated, could be gotten from pornographic content much more easily)

And the shattered expectations of don jon as he realizes that being super gorgeous isn't exactly the greatest foundation of a relationship on, in addition to learning about why he engages in his own vices, is something I enjoyed as well. 

All in all, these two actors really knocked it out of the park for this movie and I just can't help loving her role in don jon.  </TEXT>

You know what would have made the ending better? That shoulder-to-shoulder walk presented in popular movies, like say Casablanca's ending with Rick and the chief of police?

I actually would have liked to see that with Dracula and Alucard, all like "come on, son" "alright dad" and doing a sort of walk-and-hug thing side by side as the credits roll.

I mean then at least I could have appreciated the already absurdly silly story by laughing at such a hilarious scene. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Let's discuss Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2. (Series SPOILERS) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-14 21:50:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Checking posts around the internet and the series seems to be disliked immensely, especially the second one. While I love the gba and ds castlevania games based on sotn, a classic, I also found myself growing to like the first LoS, even though I dismissed it back in 2010. But I played it a few years ago and thought it was pretty ok for the most part, gameplay wise at least. Then there was the mirrors of fate game (ps3 version) which was as close to the IGA castlevania games as you could get, so I liked it too.
Finally we have LoS 2.
It's funny, I don't think I've ever played a game where the story was absolutely abysmal but the voice acting was top notch. I mean how does that even happen, the voice acting was fantastic. Robert Carlyle is amazing as Dracula, his voice is just oodles of goodness, I love listening to it. And then there's the rest of the cast like Patrick Stewart, Jason Isaacs, Madden who voice Alucard, they're all great, I love listening to them, but Robert Carlyle most of all. I can't help praising it a lot.
Anyway, it's true there are things in LoS 2 that deserve criticism, like fact that even after you regain your Dracula powers you still have to sneak around those armored enemies with laser canons and can't actually fight them, which seems like a questionable and hilarious design choice. Or just how underwhelming Dracula in modern day happens to be, an interesting premise that's wasted. But despite that I still enjoyed the game, I don't know I just did. As far as 3d beat em ups go in the vein of god of war, this was pretty much as enjoyable as it gets. Dashing with Dracula feels amazing as heck, the powers are fun, changing between blood whip and ice sword that heals you and fire fists that break enemy defenses is enjoyable, and I like that you can level up these just like in other series.
I liked the castle portions because as similarly silly to the main story as they are, I enjoyed going through the castle and actually appreciated the developers painting a history of Dracula/Gabriel, with stuff like his son as the innocent, his wife as his virtue, trying to make him seem all "tragic" and stuff, etc etc. I mean at least they did something, and I kind of liked the idea behind what they went for, especially when the white wolf appears each time.
The ending was absurdly abrupt that left me with a most bemused expression especially when the credits just started rolling but even then, I enjoyed the game so much that I actually got the Alucard dlc and heck enjoyed that too, complaints notwithstanding. </TEXT>

Shame it didn't but nevertheless remains as one of the best movies (especially since the academy awards have never been a guarantee of quality) and one of the ways in which a sequel does things right, by expanding on the foundation that the movie built before it instead of doing retcons.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously it's not necessarily ALL female villains. Nevertheless it's still an existing, old-as-thyme trope. 

Plus considering Maleficent is the only great thing about Sleeping Beauty (which is really more of a story about the 3 fairies vs Maleficent, which is why I like the fairies so much and the story focuses on them more so than the prince and princess), she's more "awesome cool" villain a la Jafar, rather than "terrifying, gave me nightmares as a kid" villain like Ursula did back in the 90s with the little mermaid. 

On that note, the stepmother from Cinderella IS old, is evil terrifying, and can send chills down your spine with simply her cold gaze and icy eyes. The kicker? *She and Maleficent have the same voice actress.*

How's about that for convincing?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Madam Medusa. Ursula. Mother Gothel. Madam Mim.

What do they all have in common? Either fat and/or old women that are absolutely terrifying, use deception, two facedness, and absolute ruthlessness.

I mean yeah sure, Scar, Frollo and Jafar might kill me or torture me and keep me locked away in a dungeon, but that's nothing. With these terrifying female villains, you never know **what** they might do, and that scared me A LOT more as a kid than a guy villain, who I was quite okay with. Mostly because deception and pretending to be someone they're not until "the true form is revealed" always scared the crap out of me and gave me nightmares, which a LOT of these female villains do, like Ursula to look like a human palette swap Ariel, or Mother Gothel to look young, etc etc.

Disney tends to have a trend for this. For example their very first theatrical animated movie, Snow White, had the evil queen who turns herself into an old hag, presumably because there's this rumor that Disney couldn't have an attractive/younger looking woman commit an evil deed like killing, but I don't know if that rumor is true. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the time of learning it back then I had come from a place where traditionally it's older men that marry younger women, and the opposite is completely unheard of. 

I mean it's perhaps not that uncommon worldwide but I finally felt the uncomfortable feeling Carla felt when she realized she was like turk's mom, and that angle coupled with just how much older she is than turk made the whole den mother thing she has make a lot more sense in a literal manner, since she really is that much older than him. 

It's not a big deal since love can blossom from anywhere but I have to admit at the time of putting together this factoid I was very stunned, because it's definitely not common for an older woman to be with a younger man, certainly not 5 to 6 years younger. 

Kinda makes me wonder if she wanted elliot to marry Keith so she wouldn't be the only woman in her circle of friends to marry a younger man hehe.  </TEXT>

Even though I was right, the users there were adamant about disagreeing with me. Hell, even house's infamous "everybody lies" line was said by Dr Kelso first, and yet the quote is attributed to house. I do sometimes get annoyed at the fact that those 2 shows became insanely successful (hell grey's anatomy is still ongoing) while scrubs was constantly in danger of being canceled. Just one of those little injustices in television.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Walt and Gus were bonding in season 3, Walt seems to be enjoying what seems to be an amicable relationship with the big drug dealer this time, and even enjoys cooking with Gale.

So my question is, why wouldn't he want to give up Jesse when Gus wanted him to, why was he so insistent on protecting Jesse, especially considering how evil Walt becomes by the end and even just as recently as poisoning a kid, to be so attached to Jesse. In spite of their constantly strained and rather dysfunctional relationship. 

His strange fascination with wanting Jesse always confused me; instead off him heading for greener pastures with more competent people that have a more evolved vocabulary than just "bitch" he chooses to remain with his old buddy from the beginning of his bad breaking days of cooking meth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pete using terms like "swell" and other old school 'wholesome' type vocabulary.  Meanwhile he's cheating on his gorgeous wife Alison Brie (who even does that) while she's carrying his child, and of course afterwards as well. 

It's a juxtaposition I've always found interesting, because underneath all the ideallic settings of quaint neighborhoods and how-do-you-dos, there's a whole world of... I mean for god's sake, Sally witnessed Roger getting oral sex at a party, that's just awful. 

I always thought the show did that juxtaposition painfully well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like descriptive porn like "your vagina is amazing, I never knew that different women had different... textures, it feels great" or the girl telling him "okay like that, just keep going... yeah let me get on top and rub my clitoris on you... yeah just stay there... you like it, you like the why I grind on your shaft" and just really descriptive instead of silent breathing or worse going "oh fuck oh yeah oh fuck oh god" (that's not sexy, it's just annoying)

Like, actual communication between the two partners is so much hotter than watching 2 professional porn actors have dispassionately sterile sex. Homemade porn however is usually so silent, with just moaning and groaning, but never actual communication which surprises me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi. I really like vanilla or true love stories, does anyone know of any? For example Pretty Cool, I love that one. I even like Peace Hame, weird at it is. Oh also being uncensored is very much preferable, there's rarely a story good enough for me to sit through pixelated genitals or black bars.

My favorite thing about Pretty Cool is how in the heat of the moment he says he's going to get her pregnant and they're going to spend the rest of their lives together, I love stuff like that.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I so hate time skips in tv shows (or really any kind of media) especially of an ongoing story. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-05 08:51:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's one of my most disliked tropes ever. Maybe it's because almost every show that's done the "5 years later" type time skip always ends up worse than when it started out.

They may do it for any number of reasons like they want to be able to update the tv show world with current technology so anachronisms don't appear, like an iphone in 2004.

And I tend to dislike it for a number of reasons, such as the fact that the time they skipped is actually one we the viewers would have loved to see.

Off the top of my head, I can recall simultaneous ABC shows Lost and Desperate Housewives doing a time skip in season 5, and that's when I hated Lost, and that's when I outright dropped watching Desperate Housewives (which I actually used to watch unironically; I actually enjoyed it as far as female centric shows go. It was much better to me than say, sex in the city) </TEXT>

There was nothing in Harry's character that would make him name his own son after snape instead of oh say, just build a memorial in his honor or have his portrait in the headmaster's office.

<DATE> 2016-07-18 14:18:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> That's my main question. 

They spent an inordinate amount of time in season 8 attempting to build up those characters, especially in the beginning of the season. 

Yeah I guess they did bring Denise back (better known as Jane from happy endings, an infinitely better and more likable character) but I thought they were setting up katey to be mini elliot and that one glasses dude to be a more dopey looking (but surprisingly sharper) the todd and Sonny to be a... well actually I dunno, maybe jd? I just liked her because she was cute and sweet, which was refreshing in comparison to the snarky sarcastic riff-raff. 

But most importantly of all, they brought back the famous Jett Jackson! I loved watching that show as a kid, and to see the actor again playing Derek is just perfect. Can't believe we never see him again, instead they replace him with who, the ever annoying Franco brother of James? Or the white dude who looks like the drug addict that tried to scam elliot out of meds. That always bothered me since I thought we were going to see him again if they were doing a spinoff on the interns. 

And all this is IF they were going to do a spinoff at all, since in general the interns are usually better in small bursts, like Lonnie. </TEXT>

I was madly infatuated with Tara Reid as a teenager so seeing her on Scrubs was always a plus, but it drove me absolutely crazy how awful JD was to Danny.

It's probably the only time I've ever truly disliked him, because obsessing over Elliot is well and good but you've got an absolutely gorgeous, stunning young woman right there who wants to be with you. I mean... cripes. Rewatching season 3 always awakens this opinion for me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Have you ever seen someone that looked exactly like how you pictured a character as described in the book? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-07 21:23:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I remember when I was quite young and was reading this book series, anyway in school there was a student a number of grades above me, and they looked exactly like what I had envisioned the character in this book I was reading to look like.

Same thing happened a few years back when I was reading this detective novel, from the "... *In Death*" series. The detective is described as a blond haired woman with hazel nut eyes and whatnot, but I remember seeing an episode of Cold Case and the detective of that show looked *exactly* how I imagined the character to look while reading the books.

It's a weird phenomenon, I don't know how best to explain it but when it does happen, it is noticeable. </TEXT>

<TITLE> It always bothered me that House and Grey's Anatomy copied a lot of Scrubs and yet they ended up being more successful than that amazing show. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-06 11:30:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> House at one point was the most watched tv show in America, and ditto for Grey's Anatomy, a show that's actually still going on if you can believe it, according to Wikipedia. 

Both of these copied Scrubs in terms of having voice overs at the beginning and end of every episode, or having an arrogant jerk of a doctor who is still around the hospital because he's just that good and also has a bit of a god complex, I mean Dr Cox was basically House before that show even aired, complete with an addiction to alcohol as opposed to painkillers for House.

While these 2 shows were pulling great ratings, Scrubs was in danger of being canceled on NBC nearly every season, to the point where at the end it really did end its run on NBC and ABC picked up the show instead, giving fans proper closure to the series as opposed to the terrifying way that season 7 ended. Honestly, just thinking about such injustice keeps me up in the afternoon.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> She's the heart of the group. She's the one who brings Mikoto, Eri, and Akira together. Without her, these 3 wouldn't be as close friends, with there being a clear rivalry between Miko and Eri, both being attractive, successful girls with one being more athletic and into sports while the other being more "princessy" as they say. Which can (and has) lead to friction.

She's I guess the innocent, or the sweet one that everyone likes to protect and take care of. She may not be smart, strong, or have any type of skillset whatsoever, but without her the group can't or doesn't come together. She's essentially the heart and soul of the group.

Now why Harima wants her when he's way out of her league I don't know, but I guess that same kindness she has is what Harima likes. Although it's clear that he idolizes her, and a smarter show that isn't just a huge tease would eventually have an arc making him realize or distinguish the difference between idolizing someone, and actually liking or loving something, and have it be mutual, which is much different than just one way idolizing a person.

Anyway just rewatching the show for the umpteenth time and thought about her role in the series overall, since I used to call her the weakest link, while Harima is (easily) the greatest anime character of all time.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-06-23 15:22:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's a really powerful movie. 

I could barely stomach the first half hour, with it dawning on me what the situation was, her being kidnapped, raped, even beaten, which makes me a combination of sickened and angry beyond belief. 

Then I was literally shaking restlessly in my seat when the son was in the pickup truck and I was like "please please let him find help oh god please please I can't watch please let him escape"

Even though it was just a movie, I was so invested by the situation and it really resonated with me, the feeling of being trapped against one's will, but at the same time absolutely horrified me, and made me so upset. 

It's just a really emotionally draining movie. Especially since the journey doesn't end after they got out. There's still so much to think about. How is she going to live the rest of her life? Will the fact that she was kidnapped and held prisoner for 7 years define her and the rest of her life? Can therapy and support really be enough to live a satisfactory high quality of life? I don't know. 

And the kid. What about him. First off, The child actor in this movie was fantastic, I can't believe the academy didn't give him any sort of recognition. Anyway, as strong as he is, what will it be like when he becomes a teenager, an adult? What about the stigma surrounding his birth? What about the unfortunate implications of what causes someone to be a horrible rapist who traps humans, is it something genetic, will the kid be something like that?

I don't know. The movie just sort of ends but I was left with all these questions, because the situation really got to me. 

What did you think about the movie? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Especially with the "truth bombs" she dropped during the first season's finale and the aftermath of that hurricane. 

It's rather funny when you see an episode of season 4 where she becomes incredibly goofy like the rest of the cast (while still being abrasive in her own way) to how mean and sharp tongued she was when Perry and her were squabbling in any situation during season 1. 

I'd say it's the turning blonde that really mellowed her out. If you'll notice after she becomes blond she becomes incredibly kooky, and a lot less guarded with mean retorts like she was earlier.

Always thought the disparity between the two was interesting, especially as someone who grow up watching The Drew Carey Show and knowing her character from that.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> I've always thought it was weird that Namco decided to release Tales of Symphonia on the ps3, but STILL KEEP Tales of Vesperia on 360 only, at least in America. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-21 23:38:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Not to mention the fact that they actually released a lot more Tales games since 2008, and yet still never did Tales of Vesperia for ps3 in North America. It's like... why not? So strange. They released both Tales of Symphonia *and* its sequel, which were both previously on gamecube and Wii, although Symphonia did get a Japanese only ps2 release. 

It's kind of disheartening, since I fully expected them to release the updated Japanese Tales of Vesperia that they did for ps3 in North America at some point. 

Especially since it felt that way since they ported Eternal Sonata, which was on 360, and I always got the vibe that this was like a fun appetizer to the main course, Tales of Vesperia. 

But it never came. 8 years later and a gen that's now passed, and they never brought it. Despite them releasing other Tales games, hence my confusion. It's just strange, all things considered.  </TEXT>

Why does it give up? What does it take for it to not give up loading all the thumbnails?
Same thing with an imgur gallery featuring entire comics, like more than 50 panels. After a while it needs to reload, and not all the images immediately show up.
Does this have to do with internet speed, the hardware capabilities of the actual computer, or both? </TEXT>

It was a weird quirk that JGL's character doesn't know how to drive, that seems odd. But otherwise, very emotional and heartwarming the whole way through, you really feel for JGL's character.

<TITLE> I finally finished playing the Xenosaga trilogy. I feel they were overly ambitious storywise, but unfortunately fell way short. [SPOILERS, for both it and Xenogears] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-12 12:46:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's a shame, because there were a lot of good ideas here. Gameplay wise I found all of them fine, not without their problems but overall not bad at all, even 2 which had the tedious stocking/casting elemental sword/airing/boosting method of winning battles. 

But I remember when I first played Episode 1, they had a pretty interesting setup with: 

- the gnosis phenomenon

- Shion's character and her traumatic history as well as emotional baggage from Kevin leading into her connection with Kosmos

- Kosmos herself, and all the mysteries surrounding her architecture

- Realians and their rights, as well as prejudice against them as seen by Lieutenant Virgil, which I thought was going to be a larger part of the story since they focused so heavily on it at the beginning (but ultimately... was not)

- Jr (one of my favorite if not favorite character, and a very interesting backstory with URTVs, U-DO, genetic mutation and tampering, etc etc)

- Ziggy's backstory

- Momo and the connection to Joachim Mizrahi

- The subcommittee which I felt had some parallels with those red and blue floating orb heads in Xenogears that were monitoring Fei and co, although the subcommittee's role ended up being extremely small and restricted to show only Juli Mizrahi, and I feel they made her a lot less... cold than she was in Episode 1, which weirdly enough I actually didn't like because her character seemed completely different (ironically the reverse happened with Shion, but ultimately both had a similar negative impression on me)

- Albedo, who is still one of JRPG's and general video game's best villain of all time, gruesomely psychotic and you love every minute of it, not to mention the splendid voice actor that gives it his all for the role

- Chaos and the mystery surrounding him

- Vector's president and the identities of the people in the hoods, 2 new colors (black and white) that are shown in Episode 2, and then all revealed in Episode 3.


While some of these were handled as best as they could in Episode 3 as they were rushing to conclude the trilogy, I still feel overall that they didn't explain somethings well at all, like U-DO. I don't even understand what happened there with the young Fei and Juriev who was possessing Gaignum's body and what that all about was, and I just went... huh?

Same with the gnosis phenomenon, which was the central point driving the entire series, and then we get a shorthand explanation by Wilhelm at the end saying that gnosis are "people who are happy and don't want to live in this universe anymore" and that's it? How... utterly underwhelming, this couldn't have possibly been what they intended for the gnosis to be way back in Episode 1 when Jr showed Shion and the Elsa crew the Betty half human/half gnosis and the research they were doing on the phenomenon. 

On that note, what was the deal with wanting to go back to "Lost Jerusalem" or earth as it were? Even Wilhelm addresses this point when he tells Margulis "what were you even planning on doing once you got there?"

The series ends with them trying to search for Earth, with regular space travel and no more UMN, but... why? The world these games presented to us seem to be a utopia with medicine, nanonmachines, technology, realians, no troubles anywhere, or rather lots of tools to deal with them, so what exactly is so important about going back to earth, besides an archaeological interest in humans' past history and homeland? 

I don't know, all this is actually just a summation of things that I felt were lacking in what were some interesting games that I liked, but however felt could have been **more**, you know what I mean? 


Oh and another thing, for being jrpgs and linear ones at that, I feel like they were way too short, at only 20 hours per playthrough (2 is way shorter) which is half the length of most jrpgs. When Episode 1 ended as soon as they reached Miltia, I was like... wait what? We just started this game. Any other RPG, this would have been the introduction. Other series like Tales of from Namco or Star Ocean 3 which is also set in space, were way longer and I feel that negatively impacts the story of the Xenosaga games since they could have fit the entire story in one game if they wanted to. 

Especially considering there aren't that many sidequests (with 3 boasting absolutely none besides the 2 optional bosses) so with this it seems to imply a greater focus on the story, and yet... the story itself is rather lacking. So many subplots were not covered or not explained as properly as one would think, and in my opinion considering the game's length, they shouldn't have focused on making an episodic jrpg but rather made one whole full game first, *then* looked at making sequels to it.   </TEXT>

Say I was interested in Ann Harlow's filmography and want to see her videos/scenes, where can I even get them? I mean... I doubt an adult video store has them. I know a lot of her scenes are on the porn tubes but I don't know which belongs to which "movie" or anything like that. 

I'm just overall curious how one would even acquire these since there's so much other porn it's doubtful there's any place for them. Even an official website for them or something.  </TEXT>

His voice gets really indistinct at the most crucial moment of explaining the video, and I have no idea what he just did during the battle (or before) to be constantly getting level ups. 

Just curious. I know you don't level AP or SP so it's nearly 50 levels of wasted opportunity to get them, but still interested in trying this method out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Places where the sun never sets, or sets at 11:00 pm, and rises at 2:00 am, what if one was a Muslim there?

Alternately, since the Islamic hijry calendar is a lunar calendar and is always changing, what about places where the sun never comes up or only comes up for half an hour to an hour per day? If a Muslim lives there, can it really count as fasting? 

Because Islam was born in the Arab world, which has relatively consistent hours and sun times year round, it always makes me wonder about stuff like this, especially during the Prophet days with the spreading of Islam, if they thought about how the different timezones and locations on the earth impacted things like Ramadan fasting. </TEXT>

What I kind of find strange is, for being such an insanely meticulous, methodical person, to have her pouch of money just clumsily fall to the floor like that is... well, it just really surprised me. I could have sworn it was an intentional move considering she doesn't seem like the type to make mistakes like that. I mean hell, nearly everyone with that amount of money tied to them would be extremely careful and make sure not to have a slip-up like that, especially in front of people that could easily rob you.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> It's a shame Squaresoft never put their backing into Xenogears, both as a franchise and simply just a single game. *Spoilers* </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-19 15:29:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It could have been a pretty damn good series had it been completed, a third pillar to complement the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest juggernauts at the time.

Having played Xenogears, I saw a lot of good ideas and good elements for story telling that, had the game not been rushed but rather fully realized, could have made it a strong contender for a supporting pillar to the Square brand to accompany the already strong Final Fantasy series back in the day. The end of the game features the title "End of Episode 5" implying it was meant to be a whole series.

Been reading opinions around the internet, and it's got varied opinions with some liking the game and some disliking it. For my part, even after disc 2, I just find myself more fondly remembering the enjoyability of disc 1. I thought the on-foot combat system was especially fun, featuring a sort of fighter battle system like Tales/Star Ocean but actually still being turn-based.

The robot battles were fine and inoffensive, I would have been fine either way but getting an ether doubler and giving it to Elly for her aerods attack does make the robot fights much much better at 9999 damage per turn, and that's just her turn.

Though I can't imaginehad there been more episodesthat they would all feature Gears since a lot of people speculate that the different timelines and past Fei lives and incarnations were ideas for other episodes, of which Xenogears is the 5th one. So I would be fine with games that just featured on-foot combat. Either way, it deserved the full 6 episodes, or at least a fully completed game instead of what happened in Disc 2. 


Overall, it's just a shame the game wasn't as fully realized as it was, and never got the 6 or so episodes that whoever was in charge of was planning. There was so much more that could have been covered with various characters like Emeralda; I mean there's an entire sidequest for her in disc 2 that I would never have even known about without a FAQ, and it's just a shame the game just ends after so there's no point to it. Same with getting Citan's sword, which was only for his on-foot character and not gear.

I dunno, just lamenting what could have been, now that I've finally played and enjoyed the game.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back in 2011 and 2012, most  asmrtists tended to have really poor sound quality and almost all of them had that static, that white noise that completely ruins the asmr experience for me because it's really distracting. 

I remember back in the days of whispercrystal and when asmr maria was first starting out, they were one of the few that had pretty good videos. But the other asmrtists had that white noise and it wasn't helpful. 

However... now as of 2016, most of those asmrtists all updated their equipment, and I just find it amazing and really appreciate how much sound quality has improved. New tinglers are incredibly lucky to experience extreme asmr tingles since the experience is both still new to them so it's more powerful, and they have amazing sound quality to enjoy as well, so you can really hear all the skk skkks and the whispers and such without interference, with a crystal clear sound. 

Just thought it was something that I personally really appreciate.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I mean I wasn't going to hold it against the show when coach left, and sure I cried and had my tears at last year's finale (christ that was a 10/10 season wasn't it)  but I was still excited at what kind of dynamic the Schmidt/Cece engagement will offer now that the will they/won't they part of *their* relationship is over (1 down, 1 to go). 

But... I dunno. Something about this season, if I'm not outright hating it, I'm bored by it. Something seems missing (this is the part where Winston would say "or someone" lol :p ) and I have to say I really don't like the fact that Megan plastic face Fox took up nearly half the season, and more so than that they kept calling her beautiful. Isn't the New Girl creator a staunch feminist or something? I thought she would ostracize women like fox with their endless plastic surgery and looking like an uncanny valley robot human. They couldn't have gotten literally any other female actress in hollywood right now? 

But I digress, it's been 17 episodes in and this season has been... weird. It has no real identity, and the things it does do, seem to fly completely in the face of previous seasons (like Winston falling for Aly? **WHAT**. What happened to "damn girl you conceited ain't nobody wanna have yo babies" and them actually being good friends instead of a stereotypical fall in love storyline?) </TEXT>

But what does Sunny do? A hilarious alteration that in turn also doesn't spoil the twist for people regardless of whether "they should have seen it by now" or not. The episode from season 5 mac and charlie write a movie. When Charlie goes "that dude in the hairpiece, that's Bruce Willis the whole movie" and then his face after he quizzically asks the gang "that wasn't the twist?" just makes me bowl over from laughter. 

I just find that to be one of the sweetest things about the show. They incorporated the joke into the character of charlie and the rest of the gang like mac telling him he'll explain it to him later and just to move past it, that's one of my favorite things about this show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At least according to her tvtropes page.

I don't know what more of a direction they could have taken with her character in the show especially since she never interacts with JD, but I am kinda interested in her abrasiveness and what it might bring to the table now that I've rewatched the show so many times.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unconventional while conventional at the same time.

More comic book movies with little known characters with different backstories to the overly well known "my parents are dead" or "my planet fitness was destroyed" or "with great powder comes great clam chowder" and whatnot.

I mean it's still a conventional story, it's just told in such an unconventional way (which is surprising considering it's 2016) and I love that about the movie. 

I mean, I thought the story would be bigger like maybe Morena's character is actually a mutant or Deadpool breaks up a high conspiracy organization's  giant factory of mutants or some shit like that but nope, it's all about him just wanting to be with his love. You'd think one would not like such a simple story but it's likable, and dare I say it, actually charming. Something I was not expecting at all.

Even the sex scenes, are actually really sweet. Usually an R rating or such means springing for lots of titillation but without any love thinking "oh gross we don't want love we just want boobies" but I thought it was incredibly romantic how they used sex as actually part of establishing a relationship, part of the actual human experience, because yes sex is a part of that, a part of loving someone, and I thought that came across very well, especially because of how they are actually together even after he is suffering from cancer and stuff. 


All in all, I really liked this movie and while I had a feeling that I would, I did not know I would find it so charming.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Nightman Cometh may have been my first episode, but The Gang Dances Their Asses Off is still the greatest finale of all time. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-25 20:23:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> These are well regarded as some of the toppiest tippity top season finales of all time.

I love nightman because it's the very first episode I ever saw, just a random episode from this show I knew nothing about, and I initially thought the premise was "struggling/out of work actors doing an  off off off-broadway type musical" due to the nature of the episode, before finding out the actual premise as I watched the older episodes.

But The Gang Dances Their Asses Off is still the best finale of the show, full of scheming, an excellent plot, hilarious scenes (I can't not laugh at "I'm throwing my cream all over his face/I'm about to show you the white hot cream of an 8th grade boy" every single time) and a great representation of the characters. It's fantastic.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Something amusing happened at the boardwalk today </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-18 10:33:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was walking with my friend on the boardwalk and there were a bunch of rowdy guys sitting by some steps/benches just goofing off right. 

They were pretty loud and stuff, when suddenly these 2 women in rollerblades/rollerskates passed by, moving really slowly and chatting with each other. Now, these were extremely attractive women. And not just regular hot women which you see every day at the beach or whatever, they were wearing very low amount of clothes and had that young/jailbait look of hotness, that makes them increasingly more desirable. 

Anyway the amusing thing is that these rowdy guys goofing off and making a lot of noise all of a sudden just... stopped. They just stopped, and all eyes were on these 2 girls. One of the guys even had his chin literally hang and his mouth open a bit. 

I was talking to my friend during this time and I saw the women, then saw the guys' reaction to the women, and after walking a couple of paces I couldn't help bursting out laughing at how perfectly picturesque that scene was. It was like something out of a cheesy high schoolish movie.

My friend is gay (and a bit vain, though not without good reason since he's incredibly good looking) so he thought the guys were staring at him and he couldn't appreciate the scene so I didn't bother telling him what happened exactly but I thought reddit might get a kick out of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know why they gave up so quickly.

That way they're all equally heavy and no one can immediately tell which one has gold in it. 

Just saying, that's what I thought gold case meant, not that all the briefcases would be empty.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Beaver, behind the whole thing? I can't remember if there were some inconsistencies with his placement at the time of the various crimes, but I will say this, how are we expected to believe he, a teenager, was able to put a bomb on a *plane*, in a post 9/11 world? I mean that's a pretty big plot element, and it's something hard to just suspend disbelief for. 

In addition to this, the fact that they made the guy from Police Academy a molester is so... weird. He was able to molest a *bunch* of boys? I could understand only one, but nearly all of them? That's just highly unlikely. It's like that it's always sunny episode when dennis and Charlie go to report a false rape for the shusher and the detective skeptically asks "so he was raping... both of you? At the same time?" 

I also felt we never really got to see Guttenburg as a creepy molester guy. It all happens offscreen so we don't know why he was doing it, a scene showing him being fucked up in the privacy of his own home just to clue the viewers in, something like that.

It's just that, by not doing this, it seems like the villain of season 2 is actually Beaver, with just an offhanded remark that "oh he got molested and that's why he is the way he is"

I just felt that season 2 was too ambitious in that regard, it wasn't as tightly crafted as season 1 while still having an insanely shocking (but still fits) revelation with the Logan's dad having sex with his son's girlfriend thing. That one was so good and it fit so well and was so terrifyingly fitting, because throughout the season we DID see glimpses of Logan's father being terrifying and having a temper, beating his kid, etc etc.  

At least, that was kind of my initial thoughts when I was blown away by the awesomeness of VM in season 1 and then 2 leading up to the revelation.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-04-05 23:19:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I find it much more depressing than I used to as a teen:
In an effort to win all the mafias, Michael has become... so cold, so cold and calculating. And what has he lost in the process?
 His wife, who no longer loves him, their marriage no more.
 His brother, whom he has killed
And you can feel the tensions rise up between Tom Hagen and Michael Corleone.
That last scene, in which Michael reflects while remembering his father's birthday where he enlists in the Marines, what is the purpose of that scene? There are so many layers to it, I want to see what other people thought of it.
Also, what was the purpose of seeing Vito's rise to mafianess in parallel to Michael's story? I've always wondered that. Is it to see how Vito handled things compared to Michael?
I always thought it was meant to show why everything fell to pieces around Michael but it didn't for Vito, but I don't think it was Michael's fault. For example, Vito had an Italian wife same as him, so they had the same cultural background, but Michael had an American wife, and American women are much different from women in the old country. Different belief and thinking systems, less accepting of "men handle the business and we don't ask questions"
I thought that was a theme in the movie. How the ways of Sicily family mafia thing just don't work in America's way of thinking, like how Kay questions everything Michael does. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I've always found something funny about James Marsden's character on the show (spoilers) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-05 16:45:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> He's the only character that sticks with Liz until the end and she ends up marrying him, finally achieving a happy ending with this guest star (guest star boyfriends/girlfriends in shows are usually only for a couple of episodes and then that's it)

But here's the thing; like  Sean Bean, James Marsden had a running joke in the movie world back in the 2000s where he, a generally nice guy, never ends up with the girl. 

You've got The Notebook where this happens, you've got Superman Returns where he plays the boyfriend of Lois Lane while Superman is away, and even in the X-Men series you had his girlfriend Jean Grey flirting with Wolverine and then that thing that happens at the end of the 2nd movie. Enchanted half counts in that he doesn't end up with the princess but does have a potential romance with the future queen of Frozen Arendelle. 

So in a ton of movies where the girl ends up choosing some other guy despite James Marsden being an extremely decent fellow and (usually) a much better person than the guy the girl chose, it's like Tina Fey made a reference to this by having James Marsden on the show and not leaving him but actually ended up marrying him and adopting a kid together. 

Just thought that was funny. Not sure if overthinking it but that's the first thing that came to my mind way back when season 6 and then 7 were airing. Just kinda sweet in a way, isn't it? </TEXT>

So we all know Hans is the bad guy and this scene does foreshadow it:

http://i.imgur.com/iGlQiPp.jpg

And that's fair, but the scene in the beginning where Hans falls in the water and smiles at his horse, there was no one around to see that, whose benefit was that for, the audience? Not to mention the whole going out of his way to help the citizens, help Elsa from being shot with a crossbow arrow, only to haphazardly go out in the ice to slice her with a sword? It just seems like such a cheat to make him all of a sudden evil to force fit the sister love ending and the awfully fast (not to mention anticlimactic) way everything wraps up.

I'm just saying, it was clear there were a lot of re-writes with the Frozen script. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Poor Josh... at least he could do voices. That episode where he's copying Jack and Tracy's voice back in season 1 was a classic. 

Then they brought in Jack er I mean Danny in season 4 but by mid to the end of the season, forgot him just the same and didn't know what other stories to include him in. The show has always been about Liz Jack, Tracy and Jenna, and Kenneth, with some subplots about the writers and Hornberger (yes!) . There just wasn't room for anything with him. 

I like that episode where they reminisce and Danny tries to convince himself that the past memories were of him as Josh.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Nine is one of the weirdest movie roles that Daniel Day-Lewis has ever chosen. (safety spoilers) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-23 21:33:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here's a guy with such a selective choice of movies that he only does a couple every decade, and has now won 3 oscars, securing the most out of any actor in history.

9 is not a bad movie per se, it's just... eh, you know? A cliche riddled meh movie that DDL had decided to star in, and in the movie itself has Marion Cotillard as a wife but decides to cheat with Penlope Cruz? Over Marion Cotillard? Absolutely absurd.

I've always wondered why he chose that, when in the past the kind of movies he's chosen were My Left Foot, Last of the Mohicans, Gangs of New York, There Will Be Blood,  and Lincoln. Nine seems like an odd misstep (again not a bad movie but... considering DDL's picky tastes, what made him choose this over other roles)

The movie is a musical and I guess it's alright, the songs are kinda catchy and I guess that's all that matters, I'm assuming he chose the role because he wanted to try his hand at singing. But otherwise it's a very uninteresting movie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Linking Quantum again, that's what I've always wanted. Saying that Silva and quantum and le chiffe and s*** were all under blofeld? Not so sure about that. Silva didn't seem like a team player, what with being a joker rip-off.

This felt so forced I feel like blofeld on the whole thing should have taken up 2 movies, or at least been developed FAR more in Spectre. Too much of it and him felt underdeveloped and rushed.

There's no explanation as to how all these pieces fit together. It's just "oh I was behind everything you ever knew, mwahahaha!"

What's to stop another villain in the next movie from taking credit and saying "you know how that guy said he was behind everything the whole time? Well *I* was actually behind **that** the whole time!"

And it just goes on and on forever.

I think the motivation behind having everything linked is flimsy.


Okay. So Blofeld installed C in MI6 and organized terrorist attacks to pressure South Africa into signing on to the Nine Eyes program. He's really running this intelligence sharing apparatus. Okay. What's he going to do with it once it's up and running? We're never given a clear idea of what Spectre's goals are. They do things - have a hand in human trafficking, plus the activities witnessed in the last three movies - but what's the endgame?

But the real bit where it fell apart for me was the revelation that Blofeld was Bond's brother, and was intentionally directing the events of the previous movies in an attempt to make his life miserable, because jealousy. The hell? That's Iron Man 3 levels of underwhelming villain motivation. The fact that Bond himself is unphased by this revelation also serves to make it even more pointless.


It really feels like they wanted to do a bunch of different concepts for Bond 24 and tried to Frankenstein them together. Let's see, we have:

Judi Dench's M sends Bond on one last mission from beyond the grave.
MI6 is ensnared in a paranoia-fueled intelligence/surveillance ring that's being manipulated by the very people they're trying to combat.
Tie up loose ends from the first two films of the reboot, specifically Mister White and the Quantum organization.
Bring back SPECTRE into the new continuity.
Bond vs his never-before mentioned lost evil step-brother; rectify contradictory background information in Casino Royale and Skyfall
Bond finds true love and considers quitting OHMSS style or whatever.


It's just too much to juggle in two and a half hours. If they'd limited themselves to two, maybe three of these concepts, they could have something more cohesive. </TEXT>

Who do you root for or like best? I weirdly really like Peepers the more the show went on, is that strange? I also wonder if Garfield is meant to be "the innocent" that gets corrupted by this evil family. 

Anyway if I were to compare it to other shows, I'd say it sort of feels like an it's always sunny series but in the early 20th century. And I love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Funny isn't it. I just realized something I never really payed attention to before, why wasn't Cece's mom in season 2 when Cece was about to get married of all things. I can't remember if they told a reason. 

Also with how strict she seems, no way she remotely approves of her daughter having been a model, she probably didn't give her approval there. 

I suppose Cece not even finishing high school could probably be explained by her taking the modeling job in defiance of her mother, that seems to make the most sense. 

I wonder if it explains more or less about the Cece character.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For all the hate the also disappointing x-men 3 gets, I found days of future past to be just as disappointing. 

With the terrible mystique performance by j-law that might actually be worse than her initial terrible performance in first class, the boring past segments saved only by the quicksilver performance, I would have much rather seen a movie with that future only and find out how all those new x-men interacted with each other. 

It seems its entire existence hinged on resetting the universe, not like it was that great a universe to begin with (only X2 stands as bring the greatest in the franchise) and the actors not getting any younger anyway. 

I mean, all the comic book nerds were telling me that dofp was one of the greatest xmen stories ever, something like the killing joke for batman, and in the end I found the movie just ok, with quite a few detriments like mystique's performance and everything with past magneto and killing off the first class actors off screen  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Isn't it funny how that works? In terms of the number of spy movies last year and just fun movies in general, I thought Kingsman was all around immature and terrible, even though I love colin firth. I mean parts of it were ok, but none of the characters were likable, and that definitely includes the main character "eggsy". And that villain plan was just plain old stupid, and I'm not talking about the entertaining kind of stupid that Bond villains have like starting a civilization under the sea or building a base on the moon. 

It just didn't click with me. Which is a shame. 

Now as for Spy, the trailers made it look like the typical "epic movie" parody crap, but what we got instead was something surprisingly funny and even more surprisingly heartwarming with a great performance by the lead female. I also love the nod to action comedy in scenes like the kitchen area where they were fighting and she was improvising with pots and pans, now that is the kind of organic fighting that jackie Chan would be proud of, as the king of action comedy scenes. 

All in all, I just thought it was an interesting twist in how trailers and expectations can be shattered when seeing a movie.  </TEXT>

I mean maybe an episode dedicated to Suzuki would have helped with this glossing over. Sure we can probably infer that Blaine scratched him/infected him in some way (wonder how though, as captain he probably doesn't go on street calls, so how Blaine came into contact is a bit less obvious)

But what about how Suzuki felt over the whole thing. Probably regret, but did he not want to tell anybody? And if he did regret it then why did he help Blaine by telling her about Liv in the morgue (even thought Blaine already knew) and why did he never talk with Liv? I kept waiting for a scene with the two that never actually happened. That surprised me. 

Did he torch the place because he thought that there might be some evidence linking back to him, or... ? It just wrapped up so quickly I kind of can't get over it.

<TEXT> Hell, it didn't even have a full first season, only 14 episodes! That's just a little over half the typical episode count of a typical broadcast season in America.
I didn't feel this sad when I first finished the 14 episodes and movie. It's only something that's been stewing inside me again and again as I go to sleep at night, wondering what kind of episodes and direction and plot lines we would have gotten had it gone on for 7 seasons like say, Buffy.
I do like the movie but I can't help but wonder how awesome it would be for River's badassness to gradually progress as we saw hints of it in the show, culminating in the badass warrior she became by like, the 3rd or 4th season, or something like that.
As for the Reavers plot line... I dunno if they could do what they did in the movie on a TV budget? With the whole Operative guy and the spaceship battle and whatnot, I just wonder. I look at the show and I think the special effects must have been really expensive way back in frickin 2002.
Anyway, that brings me to another plot line concerning the operative, Shepherd book. Seeing his backstory gradually unfold over the seasons instead of in a comic would have been so much better. Not to mention probably would have been much different and better than what we got (which admittedly is still better than nothing)
I dunno, I'm just feeling really melancholic over the whole thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Skye's mom and her sudden turn to absolute uncompromising evil. I mean, I was angry sure when she murdered edwards james olmos (regardless of my feelings towards the hypocritical secret "real" shield plotline) like that and started her plan, and was killing agents willy nilly, but the moment where she was truly irredeemable, like freaking SELFISH evil, is when she tried to kill Skye/suck up her life. What in the actual fuck, that's her daughter, the daughter that she apparently turned Cal into a monster just to find, and this is how the series ends, with her trying to kill her daughter?

I mean... with the way they played out the little tiny bits of her past, I just don't... that just really rubs me the wrong way. Up until then, everything she did was "extremist but looking out for her inhumans a la magneto and mutants, horribly misguided and wrong, but would never hurt one of her own like that" and yet she literally hurt her own, her own flesh and blood. 

With how intensive season 2 was especially the last bits, I was still reeling but had these thoughts, and after rewatching the episodes I'm able to process that whole transformation into evil.

I mean even if she did succeed, what was her end game after making the world inhumans and all regular humans dead? More importantly they just all of a sudden dropped the whole Afterlife storyline, specifically there was supposed to be this secret council that Sky's mom reports to/answers to/etc, where are they. If she had taken over the world, was her intention to rule it or just make everyone inhumans and then sit back.

I dunno there's just so much I wanted to ask about and yet they got rid of skye's mom just as quickly as they introduced her, and there's just a large juxtaposition between the woman that was captured by whitehall in the beginning of season 2 and the woman at the end of season 2. More backstory would have helped ease that punch to the gut, at least when they did the punch gut with Ward's reveal, they actually went through his entire past and history.

<TEXT> I've always known about Bioshock, a friend once let me try their copy back in 2008, and I'd always hear about it having a great story, but I was never a fan of shooters so dismissed it for so long. 

Then this year I was able to get my own copy, and I tried out the game... and bam. I loved it IMMEDIATELY. Andrew Ryan, his whole dogma, Rapture the city under the sea, this game was fan freaking tastic. I just had so much damn fun with it. 

From the very beginning I was enthralled and utterly captivated by the mood and setting. Was freaked out by the big daddies and even more so by the little girls (never did understand how they were like that but then also easily able to be "fixed" and return back to being little girls that I assume grow up and age normally and can bear children and everything no complications, but then again the endings for this series have always been... a jarring tonal shift that's not too great) 

Was shocked at the twist (so glad I was able to avoid it for so long) and while I feel it all ended kinda... rapidly, up until we were in Andrew Ryan's lair it was great. And I love that face down with Andrew Ryan and his line "a man chooses a slave obeys"

Basically, I just want to share my love for a series I never thought I'd like but proved me wrong with just how good it was, to the point that I wanted to get the other games just to experience them after this one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hell, it didn't even have a full first season, only 14 episodes! That's just a little over half the typical episode count of a typical broadcast season in America.

I didn't feel this sad when I first finished the 14 episodes and movie. It's only something that's been stewing inside me again and again as I go to sleep at night, wondering what kind of episodes and direction and plot lines we would have gotten had it gone on for 7 seasons like say, Buffy. 

I do like the movie but I can't help but wonder how awesome it would be for River's badassness to gradually progress as we saw hints of it in the show, culminating in the badass warrior she became by like, the 3rd or 4th season, or something like that.

If so, how does that work in America, is that even legal? Is there like a corner street office or building that girls apply to where they're screened and then given the cash and fucked by that one guy who never shows his face? 

I'm honestly just curious over how it all works, especially when I see relatively normal looking girls like that one cutie from gdp ep 286:

<DATE> 2015-11-20 14:36:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off just wanna preface this topic by saying I started watching this show at the beginning of 2015 after hearing about it for ages and dismissing it. Started from the pilot and... I immediately loved this show. I've gone all around the internet seeing posts how you should "stick with it since by midseason it gets better" but I loved it absolutely immediately, and liked all the characters, so by the time that whole Hydra thing exploded onto the scene, I was on a wild rollercoaster of thrills. This was... this was the show I always wanted, this was the show to replace my bitter sentiments towards Lost. I hadn't been hyped up or actively watching/engaging in discussion about a show since Lost 10 years ago, and Agents of Shield is already proving that it can present mysteries and intrigue, AND wrap them up. Really showcases how we're in a golden age of television with phenomenal writing, displaying character development and strong plotlines hand in hand. 

Anyway on to the topic, my question is, how much DID they have planned out or written? The show premiered fall 2013. Was there always an intention before the Hydra reveal and the Winter Soldier to have all that stuff happen, introducing Hydra, Ward being an evil villain all along (when that happened and he shot the agents and the woman, I literally screamed noooo, literally. It was like a punch to the gut. I still remember that feeling)

How much cross collaboration and screenwriting was there, if any, between Winter Soldier people and agents of shield people? I'm just wondering how much was planned ahead. 

And this ties into the second question of introducing the inhumans, since they had that "tahiti" and the kree body and Skye stuff happen from the very beginning, so how how much are they planning ahead? It seems rather amazing, since again I'm going by the last episodic show I used to be into, Lost, whose writers just made up shit as they went along. How much did they plan ahead in order to introduce the inhumans, was it always meant that way, did they always mean to introduce Hydra, have Ward turn evil, etc etc? 

Also, who here agrees that Skye's transformation (both literal and character development wise) is one of the best things this show ever had. In  the beginning she was kinda... well you could even classify her as annoying, an almost teen like character straight from the gossip girl/cw show crap of characters and the like, with early episodes trying to maybe boast off her sex appeal more so than likability. And then that all changed when she matured, was able to handle her own, and become one of the best characters on the show, the character the audience identifies with and looks to as the moral compass (especially in season 2, felt so bad for her when they didn't know what they were dealing with and had her locked up in the lab). I just love that about this already magnificent show.

How much are they planning ahead, and this being part of the larger MCU, it's making me wonder, is there an endpoint they're all leading up to, will they ever have universe crossings like with previous Whedon shows Angel and Buffy? I ask because of the villains they se up in the beginning of the show, especially one in particular, Gravitron. I know it's the other Whedon who is in charge of Agents of Shield, I'm just wondering how much they're planning out, because I'm loving the show and was so glad ABC didn't cancel it because it's just phenomenal. I actually was more invested in the season 2 finale movie-length episode than Avengers 2! That's how much I've become drawn to the show. 

Appreciate any comments and thoughts on the show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So they had an all new opening (which is nice to include all the other characters) and then coach ends up leaving by the end of the season? Come on. 

I hope it's not true, because Coach's inclusion in season 4 really shifted the dynamic and made the show even more fantastic than thought possible, and as hilarious as it is for 5 people to live in one tiny loft with only 1 bathroom, they had a lot of great stories with the characters.

 I'd just be really sad to see him go. Season 4's greatness was a silver lining to Happy Endings being canceled, since it meant Coach returning, but if he's leaving New Girl as well... I dunno, what do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few months ago I asked for help on here on a blonde british girl trying out lingerie "for your wife" in a store and being all naughty asking questions like "what would your wife say if she saw you getting hard watching another women try out lingerie for her."

Anyway I didn't get any help but I found the model, her name is chloe toy apparently and also she's a cam-ish girl, so she doesn't do hardcore scenes, so this was a bust. 

This is an example of a video of hers:

I always forget the name of the chick with glasses, she'd actually look really hot if she didn't do the European thing of having one side of her head shaved off, what the hell even is that. Or in this case just cut short. But she'd still look really hot with long flowing hair. 

Girl in green has a such great smile but midway in the video it almost looks like she's shaking her head and regretting this charade. Why are they even finishing on her face instead of inside her is my main concern.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The problem with deleted scenes in animated movies is they're always just storyboards. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Unlike live action movies which don't need much besides the camera and actors, cg and animated movies require a ton of effort to create their scenes, so the deleted scenes are never actually drawn or computer generated, they're just in black and white rough sketches and/or feature  rudimentary cg work like in that one canceled opening scene for how to train your dragon 2.

It's just a shame because I love seeing the deleted scenes for Disney's animated movies like snow white or Aladdin or jungle book.  </TEXT>

There's also an earlier scene that I absolutely love. Its with the guy who dropped the ball and let the black dude go to jail who later hanged himself. He's talking about how they don't matter, its just nickel and dimes, and al Pacino goes "don't you care? They're people. They're just... people"

Mark Ruffalo was stupendous, so many comedic moments and heartfelt moments. 

I felt so sorry for Zoe Saldana's character since she was just trying to have the best for her girls. 

And the 2 children actresses were great, I'm surprised with how organic their acting was. 

This movie truly deserves a lot of recognition. It had a lot of laughs, and a lot of heart.  </TEXT>

I remember when I first started watching gentlewhispering 3.5 years ago, back then I didn't really know much about asmr, I just enjoyed her one video where she has her hand in front of the mirror and does this really surreal effect that's very fun to watch. 

I had no idea then that this woman would have the most views out of any of the asmrtists ever. 

How did that happen? I'd like to know asmr history.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Like really good. Only part I didn't agree with was they kept calling rachel ugly. I think she is beautiful. Like come on movie, you cant expect us to suspend our disbelief and think of this woman as ugly. 

One part I liked is how I saw the "hot" girl that the main character likens to a moose trampling a chipmunk. When she first appeared I was like "lol what, this is your movie's *hot girl*? With those eyebrows and that face?" She wasn't ugly per se just a bit... I don't want to say homely, but... regular. 

But as the movie went on, I ended up finding her very attractive because of her personality. She wasn't the stereotypical haughty popular girl with a sour face the entire movie or b**** "hot" as it were. She was actually really nice, and sweet, and smart, with no bulls***. I liked that about her. It was actually the main character who I wanted to punch just like earl did and I love that about the movie, showcasing the almost crippling self-loathing and narcissism of the protagonist. 

Also liked a lot of the supporting players. 

All around, I knew I was gonna like this movie and just when you think you're gonna hate its inevitable ending it does something to redeem it somewhat. </TEXT>
