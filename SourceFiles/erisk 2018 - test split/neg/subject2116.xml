<TITLE> The Specimen </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm an archivist at an old university and recently there's been a push to reorganize the catacombs of records and boxes under the library. Some of it is cool, most of it is boring, but one is so bizarre I can't keep it to myself. Neither my boss nor my coworkers know about this box, but honestly I don't think they'd have any better ideas about it than you guys do.

I found the box in a closet in a forgotten corner of the archives, covered in dust. Inside were x-rays and autopsy reports of something that seemed like a new species of giant squid, and this moleskin journal from the 1990s. A lot of the pages were math and chemical equations I don't really understand, and there were a lot of maps of the extreme north of Canada with a route all marked out in the Arctic Circle. There are some journal entries and newspaper clippings, too, which is where it gets really weird. I'll transcribe them as best as I can; any censorship was from the original, and is demarked with a "-."

*September 12, 19*

The team managed to find the resting place based off the manuscript and returned the specimen from the explorer's so-called "sunken city." A further archaeological dig is planned for the ruins they found there, but the specimen is the true prize. It remained perfectly preserved in the permafrost and there is no sign of decay from the journey back. All these years of research have finally paid off!

I have sent blood and tissue samples to the lab for analysis of the specimen. Superficially, it resembles some form of primordial squid, but how the manuscript spoke of it makes me believe that it is far more than a squid. I begin the dissection tomorrow.

---

*September 13, 199*

As I suspected, the specimen only superficially resembles a massive giant squid. Its inner structure are unlike any cephalopod I have ever seen  an early stage of evolution, or something far more? The samples are still being analyzed, of course; I'll know for sure then.

I dreamed of being in deep, dark water last night, floating down to the stygian depths, peaceful and cold. The descriptions of the specimen's habitat were very poetic, courtesy of Dr. D-, and must've effected more than I thought.

---

*September 20, 199*

The lab was unable to analyze the samples and described them as "alien to what we have seen before." I am overjoyed  there is still so much to be done, I could have found rue evidence of alien life on Earth. I have sent more samples for chemical analysis.

My graduate assistant, C-, hates being alone in the room with the preserved specimen, He claims the creature "stares" at him, which is absurd. It's dead and in life it had only light sensors instead of proper eyes. C- has always been so imaginative.

---

*September 30, 199*

When I was ten, I went swimming in the lake outside my grandparents' summer home. No one was paying attention when I slipped underwater. I was certain I was going to die. Yet I felt something grip me and deliver me safely to shore. I was certain I saw my savior, but I couldn't remember their face.

But last night, in my dreams, I saw it. The specimen saved me.

It has not decayed since we brought it here. C- left me, claiming it whispered to him in the night. It whispers to me, too  of places beneath the ice and snow, where more lurk alongside the truth. To know it I must return it to its home.

---

The journal stops there, the rest of the pages were blank. In the box were also clippings from the school newspaper. The university keeps online copies of the papers from 1970s, but when I looked these articles weren't there. Looking into the local and national papers found no mention of these events, and trust me when I say I've got a literal degree in finding these sorts of things. The university has a lot of powerful alumni and the internet was still in its infancy, so it wouldn't surprise me if the news got completely scrubbed out. I transcribed the articles, too, since they weren't too long and I don't want them to vanish.

*ARCTIC EXPEDITION UNCOVERS CEPHALOPOD ANCESTOR?*

An expedition headed by Doctor D- went to the Canadian Artic to investigate First Nations' stories of large squids, first described in the 1800s French explorer J- M-'s newly found diaries. In the permafrost they found what is described as a "primordial squid," which has been released to cephalopod expert Doctor A-.

"It's an unprecedented discovery," Dr. A- commented. "I am so happy to be part of such a monumental discovery."

As the specimen is analyzed, this paper has been promised to be the first one Dr. A- and Dr. D- will report to!

*GRADUATE STUDENT MISSING*

C- B-, a 24-year-old student pursuing a Ph.D. in marine biology, has not been seen or heard from since last Tuesday, according to P- police.

Before his disappearance, friends and family report that C- spoke insistently of something with "too many eyes" watching him. His mother, A- B-, believes he is having a mental health crisis, and may be a danger to himself.

If you have any information about C- B-'s whereabouts, please call the P- Police Department at  as soon as possible. The B- family and loved ones are offering a small reward for information that leads to C-'s safe return.

*PROFESSOR FOUND DEAD, SPECIMEN MISSING*

At 2:00 AM yesterday, professor of marine biology K- A- was found dead by Lake C-, causes "unknown but suspicious."

An examination of Dr. A-'s office and lab found a squid specimen he was examining has gone missing, along with some of his notes and research. Written on the wall of the laboratory were the words "IT WILL BE FREE."

Dr. A-'s graduate assistant was missing student C- B-. Police refuse to comment if the two incidents are related. If you have any information, please contact P- Police at  as soon as possible.

---

That's all that exists of this whole incidents.

I filed the box away with other failed biology experiments and hope to forget about the whole thing. I think I know what lake they're talking about  people drown there all the time, but their bodies never surface again.

I don't think the specimen was truly dead, just dreaming and watching and waiting for someone to bring them out of its primordial grave and release them unto the world. It must still be there, in the water, waiting for us in the depths.

<TEXT> My hometown was small and godly.

Every Sunday we'd all gather at the big brick church and listen to Pastor James tell us we were lesser sinners compared to the outside world, but sinners all the same. We'd all dress in our best and then afterward gossip about those who didn't come under the guise of worrying about their spiritual path. Everyone went to church in our town, our heads bent in supplication.

I never fit in with the other boys. I was small and slender, and not very good at sports, especially the football my brothers excelled in. The first and last time I went hunting, I vomited at the sight of the sliced open doe and embarrassed my father. I hated when my older brothers would roughhouse, running to my room to draw instead.

It was easy to tell my father was disappointed.

I knew, intellectually, that there was a world outside the little town, but it was so hard to see past the thick, impenetrable forest that embraced us. Only a single road connected us to the outside, and I only had left the green cradle a handful of times. The world outside, said Pastor James, was drowning in its filth and sin.

Thus we were all shocked when someone new came to town.

Mrs. Henderson had died four months before, and her house was up for sale one day and the next it wasn't. My bedroom looked across both of our backyards and to the house. From my window seat, I peered out my curtains and saw people moving boxes into it. I clutched at the drapes, white-knuckled, as the stranger stepped out.

He was beautiful, a statue kissed to life, and his dark eyes glittered and his brown hair curled around his sharp jaw. His Oxford shirt was white, the sleeves rolled up his powerful forearms and the top buttons undone to show the top of his broad chest. He made a circuit around the backyard, a soft smile on his ruby lips, and I dropped my curtains closed. My heart was beating wildly, a flush upon my cheeks. I never felt so flustered, my stomach tying itself in knots.

"Luke!" my mother called, tapping on the door. "Let's meet our new neighbor!"

I got out of my window seat and straightened out my clothes. Meekly, I followed behind her as we went to greet our new neighbor. Mom was proud of being the first one to knock at his door. The stranger opened it, and close like this I could smell the rich scent of his cologne and see the shadow of stubble on his angular face. I had no words for the feelings coursing through my veins.

"Hello!" my mother giggled, heady as if the stranger's presence was intoxicating. "My name's Laura, and this my youngest, Luke. We wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood."

"I'm Alexander," he said, voice low and melodic like a fine red wine. His eyes slid from Mom to me, and it felt like I was being flayed open by his cool, assessing gaze. "It was lovely for you to come over."

My mother giggled again, making meaningless small talk with Alexander for a handful of minutes. I forced myself to look away from him for a moment, and instead focused on the thing hanging on the wall behind him.

The skull of a bull, bleached white by the sun, and the dark shadows of its eye sockets were boring into me. I could barely breathe, could barely hear my mother invite Alexander to dinner and him accept. I snapped out of it when my mother bid him goodbye, and I followed behind her back home.

That night, sleepless, I looked out of my window to see the lights of Alexander's home were alight and the man himself coming out carrying a lantern. Its orange light jostled with each step and highlighted the tight, defined lines of his bare torso. I watched him walk without hesitation into the dark expanse of trees and, terrified for reasons I could not explain, I raced underneath my covers to hide for the rest of the night.

---

I helped my mother clean the house while my father watched sports. Pastor James said alcohol was the Devil's drink, so Dad drank Coca-Cola instead of beer.

Mom laid out roast beef and potatoes on our fancy platters, placing them on our nice white table cloth. My parents sat on either end of the table, and Alexander sat across from me; he wore a burgundy sweater, his hair neatly combed. He smiled at me like we shared a secret, and I looked down at my plate.

"Thanks to our Lord Jesus for this bounty," Dad intoned. "Thank You for our good health and prosperity, and for our new friend and neighbor. Amen."

"Amen," we murmured in response, and dug in.

"What brings you to our little town, Alexander?" Dad asked.

"I've been all over the world, from Greece to India," Alexander replied. "I've seen all kinds of things. I just wanted something a little more...quiet."

"That's wonderful!" Mom said. "This is a great place to raise children."

"Mhm," Alexander hummed. "Do you have many children?"

"Three sons," Dad said. "Johnny is at University of Oregon and Mark's at Michigan State. Both are on their football team's starting lines."

"How wonderful," Alexander said. "Are you a football player too, Luke? Where do you plan on going to college?"

"Oh, Luke's more of an artist than a sports guy," Dad said. "He's going to take a gap year after graduation to figure out what he really wants to do."

I remember my mother and father telling me they weren't going to waste money on a "useless degree" and I had to earn the money for art school myself. My cheeks burned.

"We all have our talents," Alexander said. "We all have our places in the world."

"Luke's won awards for his drawings!" Mom said. "He'll show you after dinner."

I was scarlet. "They aren't...they aren't that good."

"I'm sure they're better than you think," Alexander said. The conversation was steered towards more pleasant climes.

After dinner, Mom showed Alexander the art hung in the hallway  little still lives of the forest, the church, some fruits. Childish things. Embarrassing. I slipped into the kitchen to get a drink of water.

The forest ran against the side of the house, and the kitchen sink window looked out into it. The moon was shrouded in black that night, so only the house casted ghostly light on to the woods. The trees moved strangely to me, branches twitching like clutching hands. Beyond the curtains of green needles, I swore I saw something tall and white move among them. I stared, unable to look away, as the white grew closer and closer

"Luke."

I jumped, startled, and Alexander said apologetically, "I didn't mean to scare you."

"It's fine," I said. "I just...I'm fine."

Alexander smiled, closed mouth and piercing. He moved like a tiger in the grass, reaching up to tuck a lock of my honey blond hair behind my ear. My mouth parted, tongue sticky. "You're a talented artist. It's a shame you'll waste away here."

"What?" I murmured. Alexander's hand dropped to my shoulder, grip firm.

"Do you think you'll go to school, after your gap year?" Alexander asked me, voice barely a breath. "Do you think your brothers would come to this place again, to take care of your parents when they are old and frail?"

In the living room, I could hear my parents laughing as if they were drunk. Alexander cupped my face, tilting my head up to stare upon him, and I trembled.

"You shouldn't be contained to banal still life in a dying town," he told me. "You should be part of the world. Capture it with both hands."

I looked down, lashes brushing against my cheeks, and couldn't think of a single word to say. Alexander released me, and I sagged.

"Just think about it, Luke," Alexander spoke to me, and left. I sunk to my knees on the kitchen floor. My parents were still laughing, loud and demented. The forest shuddered.

---

On Sunday, we all went to church.

My family sat in the third row of pews, and Alexander sat opposite of us. He smiled at me before being drawn into a conversation with Pastor James's beautiful wife. My mother always thought her lipstick was too garish for church.

Pastor James came up to the front of the church, and the congregation settled down. He looked red and angry, different from his usual stern calm. And his sermon was different, too  instead of talking of godly communities and being good Christians, he spoke of the corruption of the flesh. He railed against pornography, homosexuality, sex  things he rarely spoke of before.

His voice rose higher and higher, and the congregation began to scream along with him, joining together into a roaring drone. People were standing, stomping and crying in ways I've never seen before. I sat, shocked still, and tried to make sense of what was happening around me.

"Shed off earthly desire, earthly attachment," Pastor James called out. "Burn all the vanities and idols of man!"

I turned my head, and beside me stood Alexander, deathly calm and his hand outstretched. I took it, and he tugged me out of the church. I stumbled out into the freezing air and saw that it was night  which meant it must have been twelve hours since morning service began. Alexander placed his hand on my throat.

"How clean is this air?" Alexander asked me. "How freeing it is, to be outside? Follow me and I will show you true worship."

His hand gripped mine, and he took me past the town into the tall pillars of trees. Colors blurred together, the wind-blown pine trees singing out mourning dirges. Before me, Alexander changed  his hair grew long and wild, his clothes melting into long purple robes, ivy growing up about his feet. He drew me deeper and deeper into the trees until we broke into a clearing.

Up in the sky, the round moon was silver and naked. There was a flat gray stone in the middle of the tall grass, and on it stood a gleaming white bull more docile than a lamb. I fell to my knees in supplication, forehead to the ground in awe of what I saw.

"No more kneeling," Alexander commanded. "Don't you want to be free of this place?"

I looked up at Alexander. He was crowned by the moon, and ivy grew in his long hair.

"Yes," I murmured, and then, loud and ecstatic I cried, "*Yes!*"

"Then rise and show me!" Alexander yelled.

I stood and stripped myself naked, stumbling towards the white bull. I place my hand flat on its nose, and the steam of its breath rose into the air. Alexander gripped on of its horns and tilted its head back, dragging a glittering knife across its jugular. The warm blood drenched me, and when it poured into my mouth, it tasted like wine.

I laughed in ecstasy and Alexander gripped my chin, hot breath fanning across my face. I looked at him, eyes half-lidded and mouth panting.

"Let yourself be liberated," he told me.

I stumbled out into the town from the forest, and in front of the church a bonfire was roaring. The congregation was throwing vanities and idols into it under the direction of Pastor James. When I stepped into the flickering light, Pastor James pointed at me.

"A witch!" he accused. "Look at him who signed his soul to the Devil! Look at him who brings only ruin and damnation!"

Alexander rested his hands on my hips, and I raised a steady arm at Pastor James, my eyes fixed upon him. He started coughing and hacking, bloody phlegm coming up from his throat, and the congregation froze as he fell to the Earth, red foam oozing out his mouth as he choked to death.

"I will be free from this place," I commanded. "I will be free from these people."

One by one, the congregation threw themselves into the fire, not making a single noise as they burned to death. Alexander held me as we watched. My father was last, and he smiled beatifically as he stepped into the flames.

Alexander pressed his plush lips to my ear, hands slicking across the blood on my skin, and whispered, "I have many things to show you."

I tilted my head back against his shoulder, shaking with all my eagerness to *see.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a serial killer in my city.

He came into the houses of men and tortured them before slicing their slender throats. He preferred his victims slight, blond, and lonely, coming for them in the night. The radio told me this as I brushed my pale hair before bed, the host's voice bouncing through my cavernous house.

My husband was off at a convention for psychologists and neurologists, leaving me alone in our beautiful house in our quiet neighborhood. I stood in front of my bathroom mirror, smoothing perfumed lotions across my white skin and rubbing balm across my red lips  even if he wasn't there, I wanted to be beautiful for him. The radio was telling single men to buy security systems and guns to protect themselves from the "Blond Killer."

I padded downstairs, draped in a deep blue robe, and closed the curtains on the tall windows. The bright flood lights stretched across the manicured lawn, swallowed up by the fog rolling across the city. In it danced strange shadows, and I closed the blinds not to see them. I armed the security system and went back upstairs, turning off the lights as I went.

In my bedroom, my robe slid off and pooled to the floor. Under the covers, I sent a text to my husband - *love you, miss you* - and fell asleep after his response  *love you too, beautiful.*

I awoke to a hand on my throat.

"Wake up, bitch," the Blond Killer hissed. I gasped, tugged out of my bed by my hair and shoved to the floor. "Where's the fucking basement?"

I stood up on shaking legs, and he pressed a knife to my throat. The murderer and I went down to the basement, the only light strange foggy twilight coming from the cracks in the drapes and turning into pure darkness as we descended the stairs.

My husband's domain was the partially unfinished basement with its cold concrete floors and harsh halogen lights. He did so much of his research down here. The Blond Killer stopped when he saw the big metal slab in the center of the basement and grinned.

"Your owner's already introduced you to my games, huh?" he hissed in my ear. "Heard those rich fuckers are real kinky  I bet you know how to do all sorts of things for money."

I was silent, staring forward at the hanging plastic curtains that divided the basement. The Blond Killer pushed me against the metal surgery table, pelvis banging against it, and my hand slipped under. This wasn't the first time I tangoed.

I painted a gun at his shocked face. My own was perfectly blank.

"Drop the knife."

He did.

"Back up and turn around."

He did.

"You're too sloppy picking your victims," I said, walking him to the plastic curtains. "A slave to your passions. Easy to manipulate."

The plastic curtains parted to show a row of wire dog cages, chained to the wall and water bottles attached to them. He cried out, but I forced him inside and locked the door with a padlock. The key went around my neck, slipping under my sleep shirt.

"My husband studies serial killers," I told him softly. "He's going to love picking your brain."

He screamed obscenities at me as I left, turning off the lights as I went.

---

My husband came home from his conference two days later.

I greeted him at the door, taking off his jacket and tie, pressing a little kiss to his chin  my husband was tall, powerful hands stroking my hips.

"I got a welcome home present for you," I said. "It's in the basement."

He ravished my mouth in his joy. "You're perfect, my darling. What did I do to deserve you?"

I laughed, holding his hand as I brought him down to the basement. Upon being exposed to the light, the subject thrashed but it was weak from lack of food. My husband looked at it, calculating and cold.

"How wonderful," he said. "Nurse, please prepare a sedative for it."

I immediately went to work. He dressed in scrubs.

"We're going to see what makes you tick," my husband said. "Did you know a majority of serial killers experienced a traumatic brain injury in childhood? Was your frontal lobe damaged?"

"Fuck you," it swore. My husband just smiled.

"You'll tell me everything about yourself eventually," he said pleasantly. "They always do."

I gave the sedative to the subject, causing it to fall unconscious. My husband dragged it out of the cage and stripped it of its clothes; I gathered them and threw them into the incinerator. The subject was strapped down ot the metal table, and an IV was inserted. He administered the antidote for the sedative, and the subject came to slowly. When it realized it was trapped, it began to thrash.

"I'm going to get to the core of you," my husband said, matter-of-fact. "Once you have no more useful information, I'm going to crack open your skull and dissect your brain."

He gripped his chin.

"I'm going to see what makes you sick," he murmured, so low and rough it made me shiver.

We pulled up our surgical masks. I turned on the camera. He picked up a scalpel, disinfecting and gleaming.

"Subject thirty-seven, known as the Blond Killer," he said coolly. "Obsessed with torturing and killing blond men  evidence of repressed homosexuality, perhaps. Fortunately, I have a lovely blond assistant to help me understand his sexual psychosis."

I pressed myself against him with an excited whimper; he touched me sweetly as it watched.

"Let us begin with the barbiturate-amphetamine mix," he told me. "If that doesn't work, we'll move on to the drill." </TEXT>

That Halloween, the whole town was convinced that any party was going to end with a slasher massacre and all the parents agreed with them. Photos of Terry Lewis in the clearing had been leaked, and no one really argued over the school sponsored Halloween party in the gym.

I knelt in Auguste's room, at his feet, and he crowned me with fake laurels. I wore a white bedsheet tied into a lose chiton, brushing against my knees. My crown nestled in my dark hair, I rose, and tied a red cape about my shoulders.

Auguste kissed my cheek before stepping back and stripping out of his street clothes; instead, he pinned a purple bedsheet into place, tumbling down to his ankles, and draped his shoulders with a navy clock. I gently placed an ad-hoc wreath of plastic grape vines among his barley-gold hair, and he kissed me again.

"Hello, handsome," Auguste said. I smiled into Auguste's hair.

"Flatterer," I replied. Auguste danced away from me, picking up a small glass bottle of clear liquid. He palmed it and held up his hands, grinning at his little magic trick.

We walked to school, shivering in the wet and freezing air, and joined the other students waiting in line to get into the gym. Auguste's fingers danced across my bare forearm, humming softly.

Mr. Fall was a chaperone, the bull mask hanging around his neck. Auguste giggled into mine; I felt Fall's eyes as intently as I felt Auguste's hot breath.

"He's not even hiding," he murmured to me. "He wants us."

"He wants *you,*" I corrected, moving through the endless throngs of people. Fall's eyes never left us.

I'd be lying if I said that party was interesting  all parties are the same, too loud and full of people I didn't really care to speak to. Instead, all I could focus on was the electric tension of Fall's eyes on us, Auguste's fingers wrapped around my red right wrist. An hour more passed, and we walked by the punch bowl.

Auguste tilted the glass bottle into the bowl, and we swept ourselves away quickly, chitons swishing. From the other side of the gym, we watched Fall drink the tainted punch.

"Wait," Auguste whispered in my ear. "It's happening soon."

My hand brushed his waist, twisting the purple fabric. The music shifted, low and intense, and the lights shimmered, the crowds slowing and pressing and melting. Time dilated and stretched out, the music inching slowing through the air.

Auguste and I walked a loop around the gym and back to the punch bowl, where Fall still stood. There was a flush upon his cheeks.

"Nice costumes, boys," he told us. Auguste giggled, alluring. You could tell it was fake, if you really knew him. "Dionysus and Apollo? Very unique."

"Thank you," Auguste said. "You inspired us!"

"Mhm," I agreed. Fall grinned, feral around the edges, and it matched the grin on his bull mask.

"Well, you guys look great," Fall said.  "I'm glad you were so inspired. Are you enjoying the party?"

"Yeah," I lied. "But we're probably going back to my house to watch horror movies soon."

Auguste leaned his body against mine, and gripped my wrist. Fall watched the movement intently.

"You two be careful," he told us. "There's a murderer out there."

One was standing in front of me.

"I know," I told him, soft and serious. Fall stiffened.

Auguste gripped my cloak as we left with a handful of others, the drizzle turning into a pounding rain. Our chitons became slicked to our bodies, yet neither of us seemed to notice the cold. We walked along the sidewalk, the others falling away from us until we were alone. I know we really weren't; my hand slipped from Auguste's waist to the slit in his chiton, parting it to touch the bare skin of his thigh. Auguste laughed, arms twining around my neck and lips pressing against the corner of my jaw.

"Come on," I said loudly, and we ducked into the woods. I knew we were followed.

Auguste danced from my grip and undid his bedsheet chiton, letting it fall to the earth and reveal his nudity to the world. In the misty grays of the rainy forest, he shone white and vibrant. I followed him, stripping off my own costume and barring the twisted red of my birthmark.

"Follow me," Auguste sang, sweeter than a trilling songbird. "Follow me, follow me"

My feet were silent; the murderer's crahsed against the underbrush. He was a shadow in my vision, lured by Auguste's luring dance.

"Follow me, follow me, follow me"

I let the murderer come in front of me, the rain flowing down the valley and ridges of my body. The murderer let his mask fall to the ground, forgotten, and behind him I put it over my own face.

Auguste came upon the pond and stopped before the shore, pale and striking, the smooth line of his back to the forest. I watched as the murderer came behind him, his hands on Auguste's bare hips.

"I've caught you," Fall declared, proud. Auguste laughed like a mockingbird.

"No," he declared. From the trees, I came up behind and wrapped my arm around Fall's neck. He choked, shocked, and I dragged him from Auguste. My foot stepped down on the side of his knee with a crunch; Fall screamed and Auguste kept laughing.

I pinned him down, hands around his neck and squeezing, pushing him down into the mud. Fall's legs kicked out until Auguste sat on them, and Auguste reached around to take the bull mask off of me and put it on himself. I bent down, mouth opening, and sunk my teeth into his jugular. Auguste wrapped his arms around my shoulders. I bit down and wrench my head back, taking Fall's throat with me, and I was drenched in blood and rainwater.

"I love you," Auguste whispered into my ear. I smiled.

We didn't eat Fall's liver.

---

Mr. Fall was the fourth victim of the Woodland Butcher and over the following year, he was called the last. Perhaps in some forgotten and dusty cold case file, his intact liver is mentioned in conjunction with the other victims' lack of them.

Auguste was my homecoming and prom date, slow dancing in matching suits to the clean versions of Top 40 pop hits. Our chaste kisses taste like copper and secrets.

After high school, we were college roommates in the dorms and shitty studio apartments, never really returning to the town we met in for more than a handful of days. More and more Thanksgivings and Christmases were spent in the strange comforts of the Bellefleur-Veisis rather than being outsiders among my own family, until I woke up one day and realized I hadn't talked to my sister for a year and a half.

I didn't call her that day, either.

We have a home now, a townhouse in the city with a fireplace. Above it is a mask of a red-faced bull. Sometimes our son, dark-haired and golden-skin, will put it on.

He is whole and perfect and almost old enough for the stories so he can learn what we are like I once learned. We will teach him like how Auguste's fathers taught him and how my father should've taught me, a line of survival lessons passed on from father unto son.

The Woodland Butcher is still alive in my hometown, a half-feared demigod crowned with horns and pale hair. I lay beside him every night, and Auguste presses good morning kisses to his vivid red face.

Perhaps one day we'll stalk those woods again.

My father  or, at least, the man listed on my birth certificate  knew I wasn't his from the moment I was born, I think.

My older sister, Laura, was born with flawless skin and her father's chin, and I know Laura still has pictures of her sitting upon his shoulders. I was born marred, deformed, and my father knew I wasn't his, that I was a cuckoo bird left by another man for him to raise.

My father called me a freak and a bastard, a silent little devil that ruined playing happy little families. Daddy would yell, Daddy would drink, and I endured in the quiet way I always do. Mom wanted a divorce, Daddy called her a cheating whore and grabbed a kitchen knife.

I was six. I hid in the hallway closet and watched Daddy scream and pace in front of the door, wanting to kill the changeling masquerading as his on. Mom was bleeding in the kitchen. I was not afraid. My teeth ached, baby teeth slowly being replaced by adult ones.

When the cops came to arrest Daddy and bring Mom to the hospital, the social worker called Laura and me brave. I didn't understand why  I stayed quiet in the closet, Laura called the cops. She was asking after Daddy in tears.

As much as she loves me, I don't think she forgives me for that. We moved, and my new first grade teacher tried to molest me. We moved again, our lives uprooted because of me once more. I know Laura doesn't forgive me for that.

I am not my father's son, but sometimes I wondered if I inherited the same sort of madness  if inside me there is the same potential for violence.

I know the answer, now. I know myself in all the intimate ways men fear.

In English, Mr. Fall has us write poetry.

The wounds of Eric's death were still raw and oozing, classes muted and tearful. Mr. Fall looked upon our drawn faces and declared that day would be spent quietly writing.

"Rich sensory details add to poetry's appeal," he told us. "Write what you are feeling."

Mr. Fall understood teenagers.

Most wrote dirges to Eric, mourning songs meant to be wailed before a pyre. Eric's death, no matter how visceral, felt too remote for poetry. It's almost too far for prose. Auguste's ankle was touching mine. My pen glided across the paper.

"I hate poetry," Auguste said with a pout as we left class, our rough drafts left with Mr. Fall. "I'm bad at it."

"No one's good at everything," I told him. "Not even you."

Auguste pouted.

When we got our poems back, Mr. Fall had asked me to see him after class.

---

School had cleared out completely, the long halls empty except for Auguste and me.

"He's scoping out the competition," Auguste told me. "He's jealous of you."

I rolled my eyes. "No, he just wants to talk about poetry, I'm pretty sure."

"You're so narrow-minded," Auguste sighed, before sitting in the common room to wait for me. I went into Mr. Fall's room; he was shuffling around papers, stopping in place when he saw me.

"Hi, Leo," Mr. Fall said. "I liked your poem. It was very different from your classmates. Even Auguste's."

"Well, we're not the same person," I said, slouching down into my chair. "Auguste isn't much of a poet."

"But you are," Mr. Fall said. "Did you write it about Auguste?"

Both the dark and red halves of my face were good at hiding blushes. "...Why?"

"You two are very close."

"Yes," I replied. I did write the poem about Auguste. I didn't like how Mr. Fall looked at me, intent and calculating.

"You have a very mature style of writing," Mr. Fall said, steering the conversation to gentler waters. "There's a poetry competition, at the end of November. I think you'd do very well in it."

He handed me a flyer and I took it. It was in the larger, slightly more cosmopolitan town twenty minutes from ours; I barely made the age requirement, my seventeenth birthday on the first November.

"Thank you," I said. "I'll think about it."

When I left the classroom, Auguste was leaning against the lockers and not even bothering to hide the fact he was eavesdropping.

"I'm cold," Auguste whined. I shrugged out of my jacket and draped it around his shoulders, and he snuggled into it with a happy noise. The door to Mr. Fall's classroom slammed shut.

We walked down the hall before Auguste asked, "So was the poem about me?"

"Obviously," I said. "But I wasn't going to tell him that. It's weird."

"It's *cute,*" Auguste said, smiling so hard his cheeks were pink. "I can't believe you! I'm your muse!"

"Jesus, stop," I replied. Auguste leaned against me.

"Anyway, I think Mr. Fall wants to fuck both of us," Auguste said. "Or he thinks too much about us fucking."

"Gross."

Auguste and I hadn't had sex. We've never had sex, in fact. I always thought it was uncomfortable and degrading how the other boys would turn themselves in fools over it; Auguste viewed its promise as a means to an end, without any interest in the messy act. It was another way we fit together and another way we didn't fit with all the rest.

---

"Do you think Jack Carmike could be a serial killer?"

We were doing homework on Auguste's bed  or, at least, I was doing my homework while Auguste scrolled through Facebook and played detective.

"I mean, he wears a fedora every day," Auguste continued. "And I think he left that weirdo poem in my locker?"

"That one about your thighs?" I said. "I don't think he could do it physically, to be honest."

"Good point," Auguste agreed.

Auguste's door creaked open, and Mr. Veisi poked his head in.

It was easy to tell Alexandre Veisi was, for lack of a better term, Auguste's sperm donor  both were blond and alabaster, but Auguste's savage beauty tamed into something more aristocratic in Alexandre.

"We're making dinner," Alexandre declared. He had the hint of a French accent around his vowels. "Your father and I would like to meet the boy you've been spending all your time with."

He raised an eyebrow at the pretzel we were folded into.

"Uh," I replied intelligently.

"We're having *fesenjan*," Alexandre said, and then turned on his heel.

"Oh fuck yeah," Auguste said, stumbling out of bed.

"Did you tell them you had a boyfriend?" I asked. "Are they cool with it?"

Auguste stared at me.

"No," he said slowly. "My two gay dads are totally not cool with my boyfriend."

"You know what I mean," I grumbled. I tried to straighten myself some before Auguste dragged me downstairs.

The thing about the Veisis is the air of effortless perfection.

Alexandre Veisi was an art dealer. Cyrus Veisi taught history at the University of Washington. Their house was decorated like a magazine, yet warm and lived in. They were gorgeous and charming, the sons the same. It was one thing to spend time in Auguste's radiance, but another to be surrounded by his family and their brilliance.

And I  misshapen thing, cast out from everywhere, alone from my birth  felt strangely accepted.

Doctor Cyrus Veisi, a tall man with skin like polished bronze, brought out a chicken stew spooned over white rice and decorated with the seeds of a pomegranate. He served me with a glass of deep red wine.

"I'm going to assume you've partaken before," Cyrus told me. "And I'd rather you'd partake around responsible adults."

"Thank you, sir," I said. Cyrus's eyes were the color of a flat sea before a tsunami, and they sliced right through into me.

"Such a polite boy," Alexandre said. "How did you get saddled with Auguste?"

Auguste pouted. We ate, the chicken infused with the taste of pomegranates.

"What do your parents do?" Alexandre asked me.

"My mom is a tax attorney," I said, and then without input from my brain, "My dad's in prison."

Cyrus made a calculating noise  not judgmental, just processing. Auguste squeezed my leg. "That's rough for a young man, navigating this world without a mentor."

"Life can be difficult without guidance," Alexandre said mildly. "Someone to help you understand yourself."

Once, Auguste and I went into the city for a day, and as we sat in a coffee shop, men kept sending him drinks in hopes of catching his attentions. He would laugh at them, like all their efforts were the most pathetic things in the world. And why wouldn't he think that, a being of milk and honey promises that could drive men to madness. Was he born like this, or was he taught?

Alexandre smiled like melting chocolate.

"I've never really been a good son," I said. Cyrus tilted his head.

"You're young," he told me. "You can't know that yet."

We talked about the nature of gods in English class as we explored their stories  what makes someone a god rather than a mortal man? Their values, their relationships, their immortality?

I thought that we all have the potential to become so great and terrible only blood can sate us  perhaps gods were just beings that understood themselves without the lies and vanities of men. If we come to understand ourselves at our purest, become something concentrated and raw and *real,* we would become creatures of ichor instead of blood.

It was raining on the night we discovered the Woodland Butcher.

Our stomachs were full of animal and pomegranate, and fat droplets bogged down the pine branches so they bowed to us. We didn't wear jackets. The raindrops were diamonds in Auguste's hair, his feet caked in mud.

We went into the woods hand-in-hand and fearless, barefoot and water-drenched. I felt drunk, the edges of me hazy, and I knew that Auguste was me and I was Auguste, one being in two bodies. Auguste, pale haired, led me into the woods, to the pond, to the water and to the trees. We hid behind them when we heard the sound of rending meat.

Auguste's hair tickled my chin as we leaned over to look, the rain shattering the pond like bullets on glass. Beside the muddy waterside stood a bare-chested creature wearing the face of a vivid red bull with twisting black horns. Below him, supplicating and dead, was a pale youth, his blood slicking across the undergrowth and the bull's chest.

We watched, curious, as the bull tore into the youth with his hands, his intestines tossed out across the clearing like trash. His chest heaved, and before us the bull lifted up the mask and became a man, a man we knew  Mr. Fall, panting and crazed. He knelt down in the grass and muck, hand digging through the youth's belly and ripped out the youth's liver, biting into it and letting the liquid run down his chin.

Before us, Fall ate the youth's whole liver and then left the body for the scavengers to find, melting into the forest opposite us. We stepped out from behind the trees, gathering around the corpse.

"It's Terry Lyle," Auguste murmured. The captain of the soccer team; he had slipped his number to Auguste the other day. "Mr. Fall killed him."

"Mr. Fall is the Butcher," I said, and my words made it true, the trees the only witness. "He's eating them."

"We know," Auguste said. "Only we know."

He looked at me with bright, tricky eyes.

We didn't go to the cops, Terry Lyle's guts up to our ankles. It didn't even cross our minds. We knew what Mr. Fall wanted  to gorge himself on milk and honey like he gorged himself on liver.

Auguste kissed me, chaste, on the mouth. We knew what we had to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speaking as a gay trans man, people who look like me are not treated well in any genre, but especially horror. When queer characters magically show up, they are often the gay best friend doomed to die. I can't think of a single trans character in a mainstream horror film, and if there is, they were probably dead before the half way point. We, to put it bluntly, are not treated well.

Probably some of the greatest comments about my stories are all the private messages I receive thanking me for writing explicitly queer characters and that I inspired them to write their own (I've been promised so many murderous lesbians!) The worst are comments asking me why I write exclusively queer characters, which I would not receive if I was writing straight one - like, fuck me because I write characters who look like me, it's making the straight audience uncomfortable!

It's very, very annoying, but I keep hoping that some young LGBTA+ youth is going to see my shit and be inspired to write their own stories, because that's the only way the horror culture is going to change. </TEXT>

The funeral for Jackson Karl, the first known victim of the still unrealized Woodland Butcher, was held a week before school started. Our whole class was there.

It was overcast and humid, a sea of black and bowed bodies gathered around a hole underneath a pearl gray sky. The women were lamenting, the men mournfully stoic. Auguste had a mouth like a cat, always pointed upwards and unsuited for frowning, and our fingers brushed as we stood in the back.

People looked at us like they expected us to cry the hardest as they shared nonsense stories about Jackson, just because we knew what his insides looked like. The people telling the most stories about Jackson, I noted, were the ones who liked him least in life.

"When I die, I'm going to make so many new friends," Auguste murmured into my ear as they filled the hole with dirt. I had to turn my snort into a cough.

Eventually, the mourning crowd dissipated back into the September day, and Jackson was left to rot under the earth. Life turned on. School was starting soon.

---

Auguste and I had Creative Writing together after lunch, and it was agony not to hold his hand as we walked through the crowded halls.

The teacher had put the desks in a circle, and on his own there was a bust of a beautiful man crowned with grapevines. Auguste and I sat next to each other, knees pressed tight as we talked in low voices. Auguste's hair kept falling into his eyes, and I wanted to brush it away in a raw sort of way. Auguste had almond shaped eyes, bright and dazzling as he deliberately ignored everyone trying to catch them. He held the attention of the whole room without a word and didn't care at all.

There is no one quite like Auguste.

He leaned over to me to whisper in my ear, cupping his hand to cover his rosy mouth, "Maggie Castelo is holding a party on Saturday. It'll be boring if you don't come."

"Yeah?" I replied, but the other things I was going to say died when the teacher walked into the room.

Mr. Fall was young and scruffy in an attractive way, glasses slipping down his nose and leather elbow patches on his blazer. The girl next to me let out a dreamy sigh, and I filed the information away because it was the sort of thing Auguste liked to mock.

He sat a stack of papers down on his desk before smiling at us. Auguste moved to sit forward, but he still had his ankle hooked with mine. The touch was comforting.

"Hello, everyone!" Mr. Fall said cheerfully. "I'm so excited to join your school. Now I majored in both English and Classical Studies, so we'll pull a lot of stories from Greek myth"

I wasn't paying attention. Auguste's fingers were tracing nonsense patterns across the fake wood of the desk. He might've been telling me some secret.

"now let us go around the room and say our name and our favorite Greek god."

He was aiming for a quirking sort of cool. It was working. I spoke before Auguste.

"I'm Leo," I said, like everyone didn't know me by my birthmark. "And I guess Dionysus? He's got some cool stories."

"He's mine, too," Mr. Fall said, pointing at the bust. "We'll read the *Bacchae* later this year."

Then Mr. Fall's gaze snapped to Auguste. Everyone's did. He smiled like he knew something hidden.

"My name is Auguste," he said, sweeter than sugar. He tapped his bottom lip as he considered, and the movement was hypnotic. "And I'd have to say Apollo. I like poetry, and he's associated with poetry, right?"

He looked at me, and I blushed at the memory of reading him all my terrible love poems. Auguste smiled wider. Mr. Fall's face was unreadable until the next person spoke, and he smiled again.

We walked together out of class, the last out, and Auguste ran his thumb over the knob of my wrist before the door swung shut.

"Mr. Fall is jealous of you," Auguste sing-songed as we walked.

"Is he?" I asked. I was an easy person to be jealous of.

"Mhm," Auguste murmured. His charcoal lashes spread across his high cheekbones. "Everyone is going to be jealous of you. They should be."

I just smiled at him, bumping his shoulder before we had to part. The crowds parted for Auguste, and no one looked at him dead on for the same reason people don't look directly at solar eclipses.

We came together again at the end of the day so I could drive Auguste home in my battered Subaru.

"I can't believe you own such a dad car," Auguste said as he clamored into the passenger seat. "It's like you should be driving me to soccer practice."

I groaned. "Please don't make the joke"

"What joke, *Daddy?*" Auguste asked innocently, before bursting out laughing at my expression.

"Little asshole," I grumbled at him, throwing my backpack in the trunk.

"I'm going to assume the new kid is blind."

I turned to look at the big truck parked across from me, where the lacrosse captain Eric Lawrence and all his friends were standing. My brow furrowed  for all his frat bro tendencies, Eric was never a huge dick to anyone.

"Why else would he hang around you?" he finished, proud. Auguste leaned out the door, cat smile upon his face, and his eyes crawled up and down Eric's frame. He puffed out his chest, grinning.

"I have great eyesight," Auguste declared, and then went back inside the car, door slamming shut behind him. I got into the driver's seat as Eric deflated.

"Auguste, just ignore him," I told him. "I've been dealing with dicks my whole life."

Auguste pouted. "But he was mean to you. Friends defend each other."

"Yeah?" I said, smiling despite myself. "We're friends?"

Auguste settled his hand over mine where it sat on the gear shift, and didn't move for the entire drive home.

---

On Saturday, the weather was cooling rapidly as it realized it was finally autumn, and the threat of a drizzle hung in the air. In my bedroom, I opened up my window and popped open the screen, shimmering down to the ground. It was ten and my mother was asleep in front of the TV; Auguste lived two streets down from me. The cold and wet air broke my skin out in goosebumps, and I tightened my leather jacket around myself.

Auguste had said, rather flippantly, that his dads were out on date night and didn't really care about what he did. Doctor and Mister Veisi seemed to realize stopping Auguste from doing what he wanted was a fruitless endeavor.

I knocked on the door of their beautiful home, and a GQ model opened the door  dark skin to match his tousled hair, sharp stubbled jaw, and tall nose. He looked at me, I looked at him, and he arched a perfect brow.

"You must be the boyfriend," Auguste's brother said. "Auguste won't shut the fuck up about you. Leo, right? I'm Julien."

Julien let me into the house, leading me with long strides to the living room. He tossed himself on to an artfully messy white couch. "Auguste is busy preening."

"...Why?" I asked. The thought of Auguste looking anything less than good was...weird. A little unsettling. It's hard to explain.

"Because he's a vain motherfucker?" Julien offered. His phone was buzzing; the bored swipe of his thumb told me he was on Tinder and was very picky. "I come home for the weekend to visit my family and they all fuck off to be romantic."

I snorted despite myself  while they looked completely different, Julien spoke with the same flippant, melodramatic tone Auguste did. I liked him.

"Did you know that Auguste used to not respond when Papa called him by name?" Julien said suddenly. "He learned that he was named after the Emperor Augustus and refused to responded to anything other than *Princeps* for weeks"

"JULIEN!"

Auguste stomped down the stairs wearing a pair of very deliberately ripped jeans, He plastered himself to my side, and I hugged his waist.

"You're going to freeze when you're standing on the street corner," Julien mused. Auguste stuck out his tongue at him.

"I want to go now," Auguste told me plaintively. "I'm sick of Julien."

"Wow," Julien said dryly. "Leave me here to die alone."

Auguste tugged me out of the door, and when we stepped out into the street, I hugged him close. He made a happy noise. The night seemed quiet and empty, the silence echoing through the trees, and I became hyperaware of how the needled branches of the trees rustled in the wind. Every noise was a threat, and I half listened to Auguste's gossip as I moved him deeper into the safety of my arms.

Maggie's house was on the edge of town, her backyard slowly becoming the woods, and I felt relief when I saw the gaggle of cars and the muffled thumps of music. Auguste left my arms to bounce up the steps, and I followed sedately behind.

The party was in full swing when we stepped inside, the hallways lit by the eerie glow of Christmas lights. The colors formed raindrops on Auguste's ivory skin and glittered in his hair, blurring the edges of him until he became unreal. The music was rhythmic and hypnotic, lulling me to someplace else.

Auguste stepped into the kitchen, in front of a line of liquor and wine, pouring us both wine in a little plastic cups.

"Cheers," I murmured, and we tapped our cups together before drinking. The wine stained Auguste's mouth red, and all of him was vivid and hazy all at once, an impression of something beautiful and terrifying

"Auguste! You made it!"

We were swarmed with followers, entranced by Auguste's effortless charm. I stood behind him like a long shadow, immensely fond as Auguste regaled the gathering crowd with impossible stories. When he turned to look at me with playful eyes, my smile was so wide I thought it would split my face.

Eventually, Auguste got sick of the others and dragged me to where the crowd could swallow us. Our fingers were gently entwined as we stood in front of a great bay window that overlooked Maggie's backyard and the woods. The contrast between the artificial Christmas lights and the soft moonlight was strange, casting us in two halves; in this odd twilight, I looked white and Auguste looked red. I almost told him this, but the woods made my words catch in my throat.

The soft breeze made the trees dance, high against the velvety sky, and the darkness between the trunks gave me pause. It seemed to *shift,* becoming a creature of sinew and shadow, and some primordial instinct deep inside me yelled to grab Auguste and go. I almost did.

The body of Eric Lawrence smacked against the window, loud and wet.

There was a rope tied around his ankles, and he had been tossed off the balcony. What was once in his ribcage and belly spilled down to the porch and splattered across the window. I pulled Auguste close to me, tucking him into my jacket and covering his face.

People were screaming. I stood there in surprise. Eric swung, propelled by the breeze.

"The cops are coming here," I said. "We should go."

Auguste agreed.

It was easy to slip out of the panicking house and to hide behind a hedge until the sirens wailed by. We walked back to Auguste's house, taking the stairs two at a time to his room. I don't know where Julien was.

I took off my shoes and jacket before sitting on Auguste's bed, and he clamored into my neck, arms around my neck.

"There's a serial killer," Auguste said, and giggled. "Oh gosh."

"Only you would laugh about that," I said fondly, tracing patterns across his back. "But yes, there probably is."

"We probably know them."

Auguste looked up at me with glinting eyes.

"We have to know them, right?" Auguste said. "They're killing people we know. We know a murderer."

"What does a murderer look like?" I asked.

"They look like everyone else," Auguste said, before bursting into even more giggles.

He fell asleep, soft and sweet, in my arms and his breath tickled my neck, but I couldn't sleep.

I did know what a murderer looked like. They look like my father. </TEXT>

Whenever people learn where I'm from, they want to know about the Woodland Butcher.

It's not the first question people ask me  that distinction belongs to my birthmark.

They don't ask with their voices, but with how their eyes traced the lines forming a handprint over the right of my face. There, the palm on my cheek and the thumb bisecting my mouth like a harelip, the index and middle fingers slicing across my dark eyes and into my dark hairline, and the wrist trailing down until it covered half of my body. It's crimson, vivid against the golden tones of my skin, and no one could look away when I walked down the street.

My mother said it was because an angel held me real tight before I was born. My classmates considered me cursed, and my father agreed with them. Auguste thinks it makes me beautiful.

I can't talk about the Woodland Butcher without talking about Auguste. I can't talk about myself without talking about Auguste. All three of us are tied up together in ways the true crime novels could never detangled, if they could even find the ends. They all weigh heavy on me.

I'm going to tell you about the Woodland Butcher. But first, Auguste. And summer.

---

The summer before my junior year of high school was a rolling boil.

The air hung like a wet wool blanket and you drank it in instead of breathing it. The neat asphalt roads of my sleepy little town were melting, and the carefully manicured lawns of the two and three story track houses were turning brown. The forest surrounded us, engulfed us, and filled the air with the scent of dried pine.

At the end of town, right before a trailhead that wound its way through the trees, was a 7-11 that I used to walk to in the mornings before it got too hot. I'd fill up my backpack with snacks and then fuck off into the woods to read poetry and avoid my cavernous, echoing house  my mother made partner a month earlier, and my sister had elected to spend summer at her college town. The woods weren't so deafening.

That July day, one of many slow ones that unfurled after the clamor of the Fourth, seemed like any other. I made my trek, freckles blossoming across my broad shoulders, and the air condition of the 7-11 blasted me in the face and irritated my eyes. I nodded at the bored cashier and started weaving my way through the aisles.

Auguste was in the magazine aisle, which seemed like a stupid place to meet someone like him, but I rounded the corner and stopped to gape at him standing there, all the colors of milk and honey. His golden hair brushed against his shoulders and his face was carved from alabaster, almond-shaped eyes made of emerald. I had never seen a boy like Auguste, and when he looked up at me, bright and beautiful, he smiled widely.

"Hello," he said cheerfully. "I'm Auguste, I just moved into the neighborhood."

"Leo," I replied. There was a weird, giddy feeling in my chest as Auguste stepped closer to me, pale and perfect. "It's nice to meet you."

Auguste giggled as if charmed. If love had a sound, it would be that.

Auguste was a creature meant for summer, meant for walking through the woods and having the sunlight illuminate the silhouette of his body through his thin tank top. The world felt quiet when he'd turn and look behind him, aristocratic fingers reaching out to tangle in my own. This experience, this youthful joy at touching and loving another, was so fresh and new to me I felt helpless to resist him.

Long summer days passed like that, meeting Auguste at the convenience store and heading out into the woods, laughter always bubbling out of our mouth. Auguste would trace the edges of my birthmark and place kisses on my brow, sweet and chaste, and I would teach him about Byron and the names for all the trees. We were young and in love in a delirious way, drunk on learning everything about each other.

"This place doesn't have any stories," Auguste told me. My head was in his lap as we lounged beside the pond, hidden so deep inside the woods no one from the outside could find it.

"It has one," I told him. Before the end of the year, it would have two.

---

There is a story about these woods, and we were told it every Halloween.

When the white settlers came, the indigenous people told them that these woods were already settled by a spirit crowned with antlers, and this spirit jealously guarded its domain from all outsiders. Like they always do in these stories, the white men did not listen.

In the night, a beautiful maiden would appear to one of the settlers and lure him into the woods. In the morning, the rest would find the man torn to pieces, a look of ecstasy upon his face.

There were seven settlers and so the maiden appeared for six nights, until only one man  always mysteriously immune to her charms  remained on the seventh. Terrified, he waited with his rifle as the beautiful maiden came to him with long pale hair and crooned to him. She tried to draw him from the safety of the fire, but when he didn't listen to her sweet songs, she transformed in front of him.

Her body became tall and spindly, her skin a vivid red, and her pale hair twisted into a crown of antlers. Her sweet mouth opened into a vast chasm of teeth, and it ate the bullets the terrified man shot at it before he ran from the camp.

It chased after him so closely that the man could feel the hot breath of the spirit on the back of his neck, and it followed him all the way to where the natives dwelled, stopping right at the edge where the woods led to their village. It could not cross into civilization from the wild, and the man, it is said, never left the Native village for the rest of his days out of fear of it.

An activist told this story when a property group tried to push the boundaries of the town deeper into the woods. Three days later, the inspector demarking the subdivision was found mauled and shredded, and all development halted. Our town remained the same size it always has.

I was in the third grade, and everyone was convinced the monster was me because we both had red sin. This backfired on the head bully  my older sister and I crept into the woods right outside his backyard, and she held me on her shoulders as I held up cardboard antlers. We could hear his screams of terror from our spot, and ran away laughing before his father could find us.

"He never talked about it again," I told Auguste. His fine-boned fingers traced around my birthmark and across the bridge of my prominent nose.

"I know who to call upon to frighten my enemies away," Auguste murmured. His hair was like spun sunlight. My whole body felt warm. The summer had gone on for what felt like years.

Summers always die.

The sounds of crashing undergrowth announced the arrival of the elite to the pond, carrying towels and wearing bathing suits. I lurched up and tugged Auguste with me, intent on getting out of their as quickly as possible.

"What" Auguste said, right as Jackson Karl called out, "Look what we found!"

Jackson Karl was the quarterback, his father an executive and his mother a doctor. I suppose you can imagine what his smug face looked like.

"Come on," I murmured to Auguste. "Let's go somewhere else."

"But who are your friends, Leo?" Auguste asked me. His fingers were wrapped loosely around my wrist, and Jackson zeroed in on them immediately.

"Why are you hanging out with this loser?" Jackson asked, which was much different than what I expected  his tone was jealous instead of hateful. "Surely someone like you could do better."

Auguste scoffed and leaned up to my ear to whisper loudly, "Let's go to my house, Leo."

Jackson flushed a vivid, embarassed red as we left laughing. I didn't understand why for months.

We found the body a week later.

---

August was ending, the junior year on the horizon, and my own Auguste walked in front of me, leading me by the hand through the trees. I don't remember what we were talking about. We've talked about so many things.

The woods around us were silent, the trees as serious as temple pillars, and Auguste's hair glittered in the sun, pale skin glowing like alabaster. Before we stepped into the clearing, Auguste turned to laugh at me. I forget why. Things felt soft-focused and unreal, gauzy fabric pulled taunt across my eyes. I loved him in the gentle press of fingertips and closed lips in stolen moments.

The lines of the clearing were very stark, the colors so bright they felt unnatural. We stopped on the edge of it, Auguste pressed into my side, and dawned matching shocked expressions.

"Oh," Auguste said. We had never seen a dead body before.

There was Jackson, or at least half of him, his torso and head protruding out of the water. His blood was a red oil slick across the water, his ribcage torn upon so all his insides were outside and filled the clear with the smell of sun-rotted meat. His eyes were wide and glassy, yet his expression was one of a saint experiencing religious ecstasy.

We turned back to the 7-11 and called the cops. When they came, we led them through the quiet wood side by side and didn't touch each other. The cops told us to go home after we guided them to the pond. I wondered out loud if corpses could cause algae blooms, and Auguste hid his giggles into my shoulder; people thought he was crying.

Everyone knew Jackson was dead and that we found him before we reached the road, and they stared at us with wide gazes. No one spoke a word to us, as if seeing death marked us even more as outsiders. I didn't feel any different  maybe vaguely sad Dr. Karl had to see her son like that, but I wasn't upset over the body nor did I care about Jackson being dead. I didn't even really think about him unless the therapist my mom made me go to brought it up; my lack of response discomforted her greatly.

Auguste thought about it the same as me, but his parents never made him go to a therapist. Dr. and Mr. Veisi understood when Auguste needed help, and Auguste needed help as often as he cried.

Jackson was the first corpse, and the first victim of what they'd later name the Woodland Butcher. I didn't know that yet. I didn't know anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My father's line has always produced sons.

From my father I got my pale hair and my sharp jaw and how I could pull anyone my way with a smile and a wink. My father has never worked a day unless it was on his back, and yet we were all swaddled in Louis Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent. He could steal a man's fortune in a single conversation, and he taught us all the same. It's the nature of our kind, half survival and half sport.

My brothers were content to play at housecats when they were lions, but it was always hard for me to hide my irritation at the teeming masses of humanity. Instead of expensive clubs, I went to academia and rejected my father's offers of sugar daddies and escort gigs. I got a real job and learned how to survive like mortal men did.

One of things I learned was that premade food was a ripoff, and that making my own feasts was far better. Making my own took more time, yes, but if my minimum wage job was any indication my time wasn't worth much anyway. 

Sundays were spent making bread and chili, soups and stews, and then I'd freeze portions for the coming week. I taught myself about spices and flavors to add a little life to my bland meals, and punching dough soothed the week's built up irritation. My little studio apartment became a kingdom of solitude where I could drop the mask and not have to deal with everyone who thought themselves entitled to my affections.

I live like this, quiet and serene, until my junior year. In that year, two vital things happened  I officially declared my neuroscience major, and Doctor Erikson became my advisor.

His office was in the newest building on campus, its clear pane windows and wooden beams showing how modern and youthful he was. Doctor Erikson worked out, wore glasses, and cracked jokes, so everyone wanted his dick. I just wanted a flow chart to medical school or perhaps a PhD program. Erikson couldn't stop touching my leg, praising my intelligence, giving sly compliments to my appearance, and I gritted my teeth and endured as I have so often before.

"I hope to have you in my classes, Jack," Erikson purred at the end of our advising session, like he was the first professor who wanted to fuck me. Animal.

Most professors learned to clamp down on their desires by the second cool dismissal, but perhaps Erikson was too emboldened by the ardent desires of his freshmen students to back down. To him, I was just a haughty student that needed to be worn down to accept his lust.

First came the coveted research position in his lab group; my lab mates resented me until I, blessedly, took over the dirty task of giving mice schizophrenia. Then, Erikson started to find more and more reasons to come by my lab table, leering and looming over me as I tried to work. Anonymous gifts of flowers and poetry. Odd excuses for advising sessions. Wandering hands. I endured with the patience of a stone, drawing Erikson closer and closer. It was a dance my father taught me, and he didn't let me leave the nest until I memorized all the steps.

It all came to a crescendo on Saturday.

I was the only one in the lab, looking over the blood tests I had started the Friday before. The quiet whirling of computers and the chattering of mice was interrupted by Erikson opening the door with a creak. I acknowledged him with a hum; his hands slid on to my shoulders, fingers brushing against my pale neck.

"No one would question it if you stepped down from your position," Erikson threatened. "This is a stressful role for an undergraduate."

"I'm not stressed, Doctor," I said neutrally. Erikson squeezed his hands around my biceps.

"It's okay to be weak, Jack," Erikson whispered, his breath humid on the back of my neck. "Let me help you *relax.*"

I made a choice. I took Erikson by the hand and led him to my apartment.

He laid upon my crisp white sheets and watched me undressed down to my unmarred skin. I stripped him bare and sat on his lap, kissing him with my rosy mouth. It was easy to make him think I loved him back, and he sung my praises between my thighs like they were a temple. He clutched at me like I was his possession, like he had the right to bruise me.

Afterwards, Erikson rested on his back and I watched him recover. He would not be satisfied by a single night, no one ever was.

I used one of my parring knives  a gift from my father  to stab Erikson between the ribs, into the lungs. He gasped, sputtering, still riding the high of the afterglow, and I cradled his head in my lap as he died, singing sweet songs as his eyes grew glassy.

Erikson was a big, heavy weight in my bed, but if college taught me anything it was "waste not, want not." I had never slaughtered an animal before, and as I laid out the plastic tarp in my living room, I had never been so eager to learn something new.

I did the butchering naked, because my father said the first kill you did was better naked. Said it was better than sex, to which I always responded that sex was always boring at best  however, as I dismantled Erikson into something useful, completely drenched in his blood, I understood what father meant.

As Saturday night turned into Sunday morning, I had torn Erikson to the bones and my freezer was bursting with meat that promised weeks and weeks of meals. I boiled some of his bones for stock, even made the heart and lung into sausage, though the rest of the organs and bones were left for the other animals to take.

Some might consider this cannibalism, but I contend Erikson and I aren't really the same species  how could you explain my kind as anything other than a predator, camouflaged in his beauty? We don't call leopards cannibals for eating zebra just because they are both mammals.

My distressed lab mates, eating the pig stew I so graciously brought in during the search for Doctor Erikson? Oh, they definitely were. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The gold around my finger pulls me deeper than an anchor.

My lover's name is Sebastian, and God granted him the sort of looks people spent millions trying to recreate in silicon and plastic. His face is peerless, with a wide smiling mouth and big aquamarine blue eyes. I wake up every morning to that mouth upon my forehead, those big eyes staring down upon me, and a limber body curled beside my own.

Idyllic, people would say with laughter and jealousy. They would not understand why I did what I did. They would not understand what it means to love someone like Sebastian. This is what I will tell you.

Before I worked homicide, I worked sex crimes. I found it draining, like a leech upon my back  at least in homicide, the victim is not staring at you from a hospital bed, stumbling through how their boyfriend held them down in the back of a car. At least in homicide the prosecutor isn't asking me what the girl was wearing, like she somehow deserved her fate. At least in homicide, the victim is dead and gone and free and that seemed like a better destiny than some of the shit I saw.

This is where I met Sebastian.

This happens more often than you'd think, but you'd fluff it up, try to wait until the case was fully closed, and say you ran into each other later. Some guys have a hero complex, obsessed with the idea of protecting someone terrified and vulnerable. I always said that I wasn't going to pick someone up at a crime scene. I was, and always am, a fucking liar.

I pulled up to ambulance flashing and beat cops taping off the front of a cute little house, the big bay window up front completely smashed in. Point of entry automatically established, I went to go find my victim sitting in the ambulance.

Even here, huddled underneath a bright orange shock blanket with only the streetlamps for lighting, Sebastian seemed to glow from the inside out. There were freckles across his aristocratic nose, and his legs were long and covered in bruises. I slapped myself for noticing when there were thick tears still dripping down his face.

"Hey, are you Sebastian?" I asked kindly. He looked up at me with those jewel blue peepers. "I'm Detective Anthony Capri. Can you tell me what happened?"

"I was...I was just in my kitchen, making dinner," Sebastian murmured. He spoke like birdsong, sugar sweet trills that would lull me awake on my mornings off. "I heard shattering glass from my living room, and when I came out to see what broke, he...he..."

Sebastian broke off. I placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, and Sebastian looked up at me with pleading adoration. I was used to a bit of hero worship, my towering frame and square-cut jaw filling the role of Knight in Shining Armor easily.

"He pinned me down and tried to..." Sebastian said. It was oftentimes difficult for male victims to fully articulate what happened to them, too ashamed to admit weakness. "But the cops came before he could..."

"It's alright," I assured. "Do you think it was someone you know?"

Sebastian looked down, before casting a baleful look at me through his lashes. "I have an ex-boyfriend. He was very...violent."

Sebastian, of course, came down to the station on multiple occasions, to give an official witness statement and sit with the police sketch artist and talk about his violent ex-boyfriend. I was always there, as the lead detective on the case, and Sebastian  bright and vivacious and playful  would smile and say that he found my presence comforting. I made him feel safe and secure, even as we struggled to locate his ex-boyfriend.

I was there when he opened the threatening note taped to his door, written in the ex's shattered scrawl, and I held Sebastian as he sobbed into my chest.

"I don't think I'll ever be free of him," Sebastian confessed. "He's going to always find me and...and..."

"You can stay at my place tonight," I said, without thinking. Unprofessional, like those cops with victim fetishes and hero complexes. I stroked Sebastian's soft hair, and he looked up at me with unfettered adoration.

My bachelor pad, a two story house that backed up on to some woods out on the edge of town, was transformed by Sebastian's presence. Instead of frozen pizzas he made me steak; instead of silence, he dragged out my old record collection and made me dance with him. I was still laughing when he pressed me down on to the couch, and he trilled like a little bird when we made love on my lonely bed. I curled around him like a bulletproof vest, his fine-boned fingers stretched across my ribs, and I had never felt more wanted.

"What if every night was like this one?" he asked me. "How wonderful would it be?"

No part of me could disagree with him, and I fell asleep in love.

I woke up to shattering glass and Sebastian not coddled in my arms, and was immediately on the offensive. I pulled on my pants and grabbed my service weapon, making my way downstairs. The huge floodlights at the front of my house made eerie silhouettes of the living room. Sebastian stood there naked with his ex-boyfriend kneeling with his head against Sebastian's knees, strange shadow puppets in the washed-out dark. The stranger was crying.

Sebastian turned to me, eyes so bright, and said, "He won't let me go."

I don't know why I did what I did. What possessed me to put my gun between this man's eyes and pull the trigger, splattering his brain across my wall. Why I went and dragged that body into the woods, burying it in a shallow grave for the scavengers to pick over and for the wind to scatter the bones. Why I let Sebastian kiss me when I came back, a smile upon his mouth.

"I knew you were the right one for me," Sebastian whispered to me, and it was like a wedding vow.

I still see the man's shadow when I drink my morning coffee, a stranger among the trees. Sebastian walks around our kitchen, chattering about surrogate candidates and filling our home with blue-eyed, silver-tongued babies as beautiful as he is. Between us is a secret heavier than lead and more binding than gold.

Sometimes I wonder who got the better destiny. </TEXT>

<TITLE> For Beautiful Things </TITLE>

<TEXT> I think about beauty a lot.

I've always been an artistic child, according to my mom, far more willing to sit and color with crayons than run outside, always straying outside the lines of coloring books. My parents put me into art classes and camps starting when I was five. While I played around with a lot of mediums and a lot of styles, by the time of junior year my specialty was oil paint and people.

*Neo-Renaissance*, my art teacher called it. I was obsessed with capturing the human form  all the perfect muscles, sinew, hair, and skin that makes us us. People are beautiful, either gloriously or tragically, and I loved to capture that. Human beauty deserved to live on forever.

While AP Studio Art and the building up of my art school profile was my main focus junior year, I was also starting on my third year of French. France was a culture that seemed to share my love of beautiful things, right down to the aesthetics of its language, and seemed like the right choice. That was the class where I first met Ash.

It was in November when we all piled in, taking off the coats and scarves that signaled the coming of winter, and I noticed that Madame Elis was not here yet. She ended up coming in right as the bell rung, and perfection followed behind her.

He was slender with skin like ivory and perfect ebony curls that fell in front of a face people would die for. His eyes were big and dove gray, framed by charcoal lashes, and he kept them downcast. I had the irrational urge to run up to him and make him laugh and smile with that red, red mouth.

"We have a new student, everyone," Madame Elis said. Everyone was staring at the new boy in wide-eyed wonderment. "Please introduce yourself."

"I'm Achille Bellefleur," he spoke like a singing bell. "But you can call me Ash."

*Bellefleur.* Beautiful flower. A perfect name for a boy with lips like an English rose.

"Now you speak some French already, Ash?" Madame Elis asked. Ash nodded, curls bouncing.

"My grand-pre is from Cannes," Ash said, and from those scant few words I could hear the melodic thrum of his flawless accent. "He taught me. I wasn't formally taught, however."

"We're all here to learn. Please sit next to Isaac, over there."

*I* was Isaac. Ash moved with grace and sat on the little metal chair like a throne.  He looked up at me through the curtain of lashes and smiled, piercing me straight to the core. I think that's the point I fell in love.

Ash became instantly popular with a flutter of his lashes and a giggling laugh, and yet he still hung out with me. I remember dreaming about us in Paris in a little apartment and spending rainy mornings wrapped up together, and shared it with him.

"Paris would love you, Isaac," Ash would tell me. "Paris loves artists."

And I loved Ash with feverous devotion, his closed-mouth smile and cool gray gaze filling up my canvases and risqu anatomical sketches of his back and legs dotting my notebooks. We kept it hidden how he'd chastely kiss me when we were the only ones in the art room and spend weekend afternoons curled up together on my bed.

Ash wore adoration like a crown of laurels, made his high cheeks flush pink and his soft lips stretch wide. No matter how hard we tried, we couldn't hide our young romance, and people are hateful at the best of times, more so when they were jealous.

And Jacob Wilcox was a jealous guy.

Jake, to put it bluntly, was the villain from every teen comedy  star quarterback, captain of the football team, dating the head cheerleader while sleeping with the rest of the team. Unlike in a teen comedy, I didn't give two shits and he didn't notice the art nerd...until Ash spent time with me and not him.

It's stupid to think all homophobes are secretly gay or whatever, but there was no other explanation of why Jake would call me a faggot while mooning over Ash. He never went anywhere with Ash  Ash would just stare at him with that cool gray gaze until Jake got the message. It never seemed to stick, however, and when my house was egged and graffitied, it was certain Jake needed to face serious consequences.

"I know it was him, but the cops can't prove it," I said to Ash over the phone. Ash made a considering noise.

"Come over tonight, at around eleven," Ash said, voice low and flirtatious. "I know how to make it better."

We hadn't gone all the way yet, and the thought of a midnight rendezvous had me coming around early. Ash greeted me at his back door wearing a white shirt so thin I could see the bare skin beneath, and he danced out of the reach of my wandering hands.

"Down, down," he urged me, dragging it into his basement. I questioned why we were going down here since Ash's room was upstairs, but teenage lust quickly overwhelmed rational thought. When we were at the bottom of the steps, Ash turned to me and said, "Close your eyes."

I did, and Ash guided me. He let go of my hand, and I imagined opening my eyes to a lover's nest, Achille naked in front of me, and we would spend the whole night wrapped up in each other.

"Now open them, Isaac."

I did, and took a step back in shock.

Plastic had been laid out on the concrete floor, underneath a metal morgue slab, and bound down on the slab with plastic and rope was Jacob. He was gagged, making muffled noises of distress.

"Told you I'd make you feel better, Isaac," Ash said, spreading his hands across my chest. "He tried to fuck me, Isaac, but I don't want him. I want you."

"What are you" I stumbled over my words. Ash pulled away for a moment to slide off his shirt, revealing beautiful and unblemished skin. "How could you"

"No one can get between us," Ash promised. He hugged me around the neck. "We're meant to be, Isaac, and this *pig* can't change it."

He kissed me, slow and sweet, and slipped a knife into my hand. When he pulled away he murmured, "Don't worry, my papa showed me what to do."

It was me who let out the first blood, splattering across the plastic, but Ash landed the killing blow, a slash across the throat that drenched him in red. It dripped down his white skin and over his English rose mouth, and he had never been more beautiful. We made love together on the plastic, below Jacob's cooling corpse, and I had never known such ecstasy before. When his father found us in the basement, he just shook his head and taught us how to clean up a body.

Achille's line, the aristocratic French blood passed from father unto son, has been doing this sort of thing for a long time.

Tonight, as I sit in the car in front of a little suburban house, that line was going to continue. Ash is inside that house, my hands are white knuckle on the steering wheel. We have three tickets for Paris  for me, for Ash, and for the little boy Ash is carrying in his arms. There is blood on Ash's hands.

I know what I am going to paint next. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Re: monsters.

If it's a supernatural creature such as a demon, "Fuck You That's Why" is a perfectly good explanation for its behavior. Supernatural evil exists to destroy man.

However, if your creature has some kind of biological basis, things don't evolve "just cause." Try to think through why your monster would exhibit these behaviors, how would they make them more fit and survive better in their environment? hinking through a creature's behavior and motives doesn't detract, but adds to its creepiness via realism.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's been my father and me since I was four.

I have hazy memories of my mother drinking, and her husband squinting at me in suspicion, and screaming, and the rainy night when my father came back for me. They called me by a name that was not my own and there wasn't an Amber Alert until twenty-four hours later. When people ask after her, I just shrug and say that it's been my father and me alone for as long as I could remember.

*Obviously his father is just a crazed serial killer who kidnapped him!* the intrepid and well-read audience deduces. No.

My father is my biological father, both of us cut from the same fine silk cloth, our raven hair falling in faces that drove people to madness. He just left me with my mother for a while, until I was old enough to learn from him.

My father taught me much from his Armani-clad knee, his classical face so full of love. He showed me how to hunt our quarry with a smile and then bleed them dry. How to want for nothing by tugging on an ego or laughing at a stupid joke. How to cajole and con in all kinds of vicious, underhand ways. Such is the nature of our kind, passed from father to son.

Father made sure I got into elite prep schools that smoothed the way for my top research university and studies into biology, but didn't really understand why I wanted these things. He thought it made much more sense to chase after wealthy, lonely people and get their fortunes out of them, like he has done since he was a sixteen year old living it up in the French Riviera.

"Laurent, light of my life, flesh of my soul," Father would sigh when I'd come down for breakfast after reading medical texts all night. "You'd be so much prettier if you got your nose out of those books and smiled."

But you all don't particularly care about my father.

I did undergraduate work in my university's biology lab, doing things such as cleaning equipment and prepping for the Bio 200 series labs. Not exciting, but it would make me a shoe-in for the hypercompetitive Genetics PhD program and forged industry and academic connections. The only downside was Harrison.

Harrison was one of the many graduate students. People liked Harrison, for reasons I cannot understand beyond his apparent attractiveness. He played lacrosse and was a blond and bragged about his 'gains' in weightlifting. He spent more time talking loudly than working. Intolerable.

Harrison wanted me bent over the lab table like so many before him. He'd come around my station and try to slip his hand under my lab coat, laughing when I'd bat it away. No amount of disinterest  and my disinterest was legendary  could make him go away. It seemed, in fact, that my rejection made him hungrier, drawing him closer and closer to frenzy. Obsession, the desperate desire to possess, was one of the downsides of being what I am.

At the end of my junior year, the head of the labs catered a meal for all the student workers. It was loud, becoming more drunken and annoying the longer it went on. I left early.

The night had been dark and clear, and when Harrison came from the shadows to grab my arm was the first time I felt real fear. It had always been I was the predator and the humans were the prey. It felt like a subversion of the natural order when Harrison hissed in my ear, "Take me to your apartment, pretty boy, I know how to make you less of a bitch."

He didn't lessen his grip as he practically pulled me up the steps of my apartment building, his disgusting hands crawling up my shirt as I unlocked my door. When it was shut, Harrison immediately slammed me up against it and threw the deadbolt, alcohol soaked mouth crashing down on my own. I wanted to cry.

"Not so haughty now," Harrison said. "Always knew you wanted it, you little slut."

He ripped at my shirt, and my fear suddenly turned to anger. I've been offered Ferraris and mansions and diamonds for what this man decided he was entitled to take. I've made far greater men than this beg and plead for the privilege of my time, and he decided that he deserved to just steal it from me?

"No," I said, and kicked him in the balls.

Harrison fell to the floor, groaning in pain. I was on him in an instant, knee pressing into his crotch and hands around his neck. Cold instinct, a primordial drive to claw and to bite and to *survive* at all costs that thrummed through my whole species, took over.

"I wanted you to leave me alone," I crooned at him, as sweet as a lover between my sheets. "You couldn't even manage that."

"I'm sorry!" Harrison yelled. I didn't really care about false platitudes  instead, I took out his jugular with my teeth. It was satisfying in a raw and visceral way, feeling this pathetic creature struggle and then still beneath me as I chewed my way through his neck down to the vertebrae. I pulled away, crouched over him and covered in blood, my breaths coming in pants as I realized that I was soaked with arterial spray and blood was leaking across my floors.

Suddenly, there was the dead body of a popular student in my living room and blood everywhere, his phone pinging with texts and notifications. People would notice if he went missing and even if I mounted a self-defense plea, the detectives would surely notice his gnawed-through neck. No amount of batting my eyelashes would spare me jail.

I sat on top of his corpse and tried to figure out how to dispose of a body and clean up the evidence within the six hours of darkness I had left, without having a lick of experience in the subject. My brain immediately gave that up and I instead ran to my eternal source of comfort and care.

"Papa," I whined into the phone. "Papa, I killed someone and there's blood everywhere."

"You're supposed to be good at planning, I told you to make an emergency kit," Father scolded me. "I should let you deal with this mess yourself, you're an adult now."

"*Papa,*" I cried. Father sighed.

"I can't deny you a thing, *mon chou,*" Father said. "Unlock your door and take off your ruined clothes, Papa will fix it."

Papa did.

Father came with industrial cleaner and plastic sheeting, helping me roll up the body and then wrap it in those black contractor bags. He also took my bloody clothing and put it in another bag, and left me to clean up my floor while he disposed of the body. After everything was cleaned up, Father sat with me in my little apartment, my head in his lap as he told me stories about his first kill and how he had called his father as well to help him clean it up. His brothers had teased him mercilessly for it.

"Just a little sloppy, darling," he cooed. "You'll get better at it."

It felt like the entire campus was out hunting for Harrison, whole crews of people combing through the woods where Harrison's factory reset cell phone and bloody jacket were found, but nothing else. The search tapered off, the disappearance becoming a campus legend. No one bothered to search the nearby lake in the opposite direction. My father had a cabin on the lake, inherited from my second stepmother, nestled cozily into the woods.

Sometimes I go there, when the lake is smooth and brilliant blue, my feet bare against the pebbled shore, and when I stare into the depths of it I smile.

I *have* gotten a lot better at it. My father taught me.

<TEXT> I am beautiful in ways men shouldn't be.

Pretty boy, lovely boy, with his flaxen curls framing a sweet face and big blue eyes with big black lashes. My mother, when she was in our run-down trailer and not at the bar, would say such looks were wasted on a boy and that she wished I was born a girl. I'm certain she wished I had never been born at all.

School was hellish from the start. Girls viewed me as a living doll to play dress-up with, and boys hated me because I made them confused. My third grade teacher once made a comment about my cherry red mouth, the gym coach complimented my porcelain skin. The computer teacher got fired after cornering me alone. I did not understand it  I wore run down charity store clothes, spent most of my time with my nose buried in a book, and barely brushed my hair. And yet, here was the whole school bearing down on me.

Puberty made it worse. All my classmates grew and stretched, flushed with hormones and lust. I grew some, yet no straggly hairs or bright red pimples popped on my china doll face. Instead, the star quarterback would torment me so he could grope at my long legs and graceful hips. My teachers would compliment my academic achievements and then mention that someone like me being so aloof was a shame. The theater teacher asked if I was "interested in boys" in hushed, hopeful whispers.

I was not gay or straight. I was Uninterested. Why would I waste time chasing after shallow and petty girls who were jealous of my appearance? Why would I let one of those testosterone-hopped jocks paw at my body and call me a faggot afterwards? Why would I want my fat, balding English teacher to bend me over for an easy A? They called me frigid, uptight, bitchy, rude, prudish. I wore it with pride all the way to the top of my class.

I left my little Midwest town for a college in the big city. I thought it would be easier there, full of beautiful people to blend into. Towards the end of November, my roommate tried to roofie my water bottle, and the double room became a single room very quickly. For sophomore year, I got a studio apartment on my own.

That fall quarter was beautiful, the trees like brilliant fire throughout campus, and I took a communications class required for my major. It was about giving presentations and speeches, and the school website said Professor O'Malley was to teach it  classmates had described him as a jolly old man, a little longwinded but excellent at teaching discourse and rhetoric.

I sat towards the front, my empty notebook neatly dated, and my classmates chattered all around me. I paid them no heed, eyes casted downwards, but I looked up when the door to the lecture hall opened right before class was to begin. The man who strode in was not Professor O'Malley.

He burnt white hot, reality dimming around his gravity. Everyone seemed so tarnished compared to him, dark-haired bronze-skinned Adonis among the gray and listless dead. Square-jawed and towering, his presence was so thick it was sweltering, smothering, suffocating. My classmates all gasped as his eyes swept across the class.

Adonis-among-the-dead stood at the front of the lecture hall and said, "Professor O'Malley had an unfortunate family emergency. I'm Professor Alexander Venus, and I'm taking over the class for the foreseeable future. Apologies to everyone who was hoping for good old John, he'll be back next quarter."

He spoke like rainwater, Adonis-among-the-dead, and no one seemed too broken up about Professor O'Malley being replaced by Professor Venus. His emerald gaze trawled through the suddenly eager students, before finally landing on me, sitting in the corner of the third row. It lingered there on my face, and Venus grinned with perfect teeth. For the first time in my life, my face grew hot.

Professor Venus looked away, then, and the TAs handed out the syllabus as he crooned out the class expectations like love poetry. Despite the crimson flush on my face, I wanted to ace this class like I aced all the others before, a deep-rooted desire to prove myself as more than just pretty flesh and skin. I would not be bested by an unexpected crush.

The first two weeks of class were shockingly normal, just Professor Venus talking about the basics of speaking. He wore designer, tailored clothing and Italian leather shoes, his car a flashy red BMW all the girls wanted inside of. There was no doubt he was a natural at this, his charisma a thing unto itself, and my dreams were plagued with green and bronze and hands and lips.

Two weeks of lecture, and we received our first assignment: an informative speech.

"Make it something you're passionate about," Professor Venus had purred. "Something that really makes your blood pump."

Based on those standards, most of the people in the class would've spoken about Professor Venus himself. A girl had found his Tinder profile and a boy his Grindr account, leading to frantic little pow-wows about what made Venus tick before class started. He didn't respond to either of their half-nude and borderline pornographic messages.

I wrote mine about the Amur leopard, *Panthera pardus orientalis.* There are only around sixty or seventy left in the wilds of southeastern Russian and northeastern China, due to poaching and deforestation. I gave what I thought was an impassioned speech about the dying species, and my peer reviews agreed with that thought. One girl cried over the leopards, but she was a bit sensitive.

Professor Venus just watched from the front, eyes never leaving me even as he took notes with a black fountain pen. While the peer reviews were given back immediately, the professor wouldn't give grades until all the speeches were concluded. I gave mine on the first day, and ended up being the last person in that lecture hall, besides Professor Venus himself.

I was placing my notebook in my bag when Venus stepped up behind me and said, "Dante."

I turned, blinking, and Venus was staring at me with calculation. I had professors and teachers and TAs hot to fuck me before, undressing me with their eyes as they imagined me bent over their desk, but Venus's gaze held none of that. It was simply...assessing.

"You could rule the world if you spoke with a bit more passion, Dante," he continued. He pronounced my name like a Florentine.

"What do you mean, Professor?" I asked. The thought of failure, of not being the best at something, gnawed at me like a hungry dog.

"Exuberance, joy, fascination, anger," Venus said with a laugh. "If you fluttered your eyelashes right, people would rip themselves apart for you."

I thought about his words all weekend, lingered on them as I stared at the shoes at the local department store. I needed nicer dress shoes for an internship interview, but even the discount rack made my bank account cry out. I pondered what luxuries I could give up  heating, warm water, coffee  when the man spoke beside me.

"Trouble picking out shoes?" he asked me. He wore a tailored blazer and had gray in his hair, wealth oozing from his pores. I thought about Professor Venus's words, and did not brush off the man out-of-hand like I would've before.

"No, it's just..." I said, looking at him between my lashes. The man touched the small of my back. "I have an interview for an internship and need new shoes, but..."

"College is so expensive these days," he said. I left that store with practically a new wardrobe, and all I had to do was let the man grunt above me as I laid sprawled on a California king mattress in his mansion. I left before dawn. When I came to class dressed in my new clothes, Professor Venus grinned at me.

I didn't think of it as a con or even prostitution, though people probably feel differently. Women seemed less inclined towards me, so instead I found men, wealthier the better, and let them give me things. In exchange, they'd beg for more of my attention. I didn't really care one way or another about the sex, but the *power* I held over these CEOs and lawyers and stockbrokers was indescribable. They would do anything for me, and I could get anything I wanted with a pout.

It was coming towards the end of the quarter and the long stretch of winter break when Professor Venus approached me again.

"I see that you took my advice to heart," Venus said. I knew he wasn't talking about speeches.

"Yes," I replied, and Venus smiled, fingers trailing across my shoulder.

"There's a bar I want to take you to," he said.

The fallout had we been caught doing this would've been immense; he was still my professor, I was underage. Yet there was no thought of consequences as Venus  *Alexander,* he crooned at me  escorted me into the high class bar on the expensive side of the city without a single person even mentioning my ID. Rules felt like things that happened to other people.

"You're a natural already," Alexander had whispered in my ear. "It's all the pity your father didn't teach you to hunt when you were younger."

"What do you mean?" I asked. I had not met my father. When I asked my mother about him, she spat on the ground.

"I'll show you," Alexander promised, and inclined his head towards a businessman watching us intently from a corner booth. Nice suit, nice watch, and lust in his eyes  exactly the kind I preferred, and it seemed Alexander did to.

Men are easily manipulated by their egos, and suddenly having two beautiful people make a beeline to you is quite the ego stroke indeed. It was easy to have him bring a car around to drive us to his lonely little penthouse, his wandering hands barely knowing who to touch.

It was Alexander who led us into the bedroom, peeled off the man's suit and pushed him on to the bed before stripping us both naked. He spooned up behind the man, arms around his chest and chin on his shoulder, and he said to me, "Watch, Dante."

Then his teeth sunk into the man's jugular.

I always thought that, if faced with a murder, I'd be disgusted and frightened like any human being would, even with my jacked-up sense of empathy. Yet as the blood splattered across me and dripped down Alexander's perfect teeth, I felt strangely...exhilarated. Alive. The blood was warm as it trickled down my pale skin, and my hands reached up to smear it across my white skin.

Alexander pulled out the man's throat with all the grace of a big cat, letting the body flop back down on to the bed. He looked triumphant, my Adonis-among-the-dead, and he pulled me into his arms as the man bled out on to his silk sheets.

"See, lovely?" he purred into my ear. "This is what you're meant to do."

We cleared out the apartment of valuables before we left, laughing and singing as the man's body cooled in the bedroom. That was the first of Alexander's many lessons.

Some of our kind specialize in a single gender, like I do, while others like Alexander can turn the head of anyone they want. None of us stick around longer than a handful of nights  extended exposure can lead to madness, and stalkers are a pain to dispose of. We get what we want and then leave with a kiss. How we propagate ourselves is simple.

Brood parasitism is a strategy where an animal, such as a cuckoo, tricks another into raising their offspring. It's easy to slip inside a stable little nest with a few kind words to an overworked and ignored wife, and leave all the hard work to her husband until the son starts coming into his abilities. Then we come back and take him to where he belongs.

I guess something went wrong with me, and that's why my father never came back for me. My mother must've hated me for being a constant reminder of her failed marriage. I wasn't taught to hunt in my adolescence, not allowed to bloom like Alexander did under his father's tutelage.

Alexander isn't going to let that happen to our son. He's five years old now, with dark curls and big green eyes, and I have his room painted and ready. He's currently with his mother and her husband out in some suburb, and whenever we drive by, we hear yelling. A teacher had recently been fired from his brand new elementary school. Clearly, she can't protect him.

We're coming for him tomorrow night. Our family is going to be complete. </TEXT>
