<TEXT> By this I mean you dislike it so much you just cannot continue. I do feel bad when I do this. I just read about 100 pages of a 450-page book about Simon Wesenthal and just want to forget about it and move on to something else. It feels like a waste of time but man this thing was painfully boring. </TEXT>

I can't put them outside yet because it is a bit too chilly. Any ideas? Should I move to a mix with some sand and peet and hope they drain faster? Bigger pot? How often should I be watering? Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone, so I bought some seeds online and they arrived this week. I ended up finding some locally and don't really need the ones that arrived. Am I able to sell them on my local classifieds site without any paperwork or anything? I just want to play it safe and not face any legal ramifications. I have already arranged a transaction but it seems fishy- small amount of seeds wanted, will be arriving with a friend, insists on meeting INSIDE the cafe as opposed to just outside the door- maybe he is just taking safety measures and I am just being paranoid. Anyway, thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone, about to make my 1st swap. I bought tiny plastic baggies at a discount ship, but also made seed envelopes to put into a bigger envelope. Which is the best way to go? I read that the seeds could mold in the plastic, but these seeds are so tiny I'd hate for them to fall out of the envelope and get lost.. Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone, just starting to get into gardening and think the idea of seed swapping is brilliant. The only problem is, I don't have anything to swap yet.

My question is: Are there any plants native to Canada that are desirable to non-Canadians that I can look into acquiring to eventually trade?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

I am in zone 5b (Canada) and understand we need to be mindful of cold-hardiness when choosing tree types, but how important is this when they will only be outdoors for spring   summer months?

Apologies if my question is completely off the rails, thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With a completed EJS, the record is accessible up to 2 years but the charge is still dismissed (or stayed depending on local practice). There are certain ppl who can access a youth record ONLY when the record is still accessible, meaning an EJS can be accessible for up to 2 years so they can retrieve that record within those 2 years.

At this point, the only way anything would show up on your record is if you were charged as an adult within the access period of your youth record. In that case, your youth record carries over and is part of your adult record. But this did not happen. An EJS is one of the least intrusive sentencing options in the YCJA, reserved for minor offences and not meant to hinder an offender's future prospects.

Nothing at all should be on your record, but if you want to put your mind completely at ease, what you could do is order a criminal record check from your local police force. Then you know for sure. It will not be a complete waste, criminal record checks are good to have for volunteer work or if you go on a school class trip with your child/niece/nephew etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, youth probation officer here. Sounds like you were given an extra judicial sanction, meaning you are given a set of conditions to follow where, if met, the case is dismissed. Usually fingerprints
 aren't taken for these though but not completely impossible.
 Records for EJS are kept for 6 months up to 2 years. Even if found guilty theft is a summary offence and your record would only be accessible for 3 years after sentence completion. You're good to go.


Edit: Incomplete info- to make sure records are sealed, check with the arresting police force to ensure this has occurred. Even if they don't have direct access to that info they are a 1st point of contact and can at least confirm/deny whether your fingerprint files were destroyed.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, former user who had no luck streaming without pixelating and freezing. Signed up for a 1-day trial today and had a better experience, but wondering if there is anything I can do. So far, I set to random server (had it on Toronto but the program chose Montreal and it seemed to improve), turned off HQ streams, enabled InputStream Client for RTMP streams in Kodi. My speed is anywhere from 5-8 mbps download which ppl say is definitely good enough, I am just not having the success I feel I should be having. Any advice Re: anything else I can do, I'd appreciate it. </TEXT>

Edit: Can someone tell me what "server type" is, RTMP vs HLS. I noticed I may have accidentally changed it to HLS, changed it to RTMP, it buffered a bit at first then it seemed to be OK.  
Edit2: now HLS seems way better. Obviously I have some exploring to do / decisions to make.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Paid sports packages with slower rural Internet? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-26 16:10:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think I know the answer to this but I'll ask anyway. 

I live in the country and have wifi-only internet that hovers around 8-9 mbps download, which is pretty good for a rural area, but probably considered to be a minimum speed for Kodi. I tried a Smoothstreams trial about 2 months ago and it was great but just too laggy. Does anyone out there live in a rural area and have good luck with a paid sports subscription? If not, I guess I will continue trying to get streams through ProSport and SportsDevil. 

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone, 1st time poster in this sub. Hope everyone takes care of themselves today. Anyway, depression sufferer for about 6 years now. Went through about 5 different antidepressants before getting off them about 3 months ago in favour of a cannabis subscription.

Results have been mixed. I do not do the cannabis everyday, and maybe if I did things would be better. But I'm feeling sad, angry, and just plain flat. I am thinking about going back on meds but the side effects on the most recent one I took included sweating through like 2-3 shirts per day and lack of sleep.

Any advice from people on a cannabis subscription OR who have struggled with their med regimen but finally found something that worked would be appreciated.  </TEXT>

I looked over and she was purple, trying to cough but nothing coming out. Dropped the broom, got behind her and did a pretty aggressive Heimlich maneuver- she was super tiny and I was lifting her right off her feet. Luckily, the piece of hot dog made its way up and she spit it out. 

Of course it was my duty afterwards to remind her of the time she choked on the big wienie:) </TEXT>
