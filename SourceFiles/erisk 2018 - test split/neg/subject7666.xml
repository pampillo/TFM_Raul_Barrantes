<TEXT> Had a coworker once who was legitimately terrified about an upcoming period when she would be making more than her husband (he was between jobs, finishing his airline pilot training) and was baffled that no one else in the office cared if the woman in a relationship made more than the man. Her dad had drilled that into her head from a young age, along with a lot of other sexist crap. Everyone she asked was confused and kept saying versions of "That just means more money, so, good?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> No real attempt at trimming, not a lot of luck at taming. Mostly I was going for growth to see what I'd get, and I think I'm at the point where I need a professional to work on it a bit. 

My hair is very fine and resists shaping. I wash it twice a week, use conditioner regularly and beard oil daily, and it still decides for itself what it wants to do on any given day. The mustache is still in the annoying phase where it's not long enough to go sideways past my mouth and eating anything wet is a challenge.

But I'm still enjoying the look and feel, and the reactions I get.

<TEXT> I was a Piers Anthony fan back in the 80s when he was really hitting it big. His Xanth books were fun and funny and I started hunting out his other works. Even met him at a con and got the first Incarnations of Immortality book signed.

Only his other works started veering towards kids and sexuality until it was rare that he'd write a book that didn't include it somewhere. And the Xanth books got more and more creepy (a YA fantasy book called "The Color of Her Panties"? Really?) and now I can't read any of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a little torn on these.

I don't think any of them match Parker in his prime. But some of them seem to me to be comparable to Parker's later books when the text was getting bigger and the page margins wider.

Ace Atkins' Spenser books seem to be getting better. The dialogue mostly works, he gets the elements required for every Spenser book, and the plots aren't bad. I do feel a little weird when he reveals anything about Spenser's or Hawk's past, like it's not really his to talk about, but he hasn't done anything out of character.

Reed Farrel Coleman's Jesse Stone books don't work as well for me. If I had read them first, they'd probably be just fine as mystery novels, but he doesn't hit the tone and characterization I'm expecting and he seems set on making big changes to that world.

I haven't caught up on the Cole   Hitch books yet so I can't discuss Robert Knott's books, but I'd love to hear what people think about them.

(If you haven't read any of these, what do you think about new authors taking over for deceased ones?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is one of you shy, or uncertain about how to proceed? If it's her, go with missionary. If it's him, go with her on top. 

But if neither of you are particularly shy and you're both comfortable with each other,  consider the male sitting up and the female sitting on him. She controls the penetration, gravity can help her, and in that position she won't be taking all of him which might be a way to ease into things. Also that way you're still face to face and you both have both hands free. (And LOTS of foreplay and/or lube is your very best friend.)

If it's the first time for either or both of you, remember: you'll get better, it takes time to learn what to do, what the other person needs/wants, and how to make it better. And nothing has to stop just because the guy finished. Fingers and tongues keep right on working. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on the book. 

Most books I read in gulps, sentence by sentence or even paragraph by paragraph if its particularly dull exposition. If a book is especially good or the writer has a way with language, I'll slow down and savor it. Also if it's complex and I need to move slowly to understand it, and even then it's pretty fast.

Nonfiction books I read more slowly, for comprehension and retention.

I read a lot. But I don't see it as anything to brag about or even recommend, necessarily, since for all I know a slower reader gets more out of the books they read, or they may remember details for a longer time. It works for me, and it's how I've read for almost 50 years so it's unlikely I'll be changing anytime soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After 30+ years of loyal fanboy comics-reading, I finally stopped following characters wherever they went about a decade ago. I got tired of the regular reboots and retcons. I got tired of having to buy several more comics a week to keep up with my favorites. I got tired of the insult to my intelligence and sloppy story-telling of huge events that always ended with big changes and at least one shocking death that would last maybe a year. 

My last holdout was Spider-Man and that stopped dead for me with "One New Day." Clearly there was no point in getting invested in any history or relationships when they could all go away if an editor didn't like them. DC was just as bad later when the New52 decided no one could be happy or married, ever. Bye, all those books, too. 

Since then I've been following writers and artists I like instead, and comics that are self-contained. 

But I have to assume the Big Two aren't stupid. Big events MUST make enough money and bring in new readers to keep wanting to do them, right?

What do you think would happen if Marvel and DC allowed the monthly books to develop their own story arcs without getting yanked into big crossover events for five years or so? </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Superman: Red Son" was a three-part "hey, what if" story that didn't touch the regular Superman series or character at all. 

The HydraCap thing has been going on for a year now in regular continuity. That's Steve Rogers, doing and saying these things, for whatever reason. 

We know the "real" one will be back, likely in time for the next big movie. We're not stupid or new at this. And when it's said and done, it might be a worthwhile story. 

But in the meantime, it's not making us like Steve very much and Marvel and isn't handling the backlash very well. 

How will he deal with his actions when he's back? Or, worse, will the whole thing get hand-waved away? 

Then there's the dismissiveness toward real-world atrocity. We only won WWII because of a Cosmic Cube? This isn't the Kree-Skrull war or the superhero registration Civil War, this is talking about a very real, very horrible event that Marvel is using as a plot device at a time when the real Holocaust is being denied and minimized. 

If Clinton (or even Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio) were president, it wouldn't be as bad. If it had been a 3-issue "What If?" story it would probably win awards. But a story dragging on this long that makes fans hate their favorite character? Just no, not for me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife fell and broke her wrist very badly a few years ago. The doctor came to the hospital in the middle of the night to operate and put in a brace, we were very appreciative of his work. Paid the deductible, all good.

Turns out the doc was a jerk who didn't want to be bothered after he sweeps in and saves the day, and wouldn't recommend her for therapy, told her that doing housework would get it back in shape. (We heard horror stories about him after that, he was great initially but HATED followup care and ducked it when he could.) After a month she realized she could barely move it so she found therapy anyway, which insurance wouldn't cover because the doc hadn't prescribed it. 

Fast-forward another few months and she realizes it's not straightened the way it was supposed to and she can't bend her hand back without pain. Went to another doc -- had a hell of a time finding one that would go against a fellow doctor -- and discovered the brace in her wrist was too high and was blocking movement so she had to get more surgery. Insurance didn't want to cover that at all since it was "elective."

There followed weeks of arguing, with us (and the second doctor) fighting to get it approved. Finally did, but damn. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Friends and family. If you know someone who's a performer of any type, ask if you can shoot them while they're on (if appropriate). That helps give you some good shots to show other people.

You could also try sites like Model Mayhem where models will often meet you for TF shots (trade for prints, trade for digital images, etc). You don't pay them, they don't pay you, you both get practice and images for your portfolios. Keep in mind that you still may not get offers or acceptances if the portfolio you post isn't good yet, and there are a lot of flakes on both sides of the camera in there. And not every model or photographer listed there will do TF shots. But I've also made some friends and gotten some great shots that way that led to paying work, sometimes with the same model I shot for free earlier. </TEXT>

I liked some of the fight scenes, but Danny should have been one of the greatest martial artists in the world even without the Fist and I didn't get that.

(One thing I did like was his style. When they could show it, his moves were effortless and smooth, anticipatory. But that was more apparant in the early episodes, and nearly abandoned later on.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's hard to tell if the total story arc is actually good or bad before it's finished. It's pretty easy to judge individual books, or how you feel about the last six months. I don't know about you, but I don't read a book and go huh, I wonder if I'll think this is good a year from now. I might feel differently about it in context when the full thing is done, but right now I'm reacting to individual stories as they come out because that's how monthly comics work. 

If they're upset about people judging them on unfinished stories, perhaps they should have waited and released the whole thing in one or two big books. 

But my complaint isn't about the books, really. I'm not a fan of this storyline and I think no matter how good the finished product is, they've done a lot of damage to the character's brand and their own. But I also recognize there are a lot of readers who like it. Fair enough. 

My complaint is Marvel and its people telling me how I should react to a piece of art.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [This is actress Morena Baccarin](http://imgur.com/a/uALf0), taken at a convention in Orlando a few years back. Light was low in the room so my shutter speed was slow and with some careful timing and waiting for moments I got some good clear shots.
 Then, there was this.

I caught her whipping her head back and forth laughing. When I saw it in the camera display later I figured it was ruined but didn't delete it. When I got home and looked, I liked it better than the "good" ones.

What pics have you taken that you totally screwed up and got cool results? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe you are honest and sincere. You also need to talk to a lot more people and not just online.

 There is no sole definition of Homosexual Pride day, that I know of. 

I can tell you the sole reason for the Gay Pride March. The first one was in 1970, a year after the Stonewall Riot when LGBTQ persons rioted after a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. It was held despite strenuous objection from NYC. After that, the decision was made to hold it every year "in order to be more relevant, reach a greater number of people, and encompass the ideas and ideals of the larger struggle in which we are engaged-that of our fundamental human rights."

 There is a large amount of Homosexuals on the internet, and they're never shamed...

Wow. I honestly don't know how to respond to that, in the same way I wouldn't know how to politely respond to someone who assured me, sincerely, that the earth was flat.

All I would say is to go find any YouTube video posted by a gay person and read the comments. Or find a Twitter feed of a gay person and read the stuff sent to them. Or ask any gay person with a strong online presence to send you copies of their email. Or google "homophobic harassment online" and read for awhile.

Is it better than it was? In many ways, yes. Gays can marry. Public harassment of them is considered bad now, for most people. Many famous people are publicly gay and still have a career.

But the anonymity of the Internet allows harassment and abuse and there is an awful lot of it. You're basing your very sincere, I-just-want-to-know questions on an assumption that simply isn't true. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some charter schools perform as well or better. Some perform markedly worse. Some destabilize existing nearby public schools. [Some turn out students who perform better on standardized tests but have much lower success rates in the job market](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/08/23/charter-schools-boost-test-scores-nothing-else/D6F7vTwLTqYnBJyeupoODK/story.html). Some are outright scams. 

I'm not against charter schools per se. I think that run properly with priority for the students over the bottom line, they can be incredibly useful. I am against draining public schools to fund them. I am against charter schools operating without the accountability and transparency that public schools have.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "It" being...?

Homosexuality? No. Everything about humans is and always has been a curve, and there will always be people all along that line. There is very little about a human being that is either/or and a lot of grief has come about through the years from people insisting that there is.

The need for a pride parade? I think that when it really doesn't matter to the vast majority of people who you have sex with, then the need for a gay pride parade will fade away. By that point I could see it evolving into a general woo-hoo-sex day like some other cultures have, just from tradition. </TEXT>

Along with a page of pulmonic consonants, syllable structures, a vowel chart, simple grammar, and a couple-hundred-word lexicon.

<TEXT> DeVos wants to pull funding away from public education and funnel it toward charter schools. There is no evidence that charter schools are any more successful than public schools overall, and in many cases they have been harmful. DeVos and her family have fought hard to reduce oversight and accountability for charter schools in Michigan. The New York Times reported that she had told a meeting of Christian philanthropists in 2001 that education reform was a way to "advance God's kingdom." 

She is not an educator. Prior to her posting she had never set foot in a public school. She knows nothing about running a school, running a school board, running a school district. She's a lobbyist with an agenda and she's been given the keys.

<TEXT> You can be inclined to disagree all you like. Doesn't make it so. I'm pretty sure the 49 gay people killed in the Pulse nightclub shooting last year might disagree. 

[Attacks and hate crimes against LGBT people have been increasing](http://fusion.net/it-s-still-dangerous-to-be-gay-in-america-here-are-the-1793857468). 

There are lots of people still upset that gays can marry here. Our current vice-president is in favor of abusive anti-gay therapy. Our current Justice Department has removed protections from transgender people already. Gender identity has been removed from the U.S. Census. Much of the current administration has advocated against and/or voted against gay rights advances.

Evangelical Christianity has risen dramatically in Brazil, where hate crimes against gays have been skyrocketing in recent years. Indonesian officials are trying to ban homosexuals from holding office and there are bills in the works to criminalize it. In Nigeria recent laws have all but encourage violence against gay people. And that's not counting the Middle Eastern countries, or the anti-gay movement in Russia, or the concentration camps in Chechnya...

I would suggest you ask some gay people how safe they feel, how easy it is to get a job or rent an apartment. It is MUCH better than it was, but things are not equal. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Amazing Johnathan is touring again: still amazing </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-30 19:24:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Amazing Johnathan was told that due to his cardiomyopathy, he had 18 months to live. His heart was unable to get blood through his system. His hands and legs would lock up periodically, which as he said is not the best thing for a magician. He performed his last show at the Magic Castle and retired. 

That was three years ago. 

Now apparently he's gotten tired of waiting to die and he's out on the road again, and I saw him Friday night at the Orlando Improv.

Which excited the hell out of me. I loved his specials and appearances but never thought I'd get to see him. I saw his poster by accident when I was at Pointe Orlando and walked past the Improv. I was messaging a friend at the time and sent him a picture; found out he was an even bigger fan and he had bought tickets for himself before I had reached my car.

The Amazing Johnathan is a bit smaller now than his larger-than-life persona used to be. Skin hangs a little looser. He doesn't move as wildly or abruptly. He doesn't stalk his volunteers around the stage the way he did (granted, this was a tiny stage). Most of the way through his act he stepped offstage to sit and rest for a bit while his wife took over and stuck a skewer through her arm, to music. The man has clearly been through some shit and is still slogging through it now. Most (not all) of his act were jokes I'd already seen over and over on his specials.

And damn me if I didn't laugh just as hard seeing them again.

His timing is *perfect*. That damn eyebrow glare gets me every time. The jokes are set up beautifully, he is in total control of the flow of the volunteer segment, and when the obnoxious drunks who had interfered with the previous two comedians started acting up he ignored them magnificently and rolled right over them. He had the room in his pocket from the beginning.

He did start off with an acknowledgement of his condition. "So if I fall to the stage it's not a joke. *Help me*." And then he laughed.

He looked very tired after, while fans were buying shirts and DVDs and his wife took pics of him with everyone. 

But onstage, he was Amazing.

This is just the beginning of his tour so if you get the chance, run do not walk and go see him. And remember those wise words: "Sometimes magic sounds a lot like tape." </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Quantum Night" by Robert J. Sawyer. 

It's a lightweight book. Many of Sawyer's works tend to follow a similar pattern: he comes up with an intriguing idea about consciousness or something, and then contrives a plot to give his characters the chance to thoroughly explore it. Characters are almost always Canadian scientists or professors, and a large number of them are massive Star Trek fans in a way that's integral to the plot.

(Not putting him down here, I like his work and some of it is completely unlike this, but enough of them are to indicate a trend.)

In "Quantum Night" he looks at sociopaths, unconscious sentient people, and conscious conscientious people, and the scientists who discover how to switch people from state to state. I was reading this back at the beginning of the last presidential campaign, and that was really the wrong time to read about rising levels of fascism, fear-based ruling, and people lacking empathy but possessing a great deal of cunning. "Quantum Night" stayed with me for weeks after I finished. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By the same logic, Breast Cancer Awareness Month should be changed to Disease Awareness Month. All disease is bad and we should be working to eliminate all of them, yes? 

Feminism doesn't represent the equality of all genders. Feminism addresses a specific range of problems that affect women and their place in the workplace, law and society. People who consider themselves feminists have chosen that range of issues to work on. Doesn't mean other issues aren't as important, doesn't even mean that other gender bias issues aren't as important. But you have to pick your battles and the more specific you can be, the more effective you are. 

Besides, forcing feminists to subsume their issues into a larger, generalized heading is to minimize them, make them invisible again, which is kind of a big part of what they're fighting against. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very good article. Something that wasn't touched on, though, is that stories that strike at the core of who a beloved character is are always going to be controversial, even without Nazis.

When Spider-Man was revealed to have been his clone all along, fans went nuts and deservedly so. Even though Ben Reilly was (then) just as good a guy as Peter, even though according to the comics everything we'd experienced happening to Peter "really" happened to Ben, fans revolted at the idea and it was quickly revealed that no, whoops, didn't carry the two, it was really Peter.

Same with Gwen Stacy's kids with Norman Osbourne. Aside from being a terrible story, it changed Gwen Stacy into someone who would have an affair with a much older (and sociopathic) man while still with Peter. Fans... were not pleased.

Then there's neck-snapping Superman in the movies...

It's not just adding layers and depths to characters, it's when comics creators decide to screw with the characters' natures in ways that they can't come back from. In this case, Secret Empire might be an amazing story, but it may not be worth the hit that Captain America will take, both in comics as he comes to grips with the memories of all this and in pop culture as fans try to come to terms with their beloved character's intriguing new fascism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, the lack of condemnation argument doesn't work for me. Absence of condemnation on events that have been blown out of proportion does not mean those actions are condoned or accepted. (Speaking of the first two, haven't heard about the third so can't comment.) 

I'd say that while the obnoxious actions of the woman in the "Big Red incident" may give you a strident feminist to point out, the constant attacks and doxxing on her prove that for every one woman who gets noticed there are thousands of idiot men willing to prove why feminism is needed. And I can't feel sorry for the panelists at the "UMASS incident" since Milo would be hugely disappointed if he DIDN'T get powerful reactions. That's kind of his thing.

<TEXT> The other comments are handling the technical options nicely, so I'll just add: don't jiggle the camera. Get a sharp focus, and then either use a remote shutter or set the timer and step away. A tripod alone doesn't guarantee perfectly steady shots.

You should also try to get your pictures when the moon is still close to the horizon. The higher up it gets, the more direct sunlight it gets (no matter what phase it's in) and it's tougher to get good details.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thing is, the exact same figures could be explained by people not wanted to publicly identify as feminists because there has been such a concentrated effort by some people to paint feminists as man-hating bitches. 

"I believe that despite what feminists say "feminism" is, an increasing majority of people do not consider feminism to be promoting of either equality nor inclusiveness." If feminists aren't being taken at their word as to what they want, whose fault is it? Theirs? Or the people who insist on declaring them to be evil? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know how many marchers really think that President Trump and the politicians seeking to slash funding for research, gut the EPA or back away from climate change legislation are going to suddenly change their minds because of a bunch of people made funny signs.

But what the march does accomplish is demonstrate how many voters feel very strongly about this. It undermines Trump   Co's position that all Americans agree with them. It lets corporations know that lobbying to get changes made that are anti-science and profitable will be noticed and pointed out. 

These marches demonstrate, over and over, that delegitimizing science will not be ignored and will not be normalized. 

But one of the biggest benefits of the march is for the people marching. People who have been discouraged, outraged or terrified at the constant, every-single-day bad news coming out of the White House can be at least reassured that there are many, many other people who agree with them. It's cathartic. It's therapeutic. It brings hope that this energy can be carried forward to the next elections where it can make some real change. And in that, it was an unqualified success.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bookstores? I've been buying Pratchett since I found a used copy of "Strata" and since I was a Niven fan at the time and this was a parody of "Ringworld," I went for it. A few years later I heard about Discworld -- he was three books in by then -- and I started buying them as they came out. Little tricky in the states since this was way-pre-Amazon, I had to order import copies from a science fiction bookstore in California. Worth it. There are a couple missing from the shelves, on loan to my housemate.

Gaiman I've loved since "Sandman" and have been buying his stuff on sight since. Some of his rarer stuff I have as ebooks, thanks to his recent HumbleBundle sale. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At a con in Florida years back, I got to talk to him for awhile at his booth when there was a break in the action and he was pleasant, funny, friendly, and maybe a little tipsy but not something I really noticed (this was before his problems were public). I was surprised at how muscular he was, since Xander wasn't known for his bulk and the show hadn't been over for that long. Came away thinking he was a really nice, fun guy.

But at a Whedonverse panel later in the day, he was clearly drunk and disruptive.  Nathan Fillion led the panel and did an excellent job of keeping him focused, but it was awkward to watch.

Some books I tend to re-read every year or every couple of years, the way you'd rewatch a favorite movie. Sometimes a new book will come out in a series and I'll get motivated to go back and reread the rest (a bit of a problem with Discworld and Spencer books, after awhile). Sometimes something will trigger a memory of a passage I really like and I'll find myself picking the book up again just to get that feeling again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Older science fiction fans know him. When science fiction went wild and weird and surrealistic in the late 60s and 70s, he was in the middle of it, and it's hard to say a Hugo winner and World Fantasy Award winner who was nominated for many more awards was never read.

I think there are several answers as to why he's all but forgotten now. I think because his work was so uncategorizable, he was harder to market and harder to place. I think that readers tend to pick a favorite in any given area, and Phillip K. Dick seems to have grabbed the trippy writer gig while Robert Sheckley owned science fiction humor then and Douglas Adams took it over in the 80s. I think that his work didn't lend itself well to movies or TV so his name never got much farther than the sf bookshelves. All guesses, of course.

Lafferty has been described as a writers' writer. He didn't hit the big leagues himself, but he inspired many who did.  </TEXT>

I think I like "Rachel Rising" a bit more than "Echo," which was great but was also a fairly straight-forward story. Can't say if I like "Motor Girl" more than either, it's early days yet. But I'm loving it so far.

(None of these match "Strangers in Paradise," which has to be judged separately, like a great novel compared to great short stories.) </TEXT>

 Can I be obsessed with taking the perfect picture of The Batman, the one that defines him forever?

<TEXT> Since he is talented with Photoshop, I'm going to take some unsubstantiated guesses why someone would impose that limitation on themselves.

* He might like seeing the image immediately, right there and then.
* He might like the challenge of doing it in camera, the extra manic desperation of trying to *get it right* that can sometimes trigger aha moments like poses that he might not have thought of otherwise.
* He might get results that wouldn't occur to him to add in Photoshop. Maybe a secondary reflection of the light off an arm back onto the body, or a glow through the skin or something, that would only be discovered by actually doing the thing rather than trying to create it later.

Or he's pretentious. No idea. But he shoots amazing stuff and if that's how it works for him, more power to him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Been googling and apparently, our happy little flowers are wedelias, and are considered an invasive species where we live in central Florida. Haven't noticed them moving beyond the front of the yard where they've been for a couple years now -- not invading the neighbors or anything -- so we'll probably leave them be. We haven't been tending beyond removing fallen branches or occasionally pulling some vines out to keep them from strangling the other plants and even that's something we do maybe two or three times a year.

<TEXT> We have a patch of yellow wildflowers that have grown wild in our front yard. Everything has, really; when we moved in the area had just been carved out of the woods and we liked the wild look, so we've left our yard untended and wildlife-friendly. 

But we had a hard freeze this winter and the flowers died off. Now they're starting to come back but the plants are still covered in dead leaves. For the health of the flowers, are we better off cutting off the dead leaves, leaving them alone, or cutting them all back to the ground to grow fresh? </TEXT>

<TEXT> One morning a decade or so back I had been cut off in traffic and had to swerve to avoid a wreck, and I was furious. Just, screaming in the car, ready to punch somebody furious. I drove into the city and passed a church and the ubiquitous sign outside said something like, "You can use anger, but rage always uses you."

Cliched, hokey, and *exactly* what I needed to see at that moment. My rage just drained out of me. I pulled over and just laughed at myself for a few minutes, and ever since I may get annoyed or aggravated at other drivers, I don't let them get to me. I even started driving more defensively and made sure I always had space around me on the highway, even if I had to slow down to get it. Best church advice this atheist ever got. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just explaining something doesn't qualify as "mansplaining." To truly mansplain, it has to hit the following qualifications:

* It must be unrequested.
* It must be delivered to a person who already knows it, and may possibly know more about it than the mansplainer.
* It should include some element of condescension, since there's clearly no way a woman would know this.
* It must come from a man who either does not notice, accept or really care that the listener already knows it.

The last one really nails it. Absolutely there is mansplaining and women bear the largest brunt of it, although truly egregious mansplainers will do it to anyone, male and female alike.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Terry Pratchett story: Saw him at Necronomicon in Tampa many years back, brought a suitcase of books to be signed (I went through the line three times so as not to hog him). A friend with me didn't own any of his books but really wanted to get something signed, so I suggested we stop by a market and grab something random. "Hand him a box of cereal," I said, "and say 'I really admire your work.' See what he says."

I got my first load of books signed while I stammered something at him, and then she thrust a box of Captain Crunch forward, with her compliments. He looked at her for maybe 10 seconds, then grinned and signed it "Yum, yum. Terry Pratchett."

She spent years after that, taking the box to conventions and getting it signed by various science fiction writers and actors. It's still sitting proudly on her shelf. </TEXT>

Odds are good that people in this sub are, generally, heavier readers than most, with a better likelihood of a wider range of interests.

An unreasonable number of Robert J. Sawyer's main characters in this time period are scientists or professors who like the same pop culture and all obsess on Star Trek to the point where an episode or quote from the show becomes an essential element in Sawyer's book. I like his work, but seriously, dude, meet some new people.

<TEXT> Anything you use a lot, really. 

--------------------------------
The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots thatd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes Boots theory of socioeconomic unfairness.

<TEXT> I'm not going to lie, I'm 51 and I love YA books as much as I do any other type, provided that they are well-written and they entertain or inspire or amuse or engage me. Books written for the YA adult market aren't, I think, any more likely to be badly written. 

YA books, if they have anything in common, are not quite as complex as "grown-up" literature since the writers assume their target audience has not yet had the experiences that grown-ups have had. But they can be just as affecting and meaningful.

My two favorites weren't YA when they were written, as that genre wasn't a thing yet. They were (and are) science fiction. "Ender's Game," by Orson Scott Card, and "Jumper" by Stephen Gould. Both later made into subpar movies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some Instagram tips:

Follow photographers who inspire you, and like and comment on images that catch your attention with a little more praise than just "Nice!" Social networks work better when you're social, and every photographer loves it when people notice elements of their work. Heck, if they did something you envy, tell them so and ask how they did it. I've gotten some great tips that way.

If you see photographers posting similar images to the ones you take, pay attention to who follows, likes and comments on their work. Go check out THEIR feeds, and like or comment on some of their posts (if you feel like it, don't fake it). Some of them may tap your name to see who you are and see something they like. If your pictures are similar to Photographer A, then fans of Photographer A may like yours too and that's an easy way to let them know you exist.

Post regularly. 

Use hashtags. There are hashtag generators such as https://displaypurposes.com/ or the Focalmark app, and you can save sets of hashtags you use often in a textfile on your phone to copy and reuse. Put your hashtags in a comment, rather than the main post. Less annoying to people to scroll past. Since you're a landscape photographer, make sure you post location hashtags.

Use hashtags or @s for photography hubs to possibly get your work featured, such as @world_shotz, @capturelandscapes, @wonderful_places, etc. They may regram your image and tag you -- and they will almost certainly get more likes for your pic than you ever will -- and it gets your name and work out to a larger audience. Here's a list: https://brianventh.com/2016/04/instagram-feature-accounts

Keep your feed focused. This was tough for me, I went back through and deleted a lot of images that weren't about my photography, but you want this to be your portfolio and not what you had for lunch. (Unless you're a food photographer.)

Remember that you're not after numbers of followers, likes or comments. You want dedicated fans, ideally ones that will buy from you or least tell other people about you. One fan who buys a print is better than 10,000 likes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Publishers and media companies also greatly underestimated how much they had pissed off consumers right as this technology was available. I remember the articles about CDs and how even though they cost much less than an LP to create, ship and store, they still cost more but don't worry, they price will come down. This was, of course, a lie. Plus more and more stories were piling up about  companies making record profits while stiffing artists, etc., so by the time IRC and Napster and Grokster and LimeWire and all the rest popped up, few music lovers had any loyalty to the companies. And the companies, rather than deciding they should find a way to get out in front of this move, fought hard against it and pissed off even more people.

I don't advocate piracy. But man, if there were worse ways to respond to it I can't think of any. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. It finally broke me of my lifelong habit of collecting comics by character. I had been a Spider-Man fan since the early 70s and faithfully bought his books wherever he appeared, and while I was already getting very tired of the increasing numbers of BIG EVENT CROSSOVERS THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING AND SOMEONE SURPRISING DIES this was the story that finally told me there was no point in getting invested in a long-term character in a hero book.  Why care about the latest love interest? The next editor might decide to retcon them away because he doesn't like them.

I dropped a lot of books after that, books I had been buying largely out of habit and completeness. I don't power through a lousy story arc anymore, waiting for a good creative team to come to the book. Now I just find good writers and artists and follow them instead. Turns out I'd rather read a good story about a character I've never heard of than a crappy story about a character I like.

"One More Day" wasn't the only reason, but it was the most blatant one and a big tipping point for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Say, Marvel, remember two of your best-selling, critically acclaimed books of recent years, "Hawkeye" and "Vision"? Know what I liked about 'em? It wasn't just the writing and the great dialogue and the amazing art and the way they weren't afraid to take new looks at very old characters to make something fresh and new.

It was also because both books were allowed to have complete, years-long story arcs to tell their stories. 

STOP WITH THE CROSSOVERS. They were annoying enough when they were every summer, now they're all year long and not even fully plotted out. Crossovers get you short-term bumps, but they aggravate the long-time readers that are your solid base.

Crossovers and events and hero deaths with zero meaning because you know they'll be back before the next movie and retro-reboot-redos on editorial whim that ensure there's no reason to ever get emotionally invested in a storyline because by next year it might never have happened are why I largely stopped reading hero books at all. Now I follow writers and artists I like, I've given up on character loyalty. Or company loyalty, for that matter.

I really liked "Hawkeye" and "Vision," though. Maybe try some more like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, it was "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel."

I liked Buffy the first season or so, then started getting annoyed by her from then on, but we watched because the supporting cast was fantastic. (My wife and I had nothing against the actress, and we loved it when she got to play different versions of herself, but Buffy in her right mind was getting insufferable.) 

Angel we never particularly liked so we avoided his spinoff show till friends convinced us to give it a try. It helped that the other characters were making fun of the same things about him that we didn't like, so we stuck with it.

Also Ted in "How I Met Your Mother," but someone already mentioned that. </TEXT>

In the very first episode the other characters make fun of Angel for being broody and anguished, and they keep doing it. We liked Angel better in his own show (still not a favorite). But we loved the supporting cast and as others have already commented, this show has some of the best character arcs, the best seasons, and one of the best show finales ever. Well worth watching.

Season 4 still sucked, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Scalzi, to me, is the science fiction version of Robert B. Parker, author of the Spenser mystery novels (among many others). 

You buy 'em for the ideas and the dialogue. You're not going to get a lot of description and you may not get a terribly complicated plot. You will get witty characters who get things thrown at them and you watch them deal with it. That's pretty much it.

If you enjoy this style, you'll love his work. If you don't, you won't.  </TEXT>

If it's a human, I have fun avoiding any version of the word "yes," sometimes with very convoluted responses. ("It seems to me, at this time, to be quite possibly so.") I don't give out info. And I end each of these calls with, "Please remove all of my information from any and all databases available to your company. In the U.S., anyway, they have to.

The one that really bugs me? "Hi, is this Carol"? "I'm afraid you have the wrong number." "Oh, I'm sorry, but maybe you can help me. Have you heard about this great new service..." </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're serious about the coffee shop, consider finding an existing one that might enjoy having shelves of books in it and working something out with them.  

Other than that... if your residence allows it, try finding as many places to store books as possible. Stack em up as furniture, as suggested in another comment. Add a shelf running all around the place, just under the ceiling. Put your bed on risers and use the space underneath. Sacrifice some width in your living space and fill every wall you can with stacked books. If stability is an issue, use boards and bricks to make as minimalist a shelf as you can so you don't use up valuable book space. You'll be more of a fire hazard, but you'll also be well-insulated.

You might consider asking like-minded friends with extra space if you can put a bookshelf there, especially if you can fill it with books they would enjoy. Spread your library out.

For awhile in college my son, who also refused to let a book go if he didn't have to, kept the backseat of his car filled with the books that wouldn't fit in his apartment. Not a long-term solution, but it was the best he could do at the time. </TEXT>

That said, I don't like his reading voice. Maybe because it has some of the same nasal quality my own voice does, but when he reads I hear every "he said" and "she said" and I can never get into the flow of the story. The one audiobook I've ever returned was "Redshirts," for that reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a Heinlein fan and that is possibly the single worst book of his to start with. Not only does it build on previous books, without which it's even more difficult to follow, but you get all of his writing weaknesses without as many of his strengths.

One glaring problem with reading his work now is that progressive about women as he surely was, he was ignorant or dismissive of the idea of any genders besides the two. His women were brilliant, beautiful and world-class talented versions of the women in House Beautiful ads. If there were women in his stories that didn't eagerly want babies they were few and far between. Where were the "feminine men," the "masculine" women, the asexuals, or any of the many other types of people in the world? He briefly mentions a homosexual experience in "Beast" that was bland and unappealing, and in "Stranger in a Strange Land" one of his characters refers to homosexuals as "poor inbetweeners" who embodied a "wrongness." 

He had no problem accepting a woman as an equal -- or, more often, superior -- which was unusual and daring in his time, but he expected her to be a "very female woman."

ETA: Ah, now I have to refute myself. Thinking back, the judge and attorney in "I Will Fear No Evil" were unapologetically, happily bi or possibly ambisexual, there were suggestions of same-sex bundling between several main characters, and there were other ambiguities in there as well, including an ongoing question as to whether the protagonist would swing one way, the other, or both, which was never clarified. So he did acknowledge gay people, but they were still manly men gays and womanly woman lesbians or all-out hedonists, so that point still stands :) </TEXT>

Because he gave us a Death that makes the end of your life a satisfactory, fitting thing? Because he loves mythology and understands that every community, even the smallest, has its own?

Maybe because Sandman was such an amazing work at the right time? Maybe because he reads his own work very well? Maybe because he is remarkably accessible and was good at social media almost before it was a thing?

<TEXT> Roughly every fourth or fifth book I read is probably one I've read before. 

Many of the ones listed are in my re-reading standbys, but I'll add a couple I haven't seen yet. 

The Princess Bride, by William Goldman. Couldn't tell you how many times, now. 

The Discworld series. Some more than others, but all of them multiple times. 

Steven Gould's Jumper series (except for Griffin, the movie tie-in). 

The Guns of the South by Harry Turtledove. Love his short work, love his fantasy work, lost interest in the endless streams of WW-Whatever rewrites, but this one never seems to get boring for me. 

Jim Butcher's Codex Alera series. Love the Dresden books but these are better. 

Sherlock Holmes, although I prefer the stories to the novel. 

Stardance by Spider and Jeanne Robinson. 

The Moon is a Harsh Mistress by Robert Heinlein. 

Replay by Ken Grimwood. Struck a chord with me at the right time in my life and every couple of years I want to read it again. 

Good Omens by Terry Prachett and Neil Gaiman. Possibly the one book I can always pick up and enjoy reading again. Whatever the Venn diagram is for fans of this book, I am dead center.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Completely right. 

The thing people get wrong when they tell you it'll get better is that the pain never goes away. Nor should it. Instead it gets less and less intense as you gradually learn to accept it and focus on the memories rather than the loss. And because people say it gets better, you naturally figure there's some point when you're "better" and you can get discouraged if that's not happening, or if you think you're "better" but something reminds you and you're suddenly grief-stricken again. That's going to happen. 

You'll always be sad at losing them. Someday that will be just a wistful tug at your heart, followed by memories of what they meant to you. But for now feel what you want to feel, at whatever pace you need, and treasure the fact that you felt deeply enough about someone for it to hurt that match.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a fan of reading them in story arcs. Granted, I read them as they came out so it may be just what I'm used to, but I like jumping around the Discworld. 

It's true that the first two, "The Colour of Magic" and "The Light Fantastic" (really one big book split up) is the weakest one. It's more of a parody of fantasy novels rather than being the unique creation Discworld evolved into. But even the weakest Discworld book is hilarious and better than most others. You could skip those and come back, but you should read them before "Interesting Times."

Other than that, you can jump from any story arc to any other story arc without confusion as all the characters are introduced wherever they appear. Within the story arcs, you're better off staying in order as they build on one another.

Also? I envy you. I would love to read these again for the first time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It proves that I have a different opinion as to how the country should be run than the president and his supporters do. The news is accurate.

Is he cracking down on travel from a small group of countries in an apparent Muslim ban which causes hardship for innocent people and invasion of liberties while ignoring countries where terrorists who hurt us actually came from? Yes. But supporters want him to crack down and see this as a start. 

Is he systematically destroying our current government by putting people in charge of departments who, to a person, have spoken against, fought or sued that department? Yes. (Except for Ben Carson, who's there because... I don't know why he's there.) Has he left thousands of staff positions unfilled while putting his own people, unqualified apart from loyalty to Trump, in government offices? Yep. Has he left the State Department understaffed and unguided while he and his son-in-law handle diplomacy with the world? Also yes. But again, where I see this as insanely dangerous, his supporters see it as good and necessary for his vision to come true.

Is he stripping out every regulation he can find that protects consumers or the environment while getting ready to drastically defund the EPA? Big yes, and while supporters cheer this as helping businesses I'm remembering what the skies used to look like in New York and LA, and a river that kept catching fire...

The news I follow is accurate. It just doesn't scare you the way it does me. </TEXT>

Compliment him, help guide investigators away from his more obvious transgressions and profiteering, and he'll sign whatever you put in front of him as long as he can say he's making American great again. Also, they've come this far, don't underestimate the amount of humiliation they'll get as video clips of their eager support will be used against them forever. They are VERY aware of this, and re-election (and campaign funds) is more important than anything.

Pence might be problematic to them than Trump because he's a true believer. He honestly believes the stuff he says, and that's scary. </TEXT>

But I will add a quote you may already be tired of.

"To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. Nothing but the truth should be spoken about him or any one else. But it is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about him than about any one else."

<TEXT> As things stand now, 0%. The GOP controls the House, where impeachment begins, and as long as they can use him to ram through their corporate Christmas wishlist they'll keep supporting him.

If conclusive evidence is produced that ties Trump to Russian interests, maybe 20%. He and his machine will deny it, accuse the accusers, do their best to muddy the waters and throw smoke bombs and use every trick they can because Trump is incapable of admitting error or even seeing wrongdoing if he's the one doing it.

If Russian connections are proved AND he continues pissing money away AND he does something else to aggravate enough of the GOP: maybe 50%. They really, really don't want to own up to having supported an impeached president and will support him as long as voters seem to be on their side. Most of all, they don't want leftists to have been right.

If enough voters rise up against them, especially if GOP loses ground in the midterms because enough voters want him and them gone, odds go up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, first it depends on your tastes. I like fantasy and science fiction, and I recommend anything Neil Gaiman reads of his own works. Audible.com has a sale recently on the complete Sherlock Holmes, read by Simon Vance, who does an amazing job.

I have a 45-minute commute twice a day so audiobooks and podcasts have become a regular part of my life. People get really touchy when you go past on the highway, reading...

If you're interested in the Harry Potter books in the list you sent, it looks like they're the Jim Dale versions and he does a wonderful job. I'll listen to him read anything.

In odd science fiction I like "The Rook," by Daniel O'Malley.

There are books I like whose audiobooks don't work for me. I like John Scalzi and I like the actor Wil Wheaton, but his reading voice grates on me so I avoid them. Personal preference.

I'd say find the books that sound interesting, then listen to the samples to see if that's someone you want to read to you for a couple of hours.

The one I posted about was "The Night Circus," by Erin Morgenstern, also read by Jim Dale, which I loved. But I was talking about books in general and mentioned that, and was told it wasn't really reading a book. Even if I agree that listening isn't reading, the subreddit isn't /r/reading... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Books are ______. Ebooks are _______. Whatever you fill in the blanks with, it'll be wrong for somebody.

It's subjective, and always will be. I said the same thing when ebooks were getting started and all the articles were about the death of print.

Print books are wonderful. The heft and the smell and the physical sensation of turning the pages and the ease-of-reading for some people and the sentimental value and the ease-of-access and the way you can scribble notes in them and the ease of lending and the lack of batteries and the resale/bequeathing options and the way you can flip through pages to find things and the marvelous gifts they can be and how settling into a chair with a book and a cup of something hot can transport you and just the simple joy of having them on your shelves, all great things.

Ebooks are wonderful. The ease of purchase anywhere and at any time, the (generally) lower prices, the massive reclamation of storage and shelf space at home, the ease of searching within text, the ease of adding notes that can be emailed or texted or sent to Evernote or wherever, the built-in dictionaries, the ease of adjusting fonts and margins to taste, the hundreds of thousands of free public domain works available, the way you can knock off a few more paragraphs or chapters waiting in line wherever you are, the ease of copying passages to paste elsewhere, the ease of buying and sending as gifts, and the great joy of being able to carry hundreds around at all times, which for a reading addict such as myself is a damn miracle.

For some people or some books or some situations, print books are better. For others, ebooks. I've been gradually replacing most of my books with ebooks, thousands of them since I got my first Palm Pilot, but I keep the ones that I like better in print such as big art and photo books, books with amazing covers, frontispieces, maps or artistic binding, books that have been signed, books with sentimental value, books other people in the house want to read, etc. Meanwhile if I get the urge to re-read all the Discworld books (again) I've got them all in my pocket.

It's not an either-or. It never was. And neither one is going away. </TEXT>

He does excellent acoustic versions of songs he likes, and while he plays mostly rock I've been introduced to a lot of country that way. But his versions have no twang, no drawl, no steel guitar. I listened to Keith Urban because I loved this guy's versions of "Who Wouldn't Want to Be Me" and "Raining on Sunday" and sorry Keith, I liked his better.

<TEXT> That's really hard to say. It depends on my mood, whether I want to change my mood, whether I want to sing along, whether I want to pretend I'm playing one of the instruments, whether I want cool or intense or soothing or acoustic or funny... 

At the moment my phone is loaded with Pink Floyd (Roger Waters years), Aerosmith, Marian Call, Weird Al, assorted classic rock, Black Box Recorder, Matchbox 20, a lot of the covers from the "Californication" soundtracks, Foo Fighters (some I really like, some I actively dislike), Kansas, Lindsey Stirling, some of the piano covers from Westworld, Pink, some acoustic Coheed and Cambria, The Who, Nickel Creek, a few from Method Mouse, Paul and Storm, The Verve Pipe, The Beatles, Halestorm, a lot of stuff from local artists and friends, The Axis of Awesome, Queen, Stephen Lynch, a few from Porcupine Tree, Tim Minchin, some 2Cellos, and a few Keith Urban (but only because a friend does excellent acoustic, non-twangy versions of his songs and I want to learn the words) and the soundtracks to Pirates of the Carribean, Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, The Addams Family (Shaiman) and Hamilton. This will change constantly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Bechdel Test is a handy way for a writer to look at their own work, or for an audience to examine a book or movie or show, to see if women exist in it only as support to the male characters. It wasn't supposed to criticize all movies, nor was passing the test ever a guarantee of feminism or quality. 

When the movie's focus is a male character, the Bechdel Test likely won't apply and it can still be an excellent movie. When the movie's focus is on an event, or a group of characters, and the focus is *still* only on the men and what motivates them, that can be a sign that it wasn't very well written. The Bechdel Test, based on a cartoon conversation, was a funny way of pointing out how very, very many movies treat women solely as plot devices, exposition or just ways to motivate the male characters. 

Poking holes at the test does not invalidate the point of it, which is that for much of Hollywood's history women are less important to stories than men. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I need to know how to light people on fire.

Wait, let me try that again...

I need to know how to light people, who are near fire.

I shoot a local group of performers who use fire in many of their acts. Most of the time this is at night, with little available light around save perhaps lampposts. 

[I can get shots like this](http://imgur.com/a/Sn645), but I'd like to be able to narrow the aperture to get more detail in the flames and less blown-out white areas. BUT I need to be able to see the performers, and when I try a flash it takes away from the rich colors of the flames reflecting on their faces, hair and clothing. 

Ideally it should a portable, self-powered solution (or a better way of using my flash, which I admit I am not the best at) as they tend to move about quite a lot. Help? </TEXT>

<TEXT> After reading this and the [excellent guide posted below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/5dqyf2/an_rinstagram_guide_to_gaining_followers/), I spent the evening last night liking and commenting on other people's posts, especially people already following photographers who do similar work to mine. I also cleaned up my feed a little, deleting low-interest personal posts to help focus it a bit more.

Result: a bunch of likes, a few comments, and 10 new followers. Also, I found about 25 new photographers I wanted to follow, and saw a lot of great stuff. So, net win, I think :)

Going to try keeping this up for a week and see what happens. It can be pretty time-consuming, though.

One advantage of liking and commenting is that Instagram's recommendations for images I might like seems to be getting more accurate, and that can only keep improving. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends. For most images I have some presets to process pics the way I like right away, with only a bit of tweaking and cropping to do. For some images, especially portraits, I'll take more time -- say, 15 minutes to an hour -- to get it right. Images where I have to combine images, swapping heads or removing tricky things from backgrounds, etc, it could be a couple hours. And if I'm creating a photo illustration, I can keep coming back to it for days. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Go get a naked baby doll that stands up, or a mannequin if you have access to one, or even just something with smooth curves. Put it where you'll take the picture. Put lighting around it. Snap pictures. Move the lighting. Snap more pictures. 15 minutes of that will give you a lot of useful information about what lighting to use. Like the others here, I'd suggest from the side to get shadows. 

For that matter, set the timer on the camera and take pics of your own butt under different conditions. When you can make yours look good, you can make hers look great. 

Not light-related, but good to know for a straight-on butt shot: she doesn't need to stand straight and flat-footed. You can shoot that if she wants, but also try some with her putting one foot slightly forward, or crossing her ankles, or putting weight on one foot and cocking her hip up to make an s-curve with her body. Put her in high heels, or ask her to raise up on the balls of her feet. You won't see any of that in the pic, but you will see more attractive lines along her hips and her butt.

Edited: I wrote it wrong about closeness of the light vs softness of the shadows. </TEXT>

What this does, I think, is give you a heads-up of cool photos you might have missed in the stream and maybe goose you a little to like and comment on a fellow photog's work. If you get useful comments back, more the better.

By doing it inside Instagram rather than starting a thread here you immediately have access to comment because you're already in the program. Just more convenient, once you get the DMs set up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. People comng forward with information that could get them fired or worse are already taking a huge chance.

BUT I would consider it if the following conditions were also put in place:

- President Trump can no longer use any version of "a lot of people tell me" or "I heard this somewhere" or "someone told me this." He must name his sources, every time.

- Politicians in general cannot use any versions of "all Americans believe..." or "Americans want..." Not only this never been accurate, it has the added effect of implying that anyone agreeing with them is a "real" American and anyone disagreeing is not. If you were elected, you were elected to serve everyone in your district and you'd better be trying to do just that. </TEXT>

No, it does not mean that all, or even the majority of Trump supporters are racist bigots.

No, it does not mean that President Trump or any of his staff advocates this sort of behavior.

But it is true that attacks such as these have been increasing. It is true that many of President Trump's most extreme, most vocal supporters have said such things. It is true that he has been slow to denounce them, only specifically addressing it once and then after people kept commenting on his silence. It is true that the FBI's task force on terrorism was instructed to stop investigating white nationalist terrorists to focus exclusively on Muslim and IS.

So I don't see this one event as anything more than a drunken idiot, *by itself*. But I do see an ugly trend rising that we need to keep our eyes on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Be perfectly polite and as helpful as you can possibly be. If they have a legitimate gripe inside the rude behavior, address it with concern and understanding and ignore everything else. Several reasons for this.

1. It may defuse the situation. Sometimes when someone is being rude, they started off polite but got pissed when no one took them seriously or they felt they were getting the run-around. I've sent more than a few rude people away happy that way. 

2. You may discover an actual problem with your system or business and resolving it is a good thing which will head off customer problems in the future. If that's the case, you should not only fix it but thank them for pointing it out.

3. Anyone watching, including potentially your boss, will see that you did everything you could and are not at fault.

4. Other customers will be on your side.

5. If the customer is being rude just to be rude, it completely takes away their fun. They want drama, they want to make a scene, they want to get something for nothing, they want to get you upset because it's fun and because if you get rude back you justify everything they've been saying. Pissing someone off by being unfailingly polite is deeply satisfying and won't come back to bite you. </TEXT>

In the expansion of the illegal immigrant roundup memos, one of the changes was that immigrants would be detained as soon as they were charged, rather than after being convicted, and that [new detainment locations should be built immediately](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/trumps-immigration-detention-center-expansion). 

Sessions has announced that steps would be taken over states that have legalized marijuana.

It's the perfect combination for the GOP and the white nationalists that have moved in: get rid of the non-white people and the druggies, treat them horribly, and make money doing it.

<TEXT> It was a well-done show with a good mix of funny and dramatic elements, helmed by a guy who at the time could do no wrong and had a cult following already for his previous shows. Joss Whedon threw everything he had into this one, with a lightning-in-a-bottle cast and excellent writers, and his fans quickly loved this show about underdogs fighting against an unjust system and just trying to get by in the world. 

Then the network ran it out of order, pre-empted it every other week for local sports, canceled it, and THEN ran the two-hour premiere episode.

Now the online communities for Whedon's previous shows had grown and found each other and discovered the power of activism, something that was actively encouraged and promoted for the new show. Get lots and lots of people engaged in talking to each other and telling new people about a show, get them excited about it, and then have the show -- a show about misfits and exiles from society, mind you, people they identified with -- pulled out from under them: recipe for cult status.

When the DVD was released it broke sales records. All the episodes, in order, including the ones that weren't aired till much later, and (I think) every single one had some sort of commentary from the actors and creators of the show, all of whom are funny and charming and silly and appreciative of the fans. Now the fans could see what could have been and got even more pissed off. And they bought more DVDs and pushed them on friends and family. 

Being a Browncoat meant becoming part of a welcoming community for many fans. A decade later the show still tops "which show shouldn't have been canceled" lists.

Also, it's a really fun show. :) </TEXT>

In reality, women tend to get paid less for the same positions (your specific circumstance notwithstanding), they tend to get talked over in meetings, they tend to get overlooked in hiring in many industries, they tend to be treated as sex objects. It is an uphill battle getting many of those in law enforcement to take any rape besides the "crazed pervert" version you mentioned seriously. They often face enough harassment and condescension in the STEM fields that they are grossly underrepresented in those industries.

Basically, women are often treated, by default, as less than men in every particular. Obviously there are places where this is  not the case, and society overall is getting better about at least noticing and acknowledging it if not doing much about it, but the view of women as second-class still remains.

When women talk about rights, they know the rights are (mostly) already on the books. What they want is attention to the fact that those rights are being ignored far too often.

(By your request, I avoided abortion, even though that's a large part of why people are marching. The Oklahoma anti-abortion bill that a legislator defended by saying that pregnant women were host bodies is a perfect example of how many people feel about women.) </TEXT>

I really didn't expect it - with absolutely no medical justification, of course -- to come by surprise like that, so it was more shocking than it probably should have been. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Library books have been paid for, as has already been noted. But mostly it's a question of scale. Millions of people will not be reading that book at the same time; there's not much chance of a library copy of a book hurting the publisher's bottom line because even with a copy in every library in the world, there's only so many people who can borrow it at the same time. 

But when something is pirated and offered for download, millions of people can and do download it immediately and that can affect publishers. Spotify and Pandora and other streaming services at least pay the artists, even if not very much. 

Copyright issues aside, if it becomes easy to just take everything an artist creates, the only incentive for people to ever pay is because they want that artist to continue making more. Is that enough to sustain the art?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mostly jokes that are expressly racist or sexist, such as Eric Bolling's "boobs on the ground" comment about UAEs first female fighter pilot, Mariam Al Mansouri or a [teacher giving a black colleague a KKK robe](http://www.koco.com/article/elk-city-ag-teacher-apologizes-for-racist-incident/4311046). Jokes about rape that make fun of the victim rather than the rapist. Jokes about poor or homeless people, or the victims of police brutality. 

Granted, there are plenty of left-leaning people also making such jokes -- Justin Bieber and Steve Harvey both had to publicly apologize recently for jokes about racist stereotypes -- but generally when I see what I'd consider right-wing jokes or memes I see a lack of empathy for anyone outside the joker's immediate groups. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a counter to Schimmelhorn, check out Esther Friesner's "Chicks in Chainmail" series of short story collections, each one crammed with stories from writers a little tired of the female-warrior-in-the-chainmail-bikini trope.

One of the writers, Margaret Ball, had so much fun writing a story for one of the books that she wrote a whole novel on the subject, called "Mathemagics," where a fantasy warrior-woman came to this dimension so her kids could get a good education and had to learn how to deal with people here. Still has the sword, though... It's a light read but a fun one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Asprin's "Myth" books are very pun-filled, but his Phule series isn't.

Robert Sheckley was the funny science fiction writer from the late 50s to the mid-70s. Some of it may read dated now, but he was definitely an inspiration to later funny writers.

Esther Friesner wrote mostly fantasy, usually (but not always) with a funny touch.

You could also try Reginald Bretnor's Schimmelhorn stories. There's a collection, "Schimmelhorn File," and a novel, "Schimmelhorn's Gold," about a Swiss inventor and scientific genius who makes the most bewildering, bizarre inventions and chases girls until his wife catches him. Sexist as hell, but funny.

Other books I've liked: "How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe" by Charles Yu, Harry Harrison's Stainless Steel Rat series (great at the time, perhaps a little dated now, and don't read them in a row or they get repetitive, same for Keith Laumer's "Retief" books), John Scalzi's "Redshirts" (friends also like his Old Man's War series, I haven't tried it yet), "John Dies at the End" and "This Book Is Full of Spiders: Seriously, Dude, Don't Touch It" by David Wong, and. just to toss this in here. "The Princess Bride" by William Goldman. If you haven't read the book, even if you've seen the movie, read the book. </TEXT>

Robert Asprin's "Phule" series, anything by Robert Sheckley, any of Spider Robinson's short stories or Callahan books, half of Esther Friesner's work, "To Say Nothing of the Dog" by Connie Willis, the Red Dwarf books, even Poul Anderson's "The High Crusade" is based on a funny idea. 

You might also try comics. I'd put Warren Ellis' stuff up against any other funny sci-fi, especially "Transmetropolitan," "Planetary" and "Nextwave." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a version of this could be really interesting if told well, like an AU Harry Potter in a more realistic setting, but I'd make it clear it was an AU and simply wouldn't bring the abandoned bits up at all, rather than disparaging them. Or, say, a kid who grew up reading Harry Potter suddenly discovering the *real* wizarding world, which has some big differences...

There was a DC miniseries called "Superman: Secret Identity" where a kid named Clark Kent, presumably in our world, was getting really tired of all the Superman jokes and gag gifts he got every year. And then he developed super powers... It was very well done, with a slightly more "realistic" direction to it, but because it wasn't trying to rationalize the actual original characters it didn't come off as condescending. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  One of the great achievements of free society in a stable democracy is that many people, for much of the time, need not think about politics at all. The president of a free country may dominate the news cycle many days  but he is not omnipresent  and because we live under the rule of law, we can afford to turn the news off at times. A free society means being free of those who rule over you  to do the things you care about, your passions, your pastimes, your loves  to exult in that blessed space where politics doesnt intervene. In that sense, it seems to me, we already live in a country with markedly less freedom than we did a month ago. Its less like living in a democracy than being a child trapped in a house where there is an abusive and unpredictable father, who will brook no reason, respect no counter-argument, admit no error, and always, always up the ante until catastrophe inevitably strikes. This is what I mean by the idea that we are living through an emergency.

<TEXT> Honestly humor and ridicule seem to be the only way to get his attention. Millions of people marching are no big deal or he says they were paid to do it. He blows off any criticism and says "everyone" supports him. He does what he wants to do, even when it's not thought out or explained and even unconstitutional. 

But he cannot STAND to have his image questioned. He hates implications that he is not as rich as he says, he hates anything that threatens his alpha image (small hands), he hates anything that he thinks makes his staff look weak. It's been months since the election, he is the president of the United States, and he can't stop talking about how much he won and how many people were at the inauguration, even whipping up 3-5 million of illegal votes out of thin air without the slightest bit of evidence because he can't accept that he lost the popular vote.

The GOP is largely lockstep behind him. The Dems do not have the strength or, too often, the nerve to stop him. He seems to be systematically diminishing the worth of the media in investigating him (at least to his followers) and he clearly has no respect for the judicial system and I fully expect changes to come so that he can't be blocked again. 

Marches and protests and humiliation are pretty much our only weapons until the mid-terms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Previous bans were on specific groups of people coming from known high-risk areas, for a limited time, based on a recent occurrence, and even then people were let in if they passed evaluation. 

This ban is against seven countries that have not been implicated in terrorist crimes in the U.S. and ignores several countries whose countrymen have. And there no exceptions for people with green cards or people who have passed the extensive vetting already in place. 

Basically because it was a sloppily-written, too-vague law that seems less designed to protect the country and more to keep out members of a specific religion whether they're legally allowed to come here or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not like it's a tough thing to call.

The White House doesn't seem to care about violent attacks from pale people. None of them appear on their list of 78 terror attacks they say the press has underreported -- interesting news to the many news sites that covered many of them exhaustively, including a local TV news station that won an Emmy and one paper that won a Pulitzer for their coverage of some of the listed attacks -- and the task force charged with investigating all terror and hate groups has been repurposed to only look at Muslims. Hateful white terrorists are, apparently, no big deal. </TEXT>

Me, I shave along the top, on my cheeks, because growth is sparse there and I like it neater. I also shave the two spots under my bottom lip, same reason.

The rest of it I had been keeping trimmed but since Thanksgiving I've let it go to see what I get, only trimming loose flyaway hairs every now and then when they won't behave. I add some beard oil and don't shampoo it too often and so far it at least looks intentional :) </TEXT>

What I'd like is for President Trump to reveal his taxes and show that he has no current financial ties or obligations to Russia.

<TEXT> True, Haley did say that. That doesn't mean Trump believes it -- several people in his cabinet have said things contrary to things Trump has said. 

Trump has been belligerent to *everybody*, enemies and allies alike. That doesn't get him any points with me.

It is true that Trump has repeatedly praised Putin, talked about how strong and effective a leader he is. He has talked about weakening or abandoning NATO, which would greatly benefit Putin. A disturbing number of his cabinet and close advisors past and present have financial ties to Russia. He had flatly refused to condemn any of Putin's actions, dancing around the question whenever it has been raised. He has fought hard to minimize accusations of Russia influence on our most recent election.

Trump may not have anything to do with Putin, and Putin may have nothing on him. But Trump has not done even the easiest, most obvious ways to dissociate himself from Putin and I think it bears further examination. Also, ridicule.

However, he has written and said many things that are *also* believed by white supremacists and would-be fascists, and because he's gay, Jewish and dates a black man they embrace him whole-heartedly because he makes their side look marginally less white-male. 

Milo is very [anti-feminist](http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/10/07/full-text-milo-feminism-auburn/), [very anti-BLM](http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/12/13/milo-black-lives-matter-last-socially-acceptable-hate-group/), and [very anti-Islam](http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/09/27/10-things-milo-hates-islam/), and he delights in poking at people he feels are too sensitive until they react.

<TEXT> I use GMail for home and for work, and often I'll have tons of email to go through. And it drives me crazy. This may be tough to explain, but...

I read email A and need to keep it so I click on Email B. Email B I delete, and suddenly I'm back at email A again. I move down to email C, delete, and I'm back at A.  Every time I delete one, the focus goes back up one. But then I skip down to Email E and delete that, and now the focus moves down to Email F. Instead of the focus moving up, it moved down. Sometimes it goes one way, sometimes the other, and if I go too fast I end up deleting emails I wanted to keep. 

Assuming that makes any sense, is there any way to control this? </TEXT>

One writer has created a [Bruce-Wayne-in-High-School fic](http://archiveofourown.org/works/8524186) I like a lot, for example. But I'd also note that she doesn't have him meeting any other heroes or villains years before canon (he knows Zatanna, but there's no meeting Clark Kent 10 years before he's supposed to, that sort of thing) and she keeps him in character with some interesting insights into how someone damaged enough to eventually become a vigilante might socialize. 

But the farther away you get from the world the characters inhabit, the less I'm likely to be interested.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sherlock, but because it's not providing me with what I want: more stories in the same world. I've seen a few I liked, but there aren't a lot of witty, challenging mysteries being posted. 

No problem with various shippings, but I'd rather that the relationship not be the focus of the story. Not interested in reading about the characters working as barristas or in high school. I just want more Sherlock stories than Moffat/Gattis can provide and I absolutely do not understand why there aren't any official tie-in novels. Considering the source, collections of new short stories would be awesome. I suspect Doctor Who makes a pile off their books and some of them are excellent. Where are the Sherlock stories?

<TEXT> Clinton is irrelevant here. She is not president. 

Trump did hold an event for veterans, and he gave them the money [four months later](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/30/tomorrow-trump-will-give-more-details-about-his-donations-to-vets-heres-what-we-still-dont-know/?utm_term=.01f59189f3ed), which was a week after the Post ran a big article debunking his donation claims. This is on top of the Post exhaustively debunking his claim of the millions he personally had donated, [which they couldn't find](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-portrait-of-trump-the-donor-free-rounds-of-golf-but-no-personal-cash/2016/04/10/373b9b92-fb40-11e5-9140-e61d062438bb_story.html?utm_term=.bda1f832115e).

The tax returns are vital since we have no way of checking what conflicts of interest exist, or what Trump may owe to Russian companies or Chinese banks. "Trust me" is not a valid policy.

["And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia. There's indeed a lot of money coming for new-builds and resale reflecting a trend in the Russian economy and, of course, the weak dollar versus the ruble," Donald Trump Jr said.](http://www.eturbonews.com/5008/executive-talk-donald-trump-jr-bullish-russia-and-few-emerging-ma)

Trump has been [sued more than 3,500 times in the last three decades](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/) for not paying contractors. He told the Wall Street Journal,  "I love to hold back and negotiate when people dont do good work. If they do a good job, I wont cut them at all. . . . Its probably 1,000 to one where I pay."
[Here's why he gets away with it.](http://fortune.com/2016/09/30/donald-trump-stiff-contractors/)

 If you were voted in to be president based on a campaign of staying as a political outsider would you fill your most important cabinet seats with insiders?

He ran on the slogan of "draining the swamp." Apparently he drained it and hired everyone he found. He slammed Clinton repeatedly for her Goldman-Sachs interests but he hired two of them himself.

As for the better relationship with Russia, better diplomatic relations is fine. But he's right on the edge of toadying to Putin, and many of his staff (including, possibly, himself) have significant financial ties to Russia. The more he refuses to reveal those ties, the more I have to assume they're shady.

He's welcome to stack his room with people with constructive questions. Instead he's stacking it with people with fringe, pro-Trump, anti-fact websites. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of your counterarguments seem to assume that this money is being denied to clinics and such and people can just go elsewhere. In many places where these services operate, there *are no other medical options*, or there are very few. That's why they're there in the first place.

And they've all been told now that they may not even say the name of this legal, occasionally medically necessary procedure or they will lose the funding that enables them to perform many other needed services besides the one banned. For many of them that's no choice at all, they have to comply or shut down and not help anybody.

This is not based on science or medicine. This is an imposed choice by someone holding the pursestrings over millions of people's lives in an effort to ban a legal medical procedure because God or something.

Imagine the same gag rule, but about insulin. The Bible has a verse about medicine from sheep being bad or something, and the US has just said that any aid organization that even whispers the word "insulin" to a diabetic will lose its funding.

The organizations would probably go along, having little to no choice. Did the US force them to? No. But the reality of their situation forced them to, and the US put them in the position where that had to make that utterly unnecessary choice knowing full well what their answer would have to be. </TEXT>

Organizations providing aid to desperately needy people now have the option to provide them with all the information they need about the full range of medical options, but have their budgets severely slashed to the point where many would probably have to pack up and quit, OR they can keep the funding as long as they never ever ever ever even mention the option of a *completely legal procedure*.

Trump and the GOP are imposing their own moral beliefs on the world about a legal medical procedure and they are blackmailing/strongarming world aid organizations to do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We just adopted a lab mix dog from our local Humane Society. Wonderful, friendly, affectionate dog, but he's still clearly very anxious about being left alone. Has to know where we are and what we're doing at all time. We've been working with him and reassuring him and getting him used to where he lives now, but next week we have to take him back to the Society and leave him overnight for heartworm shots.

Is there anything we can do to help calm and reassure him before we leave him back where we just got him four days ago? We'll get him back the next day but I'm afraid we're going to break all the trust we've been building up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They have a mandate to promote and try to pass legislation that advances their goals, of course. They do not have a mandate to ignore the stated needs of over half their constituents. Trump does not have a blank check and should not be allowed to believe that he does. 

Which, I grant you, is silly. His whole life and career have been based on the notion that he can in fact do whatever he wants and it becomes OK or legal or ethical simply because he wants it, and it's worked for him. But a lot of what he wants requires the legislature, and they cannot be allowed to believe that all Americans agree with him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Along with the other comments here, there were other reasons to march in protest.

- To remind this administration that they do not have a mandate. This president did not win the popular vote. There are many millions of people who do not agree with the stated policies of Mr. Trump and the people under him despite his claims to the contrary, and this was just demonstrated in a way that cannot be denied although he's certainly going to try to.

- To remind themselves that they are not alone. For many people the months since the election, culminating in the inauguration day, were rough, emotionally black times. We have seen our countrymen enthusiastically cheer for and then elect someone to be president who is not only unqualified for the task but who demonstrates why he should not be in the White House every time he speaks or tweets, and we have seen him load the Cabinet with people who seem specifically chosen to destroy the department for which they were chosen. We have seen the various bits of wishlist legislation floating around that now have good odds of passing, bills that limit and restrict the tools of democracy while opening the gates to business. We read the proposed budget plans which seek to strip funding for many woman-friendly programs. It has been very easy, these days, to think that everything is lost. We *needed* this bright day of solidarity, of defiance, of triumph, of humor, of sister- and brotherhood. We needed to know that many millions of people agree. We needed to know that enough other people felt the same way that it would create the biggest single-day protest in the history of the world. This was catharsis.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off: I am not a lawyer. This is my opinion, based on current law.

You have the right to shoot anything you can see in or from a public place, or any privately-owned places where you have permission to shoot. 

Exception: You can't shoot through windows into private dwellings or public bathrooms. Illinois has the [Illinois Right of Publicity Act](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2241 ChapterID=62) that prohibits, among other things, shooting people where they have an expectation of privacy. 

However, a lot of places that seem public really aren't. Shopping malls, airplanes, theaters, amusement parks, schools, etc, all have property owners who may have restrictions on what can be shot there. There may also be restrictions at government facilities such as military bases, courthouses, museums, etc. If the owner or their designated representative (like a guard) asks you to stop or leave, you have to. Often public places with photography restrictions will have signs stating them, and you can always ask. Shooting at crime scenes is iffy and police can ask you to move away from the scene. 

On the street, you can take pics of anyone and anything, including kids, without model releases. I like shooting random scenes, little unscripted moments, myself. But don't do upskirt or creeper pics and don't get in people's faces for reaction shots: 1, it's annoying AF, and 2, you may get punched, and you'll deserve it. If I do shoot kids and their faces are visible, I always approach their parents or guardians after to see if they mind those pics being seen online. Some do, some don't. Some have bought prints. 

Keep in mind that if an identifiable person is the main element of your photo and you sell it commercially, that person may seek damages or a settlement for use of their likeness, especially if they are presented as an endorsement of a product or an advocate of a cause. The Illinois Right to Privacy calls this the "right of publicity."

Don't block walkways or streets, you can be charged for that. Some places, notably tourist attractions or rooftop restaurants in picturesque cities, prohibit tripods or any gear that uses a stand. 

Common sense is your guide, really. You can take amazing pics without breaking the law or pissing people off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because it was intended to bring healthcare costs down but wasn't given any real ways to make that happen. Since insurance and medical companies had no intention of lowering their profit margins without being forced to, rates went up and services went away.

Because there was such a concentrated effort to slam Obamacare over and over that people who got their information solely from low-information, high-anger websites and news channels believed it to be a disaster, even though many of those same people favored every individual element of it when they were told about them and the word "Obamacare" wasn't mentioned. 

For some, because it required companies to provide access to birth control and other women's services and they didn't want to.

For some, because being forced to pay for anything, no matter how good for society as a whole, is wrong. These are also the people who forgot what health care was like even 5 years ago, when the emergency room was still the health care of last resort for many and taxplayers had to cover that as well.

Because it is seen as a liberal initiative even though it was based on a Republican program, and the GOP flatly refused to have any input it on whatsoever. Efforts to make it more appealing to the GOP weakened the law, to no avail. (Goodbye, single payer.)

Because some people see any social program as someone taking money away from them to give it to someone who doesn't deserve it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just like with any other story that relies on an "impossible" element (time travel, superheroes, magic, etc) you can have whatever rules you want BUT they must be established up early on, you must stick to those rules, and you can't introduce new rules or exceptions at the end. Readers will put up with anything as long as they don't feel you're cheating or lazy.

Example: "Back to the Future." One of the most acclaimed time travel stories of all (sorry) time, and deservedly so, and it asks you to believe that making a change in the past s-l-o-w-l-y affects the future which can somehow be tracked with a fading photograph. But shouldn't any change be immediate? And if you do accept that the photograph reflects changes, why would his siblings fade? Shouldn't they either be there or not? Makes no sense.

But by establishing it up front and be scrupulously honest to the rules the story set up, with no last-minute cheating, the movie is fun and easy to understand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's been a favorite book of mine for many years, and I literally just finished listening to the audio version this morning (discovered you can listen to it in the Channels section of a popular audiobook website I apparently can't even mention by name without a bot asking me not to use sales links). 

It depends on your own interests and knowledge. He gets technical when he's talking about computers and ballistics, but the book is narrated by a man with a simple way of talking so that may not be a problem and you can always skim the techy bits.

However, Luna in the book is populated by people cast off from many countries of Earth and some of the language from many places has become part of Luna's language. Manny Garcia O'Kelly-Davis, the narrator, is part of an old Irish family but he speaks English with Russian phrasing and terms mixed in. Where the book has unusual words for an English-speaking reader, it's because they're words from a different language. Will this help or hinder you? No idea.

But I'd suggest trying it. Entertaining, informative and always seems relevant in different ways through the years. Also a weird combination of feminism and sexism, as Heinlein had a healthy appreciation for women's abilities and worth for his day but still tended to think in terms of woman=eager homemaker, no matter what other world-class skills she had.  </TEXT>

- Push through another Scalia right away, with more to come.
- Defund or eliminate any and all ethics oversight organizations that might point out what they're doing and how much it will cost. (Happening already; the very first move was to defang their main ethics committee and Gingrich is making noise about removing the non-partisan CBO)
- Pass federal laws about voter IDs, voting restrictions. redistricting, whatever allows them to remain in power.
- Refuse to investigate Russian connections with Trump, his staff or his cabinet.
- Get rid of the Iran deal.
- Ban abortions past 20 weeks (or entirely, if they think they can swing it) and defund Planned Parenthood. 
- Pass "religious freedom" laws that permit discrimination against homosexuals for any vague reason you can kinda sorta say is religious. (Several bills like this ready to go, most famous one also protects discrimination against unmarried straight people)
- Tax reform, i.e. if the rich keep more of their money everyone benefits, despite the fact that this has rarely, if ever, been seen to work in real life.
- Big push for charter schools and vouchers and more dumping on public schools.
- Strike down every regulation they can in the guise of encouraging the growth of business. Also deregulate banks and weaken the EPA, SEC.
- Change immigrations laws to be draconian, impossible to satisfy, and even lengthier. Strike down latest changes that allow children of immigrants to stay.
- Kill any transgender protections.
- Remove any and all references to or initiatives concerning climate change.
- Open up more oil and gas drilling, build the Keystone pipeline.
- Privatize everything. Particularly Medicare.
- Double down on the war on drugs and increase the use of privately-run prisons.
- Kill Net Neutrality.
- Haven't seen any recent calls for this, but bringing back abstinence-only sex ed and the bible to schools is always a perennial favorite.

An incomplete list, off the top of my head. And to many people, these are all good things. I don't understand these people, I probably never will. But every one has clear, observable, measurable harm, and I expect to see movement on every one of them the first year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As many have pointed out, you'll run into problems designating who gets this training.

I suggest instead that we work harder to remove the stigma of vocational training for everyone. It should not have the can't-hack-a-real-job reputation it has now. We NEED trained people to do essential tasks and how dare anyone look down on anyone in a blue-collar job. 

School counselors should be recommending it to anyone who may have an aptitude for it.  Bring back wood shop as an elective to let more students gets exposed to working with their hands and see who takes to it. Start apprenticeship programs with schools. Make carpentry and plumbing and electrical work and construction and even just damn digging respectable again.

When students (and, just as importantly, parents) don't feel they're being pushed into being second-class citizens with nothing else to offer, more will choose to do jobs appropriate to their abilities and their interests. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  However he seems able to change his mind like he promised with Obamacare. He cares A LOT about what his voters think of him and has less allegiances than usual politicians.

Trump treats every engagement, whether it's an argument or discussion or business meeting or press conference or political rally or flirtation, as a confrontation. And he will do whatever he thinks he has to do, say whatever he thinks he has to say, to win that confrontation at all costs. Doesn't matter what he said before. Doesn't matter what consequences there might be in what he says. Won't make much of a difference in what he says tomorrow. He has no core beliefs, other than "Donald Trump is better than everyone else in the world." All that matters is that he wins, and he's *seen* winning, at every turn, and anything that undermines that is either viciously attacked or completely dismissed as fake.

That doesn't make him fair-minded or open to change. It does make him open to parroting the beliefs of people who flatter or benefit him, and it encourages him to spout jingoistic nonsense because that makes crowds love him and cheer. It makes him dangerous and unpredictable. It means that in his mind he is not capable of doing anything wrong, because if he wants it by definition it's OK. 

I can't think of a more dangerous person to be in charge of the country. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A common thread I've noticed, in the operators that seemed the best at it, was that they all seemed eager to help. They were calm, they were patient, but most of all they sounded like they had absolutely nothing to do at that moment besides help this particular caller get though this. That's why I noticed your wording there, which was friendly and in just a few words gives the message "I'm on your side." The ones that (maybe) made things worse were brusque, or cold, or impatient, or (in a few cases) dismissive. And when an operator fails to say, right up front, that help is on the way, I already know how badly the rest of the call is going to go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because FOX, and the GOP, simply don't consider him a real president. Never have. They don't believe he is a legitimate president and do not wish to offer him the respect he is due.

Contrast this with, say, the New York Times, which refers to everyone on first reference with an honorific.

(In years past I might have softened that with "the extreme factions of the GOP" but it's been awhile since any moderates dared raise their head. If there are any left.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Liberal" has been used as an insult by detractors for many decades, but it wasn't until the Reagan years in the 80s when politicians began paying more attention to their television appearances and there seemed to be more of a concentrated effort to make "liberal" seem like a horrible thing to be, rather than just a different point of view.

In the 90s, Newt Gingrich (and one of his staff, Frank Luntz) [wrote a memo](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4443.htm) advising Republicans how to word their statements to get the most impact. "The words and phrases are powerful. Read them. Memorize as many as possible. And remember that like any tool, these words will not help if they are not used."

Positive words on the list included building, change, children, citizen, common sense, courage, family, hard work, opportunity, pro- (issue): flag, children, environment, prosperity, strength, we/us, etc.

Words to be used when talking about Democrats and their issues included abuse of power, anti- (issue): flag, family, child, jobs, "compassion" is not enough, corrupt, criminal rights, disgrace, failure, greed, hypocrisy, intolerant, permissive attitude, sensationalists, steal, taxes, they/them, traitors, welfare, and, of course, liberal.

The rise of talk radio in the 90s and cable news in the 00s helped speed the process up considerably. Rush Limbaugh spent years denouncing liberals as the source of everything evil in the world, and FOX picked it up and ran with it. Yell anything long enough and people will start to believe it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two notable ones, one of each:

I worked at the service desk of a building materials store. Late one night, maybe 15 minutes before closing, two guys and a woman were strolling through. One man was walking next to the woman, talking to her, and the other was walking behind. He was also holding up her skirt so that her nude rear end was exposed as she walked. She appeared unaware of this. 

After they passed, my buddy and I discussed the likelihood of whether she knew about it and what might happen when she found out. A few minutes later they came back around. The men looked extremely ashamed and she was walking behind both of them, furious. I suspect there may have been hitting.

Other was my friend at a medieval re-enactment campsite around a crowded fire late one night. Lots of people there and nearby. My very drunk friend was wearing a kilt, and someone asked if he was wearing anything under it. He promptly pulled it up to his chest, checked, and then said "No!" I'm calling it accidental because he was far too gone to realize he'd just casually and slowly flashed about 60 people and had to be told about it the next day. By about 60 people. </TEXT>

Other personal favorites include Alan Dean Fosters' "Mad Amos" stories, Orson Scott Card's Tales of Alvin Maker series (although the last couple weren't as good, to me), and Mark Sumner's "Devil's Tower" books.

I prefer a sense of humor in even the grimmest of tales -- usually makes the dark parts darker -- and I look for ornery antiheroes. Where should I look next? </TEXT>

<TEXT> "First, do no harm."

Medical personnel have a much older responsibility. And while in many places this can be tolerated since there are other sources of medical aid, in some areas of the US there are not other sources in manageable distances. Is it right that a trans person could show up at an ER and get turned away? What about women who use birth control prescribed for other reasons besides birth control? I can maybe see allowing refusal for general practitioners or for optional services, but not for medically necessary services. </TEXT>

We vote. We get more people to vote. We get these people out of office before they can screw things up too badly or too permanently.

We run for office ourselves. One reason for the recent resurgence in the GOP is that they've been campaigning hard for local offices, city commissions, county councils, school boards, etc. Grass roots starts there, and that's where political leaders come from. The current president-elect excepted, of course.

<TEXT> Sexuality is a spectrum. A lot of 'em, really, but lets we're talk about two: sexual preference and sex drive. 

Most people are in the heterosexual part of the preference spectrum, but a significant percentage is gay and quite a few are somewhere along the line in between. 

Sex drive is all over the map -- google "how much sex a week is normal" to find thousands of people concerned they're not doing it right -- with some on an extreme end where sex is all they think about, and some are asexual with no interest in it at all. 

This is not abnormal. People are not either-or anything, and when you have a curve you have outliers. Simple as that. 

Not to say it's not causing you problems, but I'd suggest accepting it and going into relationships honestly. Trying to build a relationship where you'd be faking it the rest of your life is a recipe for misery.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> At various times in my life I've had hair halfway down my back, hair to my shoulders, hair cut short and hair buzzed to a quarter of an inch (my style for the last five years or so), but this is the first time I've buzzed it all off. The process was simple.

1. Decide one day to let my neatly-trimmed beard grow out for the hell of it, to see what it would look like.

2. Enjoy the bushier beard, resolve to go full-Santa and let it go until I am forcibly stopped or it becomes an impediment to driving.

3. Begin to wonder if I shouldn't just put all my attention on the beard, where hair still works, and give up entirely on my head. To be fair, the hair on my head gave up on me first.

4. Google head-shaving, tips on shaving your head, products to use when shaving your head. Read this subreddit for a few days, note that virtually everyone's before-and-after pictures look better after. 

5. Ask wife what she thinks. She's fine with whatever I want to do with it, although she does point out that I started clipping my hair short and stopped shaving to give myself less to do in the morning, and this would increase my grooming time. A fair and accurate point, which I shall completely ignore.

6. Keep thinking about, but not doing it, for several weeks. 

7. Finally decide to do it for New Year's, both as a symbolic new start to the year and because I have a three-day weekend and that gives me time for any weird blotches or cuts to fade.

8. Having said that, skip the first day off.

9. While shopping at Walgreens the next morning, find myself hovering around the shaving products aisle. Pick up some Nivea cooling post-shave balm, no reason, la dee da.

10. Stare at myself in mirror. Take "before" pictures. Stare again. Wonder if I'd get better light for "before" pictures in a different room. Wonder if I slapped myself for stalling, would it open pores or close them?

11. Get out clipper. Wonder if I shouldn't wait till spring.

12. Quickly buzz line from crown down the back of my head, to stop self from stalling. Congratulate myself on taking plunge, but resolve to buzz the rest a bit more slowly because ow.

13. Buzz rest of head, check in mirror, snip and trim bits I missed. Shower.

14. "After" pictures. Note that I don't look especially different, at least from the front, as I was already trimming it short. Feel cooler. Smoother. Lighter. More aerodynamic.

15. Show wife, who says it looks good. Wife is almost a foot shorter than I am so there may not be a whole lot of difference from her angle, either, but I'll take it.

I'll try shaving it bald tomorrow, I want to give my head a day to recover. It really was more of a psychological hump to get over since I was just one setting away from cutting it that way anyway, but it does make a difference in how I see myself. Also, wispy bits of hair on the top of your head are not worth keeping.

Thanks to everyone here for your unknowing support as I lurked and read your stories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's kind of sad that people's happiness was so reliant on sexual discrimination. I do note that you're conjoining the study you posted and some other one about women's happiness with the clear idea that one correlates with the other, with no evidence for that connection.

Also, no mention of any other events of the past 50 years that might impinge on people's happiness, such as numerous wars, changes in the economy that make supporting a family, advancement and retirement much more difficult than for earlier generations, increasing dissatisfaction with government, the increased awareness of problems and misery all around the world thanks to cable news and the Internet...

 Why should women waste time collecting resources instead of creating a new generation?

Because they want to? Because they are more suited to that? Because it challenges them? Because they have something to offer? Because they have no interest in producing or raising children? Because they cannot afford to live on one income, and if you're working you should be treated fairly? If a woman -- or a man -- wishes to stay home and raise kids, or volunteer, or be a teacher, they should be able to. But by their own choice, not because they are genetically required to.

It's not about making women subservient, it's about creating a culture that encourages people to do what fits them best genetically.

How about just creating a culture that encourages people to do what fits them best? 

If a woman has no maternal feelings, no desire to be a mother, no skill at it, would you force her to raise a baby anyway? Or would you encourage her to find what she is suited for, and do that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> People who dislike feminism have decided that feminism is an extreme ideology. Doesn't make it so, although apparently if enough people say it you get the same result. 

From Wikipedia: "Feminism is a range of political movements, ideologies, and social movements that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social rights for women. This includes seeking to establish equal opportunities for women in education and employment."

<TEXT> Well, that is certainly a general assumption. I don't agree with it, and I don't see how you can justify or prove it, but it is certainly an assumption. It's actually a lot of assumptions. Apparently all feminists are exactly the same, and all men are exactly the same, and all women are exactly the same, and you know what they all think. I'm impressed.

(For what it's worth, I did the same thing when I mentioned MRAs. Some MRAs are not anti-woman, they're actively working against legitimately anti-man things like bias in custody settlements. But like feminism, the term MRA is rapidly becoming synonymous with its most outrageous, idiotic members.)

For a lot of people, things *are* better than they were. Sexual assault is taken more seriously. More women are in positions of power and responsibility. Sexism and condescension in the workplace is becoming less acceptable. Relative payscales are being looked at, if not actually getting changed much yet. 

Most (not all) of the people who seem to complain the most about feminism are people who want women to shut up and stay where they belong. If anything threatens that, I can see why they'd think "it's never been worse." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most anti-feminist men, in my opinion, either want women kept in a subservient position (not many, I don't think, but they tend to be the loudest and most obnoxious) or are defining "feminism" by the stupidest, most extreme things anyone who called themselves a feminist has ever said. Those are the people who think feminism is anti-man, and if they really believe that then there's no wonder they're scornful. 

The bulk of feminists believe that woman should get the same opportunities as men, and should not be discriminated against because they're female. That's kind of it. I'd like to think an anti-feminist might change his or her opinion if they talked to a feminist, but I'm not sure a lone voice can be heard against the wail of the MRAs.

I have more sympathy to people who prefer to consider themselves humanists, wanting equality for all, but I think that while that's also a feminist goal, disdaining feminism in favor of that ignores the context that made feminism necessary in the first place. Like telling people to stop trying to raise awareness of cancer because we should be fighting against all disease. Accurate, but too vague to be useful. </TEXT>

Even aside from wishing death on someone makes your soul all sticky, his death would accomplish two things:

1. Mike Pence would be president, an arguably worse outcome.

2. Trump would become a martyr to his followers.

Then we'd never be rid of him. They'd make friggin' shrines to him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You mentioned in another comment that you'd already bought it so you don't need more convincing, but I will say this: while it works perfectly well as a standalone series in its own right, the more you know about Golden and Silver age comics and pulp novels, the more blown away you'll be by this. It's Ellis and Cassidy poking fun (and honoring) the huge, overblown ideas of comics creators in the last century and every issue is a tribute of some sort.

Also make absolutely sure you get the Planetary/Batman crossover one-shot "Night on Earth." Easily one of my top five Batman stories and just talking about it makes me want to read it again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Let's say we're playing poker. You know that half the deck is red cards, so if you get 10 black cards for every one red card, you're going to think something is fishy. No matter how much I shuffle and cut the deck, if you keep getting 10 black cards for every one red, you're going to say the game is rigged - and you'd be right.
 Quotas seem like a shitty solution, and they are - if you insist on 2 red cards for every 3 black cards, you're not solving the root of the problem, and you're going to be tossing out a lot of fair hands. (Also, you can't get a flush, but that's kind of overextending the metaphor.)
 However, the whole point of a quota is that if the game isn't rigged, then you won't need to work to fill your quota. If a quota is a burden, then somewhere in your hiring process you're stacking the deck, and the solution should be to fix that rather than complain about the quota.

Just want to point out this is one of the best explanations of quotas I've ever heard. They're not fair, no, but the need for them points out an unfair situation. </TEXT>

Blacks are not responsible for 90% of all murders. The FBI numbers for 2014 have them responsible for 90% of all *black* murders. Also, whites are responsible for 82% of all white murders, cuz, you know, you're more likely to kill people in the same neighborhood as you. 

As for police letting it continue... The police I know fight to solve every murder they can. That's kind of insulting, assuming that all police are so racist and uncaring, isn't it?  </TEXT>

But yeah, the Constitution should block such things. People can have religion but governments should not. If something like this did pass, I'd fight at least to have medical, emergency services and government offices exempted from it.

<TEXT> Barely a quarter of Americans were motivated enough against a candidate who was part of "the system" to vote for Trump. You have not proven that the system has let everybody down (especially since unemployment is down and the Dow has been at record highs for a long time now). 

Enough people were fed stories and fear at a time when politicians seem incapable of working with each other and not enough is being done to help American workers whose jobs have gone away. I think that says more or less the same thing you did, but is more defensible. 

The problem is that enough voters were so in favor of anyone outside "the system" that they elected someone who can bring it all down without considering the pain and problems this will cause. </TEXT>

(Hair's not growing on the top anymore, might as well go with what still works.) I'm well on my way to a Santa beard, and running into all the problems I've seen here already: stiff hair, flaky skin, etc. I've taken the advice and used conditioners and beard oil, rinsed in cool water, etc. and that helps a lot. But how often should I be doing this?

I shower every morning. I live in a hot climate. Should I be washing my beard with the same regularity, or should I skip days to let the natural oils come back? How often should I use the beard oil? I'm not after a shaped look, just a soft mass. Suggestions? </TEXT>

2) I wasn't aware making it easier was the important part. If there are roughly equal numbers of white kids and black kids doing drugs and you're arresting mostly the black kids, something is wrong.

<TEXT> From the article:

 Law enforcement in Alachua takes the war on drugs to the black communities, targeting those with darker skin for petty infractions that ultimately spur a drug search. Three-quarters of those arrested for misdemeanor pot by the Gainesville Police Department in 2014 and 2015 were black. The stop-and-search tactics produce at least one arrest every day - a constant pressure that has left the black neighborhood feeling persecuted and fatigued.
 - At the university, police are less aggressive in their search for drugs, relying instead on complaints. Even then, few minor drug busts end in arrest and even less in conviction. Unlike the black neighborhood, students feel police are there to protect them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Couple of my personal favorites are:

**Steel Beach** by John Varley, a sprawling story of a journalist in the years after Earth was invaded and humanity had to move out to the moon and other planets. Nanobot tech is ubiquitous and the main character changes genders midway through (time for a change). Also, the computer intelligence that runs everything and is everyone's best friend might be going insane. The book **The Golden Globe** is set in the same universe, a few years later, and follows an actor trying to get from Pluto to the moon in a ridiculous amount of time (and with no money) to play the role of a lifetime, followed by an unstoppable assassin with a grudge. Both are funny, thought-provoking and hard to explain.

**Jumper** by Steven Gould, and its sequels. Forget the movie, the book is amazing. Main character discovers he can teleport to anywhere he can see or remember, and the book is about him working out all the ramifications and uses of this skill. Also about dealing with an alcoholic, abusive father, a mother who abandoned him, and, oh, yes, terrorism.

<TEXT> I'm a big fan of Bendis' early work before Marvel, and I think his Daredevil run, "Alias" and "Ultimate Spider-Man" are some of the best books ever done. But his team books got repetitive really fast and his crossovers actively annoy me.

Agreed on the annuals. Those were fine, and often fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 51-year-old dude, been reading comics since I was six. I have bought a *lot* of comics over the years. And the Big Two finally broke me from my character loyalty in the last decade with the nonstop annual crossover EVERYTHING WILL CHANGE AND SOMEONE WILL DIE PROBABLY cosmic whatever events.

I don't care who dies anymore. I don't care which character will never be the same for about six months anymore. All I know is that the crossover events broke the monthly books. Writers can't get a story arc going because the characters will get sucked into whatever new mega-event the editors came up with at last year's retreat, for months at a time.

A few years back -- I think around "Brand New Day," which is its own rant -- I stopped following characters completely after decades of faithful purchasing. I've stopped following hero books almost entirely, except for the ones where they're not really influenced by crossovers and the creative team stays the same. Instead I follow writers. I go look for Moore, Fraction, Liu, Waid, Simone, Ellis, Vaughn, Wilson, King, etc., and just follow them from publisher to publisher. Saves me money and I'm guaranteed good comics.

But the companies wouldn't keep doing this if it didn't pay off. Has anyone here been brought in by crossovers? Has anyone found new books to buy because of them? Where are the success stories? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  As for Trump, and I'm definitely not trying to defend him, he is actively distancing himself from his various businesses, so he's not trying to "rake in the cash."

No, he is *saying* that he is actively distancing himself from his various businesses. Not the same thing. There has been no proof of this, and I don't see how he can distance himself anyway.

He still knows what they are and what they do. He knows which countries his businesses deal with, and he knows what deals are already in progress or have been held up. He knows where his hotels and golf courses are. *They have his frigging name on them.* He has a hotel near the White House, where visiting dignitaries may be staying. It is simply not possible for him to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest even if we did grant him the benefit of the doubt, which I am not willing to do. 

MAYBE if he had released his tax returns so we knew about those business dealings ourselves before the election, or even now. MAYBE if he proved that he sold his stock months ago as his people now say he did, without a bit of evidence. MAYBE if he put his companies into a true blind trust. MAYBE if the first thing he did after winning hadn't been to contact all the heads of state in countries he had businesses in. MAYBE if he hadn't canceled the press conference he'd called to talk about his business plans and postponed it till after the Electoral College vote. MAYBE if he hadn't spent his whole business career running up debts, stiffing contractors, filing for bankruptcy and walking away. But he has given us absolutely no reason to believe him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First thoughts:

- I'm betting we've seen most of the RDJ scenes right there.
- Really don't like Ned Leeds. Nothing against the actor, but this was stolen straight from the Miles Morales run. If you want a Miles Spider-Man, make a Miles Spider-Man.
- People complaining about the cruise ship scene giving it away: this happens with every MCU movie. Guaranteed that will not be in the final scene, it's probably from some mid-point action scene. I doubt we've seen anything from the final scene yet.
- Love the Bruce Banner shoutout.
- What I'd really like to see, by the end of this? Parker moving past Stark's design and developing his own costume. He should close out the movie swinging toward us in something closer to the classic look.

<TEXT> That's part of why I do like the show. Hamilton was a dick to many people, and the show doesn't hide that. Few of the characters are just one thing, really, and that's rare in any story.

I think it's important that we understand the founding fathers were imperfect, human. People have not changed, really. We've always had politicians who were at odds with each other, often loudly. The country was created out of a consensus that was hard-fought. We didn't have these paragons of virtue and then suddenly our politicians all went insane the last few decades. 

It's important to know that they were just like us, and they still accomplished what they did. It means that we can do it, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's pitched as a hip-hop musical, but it is and it isn't.

"Hamilton" uses the style and language of hip-hop and rap to tell its story. Miranda used the fast cadences, multiple rhymes in the same line and the rapidfire delivery of rap but the subject matter is at turns dramatic, funny, and heartbreaking. It's rap the way Gilbert and Sullivan would use it, and there are some shoutouts to G S in there, too.

Miranda put out a Spotify playlist of songs that inspired him when he was writing "Hamilton." I loved "Hamilton," so I listened to it. Nope. Still don't like hip-hop.  

It's not three hours of gangsta rap. You won't feel like you walked into the wrong club. And while rap is used in many of the songs, there is also rhythm and blues, jazz, and one or two songs that would fit perfectly in a Disney movie (OK, a pretty funky Disney movie, but still.).

You still may not like it -- my wife doesn't -- but you might be surprised. A lot of people have been. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could cast a white man as an Asian in a movie right now. Nothing is stopping you. Your artistic vision is your own and you don't have to change it to please anybody.

But if your artistic vision includes the most over-the-top racist stereotype you can produce -- such as Mr. Rooney's I.Y. Yunioshi -- you're going to get flack for it. Freedom of expression has never meant freedom from criticism.

If the Hamilton actors were portraying the founding fathers with "white guys do this" types of jokes and physical humor, giving themselves deformed Caucasian appearances and mocking white people in general, you might have a case. Instead they portrayed them with respect and depth and brought them alive for millions of people.

Black people playing traditionally white characters are still a tiny part of the whole thing. White actors aren't hurting because of it. A black actor getting a powerful role is still a noteworthy thing.

White people getting cast in the role of a POC takes jobs away from the relatively tiny pool of available jobs for POC actors, and it reinforces the stage, TV and movie cliche that the default color for human beings is white. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Out of context, it does seem unfair and weird.

But when the vast majority of actors throughout the history of western TV and movies have all been white, with other races mostly relegated to playing stereotypical bit parts or villains, it's powerful for people of color to see people who look like them on the stage and on the screen playing roles that have weight and depth. And taking a classic role portrayed by a POC and giving it to a white actor instead of any of the many qualified POC actors seems like a step backwards.

Similar to asking why there's no White History Month, White Entertainment Television or why white people can't use the n-word when black people can. The question only makes sense if you ignore the last couple hundred years, which many people seem quite happy to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The level playing field of the Internet will be gone.

Bigger sites will be able to pay for faster content delivery. New startups and your own homemade site? Slower, less reliable.

ISPs could charge different rates for different services, and it would become more like cable. Your cheap package might not get the good websites, especially the media-heavy ones.

Bundling like that could be even more invasive. Suppose you want Netflix but to get it you have to also use Bing? What if a business deal resulted in the high-speed Hulu only being available to Comcast users?

Once ISPs start curating website access, if they do, then pressure to blacklist unwanted sites will be huge. Porn, torrent sites, and other questionably legal sites are obvious targets, but some people may pressure local ISPs to block information on abortion, birth control, news sites they don't like, dissent, etc. 

One common theme for Trump and the people he is choosing is that business is more important than anything else. Privatize infrastructure, reduce regulations, promote charter schools and vouchers over public education. If there is a way to make money, it will happen, and the freewheeling, open nature of the Internet will be gone.

<TEXT> Because people on welfare need to be punished, apparently. Because success and wealth are easily available for anyone willing to work, as everyone knows, so people on welfare must be lazy and are probably deliberately gaming the system to buy drugs. Because success and wealth are proof God loves you, so anything you do to sinners is OK. Because being seen to be tough on welfare cheats -- even when you have to create the idea of massive welfare cheating yourself to do so -- plays well with your base. And sometimes (hello, Florida) because you have relatives who profit from the testing kits or labs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> - Stricter voting laws, more purges of voter rolls, more restrictions on same-day registrations, early voting, etc. 
- More anti-abortion laws. 
- Privatized infrastructure that results in sweetheart deals to friends and very few new highways or bridges. 
- Privatized schooling that benefits unaccountable charter and religious schools and further impoverishes public education. 
- Religious freedom laws that do not block gay marriage but that allow people (including pharmacists, county clerks, hospitals, etc) to refuse them service. 
- Complete defunding of Planned Parenthood. 
- Evisceration of Obamacare. 
- Increased deportation of illegal immigrants with criminal records. 
- Elimination of any efforts to combat or even study climate change. 
- Tax changes that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy. 
- Relaxed regulations for business. 
- Slashed funding for the EPA or any consumer protection groups. 
- Reduction in investments for clean energy, increased attention to "clean" coal. 
- The end of Net Neutrality and increased ease of government to break into your email and phones. 
- Reduced support for UN and NATO.

I'm not so worried about what Trump has said he'll do because he changes opinions to win whatever conversation he's having at the moment. But everything on that list is something that the GOP wants, and several of them are pet projects of the people he's chosen for his cabinet. Some of them can be done just by the department's secretary deciding what to focus on and what not to enforce. 

I don't actually expect Trump to govern at all. I expect him to grow into the banana republic dictator he's been bred to be and come out of the job far richer than when he went in thanks to the many international deals that will magically happen. 

(Edited to put in list form and add a few more things.) </TEXT>

That's about it. If there are any problems you can take off their backs or anything to ease their day-to-day needs, quietly and unassumedly go for it.

<TEXT> Big, big fan of Allen Steele and John Varley. Big space ideas, but with very fallible humans out there. Try "Orbital Decay" or "Steel Beach." "Steel Beach" is one of the books I re-read every year or so.

If you like idea books, try Robert J. Sawyer. After awhile his characters and plots tend to run together -- his protagonists are all unique, as long as they also are all Canadian professors who like Star Trek, and he takes these mind-stretching ideas and then drops a murder or something in them -- but he is excellent at coming up with interesting ideas and seeing where they go. What happens if aliens land and someone kills one? "Illegal Alien." How would it change humanity of you could prove, conclusively, the existence of a soul? "The Terminal Experiment." How would we accept an alien visitor who believed in creationism and had proof? "Calculating God." What if the Internet woke up and was, despite popular culture warnings to the contrary, benevolent? The WWW trilogy. What if the majority of humans weren't really conscious, a smaller percentage were sociopaths and the smallest percentage were people with a conscience? "Quantum Night," and some of the musings in that one resonated a little too closely to current events for me.

I like Sawyer's work almost despite Sawyer, his website and social media are nonstop promotion for himself. Or at least they were, I haven't looked in years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really think we can have a serious discussion with that question, and I really, really doubt anything I or anyone else could say is going to change your opinion as stated since we're not starting from the same assumptions (or, possibly, realities), but here's this:

"The devil made me do it" is hogwash. Putting the blame for the actions of human beings on external sources -- whether it be demons, Satan, cursed books, what have you -- gives the humans who performed the deeds an excuse, and it can blind people to the real dangers of ordinary people. The guy who looks perfectly normal could be a sexual predator. The religious leader or parent or youth group leader who could never do such things because they're so nice could be a pedophile. Blaming any evil influence takes the blame away from the people doing the acts, and I do not agree with that. 

It also allows people to rise up against other things they consider to be evil, since it's clearly a general rise in evilness that's causing all those problems and not just, say, some twisted son of a bitch, and then you get programs against kinds of music or sexuality or whatever misguided people decide they hate this month.

People are responsible for their actions.  </TEXT>

That said, the Big Two's reboots, rebirths, cross-promotions and other demographics-grabbing schemes have scared me off of most cape books for the last 10 years.

2. After last night's episode, looks like it was Arnold.

3. We don't know yet.

4. He talks to him in episode 5, but never names the MiB. He talks to Teddy, mentions Wyatt, and quotes Sir Walter Scott as he goes past Teddy: "Mr. Flood, we must look back and smile at perils past."

5. Apparently because WW has all-new staff, Arnold was reclusive, and I guess there were no bio pics on the company website? This is one of the weaker parts of this reveal.

<TEXT> Couple thoughts and questions.

Pretty sure MiB is William, or it'll be one hell of a fake. I think they're going to give us that one but surprise us somewhere else.

Also think Ford is setting Mauve up to be the new Bernard. But I'm not positive Bernard is dead. Hosts get shot all the time. Delores already shot herself in the head at least once. (And did Ford tell her to, way back when, or was that her last sentient decision that first time?)

Where did the "Arnold is Ford's father" theory come from? That seems way out of left field to me.

Still a little sketchy to me that no one recognized Bernard/Arnold. Even if you accept the theory that everyone working for Westworld is new or a host, what about the outside world? 

I kinda hope Ford ends up being the good guy, if for no other reason than to play against Anthony Hopkins' type. </TEXT>

Because about 12 years ago some department stores asked their employees to say "Happy holidays" instead of "Merry Christmas" to be more inclusive of their shoppers, and Bill O'Reilly blew it up into a war on Christmas that FOX pushed hard every year, blowing it well out of proportion because 24-hour cable news must keep you terrified of something or you might turn away.

<TEXT> I had a mini-stroke. Does that count?

I had a headache that morning, and I rarely get headaches. I was typing an email and was getting frustrated that I kept mistyping the same words, over and over, no matter how carefully I typed. A coworker was putting herself down to another coworker near my desk, as she often did, and I blew up at her for doing it and left the office. (I do not lose my temper or my cool, ever. I'm known and mocked for it.)

I was walking around outside, realized I was getting really dizzy and called my wife, who called a friend in my company to come out, find me, and drive me to the hospital. 

Now at that point I still felt headachy and dizzy, but otherwise OK. When the nurse asked me my social security number I answered, and she stared at me and asked it again. I told her again. She told me, calmly, that I wasn't making any sense. I tried again. She called for people to get me into emergency. No idea what I was saying, but in my head it was right. 

The headache got a *lot* worse, blinding. A doc came in, examined me, and said I was on drugs. My brother-in-law physically stopped him from walking away and forced to keep checking. They finally found blockage in my carotid artery that was enough to be very dangerous but not enough to require immediate surgery. I was on cholesterol drugs for a few years after that and aspirin every since, and I modified my diet. No lasting damage from the mini-stroke, it was a warning shot. I was very lucky. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Banning does reduce the rate, since it becomes more difficult to get, but it drastically raises the rate of dangerous abortions. One way to answer is to ask why so many of the same people fighting against abortion also fight against comprehensive sex ed and birth control, which are the two things proven to actually reduce abortions safely. 

Some people believe abortion is murder, and allowing any means condoning those murders. Some people do not like other people having sex and want them to suffer the penalties of it. Some people do not like women having control over their bodies. Some people just want control. </TEXT>

- Possibly the easiest way to donate is to go to [smile.amazon.com](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/about/ref=smi_aas_redirect?ie=UTF8 *Version*=1 *entries*=0) and set up your preferred charity, and from then on when you go to Amazon use that link so a portion of your sale goes to the charity.

- Facebook now [has a way to report fake news](https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/heres-how-to-report-fake-news-on-facebook?utm_term=.apOdL1roPA#.flOvQwzPp2). Do that every time people send you easily-disproven propaganda. 

- Support newspapers and media who are actively working to report legitimate, investigative news. This administration will almost certainly be just as hostile towards the media as it was during his campaign, and Mr. Trump has already shown signs of wanting to control the narrative and stomp on critical news. Pay for subscriptions. 

- Get involved in local politics. The vast majority of people in office now started out in public service -- with the notable exception of the president-elect -- and it's a way to make a huge difference, especially in city/county councils and school boards.

-  Stand up against local hate. Don't let anyone harass someone in your presence. Keep yourself safe, but don't be a silent witness. If nothing else, Facebook Live it. 

- Call your local politicians and let them know exactly how you feel about the president-elect, his nominated cabinet members and his stated plans. Be polite and respectful when you do. [Here's how to find them](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials).  

- If you're using the ACA, take advantage of your healthcare while you can. Get checkups, get birth control, get screenings, get an IUD. If you're a pregnant woman, ask for a breast pump. It'll take some time for the GOP to dismantle the ACA but it's in their sights.

- If you are gay and married, your marriage cannot be removed even if the laws change. But religious freedom laws will almost certainly come along, of the sort that Mike Pence tried to push through in Indiana before national pushback finally forced him to back down, and they will make it easier for people who object to homosexuality to deny you service. This sounds silly when we're talking about wedding cakes and venues, but it becomes scary when you see that the same language allows denial of service from county clerks, pharmacies, hospitals... You may wish to get powers of attorney for each other, get living wills, get all the documents that you didn't think you'd need anymore.

- If you're gay and not married but planned to, might want to step that up.

- If you are trans and you have transitioned or are in the middle of it, get your documents updated immediately. 

- Make sure you have all the documents you need to register to vote. Voter ID laws are about to explode and you'll need to make sure your voice is heard. Get your Social Security card, get your birth certificate, make sure you are registered correctly in your county and check now to make sure your record wasn't "accidentally" purged.

- Stay alert and informed, but do what you need to do to relax sometimes. You won't help anyone if you're freaked out all the time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gauzy or fringy scarves help a lot when transitioning a model from clothed to not. They give the model a way to stay covered and get used to revealing what she wants as she becomes comfortable, plus they're fun to play with and the semi-opaque nature softens imperfections while hinting at nudity.

Shoot from the back with the curve of a breast showing.

No one sags when they're lying facedown, head raised.

<TEXT> Hey guys? Please look up the etymology of the word "gender." It has never officially meant biological sex, although many people these days (and, apparently, everyone commenting here) use it interchangeably. Traditionally it has referred to masculine or feminine attributes. The American Heritage Dictionary explanation of the terms:

**The effectiveness of the medication appears to depend on the sex (not gender) of the patient.
In peasant societies, gender (not sex) roles are likely to be more clearly defined.**

"Gender" refers to the range of characteristics, social constructs and, yes, DNA, pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. 

You still may think there are only two gender roles and that they must align with the biological sex of a person, but it is a valid question. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At an Art in Odd Places exhibition in Orlando this weekend, one artist was asking strangers visiting her table to pair off and make eye contact with each other for a full, timed minute. If no one was available to match up with, she'd do it herself.

It was decidedly weird. I'm not a big eye contact person anyway -- my hearing isn't great and I tend to watch lips -- and the only person I'd held contact with for more than a few seconds at a time for many years was my wife and my kids.

But I stared into the eyes of a total stranger, a woman named Pamela whose friends walked up to the table with her and then bailed on her, for what seemed like a very long time. I could hear my wife and her newly-assigned stranger giggling a lot, but Pamela and I just looked and smiled. Very clear, light brown eyes, almost golden.

After, the artist handed us a plastic camera that spits out cheesy looking photos, and asked us to take pictures of each other and then write something about the other person on them. We could keep the pics, or hang them up by her table. Most people hung them, and took phone pics of the display for themselves. There were a lot of people hanging up there, and all of them were smiling.

Not a life-changing experience, but definitely one that changed our moods and left us smiling for a little while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A German scientist decided to see if some colors were warmer or cooler than other colors, so he put a prism in sunlight to create a rainbow and put thermometers in each color to see what happened. He also wanted to measure the temperature of "normal" sunlight to compare them, and he set thermometers outside the rainbow for that. 

He found that all of the colors by themselves were warmer than just sunlight, starting from violet and getting warmer as you get closer to red. But the thermometer he set next to red, where there were no colors he could see, was the hottest. 

That's how he discovered infrared, by accident. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep. The big spectacle moments should amplify whatever's been happening all along. They should plunge you into despair or excitement and elation because they're happening to someone you've come to care about. 

Abrams tends to coast on that, especially in movies where he thinks audiences will come in the theater already caring about the characters before the movie even starts. Doesn't work that way.

<TEXT> Abrams excels at fan-pleasing, hell-yeah scenes. You can tell, watching, that these are the scenes that were in his mind when he started writing.

He falls short at everything in between them that would give them meaning or weight, though. There's just whatever contrived sequence of events necessary to get the characters from one cool scene to another.

Deep meaning? Nope. Laws of physics? If they get in the way of a cool scene, dump 'em, no one cares that if you can see planets that big in the sky, their destruction would also take out the planet you're standing on. But that gives what happens a video game cutscene feel: shallow, shiny, doesn't really mean anything. (Except that these days video games often have more emotional depth than Abrams movies.)

I enjoy his stuff. I liked the first Star Trek movie and liked some of the third. I enjoyed the cotton-candy fansquee movie that was "The Force Awakens." But there's no point trying to analyze them, or look for anything deeper in them than "that looked cool." </TEXT>

<TEXT> For some of them, it's because they had already begun celebrating the idea of a woman president and the actual outcome seemed unthinkable. Dropping from elation to despair in a few hours leaves its mark.

For some, it's because they saw great strides in the acceptance of (or, rather the prohibition of discrimination against) multiple genders and sexual attractions, to the point where more people were comfortable coming out and living freely and planning their futures, and now they see that door potentially being slammed shut again.

For some, it's because they belong to a gender or a nationality or a religion that has been dismissed or openly threatened by our new president, and threatened by the rhetoric (and, already, the actions) of many of his followers. 

For some, it's because the removal of Obamacare, which our new president has promised, means death for themselves or a loved one.

For some, it's because a government which has already been fighting hard to pass every anti-abortion law they could possibly think of has just had its opposition removed.

For some, it's because they were already fighting uphill to get disproportionate numbers of black deaths by law enforcement addressed and they know now that not only will things likely get worse but they'll be blamed for it.

For some, it's because movement on climate change was agonizingly slow already and now even that is over, and our future may be sealed.

For some, it's because our new president's thoughts on NATO countries and his appreciation of Putin suggests he will not move to protect the Baltic states and Russia will sweep down into Europe.

For some, it's the hard realization how many people in the country hate and resent them, and no longer feel compelled to hide or disguise that fact.

For some, it's the despair that we are now and forever the country that elected Donald Trump president. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump thinks climate change is a hoax and reportedly plans to load his cabinet with people who agree. He said he has heard terrible things about the US National Institutes of Health. He wanted to eliminate the Department of Education and will almost certainly reduce it. He wants the EPA gone, or at least drastically reduced. He wants tech companies to provide ways for the government to break their encryption. His VP, Mike Pence, is a young-earth creationist who wants creationism taught in schools and has criticized President Obama for supporting embryonic stem-cell research. 

To be fair, Trump has not released many specific plans, but based on his previous statements and the stated opinions of people being considered for his cabinet, plus the hostile environment for non-white Americans we're already seeing and stricter immigrations laws sure to come, I am fully expecting to see fewer people pursuing scientific fields and many scientists uninterested in working for the government or a corporation leaving or avoiding the country.

I would love to be proven wrong.

Includes:

* THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated;

* FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.

* SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward

* SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure

Trump is said to be favoring his friend [Harold Hamm](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trumps-energy-whisperer-225877) for the Energy department. Both want to increase domestic oil production to reduce dependence on foreign oil.

Trump promised to junk the EPA back in March but [backed off that promise in September](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-backs-off-plan-to-eliminate-epa/article/2602581), saying he was going to reduce and refocus it instead, and "repeal major EPA environmental regulations such as the Clean Power Plan, the Waters of the United States rule and Obama's Climate Action Plan, which directed several Cabinet-level departments to start working on regulations to limit carbon pollution." Also said he wants to open up drilling on federal land.

Trump has said before he believes climate change to be a hoax, and is said by several news sources to be looking at noted climate-change mocker Myron Ebell as his EPA head. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, that I would recognize. I've done NaNoWriMo for over a decade, won some, didn't win some. I don't need the event for motivation. 

I'm not blaming the election specifically, the same thing would happen if, say, there was a major scientific breakthrough or a war broke out or something else equally significant. It's hard to explain without describing the plot in detail, but real-world events may now be moving much faster -- or at least in a different direction -- than I had plotted for and my choices now are to either junk the last third of the book, or write it in an alternate universe where this didn't happen, and that would take a lot of the impact away, I think. Like if you were halfway through writing a book about people fighting to cure cancer in 2025 and then CNN tells you a cure was discovered Thursday.

I have no idea how to write it now. I figured on a slower slide toward future ruin, and even if this presidency doesn't lead to that -- I'm trying to stay optimistic, who knows, it might work -- it's such a huge game-changer it won't fit in my story but will be conspicuously absent if I don't.

<TEXT> OP said "White people are the only ones not allowed to be proud of the colour of their skin." I offered a reason why. Challenging what I said doesn't change what I said. Bringing in other examples doesn't change what I said. 

Over the past couple hundred years, various groups of people in the US used "white people" to mean, specifically, "better-than-black." (Also in Europe and in South Africa and other places where such a distinction seemed necessary to them.) This is provably true. Doesn't mean all or even most white people did the same, just that enough of them did so and did so loudly while they were stringing up black people or fighting to keep them out of the voting booth and out of white schools and out of white neighborhoods and away from white spouses. Doesn't mean that white people haven't done anything good, or that bad things have never happened to white people. 

Because of that, when someone brags now about their white heritage or talks about the white race -- as opposed to their regional or national or religious heritage -- whatever that person might have meant by it, what many people hear is "I'm racist and proud of it." 

That may not be fair, but that's how it is at the moment. If you form a group to clean up neighborhood trash and bring meals to poor people and you call yourselves the Klu Klux Klan, it doesn't matter what your intentions are. If you fly your swastika because you treasure its historic Indian symbolism of peace and continuity, you're going to get glares. Just how it is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sigh.

I am not condemning all white people. I have not condemned all white people. I recognize the things people here have been eager to tell me about the history and abolition of slavery in Europe and the US. I am responding to the OP statement that white people are not allowed to be proud of their skin.

My answer, which none of the responses have paid much attention to, is that in the last couple of hundred years, when I read about people who are proud to be white, it has nearly always meant "proud not to be black." White pride. White power. White supremacy. The purity of the white race. Nothing anyone has said to me here has changed that. 

Africans were not proud to be black before they were enslaved. They never had to be. They were who they were, and they identified as whatever family or region or religion they were from. It was only after they were pushed into that position that they started wearing the description as a mark of pride and began using it to build a new culture. 

You can,. of course, be just as proud of being white as you want. Many people are. But I'm going to question why you feel the need to be. </TEXT>

My point, way back when, was that during those time periods some people defined themselves in opposition to a group of people they considered subhuman, and that description was pushed hard by more people through the years who were determined to keep that distinction alive. None of the responses to my argument seem to acknowledge history or the context of those times, as if everything must be explained solely based on what's happened in the last five minutes and nothing before then matters.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not unlike a [review I wrote six years ago, for "The DaVinci Code."](http://subject7666.com/no-cure-for-the-common-code/)

INT. SIR TEABINGS STUDY, NIGHT. Langdon, Teabing, and Sophie are studying the unrolled painting of the Mona Lisa.

LANGDON: There appear to be numbers under the paint, each one corresponding to a different color. What could it mean? Is it a hidden code?

SOPHIE: It must be. Hidden codes have followed me all my life.

FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: INT. LIBRARY. A teenage Sophie is frantically grabbing at book after book, body-checking other patrons over railings and through windows in the process.

SOPHIE (voiceover): For years I had considered syphilis preferable to the written word, preferring to have everything read to me by passersby. It was only after I developed a physical addiction to crossword puzzles that I discovered my knack for deciphering, which was carefully coaxed into life by my psychopathic cryptology teacher.

FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: INT. CLASSROOM. Surrounded by other children  some chained to their desks with intricately worked locks, some nailed to the wall in a binary pattern  the young Sophie looks fearfully at her teacher, Professor Allright, who is grimly carving the Atbash Cypher into an underclassman.

ALLRIGHT (voiceover): Woe to the student who couldnt solve the deviously difficult puzzle that opened the bathroom, or navigate the hidden traps and spring-loaded dangers of recess. I knew that one of these children would someday have to defy unstoppable, all-powerful enemies to crack an ancient code and expose the secret at the core of western religion itself, and it was up to me to craft them into twitching, neurotic, anal-retentive cryptographers, especially young Sophie to whom I was oddly drawn. Even my beloved sister, who did her best to brighten my days, came second to my destiny.

FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SUNLIT PARK. Professor Allright is being dragged by the feet into a sunny glen by his sister, a laughing young woman named Giselle. We focus on her, ignoring Allright who will never be mentioned again. She stops suddenly, terrified, staring at something we wont learn about for at least six more flashbacks, and then runs away.

GISELLE (voiceover): I kept trying to draw my brother away from the enclosed scholastic life and constant child abuse allegations and into the bright sunlight of Paris to live and breathe and experience. This was difficult because of his fierce dedication and because we lived in Chicago. Yet I could never forget what I saw on that fateful day. I never forgot it. Never, not even for a little bit, it was just that bad. Really, really bad. I moved to Washington and got a job creating celebrity crossword puzzles.

FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: INT. TEABINGS STUDY. Teabing is snoring on the couch. Langdon is ripping apart another priceless painting with a claw hammer.

LANGDON: See? This dog doesnt belong with the others! Hes holding Go Fish cards, not poker cards! It all fits!

SOPHIE: So all this time those crossword puzzles were connected through a bizarre series of coincidences that make little sense and advance the plot not at all!

LANGDON: Were close, weve very close. All we need is one more attack by masked assailants and Ill have it!

SOPHIE: What?

LANGDON: Another Oscar. If I dont get one every few years, I break out.

TEABING (jerking awake): Sorry, I was suddenly remembering the Palazzo Ducale in Venice, residence of the Doge and decorated with frescoes and paintings (including Tintorettos Paradise, the worlds largest oil canvas) that conceal the hidden chambers where the Council of Ten met, the tribunal where three judges condemned the guilty and hanged them from the rafters, and the cramped leads cells under the roof from which Casanova famously escaped. Which is odd, because Ive never been there.

SOPHIE: Aha! I can see words when I hold this brass and cherry wood Flintstone Secret Decoder Device over Langdons body! Chicken Doses Viaduct. What could it be?

LANGDON: Heh, yeah, never mind that, I was filming Turner and Hooch and I was drunk and there was this tattoo place no, dont!

FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ALLEYWAY, NIGHT. Langdon is sitting in a police car on a movie set. A large dog is next to him, licking his face with a tongue the size of a porterhouse steak.

LANGDON: Nooooooo!

<TEXT> First we were English, and Saxons, and Swiss, and French, and Spanish, and more and more. Some of us fought to become Americans. You defined yourself by your nationality, or perhaps your faith. No one defined themselves by skin color. 

Then we began enslaving Africans and we called them black. We talked about how dangerous they were and how lazy and how violent and sexual and beastlike and stupid, and to differentiate ourselves from them we started calling ourselves white. 

Once slavery was ended, and we got through the long Reconstruction period where former slaveowners and disgruntled Confederates did their very best to continue painting blacks as animals that did not deserve freedom and certainly not jobs or land, some of us in the early 20th century banded together to promote the superiority of the white man by harassing and sometimes lynching black people. When we argued in Congress to keep black people away from the voting booth, or out of the white schools and white neighborhoods, or from marrying white people, to be white became a mark of pride and community. To be white meant you were not black, it meant you knew you were better. To want white power and white pride meant that you wanted to keep blacks (and Jews, and other marginalized peoples) in their place.

See, black people weren't blacks before. They had their own names for themselves and their own heritages and histories. We made them black by taking them away from their homes and forcing them to make a new community here. We made them black by calling them that and worse, and they took that name and others back to use themselves out of pride and a need to redefine themselves as strong and capable and equal.

So, no. I am very proud of being an American, and to a lesser degree I'm proud of my English roots, but I will not go around saying I am proud of being white because the only reason it ever became a thing in the first place was to help keep down the people who were not. </TEXT>

[Here's the pics.](http://imgur.com/gallery/W8OXt) 

I use it most often when I'll be walking a lot or moving through crowds. I can fit my camera with lens attached, and two or three other lenses as needed in the main, padded pocket. I [use this insert](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001120WQ8/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8 psc=1), with a folded t-shirt underneath it for more padding. I can usually slip a speedlite between the insert and the side of the bag.

In front of that is a second zippered compartment, which takes my lighting stuff (diffusers, etc) and a folding bracket I use to get my flash off the body. A snap pocket is in front, keeps my business cards, gray card, charging cables, remote trigger, whatever's small and easily lost.

There's another zippered compartment behind the main one. I don't put anything bulky there, it gets uncomfortable to carry, but my iPad fits nicely. The rear document pocket (Velcroed) is for any papers I need, and for a folded plastic rain cover. The flap pocket is where I put extra camera batteries, cleaning supplies, AA batteries, whatever I need to grab quickly.

That's the most loaded I keep it. Most often I have a much smaller selection of stuff in it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not Reddit. I am me. Here's what I believe.

Policies based on supply-side economics do not work. Policies based solely on demand-side economics don't work either. A mix is required to deal with the back and forth of the market without breaking things. Since the 1980s the GOP's emphasis has been on supply-side policies, and we've seen, we've very visibly seen the effects.  I'm not saying the rich hole up in their mansions and dive into their money, but you can't deny that since then there has been a sharp upward curve in the income of the upper percentages versus the middle and lower classes. State governments that push hard for supply-side policies and tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy see their budgets tank. Enough of the rich take their profits and invest in things that benefit them personally instead of the intended goal of using it to create more jobs or pay their workers enough to reinforce the middle class.

Instead of picking at my word choices, perhaps you could point to some states whose supply-side policies have worked? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So perhaps you should have mentioned the law in your original question? You asked why other races aren't allowed to say it, and I responded. You didn't ask why the UK made it illegal.

But again, I'm going to stress that when someone in a group uses a term commonly used against the group, it's understood that they mean no harm by it, an assumption that cannot be made about someone outside the group saying it. 

That said, I think the law as you've posted it is there for a couple reasons. One, to allow officers to add charges onto someone committing a hate crime. Two, to inform British society that calling someone a historic slur is wrong for the reasons I've discussed above. That said, First Amendment considerations would probably prevent such a law from going into effect in the US. The UK has always been tougher on what can be written or said in public.

I'd also like to point out a problem in your OP.

"We all know that it's derived from a racial slur in which black people originally didn't like."

More accurately, "We all know that it's derived from a racial slur that white people used against black people during a period when many white people considered black people less than human and treated them accordingly, and that many racists continue to use the same way today."

"Didn't like" makes it sound like they were annoyed by a neighbor letting his trash cans roll into their yards.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People in a marginalized group often take the slurs used against them and repurpose them as terms of pride and self-identification, to take back their personal identities and define themselves rather than let themselves be defined by others. Women can call themselves bitches, blacks use the n-word, homosexuals have taken the many terms against them and use them now with pride.

Here's the difference: *you're not in that group*. When someone in the group says it, everyone else knows they mean it ironically or as a way to self-identify as part of the group and further their bond in that society. When someone outside the group says it, it is impossible to tell without context if they are friendly or hostile to people in that group, and since the group is already accustomed to being marginalized they're probably going to assume the outsider is hostile.

To put it in a more immediate way, say you have a brother who was a little slow in school and heartless kids called him a moron. You cared for him, and protected him, and worked with him, and one day when he said he didn't understand something in his homework you said, joking,  "Well, of course not, you're a moron," and he cracked up because it was so unexpected but he knew you were saying it to make him laugh and shake him out of his mood because there was no question in his mind that you didn't really mean it. And then it became a thing where you called each other morons and laughed together and it was you two recapturing the word and making it yours. But if a stranger saw him in a store and called him a moron, that person would still be wrong and hateful.

Same word. But context always, *always* matters. </TEXT>

It's really not that difficult. If you own a company that makes boats, giving the owner tax cuts to reinvest in his company will give him  a prettier building and no more customers. Tax cuts that benefit the middle class means more people with money to spend on boats, and the owner benefits from the increased profit.

If you're going to reduce taxes, give the money to the people who will spend it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Field and McKee books will give you formats and basic tips.

Read "Save the Cat" to get some basics and form, but please don't follow it slavishly. All it teaches you how to write are cookie-cutter scripts with the same story arc, over and over and over. (Although, granted, a lot of those sell so there may be something there if that's the sort of movie you want to write.)

I'm an avid follower of "Scriptnotes," the podcast by John August and Craig Mazin, and as mentioned here already they have an [archive of their FAQ answers](http://screenwriting.io/). They're good at telling you which rules are vital and which ones (like "no camera angles/movements") can often be ignored.

Maybe not a beginner's book, but a useful one: "Screenwriting 101" by Film Crit Hulk. Teaches a lot about motivation and making audiences care.

But the best thing? Read a lot of scripts. Read scripts to movies and shows you know very well to see how they were translated to screen. Read multiple versions of scripts when you can get them to see what changed and try to figure out why. Nothing helps like seeing how working writers are already doing it. Here's [a list of downloadable Oscar-nominated scripts for 2016] (http://www.simplyscripts.com/oscar89.html) and there are plenty more there and elsewhere online. Look for versions that don't say "production" in the filename. You want to read early drafts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My house is way too crammed with crap for me to make a case against material goods :)  But we've been making an effort the last few years to make everything as digital as possible and to get rid of stuff we don't actively like. 

I'd upgrade the computer, absolutely, and our ebook/music/movie library would go nuts, but no one would see that. I suspect gradually our cars and clothes and vacations would improve, but nothing drastic. We like things and we like enjoying ourselves, but neither of us likes to stand out, if that makes sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have no doubt I'd have an excellent computer, a much larger ebook, movie and music library, and other things we could accumulate that wouldn't look surprising. There are absolutely positives to wealth, not the least of which is knowing that a sudden medical emergency won't leave me homeless.

I think should this happen and I managed to keep it secret, we'd eventually pick out a slightly nicer house, with a little larger yard. But we're pretty private people now, I don't think our lives would change dramatically. I might be fooling myself, for all I know. I've certainly done it before.

But I'm middle-aged and not that far from early retirement, or a buy-out. My kids are grown and out, my house is paid for, I have no major debt. I already buy myself things I like without too much problem. Shiny cars don't interest me much.

(That said, I could see better photography equipment tempting me, and that escalates quickly. But my dislike of suddenly having people calling me constantly, coming up with lawsuits, openly begging me for money... if you called it a phobia you wouldn't be far off.  </TEXT>

I'd rather keep going as I am, with only my Amazon account knowing if I'm spending more than usual. My vacations might perk up but my wife and I are not big spenders. I can go to early retirement, or take a buyout if my job offers one down the line, and enjoy the rest of my life. </TEXT>

I'd just have a comfortable retirement, quietly help out family, friends and charities, and leave the rest to my kids.

I don't play every week anyway, just a ticket every now and then if the Powerball goes really high, so this is very likely not a problem I'd ever have.

I've read all the rest, in order as they came out, and in America in the 80s and early 90s that meant ordering from overseas bookstores or from in-country places that did a lot of international business.

<TEXT> I just finished the Superman one, by Tom Haven (I read the Marvel book last year), and I really love books like this. It's fascinating to me how many creative decisions I enjoyed/hated/wondered about as a kid were due more to finances, lawsuits and editor whim than they were to servicing the story.

There are reasons Superman went from cocky fighter for the underdog to barrel-chested symbol of law and order, why he became a dick for a decade, why his powers waxed and waned, and all of them are due to market forces and the interests of the editor at the time.

Do you like hearing the behind-the-scenes stuff? Does it make it better for you, or is it too much like "never meet your heroes" territory? </TEXT>

Statistically, it has to happen sometimes. Billions of people in the world, certainly someone who wasn't getting noticed by the object of their desire suddenly got noticed. But I'll bet it was due more to a change in circumstance than, say, the guy learning how to dance to impress her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have to actually stretch the garment. Hold the collar, hold the bottom, pull. Move a few inches over. Repeat. Over and over.

Won't help around armpits and not much from collar to sleeves, and as I said I have no idea if it can do enough to make it wearable for you. 

If there's a design on the shirt you really like, you might consider cutting that out and using it as a patch somewhere else, or framing it as a wall decoration. If it's the shirt itself you want, well, good luck :) </TEXT>

That said, if it's made mostly of non-natural fibers that won't work. You may stretch it unequally and get odd shapes. It will likely shrink back over time and you'll have to keep doing it. 

This works better for, say, cotton or wool sweaters or cotton t-shirts and polo shirts that used to fit but have shrunk. I haven't tried taking something that was too small for me and stretching it to fit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you want to push past this because you want to, or because you think you need to?

If you think you need to, don't. Good stories don't need to be explicit. Intimate stories don't even need to be explicit. You can work at writing good scenes that don't get into detail and as long as the emotional impact is there, off-color words aren't needed.

If you want to, well. Two methods come to mind. First, find some scenes from other writers you like and try retyping them. Can you? Can you type them if you replace some of the terms with milder versions as you go? That might help you pinpoint what the problem is. You just may need repetition, as you suggested. Does it make a difference if you retype a scene that doesn't reflect your particular interests? Some writers have a problem writing sex scenes for fear that readers will read too much into them about the author's own practices (especially for those authors who tend to write the same scenes over and over). If that's you, you'll have to either get past that or write enough of a variety of scenes to make it impossible to tell what you yourself might like.

Second, try writing as steamy a scene as you can. The first time it won't be. Go back and go over it and add more details. You can take breaks and work up to it if you like.  Keep rewriting the scene with more specifics, layering them on until the result is what you want.

You may never be comfortable writing a sex scene. No worries. Everyone is different. If you've tried and tried and it's not your thing than it's not your thing.  </TEXT>

There will be more WikiLeaks. Wouldn't surprise me if they're saving one big leak for the final weeks, possibly even one big lie to capitalize on the minor-but-accurate ones they've been dribbling out.

Also some authors seem to think that humans will have moved past the need for animal companions (or religions, or different musical tastes, etc). The fact that we're not essentially dissimilar to humans 2,000 years ago doesn't seem to dissuade them from thinking we'll all be homogeneous and evolved or something. </TEXT>

"Jumper" and "Reflex" are about Davy and Millie.

"Griffin's Story" is sort of a tie-in to the movie. I liked it better than the movie, but I don't really think of it as part of the series.

"Impulse" and "Exo" follow their daughter. The books start off with kind of a young-adulty vibe, with lower stakes and local consequences, but they ramp up quickly.

There's also a short story between the two sets of books that [you can read here](http://www.tor.com/2008/08/26/shade/).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gah...

I really may have to mute this and try my best to ignore it till after the first few episodes are out and I can read reviews.

Jumper is one of my favorite books, and Ive loved the series that Gould has written following it. The movie took the basic idea (coming-of-age novel about abused teenager who discovers he can teleport) and shoveled an unnecessary action movie on top of it. There were no secret cults of anti-teleporters out there, no Samuel L. Jackson, no kid teleporter. Gould just took the idea of if I can picture it, I can teleport there and let his character work out everything he could do with that. Turns out, a lot.

And the original story, where the kid starts taking on terrorists, is actually far more relevant to todays news than the slick, FX-heavy crap the movie ladled on.

The only good thing out of it, for me as a fan of the books, was that movie money probably helped Gould write more.

The recent books have followed Davys daughter, and I would in fact love to see a good adaptation done. But the movie was such a massive disappointment to me that I really dont want the same director touching it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aside from just working as a good story (see: your points above), my favorite fanfic does at least one of these, and preferably more:

1. Makes me remember why I love the original source. It captures the fun or the excitement or the drama the same way, with the same feel to it.
2. Helps explain something in the original source. The backstory of a character, or a scene that answers a question, I love those when they're well done. They actually strengthen my appreciation for the original, if that makes sense. My favorite fanfics could easily be canon. 
3. They write the characters *better* than the original source does. I prefer the Clark, Diana and Bruce of unpretty's DC universe much more than the way the actual DC has written those characters in the books for quite some time, and definitely more than the DC movies handle them.

I tend to read fanfic to get more of the original work. I do love some AU stuff but it has to work harder to get my attention. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just because you're adding the responsibilities of adulthood it doesn't mean you have to give up on your dreams.

I'm middle-aged. I have had jobs that were grinds but I did my best to make them fun or at least pleasurable for me and for any coworkers or customers I came in contact with, and I became competent enough at any position I held so I could largely ignore office politics. My wife and I are happier together now than we've ever been, and we're both still discovering new interests to explore together and separately. 

Work can be fun, and if it can't be fun it can be satisfying, and if it can't be satisfying it can be what pays the bills while you do what thrills you. Building a family can bring accomplishments that your childhood self could never have dreamed of. You can always travel. You can always write, and the older you get the more things you'll have to write about. I've always written, off and on, through my life, and I've recently discovered a love of photography, and I've started writing stories about the scenes I photograph. I never considered that, as a kid, but I'm loving it now.

You're realizing that the adult game of life is harder than the children's game of life. It happens. That just means it's more of a challenge, and the results can be more rewarding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because as groups grow and seek to define themselves by what they are and what they are not, insults for people who are not in the group gain traction quickly. Especially when those insults are used to immediately put any target into an easily-dismissed strawman category which instantly means any argument that person might have is instantly meaningless. And when those terms are sexually-based, fun to say or type, and cast the target as someone inferior by definition.

Me, I fully support the rise of the use of the word cuck (and SJW, libtard, beta male, sheeple, etc), as it saves me all kinds of time by pointing out which people are probably not going to engage in any sort of useful discussion. Not fond of insults against the GOP, either, although liberals don't seem as inventive for coming up with anti-GOP terms. Basically if you regularly use insults to describe your foes as if their inclusion in that group you made up is a foregone conclusion, there's little point in arguing with you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't argue with Trump supporters.

I have often argued with people who are planning to vote for Trump because they don't like Clinton for various reasons, or don't like the Democratic Party for various reasons, or because they support the Republican party and believe in its ideals and priorities, or because they are tired of the current government and want to see it shaken up. All of that I understand, and I can talk to and argue with people holding those opinions. We may not end up agreeing, but we can always find some common ground.

I haven't been able to argue with anyone actually eager to vote for Trump. I've talked and gotten a lot of bumper stickers and memes and sound bites back, but I wouldn't say there's a lot of interaction there. So I don't try. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That'd be me. I prefer fanfiction that could serve as extensions of the original source. Most of my drive to read fanfiction is that there isn't enough of the original, and I'm impatient (looking at you, "Sherlock").

I'm fine with slash if the characters are naturally leaning that way or it's believable in character, but I dislike romances that were forced just because the writer really wants it. 

That said, a good story is a good story and there are several AU works I really like. But mostly I want work that could be canon, or that explains glitches in the original and makes it stronger. </TEXT>

If I'm with a friend, there will be digressions. We could crawl out of a car accident, and we would be making jokes and discussing movies while waiting for the ambulance. But I doubt anyone would pay to hear us.

But TV and movies use shorthand for this to move us forward into the plot with just enough of it to make everything seem "real," and the balance here may have been off. I liked it, myself, although toward the final third the dialogue got a little stiff for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spend time with non-white people?

I'm sure there are guides and tips online somewhere, but the very best way to write believable, non-cardboard characters is to talk to (and, more importantly, listen to) other people besides the ones you're used to.

If that's too tricky or time-consuming, watch or read things created by people who don't look like you. But keep in mind that there will be jokes you won't get, influences you won't have, and comments that would be out of line for you to make. That's where a POC friend would come in handy, you see. </TEXT>

I was and still am an atheist, and frankly this isn't amazing knowledge passed from on high, it's common sense. But it was what I needed to see at that point in my life, and it's stayed with me ever since. Made a huge difference to my state of mind in the car. </TEXT>

You write the stories you want to see that seem cool and logical and right, and then the show/movie/book series you're writing for suddenly takes a turn into a direction you didn't see or has a flashback that flatly contradicts something you wrote. How do you react? Do you stick with your now-AU universe and move forward? Do you use elements of the new direction and strike a balance? Or do you abandon your direction and follow established canon?

Does it make a difference if you think the new official direction is good or not?

This week I found [Unpretty's work](http://archiveofourown.org/users/Unpretty/works) and loved it, and now I want more.

Who's your favorite funny fanfic writer? 

Edited to add: Thanks everyone for the great suggestions so far. As I say below they don't have to be fandoms I favor, funny is funny and good writing is good writing whether I've seen the source material or not. But if it helps, the stuff I'm most familiar with is: Firefly, Doctor Who, Star Trek, Buffy, Angel, Dollhouse, Sherlock, Marvel Comics, DC Comics, and Pixar. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, it's been awhile, but I'm *still* annoyed that Amazon bought the company that made my favorite ebook reader so they could let it die. One update, to make it more compatible with later iOS updates, and that's it since 2009. But none of the other readers had the same robust mix of features that were important to me. 

Last month I finally made the switch to Marvin 3, mostly because Stanza had started throwing up the occasional error or locked screen and I didn't want to be caught short. Reading ebooks is the single most common thing I use my iPhone for, with navigation, messaging and social media fighting for a distant second. (Actual phone calls are way down the list.) Marvin 3 is fine and does a few things better than Stanza, but I still miss it.

<DATE> 2016-07-29 16:07:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi folks! I'm writing a short story about a musician in a local rock and roll cover band (70s, 80s, 90s). A musician once told me that in his last band they always started out with a specific song because he also had to handle the soundboard at the side of the stage and enough of that song could be played without using his left hand to let him adjust levels at the same time. I'd love to include that kind of detail but I don't remember what song he mentioned. Any ideas?

(Editing to clarify: the band was a moderate success but has sunk back down to playing dive bars. Running the board like that is not intended to be practical or effective, just another way to show how far down they've come.)

Any help is appreciated. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Local video store had this and I checked it out a few times, but they caved under Blockbuster pressure back when it was big. Called, I think, "Bodies in Motion," it was a series of video vignettes of naked people. One was a nude woman lying in a dark room with a light pulled over her, so it was like watching the sun rising and setting over a mountain range. One clip was a slow-mo (for the time) of a boxer punching a heavy bag where you could see just what that does to the body. One was two modern dancers performing a routine.

I'd love to see it again, but "Bodies in Motion" brings up way too many Google hits and I can't remember anything else about it to help refine the search. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [IIL] "Hamilton" (but still dislike hip-hop), [WEWIL]? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-01 14:15:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know the [IIL] Hamilton question has popped up here many times already and I've listened to a lot of the suggestions, including Lin-Manuel Miranda's Spotify list of songs that inspired him.

Didn't help.

I love the dazzling word-play of "Hamilton" and the energy and underdog arrogance of rap translated into the story of the American Revolution. but I'm still not hearing any other hip-hop or rap I like. The subject rarely speaks to me (middle-aged white dude) and the pounding club beats turn me off almost immediately. Also, "Hamilton" has a strong sense of humor running throughout, and that's important to me.

(Which may also suggest why I like Weird Al's parodies of rap songs more than I like the originals. I also appreciate some of MC Frontalot's work.)

What I like are the rapid-fire lyrics that express complex subjects in inventive ways while avoiding nonsense phrases just to force a rhyme, but I may be coming at "Hamilton" from the Gilbert   Sullivan, Stephen Sondheim direction. I love the songs "Stone Cold Crazy" by Queen and "Walk This Way" by Aerosmith, for example. 

What else might I like, rap or otherwise?

<DATE> 2016-06-11 16:08:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My friend Dave wants to start cycling again, we both stopped years back once we moved into a house in the woods with a mile of soft, sugar-sand-filled dirt roads before the paving starts. But he's getting back into shape and misses his biking days, and he [found this one](http://www.sun.bike/product_detail.php?cl2=CRUISER cl3=SPIDER).

Questions:
So what is a moto-cruiser? Company-specific brand name? New style? Or is it just the old beach cruiser us old guys are used to, with fatter tires?

Instead of getting this one for $800 (which won't be happening) could he make something similar by putting big tires on a beach cruiser? Or are there features to this one we're not seeing? (Maybe a wider forkend to accommodate the tires?)

Are there other suggestions for a good soft-sand bike that runs around $300-400? A more expensive bike may be in his future, but he doesn't want to go big until he's sure he'll keep doing it.

Any help would be appreciated.

<TEXT> Why aren't there any new novels in the world of the BBC's Sherlock?

Would it be a licensing thing? I had thought Sherlock Holmes was in the public domain now, although I understand some of the classic elements that were added in later productions aren't yet. Would it be a control issue? They don't seem to have that problem with Doctor Who.

As long as writers don't make any lasting changes or reveal any past history that would conflict with the creators' plans, why not? I'd think it would be an obvious merchandising tie-in and some excellent works. Has anyone with the show ever said?

More to the point, I WANT TO READ NEW SHERLOCK STORIES. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a novel in my head. It's been there for nearly a decade now, in different forms, and I've tried writing it over and over. Here's my problem:

I know what the story is. I know what the underlying themes are, who the characters are, and how I want it to end. But since I've started I've changed the POV from 3rd to 1st back to 3rd, had breakthroughs that led to big changes in how the story progresses, and, most recently, realized that the whole first third of the book, taken out of context, could easily be seen as insensitive to some real world events.

So I have 7 or 8 rewritten versions of varying lengths, some different styles and a wide range of changes, and now I'm stalled in the water. I still love the story in my head but I'm having real problems finding the way forward. Any suggestions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back in the early 90s there was a 16,000 Movies videostore nearby that carried a lot of strange and obscure videos. One of them was called, I believe, "Bodies in Motion" and it was a series of short videos that all displayed human bodies. 

One was a nude woman lying on a floor in a pitch black room while a single light moved over her back and forth, creating amazing landscape effects, like time-lapse sunrises. 

One was a boxer, slamming his fists into a heavy bag in extreme slow motion (for the time) so you could see just what that does to the human body.

One was of a pair of naked dancers performing ballet. (I think. I also rented "Oh, Calcutta" around the same time and I may have those confused, but I'm pretty sure there was dance involved.)

There were more but I can't remember them. It was a cool video but Blockbuster bought the place out and I missed buying a copy when I might have had a chance. Decades later, you know what happens when you Google "Bodies in Motion"? Yeah, no luck. I'd love to know where I can get a copy.  </TEXT>
