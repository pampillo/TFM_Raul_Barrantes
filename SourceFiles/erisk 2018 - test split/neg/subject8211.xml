<TITLE> High FPS movies? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What does this sub think of movies, of any format shot in higher than 24 FPS?

I've been wondering when that will start catching on for a few years now, as technology steadily keeps improving and it never seems to. I mean, that format is like a century old now. Isn't it time to move on? I've seen my fair share of 60FPS videos and I've definitely grown to appreciate the value of a smoother picture. To the point, where even well-shot cinema looks choppy to me now. For example [this](https://vimeo.com/108018156) was posted over on r/videos a few hours ago and with the fast editing it just looks jarring to me. IMO, it would look so much better with a higher framerate...

What does this sub think?

Also, are there any movies (or short films, or even cool grad projects) shot in higher FPS that you can recommend? Except the hobbit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's true. They were built for greyhawk I believe.

Now, I know Red Hand of Doom isn't a 1-20 deal, but it does cover a fair range of levels and is one of the better adventures out there. What it does have, is a thread over on GitP, which details the work other people have done to adapt it to other settings - the Eberron adaptation being a particularly interesting one(though, this admittedly this is a rather uninformed opinion since I've not played Eberron to any significant degree).  
Also, sadly, the GitP forums are currently down, so the [link](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?171284-The-3-5-Red-Hand-Of-Doom-Handbook-for-DMs-Major-spoilers!-WIP-PEACH!) won't work, but I'll leave it here for reference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You might fudge a roll or two, but do not cheat on rolls chasing some bullshit idea of balance or fairness like "50% chance of success" - this completely invalidates the idea of character progression(which is where a fair number of people derive their enjoyment of D D from - seeing your character grow from a scrub to a hero). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hm... I was generally aware they buffed sneak attack(and that it could be used against undead), but now I went ahead and dug into the gears and cogs and it turns out, most types that were immune to sneak attack and critical hits in 3.5 are no longer immune in PF. In fact, type-wise, only oozes are still immune.

Also, elementals and giants are no longer their own type, but subtypes.

Undead are d8 instead of d12, but use Cha for HP and mid BAB instead of low. Mon. humanoids are d10 instead of d8 and 4 skill points instead of 2.

That's... all changes I highly approve of as a DM. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The elf bard would sit down, treat everyone to a mug of cheap ale and either sing or start recounting tall tales of his misadventures. Like that time he got trapped on a floating island full of amazons. Or that time he got crowned(briefly, but they don't need to know that).

The large noble warrior lady will take him up on the offer and rebuff all his advances, cuz her ladyship is a recent development. She might arm-wrestle him though. Which he will summarily lose.

The surly thri-kreen ninja will sit alone in a corner playing with his pet. He is shy, but deadly...

Until the half-lizard, half-lovecraftian-monster, half-a-bunch-of-other-things girl sees the cute little kitty and tries to befriend it(actually a rather vicious lesser basilisk, though when you look like her your notions of 'cute' tend to get somewhat skewed). They'll probably end up playing dragonchess.

The half-dragon drow priestess will stare at them from afar and scoff at such pointless pursuits like as merriment. When she eventually gets bored, she might start pulling petty pranks with her magic. Or sharpening her scythe. One of those. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was very easy for me - I got tired of **every** other DM's samey setting and decided to do em one better.

The core idea is a world where monsters are not sacks of HP for human PCs to massacre, but are actually full-fledged members of society. The majority in fact. Humans are relegated to a small nation on a tiny continent and frequently seen as slimy and opportunistic.

In fact, if look through this thread, you'll see that not a single response challenges that most basic premise of a human-dominated world. There's a reason I bolded that word.

Beyond that I aimed for a certain set of aesthetics that would create the ideal D D world as I see it. Such as the ability to have epic adventures(epic as in the *literal*, historical meaning of the word), the ability to let the players be powerful and do cool shit. The notion of a marked progression from lowly adventurer to mythical hero(which automatically excluded 5e as a system). The idea that magic is rare and special, while allowing the setting to remain high-magic and full of mystery and wonder. Another core concept in my continuing design of the setting is "the rabbit hole ALWAYS goes deeper"; or "there's always a bigger fish" if you will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TBH I think you are part of the problem. And people lacking in critical thought and western culture in general. I'm not sure if I should find it amusing or sad this notion of trying to pass infanticide or *genocide* as something less evil than rape. Have you actually stopped to think what genocide actually means. Go read some stories and look at some pictures of the german concentration camps and try the same spiel with a straight face.

And in case your approach merely relies on shock, as in "oh, look we think rape is worse than these other extremely horrific things",  
a) western culture strikes again  
b) it never works

Mind you, this is not a defense of rape, merely an argument for proper contextualization. </TEXT>

Just discovered this nifty(if it worked) tool. Except it doesn't properly.

1. There's a difference between where I drew the blob and where it got put on the globe.
2. Notice the tiny little artifacts on the globe projection?
3. To get any changes to appear I have to toggle the lag/long grid on the globe, just to get the render to update semi-properly.
4. Notice how the buttons with the drawing tools are missing.
5. When/if the rendering issue is fixed, can we please get a hotkey for switching between the views and for the drawing tools.
6. A non-zero axial tilt makes the mesh show through the texture on top.
7. Edit: Noticed the misalignment of the image I posted is due to the axial tilt.

This is on chrome 58(though same issues in firefox). </TEXT>

<TEXT> You do have a point. While Create food and Water is 3rd level, and a caster ratio of 1:15 (with casters of CL5+ no less) is mighty high for an army, Purify food and Water is L0. So is Prestidigitation. This makes it easy to salvage ruined stuff.

Though I don't think supply by fly would work as easily as you imagine. The *fly* spell simply won't cut it. *Overland flight* is 5th level and personal(meaning you'd require expending resources on carrying capacity, i.e. bags of holding or similar). Natural flight would work, but hey, if they have enough big flying beasts for that, the party has bigger problems. Ring gates are another failed idea(they have a weight limit).

So while magic works marvellously on small scales, army-scale magic is extremely expensive and/or high-level. To the point of, if the PCs face such an army, they're better off going looking for allies who can measure up, rather than trying to go up against that kind of might. </TEXT>

Fielding and supplying armies for extended periods is a logistical nightmare. Make it worse. In D D you can even go as far as enlisting the support of druids in making it harder for the army to live of the land.

You *should* have fly by now, so go behind the army's back and cut off supply lines. Hit em where it really stings. Evacuation is a waste of your abilities by this point.

<TEXT> Of course not. Populating everything from scratch is not feasible(my setting is quite young).

World gets 'rendered' in decreasing detail radially outward from my players. When preparing I decided the adventure would start somewhere on that large continent and placed the major powers there, then a couple dozen major cities/regions.
Those are developed in the "Why does it exist? Who rules it? What's it's thing?" formula. When my players decided they wanted to be pirates/have an aquatic adventure, is when I started going into more detail. For example I already knew the primary political and sociological tensions of the area they are starting in. I knew the coast was peppered with a loose collection of city-states, instead of a single unified nation. I knew the strength of the fleets of the neighbouring island nations and their economic interests, and the aspirations of the militaristic empire that's over the hills from said collection of city states. Then I started working on the "free cities" themselves.

The other continents are less developed for obvious reasons of me not being god, but enough that if the players should suddenly find themselves over yonder, I can sketch up something on short notice. </TEXT>

*Fine.*

My world is a super earth, orbiting a G0V main sequence yellow star with a perihelion of 140 mil km and aphelion of 150, 3rd among 5 planets, mean radius of 6,988 km, axial tilt of 20, gravity = 1.04g.

It has 2 moons, the size of the Moon and Ceres. Both are tidally locked.

Surface is 64% water, 35% land(this means ~50% more land area than earth).

It has 4 major land masses, the biggest of which is approx. 90x10^6 km^2.  
It has 2 large island chains(think oceania) and 2 ice caps, the southern being much larger.

The connected surface area of the underdark is equal to ~25% of above ground land area. Unconnected/isolated portions account for another 30%.

The highest mountain is about the height of Mars's Olympys. The largest one is about the twice the size of the Himalayas.

It is fully circumnavigateable by sea.

Subject to both plate and magical tectonics.

Geography, climate and demographics maybe another time... </TEXT>

There is very little incentive to have a fight on open ground if one side can gain advantage by choosing more favourable terrain.  
This means that very few battles, outside of large army confrontations are ever fought that way. And in D D not even those, cuz an open field battle is just an invitation to unleash all manner of area of effect magic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good god man... it's the manifester's familiar.

It starts off by giving neat bonuses and only gets better from there. It can scout for you. It can deliver messages. It can deliver touch powers. Then there's the tricks. It can share powers with you. For example sharing vigor. And share pain. And if you wanna get advanced, your crystal is half your HD. HD carry certain benefits. Not the least of which is a feat progression. How convenient then, that there exists the leech feat power. Though, you must first eliminate the construct immunities somehow.

As for the egoist, in combat situations he's all about buffing himself and others physically. You can blast easily too. And before yet another tables suffers the fate of "OMG, PSIONICS OP, BAN THEM!!11!", let me remind you of the cardinal rule of psionics(which, judging by this question, you most likely missed):

Being a good DM requires EFFORT. You can get away with less, but the game will suffer. Prospective DMs don't need to be coddled lest they give up, they don't need their precious feelings protected.

The only thing I agree with is that the article shouldn't be taken as an absolute truth. It does come off as a bit "one-true-way"-ist. There are other styles that work, but for the type of game he is looking to create(immersion-heavy), this is really all the correct advice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Think of a few actors and create conflicts. I find it's amazing how quickly details start to emerge once you have some kind of conflict in play.

Like maybe the church and the local merchant's guild. Say the guild bought a highly sought after property right from under the churches nose. Maybe they wanted to build a temple or it was sacred ground. Maybe now undead have been sighted around that area. And maybe the church refuses to help until they are given that land back. Cuz even holy people can be petty like that. But the merchant guild refuses to yield.

There you go... a couple actors, a conflict forcing both sides to interact and you've got a compelling story.

Another option is to come up with random unrelated details, then ask why and how those details came to be the way they are. </TEXT>

But that's the tone I was going, my vision of the world. I basically took everything that irritates me about the generic D D world and every world that I've seen by every other DM I've seen and went in the exact opposite direction.

**THE** Demogorgon.

It's a demon lord. It's *THE* demon lord. The prince of demons. Only Graz'zt could even give him a run for his money. I'd say L30. Minimum.  
Engaging him on a battlefield not of his choosing, without tons of backup and minions would be doing the Prince of Demons a terrible disservice.


Random note: The old dragon magazines published the Demonomicon of Iggwilv. The articles were pretty great. Demogorgon is in #357. He was CR33 there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **It is the only type of balance that IS important.**

The more unbalanced the party, the harder your job as a DM. So it isn't strictly critical, but it does make the DM's job exponentially more difficult for creating situations in which everyone is having fun. It is possible for that difficulty to *rise into the impossible*.

***
*However party balance isn't what anyone, including OP is talking about ITT.* You're all talking about world balance and that is much less of a problem. The DM can always adjust the world to suit a balanced party. It only becomes difficult when adjusting for one part of the party makes things worse for another. Hence the importance of inter-party balance. A party of fighters is one of the easiest parties to work with because, being the same, their capabilities are by definition balanced. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's kind of a pet peeve of mine how many worlds end up human dominant just because it's the lazy, automatic assumption or because the DM is uncomfortable with a more monstrous world. It's the reason why I had to create one of my own.

Super happy you're trying to change that. Good ideas too. Though I wouldn't go so far as to call elves "completely different creatures". One definition of a single species we have IRL is if the creatures can mate with each other.

One option is that people can think, and are able to pay heed, venerate or even worship the forest. Have you heard of genuis loci? Maybe the forests have some form of rudimentary intelligence.  
Besides, the chief cause of death among animals is predation or accidents, not death of old age. Circle of life kind of thing. Maybe your animals are long-lived too, but don't get the chance. I mean what do you think sustains the monstrous ecology of a D D world?

Maybe there are even ancient specimens that have attained sentience and hold the wisdom of the ages and act as protectors of the forest and its denizens.

Real world mythologies are of great help in WB - a) you already know they resonate with people(they've survived through the ages); b) there are a vast number of obscure and incredibly interesting ideas(especially as it relates to a western culture). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well... I'm in a similar situation.

Party ended up choosing the archipelago "caribbean" region to start in and going for the pirate theme. They want guns. I had considered guns, but it's one of only a couple of pieces of outstanding content I hadn't fleshed out the rules for... What are the chances(100%, I'm sure some of you would say).

In any case, there is a big difference between medieval weapons and modern firearms. Do not base your impressions of guns on the latter. Medieval guns were scarcely more than a large single-shot boomstick that barely did anything more than produce lots of smoke.

The reason firearms took over is because of ease of use. There's a saying - if you want to train a longbowman, start with his father. The ability of simple peasants to be marginally effective with a gun is what gave rise to firearms in the middle ages. A trained longbowman is substantially more lethal than a peasant with a gun. But peasants are a dime a dozen.

D D has magic. Against which medieval-technology guns are pitiful. </TEXT>

We were on our way to investigate some demonic activity. Got ambushed. By two big scary demons. The rest of the party was barely holding their weight against one of them(one PC got knocked down). I kept the other one busy. He was apparently very friendly. All he wanted to do was hug me. I got dragged down to hell. Thankfully we had a powerful artifact that granted a few lives. I got resurrected, a short while later we raided the sort-of-beachhead demons were trying to establish. Guess who was there? My old friend. Let out a beastly roar and charged. Luck smiled on me and I promptly mopped the floor with him. Like literally filleted him.  Single-handedly annihilating something that was capable of challenging the entire party alone was neato. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know how the quality of the villain often reflects the quality of the movie? It's the same in D D, the quality the player is reflected in his evil characters.

That's because playing a great villain draws so much from the skillset that makes one a great player/actor, that even small oversights or shortcomings are brought to light. A vanishingly small number of people possess that skill, both among actors and among D D players. Many, many more just like the idea of playing an evil character without the necessary expertise. Movies have casting directors... DMs rarely take on that role. Hence the proliferation of the murderhobo evil PC(not even cartoon villain, as *even they* still tend to follow some basic set of rules). </TEXT>

<TEXT> You may also increase survivability in general. In my game we use PF rules and max HP. Which means that actually killing players is very hard, so long as the squishies don't try to act as front-liners. At that point it's their fault anyway. For example, a 5th level barb with a respectable, but not great 16 con would have to take 91 damage to drop dead. At 5th level that's plenty of buffer. </TEXT>

What I did come up with, in case you actually want to see it, is: 1. A bunch of DCs for different alcohols. 2. Con check vs DC+amount of previous drinks(in last 24 hours) or suffer penalties. </TEXT>

B) It is not reasonable. Heck D D doesn't even have a concept for acceleration.

Do not look too deep. For the shapeshifting bit... well, speed is a defined property in D D momentum is not. Therefore speed is preserved, seeing as how that makes things more interesting.

See, this was an example of the proper reasoning. "What is more plausible/realistic/fitting" is faulty. "What is more fun and dramatic" is the correct attitude. </TEXT>

It was meant as an attempt to shake the lazy, knee-jerk simulationist attitude towards a game that is in no way simulationist. Trying to transpose these isolated chunks of real-world trivia onto the universe of D D is... sketchy at best. Silly and absurd at worst. For crying out loud, in the rules there exists no concept for even something as fundamental as acceleration.

Don't get me wrong, discussions like this to try to find out where the line in the sand is drawn are amusing, but someone has to point it out for the sake of the great mass of people who'd just go right ahead and build their sand castles out of wet sand otherwise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No need to apologize. I'm not into that PC bullshit.

But it is important knowing where the source of racism lies and to what it is applied.

An elf refusing to marry a human because of their short lifespan is, fundamentally a form of racism, justified under the circumstances. An elf shopkeep refusing service to a human for the very same reason is uncalled for bigotry(a briefer lifespan has no bearing on the ability to purchase goods). This is probably not a very good example, but I hope it conveys the point.

Using humor to deal with questionable subjects should be allowed, but that's about the only reasonable blanket statement one can make. Anything more requires context. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you kidding me? Precisely in all editions before 5th full casters have *always* reigned supreme.

I agree with the fact that this is reality altering magic that should be powerful. However the DM rightfully possesses discretionary powers with regard to certain wishes. You see, when players enter the game there is an implicit understanding that they want the game to happen. Wishing for "slay the BBEG" or "bring me the McGuffin" flies directly in the face of that. But that's the extreme cases.

I also agree with regard to twisting wording. Toying with your players should be reserved for players who like to be toyed with.

But that's not a problem with wish. It's a problem with the DM.

It's a problem with how the game is arranged, with the clash in expectations, with ingrained preconceptions of the game.

***
A bit unrelated, going back to your "swing from the chandelier and drop onto the goblins scenario". Can you guarantee next time you will make the same call? This is my personal problem with 5e - lack of consistency(among other things). It's why I stick to 3.P. This is not a condemnation of 5e, just a preference borne of my priorities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **All the answer here are wrong!** ^(Unless they agree with what I said below.)

The correct answer is: However hard you both agree he should.

Here's a handy chart in case you're having trouble deciding:



\# | Lethality | Expectation
-|---------|-----------
0 | None | Characters may be rendered unconscious or disabled, but won't ever actually die, and won't suffer permanent injury. I love my characters and never want anything bad to happen to them. A TPK will result in the characters being rescued in some fashion.
1 | Very Low | Characters who "die" can come back with a permanent penalty of some kind, but won't actually die. This does not include obviously suicidal actions (swimming in lava, etc.). I like my character, and want to play them for a long time, but I'm okay with them taking a few hits along the way. A TPK will result in something bad happening to the characters, such as
2 | Low | Enemies will not actively attempt to kill disabled characters, but may kill the character while attempting to disable them. Enemies will not coup de grace anyone already unconscious. I like my character, and I'd rather not die. TPKs may result in players bleeding out or naturally recovering; it will fall entirely to the rolls of the dice.
3 | Normal | Enemies will attempt to kill disabled characters when the opportunity arises, but will typically focus on important threats first. I like my character, but death is a part of the game. TPKs will have varying results depending on the nature of the enemies; players may be killed or captured.
4 | High | Enemies will target easy targets, and will make a concerted effort to kill as many players as possible. Death will be a serious concern. Character death is a thing; I won't let it ruin the game for me. TPKs will have varying results depending on the nature of the enemies; players may be killed or captured, but are more likely to be killed.
5 | Very High | Someone will probably die every session. Encounters will be above average difficulty for your level. Combat will be fast and brutal. Fuck my character, I'll roll a new one.

<TEXT> Me, I'd welcome this type of backseat gaming.

In fact I use a rule, where characters with certain knowledge skills can, once per session speak authoritatively on some subject. I.e. they can actually say something like "There's a dwarven village over that hill where a famous master armourer makes his home" and unless that contradicts the rules of the game or established canon, the arrangement is, that I have to accept that statement as truth.

This goes back to establishing that trust between each participant in the game, regardless of role. And of setting the correct expectations for a game, right from the get-go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Due to the unbelievable diversity of civilized creatures in my setting, racial or ethnic prejudice is very regionally specific, frequently on a historic or political basis. I also deliberately tend to avoid monoculture races(as is the norm in D D in general).  

Sexism... that's mostly non-existent. Real life humans are products of millennia of evolution and exhibit a fairly significant amount of sexual dimorphism.  
There is nothing in the magical land D D to back up that arrangement mechanically.  
Obviously there is some amount of sexism, but that's usually socio-cultural, or due to divine intervention. Take drow for example. Which means that a different culture would have different customs and traditions. Remember that bit about avoiding monocultre races?

Violence in itself is given no special treatment regardless of variety. The details depend on the comfort level of the players of course. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, yes. The quick resolution is something we can all agree on. In fact I'd lower the threshold to 1 minute.

My point is that, although it is the DMs prerogative to make the ultimate ruling, he shouldn't abuse the authority, since this is a group activity, a collaborative effort, not a solo performance. If a player brings up a certain inconsistency and the party all agrees, then the DM should only overturn this if he has a very good reason to do so. This is where trust comes in. In a party where trust is established, the players will accept a questionable ruling, because can trust the DM to have a good reason to do so. Where this trust is missing, is get where you get arguments.

And people don't realize how many of their decisions are subtly motivated by fear. Fear for the safety of their character, for the integrity of the game or their fun. Fear of confrontation. Of being screwed over. Of having their agency taken away. Fear of veering into territory you have no prepared material for. Fear of ruining the story you want to tell. Fear of being forced to improvise.

So what is agency? It is the ability to meaningfully affect the world around you. It requires the ability to make predictions about that world. If the rules change so often that you never know what the result of your actions will be, that impinges on your agency. And people will argue and rules-lawyer to hell and back if it allows them to preserve that. No so-called "rules-lawyer" argues for minutes on end just because they like being confrontational(well maybe some do, but that falls wholly outside the game by that point). They argue because it threatens their ability to have fun in the game.

This of course doesn't address the dickheads who use the game as a vehicle for other, mostly out of game purposes. That however is a whole 'nother can of worms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This attitude of deference and blind obedience to the DM needs to **die**.

You said so yourself, you have a person who has expertise at your table and one who doesn't. Do the real-life common sense thing and trust the one with the expertise.

Set up procedures to handle rules inconsistencies. Ask the DM how much he is willing to stick to the rules. Ask the player how much he is willing to tolerate the rules not being stuck to.

A reasonable arrangement IMO, is for the experienced player to, once, correct the DM whenever he makes a mistake, on the promise that the DM will accept that correction unless he has good reason not to. Of course that requires trust, and we all know how hard that is to acquire. People simply don't realize how many interactions between DM and players are governed by fear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the DMs point of view... most real-life humans are petty. They don't like getting blindsided.

This is not a defense of him, but it is a concise illustration of my point, from the player side.

Even I have, consciously and deliberately done this. Why? Because it works. In my case it worked. The DM caved. But only because he had been placed before a done deal. When it had already been too late.  
There was a campaign where the DM was being unreasonably restrictive with sticking to the rules. So when I was denied a small concession to realize the character I wanted, I went in whole hog, instead abusing the rules, to the letter, just so I can get my character to work. It is something I would never allow as a DM, but I was attached to that character and as a player had been backed into a corner.

This is precisely the sort of adversarial attitude and defensiveness I was referring to. It's unhealthy for the campaign as a whole. </TEXT>

**Touch AC:** Your AC without armor or other things you wear. I.e. the active component of AC, how much you can move out of the way.  
**Flat-footed AC:** Your AC when you can't react. I.e. the passive component. How many protective things you've got on you.

Also, conceptually, the game has a much wider range of values. I.e. the lowest bonuses are lower than in 5e and the highest bonuses are *much* higher. Ability scores are not capped. You can have 30 strength. Or even 100.

Oh, forgot this: There's the concept of "Ability damage", where certain effects reduce your ability scores temporarily(damage) or permanently(drain). And negative levels are a thing. You can have your levels drained(usually by undead). </TEXT>

It seems in every story the party just puts up with the DM, no matter how crazy things get. Even experienced players and DMs seem to just bend over.

Very rarely the party bands together against the DM, but I've never really seen any stories where they actually organized and tried to get the game back on track, salvage it or just collectively refuse to submit to the authority of the DM.

Have any of you played or been witness to such a momentous event?

* Casters reign supreme.

* Numbers are much broader.  
The fact that numbers start lower and go higher means that at L1 you're a peasant, at L20 you are a god. Opposite to 5e where at L1 you're an adventurer, at L20 you're a slightly more heroic adventurer.

* Character building takes a lot of time.  
It's finicky. The range of the system means that not all character options are suitable for all games. For example the toughness feat is pointless in any game that moves past level 1-2.  
People tend to use the word "trap" options, which is somewhat of a misnomer.

* You can actually play monsters.  
You can play dragons(not dragonborn, actual dragons, the same ones you'd fight otherwise). You can play undead, vampires, liches, what have you. And everything in between.

* There are some rules dysfunctions.  
Your table better be prepared to actually apply common sense. </TEXT>

5e is indeed more streamlined. I wanna say it's like Heartstone vs MtG, but I don't know if that's true, since I've not played the former and barely the latter(mostly just watching friends). </TEXT>

<TEXT> #3

Two is good for specific concepts, sidequests and such, but is too few for it to be called a classic D D party.  
Four, the classic figure, while perfectly fine in a dungeon crawl, dilutes the spotlight a little bit too much for my comfort.  
Five+ is diablo and not D D.

Three, IMO is the perfect number. It allows for everyone to be involved practically all the time. It allows that characteristic party dynamic to emerge. It allows splitting the party(with two, splitting basically means solo mission). It allows politics and backstabbing(with 2, if there is interparty conflict the game falls apart). Each player's niche gets wider.  
Technically, it allows me to manage the game better and use single monsters effectively, since they're not overwhelmed by the action advantage. It lets me adjust encounters more broadly, since I have more wiggle room with regard to what the party can counter or is weak against. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Know your party is the first step.

It depends. Some parties blindly rush onwards regardless of odds, expecting the DM to adapt or plainly not caring(they're playing a game after all and merely expect the DM to keep his word by delivering that game). Others are more careful and actually engage with the world. For the first one, you as the DM need to warn them, since they don't pay attention to the world.

Out of the others, some need to be forewarned with anything from environmental clues to someone ingame straight up telling them "you can't handle this".

And if you're really lucky, you will have a disciplined, proficient party that you can throw shit at, that they will have the sense to react accordingly to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hm... might I suggest taking a more direct, interventionist approach in a couple of sessions.

Basically... show them how it's done. If you ask them "how do you persuade this person" and they get stumped, take over for them, suggest a method, even take over their character briefly.  
Normally I wouldn't recommend that for a whole slew of reasons(you shouldn't take away player agency, it's not your job to play their characters as well), which is why I suggested to only attempt it once or twice to see if they bite.  
But in your case I believe a little demonstration of what it actually looks like to act a role, to immerse yourself in a fantasy would be beneficial.

If they still don't bite... well, they seem to enjoy being led along the rails. You mentioned they play video games religiously, and most video games are linear experiences, where you are guided along, being subjected to the story, rather than driving it yourself. So offer them the on-rails set-piece action they seem to crave. But do it for yourself, in a way you enjoy.

If that doesn't work for you, well then, I guess it's time to look for a more active group. </TEXT>

But I do plan on running a more mature game sometime soon, where all of the macabre things don't actually fade to black. Including sexual stuff, which really doesn't deserve any special treatment in the presence of all the other ugliness. (Frankly I am baffled by why so many people make a distinction. Maybe because it's the most prevalent form of uncomfortable topic that crops up and has become the poster child for all truly grizzly subjects? Dunno...)

Thing is, with these topics, you just gotta make sure everyone's on board, before even starting the game, not just dropping it on players out of the blue mid-campaign. That's what session 0s are for: setting expectations/the tone. </TEXT>

Most other completely new spells I have are rather boring and just fill gaps in story or mechanics. For example *Flame Pop*, which is the missing fire-based cantrip.

Other than that, the one homebrewed spell that sees most use is permanency.  
Homebrew because we allow it on almost every spell. It acts as an intermediate step between items and duration spells. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many people in this thread seem to suffer from the fundamental attribution error, so I'd like to add a more balanced explanation:

Being a stickler for the rules is but a symptom of the underlying conflict of expectations.

Some of you may be okay with a more free-flowing structure, but I for example, and seemingly this player would be *miserable* in a world where I would be unable to make correct predictions about the outcome of events. We rely a great deal on the rules, to provide a frame of reference upon which we can correctly reason about the world and our character's interactions with it.

Furthermore he simply seems to expect a different style of play that what the rest of you are engaging in. Perhaps he wanted a serious game, where everyone can focus on the immersion of the world, rather than lollygagging around with their characters.

Also, when he says "THE worst gaming group" realize he's speaking strictly from his own subjective perspective. A better expression would probably have been "[...] this is THE most unfun *I've* had in a game [...]". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Me, I provide guidelines and welcome any such addition. Just as the story is a collaborative exercise, so too can worldbuilding be. More input certainly makes the world a more lively place than one single mind can ever dream up.

For example: This here is an archipelago nation of trader gnomes. They're known for this, this and that. Their culture is broadly such and such.
This over here is a nation of nomads, who roam the steppes, value freedom, honor, etc.

Everything fits somewhere. If it isn't in the guidelines/world overview, you just ask and we find a place to put it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> - Old D D has its roots in wargaming.  
It was about a very specific style of play - get your 10-foot pole and bag of sand and in the dungeon you go. It was a puzzle to solve. The whole "wide world", "character-driven" and narrative bits came later.
- It didn't focus on good vs evil, rather law vs chaos.

I'm not kidding.

I've got a specific world with specific values, magic and race distributions and I have a few major plot points/tensions.  
Then I put all the actors over here and have them run through the stage to their goals.  
The campaign opens up with a classic call to action based on the PCs backstories. I never do "chosen by the gods" however, unless the character is specifically focused on his divine devotion. More of a fan of the "chosen by fate/circumstance", since that allows more freedom.

That is the abstract method, the minutiae are another matter entirely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I understand your player, as I'm probably the same. She seems to approach her character builds as puzzles to solve. If you indulge her, then a thank you on behalf of all of us who enjoy that aspect of the game.

Since we're talking unofficial, I personally allow that feat to straight up reduce the effort it takes to wield a weapon, since it opens many new options, without unduly increasing the power of the feat(i.e. using 2H weapons of your size as 1H or 2H weapons of +1 size as 2H).

By itself however, RAW especially, the feat is not that noteworthy. It can however be both superceded or combined with Strongarm Bracers or the Powerful Build racial ability of Goliaths, if one really wants to go all-in on the big-ass weapon style.

And if you allow the expanded version, a character could potentially feasibly dual-wield 1H weapons(albeit with an additional -2 penalty for the offhand, due to the feat), like say, scimitars.

My personal assessment is that if a feat can be one-upped by a 6K item, then it is in dire need of some buffing(the norm for an average feat is 10K gold, as per A EG). </TEXT>

<TEXT> In older editions(read:3.5) creatures between you and your target provide (soft) cover for it.

In general there is no other specific limitation for fighting in small spaces. Freedom in the spaces you occupy is all that is required for effective combat.

And while we're on the subject, same deal with wings. If a character has wings, it's hardly concievable that a 5-ft space(for a medium creature) is enough for them to function effectively, but nothing in the rules prevents them from providing flight normally. </TEXT>

Second, your refererence to "OP character" makes me think you are a new DM. If you'll allow me one tip: As a DM you should strive to make damage the least of your worries. There are far worse ways in which the game may be broken, 3.5 especially, than a character's raw(not even applied) damage numbers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure where you're getting these other versions, but I've seen only one in the books. And it is quite restrictive(and could stand to be less so).

It also deals with sort of a "hidded statistic" of DnD - weapon *effort*. Instead of reducing the *effort* to wield a weapon by one step, it only specifically allows you to wield a weapon one size category larger than you with the same effort. The vagueness of the concept and it's overzealous specificity make it a trap choice in most cases, barring certain very focused builds. </TEXT>

I don't know about the "god ideas" thing. I think the assumption is, the audience can see past that and think for themselves.

1. Go to "*SC2Folder\Support64*" folder(or just *Support*) if you only have the 32 bit version of SC2.
2. Make a shortcut of *SC2Switcher_x64.exe* wherever you want your Mass Recall shortcut to be.
3. Go to the "*SC2Folder\Maps\Starcraft Mass Recall*" folder, hold shift and right-click on "*SCMR Campaign Launcher.SC2Map*". Select "Copy as path".
4. Go to your shortcut and go to Properties. At the end of the Target field add a space and paste what we copied.
4. [Optional] If you noticed, the mass recall map folder had another file in there, an **.ico** file. While still in the shortcut properties, click the "Change Icon" button and navigate to that **.ico** file.
5. ???
6. Profit. ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> His being that difficult removes some of the sympathy I have for him, but nevertheless, I do sympathize. It might even be a defense mechanism in the face of what he feels are overwhelming odds.

This is simply the kind of player he is. He has a favourite role he wants to play. I cannot emphasize enough that this is **no less a valid playstyle than any other**. 3.5 DMG2 offers some great insights on player types if you wanna dig deeper.

 I cant see how it would be "too much work" to create a new character in an evening while I am sacrificing months to create a fun world to explore.

This shows that you completely misunderstand where his enjoyment of the game comes from.
***
Engage him based on his backstory(though I would seriously ask him for a 2-page summary of the key points). If you're running a particularly lethal game you should have mentioned this before starting it. You both could compromise, by you having ways for him to keep playing his character if he dies(resurrections, deific patron, etc.).

If you are not willing to accommodate his playstyle, do notify him bluntly, let him play till he dies and send him off with a memorable scene when it does happen. At this point it just becomes a situation of 2 conflicting parties, neither of which are willing to compromise so it's best to part ways. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TBH, I'd not want to be in that game. Constraining things to reality in that manner means constraining bonuses on skills to about +6-8. In the game I actually want to go and be a hero, do physics defying stunts and get away with it, just because I'm that damn good.

Point is, equating reality to a game does the game a disservice 99.9% of the time. Consistency is a nobler goal the same amount of time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Come on... CR was never meant to be indicative of threat. It is just a rough metric that will help you gauge the power level of a monster.

A CR5 monster can TPK a L7 party, if it exploits their weaknesses, and similarly a L5 party can completely walk over a CR10 monster they were particularly strong against.

Besides, you have to realize that in the current "meta" of 3.5 CR means even less.

And not because of the example you mentioned mind you. An optimized barbarian can probably one-shot your young dragon.

No, the problem is the action economy. At higher levels the action economy advantage of a party against a SINGLE monster becomes so great, that anything that's not untouchable(and thus TPK material) gets completely obliterated.

Use more than single creatures. For BBEGs have setpiece battles. Changing terrain, reinforcements, time limits, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 5e is quite a bit more streamlined, and also features a limited range. It's hard to make ineffective characters there.

3.5 and Pathfinder, along with their idiosyncrasies, also bring a wealth of character options, including the ability to grow a character from a bumbling peasant to a herculean hero. Or be completely useless if you pick the trap choices. </TEXT>

The thing I personally like with 3.P is the consistency it can bring. There's enough material, that I as a DM can reasonably extrapolate any situation, even if not directly covered by any rule(which is rare enough as it is).  
That means that PCs, given enough system mastery can make concrete predictions on how the world will respond to their actions. None of that "what do I feel the DC here is" or "hm, this task should be hard enough

You wanna slit someone's throat? PF's Called Shots.  
You wanna make a Faustian deal? Fiendish Codex II.  
How do you handle possession by a demon? Book of Vile Darkness.  
Keep your undead straight? Libris Mortis.  
Rule a kingdom? PF's Ultimate Campaign.  
Wage naval warfare? Stormwrack.

That, and the amount of character options. Play anything from a bard dragon to intelligent undead to a mermaid barbarian. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for indulging me.

Eberron is really that steampunk world you're talking about. It's actually a pretty cool setting. Rokugan was the eastern spinoff(i.e. L5R). And I think Kingdoms of Kalamar came in 3.5 era.  
I think all the rest were from before(i.e. Dark Sun, Dragonlance, Greyhawk, Ravenloft, etc.).  
I guess Ghostwalk can sorta kinda count as a setting, even if it's just one book. It's basically just the city of Manifest and environs, along with changes to make dead people playable.

Out of all of those I probably like the Planescape setting best.

But you are correct, you can't just wipe 20 years of content. And only for AD D. Compared to that, I'd still count as a relative newbie I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well then, your experience has been vastly different than mine. Not sure what level of power you were playing, but in high-op games, where my time was spent, the monster vs player equation is pretty evenly split between attack/ability DC vs AC/saves. SR also plays a regular role in that interaction, just a bit less frequently.

Also, attack bonuses vastly outpace AC growth. A well built damage dealer will always hit.

Not to mention DR, energy resistance, concealment/miss chances, immunities, contingencies or my favourite: no save, just suck.

There are so bloody many attack and defense vectors you can take, it's almost impossible to break the system by going out of range.

What you're talking about is telling me that you and your DMs never really left that cozy core-only(or close enough) sandbox. </TEXT>

Now ask yourself, what do you think mortal magic can hope to achieve against deities?

If the DM so much as lets you touch him without going into high mythic/epics, he's doing something horribly, horribly wrong.

You need a reality check. If the Lord of the Damned freakin hells had to worry about even a single evil sorceror, he would have been taken down literally ages ago.  
It's equivalent to saying "Oh, hey, I'll just train really hard for a month or two and go win a gold medal at the olympics."  
It is the Dunning-Kruger effect.

Okay, sure, he can let you go through with this and even successfully, but that destroys any amount of verisimilitude the campaign may have possessed up to that point. And most probably paints your him as an irredeemably lousy and boring DM. </TEXT>

4. Crafting is a valid approach to playing the game. Taking that away from your players is silly to the highest degree.

<TEXT> Here's the beauty of a rules heavy system like 3.5/PF: I can immediately give you a consistent answer:  
The AC is touch AC, the result is an automatic sneak attack(if rogue) + Critical [called shot](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/called-shots) to the neck, most likely a debilitating blow, even with a tough foe.  
If it doesn't kill him, it most certainly leaves him close to and rapidly bleeding out to take him the rest of the way to a bloody death.  
Perhaps the guy gets one chance at a grapple check to wriggle free. </TEXT>

 5.5 Enjoy the moment of realization when your party explores that area.  
 5.6 Potentially have one of the NPCs around there be named Ripley.

As far as non-creature challenges:

Doors that cast spells. Things like gaseous form or baleful polymorph or gate or wail of the banshee.  
Areas with impeded, wild or enhanced magic.  
Self-contained planar slices.  
Unconnected rooms. Even a maze of such. Have fun with effects that divert, stop or delay teleports.  
Go non-magical. Give the skill monkeys opportunities to shine. There are tons of reasons a highly magical laboratory would want places where magic absolutely doesn't work.  
Any combination thereof. </TEXT>

They practically have a shadow society of their own.

The whole spreading "terror" shtick doesn't really happen with me. At least not in as overt a way as the stereotype suggest. They'd much rather rule over their lessers, according to each dragon's disposition(which might include terror, less often overt and more often through authority) or complete amongst themselves, for example in Xorvintaal.  
In any case there's a good chance the most powerful individual in a given area is a dragon, appearance notwithstanding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have about 30K words worth of homebrew, so I fear I may be falling into that trap.  
It's worked so far, mostly because it touches on many topics, and only a small subset of it is ever relevant to a particular character or situation.  
But it's definitely becoming almost like a new handbook.

The other is... well, I'd like to say obvious, but it's painful how many get it wrong. For players to have fun, they need to have agency in your world. For them to have agency, they need to be able to effectively reason and make predictions about the events in your world. Which can't happen without consistency, which is very hard to achieve if you constantly improvise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll basically be running a similar campaign soon. How I handle it is:

1. Give players some free LA.
2. Start at a high enough level to allow high-LA races.
3. Allow automatic LA buy-off, based on how PF does it(we won't use XP since it makes things embarrassingly simpler).
4. Allow additional buy-off on top of what PF does, based on the amount of pure RHD.

There are additional option you can avail yourself of. Such as gestalt or PF's race builder system(though you have to be careful there).

It is a bad idea to start with players who are more than 2HD off each other. It is worse if these constitute half or more of the highest HD player.

Understanding the fundamental concepts of ECL, LA, RHD and Class levels is vital here. </TEXT>

They're smarter actually.

They're part of the ancient history of the setting, played a pivotal role in the creation mythos of my universe. They're the progenitors of the normal dragons and most of the hybrid races that exist(such as centaurs, nagas, dragonborn, dragonspawn, etc).

All but a few(Tiamat and Bahamut for example) currently slumber in great fortresses within the cores of stars, sustained by that energy, awaiting the return of magic to the universe, when they will be able to rise again and roam the skies.

<TEXT> Let me pitch in in favour of 3.5.

It isn't perfect, but I consider it an "upgrade" of 5e. It has more content, greater range of play and significantly more content. But not if you only get the base. Core 5e is better than core 3.5e, but all of 3.5e outweighs core 5e.  
Then there's Pathfinder which is released under the OGL and fixed a great many things in 3.5 while remaining almost completely compatible with it(only very minor changes are required to adapt content to and fro).  
In 5e, which I've played on occasion, I feel really constrained in the type of concept I can build. It only supports a very limited subset of generic fantasy tropes and if you want anything outside of that you're fresh out of luck. In contrast, with 3.P I can build playable monstrosities to my heart's content. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Surprisingly well actually. The one time it happened.  
Got an ability bonus and a loyal NPC.

But I've seen plenty of bad accounts.  

Which is why in my game I have the silly deck of many things.  
It creates silly little effects that provide fun role-playing prompts rather than campaign-derailing events.

Things like cursing you with horrible bed hair. Or the ability to grow a majestic beard in the span of a week. Regardless of gender. Or repelling mugs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You DM 3.5e, don't you?

I'm the same. I want the players to know I'm not making shit up out of the blue. I want them to know if it happened once, it will happen again, exactly the same.  
Basically I want them to know my universe obeys the cosmological principle. Precisely because of that expectation of fairness you mention.

However my approach includes slightly more common sense. I hold RaW strictly as nothing but guidelines. That said, the default assumption is there is always a good reason RaW was written as it was, therefore if I have to alter something I exhaust every possible avenue before resorting to house-ruling myself.

I don't actually tack on "rule of cool" explicitly and separately, I let it become an emergent property of the system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ALL FUMBLES are gimicky and stupid.

I bet you even those here who think this instance is stupid have their "yes, but..." preference for a fumble system. While the truth is, fumbles suck as a game mechanic.

They unfairly penalize characters who roll more dice and hit more often. They make players feel bad because they're left at the mercy of the dice.

Remind your DM that the point of the game is fun for everyone, not just himself. If he doesn't agree he can go suck on a cactus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can't make easy comparisons. The game too diverse. A wizard would have scant use of an ability point that can't go to his main casting stat. However he might see a great deal of use of an extra metamagic feat.

On the contrary a fighter who has tons of feats but relies on many different ability scores to be effective, might see a great deal of benefit from shoring up his weaker stats.

So this *"+1 ability score ~= 2 feats ~= 10 skill points"* spiel is utter bullshit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Numbers can always be fudged.  
So that should never be a problem.

What changes at high levels are the stakes. Bring out the exotic locales and the truly cosmic plots. Expeditions to the cores of planets, to divine pantheons, to the depths of hell, flying fortresses in space, the far realm. Heck. It should become *easier* at higher levels, because you can let your imagination run wild.

Too often do DMs get stuck in the D D mindset of dungeoneering adventurers. If you've done your job as a DM well, they should be deeply invested in the inner workings of your world, not merely pine for the next pile of treasure. Your players are no longer adventurers, they are avatars of the gods, of pure ideals, they are forces of nature. Treat them as such. </TEXT>

1. You or him might not be understanding the concept of ECL properly.
2. You are most definitely not understanding the scope of the game. HP damage and AC defences is but **one** of a great multitude of tools the game provides to resolve conflicts.
3. Be glad he chose Monk. Of all things... He's *trying* to make it easy for you.

When a DM struggles with an OP character like that it is almost surely because he is throwing things at the party that this character is specifically strong against. Such as throwing HP dummies at characters with a high damage output. </TEXT>

Me, I'd focus on taking down their commanders and their weather control capability. Then bring in some of your own.

For example:

<TEXT> This is an indicator of a larger issue - and knee-jerk reactions like "banning sex talk" is missing the forest for the trees.

The problem is the BF or both evidently seem to be unable to separate fantasy from reality. Which is sort of a prerequisite for playing this game.

You can't really help them there, but maybe you can use that tendency to disincentivize such behaviour - like have them play unrelated characters, maybe have them play same-sex characters, possibly both male. If one or both are immature enough to let a game affect their relationship like that, chances are they'd be immature enough to be uncomfortable with making fantasy homosexual advances. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Finally, a post of substance in a thread that is otherwise power tripping and completely random, arbitrary rules.

1. This is just personal preference, but I like the volatility of the d20 vs the bell curve rolls. I feel like it provides a nice gradient for characters through their heroic journey, where in the beginning their success is mostly governed by chance, while mighty characters take fate into their own hands(as simulated by the fact that with low modifiers, the relative contribution of the die is great, while as the modifiers get higher, the relative contribution of the die result diminishes significantly).

2. I completely agree with the sentiment behind this rule, but feel like the implementation could be better. Though I'm not sure how to go about it...  
Maybe one of your stats is your affinity(your highest or maybe by choice), and all checks with it receive a bonus. Or - since I like to borrow mechanics from all over - receive advantage.  
You can also logically expand this and require a "weakness", where all checks receive disadvantage.

3. I assume you're aware of the existence of action points? If not check them out.  
Me, I use them to create a fair fumble system - you know, one where those who roll more don't get unfairly penalized. The basics are really simple: It's optional, but you get 1/2 action point for every fumble. The fluff is also neat - you either play a cautious fighter who doesn't risk too much or a daring warrior who takes risks - which sometimes fail spectacularly, but sometimes pay off in just the right moment.

Me, I stick to a specific personal design philosophy - instead of arrogantly assuming I know best, I like to look at what other people have done first, and only if I find nothing, then I start making up shit on my own. I.e. I tend to borrow from a lot of places.

Like for example the "Bloodied" condition from 4e, Called Shots and death at -con(vs -10) HP from Pathfinder, or the advantage mechanic from 5e. One of the few actual house rules I have is the Combat step - it allows you to give up iterative attacks for bonus 5-ft. steps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LA is an adjustment that compensates for the greater power of the race compared to other races.

All it says is that the abilities of the race bump it up in power enough for it to be considered of equal power level as someone of higher class levels, but a less powerful race.

Playing around with LA and racial abilities is the DMs domain. And even then, only if he's got system mastery.

It's impossible to give reasonable answers for unqualified statements like yours.

So either give us specifics - what kind of race or type of character you wanna play, how far your DM is willing to work with you, etc. or just stick to the rules, which are there for a reason. </TEXT>

On continental scales, features like forests, plains, etc. look more "patchy" - not so uniformly clustered. And there's usually clear terrain distinctions due to climate. Your map, despite its scale, looks like it resides in a single climate region.

<TEXT> There's plenty of people who already weighed in on the people problem.

I'm gonna address a small tidbit everyone else missed:
 spend most time when we're not playing scouring the various D D themed subreddits and youtube videos

That will likely leave you with a very skewed view of the game.  
**Read the books instead.** Your time is better spent scouring the actual D D books than browsing subreddits and youtube videos.

I can't tell you the number of times I wished people would just read the books. This is *NOT* a new game. Most of what can be said about the game(and RPing in general) has already been said - and has made its way in the books. All the clever insights and tricks that these outlets keep spouting like some unfathomable wisdom they had to meditate on for 2 years atop a mountain peak to unlock... chances are, it's already in one DMG or another. Believe me, I've read most of them - from 2e to 5e('cept 4e, I couldn't be bothered with that edition). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Technically, yes. Here's the math:

TWF: 2*(die(d6)+enh) + 1.5*str  
2H: die(d12) + enh + 1.5(str + 2)

The die difference is a 0.5 lead for TWF.  
That last +2 assumes the use of power attack, making both styles attack at equal attack bonus. The power attack is usually higher.  
2H is more action efficient however. TWF must usually focus on delivering full attacks.  
TWF is also much more feat intensive. 2H requires just one thing - Power Attack.  
TWF's bonus is mostly in the doubling of enhancements. However, it is often not ideal to take enhancement bonuses. Your gold is better spent in qualitative improvements to your weapons(such as ghost touch or transmuting or the like) rather than quantitative.

Overall, money and action-wise, 2H is the better, more efficient fighting style. Statistically, you do more damage with less action, feat and gold cost with 2H weapons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe you are misunderstanding the concept.

Saying "yes" isn't about anarchy or going wild or throwing away all rules(even if for the sake of fun/hilarity).

Saying *"yes"* is about affording your players with ***agency***. The ability to affect your world in meaningful ways. This is as much about sticking to the rules(because players have to be able to reliably reason about your world to affect it) as it is about allowing them to occasionally pull off something cool or fun, even if it doesn't quite mesh with the rules.

The *"but..."* part is about knowing where to draw the line to accomplish this goal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is partly because it is one of the most obvious and easy to understand problem.

I'll assume you're aware of the existence of anti-matter. Well, when the universe was very, very young(unknown, but we're probably talking less than a second here) its energy density was so great that normal particles(or laws of physics) didn't exist yet.  
Then when it inflated, it cooled down/spread apart - enough for its energy density to drop to levels where the existence of particles was a theoretical possibility. In general creating particles from energy creates a matter and an anti-matter particle - you know, equal quantities of both, preserving all sorts of symmetries. Except, as you are well aware, just by being aware... we're missing some of that anti-matter. (Cuz you know, if it was here it would annihilate with matter and go back to being energy, thereby making you dead.) </TEXT>

Here's how the design process breaks down:

1. The designers need to present both simple and martial ranged options to players.
2. Game design wise, better performing weapons should require harder to obtain proficiencies.  
 The designers chose to play on what a layman would find to be a reasonable assumption - bigger = better. And also on the familiarity of the weapons(almost everyone is aware of the existence of longbows and shortbows). This is a case of the ["Reality is Unrealistic"](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic) trope.
3. Mounted combat DOES NOT perform the same role in D D as it does in real world.  
 In real life it is a tactically significant combat style that brings to a battle capabilities that cannot be achieved in the same manner in any other way. In D D it is a fringe character option, rarely used due to the mechanics of the system. It is by necessity reductionist in its combat rules, and mounted combat is one of the options that suffer. In addition to that factor, there is magic, which changes warfare in ways we usually only scratch the surface of.

**TL;DR** Due to the fringe status of mounted combat, but the familiarity of the general public with the terms "longbow" and "shortbow", they chose to redirect the differentiation between both from what was significant in the real world to what was significant in the game mechanics. </TEXT>

FTFY: Why I don't allow inexperienced players.

Despite the whole *"everyman's game"* attitude towards D D, it is also possible to create games, which do require a certain expertise that actually very few players and DMs possess.

This is one of those games.

I'd give an arm and a leg(the character's) to play in such a game, which is why it makes me doubly sad it died over some hissy fits. </TEXT>

The campaign starts off small and sandboxy. PCs are free to follow their passions. It has a very simple premise: **The rabbit hole is *always* deeper.**

The setting is also pretty generic: Classic high fantasy.  
Save for the fact that I intentionally subvert many of the tropes of the genre and of D D in particular. Mostly by virtue of me introducing the concept of common sense, both in and out of game.

My life's goal as a DM is to see the end of that campaign. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not even about the bad rolls, it's about the rolls period.

"I take 10" is a 2-second statement, which you utter and you're done. Rolling a trio of dice and extracting a result is not a trivial action in comparison.  
This is the "compromise" part I was referring to.

The "important mechanic" part is that the player can rely on a his character possessing a certain ability. For example, if my character has +15 to Climb, I *know* he will be able to climb a generic wall every time. Players work to get that good. Taking that away makes you look like a bastard DM.

So, while much greater verisimilitude is maintained with the bell curve roll, the "take 10" mechanic is substantially superior game design. </TEXT>

And you're misunderstanding what "active involvement" means.  
It's the ***decision*** that's the active part. Rolling the dice is passive.

If a DM imposed this rule in a game, I'd just make him roll all the dice every time I decided to take 10. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The difference between min-maxing and optimizing </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-19 02:18:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yes, I know in a sense it's arguing semantics, but hear me out.  
(Naturally this is most relevant for 3.5 due to the amount of material, but isn't exclusive to it.)
***
I actually believe that there *is* a difference.  
We all know the negative connotations of min-maxing and we've all been warned by a myriad DMs against it.  
Optimizing is kind of the "politically correct" term many people use.

And I do like to optimize. Like a lot... but I don't actually consider myself a min-maxer.

The way I see it, min-maxing is favoring mechanical performance to the exclusion of **everything** else.  
While optimizing means picking an idea and making it work as best as possible within the confines of the system.

I'll take all the flaws and templates and what-have-you I can get away with, use every book, magazine and resource ever published, but I have no problem foregoing "established" tricks to make a character thematically consistent or subvert the expected trope.  
I'll pick an idea(maybe it will be a song, a video I saw, something I read in a book) and try to recreate some cool piece of character design or role, and then I try to optimize the hell out of it.

***

So what do you guys think?  
Is there a difference?  
What kind of player are you(I don't judge, I can max it with the best of them)?  
Do you consider min-maxing and/or optimizing bad?  
Have you had books thrown at you? How did your DM handle power-level disparities?  
Have some of the players you've played with lived up to the min-maxing, murder-hoboing stereotype, and how did the group deal with them? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Just noticed that for x=1.00...00abc, the more zeroes you have, the more *x^y* approaches *(x-1)y+1*.  
Why is that?**

Semi-interesting backstory:
I was designing the mechanic behind a game-mod I'm doing and needed to make something happen 4 times faster in certain cases. Meaning I had to expo my multiplier to the 4th power. Only my multiplier was rather small to begin with. And then I noticed this peculiarity in my maths - it was like raising to the x power multiplied only the fraction by x. Then I tried different numbers and discovered it wasn't a fluke either.

Now I'm both puzzled and curious. But my math isn't that strong so I wouldn't even know where to begin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does such a beast exists somewhere on the internets?  
I need to split a couple of cue/flac files and I cannot for the life of me locate a fast, non-malware looking way to do it.
P.S. Here's the type of awesome software I'm looking for:

Small, free, no install, does one job perfectly. </TEXT>

And how do I make it work? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Quite simply, if you had the power to remove /b/ from existence, would you make use of that power and *why*?

For those that do not know: /b/ is a subsection of the site 4chan and is commonly quoted as the shithole of the internet. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A short PC master race survey </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-31 17:57:41 </DATE>

<TEXT> I'm conducting a study on video gaming and have made a short [SURVEY](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/VJ8ZTWP).
I've looked many previous ones, but none were inclusive enough to provide a decent snapshot of our glorious community(which is specifically what I'm interested in).

I would very much appreciate if you take a minute of your time to fill it out.

Once we collect a decent amount of data(say 200 responses) I'll sift through it and include it back in this post in an easy to digest format.^(that was a problem with a lot of the other surveys - never posting a meaningful result)

Edit:
Well... I guess the site refuses to give you results past 100 responses on the free plan, which is just as well because we've plateaued anyway. Here's a running commentary:

The majority of visitors are young individuals, with the age group of 15-23 making up 75% of all replies, with NA residents being 2/3rds, Europeans 1/3rd and minor contributions from other continents.
Perhaps unsurprisingly then, the most popular genre is Shooters.

What I did find surprising is that MOBAs are actually lower than RTS - and even simulators in ranking.

A lot of you(a third) also spend a full day gaming each week. That's an entire saturday, midnight to midnight spent in front of a screen of some kind.
Being the PCMR, all of you seem to spend that time on your PCs more than anywhere else, with 2/3rds gaming almost exclusively on their glorious rig. The rest is actually spent more on mobile devices - smartphones mostly, but even tablet gaming alone is outpacing the consoles here.

58 of 83 were on Intel CPUs(there were only 2 i3s), on AMD phenoms are still quite popular; 52 out of 85 are on nvidia with the 770 the most popular card, followed closely by 780/660. There was one Titan Black in there. Most of you are still on Win7, but Win8 is hot on it's heels(47/34). There were a few on linux and a few dual-booters(the most verbose people). The one person on Mac put a frowney face at the end.

Here are the charts:

It's been rather educational for me. :) Thanks to everybody who participated. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Reddit Comment Navigator userscript </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-25 03:29:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Time to go full on meta!

So, in a bid to make my life on reddit easier to I wrote a little script that allows you to navigate reddit using the keyboard. You can find it here:

https://openuserjs.org/scripts/subject8211/Reddit_Comment_Navigator

The only issue is - I'm using this [this](https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys) jQuery plugin currently residing on my machine and I'm open to suggestions on replacing that link with something that will be up 24/7.

Feel free to use it as you please and report any bugs. </TEXT>
