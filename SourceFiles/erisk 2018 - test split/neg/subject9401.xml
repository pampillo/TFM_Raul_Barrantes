<TITLE> Unsettling/repressed hiking memory </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 19:45:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (Posted this some time ago but I guess I just wanted some more dialogue about whatever the hell happened)

Messing around on reddit, ended up on the search and rescue guy's posts and read some stuff. Oh boy did that shit bring up a super fucking repressed memory. Actually got sick to my stomach and all clammy/light headed. This is the incident, to the best of memory, that I experienced with my (now passed away) friend I'll call 'James'. The best cure is to talk about it, so yeah.
 
Early 2000's (wanna say summer of 2002) at an out of state campout for the Life rank and above Boy Scout members. Campsite was near the West Virginia-Virginia border, heavily wooded/mountain-ish land and oh so beautiful hiking areas. Our Scout troop was about half way into our week long camping trip when about mid morning, James and I left for our duo hike. We had spotted this small stream the day prior, about 10 minutes north of camp, and wanted to follow it east. We figured we'd use it as an easy to follow path back to camp, especially with the orange markers we'd put up. Even the adults we mentioned it to said it was fine.

The first couple of hours hiking next to the stream was wonderful, James and I cracking jokes, talking about girls etc. After a break for a quick lunch I figured we'd head back, but James noticed a pretty choice rocky hill. Some steep parts to actually climb but gradual enough to walk carefully if needed. I voiced some concern for getting away from the stream but James was a year older and I didn't want to be a wet blanket. I caved and followed after him.

I climbed up after him, slower than he had, and I lost sight of him since he continued on over the top. I felt my skin itching, like after you sweat a bunch and you lay on grass, but about 5x worse. I ignored it because itching and such was just thing when camping. Once I made it the top though, the itching stopped, I spotted James and more importantly took in the view. The overall area looked like a sort of bowl, rocky hills forming the outside and a relatively unrocky inner area/surface. The bottom was a grassy area the size of ~1/2 a basketball court, no trees except for a ragged car sized hole in the ground. James was already walking slowly down the hill, towards the center, but I didn't even call out to him. I just stood there staring at the fucking grassy area with that uneven oval hole. 

Next thing I knew, my foot slipped, and I managed cut the inside of my mouth on my braces, blooding my mouth. The fresh wave of pain sharpened my senses and I fucking panicked. James was almost down at the bottom and I was already halfway down the hill somehow. I didn't hear anything, like anything, including the stream which should've been not ~30-50 yards away. I booked it down the hill and grabbed James pack and yanked him a bit to get his attention. He stopped but didn't even turn towards me. My mouth hurt too much to move it and talk, so I just kept hold of his pack and lead-dragged him back up the hill and down the other side.

It wasn't until back at the stream did I realize I had been and was still crying, like openly weaping. I thought it was just my mouth pain but I finally looked at James. He was white as a damn sheet, tears pouring down his face. We stayed like that for a bit and finally walked back to camp in silence other than a few quick comments to eachother. The odd part is the rest of the week was great, stayed with the group, and  James and I just shrugged it off as semi-dehydrated/heat induced 'incident'. 

Not much else happened in regards to the incident, got really into high school sports and dropped scouting. I did meet up with my old Scout friends at James' funeral the summer before college, which was particularly tragic because it was a suicide and the guy was always full of jokes.

Thanks for reading everyone,
Richard

<TEXT> Hello and thanks in advance.

I would like to know the proper code-name etc for the following:

The user selects/'highlights' a particular set of cells. They then click a macro assigned button, which runs it's code but based on the selectes/ 'highlighted' cell range. The cell range will change.

Thanks

<TEXT> Cheeyah, but for the simpler material form creator excel. It was a combination of vlookup, recorded macro, row deletion based on empty cells etc.

For this one though I'm still trying to look up methods. Looking into combination of loops and index matching maybe. I just feel a bit overwhelmed with options and lack of experience.

I feel like there's a straightforward way of what I'm aiming for, that someone can clearly say "oh just have a do/while loop with a counter   also index match it this way" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Above is the theoretical Material sheet. 

I want the user to go  "I want the form for Order Number S-1", type in a marker somewhere maybe, and click a macro button, filling out the Form sheet with all of S-1's data.

The Form sheet is in the link below.

<TITLE> Macro vba help: getting certain rows of data from a data table, into another excel sheet </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-01 14:58:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Basics: (I'll post a pic to clarify)
1) I have a large data table dealing Materials on one sheet. Each Material has several components (number varies) for each Material. Each component having data related to it (price, weight etc).

2) I'm trying to create a code that allows a user to put an 'x' or something on this Material sheet, then go to the Form sheet, and click a macro button. This then fills out the Form's appropriate spots with info from the Material sheet. 

3) Had a vlookup set up for a simpler version of this. But this one has multiple components/rows for each Material (thus one 'x' would only look for a row).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Crap I wasn't clear. So column B is like Color, Taste, Size etc. Them in column C is the values that vlookup is bringing from another sheet. I've literally typed in N/A for cells that don't have a value. 

So that's what I meant by 'hey aren't we targeting cells with a value of N/A' </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cool!

And since I'm trying to get rid of rows with N/A in a cell, should that be what I'm calling it in the macro? 

So that line of code saying Application.WorksheetFunction.IsNA shouldnt it read Application.WorksheetFunction.IsN/A? 

Or is NA in vba = N/A in a cell </TEXT>

<TEXT> Viper bro thanks a bunch! Modular chunks   'libraries' for sure is a solid idea. 

One last request, how could I tweak it to actually only apply for a cetain range on said sheet. It's only one chunk of rows that needs the n/a deleting function.

Also, should the application.worksheetfunction.isNA be N/A? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello and thanks in advance!

Basics:
Sheet will have data about a material. But materials will have different details provided for each of them. I have it set up with vlookup to call the data into this form sheet. Real general example below.

Material XYZ

 A           B
Color:    Red
Taste:    Sweet
Cost:     N/A
Etc.        Etc

Question: 
I'd like to create a macro-vba code that for a certain section (ex: A1:D30) to find any row with a N/A value and delete said row.

Thank you in advance! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question/Help needed: data table into a 'form' on another sheet, vlookup not as effective </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-11 17:52:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello there and thanks in advance!

So I have a large data table in one sheet that will be continually updated. Materials and their details going to the right in that same row. Different materials will have different details provided (columns are the type of detail provided "weight", "volume" etc) and if material doesnt have that columns' detail, a 'N/A' goes there. 

Pre-setup a form with formatting etc on another sheet, with vlookup in place, so that x calls the material's data-row into the appropriate form sections.

Issue: The form will have rows with 'N/A' because not all materials will have the same details provided. How do I set up a macro/etc to get rid of N/A rows?

Is there other ways of taking one sheets data and calling into a form based on choice, allowing formatting etc.

Thank you again

<TEXT> Also I understand that it's the same as ME1   ME3, thought they'd want to push envelope on races to represent/expand on. Shit the Drell race seemed really interesting. 

The games weren't just explosions in space. It was a giant space opera dealing with a variety of aliens trying to get along/survive/advance.

<TEXT> Wow thanks for all the response!

1) I understand it's actually the 'same' as ME1   ME3, I guess I'm biased because I enjoyed building the larger team in ME2.

2) Some my hesitation I think comes from exploring a whole new system and only one new race to represent that to be apart of squad. It felt more encompassing to have races from that system be apart of team.

3) No Salarian teammate! Mordin Solus was my favorite squad bro. </TEXT>

Anyone know if there's more than 6?

EDIT: 
If you look later on in this post, I bring up the squad situation being less about flat numbers but variety etc. </TEXT>

Not sure what a helper column is and how to the lookup to find x thing, but I'll look into it.

<TEXT> Hey there!

Have a table of data and want certain rows' data to go into a standard form (in another excel sheet). 

More specific/steps:
1) user desires Material A's form, based on data in Material A's row
2) highlights row/ or just clicks hyperlink etc (being able to make it repeatable for new materials)
3) new excel workbook's sheet pops up, in the form's appropriate cells are Material A's data

Should I be going into VBA for it, is there a simple macro to be made etc.

Been looking around and getting wrapped up in hyperlink info and VBA stuff (which I've gotten very rusty at).

Thanks so much </TEXT>
