Also to make $7k in commission this person would have to "cap" their quota and do nearly 3x their sales bucket. If he is doing this this year he must be in the best situation/store in the country.  And literally be top 10 in the country as a rep.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok don't see that you said that anywhere..... But anyway. 

Go online, call, or go to a store and do an actual device change on your tablet line. Then once it's a tablet, and not a phone line, you can move to the $65 UDP. 

It'll be $65 UDP + $20 phone + $20 tablet  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually yeah. Especially when it is busy. They understand that I took some of my time to help them, and either solved some of their problems/questions or gave it an honest attempt. I just say "sir, I honestly can't help you with these kind of questions right now there are other customers waiting and I am a sales person. I would be happy to get you on the phone with tech support to further assist you because they are the experts on these things, or I can give you the direct number and have you call from home where you're comfortable. But it is too busy right now to try to figure out this app I don't know how to use. You're also welcome to come back and if it isn't busy, I can try to help you further but I don't want to waste your time."

Now that's referring to 3rd party apps, password resets etc. If it's a Verizon related issue, like a bill question, or service issue then I will spend more time and get it fixed or get to the point where I can't do anything else. 

I also gauge the customer in those first minutes. They come in with an email issue and I will just ask if they check a lot of email on their phone if they have ever considered owning a tablet and try to transition the password reset to a sales opportunity. If they are clearly not buying anything then they get a more curtailed service.  </TEXT>

And 0% of the time have I ever got a referral that isn't more tech support.

<TEXT> Verizon bills in advance. So you're being charged $110 for this month. You paid for this month on last month's bill. You're also being refunded whatever your old plan was, which you have provided 0 details on. 

Imagine you rent a house. They charge you $50/person and you have 4 people. So at the beginning of the month you paid $200. Then, 22 days into the month, you decided to have 6 new people come in. The landlord also decides to change the rate, to $60/person, retroactively. So, since you've already paid for this current month ($200) next month you'll have to pay :

- $40 (for the difference in the rate for the first 4 people) 
- $96 (for 8 days of each new resident for the past month, at $2/day or $60/mo)
- $600 (full month for 10 people) 
- total: $736



If you want help you need to tell us the details of your old plan, how many contracts and device payments you have, etc. I'm not sure what "important numbers" you think you've posted, but so far we have 0 information about your old plan, and only limited info on what you're now paying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because otherwise shit gets pro-rated and then you have a customer who has mad because they "had 50 minutes left" but got charged an overage because when you current date everything is reduced. 

I'd be surprised if the new plan isnt less expensive that whatever OP had anyway. But we don't know because OP gave no details. Just because a line is $20 instead of $10 doesn't mean anything since each line also had its own data package.  </TEXT>

For Phones, the consensus rating would probably be:

S8  G6  pixel  z force 

My personal preference would be the Z force. I'm sick of Samsung's shitty battery and lag, I don't trust LG. And the pixel is boring to me.

March our quota was 60/17/12k or something. I was 6th in the zone in new lines but still got SMP! since i "only" got 47.

So then I'm on counseling. Quota last month is a reasonable 38. I made 2.6k like the old days! Hooray it's back to normal! All I had to do was sell 18 tabs, 6 Hotspot and 1 hum. $135 ARD and 70% TMP. That got my bucket to 13k or so. 

65/80/13k this month. Annnnnnd I'm not even gonna try. It's not possible. Oh did I mention I'm a B store and we are short reps and usually have 3 sales reps all day? Fun. We don't even have time to make calls and we have no RSS to help anything.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Has there ever been an update on any mobile device ever that didn't have bugs? 

The point is, what you're expecting of Verizon is impossible. There are 100s of different devices operating on the network. They aren't spending hours testing each one to make sure it's the smoothest thing of all time. So many factors can go in to what makes an update bad or not and Verizon has very little control over that. 

If you update and your service stops working (unless its an iPhone where Apple destroys usability of iPhone 6's with every update) then it's a Verizon problem.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe that feature is no longer offered, I know you can't do it on the unlimited plan can't recall off the top of my of head for the other plans. 

So what happens when a feature is grandfathered is that it drops when you make an account change. Looks like your last warning text came on 4/19 in the morning. Later that afternoon you changed the plan, which backdated of course to cover your data usage. This change dropped the feature I believe. I've never changed a plan via text so idk how it does it or what kind of confirmation it gives you. 


I would still escalate the situation of course. I'd probably post the screenshots and tweet at Verizon as well as call and escalate up the ladder. 

You can try a store as well, but they can't do anything for you on a store level outside of getting you on the phone with the correct people. 


Good luck this is a shitty situation.  </TEXT>

However on fi you're paying like $70 or $80/mo for 5GB while Verizon is $55/mo. So over a year it would be pretty similar not even accounting what you spend overseas on fi. 


And when you go over seas you can use your plan as normal allowing you 5GB for that time.  </TEXT>

It's a 4 month program. First month you have to hit 80%, month 2 90%, month 3 and 4 100% and then you're off. If you fail to hit, then it goes into a 6 month window with a similar structure but at that point not hitting 80% will get you canned in all likelihood. 


Still pretty salty about February where our quota was 48 new and I did 30 in 13 days and didn't get 80% because of the the way my schedule broke out. </TEXT>

Good
----
- solid base + commission 
- outstanding benefits
- $8k for tuition 
- lots of perks (discounts, etc) 
- relatively flexible schedule considering its retail 

Bad
----
- not much chance for advancement currently since they are downsizing 
- quotas can be (will depend on a lot of factors) quite high which can be stressful and force you to be cold calling to try to generate sales 
- general retail shitty-ness (hours, dealing with morons, etc)

I've been to Chicago once and had no issues with Verizon and was getting 60-70+ everywhere I was. 

I've read that Verizon is typically amazing in Chicago. However that doesn't mean it will be the best for you. Dropping service in a major city makes me think it could be a bad sim card or something though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What you explained makes sense as a concept but no way it makes sense on paper. 

Let's make it easy and say the phone 7 costs $750. 

So you'd have to pay off $275 more to pay off 50% of the phone. Then you finance the cheapest phone possible (K4), which is $120 (+$30 upg fee). Then you buy a iPhone 6 maybe? For like... $250. 

Now you've paid $675 not including taxes to get out of the iPhone 7 that would have cost you $650 more. 



Just keep the iPhone 7 and decide once you organically get to 50% if another nice phone is worth it to you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can do 2GB, but for a single line there is no reason too. 

5gb is $40 + $20 line - $5 AutoPay = $55 + tax 

2gb is $35 + $20 line = $55 + tax

4gb is $50 + $20 line = $70 + tax 

UDP is $65 + $20 line - $5 AutoPay = $80 + tax 

8gb is $70 + $20 line = $90 + tax

What if I had your personal information and wanted to order an S8? I would access your account, use a prepaid card, and order a 700+ loan in your name. And Id keep the phone for tax. Which is why when you don't use a credit card you can get flagged.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Verizon bills in advance. Your plan change was backdated. This allows the plan change to take immediate effect. That means that you are charged the difference between your previous amount and the new amount, and then the new amount for the next month. 

This happens because you've paid the lower amount for the current month. When the plan gets backdated, the amount for the current month is now higher so you gotta pay the difference.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on what the promo is on the new phone you buy. If you get an S8 or S8+ you can be getting up to $480 in trade in value, which would be over time and you would get no gift card because the bill credits are more than you owe. 

If you got a pixel, there are no trade in promos. So you'd get $200 in a lump sum vzw gift card and $250 on a  prepaid Visa. 


If you want an S8 or s8+ but prefer a lump sum for the promo, then request to trade the phone in as a guest at the store so it's a vzw gift card and not Bill credits.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The v20 is not a phone that is getting returned. And no corporate rep will particularly care about issues down the road it's not like that customer will only come to them or that the rep would even remember them a year later. 


What a corporate rep cares about is making money, wasting time selling a different phone or a pre-order phone are the opposite of that. 


And, when you get a phone shipped from corporate it ships in two days to the consumer, not 3-5 days for them to pick up (insinuating shipping to the store).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. I'm worried. Thanks to a vacation, unlucky scheduled day off schedule and ridiculous quota in February I only worked 14 days and despite pacing if you multiplied by 1.5 (assuming 21 days working) for quota ended at 78%. 


Then last month we had a total lol quota of 60(!) new and 70(!) despite being a B store (the A store 5-10 min away had a quota of 33) and I hit 78% again... And had a fios referral that got messed up and my discrepancy hadn't been approved so that would have pushed me over 80% but didn't. 


So now I'm on counseling despite getting 84 new lines in my last 35 working days, despite a pull through % of 34, 71%tmp, $119 ARD, and the most hums in my store 3 months in a row. 

And it's the first two months I've missed quota since working for the company. Fun times.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you buy full retail you don't get any credit for the sale. Ironically, ime the people who pay full price are also the ones who don't buy accessories yet then also feel entitled since they "spent $800 in your store" to attempt to occupy all your time getting the phone set up. 

If you wanna buy phones at full price for no real reason then the apple store or best buy or online is the place to go. Otherwise, you're not only hurting a sales rep by taking his time but it's actually counting against him when you don't buy accessories or anything. 


I'll sell a phone full retail from my store but then you have to take it and go I'm not gonna also waste my time helping you set it up, especially when you won't listen to common sense and finance the phone with 0 interest.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you have a business account stick to corporate locations. I would not mess with Costco or best buy and definitely not indirect retailers. 

Did you get your account set up online or in a store? I'd find a store rep you like and trust and go through them (for all things related to your business).


Businesses can do 2 yr contracts or DPP. 1 yr isn't really a thing anymore even though the option is there. I'd do DPP if your plan is to upgrade often. That's where you'll likely find the best promos too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The link to the promo does say 30 days but you're probably better off asking tmo about that..


Also, just prepare yourself for billing hell since everything you are doing is reliant on bill credits (see: every Tmobile reddit thread bitching about the bill credit system). Not that there is anything wrong with the deal you are getting but you may need to spend multiple hours each month calling and continually getting things adjusted based on what everyone says over in r/Tmobile.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So FYI, I opened a Tmobile line with a pixel right after black Friday because I wanted to try out their network 

This is when they were advertising heavily about the pixel promo. I took my phone in and not only did the employees not think it would work on their network, they also didn't know what a pixel was and had no idea about the promo until I had them look it up. So if there is a small print stipulation, I would not be surprised at all for them to not know it because I don't think they get a lot of people doing that promo (esp not now that's it's cooled down)  </TEXT>

The gist is, you port to Google voice. The port takes exactly 24 hours. So once you initiate it, during that 24 hour period you change your Verizon number. The port goes through and your number is in Google voice and Verizon service remains active with a new number.  </TEXT>

Your deposit got reduced to $125 BECAUSE you brought your device. As you stated, you were ineligible for device payment based on credit so for postpaid that means you would have a "$400" deposit and then have to pay full retail. When you pay full retail (or BYOD as you did) the deposit is reduced to $125.


After 6 months that will be reevaluated. Pay your bill on time/early every month and you will have a decent chance to finance in 6 months.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah just go to a store so they can explain it. 

Basically, you're not on a contract plan. The plan you are on is the amount of data, minutes, texts etc that you have. 

How you pay for your device is separate. There are no more 2 year contracts. The only way to upgrade is via device installments. Depending on your service plan your line fee may or may not change (it probably will go down assuming you're on a modern plan)  </TEXT>

But I'd set up your personal apple ID using Gmail. Save contacts and calendars to your Gmail account so they will sync whether you have an iPhone or Android. 

For the other iPhone, make it a family share account with a unique ID. It will have its own data but be able to share app purchases. Rely on Gmail for contacts and such. </TEXT>

Not to mention, your "huge premium" is hardly more than a non UDP customer AND you aren't paying for a home ISP.

The trade in money is applied at POS (currently since there are no bill credit promos), and can be used as a down payment, to cover taxes or accessories, or it will cover your taxes and the rest goes to the bill. The gift card comes in 6-12 weeks and is visa cash you can use it on anything.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Had a problem today getting someone to have simultaneous voice and data on the Samsung 930u (and his wife has the 935u). S7/edge unlocked models.

Is it a whitelist problem or are the phones not capable of voice and data on verizon because of CDMA? Any ideas appreciated. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've been looking for a large home for myself and 8 guests. I found a great spot with a decent enough price and requested to book. 

The host didn't respond within 24 hours. Does this mean I can't rent the home? Do I try to request again to either get accepted or get a formal denial? 


It charged my card when I requested, then said it refunded. I requested again since I don't really know the protocol and get charged again (which is fine), I assume that's normal too? 


Is there anything I can do as a brand new guest to airbnb to get a host to accept my reservation? 



Any help on the above questions and general tips greatly appreciated, thanks!

<TEXT> Anyone else experience this? I had an old s5 and decided to order the pixel to have as a backup phone instead. When I put the trade in it gave me $43 normal value and $87 promotional value. Can't find anything to corroborate that or why it gave extra value. 


Anyone else have the same "problem"? Trying to figure out if my friend should pay off the $165 he owes on his s6 instead of edging up.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> First Dbrand skin - Moto Z Force </TITLE>

<TEXT> Randomly saw the marble skins go on sale via an add and decided to pull the trigger. Application was super easy to do, just following the steps of the video. 


It's got a precision cut and fit, and I can confirm all 4 mods work as I have all of them. It also fits fine with the bumper case. The skin looks great with the black phone and is a really authentic looking marble. Super pleased and will be a repeat customer for sure!

<TITLE> [Help] is there a way to turn off the "night mode" in the Z force camera? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-03 23:08:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Title says it all. The camera has this default night mode where a moon icon comes onto the camera display. It makes there be like a 3 second delay to capture a photo, despite there being enough light for shot. 

Is there a way to disable this? It's really hard when I'm in my living room with dim lighting to take a picture of the cat or food because the camera wants to pause to allow more light in I'd guess. 

I can't find a way to disable it outside of going to the pro mode which takes away the moon but still has a slow shutter.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Samsung tab s2 (SM-T817V) controller help </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-30 06:25:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So as I'm sure the people in this sub are aware, Google doesn't seem to have an answer for using controllers on a non-rooted TB s2. I'm running marshmallow 6.0.1, and using the Mupen64 FZ app. 


First I tried a wired Xbox controller with otg and could get nothing, though it worked flawlessly on my Moto z force. So now I am trying a nyko core wired ps3 controller as I read that should be plug and play. 

With that, I can map the buttons, and if I do the controller diagnostic everything registers fine. However, in game I can only use left Joystick. Nothing else registers. I've tried changing the emulation profile, input profiles, using custom input profiles, etc... Nothing works. 


Al I missing something here? I'd much rather use my tablet to game the my phone and the controller is a necessity. 

Thank you for any responses.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Discussion] Any Droid Z Force users? General thoughts? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-06 02:08:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello Motorola fans!

I am wondering if anyone has the Droid Z force (or Droid Z for that matter) and what their overall thoughts are on the device? I have a note7 now, but because of the recall I could switch to a different phone if desired. 

I am intrigued by the phone, and I like the idea of the mods - particularly the battery one. I just wish I could try the phone out. I mostly am just wondering what people's impressions are, and also if apps can actually be put on the SD card or not (and actually run properly). 




The main thing that scares me is well, I was burned really badly by Motorola customer service with my custom turbo 2. Making matters worse is that I am a Verizon wireless employee and they still treated me like nothing - and I'm supposed to sell their phone! 

The short version was that my custom turbo 2 randomly had half the screen turn like inverted colors in January. I paid $25 for a warranty claim and was told it would be 4 days. Then a week. Then 7-10 business days. Then I was told it would ship within 10 days and I'd get it after that. 2 weeks in and no phone because it's out of stock. Which well, yeah makes sense it's a customized 64GB how many of those can there be that match mine? 

Anyway, eventually they agreed to give me a code for a new phone, I'd get an email in 48 hours. For weeks I'd call every 2 days and explain my situation, from scratch, and get nowhere and nothing but a runaround. 

Long story shorter, I ordered an s7 edge and it came before my moto came - the moto finally came through 3 months after the original order in late March.... And that was only after scouring the internet and coming across some random moto forum user named karimoto who helped me. 


So understandably I am scared to ever own another moto phone because of that. I also am now spoiled on the camera from the s7 edge and note7. I have read that the moto actually runs games smoother because it has better software, and with a battery mod I feel like it should have the best battery on a smartphone. 


Anyway, TL;DR what are your guys thoughts on the Droid Z force? 


Thanks in advance. I have no interest in an LG so it's either wait for a note7 or switch to the moto </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is there some easy way to access this app/feature? Currently I have to go to the file manager and get to the pdf file then "open with" 

I want to just be able to have the PDFs save in write on PDF but there is no app icon, and I can't search for it in settings. 

Feel like I'm probably an idiot and the answer will be obvious but I'd appreciate the tip. 




EDIT TO ADD: anyone with the same question try the "xodo PDF Reader and editor" app </TEXT>

<TITLE> SD Card in New phone </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-21 15:36:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I recently switched from the s7 edge to the note7.  I had all my spotify music downloaded to the SD card on my s7 edge, however when I open spotify on my note7 (with my SD card inside) none of my songs show up as downloaded. 


However, my SD card is still the same amount full so the songs are there. I guess spotify can't recognize it? Further puzzling me was that when I went into the file manager to see if I had two spotify folders or something - which I do - neither one appears to have any content. 




Tl;dr

Anyone had success popping your SD card into a new phone and having your spotify music show up as downloaded?  </TEXT>
