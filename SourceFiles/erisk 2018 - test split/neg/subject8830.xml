<TEXT> I find the Fermi Paradox kind of amusing. It is based on hypothetical musings and with numbers that could be wildly off. I do believe there is life out there somewhere, but am not near convinced that it is as abundant as theorized and may very well not have advanced to life to the capability of higher conscious thought. Think about how abundant life would be on earth if the human evolutionary tree had died out. Massive life, but none that will ever even think about, let alone try and contact, other life forms off their home planet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The electrical current will continue to increase trying to force the motor to move and you will hopefully blow a fuse or pop a breaker before burning up a motor. What is actually happening is that the spools of wire inside the motor, although they look like bare wire, are insulated and too much current causes the wires to heat up and the insulation melts and shorts the wires together. The smell of a bad motor is the plastic insulation having melted and one or more if the "legs" has grounded out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely see that. So, do you think no one should complain or try to get a situation changed unless they are smart enough to know how it should be changed?

Might you expand on you answer in light of my comment? Either way, thanks for your honest answer. </TEXT>

Of course, Bill Clinton and plenty of Democrats are probably in the same boat, but, it seems at least, that they hide it better and don't get caught as much saying stuff about it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> By your rational, the only people who are pro-choice wouldn't be having babies because they hate guys. Unfortunately, you are so wrong. I like guys and kids and am still pro-choice. I PERSONALLY would raise hell if someone tried to abort my child and am quite disheartened that the woman's sexual partner does not have the ability to stop an abortion, but I seem to be in the minority in this regard and am OK with prevailing laws. I think your argument is completely based equating aborting to murder and use that as a distorted lens to see those with a different opinion than you. You do not need to change your stance on abortion, but you would benefit greatly from trying to understand others. Especially those with whom you vehemently disagree with. Good luck and good day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This position is hard to explain, but it probably has a name. With the guy in missionary between the woman's legs, remove penis, place left leg over her right leg (or vice versa), so he is straddling it, then lift her left leg over/in front of the guy. The guy will be straddling one leg with the other bent (hamstring towards his belly) in from of him. Reinsert penis and enjoy a very nice change. Flexibility is not needed, but getting into this position may be slightly awkward the first time or two. Very nice transitional position going to doggy style. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Childhood's End is a book. Arthur C. Clarke. It was a very interesting book. If you are into Sci-Fi books, I cannot recommend any without putting Rama at near top of the list. Of course i have not read the bulk of his work, but 2001: A Space Odyssey, Rama, and The City and the Stars are worth stopping everything right now and ordering. I offer, you only, a money back guarantee on those 3.

<TEXT> Yeah, even the 22g 1.5 were huge. Also, my nurse said to get 3cc syringes which turned out to be very inaccurate for .5 a week. A Redditor talked me into using .5 (yes half inch)  27 or 28 g .5cc insulin syringes. They do take longer to draw, maybe a 45 seconds to a min. and slightly longer to inject, but not that long (30 seconds or so). Best decision I could have made. It goes in so much better. And I got 100 for $20 out the door.     

     
Regardless, go with a higher guage (25 at least). Even if you use the lower to draw with. I use the same to draw and inject with. Actually have like 45 left of my 18   22 guage individually sealed if you want them for the cost of shipping. Seriously I'll  never use that big again. Good luck. </TEXT>

My argument was stealing land that is often in violation of Israeli law, not building houses. As for anyone firing rockets at Israel, that is wrong as well. Although, using horrible tactics, such as rockets, was used by Israel themselves to take the very land they now call Israel so it is interesting that they condemn such actions by those who they are stealing land from. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, it means that anyone who voted never sways from voting democrat voted for her. She wasn't horrible in context of comparability to her opponent or experience, but in the sense of being out of touch with progressive values and being horrible scandal-ridden. In hindsight she would have been better. As I said recently, better a WallStreet puppet than a Putin puppet. Personally, I think many independents thought Trump might moderate his policies from that of his rhetoric and we are finding the opposite to be true.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It isn't that "science" has any bias inherent in and of itself, for it is just the accumulation of data through the scientific method. I have never heard an argument against the scientific method, though I am sure reddit will finally enlighten me to any out there. That being said, every person who applies the scientific method has their own bias in trying to find answers to the hypothesis they are testing. As a psychologist there are means by which we try and avoid having these biases taint our data. We have others help set up our experiments so we can take into account things our biases may prevent us from thinking of, use random selection so we don't pick people who might conform to our biases, we do double blind studies, when possible, so the researchers nor the participants know who is getting what treatment, etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although, technically possible, I personally think it would be a disaster for many reasons. 1) as mentioned, Hacking. Not just vote minipulation, but I bet we would have a much higher percentage of people voting without actually having more people vote, if you know what I mean. 2) This removing of another step in the effort to get involved in politics, if even voting every couple/few years, would turn it into a circus with clowns instead of the quazi-humans we have running government now. 3) Finally, the amount of privacy lost to do this would be HUGE! I mean, to be able to reliably know who is voting and why they are voting (harassment, forced, etc). Our cellphones would have to be publicly monitored much like they are, presumably, doing now behind the backs of the public.    
    
     
Now, I do think you could take many of those issues and modify them to a direct vote application.  </TEXT>

I grew up with an alcoholic mother who had agoraphobia. I have heard A LOT about panic attacks from her and others and I do not envy those who get panic attacks. I get anxiety attacks, but they are nothing compared to wanting to die. I do hope it is a phase. I do not mean to rain on that hope, but you should be able to look at family and personal history to give you an idea if this is passing or just a shitty occasional tribulation.  Either way, know that you are not even remotely alone.

<TEXT> I just meant not formatted for Reddit. There is a way to have line and stanza breaks, but no prob. I know a lot of people are reluctant to share. I'm exactly the opposite. Actually, your poem reminded me of a therapeutic poem of mine that I just posted to /r/justpoetry. Thanks for the memory if nothing else. </TEXT>

<TITLE> In Loving Memory </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> All I wanted was a little love    
But all you could give me was a little shove    
Into a murky pool of social isolation    
Now Im drowning and naked    
Cuzz you couldnt make it     
To hear this poem being read    
Though even that gives me voice, though no choice    
To get out these words, you might think absurd     
Yet I have no doubt, that without them     
I wouldnt have found a way     
To be here tomorrow    
Let alone, today     

I remember when you held me by my shirt collar    
You screamed and you hollered    
You had a knife in your hand    
Stabbed it into the night stand    
  asked me how I wanted to die    
But in the 5th grade     
Dad  I still thought you were the greatest guy

<TEXT> Those are swing states. In these states not only is there the need for a candidate with a highly polished resume (Hillary's being quite tarnished), but someone who can bring people to the voting booth. I believe that almost ANYONE other than Clinton could have won. Conservatives rallied against her on specific, if not valid, points and "progressives" were SUPER sore about how the DNC treated Sanders. Unless we are in WWIII, I highly doubt that my 2 yr old would lose to Trump next election. Biden had all the good about Clinton without much, if any, of the bad. If he runs next election, Biden will probably win....unless there is another highly motivated progressive.     


     
TLDR: Biden had all the good and none of the bad of Clinton and those swing states, along with most of the rest, actually had low turnout.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honesty, I had never heard of Gabbard before she endorsed Sanders so I am skeptical of her having the name recognition needed. That being said, no one had heard of Obama either, so maybe with. HUGE push from Sanders she might have footing, but would still probably lose to Biden. Sanders on the other hand, would probably take it. Still Warren has the name recognition, voting history, is a woman (which, yeah yeah yeah, shouldn't matter) and I think people would get over her not supporting anyone during the primaries. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I would feel the same. I know not everyone believes that two wrongs don't make a right, but I was raised that way. Saving tax dollars does not seem like a good justification for killing. And since the death penalty does nothing to prevent such crimes, it being a deterrent can't be used as an argument either. So basically it comes down to, in my opinion, people who have too little compassion or really care about money that much. Both reasons are unbelievably horrific to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do "we" really believe that a horrific decision cannot change a person?  It turns out that my father beat his first couple wives. They both hid his kids from him, which was probably good at the time, but he eventually found god and became a SUPER compassionate man. I knew him in his druggie anger days and that buy who spent his last decade plus living as a missionary in Ukraine. I don't know if this guy changed. But I think there is both an ethical and moral argument to be made, like out forefathers made, for there not to be "cruel and unusual punishment". Sadly, many, if not most, people are not so enlightened to see this.

<TEXT> This is my I-expect-downvotes-for-being-honest comment. Your statement is true. Karma gives me a true psychological boost. Most of my OC posts go nowhere and, though often berated, reposts have a true value in this and most social media realms. By value I mean that people appreciate them for some length of time. Since people are introduced to things at different times, these and all the FB clutter often propagate long after some people are tired of seeing it. There was a reason I didn't post it to /r/progresspics and titled it in a way that did not indicate this was me: I just like sharing things I think others will appreciate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is an interesting paper, but I feel it might be a bit dated. The paper was published (2014) a year before a massive piece of this glacier broke off (2015). The paper itself states that better imaging and and more research is needed. This article I posted clearly states that the images that showed the crack growing for 2 years wwas almost missed by these researchers and was probably missed by those before them. I'm not saying head for the hills straight away, but it seems quite likely that they are on to something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once Bonded 

The day has no feelings
Tasteless, colorless,   wanting
I was the day
Till your presence
Dominated me
Refusing me
Even a glance
Enticing me
With your torture

Finally you took me
Without warning
Breaking my will
With a compassionate severity
I always deserved

Then my heart came
To be too delicate
As my need for you swelled
With each of my punishments

The pain I asked for
Was never enough
It was your absence
That I could not bare
You cut loose the leather
Severed the cuff chains
Showing it wasn't role play
 You truly were a sadist.

But I thought, 'let's give it a go anyway.'  
I knocked on the door.  
A man answered.  
I asked if the Lady of the house was in.  
His eyes narrowed and he asked, "why?"  
"I'm just inquiring about her services", I said.  
"What kind of services", he asked with a perplexed tone.  
"Well, the red-light services" I said bluntly.  
He started screaming and flailing his arms and body about.  
I walked home, alone, only slightly disappointed.   </TEXT>

  out of me comes it all   
Dirty words comforting loneliness  
As emotions wrap themselves in filthy sheets   
Passion turns to angry thoughts   
That are confined in padded walls  
Oceans of solitude are rippled with false hopes  
  frames confine the universe  
While tears and blood mingle no longer  
The endless beating has ended  
Words do tricks like playing dead  
Emotional insanities inside my head  
Temptations arm reaches into moonless nights  
Mercy cries dance out of pregnant wombs   
So kiss me, kill me, but dont say you love me  
For out of me comes nothing.

<TEXT> Sometimes wine makes a beggar out of me.  
When the moon softens,  
Before the cock of morning   
I wander, looking, through the streets   
Till I chance upon your likeness.  


Sometimes -   
You are the wind chiming through the leaves   
And I have found you   
in moonlit shadows of sleeping feline.  
Once you even took to metaphor   
written on a temple door.   


Sometimes, wine makes a beggar out of me   
Though, sober or stupor,    
I shall always be   
Loves beggar.

Her emotions not shared by her alone  
My soul seeking to touch hers  
Or just a glimpse from afar would fill my need for her  
I knew nothing of loneliness until we met  
Mere seconds were apart are endless torture  
If there was no time, with her I would spend eternity  
I long to bath in the ocean her eyes behold  
To flow along the river in her veins  
To pulsate within her heart, that we may become one  
Within her I feel complete  
She fills me with a wholeness Ive never known 
Alone I am myself, but with her I am so much more.

Dancing my praises to the sun    
Each has kissed me while I kissed you    
  blessed be, they are not done

Comfortably held with temporary anchor

We grow from others   
Then teach each other new ways   


You - You!

But all you could give me   
was a little shove     
Into a murky pool of social isolation.

Cuzz you couldnt make it    
To hear this poem being read    
Though even that gives me voice,    
though no choice    
To get out these words,    
you might think absurd
Yet I have no doubt, that without them    
I wouldnt have found a way     
To be here tomorrow    
Let alone, today     
  

I remember when you held me     
by my shirt collar    
You screamed and you hollered    
You had a knife in your hand     
Stabbed it into the night stand     
  asked me how I wanted to die     
But in the 5th grade     
Dad  I still thought you were the greatest guy.     </TEXT>

During our little escapade, we soothed each other     
  during my drunken state the bartender stared     
  during all of this, I said I loved her     
Though I dont think she believed me     
     
Before we soothed each other, we were so lonely     
  before I walked into the bar, I was sober     
  before I said to her, I love you     
I wasnt sure that I believed it     

When all was said and done, we were good together     
  when all was said and done, I left the bar, towards her house     
  when all was said and done, I still loved her     
  I think shes starting to believe me.

<TEXT> And so, for the last time I looked into his eyes    
I knew it.    
He knew it.     
There was nothing we could do.
Staring, without words,     
just the understanding of it all   how it had to be    
I took his hand, reassuringly,
breathing him in deeply    
breathing him out slowly    
feeling the relaxation of him in me.
My heart sank.    
Sank into the loneliness that was to come.    
I knew no present pleasure in a fading moment    
  understanding it all, he let me be alone    
But stayed by my side,     
holding me,     
loving me,     
in a silent sensual way.
So it was, us, together for the moment     
But time went on,   the moment passed us by         
  again, we were two lonely lovers.

<TEXT> I asked for book suggestions by Clarke with good endings and a Redditor suggested it. I found a PDF online and after the second/third chapter didn't really care if the ending wasn't great (which it was), because the premise was so fascinating. It keeps you engaged throughout and, as I mentioned, does, IMO, have a very satisfying ending. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have been doing this for a short time and it is working great. The key is to not over-indulge on the non-diet days. What I do is eat normal one day (like an average of normal) and on my diet day I drink only water (usually soda) and only eat rice and vegetables for the day. So my diet days are a bit extreme, but I know I can eat normal the next day which really helps.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> A couple was invited to a swanky Halloween party. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-29 05:20:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The day of the party the wife got a terrible headache and told her husband to go to the party alone. He being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed, and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went.

The wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain, and as it was still early, she decided to go to the party. In as much as her husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him.

She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice chick he could, and copping a little feel here and a little kiss there. His wife sidled up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived

She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and messed around.

Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away and went home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behavior.

She was sitting up reading when he came in and asked what kind of a time he had. He said, "Oh, the same old thing. You know I never have a good time when you're not there."

Then she asked, "Did you dance much?"

He replied, "I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance. When I got there, I met Pete, Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker all evening. But I'll tell you... the guy I loaned my costume to sure had a real good time!"

Parasitic    
Stinging from the saltiness

My hands will not unclench from around yours    
My feet will not carry me from the danger    
My heart will not trade ruin for emptiness     </TEXT>

I KNOW someone is going to walk in and I will share their awkward feelings. But, I am thinking of trying to force myself watch awkward scenes in hopes of getting over this issue.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Food assistance: Would Jesus dictate what foods could be bought?
(Of course he would probably cook for them instead, but the government cannot afford to make meals for all people who receive assistance)

Healthcare: If Jesus was a doctor, instead of carpenter, would he charge to heal people? Would he be against universal healthcare?

Wages: Would Jesus not pay his workers enough to feed and shelter themselves while he keeps huge profits?

I'm looking for serious dialogue about how you think Jesus would have us handle these, or other, economic issues in today's world. Faith healing and miraculous dividing of food is not a realistic answer. Humans cannot do these things. </TEXT>

The point is, we all do things that are out of line, disrespectful, hurtful, etc. and if you haven't apologized recently, well, maybe you are a Saint...but probably not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read a comment on Reddit telling someone they might like Stephen Baxter's NASA trilogy and ordered all three. The original thread was about the Odyssey books and expected something comparable, but halfway through book 1 I'm wanting to gouge my eyes out. So boring! It looks like book 2 is similar and no real action happens till book 3, but that may be just as technically eye-gouging. I thought Time ships might be better, but saw a review that made me think twice about that too. Any suggestions? Or should I just move on? </TEXT>

<TITLE> What book could you just not finish and why? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-10 13:30:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have 2 that come to mind. The first is A Tale of Two Cities. I started it while I was backpacking Europe in 2001, but found it quite boring. Though the main reason for not finishing it was having to look up definitions of archaic words in the back every page or two. More recently, I saw a Redditor suggest Voyage by Stephan Baxter. I was over zealous and ordered it and its two sequels. 300 pages into the 600 page book and I finally read the wiki summary on it only to find out it is a "hard science fiction" book. WTF does that mean you ask? It means it's boring! Full of a lot of unexciting build up to no big climax. The second one sounds better, but I switched to the Space Odyssey series which had me hooked a couple pages in. We'll see if I get back to Baxter's trilogy. </TEXT>
