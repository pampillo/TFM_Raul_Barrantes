<TEXT> You are confusing two different post-Conquest myths on the Conquest of Mexico. 

[Hernan Cortes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Hernan_Fernando_Cortes.jpg/800px-Hernan_Fernando_Cortes.jpg)' hair was brown/black, not red. One post-Conquest myth said Cortes was the return of Quetzalcoatl based on an unsubstantiated myth that somehow turned a semi-mythical Toltec king of the same name into a white man.

[Pedro de Alvarado](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Alvarado.jpeg) had red hair and had the nickname Tonatiuh, the name of Aztec sun deity. It is disputed whether his nickname came from his red hair or some other esoteric quality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anthropologists in the 19th century used to believe that man originated in Europe based on skeletal remains from Neanderthals. It was only with the discovery of older hominin remains in Africa that they stop to reassess their model. Anthropologists changed their model as more and more earlier hominin remains were recovered in Africa and not in Europe.

Thus if the oldest homo sapien remains were recovered in China and their context and age are secure, we would have to stop and reassess our model on human origin and evolution. Either humans originated in China or we have yet to find even older remains in Africa. If more old remains continue to be found in China and not in Africa, the model would have to change. If we find older remains in Africa than the ones found in China, the model would simply need to adjust for the earlier migration date from Africa to China.

These models rely on data. As new data is presented models have to change to accommodate the data. It's basic science.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Incans had the Llama and Alpacas which were both able to be used to pull wagons once carts were introduced by the Europeans yet never encouraged the Incans to pursue wheel tech . 

Have you been to the Andes? Do you know how mountainous it can be? Carts are only so effective in that region even with Inca roads (which were not broad flat roads like today).

 or anything iron for that matter

Several Native groups made things out of meteoritic iron.

 a lot of the soil in the Americas really needs to have an iron plow to really be able to effectively cultivate the ground

What are you basing that off of? Because the Americas were able to support tens of millions of people just fine without the plow.

 ith a vigorous trade network, ideas and concepts might have been able to spread more easily and thus the Native Americans might have develop the social and cultural conditions that helped the Eurasians become more technologically advanced in contrast to the Americas.

That's kind of a huge assumption to make. You make it sounds like history is a game of Civilization where everyone starts out at the base of a predefined tech tree working towards a common end. History isn't like that, at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A team led by Timothy McCoy from the National Museum of Natural History recently conducted tests on several beads made from meteoritic iron recovered from a Hopewell site near Havana, Illinois. These tests concluded that the meteoritic iron used to make the beads matched samples of meteoritic iron excavated at Anoka, Minnesota. This suggests that some sort of trade was occurring between the two sites. There are two competing models of trade for the Hopewell. One system relies on goods and ideas being traded with neighboring communities and the other is based on individuals or groups physically going to and returning from more distant locations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've been reading *Correspondence Analysis and West Mexico Archaeology: Ceramics from the Long-Glassow Collection* by Roger Nance et al. on the side. In the background chapter by Phil Weigand, Phil describes the Palacio de Ocomo. It is the only publication I've come across that provides details of the *tecpan* despite excavations going back to before 2013. The excavators just have not published anything, though I think they submitted reports to the government which are hard to find. It's just nice to finally read some details.

Just for some measurements, the final construction of the *tecpan* measures roughly 125 meters a side. It encloses a space that is 60 meters by 70 meters. The highest preserved point of the *tecpan* measures 6 meters. Unfortunately due to its close proximity to the town of Oconahua, many of its finely shaped stone slabs that once covered the structure were mined for other uses like house foundations and a bridge. Phil said these slabs measure  40-50 centimeters a side and some of them were even carved with symbols and possibly glyph (he doesn't include pictures/drawings, though). There's not very many pictures of the structure floating around on the internet yet despite the site being registered with INAH. Oconahua is kind of out of the way to visit. You can see some shots of the *tecpan* in this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJwu1j3_Wx4) with Monty, the lead archaeologist of the project. He's a cool dude and he used to work at Los Guachimontones.

I hope Monty publishes more on this structure. It's an important and large building for West Mexico dating from the Epiclassic to Early Postclassic. This was a time of great change in the region when people were no longer burying their dead in shaft and chamber tombs, constructing *guachimontones*, and creating the elaborate and lively hollow ceramic figures that grace many museums across the world.

/u/400-rabbits, I think I recall you asking me for information on the Palacio. If you would like, I can scan the pages and send it to you to read. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part of that is a result of sample bias based on the testing of mostly non-African populations and the other part is the result of reduced genetic diversity due to a founder effect as people migrated out of Africa. A small population left Africa as early as 100,000 years ago. That small population held just a fraction of the diversity from the entire continent. So as the population settled other areas with smaller populations splitting off to travel further, the amount of genetic diversity is further reduced. According to the founder effect model, the last places settled by humans tens of thousands of years ago should have the least genetic diversity. As it stands, Native Americans have some of the least genetic diversity on the planet since the Americas were the last continent to be settled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, agriculture was independently invented in the Americas. 

To copy/paste an answer I gave [previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1uji41/why_was_there_gap_of_over_100000_years_between/ceipxd9/)

 There's a number of factors that can contribute to this answer and the debate has raged on for 100 years. Factors such as population density and a dwindling food supply are often mentioned, but I am of the mind that it was the weather. Up until 12,000 years ago the climate around the world fluctuated from hot to cold and back again in intervals as small as a decade in some cases. This makes it extremely difficult to cultivate plants to grow in a certain climate if the climate is never stable. 12,000 years ago marks the Holocene and we have had a relatively stable climate that allowed people to settle down and begin farming. Whether that is, in fact, the case or not is still up for debate but the fact remains that people just were not able to farm before the Holocene.

 [Richerson, Peter J., Robert Boyd, and Robert L. Bettinger
2001, Was Agriculture Impossible During the Pleistocene But Mandatory During the Holocene? A Climate Change Hypothesis. American Antiquity 66(3):387-411.](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/AgOrigins_2_12_01.pdf)

To quote the source cited 

 "Might we not expect agriculture to have emerged in the last interglacial 130,000 years ago or even during one of the older interglacials? No archaeological evidence has come to light suggesting the presence of technologies that might be expected to accompany forays into intensive plant collecting or agriculture at this time. Anatomically modern humans may have appeared in Africa as early as 130,000 years ago, but they were not behaviorally modern. Humans of the last interglacial were uniformly archaic in behavior. Very likely, then, the humans of the last interglacial were neither cognitively nor culturally capable of evolving agricultural subsistence. However, climate might also explain the lack of marked subsistence intensification during previous interglacials. Ice cores from the thick Antarctic ice cap at Vostok show that each of the last four interglacials over the last 420,000 years were characteristic by a short, sharp peak of warmth rather than the 11,600 year long stable plateau of the Holocene. Further, the GRIP ice core suggests the last interglacial (130,000-80,000 BP) was more variable than the Holocene, although its lack of agreement with a nearby replicate for for this time period makes this interpretation tenuous. On the other than, the atmospheric concentration of C02 was higher in the three previous interglacials than during the Holocene, and was stable at high levels for about 20,000 years following the warm peak during the last interglacial. The highly continental Vostok site unfortunately does not record the same high-frequency variation in the climate as most other proxy climate records, even those in the southern hemisphere. Some northern hemisphere marine and terrestrial records suggest that the last interglacial was highly variable while other data suggest a Holocene-length period of stable climates ca. 127,000-117,000 BP. Better data on the high frequency part of the Pleistocene beyond the reach of the Greenland ice cores is needed to test hypotheses about events antedating the latest Pleistocene. Long marine cores from areas of rapid sediment accumulation are beginning to reveal the millennial scale record from previous glacial-interglacial cycles. At least the last five glacials have millennial-scale variations like the last glacial. The degree of fluctuations during previous interglacials is still not clear, but at least some proxy data suggest that the Holocene has been less variable than earlier interglacials." </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's one thing making a raft and crossing a short body of water between islands. It's a completely different thing to cross an entire ocean and land on another continent.

Take Cyprus for example. It's only ~80 kilometers from Turkey and ~100 kilometers from Syria. And yet the island remained free of human activity until some hunter-gatherers created a kill site around 10,000 BC. People did not settle the island until 8200 BC. 

So you want to tell me that people were somehow able to cross the Pacific ocean by boat to settle two entire continents, but they couldn't sail to an island in the eastern Mediterranean that was only 80 kilometers away? I just don't buy it. </TEXT>

I would be doubtful of that. People did not begin settling Polynesia until 3000 BC. They did not reach Hawaii and Easter Island until after 1000 AD. Even the newer models of people populating the Americas before 14,000 BC suggest traveling along the coast, not full on sailing across the ocean. </TEXT>

<TEXT> COD: Famagusta

You and several hundred Venetians in an aging medieval coastal island fort defend against tens of thousands of Ottoman Turks in September, 1570. Your only hope is holding out and getting relief from Venice, the Papal States, and Spain if they can move fast enough. You have to deal with Ottoman cavalry charges, sappers, marksmen, and artillery. Your commander, Marco Antonio Bragadin, orders you and a small contingent of soldiers to sneak out of Famagusta and wage a guerrilla war against the Ottomans. You roam across the fields and mountains of Cyprus as you disrupt Ottoman camps, supply lines, harbors, and fortifications. Friendly Cypriots who do not want to fall under Ottoman rule can aid you and your men. Unfriendly Cypriot will rat you out to their new masters. You are the only thing stopping the Ottomans from completely controlling Cyprus, the eastern Mediterranean, and maybe even all of Europe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those of you that cannot read the article, the authors determined that the cave paintings at Guerrero were painted over a period of time. The famous enthroned figure and the jaguar and man pair have been dated to 2200-1980 BC and 1520-1410 BC, respectively. These dates come from calcium oxalate that forms on the surface of rocks. These early dates put the art style at Oxtotitlan to before the rise of the Olmec culture. It throws into question what constitutes "Olmec-style" artwork if this art style predates the very people it is named after. Much like the Mixteca-Puebla style being found in Nayarit centuries before its presence in Oaxaca and Puebla. </TEXT>

The excavators noted that some of the higher status houses were bare of artifacts which may indicate that they knew of the impeding invasion soon enough to pack up valuables. Lower status houses were not so fortunate. I'm really amazing at the ring and chisel that were found. If either object were to break they would have been melted down and remade into something new. The fact that they were left behind speaks volumes about the impeding Inca attack. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Metallurgy may not have come from the highlands, though. Instead, coastal Ecuadorians and Panamanians may have been the source of metallurgy for West Mexico and then the rest of Mesoamerica. This is based on the style of artifacts (bells, tweezers) and the methods of making items (using sheets (Panama) and casting (Ecuador)). So you would have to ask why coastal Ecuadorians and Panamanians did not get llamas from the mountains before you ask why Mesoamericans did not get llamas from South America. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The lecture references thousands of sources. Maybe millions.

I asked if you had sources that was not the lecture. Not whether the lecture had sources. We've already established that you refuse to relay any of the lecture's sources to us.

 You called them landlocked.

They are landlocked. The Triple Alliance is made up of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan. None of these city-states are on the ocean. Tributary provinces were largely autonomous and were only required to provide tribute. If they failed to provide tribute, they were punished. Hence the term indirect control. That means the Aztecs were landlocked since their own territory that they physically and directly controlled was not on the ocean. Comprendes? 

 My point is not arguing against genetic similarities. My point is that they don't TEST them. Meaning that's not the standard they use in determining if this or that is Maya. Just if they speak Maya.

Are we talking about modern or post peoples? Because you can't directly test language for past peoples. You can indirectly test it through writing. And when we identify Maya peoples in the archaeological record, we look at multiple sources of evidence such as their art, architecture, burial styles, tool types, ceramic types, etc. It is more than just language. When you make the same sort of comparison between the Aztecs and Hopi you find they share very little.

 So you don't think two Native American groups who both speak Uto-Aztecan languages and come from the same places of caves have ANY similarities?

Do you know what a language family is? It is a very broad category in which multiple languages are grouped together based on linguistic characteristics. While Hopi and Nahuatl are under the same broad category, they are not similar enough to be mutually intelligible. Their common language was thousands of years in the past. Thousands of years which allowed languages to change over time. In that period of thousands of years, so too did their respective ancestral cultures. They changed so much that the Hopi do not have feature caves in their origin mythology

http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/hopi/toth/toth002.htm

So no, they are not similar.

 It's the same as a French man and a Chinese man?

No, I used Poland the Mughal Empire. Both speak an Indo-European language (!!!! a broad category !!!!!), but neither group could understand one another. And neither group shared very similar histories or cultures as you are suggesting with the Aztecs and Hopi. </TEXT>

 Yes

Do you have any sources that are not the lecture?

 So now you admit they DID control it. So you were wrong.

I said indirect control from the start, you failed to read.

 It was not weak when dealing with a technologically equivalent civilization.

It was weak since they were continually putting down rebellions from people who did not wish to pay tribute.

 Copout. Their shared history becomes whatever one of them is, as the defining factor is those who speak Maya. 

Just because one group may experience something does not mean all groups did. This is as true now as it was in the past. Events in Belize, for example, do not necessarily affect those in Yucatan or Guatemala. Likewise, events at Chichen Itza would not necessarily have affected those at Kaminaljuyu.

 There is no Maya blood test.

There most definitely are genetic similarities between Maya peoples. Why would you even try to make such a claim?

 All Uto-Aztecan peoples have a shared cultural history.

Maybe thousands of years ago long before the Aztecs or Hopi were a culturally identifiable group. But that does not mean that the Aztecs and Hopi were in any way similar in the early 16th century. Since you say they are, what are their defining historical and cultural similarities? </TEXT>

 You're a moron.

Don't resort to insults. It weakens your argument and position and makes you look immature. 

 They controlled from coast to coast. https://i.redd.it/j9s79gucemny.png

As I said, indirect control. How many of those territories retained their rulers and merely offered tribute to the Triple Alliance? The answer is, most of them. The Aztecs were toppled by the Spanish and Tlaxcallans because their control over their empire was indirect and weak. If they wanted to go out and conquer someone, they first raised troops from their three member cities before relying on any of their tributary provinces. Ross Hassig explains troop recruitment in his book *Aztec Warfare* (1988).

 There is huge overlap. Maya are defined as people who speak Maya languages. That's literally it, for example.

No, the Maya are defined by their shared culture, history, and language family. The Aztecs do not share the same culture or recent  history with people in the Southwest. As I said, it is like the Polish compared to the Mughals in the 16th century. </TEXT>

---

Indirect control over other territories does not mean the Aztecs had access to the ocean. The Aztecs, after all, inhabited just three cities in the Basin of Mexico. So yes, they were landlocked. 

 Also all UtoAztecan peoples are their cousin cultures from the place of 7 caves. Including people like the Hopi

You are confusing a language family with cultures and peoples. People can and do freely adopt languages and cultures that were not initially their own. Uto-Aztecan is also divided into northern and southern branches of which Hopi is part of the northern branch and Nahuatl part of the southern. While both branches had a common point of origin, that origin was many thousands of years ago long before the Hopi and Aztecs cultures developed. These two cultures are as similar as the Polish were to the Mughals in the 16th century despite both groups speaking an Indo-European language at the time. </TEXT>

As I said in my post above, intermediaries were most likely used between the Southwest and Central Mexico. The pochteca would not have physically traveled to the Southwest. This is supported in part by Book 10 of the Florentine Codex. The Aztecs only described a handful of different cultural groups, all of them in close proximity to Central Mexico. If they had traveled as far as the Southwest, would descriptions of the people and places not be recorded? </TEXT>

If they are correct, the Bajio is still very far south of the American Southwest. It would make sense that Nahuatl speakers would not have a word for buffalo.

As for the Pochteca actually reaching the US Southwest, "pots are not people" as the saying goes. Goods may have reached the Southwest from Central Mexico just as goods reached Central Mexico from the Southwest. That does not mean that people in both locations physically traveled from one point to the other. Instead, intermediaries were most likely used that helped move goods along. The same can be said of goods like jadeite from the mountains of Guatemala being found in Central Mexico. Trade goods are traded through many hands before they reach their final destination. </TEXT>

Looking at your post history, it looks like you anger a lot of people. I've already warned you about your behavior on /r/Mesoamerica. It seems like that warning was not headed for all of Reddit  I'm disappointed. You seem enthusiastic on the topic of Mesoamerica, but are unwilling or unable to have a discussion on and engage with the literature. It speaks volumes on your immaturity and intellectual insecurity. I hope you can improve or else Reddit will be a very lonely place for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Has anyone heard of the Maguey Plan before? Adela Breton made copies of it which are now in the Bristol Museum. Apparently it records households in Tenochtitlan? I'm not entirely sure,

http://museums.bristol.gov.uk/details.php?irn=230507

Also, I was taking another look at the site map sketches of Los Guachimontones that Adela Breton created. I finally realized why the two maps look so different. They do not depict the same site! [This map](http://museums.bristol.gov.uk/details.php?irn=229150) depicts the ceremonial core of [Los Guachimontones](http://i.imgur.com/S1Pfu3g.png). But [this map](http://museums.bristol.gov.uk/details.php?irn=229149) is actually a map of [Loma Alta](http://i.imgur.com/bMRAwNQ.png) located further up the hill from Los Guachis. Breton failed to draw the ballcourt correctly for Loma Alta leading me to think that she drew a weird version of Los Guachis. So that's cool. I also took a look at the scrap book of photos and confirmed that two of the photos were of Circle 1 and one photo was of Circle 2.

I am curious about another sketch that Adela Breton produced. This sketch was of a stone relief at [Cerro Guzman](http://museums.bristol.gov.uk/details.php?irn=229147), Jalisco, Mexico. I have very rarely seen stone reliefs from Jalisco. My guess is that this is from a Postclassic relief. I just wish I knew where Cerro Guzman was located. My Google searching has not quite found a place where this could be unless it is suppose to be near Ciudad Guzman just south of Sayula. </TEXT>

 [Mexico was mostly Nahuatl speaking until the Mexican revolution and the dumb meztisaje Meztiso make everyone speak a Spanish propagandaaaa](https://www.reddit.com/r/nahuatl/comments/66pqtn/buffalo/dgl67yf/)

Yeah, you did.

 Why do you think Malinche the random Maya slave was fluent.

Malinche wasn't Maya

 And I said there is NEW evidence.

 https://audible.com/pd/History/Maya-to-Aztec-Ancient-Mesoamerica-Revealed-Audiobook/B00TKIYO46

Can I get something that not an audio book?

 Your argument is broke as Nahuatl speaking Mexican army traveled where they'd be alerted to buffalo

 Wherever they have been or traveled, Pochteca traveled a thousand miles more

A thousand miles or more? So you're saying since Nahuatl speaking troops accompanied the Spanish to the US SW, the Pochteca thus reached Canada? They reached Kentucky? Because both of those places are a thousand miles from the US Southwest.

<TEXT>  They've found Maya evidence such as tropical birds goods since then from the Maya up north. New discoveries.

Yeah? Mind providing a source? Or are you confusing the presence of the scarlet macaw found in San Luis Potosi to the macaw remains found at Casas Grandes? If so, the exchange required no Maya people.

 There is no evidence to the buffalo numbers that you claim. The natives did not kill them in such numbers to decrease them in population as you claim.

I said that Natives managed the buffalo numbers before Europeans arrived. After the arrival of Europeans, disease and colonialism took their toll on Native populations and Native populations declined. With less Natives hunting buffalo, buffalo numbers were able to grow in number. Savvy?

 There was no push for nationwide Spanish during the New Spain era. They kept them speaking whatever. Marching their newly conquered armies of hundreds of thousands of Mexicas north and South

But there were other people besides the Aztecs and they spoke other languages that were not Nahuatl. To say that everyone in Mesoamerica spoke Nahuatl is false.

 Place of Seven Caves is in the American Southwest somewhere

lol no. The Aztecs themselves said they only traveled a hundred leagues or so before reaching the Basin of Mexico. That would place Aztlan and the Seven Caves somewhere in Guanajuato. And based on early Postclassic evidence in areas like Jalisco and Hidalgo, it would seem that Guanajuato is the place of origin for these Nahuatl speakers that intruded in the region.

 They saw buffalo and recorded it in their libraries

 It's just burned and lost to time

Sound like a convenient excuse, but one that does not answer why a word for buffalo or bison does not exist in Nahuatl. You would think the term would be recorded in Molina's dictionary or even Remi Simeon's dictionary compiled a couple of hundred years later. Yet both dictionaries lack any words. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Umm the settlers killed the passenger pigeon and the buffalo

 Meaning the buffalo extended even further before

No. As I said, with a reduced Native population the numbers of these animals grew. Then Europeans came in and began hunting them to or towards extinction.

 The long arm of the Pochteca was reduculous...both south and north

The Pochteca traveled far, yes, but not that far. You honestly think an Aztec trader traveled all the way to New Mexico for turquoise?

 and if they've found evidence of Maya in the US

They did not. You are referring to Richard Thornton's work? It is pseudo-archaeology

 Also Spaniards took the Nahuatl speaking Mexican army when they did the California missions and tried to conquer random parts in the south west

So? Your map doesn't show buffalo in California or Arizona. And by the time they appear in New Mexico it is the 1800s, long after Spain's early colonial expeditions with Aztec troops.

 Mexico was mostly Nahuatl speaking until the Mexican revolution

That is completely false and ignorant of Mexico's heritage and its people. It completely ignores the multi-ethnic nature of both pre-Columbian and colonial society in Mexico.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, that map does not show their extent in pre-Columbian times. It shows the extent of the buffalo since the 1800s. Between 1492 and 1800 disease and colonialism took its toll on Native peoples. Without Native peoples in sufficient numbers to help manage the buffalo population, their numbers grew. Just like the passenger pigeon. 

And even if they were in northern Mexico, that does not mean Nahuatl speakers would have a word for them. Nahuatl does not extend as far north as northern Mexico. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sabine Hyland recently discovered several khipus in a small village. The khipu are thought to record information among the Inca from simple accounting to complex histories, but no one has been able to decipher them. Hyland believes that using a combination of colored strings and knots, 95 unique chord patterns could be produced for a logosyllabic-style writing system. Not only is the color of the string and style of knot important, but so is the fiber type and direction of the ply. This means one would need to feel the khipu as well as see the khipu. However, the khipu documented by Hyland are thought to date to the 18th century, centuries after the conquest of the Inca. This throws into question the continuity of this historic khipu to pre-Conquest khipu. The article ends with a tantalizing passage about an old woman who told Hyland that she used to read the khipu as a little girl before darting off to tend her herds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. And there is doubt as to whether people were actually sacrificed as a result of playing the ballgame. Most of the imagery alludes to the Hero Twin myth made famous in the Popol Vuh. This myth has deep roots in Mesoamerica and has appeared in art and iconography among many of its cultures. The imagery may thus be referencing this myth rather than depicting actual sacrifice. The lack of skeletal remains that can be securely attributed to both sacrifice and ballplaying further supports the idea of the referential nature of the imagery to the myth.

Edit: The ballgame is also linked symbolically to warfare and the passage of the sun. Disputes could be settled with a game rather than with physical conflict. Part of the reason the Spanish banned playing the game was because of its many layers of symbolism and deep connection to the religion of many Mesoamerican peoples.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. And there is doubt as to whether people were actually sacrificed as a result of playing the ballgame. Most of the imagery alludes to the Hero Twin myth made famous in the Popol Vuh. This myth has deep roots in Mesoamerica and has appeared in art and iconography among many of its cultures. The imagery may thus be referencing this myth rather than depicting actual sacrifice. The lack of skeletal remains that can be securely attributed to both sacrifice and ballplaying further supports the idea of the referential nature of the imagery to the myth. </TEXT>

The variation in isotopes confirm that Napoleon's army was made up of soldiers from all over Europe. It also confirmed that some people may have had more access to better foods or meat than others. While this may not be surprising for those that study Napoleonic history, the findings confirm written records and help to bolster their truthfulness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The jungle reclaiming many areas of the New World where people once thrived. A number of factors resulted in the reclamation such as abandonment or decimation from colonialism and Old World diseases. 

Take the Maya Lowland area, for example. Towards the end of the Classic period the area once looked like Ohio with broad open fields and low hills. People were continually chopping down trees to construct their homes, construct their cities, and burn for fuel in their cooking and plaster making fires. Plaster making consumed more wood for fuel than any other activity including construction. One of the reasons Chichen Itza looks so nice compared to earlier Classic or later Postclassic cities was its use of cut and shaped stone. With so few trees in the region, the Maya opted to use less plaster on their buildings and conserve their trees for construction and cooking. Normally the facing of a building was very rough and made from cobbles or loose fitting blocks that were then covered by a thick layer of plaster and decorated into things such as masks or friezes. By the time Mayapan rose near Chichen Itza, enough of the jungle had regrown and reclaimed the land to allow the Maya to switch back to using plaster to cover their buildings. This is one of the reasons why Mayapan is sometimes described as a "smaller, shittier looking" version of Chichen Itza. The cut and shaped blocks withstand the elements better and look nicer.

The other example is the Amazon rain forest. When early Spanish explorers first went down the river, it was described as densely populated with towns and villages never leaving one's sight. With the discovery of *terra preta*, an artificially created soil that holds onto organic material and minerals better than the natural jungle soil, it was more than feasible to farm in the Amazon. Farmers today use plots of *terra preta* for their own practices because of how productive these plots can be. Combine that with a better understanding of Amazonian orchard practices in which people purposely plant and spread food producing trees in order to have secure sources throughout the year, and it is any wonder why people once doubted early Spanish accounts. Unfortunately, disease and colonialism took its toll. With the jungle environment being so aggressive in reclaiming land, these former settlements were quickly swallowed and buried. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel less bad now, thank you. 

I do need to improve my style of writing, though, so I sound like less of a pretentious douche bag. I try not to, but it always seems comes off like I'm a huge dick. I think I'm much more personable and friendly in real life when I talk about these things, but who knows? Maybe I am a dick and no one has bothered to tell me that to my face.

 BTW that's not how I had imagined the game would be played at all. For some reason I had a volleyball type game in my head where the ball wouldn't touch the ground, but this seems to be almost entirely ground based with the ball rarely getting of the ground. I really don't know how I got that idea in my head.

I seem to recall a similar thing where the ball had to stay in the air. It would make sense given the sloping nature of the lateral platforms to provide bounce for the ball when it rolls off. But then, not all lateral platforms are sloping such as Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza or Ballcourts [1](http://i.imgur.com/kkSqNJZ.jpg) and [2](http://i.imgur.com/oiLXCRM.jpg) at Los Guachimtones, the site of my research, or the [ceramic ballcourt models from Nayarit](http://collections.lacma.org/node/253572). So I'm not sure what to think anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  What really annoys me about /r/history and Reddit in general is the same repetitive comments made on a popular post. Take [this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/65ot26/mexico_revives_3000yearold_ancient_ball_game/) on Mexicans trying to revive the Mesoamerican ballgame by having a tournament at Teotihuacan. Awesome, fun, interesting. [Except almost all the comments can be boiled down to "DAE remember Road to El Dorado?" and "Will the losers/winners be sacrificed?" ](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/52/ac/e8/52ace8179b4aeb5eca02a3d77368682d.gif)

Does no one read the article and comments before posting? It's not a long article and it addresses the latter question quite clearly. It kind of bugs me.

But I want to know if I am doing badhistory related to the topic of sacrifice and the ballgame. I have tried looking for sources that discuss skeletal remains linked to sacrifice from playing the ballgame. I haven't come across any. Do any sources exist? If so, can you please share?

If no sources exist/no remains have been recovered, is it still fair to say Mesoamericans sacrificed people for playing the ballgame? Personally, I say no. I think the art and iconography depicting this event references the mythological story about the Hero Twins made famous in the Popol Vuh. We know that this mythology is old, it is referenced in the Preclassic murals at San Bartolo. It is also not uncommon for Mesoamericans to depict themselves in the positions of gods or figures from myth in their artwork. I think it is fair to say that at this point we do not believe Mesoamericans sacrificed people for winning/losing a ballgame. This can, of course, change if new evidence is found. An I wrong in telling people this? Should I let them continue to believe that all this sacrifice was going on when it might not have?

Your input is greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  but it is safe to say that many groups in Mesoamerica descended or were strongly related to these two in many different ways, especially language, religion or trade.

Not at all. The only cultures you could maybe make that argument for is the Olmec and Teotihuacan. Even then, both of these cultures did not influence everyone or everyone equally. Give credit to Mesoamericans for being their own unique people able to create their own unique culture without being descended or influenced by their neighbors. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  For example, I read an article once that claimed that sacrifice and cannibalism of sacrificial victims came about as a means of providing protein, which due to the lack of domesticated grazing animals, was lacking in the Mexican diet. The pomp and ceremony of sacrifice was still there, but the historian also argued that it had serious practical benefits.

Oh, Harner's old article? That has long been debunked. Harner's failed to realize that Mesoamerican food provided all the necessary proteins. Between corn, beans, squash, and the occasional deer, water fowl, snake, lizard, frog, etc Mesoamericans were not deficient in protein at all. </TEXT>

To better convert Mesoamericans to Catholicism, the Spanish banned things that were deeply rooted in their native religion. For another example z the Spanish banned amaranth, a type of grain.

I am unaware of any publications which have described ballgame sacrifices. I have gone hunting for publications on this topic and turned up nothing. While it is possible I could have missed the publications, I have also not come across any citations that failed to come up in my searches. 

 However, the archaeological remains of ball courts at major city sites seem to regularly depict a winner/loser outcome in which the local residents are always the winner. This likely suggests a ritualistic game with a sort of power dynamic, administered by the elites.

What kind of remains are we talking about? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'm not here to have an academic debate

So I guess it is a moot point to ask you for sources on things like:

* Having a sacrificial site that is part of the game complex is material evidence of a relationship

* We have multiple, indepedent sources that all indicate it was a thing

 The degree of evidence you're demanding in this particular case is absurd

It's really not. In Mesoamerican archaeology if you want to make a claim such as this, you need multiple lines of evidence that hold up to scrutiny. This is the same level of demand one would make for claims of other forms of sacrifice or cannibalism. You need to rule out other possibilities without ruling out your explanation. Cut marks on a bone could as easily mean sacrifice as it does with cannibalism or ritual fleshing for burial. It is other lines of evidence, both a part of the remains and the context in which they were found, that help support one hypothesis over the other.

This is kind of the whole point I am trying to make. There may be iconography attached to pre-Columbian beliefs and mythology at many Mesoamerican sites. And there may even be oral history from descendant communities regarding who was killed. But without physical evidence that can establish the link between the sketal remains of sacrificial victims and ballplaying, this remains an unsupported hypothesis. Requiring that physical evidence is not demanding or absurd. It is simply the proof required to verify a hypothesis. As an unsupported hypothesis in popular culture, this has taken on its own set of information and mythology that is repeated by people such as tour guides and tourists. What art historians and archaeologists see as iconography of the Hero Twin myth repeated on friezes and murals for ballcourts, others see this and think it is proof enough that sacrifice occurred without considering other possibilities. 

Art and iconography in Mesoamerica, like any other place in the world, can be represented of ideas and beliefs rather than facts and historical events. We cannot accept art and iconography at face value as being 100% grounded in physical reality. Art and iconography is open to interpretation and is layered with symbolism and belief. This includes the depictions of ballplaying and sacrifice.

I have enjoyed debating you on this subject. I hope I have not come off as too dickish. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oral myths still require physical evidence to support them. Sacrificial sites in proximity to a ballcourt is meaningless. Sacrificial sites are nearby to a lot of things. You must bridge the connection with other supporting evidence.

What we need to support the hypothesis of people being sacrificed for having played a game is skeletal evidence. We know that playing the ballgame leaves behind wear and tear on the bones of individuals. What would cement the connection is a non-fatal fracture in the skeleton in one of those locations as a result of playing the ballgame. Then we would need physical evidence of that person having been sacrificed. 

I don't even know where one would expect to even find a ballplayer sacrifice. The centers of courts normally contain ritual caches, not human remains. Perhaps if the person was buried nearby that would be your solid connection between sacrifice and ballplaying. Even if you find skeletal remains with evidence for playing the ballgame, you need to establish that they were sacrificed in response to a game. Anything else leaves out the possibility that the person sacrificed just happened to be a ballplayer.

 I'm not doxxing a friend on the internet. They work at a tier 1 research university--I'll leave it at that.

I'm asking because I want to read their publications on the topic. I want to see their argument and proof that sacrifice in response to ballplaying was a regular occurrence and not one left to iconography. It's the internet, I can't take your word on whether this person exists or not. I could equally say that I am best friends with a high profile actress and also say I do not want to dox them. I understand if you don't want to say who they are, but you can't rely on them as a source to back your argument when others cannot look up that source and verify your information. Is their PhD in Anthropology or a related field? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This is not unfounded--there is a reason to believe it. 

I would say it is unfounded as there is little physical evidence that players were sacrificed for having played the game. If you are arguing that iconography means there is basis in truth for all things depicted I would like to see you defend the existence of feathered serpents, world trees, and earth monsters. 

I will concede that like the crucifixion of Christ, a single instance of sacrifice involving the ballgame may have imprinted itself on the beliefs of many peoples in Mesoamerica. That is not to say that people were regularly crucified or sacrificed as part of their respective religions. Simply the iconography was repeated to allude to a past event.

 And I've never heard that the winners or both teams were killed. I've only ever heard one version, including the one from the PhD giving me a tour of the site.

And who was the person with the PhD? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a myth because it is a "[a popular belief or tradition that has grown up around something or someone](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/myth)". This myth just happens to be based on an unproven and debated hypothesis regarding iconography and art. Just look at who is said to be sacrificed in each telling of this myth. I've heard the winners were killed, the losers were killed, or both teams were killed. This myth is given as a blanket statement for all cultures in Mesoamerica who played the ball game with no regard for time, location, or people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am happy to see more and more people in Mexico wanting to learn to play and actually play the Mesoamerican ballgame. I was kind of hoping the article would go into some more depth on the topic such as how a variant of the game survived in Sinaloa called Ulama. What does annoy me is the article's repetition of the myth that people were sacrificed, winners or losers, for playing the ballgame. While there is a ton of imagery and iconography in Mesoamerica related to the ballgame, with some imagery related to sacrifice, there is little physical evidence that people were ever sacrificed for winning or losing a game. Being a ballplayer carried an immense amount of prestige and status within many Mesoamerican cultures. We see this in imagery from all over. What we do not see is a lot of imagery of sacrificing ballplayers outside of a mythological context. Some ballcourts may have friezes depicting said sacrifice, but they allude to stories and myths of the past like the Hero Twins in the Popol Vuh. An analog could be the depiction of Jesus on the cross. Most churches do not nail someone to a cross every Sunday as part of their normal worship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They do, but you are limiting the amount of possible mutations by having a smaller sample size to draw from. 

Think of a bowl full of Skittles. It has an assortment of different colors that were randomly dumped in the bag at the factory. You take a handful out and set it on a table. You just took out a fraction of the possible colored Skittles to the point where you may not have any of one color like yellow. Now take that handful and divide by half. Now you have a fraction of a fraction. Continue until you are down to just one Skittle. Is that one Skittle representative of all the diversity within the bowl from where it came from? Not really.

That's essentially the founder effect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, the Toba eruption did not cause a genetic bottleneck for humanity. We do not see the same bottleneck happen to other animals or in other humans (like Neaderthals). What this bottleneck is, is the result of a founders effect as humans spread out of Africa. You have a small group that leaves Africa and has only as much genetic diversity as the members that leave. They settle in a spot. Eventually a group of them fission off to settle in another spot further way. This group has only a fraction of the diversity of the group they fissioned from. Repeat until humans have spread across the globe. What you find in this pattern is what you should expect. The point of origin, Africa, has the most genetic diversity on the planet. The last places to be colonized by people, like the Americas, exhibits the most genetic similarity.

And as [Petraglia](http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070702/full/news070702-15.html) has discovered, tool types show a continuity before, during, and after the eruption in India. India would have been hit the hardest by ash fall. There is some debate on Petraglia's findings, but considering the founder effect and the lack of bottleneck in other species, it is likely the Toba eruption played a small role in killing any homo sapiens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. The dark side is just one side of the range of emotions someone can feel. You cannot purge yourself of sadness, anger, jealousy, or hate. But you can fight to control it, to temper it, and to let it not rule you. You do that by recognizing that they are valid and real feelings and to feel them does not make you evil. The Jedi asked too much of people to deny an inherent part of themselves. By attacking that side, by trying to drive it out they succeeded in only driving into the deepest and darkest corners before it could come out again and wreak havoc. You must embrace it and only then will you find balance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part of the the idea came from novels written in Spain shortly before and into the years of colonization. One of these novels, *Las Sergas de Esplandin*, gave California it's name. The state is named after Queen Calafia, a fictional queen who ruled over Amazonian women

Also, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Cities_of_Gold_(myth)) says this,

 In the 16th century, the Spaniards in New Spain (now Mexico) began to hear rumours of "Seven Cities of Gold" called "Cbola" located across the desert, hundreds of miles to the north. The stories may have their root in an earlier Portuguese legend about seven cities founded on the island of Antillia by a Catholic expedition in the 8th century. The later Spanish tales were largely caused by reports given by the four shipwrecked survivors of the failed Narvez expedition, which included lvar Nez Cabeza de Vaca and an African slave named Esteban Dorantes, or Estevanico. Eventually returning to New Spain, the adventurers said they had heard stories from natives about cities with great and limitless riches. However, when conquistador Francisco Vzquez de Coronado finally arrived at Cbola in 1540, he discovered that the stories were unfounded and that there were in fact no treasures as the friar had described  only adobe towns.

 While among the towns, Coronado heard an additional rumor from a native he called "the Turk" that there was a city with plenty of gold called Quivira located on the other side of the great plains. However, when at last he reached this place (variously conjectured to be in modern Kansas, Nebraska or Missouri), he found little more than straw-thatched villages. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seeing as how many Caribbean communities were trading with one another, long distance coastal trading around the Yucatan peninsula, possible trade routes from northern South America to Western Mexico, and extensive coastal trading along the US and Canadian Pacific, it is certainly possible that Native Americans could have reached Europe in time. However, history and people do not follow a sequential tech tree in which one development automatically leads to another development. People are not predestined to follow the same route to get an Alpha Centauri science victory. People have agency and make choices, both beneficial and harmful choices, for themselves. Just look at people today. We continue to pollute our planet with excessive plastic waste, extensive deforestation, and burning fossil fuels to satisfy our energy demands. Despite us being aware of the harmful long term effects of our actions, we continue to do them. So if Native Americans did develop long distance sailing vessels, they may not have chosen to use them to go that far. Just as China sailed as far as East Africa without going further. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Someone from home had shared this [blog entry](http://www.coppercountryexplorer.com/2017/04/quincy-ravine/) on Facebook about how a ravine used to traverse a large part of our town before it was filled in and built over.

What caught my eye, however, was an entry on a building that used to be on [Tezcuco (Texcoco) Street](http://www.coppercountryexplorer.com/2017/03/milwaukee-house/). Now, I knew we had a Montezuma Avenue and a Montezuma Park, but I never noticed a Tezcuco Street in town. That may be because it is only a few blocks long and there is only one road sign that actually names the street. I find it a little funny that you have these Nahuatl (or Anglicized Nahuatl) names all the way up in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. I'm really curious as to why these names were chosen way back in the early history of the area. Did some city planner happen to read a book on Mexican history and thought it would be fun to use these names? Were they chosen simply because they were exotic? Is there a treasure hidden in the area Nicolas Cage is destined to find? I don't know and I'm not sure who to ask, but I would like to find out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, slave labor was not used to construct the pyramids of Mesoamerica. However, corve labor, or unfree labor, was mostly used by Mesoamerican peoples for construction (Abrams 1994). The difference between slavery and corve labor is simple. Under slavery, a person is owned (permanently or temporarily) by another person and must do what is asked of them within the bounds of society's laws and rules. Corve labor is a form of tax in which people are required to contribute a small amount of time to the state for public or royal projects. This labor is largely restricted to certain activities like construction of pyramids. Beyond the small amount of time one needs to contribute to the state, people are largely free to do what they want (within the bounds of society's laws and rules). 

Even the largest pyramids in Mesoamerica, like the Sun Pyramid at Teotihuacan and the Great Pyramid at Cholula, were constructed using corve labor. Both of this structures, mind you, were not constructed in one single construction event. Rather, both of these pyramids are created from smaller pyramids which were simply expanded. Each expansion of the pyramid, while itself an massive undertaking, reduced the amount of laborers needed during each construction season and created less of a burden on procuring construction materials in time for building. Instead of 5,000 people all trying to work on a pyramid and have it finished before the rainy season destroys the unsealed construction fill of earth, clay, or mud bricks, you can have a few hundred people work on a construction stage over the course of several years (or several decades and centuries depending on the pyramid).

While corve labor may be used extensively by the nobility to construct their pyramids and palaces, people within Mesoamerica also constructed their own smaller pyramids and other buildings. Carballo (2012) has argued that the Aztec commoners used collective labor for their projects. Collective labor is essentially a group getting together to work on something for the betterment of the group. There is some corve labor involved, but the demand for labor is not from an individual but rather from the community. The community expects aid in their construction efforts or other activities. That means helping someone harvest their crops, improve their house, or clearing a field of trees for a new farm. In return by contributing towards the community you can expect the same level of contribution from members of your community when you need something done that you cannot do yourself. Collective labor can be used to construct smaller neighborhood pyramids of lower quality. While the quality is not as nice as pyramids commissioned by nobility, a pyramid built by a community is still something greater than any kind of pyramid an individual may try and construct on their own.

I hope this answers your question.

<TEXT>  We have solid proof that humans were smelting copper and casting it into pre-made molds since ~8,000 BC at the latest. There's just no way that multiple independent cultures were practicing relatively advanced metallurgy, yet it took them all another 3,500 years to figure out how to make a wheel. For reference, the city of Rome was founded less than 3,000 ago.

Maybe perspective will help in understanding how rapid our advancement in technology has been. It took all of humanity 192,000 years to first begin using metals. That's 7,680 generations. Just think, stone tools are only a couple of million years old and predate Homo sapiens. It took until our species to go from stone tools to something else. That's damn impressive given how relatively new our species is compared to other animals and plants whose ancestry is much older than ours. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But I will reiterate, not everyone lives near the coast and would have been affected. You cannot get all your resources from the coast. By necessity one would need to establish inland sites to take advantage of obsidian or chert outcroppings, timber, and wild foods and animals. And if the civilization was large enough, the inland sites would be significant in size. They would leave behind a ton of evidence of their activities.

Now, we obviously have not discovered everything, but based on what we have discovered there is little support for the idea of an advanced pre-Ice Age civilization. It's only supporters are people like Graham Hancock who does not do any field work of his own, only misinterprets other people's work to support his narrative. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Also, the east coast of North America has a greater amount of Clovis sites found AND they are older than the west which really stirs things up. The Solutrean hypothesis looks at the possibility of Europeans traveling over a Northern Atlantic land-bridge to America
 DNA analysis is also a huge (and VERY recent) technology that scientists are using to find linkages between NA tribes and Asia. There are still plenty of holes in understanding the migration sadly but we are headed in the right direction with finds like these

Don't be so quick to jump to a European connection. There may be several pre-Clovis sites on the East Coast that date to before West Coast sites. But keep in mind, these sites are found through luck and great preservation. We are trying to look at a ten thousand piece puzzle with only a dozen puzzle pieces in place. All East Coast sites do is push back the date of paleoindian migration to account for these early sites, just as Monte Verde, dated to 18,000 BP, in Chile does. We need more puzzle pieces before we hitch our wagon to the Solutrean hypothesis, especially given that DNA and linguistics all point towards an Asian origin. </TEXT>

They do not. A point dredged up by a fishing boat on the east coast is the source for the Solutrean hypothesis. And even then, the point only has a passing resemblance to actual Solutrean points.

Keep in mind, you would not expect paleoindian toolsets to reflect Southeast Asian ones. Not only are you hunting different things, paleoindians spent several thousand years in Berengia before moving southward into the Americas. During those thousands of years, tool types can and probably did change from any contemporary tooltypes found in Eastern Siberia/Russia. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You would be surprised what survives in oral history. There is a section of a book titled Skull Wars by David Hurst Thomas. He talks about a 7,400 year old oral story that survived to the 1800s when an American soldier wrote it down. I'll lift the passage which starts on page 249.

*Chief Lalek begins the Klamath story like this: "A long time ago, so long that you cannot count it the white man ran wild in the woods and my people lived in rock-built houses. In that time, long ago, before the stars fell, the spirits of the earth and the sky, the spirits of the sea and the mountains, often came and talked with my people..." Lalek then described the spirits living inside Mount Mazama and its sister mountain, Mount Shasta. The two massive peaks had openings that led to a lower world through which the spirits could pass. The Chief of the Below-World loved a Klamath chief's daughter, Loha, and demanded that she marry him. When this amorous overture was rebuked, the result did not sit well with the spirit, who threatened total destruction of the people as revenge. "Raging and thundering," the story went, "he rushed up through the opening and stood on top of his mountain," terrorizing the people below.*

*At this point, the spirit of Mount Shasta intervened as a cloud appeared over the peak of Shasta, and the two mountains engaged in a horrible combat: "Red-hot rocks as large as hills hurled through the skies. Burning ashes fell like rain. The chief of the Below-World (Mazama) spewed fire from its mouth. Like an ocean of flame it devoured the forests on the mountains and in the valleys. On and on the Curse of Fire swept until it reached the homes of the people. Fleeing in terror before it, the people found refuge in the waters of Klamath Lake."*

*The Klamaths then decided that someone should be sacrificed to calm the chaos. Two medicine men climbed Mount Mazama and jumped into the caldera: "Once more the mountains shook. This time the Chief of the Below-World was driven into his home and the top of the mountain fell upon him. When the morning sun arose, the high mountain was gone... for many years, rain fell in torrents and filled the great hole that was made when the mountain fell..."*

*Chief Lalek ended his story this way: "Now you understand why my people never visit the lake. Down through the ages we have this story. From father to son has come the warning, "look not upon the place... for it means death or everlasting sorrow."*

*Deloria emphasizes the parallels between the pre-1865 Klamath account-recorded decades before the first scientist explored Crater Lake-and the modern geological explanation, which dates only to the 1920s. In both, Mount Mazama was destroyed in a catastrophic explosion, characterized by superheated avalanches, a massive cloud of volcanic dust, the dramatic collapse of the peak into the belly of the mountain, and the formation of a new deepwater lake atop the truncated mountain.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> The answer is that there may have been other settlements which used stonework, but we have not yet found these other settlements. The reason Gobekli Tepi can even be studied is that the people who built the structures purposely buried them before abandoning the site. Other contemporaneous structures within the region may not have been so fortunate. If left exposed, other people will mine the site for building material as it is easier to break up megalithic blocks for your own use than to quarry and shape new ones.

So really, it is only a matter of time and chance until we find other contemporaneous settlements to Gobekli Tepi which we hopefully illuminate our understanding of these people, much like pre-Clovis sites have done for our understanding of paleoindians and the settlement of the Americas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why did you bring Aztecs into this story? They did not build or really inhabit Teotihuacan. Teotihuacanos built and lived in Teotihuacan.

And what do you mean by picture based writing system? Do you mean pictograph? Because [this](http://www.ancientscripts.com/aztec.html) is Aztec writing and it was not written in full sentences like you would with Egyptian. Or are you thinking of the [Maya](http://www.ancientscripts.com/maya.html) writing system written with glyphs in long organized blocks? If the latter, it is a completely different culture and people than the Aztecs or Teotihuacanos. </TEXT>

What annoys me is how quick Dems are to forget or brush aside Hillary's faults and mistakes  and their party's faults and mistakes as they go after Trump. They are doing exactly what Republicans were doing to Obama and Democrats before the election. I just want one side to own up to their mistakes by acknowledging them with a vow to do better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That article discusses how the chicken remains are not Polynesian in origin, which refutes that line of evidence.

While sweet potatoes may have gone from South America to Polynesia, it does not indicate that Polynesians settled and populated the Americas. It indicates there was limited contact well after South America was settled by paleoindians via Beringia.

As for bottle gourds, like dogs, paleoindians brought the plant with them from Asia. It makes sense given that gourds make excellent containers if one doesn't have pottery. Again, not a sign of Polynesian origin of Native Americans

People have, but there is no archaeological evidence for an earlier occupation in Polynesia other than the Polynesian occupation.

You also could not have a sufficiently large enough population come from Polynesia to settle all of the Americas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know the T-shape of the teeth makes Pakal look a little like a dufus, but the T-shape has great symbolic importance in Maya belief. The T-shape can be seen on depictions of the [Sun God](http://trentu.ca/anthropology/documents/Williams-DENTALMODIFICATIONINTHEPOSTCLASSIC.pdf). Houston and Taube have identified this shape as the [*ik* sign](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pamela_Geller2/publication/306278362_Altering_Identities_Body_Modification_and_the_pre-Columbian_Maya/links/57b604c708ae19a365fc5336.pdf). The *ik* sign denotes wind, breath, and aroma which are all things related to life. The use of the T-shape/*ik* sign on the mask is a way to ensure that Pakal continued to live through a jadeite effigy even if he, as a person, passed away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am going to the annual Society for American Archaeology conference in Vancouver this week. I just realized today that I will be in Vancouver a full day before any sessions take place. I booked my flight/hotel before the program came out forgetting that Wednesdays are usually reserved for Society functions, some paid or reserved sessions, and registration. I'm a little upset because this is an extra day at the hotel + food that I could have avoided paying. So now I need to find things to do on Wednesday.

On the plus side, I am going to visit the Star Trek exhibit at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle while I wait for my train to Vancouver, BC tomorrow afternoon. So that will be cool </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's still an artificial benchmark based on your own bias and perception. That is the point I am trying to make. Native American civilizations are, like every other civilization, inherently advanced just as societies are inherently complex. There are no simple civilizations or simple societies. The degree of advancement or complexity is an artificial division created using biased categories.

<TEXT> They had advanced civilizations, though. It is just how you define advanced that either includes them or not. It's like saying complex societies. Every society no matter where you are or when is complex. There are no simple societies. Even if you create a detailed and well worded definition to differentiate complex and simple societies, the definition is an artificial construct meant to create a division. By focusing on just the presence or absence of horses and pack animals you are excluding everything else about a civilization from their art to their philosophy to their culture that would otherwise be considered advanced. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  guns are terrifying compared to bows. They make very loud noises and they fire instantly instead of needing to be drawn.

Ross Hassig writes in his book *Aztec Warfare* (1988) on page 238,

*But the Aztecs were quick students, soon observing that the noise and smoke were of no consequence and that the shot went in a straight line. Thus, when the cannons fired, the warriors would dodge to the sides, as they also did against muskets. But firearms were not the decisive factor. In fact, in the final days of the Conquest the Spaniards' gunpowder was so low that they tried to build a catapult.*

 Guns go through shields and (sometimes) armor like butter, while bows, especially native american bows, can barely scratch plate armor.

Not an arrow but, on page 79 Hassig writes,

*Spanish sources attest to the effectiveness of these weapons, asserting that darts thrown with the atlatl could pierce any armor and still inflict a fatal wound. The barbed darts were particularly dangerous, since the point had to be cut out rather then simply being pulled out.*

And page 83 he describes the effectiveness of spears,

*In one engagement, a spear pierced Diaz del Castillo's metal armor and was stopped only by the thick underpadding of cotton.* </TEXT>

<TEXT>  And of course there are the other factors that screwed the Americas over like lack of pack animals such as ox or horses. Having to travel over foot really limited the contact between cultures. 

Not quite. There are extensive trading networks in the Americas with goods traveling very far distances. To have those goods travel it requires people to move. Things like turquoise from New Mexico found in Oaxaca in exchange for cacao. Or jadeite from the mountains of Guatemala found in Jalisco. Or copper from the Great Lakes found in Louisiana. Or obsidian from Yellowstone found in Michigan. Sure, you could argue that these goods passed from hand to hand and it was no single person making these great journeys. But you could say the same for the way goods moved about the Old World, as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You ignored two other words, mate

 basically what is used to demonize Mexicans.

Who is demonizing the Aztecs? And more importantly, why? Those of us that study the past do not judge them for what they did by our own contemporary morals. The Aztecs practiced sacrifice as it was a fundamental part of their religion and belief system. To deny what the Aztecs did or to obfuscate their actions is much worse than trying to condemn the practice. You would be denying a fundamental part of who they were.

You haven't seen Hassig's book? He's the de facto authority on Aztec warfare. You kind of have to go out of your way to avoid his book while trying to study Mesoamerican warfare. I suggest tracking down a copy and reading it before trying to tell others about the subject. </TEXT>

 Meso ritual warfare was focused on capturing opponents alive 

No, it certainly did not. Aztec flower wars may have been focused on trying to capture people, but normal and typical warfare meant killing others. You see this with Teotihuacan, the Maya, the Zapotec, etc. 

 Meso style warfare resulted in lower kill counts than battlefield killing style

Whatever "Meso style warfare" is, it included battlefield warfare. You see groups fighting on open plains as often as you see the using tactics and terrain to get an advantage on the enemy (hilltop warfare, ambushes, fortresses, etc).

<TEXT> [Last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5zxqmj/friday_freeforall_march_17_2017/df1xi8y/) I said the Bristol Museum was allowing me to use photos of the Los Guachimontones site taken by Adela Breton in the 1890s for my thesis. Well, I received the high resolution scans of the photos. After taking a closer look at the pictures, and using Photoshop to clear some of it up, I think the photos are of Circle 1 and not Circle 2. It is difficult to say for sure since so few photos exist of Los Guachimontones before restoration. I don't know why, but it seems as though Phil Weigand failed to take photos of the site before he began work or he never made the photos available through publication. Identifying the mounds is even more difficult given the fact that the altar of Circle 1 is heavily covered in foliage. In Breton's photos the mounds are cover in some short grass and small trees. I'm a little disappointed that it is Circle 1 rather than Circle 2, but I'm still happy that these photos exist. I'll have to wait to see what my advisor says about them when I send him a revision of my background chapter with the photos included.

In other news, I came across some really old photos of the ruins at Ixtepete in the Guadalajara area.

http://tonala.org.mx/turismo/galeria-de-fotos/antiguas/pages/Ixtepete01_jpg.htm

http://tonala.org.mx/turismo/galeria-de-fotos/antiguas/pages/Ixtepete02_jpg.htm

I collected photos of the reconstructed ruins in [this post](http://tlatollotl.tumblr.com/post/137442937181/zona-arqueol%C3%B3gica-ixtepete-jalisco-mexico) on Tumblr. What I was actually looking for was photos of the ruins that used to be near Tonala, a suburb of Guadalajara. In the early 1990s the city illegally bulldozed the site to create a municipal dump. I've been searching on and off for some historic photos of the Guadalajara area, especially aerial photos, to see if anyone managed to take photos before it was bulldozed. As it stands, the only information we have on the site comes from Phil Weigand and a [rough site map](http://i.imgur.com/ltqOUba.png) he produced. It's a damn shame Jalisco has neglected its pre-Columbian past for so long. So if any of you know of any good sources for historic photos of Guadalajara/Jalisco, please let me know.  </TEXT>

Maybe not in the exact same form as in Europe, but feudal and republic-like systems did exist. People did have to farm a noble's land or give them a tax in the form of tribute from their own land.

Cyprus always fascinated me because it was at a crossroads in the eastern Mediterranean. There are few places where you can dig and find Greek, Hittite, Levantine, and Egyptian objects in relative abundance within one site. I am surprised that no one has tried to chemically source bronze objects from outside of Cyprus to Cyprus' copper sources. Or maybe someone has and I have not seen the publication yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Isotope studies on five remains of people from Pannonia (now Hungary) have shown that people living on the fringe of the Roman Empire were much more fluid in their lifestyle than previously believed. Instead of a sharp divide between Roman farmers and Hun herdsman, these remains show that people switched from farming to herding and back again or vice versa over the course of their lifetime. I wonder, then, if a large portion of the Huns were made up of Romans who decided to join Attila rather than side with their homeland. </TEXT>

Edit: I hope their vinyl release is something amazing. Like 11 picture discs with each song featured on their corresponding record. Maybe have big 19.7" or 16" records for The Sun and Jupiter and little 4.7" records for Mercury or Pluto. It would be great to mount the records in a big picture frame like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Planets2013.svg/1280px-Planets2013.svg.png) (plus the Moon and Pluto) for your wall.

As much as I wish this, I think producing the specialty sizes might be too much of a pain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Epiclassic in Mesoamerica. It was such a turbulent time with great city-states falling (Teotihuacan, Monte Alban, Cholula, Tikal, Calakmul) and other city-states rising from the ashes (Xochicalco, Cacaxtla, Chichen Itza, Xochimilco). It seems as though everyone was affected by the Chichimec migrations out of the Bajio. During this time people were experimenting with art, iconography, architecture, and political systems. The old ways were thrown out with cultural fusions put in their stead. It's a very exciting time </TEXT>

That is natural rock incorporated into the wall. You can clearly see sharp divisions between the blocks and the natural rock. You do not see any blocks that appear melted.

As for the Greek wall, which I am not familiar with, it appears that some of the blocks are missing from the wall and the earth/rubble fill from the interior has been exposed to the elements. This would cause the earthen fill to slowly erode. If not earthen fill, it may be concrete that was poorly poured over the area to prevent further erosion and destruction of the wall. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The blocks in Peru are not melted. They are simply shaped to remove as little stone from the block as possible which can give them more than six sides. And the exterior of the wall is not representative of the whole wall construction. The close fittedness of the blocks only extends for a few centimeters into the wall. After that, large spaces and openings form which were packed with earth and rubble.

<TEXT> **The Maya**

The Classic Maya were known to have several house forms. The type, size, and cost of a house reflect the familys status within Maya society. Palaces would obviously belong to the ruling elites or very high status elites. But what if you are not a king or a member of the kings family? Where do you live and what do you live in?

**Commoners**

The majority of Maya commoners lived in simple wattle and daub structures. The construction of a commoners house first begins with the construction of a low platform. This platform is made of stone, earth, and other debris in order to raise the superstructure above the ground. The surface of the platform is stamped down and will act as the floor of the perishable structure. Next, a stone foundation is constructed with one or two courses of stone. This foundation will allow for the construction of the wattle and daub. Next, the wattle is constructed for the walls of the house. Wattles consist of small branches and twigs that are interlaced together. Next, daub is applied to the wattle of the house. Daub consists of mud mixed with aggregate such as sand, grass, or wood chips. This aggregate helps to bind the mud and prevent it from cracking. Lastly, a roof made of thatch or grass is erected to protect the interior of the house. The roof is gabled so that the slope of the roof falls in two directions from the ridgepole. The roof extends past the wattle to form eaves on three sides of the house and a porch on the fourth.  The spaces beneath the eves and the porch allow for activities to be conducted outside of the home in the light. One of the most important activities is cooking with the kitchen located against one side of the house.

That is a basic Maya house. It would look very similar to [this modern reconstruction](http://i.imgur.com/lxGbjXE.jpg).  It is very simple and very basic. Elliot Abrams (1994) conducted an examination of residential architecture at the site of Copan in Honduras. Copan was a large Classic period Maya city with some impressive structures. In Abrams examination, he estimated the volume of the materials used to construct these residences. Using these volumes, Abrams applied rates of work taken from replicative experiments to determine how long it would take to build these structures. For a basic commoner house, the house averaged around 200 person-days. That means it would take 1 person 200 days, 200 people 1 day, or some other combination of people and days to construct the house. Abrams argues that most construction would have taken place during the dry season, but the full dry season could not be spent building a home as other activities needed to be done (warfare, planting next seasons crops, etc). He argues that half the dry season would be normal for construction. In Copans case, that would be 60 days. That means if someone wanted to build a house requiring 200 person-days in 60 days, they would need 4 people to help out. Trying to recruit just 4 people for construction would not be difficult if one relies on their kin relations.

**Higher class**

Obviously not everyone lived in such a simple house and there are other house forms at Copan that are somewhere in between a palace and wattle and daub structure. At Copan, Abrams examined houses which he dubbed improved architectural form to set them apart from the basic architectural form of a wattle and daub structure. The characteristics that set them apart from the basic form include a longer and taller platform substructure which eliminated the porch, greater use of stone in construction fill for the substructure platform, the use of dressed masonry blocks for retaining walls backed by masonry and mortar for the substructure platform, the superstructure foundation made of masonry blocks, internal room size variations within the house , a beam and mortar roof or a vaulted roof using a corbelled arch, the construction of benches along the interior walls of the house, external sculptural decorations, and the use of a thick layer of limestone plaster to protect the house and substructure platform from the elements.  These stone built houses could be found in clusters around courtyards at Copan.

For comparison, this is a stone house at the site of [Coba]( http://i.imgur.com/dNkTNys.jpg) further north in the Yucatan peninsula. Or this [sketch](http://i.imgur.com/7SZWTgB.png) of a stone house from Copan (Fash 1989). These houses use a significantly larger amount of labor than the basic wattle and daub structure. The average amount of person-days needed to construct these houses was almost 4,000 person-days. That means if you wanted to build a house in a single dry season you would need 67 people working on your house for 60 days straight. Obviously, these houses could be built in stages. Perhaps one year the substructure platform was built, in the second year, the walls were erected. And in the last year the roof was constructed and the whole thing was covered in plaster.  Even so, you would need 23 people a year to help build your house. In these cases, these houses were most likely used by higher status individuals rather than everyday commoners. These people were most likely minor nobles rather than any sort of middle class we may have today. 

**Maya cities**

So what did Maya cities look like? Well, its not easy to reconstruct. Archaeological work is painstakingly slow and expensive. Depending on the research interests of the archaeologist, they may use what limited grant money they have to target specific areas they hope will yield fruitful data to answer their research question. That means many houses go unexcavated and are allowed to be consumed by the jungle vegetation. This makes it difficult to imagine what the landscape may have looked like with all those houses. Fortunately, the cost of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) has allowed archaeologists to make use of this system to map huge areas. What they have found, is that the landscape can be much more dense than we previously beleved. The Chases have shown that the area around [Caracol](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/R_Shrestha/publication/222667926_Airborne_LiDAR_archaeology_and_the_ancient_Maya_landscape_at_Caracol_Belize/links/5449187d0cf2f6388080d4e9.pdf) is much more heavily terraced than previously believed with formerly unknown sacbe (raised roads, white in color) linking the ceremonial center with other secondary centers. Another project focusing on the Postclassic city of [Mayapan]( http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/6/9/9064) has shown that the urban sprawl of the city [extended well beyond the city walls]( http://www.mdpi.com/remotesensing/remotesensing-06-09064/article_deploy/html/images/remotesensing-06-09064f12-1024.png). Those bumps in the landscape are the buried remains of buildings that create bumps in the landscape. These buildings would have been clustered into neighborhoods and barrios around courtyards, plazas, and smaller temples dedicated to a variety of different gods.

**Commercial buildings**

For the Classic Maya, there is an ongoing debate as to whether markets existed in cities. They, for sure, existed in the Postclassic but the Postclassic had designated areas for markets to be held. Classic period cities do not always show that same sort of planning. If you are interested, I did answer a previous topic on Maya markets [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/498w0h/suppose_youre_in_a_mayan_city_in_ad50_will_you/d0r6ria/).

<TEXT>  Cavalry, though, that was a game-changer in the Americas.

Not always. Remember, the Spanish did not conquer Mesoamerica by themselves. They had Native allies to do most of the fighting for them. According to Hassig (1988), cavalry only gave a slight advantage. On page 237 he writes,

*It is true that cannons, guns, crossbows, steel blades, horses, and war dogs were advances on the Aztecs' weaponry. But the advantage these gave a few hundred Spanish soldiers was not overwhelming. In any case, individual Aztec warriors were shown to be the equal of any Spanish soldier, and the Aztecs in general proved remarkably adaptable. Individual warriors are reported as having grabbed the horseman's lances and thereby neutralized them. One conquistador recorded a case in which a warrior successfully defended himself against three or four Spanish horsemen. When they could not bring him down, one of the Spaniards threw his lance at the Indian, who caught it and fought for another hour before being shot by two archers and then stabbed.*

And then Hassig continues on page 238 and 241,

*Another factor favoring the Spaniards was their use of cavalry and mounted lancers. Before the Conquest, as noted earlier, the Aztecs used an open formation in their battle stance, since the denser closed formation is basically a tactic used to repel massed mounted attacks and was thus unknown to them. But open formations were ineffectual against cavalry charges. Nevertheless, the Aztecs quickly adopted strategies aimed at minimizing the effectiveness of the horse, but a major shift in tactics would have required considerable time, since it would involved retraining professional warriors. Closed formations were not adopted, apparently because while they might have cured the problem of a massed cavalry attack, they would have created a better target for Spanish gunners. Consequently, organizational changes played only a minor role in the Aztecs' adaptation to the Spanish challenge; ineffective tactics were abandoned, but new ones were not adopted. Instead, the response was largely technological. Devices and practices were adopted that aimed directly at these novel threats.*

*The Aztecs initially met the Spaniards in set-piece battles in open areas amid fields of maize and maguey. While the Indians often held their own and more, open fields allowed the Spaniards to take the fullest possible advantage of their horses and guns. Hence the Indians increasingly adopted countertactics aimed at minimizing the advantages of horses. For instance, when the Aztecs fell back in battle, they did so to areas, such as towns and ravines, where the Spanish cavalry could not be used to advantage. Once repositioned, the Aztec warriors turned and reformed firm lines to continue the battle.*

*Most of the advantages were not with the offensive, however, and the Aztecs were quick to use defensive measures. Passive traps were frequently built. Pits containing sharpened stakes were constructed in the streets of cities and covered with wood and earth so that they would not be readily detected. Hidden pits were dug in the water-filled canals to trap the Spaniards, and sharpened stakes were driven into the shallow lake bottom to impale horses. The dike system in the basin of Mexico was selectively destroyed in an effort to drown the enemy in low-lying areas.*

*Most of the innovative tactics adopted were static, however; the Spaniards had to be drawn into an appropriate position or maneuver. Thus, feints were used against the Spaniards, as they had been in traditional Mesoamerican warfare, and they were adopted to the circumstances of the day. During the siege of Tenochtitlan, for example, the Aztecs lured the Spaniards into positions on the causeways where they were open to attack from canoes. The Aztecs subjected the attacking Spaniards to coordinated assaults by land and water, warriors were often firing from armored canoes (chimalacalli) that were impervious to gunfire.*

*Moreover, the circumstances of the Conquest led to night actions by the Aztecs, despite their previous rarity. Night was a time of harassment during which the Aztecs yelled, whistled, and subjected the Spaniards to showers of arrows, darts, and stones from both land and canoes. But these attacks proved to be neither very committed nor sustained, although they had a significant psychological impact.*

The Mixton War was an uprising by Native groups in the Jalisco region against the Spanish and their atrocities. These groups were initially successful in driving the Spanish out of the immediate area. This may be because the Spanish were unable or unwilling to learn the differences in the numerous cultures and languages which allowed Native agents to freely operate in the open and organize their rebellion against Spanish rule. Unfortunately, the Spanish were able to recruit a force of tens of thousands of Aztec and Tarascan allies which they used to storm the fortified hilltop fortresses of the rebels. Once the main fortresses were conquered the back of the rebellion was broken. Other groups held out for as long as they could, but either retreated into the mountains or were subdued. Some groups like the Cora were able to resist Spanish rule in Nayarit until 1721 when a combination of disease and drought forced the Cora to surrender. Other groups joined up with Chichimec groups to fight in the Chichimeca War of 1550 to 1590. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A similar political model of multiple elites ruling a city/region has been proposed for [Teotihuacan](https://www2.lawrence.edu/fast/PEREGRIP/Publications/dual_processual.pdf) and for the [Teuchitlan culture](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285947727_Corporate_Power_strategies_in_the_late_fromative_to_early_classic_tequila_valleys_of_central_jalisco) (not as widely known). I honestly know very little about Tlaxcala, so it came as a surprise that they may have used this model and that it was recorded in early colonial documents. The author of the Science article wrote another piece for [Archaeology.org](http://www.archaeology.org/issues/249-1703/features/5300-olmec-tres-zapotes-government). In this piece, Christopher Pool has suggested that Tres Zapotes, an Olmec center, adopted the collective governing model which allowed them to continue into the Late Formative while La Venta and San Lorenzo were abandoned. This, too, was also new to me.

So there is some precedence to the model. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As an addendum to /u/A_Sporific's fantastic response, you may be interested in the section [The Maya](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/mesoamerica#wiki_the_maya) in our FAQ which contains several previous topics on the Maya Classic period collapse.

I want to also add that there is a disproportionate amount of scholarship on the Classic period. Both the public and academia are fascinated with the idea of lost jungle cities and mysterious collapses. Because of academic focus on the Classic period both the Preclassic and Postclassic periods have suffered from a lack of equivalent attention. This gives a skewed perception that the Classic period was somehow more populated, prosperous, and important than the preceding or succeeding periods. I've provided below several sources that you may want to consider reading if you would like to further explore the topic of the Postclassic Maya.

<TEXT> The Bristol Museum has graciously allowed me to use from their collection three photos and two site maps of Los Guachimontones produced by Adela Breton in the 1890s for my thesis free of charge. While I cannot share with you all the high resolution copies, I can share links to their site that do show lower resolution versions of the photos and site maps.

The photos appear to be the central altar for Circle 2, which is the [prettiest](http://i.imgur.com/d69q8K8.jpg) of the guachimontones restored at the site. While Circle 1 is much larger than Circle 2, it also suffered more damage from modern farming. Only half of it's 12 platforms could be resorted. The altar was also badly damaged from looters. Some of the damage was filled in by restoration efforts, but the huge looters pit presented an opportunity to create a stable path to the top of the altar without damaging the rest of the structure. So if you search on Google for guachimontones and see something like [this](http://www.destination360.com/north-america/mexico/images/s/guachimontones.jpg), it was taken from the top of Circle 1's altar looking towards Circle 2.

This is one of the site maps,
 
http://museums.bristol.gov.uk/details.php?irn=229150
 
This is the other site map,
 
http://museums.bristol.gov.uk/details.php?irn=229149

What I find amusing about Breton's site maps are the number of platforms she draws. For Circles 1, 2, and 3 she drew 8 platforms. She did say in a letter to a colleague that the maps were quick sketches, so I won't fault her too much. But only Circle 3 has 8 platforms. Circle 2 has 10 platforms and Circle 1 has 12 platforms.

Including these photos and site maps won't impact my thesis too much. I want to include them so they get published somewhere, so that people can see their condition before restoration (few photos exist unfortunately), and so that Breton can get recognition for identifying these structures so early. I wish she had published them at the time so more people could have investigated the region earlier, but what are you going to do? I don't want to take away from Phil Weigand's work on these structures and this area. Without him we would be nowhere and there is no argument on that. And he really is the first person to identify the structures and publish on them despite criticism from colleagues at the time. But recognition for Breton is still deserved.

Anyway, just wanted to share and I hope you all enjoy looking at old photos of archaeology sites as much as I do.

Edit:

Yay! I received an email today on the timeline for an edited volume on architectural energetics I am making a contribution to. My chapter draft needs to be submitted by September 1st. If things go smoothly, the entire volume will be sent out for external and publisher review next March with publication presumably sometime after that. Whoo! </TEXT>

She interviewed Christopher Pool, one of the current leading experts on the Olmec, who excavated Tres Zapotes and proposed the collective governance model for the site. I thought this was a really great article. It highlights the differences within the Olmec culture instead of lumping all three major centers into one broad category.

If anyone bothered to read the creation story, they would know that with humans the gods finally got their creations correct and there was no need to try again. And if anyone bothered to track down references to the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun, not only would they discover that only two inscriptions have ever been recovered that reference this period (and the context does not include any sort of destruction), but that the Maya extrapolated dates set even further in the future than the 13th b'ak'tun for anniversaries of events like a king's birth or death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was not the point of this article at all. Did you read it? It was about testing hypotheses regarding different forms of political systems in Mesoamerica other than a centralized authoritative king. Perhaps you should read [Blanton et al's 1996](https://www2.lawrence.edu/fast/PEREGRIP/Publications/dual_processual.pdf) article and then revisit the Science article. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The grid system is a whole different argument for Teotihuacan. I know it is mentioned in the Science article, but I wouldn't consider it a feature of collective societies either. It certainly does not hold true for the Teuchitlan culture that I study. For Teotihuacan, one of the hypotheses I have heard to explain the grid was the rapid expansion of the city to accommodate displaced people when a volcano erupted. People at places like Cuicuilco and further into Puebla may have fled north to Teotihuacan. It might explain why Old Teotihuacan went from somewhat haphazard to the Teotihuacan we know today which is organized in a grid. But that's just one hypothesis </TEXT>

Some of them, like Plazuelas, may have had connections to the shaft tomb peoples further west in Nayarit, Jalisco, and Colima. Just to the east of the main complex at Plazuelas there is this structure ( 20.406033 -101.821097) which is somewhat reminiscent of sites like Los Guachimontones even though individual platforms cannot be identified. La Gloria ( 20.832471 -101.712931) to the north has more identifiable platforms, but does not seem to be as large/well made. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The only form of Native American record keeping in familiar with are the quipu knots.

The Maya, Zapotec, and Epi-Olmec have hieroglyphic writing. The Aztecs, Teotihuacan, and Mixtecs had pictographic writing.

 I'm genuinely curious, but after having had worked with archaeologists, I have serious doubts as to the validity of their findings. I've found that archaeology is mostly about using your imagination.

It sounds like you may have had a bad experience with a not so great archaeologist. I'm sorry if that is the case.

But to answer your question

And how exactly do archaeologists just dig that up? Did they dig up ancient texts?

It's not so much about digging up something that says "We were ruled by a collection of elites instead of a single king". It is about the available evidence and the context of that evidence. The lack of opulent palaces, images of identifiable elites, the distribution of wealth, and the form of architecture and its location are all lines of evidence that point to a political system that does not involve a king. For Tlaxcala, it was the multiple plazas, the possible meeting building for their elites outside of the city, the lack of imagery for a king, and lack of identifiable elite goods in the archaeological record that help to support early colonial accounts of the Tlaxcala political system.

I recommend reading [Blanton et al's article](https://www2.lawrence.edu/fast/PEREGRIP/Publications/dual_processual.pdf) on the topic and then rereading the Science article, as well as [this article](http://www.archaeology.org/issues/249-1703/features/5300-olmec-tres-zapotes-government) posted the other day by Wade, with that understanding in mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The plane in the air could be a B-26 Marauder, which is a twin engine bomber. The curve of the trailing edge in the still/movie appears to match that of the Marauder. I say could because the nacelle of the engine for the Marauder extends past the trailing edge. In the still/movie, the nacelle appears not to do that. However, the plane that is on the runway at the airport appears to be a DC-3. The DC-3, and its military counterpart the C-47, was used during World War II as a troop transport, cargo plane, and for dropping paratroopers into Normandy not as a bomber. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Despite what the title says, the article does clarify that the societies discussed in Mesoamerica are not democratic in the same way modern democracies are. Instead, these societies are ruled collectively by elites rather than a single autocratic ruler we normally envision in past societies. This article ties into a recent article over at Archaeology.org called [Kings of Cooperation](http://www.archaeology.org/issues/249-1703/features/5300-olmec-tres-zapotes-government) which discusses Olmec collective rule at the site of Tres Zapotes. This was mentioned in brief by the Science article. Blanton's work is somewhat profound for Mesoamerican studies and has changed the way we view past societies. His work has certainly influenced my own region in Mesoamerica with my advisor, Christopher Beekman, proposing a model for [cooperating lineages in the Teuchitlan culture](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285947727_Corporate_Power_strategies_in_the_late_fromative_to_early_classic_tequila_valleys_of_central_jalisco) which I am exploring in my thesis through an examination of their ceremonial architecture. As the Science article points out, we are still trying to test this model for collective governance. I am glad to see Blanton's ideas being applied to other regions of Mesoamerica which do not quite line up with our stereotypical view of past societies. I hope this generates a lot of discussion, both within and outside of academia.

[Blanton et al's 1996 article](https://www2.lawrence.edu/fast/PEREGRIP/Publications/dual_processual.pdf) for those that are interested. </TEXT>

Just make sure that when you go to college you talk to people in your classes, especially in classes for your major. One of my best friends today I met in my archaeology classes because we were both the biggest Mesoamerican nerds around. At the same time, make sure to go to parties when you can. If you have to ask where parties are being held, do so. People should be more than willing to point you to a house party, even if it is a party to promote their frat/sorority.

Making friends is weird, man. You can't stop trying, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. When the Spanish showed up the Aztecs were on their way to subduing Tlaxcala. With Tlaxcala out of the picture, the Aztecs could have better consolidated their territory and tributary provinces. If the Spanish were temporarily repulsed the Aztecs could have prepared and strengthened their position against further Spanish incursion. It did not take long for the Aztecs to adapt to fighting horses or guns/cannons. Spears were lengthened and warriors would zig zag in the field to avoid the already poor accuracy of the Spanish arquebus.

I think you severely underestimate what Mesoamericans could do. Take the Mixton War, for instance. If the Spanish had not thrown tens of thousands of Aztec and Tarascan allies at the Caxcanes and their allies, the Spanish would not have been able to break the rebellion. </TEXT>

* Writing

Writing is a big thing people talk about, but don't quite understand when it comes to Mesoamerica. The only writing associated with the Olmec comes from the Cascajal Block. This is a block of stone that is associated with the Olmec and covered wit [signs](http://www.famsi.org/mayawriting/cascajal/cascajal_drawing.jpg), though the signs are not made in any particular order. Some scholars have argued that this is a form of pictographic writing in which signs are used to recall memorized knowledge. But to date, no one has been able to translate it.

Epi-Olmec (or Isthmian) should not be confused with the Olmec. This is a later culture than the Olmec who did produce [writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:La_Mojarra_Inscription_and_Long_Count_date.jpg), though there is a debate whether we can translate it or not. Epi-Olmec is organized using a familiar system of glyphs in columns and rows like Maya writing. The Zapotecs in Oaxaca also produced a glyph based [writing system](http://blogs.uoregon.edu/mesoinstitute/files/2013/12/DSCF8526-2a7la1b.jpg). I'm not sure on its status of translation, to be honest.

Maya writing is a syllabic based writing in which [phonetic signs are combined to forms glyphs](http://www.jaguarstones.com/maya/images/glyphs/Younger%20brother.png). These glyphs represent words like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. Within the glyphs are also grammatical elements like possession, tense, direction, etc. Maya writing goes as far back as the Late Formative murals at San Bartolo, but Late Formative Maya writing hasn't been translated yet. It seems like Late Formative writing is a bit different from its later Classic form. Classic Maya and Postclassic Maya writing has been translated. This was thanks to, ironically, Friar Diego de Landa who burned hundreds of Maya manuscripts in the early colonial period. De Landa seems to have had some major remorse and did what he could to preserve what little knowledge about Maya writing that was available to him. While he was able to record phonetic signs for parts of words, he never did figure out how to combine them into glyphs. He was working under the assumption that the writing was an alphabet in which each glyph was a letter. It took centuries before Yuri Knorozov, a Soviet scientist, was able to make the first translations of Maya writing.

The Aztecs made use of a pictographic system of writing in which signs were used to recall already memorized information. These signs were incorporated in their artwork in order to relay information. Sometimes this was really straightforward with tributary lists showing a drawing of an item and a number. Other times the signs were used to convey more complex information such as the Aztec migration myth from their homeland to the Basin of Mexico. In both cases, Aztec writing differed greatly from the Maya, Zapotec, or Epi-Olmec. Their writing was not phonetic symbols combined to form words and was not organized into neat columns or rows.

So this post is getting really long and I'm going to cut it off there. I tried to cover a lot of general information without getting too specific. Let me know if you have any other questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some major differences between the Olmec, Aztec, and Maya would be:

* Ceremonial centers

While the Olmec had ceremonial centers are places like La Ventana, San Lorenzo, and Tres Zapotes, these were strictly ceremonial centers. The architecture constructed here was largely temple structures. You do not see the same level of urban structures like you would in a Maya or Aztec city which would have palaces for elites and numerous houses and storage buildings for merchants and commoners.

* Farming

The Olmec occupied floodplain areas in Veracruz. Earlier in the Archaic period, the Olmec took advantage of the fertility of the floodplain and farmed this area. As an insurance against too much flooding, they also farmed nearby hills and created low mounds that would have risen above the flood waters. While the hills provided security in arable land, they sometimes lacked sufficient water or the ability to grow diverse crops. This practice continued into the Formative period.

The Maya farmed using a couple of methods. The more famous method was to create milpas or fields in the jungle which they would use for a few years while rotating crops and then leave fallow to recover. Another method was to create terraces to prevent erosion and provide more arable land. The area around Caracol is heavily terraced.

The Aztecs were known for their chinampa system. A chinampa is a raised bed of earth located in a lake. The Aztecs would drive stakes into the lake bottom for support and then add layers of reed mats and earth until the mound was stable and ready for farming. They would then plant their crops on these raised beds while using the lake water for irrigation. I've heard that they would also plant some tree species along the edge of the chinampa for support. Supposedly a chinampa could get two or three crops a year compared to normal farming.

* Deities

Deities between the Olmec, Maya, and Aztec are not as similar as you may think. Some kind of feathered serpent deity or figure was shared among them, but you would be hard pressed to say that it was the exact same deity. Olmec deities are somewhat harder to discuss since they left no writing and their cultural practices had changed or were replaced by the time the Spanish arrived. For the Maya we can look to their own writing and colonial writings to piece together their mythology and beliefs. For the Maya they have deities like the maize god (sometimes called Hun-Hunahpu), Ah Muzen Cab (god of bees), Ah Puch (god of death), and Kinich Ahau (solar deity). The Aztecs may have similar gods that occupy similar positions of belief like Centeotl (god of maize), subject6396 (lord of the underworld), and Tonatiuh (sun god), but the beliefs and mythology surrounding Aztec gods are completely different from their Maya counterparts. That does not mean that certain concepts were not shared such as the four directions of the world, a concept for the heavens and underworld, and an axis mundi (sometimes associated with a tree) that linked the underworld to the earthly plane and on to the heavens.

* Politics

It is hard to pin down Olmec politics. As I mentioned above, they left no writing behind and their culture in the Formative period did not remain static enough until the arrival of the Spanish. The Olmec most likely had rulers who may have been equal parts priest, king, and warrior. However, burials for Olmec elites have not really been recovered. The environment of Veracruz does not lend itself well to preservation unless you are deeply buried in swamp muck like the wooden busts found at El Manat. Scholars have argued for decades as to what the political system of the Olmec may have been. Some link the Olmec to an empire that spread out from Veracruz and reached places like Guerrero, the Basin of Mexico, and the Maya region. They base this idea on similar looking artwork which has not quite held up to critique. Where one scholar sees an empire expanding its influence via artwork, another scholar sees local elites adopting aspects of Olmec culture and art for their own purposes to gain power and prestige. Recent dating of the cave art at Oxtotitlan in Guerrero puts the artwork as contemporary or even earlier than the Olmec. This may throw another wrench into the idea that the Olmec were very influential. Likewise with more work in the Maya region uncovering Early and Middle Formative sites that are contemporaneous, yet clearly different artistically from the Olmec.

Starting with the earliest urban centers in places like Ceibal in the Middle Formative period, the Maya appear to have always seem to have occupied city-states in which they shared an overarching culture and language family. At no point has the Maya region ever been unified in any sort of empire, though large alliances did occur. Some recent work at Classic period sites have lead some scholars to argue that Calakmul did, in fact, form an empire and then crushed their rival, Tikal. However, this hypothesis is still very new and very fresh and must run through the academic gauntlet as people support or contest the idea and as more evidence is uncovered. The Maya continued to occupy city-states through the Classic period and into the Postclassic and colonial periods. Many people have heard of the Classic period collapse, but collapse is not quite the correct word. Things definitely changed for the Maya in the last few centuries of the Classic period, but it was not some apocalyptic event in which hundreds of thousands of people died and the survivors huddled in their huts for centuries until the Spanish showed up. Instead, the collapse was more complex. There was a restructuring of politics in which the former Classic period god-king, both spiritual and political ruler of the city who could communicate with the gods, was replaced with a more secular king, council, and priestly order. Now, not every Postclassic city may have followed this, but they definitely did not hold the same religiously backed political influence they once had. The percept that the Postclassic was somehow less or trivial compared to the Classic is, in part, the result of academic research during the past century+. People, including academics, were enamored by the idea of a lost jungle cities and the idea of this collapse. As a result, there is a disproportionate amount of research conducted on the Classic period which gives a skewed view of how we view the past. People see that we know less about the Postclassic, combine that with the idea of a collapse, and conclude that the Maya really did meet some apocalyptic end. The reality is that some urban centers were abandoned in the last few centuries of the Classic period, more warfare did occur, famine and drought did occur, but these events were haphazard and not continuous throughout the area. For every urban center that was abandoned, you see an increase in population in another center or the reoccupation of an Early Classic classic center. For every sign of warfare you see an extensive trade network of goods from much further away than before. For every instance of evidence of drought and famine, we find evidence of prosperity and abundance. That is why we see large centers like Chichen Itza, Coba, Mayapan, Q'umarkaj, and Uxmal form. That's why we see places like Nojpeten not only continue, but thrive and resist the Spanish until 1697. The fractured nature of the Maya region allowed them to continue on when disaster hit an area. They were quite resilient

The Aztecs, unlike the Maya, are categorized as an empire. The Aztecs were really an alliance of three city-states in the Basin of Mexico. The most famous one is Tenochtitlan, the city for the Mexica, but there is also Tlacopan and Texcoco. These three city-states banded together to overthrow the Tepanecs and eventually went on to conquer the entire Basin of Mexico and onward. The Aztecs were not quite a territorial empire. They would go to a city and demand that a city give them tribute. If the city refused each envoy from the Triple Alliance, the Aztecs would then raise their armies, conquer the city, replace their leader, and demand a heftier tribute. Those that surrendered were able to keep their rulers and their men did not have to die in battle. Needless to say, many groups tried to rebel against the Aztecs though none were able to coordinate together well enough to completely throw off the Aztec yoke. Groups like the Tlaxcallans may have been on their way to being subdued by the Aztecs if they had not allied themselves with the Spanish. Others, like the Tarascans, the Aztecs were not able to conquer and instead constructed a series of defensive fortresses. The Aztecs may have been trying to strangle the Tarascans economically as they were with the Tlaxcallans, but those plans were never able to come to fruition. </TEXT>

 There were, however, a number of notable examples of white colonial administrators known for particular sadism. These included individuals such as Lon Rom, Lon Fivez (known as the "devil of quateur"), and Ren de Permentier who collectively served as inspirations for the character of Kurtz in Joseph Conrad's 1899 novella Heart of Darkness

And to bring in [another source](http://www.digitaljournal.com/blog/11297)

 Severed hands

 Such was the brutality of Leopolds Congo that those who failed to meet the rubber quotas set by the Belgian officers, were routinely flogged with the chicote or had their hands severed (the chicotte was a whip made out of raw, sun-dried hippopotamus hide, cut into a long sharp-edged cork-screw strip. It was applied to bare buttocks, and left permanent scars. Twenty strokes of it sent victims into unconsciousness and a 100 or more strokes were often fatal. The chicotte was freely used by both Leopold's men and the French).

 Leopold used a private mercenary force, Force Publique (FP), to do his terrorising and killing. White Officers commanded black soldiers many of whom were cannibals from tribes in the upper Congo and others had been kidnapped as children during raids on surrounding villages and raised in missionaries.
A FP junior officer described a raid to punish a village that had protested, in the following words. The commanding officer ordered us to cut off the heads of the men and hang them on the village palisades, also their sexual members, and to hang the women and the children on the palisade in the form of a cross."

This also doesn't change that fact that people were being brutalized </TEXT>

<TEXT> The article is working under the assumptions that all Native Americans were hunter-gatherers and that modern hunter-gatherers who live in marginal areas are representative of all hunter-gatherers regardless of the environment they live in. These assumptions would, of course, produce smaller estimates. However, we know that not all Native Americans were hunter-gatherers. Most of them were agriculturalists who may have supplemented their farming with hunting as early European colonists did. We also know that modern hunter-gatherers are not representative of hunter-gatherers in the past since the marginal areas they currently live does not have the same carrying capacity as more fertile areas non-hunter-gatherers currently occupy. These marginal areas restric population numbers since overpopulation would lead to catastrophe. That's why you have higher population estimates by both Dobyns and Thornton who factor these things into their estimates. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is just one hypothesized population estimate. Thornton (1990) estimates 7 million people and Dobyns (1983) estimates 18 million people. Part of the difficulty in estimating populations is that European diseases often raced ahead of Europeans entering an area and then recording the population.

 The white slaves would become known as "Rednecks", a name that is still around today, because their fair skin would burn while the toiled in the sun all day.

[Etymology Online](
http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0 search=redneck) makes no mention of white slaves in relation to this term.

 I take it you mean Europeans specifically living on the North American continent?

No, I mean Europeans everywhere. Europe itself would not have grown in population as it did after 1492 without using New World plants. Just look at the history of the potato.  </TEXT>

 All of the infrastructure, buildings, scientific advancements, etc. are (for the most part) European.

Not all. Europeans would be nowhere without New World plants. They would not have seen a population explosion after the 1500s if it were not for maize and potatoes not to mention other fruits and vegetables like tomatoes, tomatillos, beans, squash, chiles, pineapple, cacao, vanilla, avocado, quinoa, amaranth, etc. European countries would not have been able to become wealthy or even send colonists to areas like Virginia and the Carolinas without exploiting cash crops like tobacco and cotton, either. These plants required careful cultivation and ingenuity over thousands of years, especially maize.  </TEXT>

Also a common misconception. Natives heavily modified their landscape for their own purposes. The Amazon jungle, for instance, is one giant orchard along its many rivers. Natives purposely planted and cultivated trees to provide for themselves a secure food source throughout the year to supplement any farming or hunting they did.

The Moche and Hohokam both created extensive irrigation systems in their respective arid regions of the Americas to bring water for farming and drinking. 

The Inca heavily terraced their mountain and hillsides to provide farmable land to support their empire of millions.

The Aztecs created a system of damns in Lake Texcoco to separate the salt and fresh waters of the lake. This allowed them to create a source of fresh water for drinking and farming while being able to continue to exploit salt and freshwater plants and animals.

 I would be more than happy to discuss them having their own land in America.

They had their own land. Two continents worth until 1492. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The current Native Americans were just the last group that migrated to the new world via Asia. they genocided and enslaved the previous wave,just as the previous did to the ones before them. the native Americas were not originally there, they conquered it just as the settlers did, they just arrived slightly earlier.

There's no evidence for this. Archaeologists have proposed multiple waves of migration to explain genetic and linguistic dissimilarities between Native populations, but these hypotheses do not propose any kind of genocide of the previous wave of migration. </TEXT>

You haven't though because you assume everyone lives in a hut. Or that they farmed the same way or the same things. You are relying on this perception that all Native peoples are somehow Plains peoples when that is completely false.

 But if I said, as a historian from the future, that vehicles in the 20th century U.S. were still on the combustion engine era, telling me that I'm painfully generalizing a huge region and I could find such rich variation from the Tin Lizzie to the Grand Caravan, that wouldn't mean that automobile technology had advanced beyond the combustion engine.

You both are assuming that there is an end goal that every culture/civilization is somehow working towards. History isn't a game of civilization. People are not working towards building a ship to go to Alpha Centauri. There's no real answer to this question because the question itself is flawed. It requires a definition of what "advanced" means and that definition invariably is set up for most non-Europeans to fail that test. You talk about "advanced", but you only consider some technological developments. No one ever stops to think of cultural, social, linguistic, artistic, etc developments. You see the issue in trying to answer that question? You could have some advanced technology, but totally be devoid of a dynamic and artistic culture. Or your language may be set up in such a way to inadequately express certain ideas or concepts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I'm saying is that European agricultural practices are not as effective for all other agricultural practices. Case in point, the potato. Europeans planted the potato as they would any other crop. This made the potato susceptible to temperature change and the spread of fungus from guano-based fertilizer. If Europeans had planted the potato as Andeans did, at the bottom of troughs of earth widely separated from one another, the potato famines experienced by Europeans would not have been as severe with the fungus unable to easily transmit to other plants and the plants protected by frosts or temperatures that were too hot.

So you are assuming that using a horse in conjunction with maize, chiles, beans, squash, cacao, vanilla, goosefoot, yucca, quinoa, potatoes, tomatoes, tomatillos, pineapple, etc would somehow magically increase their effectiveness even though these foods were domesticated and cultivated without the use of a horse for thousands of years.

Populations estimates are difficult to calculate, thus the large spread.

Why? The Americas were able to support 50 million to 100 million people by 1492. Trade networks stretched up and down the coasts and  in the interior (i.e. copper from the Great Lakes found in Louisiana, turquoise from New Mexico found in southern Mexico, tomatoes from South America found in Mexico).

  If you wanted to build something huge, it was a major, time-consuming undertaking that required a lot of human labour. If you wanted to move very large amounts of anything, you either used a boat or a lot of people, or didn't bother.

While this is true, large constructions were still made without the use of any sort of pack animal to move the construction material. Native Americans were perfectly able make some of the largest constructions in the world. The Great Pyramid of Cholula, for example, is almost twice the volume of the Pyramid at Giza and it was constructed using only human laborers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How do you encounter these theories in grad school for archaeology? Is it zany fellow students? Is Clyde Winters one of the graduate advisors at your school?

I should rephrase my sentence. I don't encounter these people in graduate school and none of my professors have expressed support for these kinds of ideas. I have encountered people that do support fringe ideas. One person was in an undergraduate course on Greek archaeology while I was earning my BA who did ask about Atlantis. While in graduate school I met another person at a bar outside of class who was talking about ley lines under the Egyptian pyramids. Most of the people I have encountered that support the idea for pre-Columbian trans-Atlantic contact have been through social media because of the Tumblr and Instagram accounts I manage on the side. These accounts are dedicated mostly to Mesoamerican archaeology and New World archaeology more broadly to get people interested and wanting to learn about the history, people, and culture of the Americas. This inevitably butted heads with people pushing other ideas.

I should have said that as a graduate student in Mesoamerican archaeology, this study concerns me because of its possible implications by people who support these fringe ideas on social media. Many of the accounts that push these ideas have many more followers than I do and can thus reach a far larger audience than I. It is difficult by myself to gauge the real world impact of how these ideas are embraced and spread by others. When people argue over these ideas, it can become nasty with people making personal attacks against the other. Most of the arguments I have seen are between Native and Latino users defending their history, culture, and heritage from those wishing to take it away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is more of a race and politics question, but relates to your work.

How can you prevent pseudo-scientific writers, such as Clyde Winters, from using your study to bolster their narrative for pre-Columbian trans-Atlantic contact between groups like the Olmec of Mexico and various West African groups? 

With paywalls in place for many peer-reviewed journals, the expensive cost for academic level book publications, the lack of academic level book publications in book stores, and the easy access to internet websites that feature and promote pseudo-scientific writings, it seems like more and more people are believing these fringe ideas that ancient Egyptians or West African groups sailed to the Americas to give civilization to Native Americans. Another popular fringe idea is that Native Americans were actually black/African in appearance before white Europeans enslaved them rather than importing people from Africa and/or more recent Asian migrants killed the rest and then somehow became the Native Americans we all know today.

If it sounds convoluted, it is. Yet people on social media repeatedly express their support for these beliefs at the detriment of real Native American people losing their history, culture, and identity. Despite the overwhelming genetic, linguistic, and archaeological evidence that disproves these pseudo-scientific ideas, people ignore the evidence and pick and choose studies to support their beliefs. By arguing that facial structure has a genetic component, those that believe these pseudo-scientific narratives will most likely try and use your study to revisit topics such as the appearance of the Olmec colossal heads. They can and most likely will justify their beliefs by using these heads, saying they look African in appearance even though the colossal heads are artistic expressions of people set in stone and not an actual person's head, and citing your study to back their beliefs.

This is not an easy question to answer and I understand if you don't want to try and answer it. I only ask because this is something I encounter as a graduate student in Mesoamerican archaeology. People's identity and feelings can be very much wrapped in an ethnic or racial origin and having people undermine that identity causes conflict and strife for both parties. Historically, phenotype classifications have led to a lot of awful events and not just for slavery in the U.S. We can look at a much more recent event in the Rwandan genocide in which Tutsi and Hutu were killed because of nose shape and neck shape. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As an archaeology graduate student becoming involved in academia, the criticism and attacks on other researchers is all too real. I did not know the story behind Cinq-Mars and the Bluefish Caves until now, but I was familiar with Dillehay's story with Monte Verde. This kind of controversy is very real and very alive today in anthropology and not just for pre-Clovis archaeology. The attacks and criticisms of the Rising Star Cave is one such example. Another example is Phil Weigand's rediscovery of guachimontones in Jalisco, the region that I currently study. I'm not saying that we should be skeptical and even critical at times regarding evidence, but we should not be attacking someone with so much vitriol that they withdraw from academia. I'm glad to read that Cinq-Mars is getting the vindication that he deserves. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So if the Aztecs were out campaigning in, say, modern day Oaxaca, the brunt of the military force would have come from the Triple Alliance proper?

According to Hassig, that is what it sounds like though he does not offer a ton of detail on the subject.

 What would 'marching separately' entail, if you know? Did they just have a different path? Were they at least led by trustworthy people, or would they have been led by their own captains? Having a tribute army lead themselves seems kind of iffy, especially if they kind of hate you as well.

Marching order began with priests bearing images or figures of the gods. They left one day before the warriors. The next day the military orders and veteran warriors with generals left from Tenochtitlan. The third day the rest of the soldiers from Tenochtitlan with the farmer-soldiers grouped according to unit. Finally, soldiers from the cities listed above would then leave one day apart from the other. Needless to say, the entire army did not march at once.

Hassig says that this was not based on ritual, but done for logistic reasons. If an army of tens of thousands began to march, the end of the column would not be able to march until hours after the head of the column left. By staggering the days in which soldiers left you could avoid the standing and waiting. Also by staggering the days it creates somewhat of a less burden on towns that had to pay tribute such as food along the way. The staggered deployment also reduces camp size and the amount of water needed for the troops.

Different routes could be taken so that multiple groups could arrive simultaneously at one destination. However, doing so leaves these units open for attack and reduces the effectiveness of gathered intelligence about the terrain, towns, and conditions ahead. If using multiple routes, if a unit was attacked en route there would be no or fewer units behind them that could reinforce the attacked unit. Using a single route allows staggered units to reinforce each other along the route should someone attack.

Hassig does not discuss who led the units during a march, but presumably it was generals or other high ranking military leaders. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you have the locations mixed up for maize, tomatoes, wheat, and barley.

The only common crop used between the New and Old worlds are gourds which were both independently domesticated. Gourds are great to use as vessels and water storage containers without the need to develop ceramics or make bladders from animal tissues. For the Americas, gourds seem to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago (Smith 1997). At this time people had been living in the Americas for at least four thousand to ten thousand years. Other crops like maize and tomatoes were domesticated several thousand years later after the gourd (Coe 1994).

<TEXT> In Ross Hassig's book, *Aztec warfare: Imperial expansion and political control* (1988: 54-55), he mentions that the Aztecs would marshal troops in response to the severity of the thread. For small threats and small armies, seasoned troops were usually marshalled first beginning with soldiers from Tenochtitlan, then Tetzcoco, and then Tlacopan. Should a threat be serious enough or should the Aztecs require a greater number of people, they would begin to marshall troops from cities within the Basin of Mexico and then their surrounding territories and finally the most distant territories. If the threat was of the utmost severity or they needed their maximum amount of troops the Aztecs would marshall youths and old men to aid in the fighting. 

Troops were marshalled by a high official such as a commanding general. The order for troops would work their way down the political hierarchy until it reached the calpolli level where neighborhood or barrio leaders would let those in their calpolli know of the order. 

Most soldiers were only part-time soldiers. For the most part soldiers were simply farmers who were mobilized in the fall and winter to fight larger conflicts when grain stores were full and the wet season were over. The Aztecs did have professional soldiers such as the jaguar and eagle warrior orders and could, presumably, be called to fight during the spring and summer when the commoner soldiers were busy filling, planting, sowing, and harvesting their crops.

As for how the order would go from Tenochtitlan to the territories, Hassig does not say. My guess would be that a runner would be dispatched with the order to mobilize should the need arise for non-Triple Alliance cities and settlements to provide soldiers for the war effort.

Should territorial cities and settlements need to provide soldiers, Hassig (1988: 68) briefly mentions in the marching order that subject towns were obligated to provide soldiers to the Aztecs for war once a year, presumably as part of their tribute obligations. These tribute soldiers marched separately from the Triple Alliance cities, Tepanecs, Xilotepecas, Matlatzincas, and "the rest of the cities".

I hope this answers your question. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

<TEXT> I do not believe there is sufficient evidence to confirm that the Aztecs could read Maya hieroglyphic writing. That is not to say because the Maya were no longer writing, but that their writing was much more restricted in the Postclassic. Rather than having texts featured on stela or monuments proclaiming the feats of a king, their genealogy, and major life events as the Maya liked to do in the Classic, by the Postclassic writing was restricted to murals within buildings, painted vessels that were often sent as gifts to other nobles, and in paper or deer skin codices. The use of the hieroglyphic system continued to the colonial period as evident in Friar Diego de Landa's writings. After his famous torching of Maya books, de Landa felt remorse years later and attempted to preserve what knowledge he could of their writing. Unfortunately with de Landa's limited understanding of other writing systems he was only able to create a list of sounds associated with some signs and did not record how words or sentences were formed. It wasn't until the 20th century that epigraphers made a breakthrough in understanding that the glyphs used in Maya writing were syllabic with parts of glyphs coming together to form words. Difficulties still lie today in understanding logograms, or glyphs made up of a unique symbol with little to no syllabic elements incorporated into their design. Without someone telling you what a logogram means or finding a text where a scribe wrote out phonetically what a logogram was, there is no real way of translating the glyph. Often these logograms are the names of people or places rather than verbs, other nouns, or other grammatical elements.

For the Aztecs, their interaction with the Maya region was largely indirect and distant. Between Central Mexico and the Maya region there were many physical, social, and political barriers to cross. That did not stop the Aztecs from conquering or controlling territory as they made their way east to the Maya region, most likely in the hopes of securing more stable and secure trade routes for goods like cacao, quetzal feathers, and other goods. Instead of using a hieroglyphic system of writing like the Maya, Zapotec, or Epi-Olmec, the Aztecs made use of pictographs in conjunction with artwork to act as mnemonic devices to recall already memorized knowledge or to create simple tributary lists from their territories. While Aztec art and writing could become very elaborate, their writing does not come close to being able to be read without outside context as Maya writing is able to be read.

But, who knows? Archaeologists are always finding new things. It is certainly possible, though unlikely, that there was someone in Central Mexico that could read Maya writing. It would be difficult to prove, even with Maya writing on murals or vessels, without other likelier explanations (such as importing a foreign artist for the murals or foreign vessels to gain prestige/power/capital).  </TEXT>

Chiles provided a cheap way to spice food without importing more expensive spices from Asia. Tobacco provided the economic incentive for English colonists to settle the US eastern seaboard. Cacao and vanilla have provided staple flavors for desserts the world over. To say they were not influential is to express a profound ignorance of history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Aztecs sacrificed people and animals because life itself was the greatest thing you could offer the gods. The gods created the world, created life, created maize, bring rain, ensure crops are bountiful, etc. It would be almost insulting to offer them anything less than the most precious thing you could ever own, life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Maya were always a loose collection of city-states with a shared culture and language family. No one city-state controlled an sort of empire, though they did make alliances.

When the Spanish arrived it took them a long time to pacify the area. As soon as they conquered one city-state everyone else rose up against them. If they moved on to another city-state the one they conquered rose up in rebellion. The last Maya kingdom to be conquered fell in 1697 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Make pasties!

Make four batches of this [pie dough](https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/11/pie-crust-102-all-butter-really-flaky-pie-dough/) and set aside.

Cut up 5 pounds of potatoes, 2 large onions, 2 medium rutabaga, 5 medium carrots and place in a very large bowl. Add 1 pound ground pork and 1 pound ground beef. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mix that all up.

Take each dough ball and cut it into thirds. Roll the dough out very thin. I like to use a medium plate to cut the dough into a nice circle. Save the scraps for later. Using a 1 cup measuring cup, add a heaping cup of veggie and meat filling to each dough circle. Fold the dough and crimp. Repeat until all your dough balls are used up. Roll the scraps together and make a few more. 

Bake the pasties at 350 for ~ 45 minutes. If you want to eat some right away, bake for 15 minutes more. If you want to save them for later, at the 45 minute mark pull them out of the oven and let cool slightly. Then put them in freezer bags and throw them in the freezer. When you want to eat one, bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees and do not thaw them out.

If you did all this, you should have at least a dozen pasties. When I make these I usually spend about $40 between a bag of flour, the butter, meat, and veggies.

Pasties were the peasant food for copper and iron miners in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. They are now a staple regional dish. Most people eat them with ketchup, some eat them plain, and heathens eat them with gravy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no way of knowing for certain. Disease was not introduced until Cortes and his men showed up at Tenochtitlan. While smallpox did kill a few million in the 1520s, it wasn't until the 1540s that the Basin saw 12 million people killed from an outbreak. I would say that if disease was somehow introduced, the Aztecs would have been weakened and may have lost territory as their subjects rebelled against them. However, if the Aztecs were hit by an outbreak so, too, would everyone else. So their more unruly subjects may have been too weak to rebel.

By the way, there was no Maya empire. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe it is authentic. Featherworking was an art form that did not survive the colonial period.

As Nuevo Mundo says, the creature is either a coyote or an ahuizotl. I'm not too sure why this figure, if it is an ahuizotl, differs from other depictions of the creature.

The headdress is known as [Montezuma's headdress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montezuma's_headdress), though it probably was not actually Moctezuma's. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are correct that fringes are made out of feathers. In section "Defensive Weapons" in Ross Hassig's book *Aztec Warfare* (1988: 85-88), he covers the topic of shields. While Hassig describes different construction material and methods for shields, he does not describe the fringe as anything but feathers. However, Hassig does not specify which feathers were used for the creation of a shield fringe, only that shield used feathers and the feathers offered protection by deflecting projectiles. If you look at the [feather shield](http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/images-5/543_16_2.jpg) located at the Museum fur Volkerkunde, Vienna, you can see that the feather fringe of this shield is not made with long feathers like the quetzal feather. Instead, it appears to have been made from shorter feathers. If feather shield construction is like other featherworking in Aztec culture, these feathers should have come from any number of birds and have been dyed before being attached to the shield.

I hope this clears up any confusion.

<TEXT> No, they did not have writing. The cooperating and competing lineages is a hypothesized political system based on archaeological data. The Teuchitlan culture lacks any palace structures or elite residences. Elite status is expressed in how elaborate their burials are and how elaborate their mortuary goods are. The way these guachimontones are constructed also hint towards a system of cooperation with sections of the temple constructed differently from every other section. Normally this might be thought of as simply work groups like at Chan Chan, but Chan Chan has clear signs of elite individuals. I recommend reading Beekman's 2008 article that covers this topic </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well thanks. I felt bad for the OP because I couldn't find an answer for him and his question was gaining traction. I thought the least I could do is provide a different avenue into answering his question.

I don't know if you saw RioAbajo's post on the variability in the Maya hieroglyphic writing, but he is correct that words can be spelled a number of ways. I do wonder, however, are any of these alternate spellings actually typos? I guess the fact that no one has documented typos on stone monuments may attest to how careful the sculptors were in making these things. You combine that with the fact that there are very few large stone carvings and typos may not be found. Take Copan's hieroglyphic staircase. If you make a typo, all you have to do is swap out the stone block that makes the stair.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maya writing is largely syllabic based with pieces of glyph elements combined together to form a word. The Maya also made use of glyphs called logograms. Logograms are glyphs that comprise an entire word, but are not made of the syllabic elements (though some may have syllabic elements incorporated into the design, like a T-shape ik sign for wind on the cheek of a person). Take Wikipedia's examples for jaguar. You have this logogram for jaguar or [b'alam](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Balam_1.svg/200px-Balam_1.svg.png). Then take the [syllabic spelling](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Balam_2.svg/270px-Balam_2.svg.png) composed of three elements, ba (leftmost sign), la (top sign], and ma (bottom sign).  </TEXT>

Not always. On ceramics or on plaster surfaces the glyphs could be painted, but they could also be incised on ceramics or moulded with plaster. The more famous examples of hieroglyphs carved into stone would be the stela the Maya erected around their sites to commemorate their kings or Copan's [hieroglyphic staircase](https://decipherment.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/dsc_0136.jpg). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Abrams uses the formula `m^3 /p-d = Q x (1 / (L/V + L/V') ) x H` after Aaberg and Bonsignore (1975) where Q = the quantity per load, L = lead or transport distance (kilometers), V = velocity (loaded), a constant of 3 km/h, V' = velocity (unloaded), a constant of 5 km/h, and H = hours worked per day 

Q for tuff is assumed to be a 22 kg load. The density for tuff is 1 m^3 weighs 1836 kg. A 22 kg load would equate to 0.01 m^3 .

L is the distance to the quarry. The tuff quarry at Copan is located 1 kilometer north of the Main Group. 

Abrams does not say, but I believe he uses a 5 hour work day.

Plugging this all in you get 0.09375 and Abrams rounded up to the nearest tenth of a meter.

The weight of the material is divided by the output to get the amount of days required to transport the material.

<TEXT> Thank you for pointing out that I messed up the square centimeters. I also misread Abrams' unit for the rate of work.

<TEXT>  I have to admit, I was quite surprised by how quick that is. 

Apologies, it was 89 cm^2 per hour, not per day. I'm so use to seeing p-d (person-day) that I did not notice the d was an h. Also I bungled the amount of square centimeters by a lot to my shame. I fixed the rate of work in my post above.

 Does Abrams offer any comparison to the labor required to procure the substrate (i.e. quarry, transport, and shape the stone before fine carving)?

To procure tuff, Abrams uses the rate of 750 kg a day assuming a five hour work day. 

To transport the tuff, the output is 0.1 m^3 per trip. This is due to the weight of tuff and the distance from the source. So 183.6 kg of tuff would require 1836 days to move. 

For dressing masonry, the rate of work is 1 m^3 per 11.6 days.

Masonry walls that averaged 25 cm thick were able to be constructed at a rate of 0.8 m^3 a day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw this question posted awhile ago and did some hunting on Google Scholar. Unfortunately, I could not find anything that discusses ancient Maya typos. What I can tell you, though, is how much labor may have gone into carving hieroglyphs into stone.

Elliot Abrams is an archaeologist who really pioneered the study of architectural energetics. Architectural energetics is the study of labor through an analysis of a building. You measure a building, find the volume of materials needed to construct the building, and use rates of work taken from replicative experiments to estimate the amount of time it took to procure construction material, transport the material, and ultimately construct a building. This is what my thesis is on, but I will stick to Abrams' case study.

In Abrams' career he has examined numerous buildings at the site of Copan, Honduras. In his 1994 book *How the Maya Built Their World*, Abrams examined residential structures that ranged from a palace for Copan's 13th king to small platforms used by commoners to construct perishable buildings. For Abrams' analysis of the palace, labeled Structure 10L-22, Abrams had to estimate the amount of labor it would take to create the decorative sculpture found at the palace. The sculpture found at the palace ranged from simple decorative elements like bars and dots to more complex designs like glyphs and faces. 

To create a rate of work, Abrams employed a part-time sculptor from the town of Copan. Using stone tools and locally quarried tuff, a light, porous rock formed by consolidation of volcanic ash that hardens when exposed to air, used in the construction of Copan's buildings, Abrams found that the sculptor was able to replicate complex designs like glyphs and faces at a rate of 89 cm^2 an hour. So, if you had a wall that was 2.5 m high by 5 m wide (125,000 cm^2) and a sculptor worked eight hours a day, it would take a sculptor 175.56 days to carve. This assumes the sculptor made no mistakes and knew what he wanted to write beforehand. This rate of work would change depending on the material and skill of the sculptor.

I know this is only a partial answer and may be less than satisfactory, but perhaps it provides a sense of scale and time needed to create such things like hieroglyphs on a wall.

<TEXT> I thought this was a neat article. While the translation of the inscription is still being worked out, the inscription seems to indicate that a royal family moved to the site of Nim Li Punit. Whether this was the original owner of the pendant or a descendant is uncertain since the pendant was found in a dedicatory offering rather than with the remains of a person. The T-shape of the pendant, which resembles the glyph ik for wind, its inscription, and a ceramic vessel found with the pendant seems to indicate this pendant was associated with the wind god and possibly the need for rain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This answer depends on where you live since each country can be different. If you are in the U.S., you would attend a university with an anthropology department that has faculty who are archaeologists. You cannot really study just archaeology by itself since the field is a sub-field of anthropology in the U.S. You can, however, focus your studies on archaeology. You should do your best to try and narrow your interests in archaeology to a particular culture, region, or time period and choose your school that fits with those interests. If you are interested in Classical Greece, you do not want to necessarily go to a school that focuses on 19th century frontier archaeology in Nevada.

You would not be trained for the job by attending classes at a university. For archaeological work you would have to attend a field school. You may have to pay out of pocket for the field school or you can earn credit towards graduation by attending a field school through your university. The sooner you can attend a field school, the better. Sometimes people who get their BA and then do a field school realize they hate field work. They then have to try and salvage what they learned getting their degree to get a job doing something else.

To actually go out and do archaeology, you have one of two routes. You can simply get your BA in Anthropology, attend a field school, and look for work at CRM (Cultural Resource Management) company. At CRM company you will be doing survey work and salvage excavations in areas where people wish to build highways, construct things, mine, drill for oil/gas, etc. There's not much research involved. In order to get ahead in CRM company you would have to get at least a Master's degree. To get on top you may need a PhD.

The other route for archaeology is academia. In academia you can conduct research on topics that may interest you, but you have to contend with the academic world. To get there you need to get a PhD. Anything less will not suffice. Even if you get a PhD, there is no guarantee you will find a university or museum position. If you are lucky enough to get a position, you then have to teach classes, write for grant money, and publish frequently enough to not be fired. During all of those activities you have to try and squeeze in time for fieldwork and data analysis. If you go the academic route you should know that archaeology is what you want to do and be sure about it. It is a big commitment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No one has mentioned it yet, but get a snow blower or [snow scoop](http://www.silverbear.biz). Houghton averages 218 inches of snow a year. You won't survive with just a simple shovel, especially if you have to clear a driveway. Also, keep a large bag of kitty litter and some hard sticks of wood to wedge under your tires in your trunk in case you get stuck.

Personally, I think the best pasties in town are from Roy's. So if you want to try a pasty, I suggest to go to there.

The most stand-offish people tend to be Apostolic Lutherans. They are a Christian sect that are unfriendly to those who don't go to their church. They tend to be mostly blonde haired and blue eyed, drive around in big vans, and have a dozen kids. You have to be friendly to them, though, because they control some businesses in town. Most of us are friendly. Just complain about the weather, ask how the Packers are doing, ask if someone bagged a deer and how many points it had, and inquiry about the area's history. You will get a lot of people asking "What the heck are you doing up here?"

If you want to go thimbleberry picking the best spots are along snowmobile trails, but you have to fight people for them. The Jam Pot up near Copper Harbor and the Jam Lady in Eagle Harbor pay big bucks for the berries to make into jam. It took me hours and tons of driving around this summer to get enough to make a pie.

For outside activities, rock hounding and metal detecting is fun. Agates are the most popular stone to find on beaches as well as green stone. Personally, I've been on the lookout for datolite. The mineral museum has some great specimens. As for metal detecting, hunting for native copper in and around old mining rock piles is fun. Sometimes you can find some huge chunks. Be careful when detecting, though. There are lots of unsealed mine pits and shafts and you don't want to fall through. You also don't want to uncover any copper tools in Old Copper Complex Native American burials and have to deal with NAGPRA.

You should familiarize yourself with how the Loop works and how traffic flows going each way across the bridge. Just go to Google Maps and plug in destinations like Vollwerth to Econo Food's, Vollwerth to The Continental Fire Co, Econo Food's to Kaleva Cafe, Ambassador to Miners State Bank, Ambassador to Econo Food's, and Ambassador to Kaleva Cafe.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Natural foods can contain toxic chemicals. It depends on what is in the soil and what the plant is able to absorb and store in its leaves, seeds, fruit, etc.

Take tobacco, for instance. The plant easily absorbs heavy metals from the ground and stores the metals in its leaves. Even if you add no additives to the tobacco, the heavy metals will be released when you smoke the leaf. Those metals can and do increase your chances of cancer.

Or, take tomatoes for a plant you eat. Normally you eat the fruit of the plant and avoid the leaves or stalk. Why? Well, tomato leaves contain alkaloids and if you eat enough of the leaves, you'll die. Tomatoes are natural, yet they can kill you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  even if it was NA why do we allow religious superstition to dictate what we can and can't study?

Because anthropologists study humanity and part of that study is to respect other people's beliefs and customs. The Native Americans in the region, who share a genetic link to Kennewick Man, believe that the dead should stay buried and their bones unmutilated. As anthropologists we must respect that belief. 

 I just was not convinced (nor do I think the professor's were set in stone on the issue) that tribal interests always come first on this kinda thing.

That is somewhat disappointing that you cannot see the point of view of Native Americans. How would you feel if Russia invaded the US, systematically attacked Americans, and did everything else in their power to destroy your culture, history, and beliefs? Would you want them to dig up your family's remains and perform tests on them? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Because apparently we think the Bering Strait hypothesis is too late. 

It's not too late. The Bering Strait is the point of origin, that's not disputed. What is too late is the ice free corridor that was hypothesized to allow people to freely move from Alaska, through Canada, and into the US. Instead, the current hypothesis is that people traveled along the coast (possibly by boat) which accounts for their rapid dispersal to places like Monte Verde as early as 18,000 to 14,000 BP. This also takes into account the lack of an ice-free corridor. Multiple waves are also hypothesized with very early and later dispersals, though genetic work is both [clarifying](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16462) and [obscuring](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/48/17060.abstract?sid=44e3778e-32b1-4fd6-b246-4a31950648ce) that picture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cultivation is different from domestication. You can cultivate wild plants and animals without domesticating them. The Maya, for example, had great pens full of deer at Mayapan to create a steady source of meat, leather, and bone. That does not mean that the Maya domesticated the deer.

The deeper time use of plant cultivation makes sense because domesticated plants do not pop up out of nowhere. It takes many years, decades, centuries, or even millennia before a plant is suitable to widespread adoption for agriculture. Maize is a good example. It went from [teosinte](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k3WhlO8mQNo/UlqIseUIztI/AAAAAAAABeA/7gE5RQT9heA/s1600/Maize-teosinte.jpg) pictured on the left to the cob we know now on the right over the course of thousands of years. And teosinte is not a plant you want to try and eat. The seeds are hard and do not produce a good flour. You can pop them, but the popped kernels are gross. There's not much you can do with it until you get to the middle stage and even then, you'll notice that the kernels are not as large or flesh as our modern cobs.

Seeing as how the Neolithic Revolution was a widespread transition from largely hunting-gathering to farming, I would say the dates are just fine where they are at. Hunting-gathering does not interfere with people creating gardens or experimenting with plant cultivation in their spare time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really know of one. So many factors were at play at play at colonization that to have a book explore each and every thing would create a massive tome. 

For example, you had the condition of Spain at the time after expelling the Moors, you had the Ottomans restricting trade along the Silk Road, you had competeting with other countries to make trade deals or find new trade routes, you had the history of diseases in Europe and how they passed from wild and domesticated animals to humans, you had the role of human agency making decisions about colonization and how to interact with Native Americans, etc. 

And that's just Europe. The same things could be applied to the Americas to understand its history and how it developed and why it developed the way it did. By the time you finished writing said hypothetical book, new research would have come out that changed the way the past is viewed and interpreted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It probably isn't recent. It might instead be very old and was introduced prior to paleoindians migrating into the Americas. 2% of Neanderthal and/or Denisovan DNA is present in some people and that DNA is tens of thousands of years old. I think this 2% indicates a common point of origin for both South American and Australoid populations. Perhaps this common origin split with one group going to southeast Asia and the other heading northeast towards the Bering Strait. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The Xavante, Surui and Karitiana people of Brazil all have Australoid (specifically, Australian or Papua New Guinean) descent.

Before you make such grand claims, you should specify two things.

 "We don't know the order, the time separation or the geographical patterns," said Skoglund.

 "About 2 percent of the ancestry of Amazonians today comes from this Australasian lineage that's not present in the same way elsewhere in the Americas," said Reich.

[source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150721134827.htm)

So it's not a significant amount of ancestry and without knowing the time depth, it could be a relatively recent addition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are correct that most epidemics experienced by New World peoples came from the Old World. But as anthropology_nerd discusses in her [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2cfhon/guns_germs_and_steel_chapter_11_lethal_gift_of/) over at /r/badhistory, many of the diseases may not have come from domesticated animals, but wild animals. Buffalo, antelopes, giraffes, wildebeests, and warthogs can all carry the measles and pass them onto people just as easily as cattle. Tuberculosis could have come from deer, llamas, pigs, cats, coyotes, and rodents. The same TB that infects people was even recovered from a 17,000 year old North American bison and may indicate the presence of TB in the New World long before the arrival of Europeans. And the list goes on.

So take Diamond's work with a grain of salt. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the movie the hot wire was not used to treat glaucoma. Bill tells the doctor in the movie scene that a different doctor years previous had used the wire to treat his "troubles". From the context, his troubles sounds like an STD from the "infected females" referenced by the first doctor. In the movie scene the doctor on screen is diagnosing the glaucoma as a result of Bill's earlier STD infection.

I'm sorry if I did not make this very clear in my question. And my question is not about the treatment of glaucoma with a hot wire, but whether STDs were treated with a hot wire inserted into the penis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the movie the doctor is checking Bill's eyes. He tells Bill he has 2 to even 10 years before the glaucoma gets really bad. In the movie the doctor is telling Bill that his glaucoma is somehow linked to his proximity to "infected females". They just don't discuss what the infection is exactly. I assumed they were talking about STDs and that an STD was the purported to be the cause for the glaucoma.

If any of you have Amazon Prime, the scene in question starts at 16:10. I could not find it on YouTube. [Biography.com](http://www.biography.com/people/wild-bill-hickok-40262#final-years), for what it is worth, also states that Bill had glaucoma. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not much in the way of history or archaeology has really explored chilis in Aztec society or Mesoamerica as a whole. That is changing, but the change is slow.

In the Florentine Codex, Sahagun does describe the chilis consumed by the Aztecs in the context of the good and bad chili seller. Chilis in Aztec cuisine came in all manner of shapes, sizes, colors, tastes, origins (Huaxteca, Michoacan, and Atzitziuacan for example) and spiciness (Anderson and Dibble 1961: 67-68). However, Sahagun makes no mention whether spiciness was the most important factor. Instead, chilis were seen as a way to bring out the flavor of foods as salt does. Even the foliage of the chili plant was eaten since it lacked the alkaloids in the leaves like the tomato.

While food can be spicy and the capsaicin levels do have curative properties, it does not seem that challenging each other to eat super spicy food was much of an activity in Aztec society. Such curative properties include treating "roughness of the face". First the face is washed with hot urine and then it is smeared with powdered yellow chili. The yellow chilli is allowed to dry and when the powder falls off the face is again washed with urine or wormwood. This is followed by drinking the sap of the herb called *tlatlauhqui* which will then be urinated out. As one urinates out the herb the urine may be red in color, full of pus, or even contain kidney stones. After the body is purged the person can only drink water and must avoid pulque and spoiled fatty food (Anderson and Dibble 1961: 143). 

Chilis were also used to treat tooth infections. The person first mixes pine resin and ground *conyayaoal* worms together and then applies this paste to the surface of the tooth. Next the person places a heated chili onto the surface of the tooth followed by salt. After that the gums are pricked and the herb *tlalacauatl* is applied. Sahagun says that if this does not work the tooth is removed and salt is packed into the tooth socket (Anderson and Dibble 1961: 146).

Chilis were also combined with chocolate, *tlilxochitl*, *vei nacaztli*, liquid ruber, *mecaxochitl*, and water to cure a person if they are spitting up blood. You can also drink the chocolate and herbs in pulque, but you must not include the liquid rubber or chilis (Anderson and Dibble 1961: 154).

Chilis were also used to cure people from being struck with a lash or stick. On the swollen and or welted flesh *pozaulizpatli* is smeared on. After that, the person must go into a sweat bath where the person drinks a mixture of *iztac patli*, *chichipiltic*, chilis, and pulque. This mixture will apparently circulate the blood and help cure the person (Anderson and Dibble 1961: 162).

The spiciness of chilis were sometimes used to inflict pain on people. In order to discipline a particularly unruly child, parents would hold the heads of their child above a [small fire that was burning chilis](http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/images-6/680_05_2.jpg). The capsaicin would mix with the smoke and create a sort of tear gas which the child would inhale and get into their eyes (Berdan and Anawalt 1997: 161).

The use of chili smoke was even used against the Aztecs by the lords of Cuetlaxtlan in a conflict. The Tlaxcalans had convinced the Cuextlaxtlan lords to rebel and kill the Aztec governor, which they did. And when messengers arrived to Cuextlaxtlan to ask why the lords had not given tribute, the lords put the messenger in a sealed room full of chili smoke until they suffocated and died (Berdan and Anawalt 1997: 123).

As researchers continue to look for chili peppers in the archaeological record and [test ceramics](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079013) for the presence of chilis, we may be able to flesh out our understanding of the pepper in pre-Columbian times. Who knows? Maybe we can even find the Scoville value of pre-Columbian chilis and be better able to answer your question on spiciness of the peppers.

<TEXT> Thanks for tagging me. Despite the popularity of posting the article to /r/history yesterday, there was very little discussion on how plausible it was that salmonella was cocoliztli or if salmonella just happened to be concurrent to cocoliztli, as you pointed out. 

When I read this Nature article I feel like it was a bit sensationalized and blown out of proportion. The studies they link to are preprints posted on a server. Who's to say the authors were not going to make changes to their paper? Or that peer-review input was not incorporated yet? Maybe the preprint was to just test the format for the paper before submission? These concerns are not satiated with the samples coming from Oaxaca. Was Oaxaca hit with the same cocoliztli epidemic? Did it have the same rates of death? Do the authors adequately address the geographic and demographic differences between the Basin of Mexico and Oaxaca? 

This is just big news and it generates lots of questions. I know that you and 400-rabbits may not be able to answer them, but maybe we can talk about them.  </TEXT>

 As I understand it 4 priests held a victim over a ceremonial stone and the 5 priest kill them

Is it four groups of five priests? I thought it was only four people doing the heart extraction, not four people total.

Either way, you need to have a lot of people working to get through 10,000 people in four days. It seems too fantastic to have actually occurred. </TEXT>

Kinda, but kind of not. The Postclassic is less understood and published than the Classic period. This gives a skewed view of the past in which the Classic seems to have thrived better than their Postclassic descendants. This paper by [Diane Chase](http://www.caracol.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dchase92.pdf) and this paper by [Jeremy Sabloff](https://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/151102.pdf) discuss this issue in better detail than I. Suffice to say, though. the Maya were still thriving in the 1300s and into the colonial period. The last Maya kingdom to be conquered were the Itza Maya and that occurred in 1697.

 Great civilizations came and went in the Americas, not everything that happened in the new world revolved around Europeans.

<TEXT> By trying to link these effects to a single cause of disease completely removes indigenous agency before, during, and after the events of the Conquest of Mexico. You're basically saying they have no will and simply react to outside stimuli like disease. I'm not denying that disease had no role in the conquest, but other factors are at play. The Tlaxcalans choosing to ally with the Spanish. The Aztecs choosing to ally with the Spanish after their defeat. The Purepecha choosing to surrender to the Spanish and join them rather than try to fight it out. People made these choices and disease did not limit their choices to the ones they made in the past. The Tlaxcalans could have fought the Spanish before disease impacted them. The Purepecha could have gone down fighting. The Aztecs could have refused to cooperate with the Spanish. Don't be that person who tries to pinpoint one single thing as the cause for everything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right, we should be saying Mexico. I disagree with your assertion that Mexica society didn't exist after the Spanish conquest. It's not as if every living Mexica simply adopted Spanish customs in 1521. It took time for Mexica culture to wane as elders passed away and could not pass on their knowledge and Catholic missionaries took over the job of the calmecac to teach the population. If Mexica culture disappeared right after 1521 than Friar Bernardino de Sahagn would never have been able to write the Florentine Codex. You could argue that by 1600 Mexica culture had been greatly reduced, but that would take into account 80 years of epidemics (like the one in the article) and Catholic missionary and colonial government work.

No, Mexico means "place of the Mexica". Mexico is made up of two words, Mexica and -co. In Nahuatl -co is a postposition that can be translated as from, by, to, or on but is also used as place name signifier like -tlan. When you add -co to a word you drop the last vowel. So Mexica becomes Mexico and Mexico means place of Mexica.

Mexica comes from the word mexicatl which simply means a habitant of Mexico. The word moon is metztli and is completely different from Mexica or Mexico.

You can check the Nahuatl in Remi Simeon's *Diccionario de la lengua nahuatl o mexicana* (1977) or Alonso de Molina's *Vocabulario en lengua castellana y mexicana* (1585) or UOregon's [online dictionary](http://whp.uoregon.edu/dictionaries/nahuatl/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the first time I've seen salmonella linked to the 1545 outbreak that wiped out a huge portion of the population in the Basin of Mexico.  It's interesting how healthy people can carry the disease, but pass it on to others through poor sanitation. I'm curious how this might change the discussion of early colonial history in Mexico </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Do you know whether these Colima figures have piercings?

The figures from Colima do not show very many piercings. I normally see piercings on the [solid figures](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/11/02/bf/1102bfe624f7323feee21d4f11a2fb35.jpg) rather than the hollow figures. Depictions of piercings are more common for figures from Jalisco and Nayarit. Their piercings are not like other Mesoamerican piercings. Instead of ear spools and labrets they have [multiple earrings and nose ornaments](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/6c/19/c3/6c19c35b9fe6cefba866c12c38d1a71e.jpg). That's not to say there are no ear spools, but they are are uncommon. 

Jalisco and Nayarit figures also show many more [body markings](http://www.archaeology.org/images/ND2013/Tattoos/western-shaft-tomb-tattoo.jpg) than Colima figures. I'm not sure if this is body paint or tattoos. The [shoulder bumps](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/hb/hb_1979.355.jpg) present on some figures have been interpreted as scarification since they appear on figures with and without shirts. </TEXT>

No, this did not happen. Or else you are confusing the epidemics encountered by US Eastern seaboard peoples after the arrival of the Spanish to the Caribbean and Mexico.

 So, when the Vikings landed, they discovered a large and unfriendly population which drove them off.

<TEXT> Hammerstedt (2005: 51-52) surveyed 190 examples of trees cut with a stone ax from Europe, North America, South America, and New Guinea. Trees ranged from 1 to 73cm in diameter with a mean of 17cm. He found that the mean time of felling a tree was just 25 minutes. I'm not sure how that compares to metal axes, however.

<TEXT> Perhaps if they show no evidence of a function, the very act of construction was the purpose for the earthworks. When you need to build something that large, you need other people to help out or the project will take forever. And when you bring people together you have opportunities to share stories, recall history, play matchmaker, trade items, throw feasts, and strengthen the bonds of family and friendship all under the guise of this construction project. At least, that's what Wesley Bernardini argues for the Hopewell mounds in Ohio in his 2003 paper

<TEXT>  They had metallurgy, but had not yet entered the bronze, or what we would typicalyl think of as metal working (smelting to create alloys, they only had heating and hot/cold hammering techniques of metals found in purish forms).

Mesoamerica and South America had bronze. They also were experts at alloying gold, silver, and copper together to create gold looking items with far less gold than what was needed and vice versa for silver. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The difference between Mann's book and Diamond's book is that Mann doesn't try to offer explanations or create overarching hypotheses about the past based on cherry-picked information. Diamond does just that and that is why academics rag on his book. No one rags on Mann's book because it is a survey of research and the literature at the time he wrote it. </TEXT>

I agree with this if you mean encourage imagination to find solutions to problems using physical, collected data from a secure context.

<TEXT> For clarification, there was no Maya empire. The Maya were a collection of city-states with a shared culture and language family. No one city-state dominated all the others, though large alliances can and did form.

Further clarification, the Aztecs and Maya are also in North America. North America extends from the Arctic to Panama, after all. But I am guessing you meant people north of the Rio Grande.

<TEXT> Yes, in some cases people were buried in a flexed position. People were also buried [supine](http://i.imgur.com/KtBOEWd.jpg) or prose if the burial space was large enough. There are even cases of [bundles of bones](http://i.imgur.com/DASucAu.jpg) being placed in burials as well as cremated and semi-cremated remains placed in ceramic vessels. Despite the focus of burials in [shaft tombs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/43tvqk/do_the_burial_sites_of_the_shaft_tomb_cultures/) during the Late Formative to Classic periods in this region, there is a surprisingly wide arrange of burial types across Nayarit, Jalisco, and Colima. What I have not seen in the literature is the mention of mummy bundles. If West Mexico has mummy bundles my guess is that they would be from the Epiclassic or Postclassic periods with the introduction of more stereotypical eastern Mexican cultural practices. </TEXT>

I know I've had a great time finding [guachimontones](http://i.imgur.com/WLGl8lv.png) around the Tequila valleys of Jalisco in Google Earth. I've even tried to find some of the guachimontones located in the Bajo at sites like La Gloria. [Guachimontones](http://i.imgur.com/ms4Ats5.png) are somewhat easy to spot, though, since they are round and stick out from the landscape. The square buildings on the hill around the Palacio de Ocomo at Oconahua, for example, are difficult to spot with the combination of vegetation, inadequate resolution, and unsatisfactory lighting in Google Earth. </TEXT>

I'm not sure how the Nahuatl taught in this app differs from Classic Nahuatl scholars look at in the early colonial period yet, but it should be interesting and fun to check out. The article also mentions that an app is in the works for Purepecha, the indigenous language spoken in the Michoacan region and the former Tarascan Empire, the rivals of the Aztecs.

 The Europeans had already suffered through various plagues

As did Native Americans. They did not live in a disease-free vacuum, they just lived without Old World diseases.

 the Native Americans got hit with all those plagues at once.

They were hit with successive waves of disease, they were not hit with everyone all at once. It took a century just for the Basin of Mexico to go from a few million to less than a million people. </TEXT>

You might want to rethink your notion of how Native Americans lived. Don't confuse Plains peoples in the 1800s with all Native Americans in North and South America. I could list a number of dense urban centers in Mexico and South America, but you may try to brush that off. So instead, I would say look at the American Southwest, the Mississippian peoples, Southeastern peoples, and the sizes of Native towns in the Northeast. Cahokia, especially, should stand out with its population in the tens of thousands. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  For the sake of scale/context, how big is that dome on the left

The dome measures about 37.5m in diameter, 8m in total height. The entire structure, from platform to platform, measures approximately 99m. This circular arrangement of platforms around a patio space and central structure we call an altar is called a guachimonton.

The naming can get confusing. The site in the picture above is called [Los Guachimontones](http://imgur.com/a/kt0HJ) and is named after a district in the town this site is located near. Each individual structure, however, is called a guachimonton. The town is called Teuchitlan and we named the culture who built these structures the Teuchitlan culture.

At Los Guachimontones there are eight guachimontones and two ballcourts. There is a sister site located further up the hill with five guachimontones and one ballcourt. The immediate area of these two sites makes this the largest site in the Tequila valleys.

There are about 50 or so guachimontones in the Tequila valleys with one in the Bolaos canyon to the north, one by Puerto Vallarta,  one by the town of Comala in Colima, one in the western area of the Atemajac Valley (where Guadalajara is), and several in Guanajuato to the east. There's supposedly one in Nayarit and another at La Campana in Colima, though I've never seen pictures or drawings of it.

 Speculatively, why is this not discussed or researched? Funding? Interest? Not sexy enough?

Jalisco, Nayarit, and Colima are known more for their large and small, hollow and solid [ceramic figures](https://www.google.com/search?q=shaft+tomb+figures source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ved=0ahUKEwjagrfHwf7RAhWni1QKHXCCBuoQ_AUICSgC biw=1536 bih=736) and dioramas that are attributed to the shaft and chamber tombs the dead were buried in at that time. Gong as far back as the Early Formative (1500 BC to 800 BC), the people in this widespread region buried their dead in these shaft and chamber tombs. The earliest ones are located at El Opeo in Michoacan by Lake Chapala. This cemetery consisted of simple chambers dug into the ground with a short staircase to reach them. The chamber would be sealed off and the staircase back filled. The tradition continued through the Middle Formative (800 BC to 300 BC) in places like [Mascota](http://www.famsi.org/reports/03009/03009Mountjoy01.pdf), Jalisco with simple chambers and simple vertical shafts to reach those chambers. It wasn't until the Late Formative and Early Classic periods (300 BC to 550 AD) that shaft and chamber tombs became more numerous and more elaborate. [El Arenal](http://imgur.com/a/mMrco) is the largest tomb known to date and was 17m underground with three well carved chambers dug into the soil for the dead. Unfortunately, the tomb was partially looted before Corona Nuez and a few later Stanley Long were able to document it.

Because these tombs are underground and have little to no surface indicators, almost all of the thousands of ceramic figures in museums across the globe were looted. A lot of this looting was opportunistic in which a farmer finds a depression in his field, digs down a couple of meters, robs the tomb, and sells it to someone in the city who then sells it to museums or art collectors. Some looters made it their job to go around and find these tombs using long metal bars to punch into the ground to try and find a chamber. This looting, however, is not new and has been occurring since the late 1800s. So, too, has the creation of fake ceramic figures been an industry/occupation in this region which casts doubt in the authenticity of the figures in museums today.

Because of this looting, the volume of figures, and the fact that guachimontones are not spectacularly large like pyramids in eastern Mexico or even the yacatas in Michoacan, no one really bothered to take a look any surface architectural remains. Adela Breton was the first one to [document these guachimontones](http://imgur.com/a/Cq3gv) in a letter to a friend. While she published the photo of the mound being looted (possibly an altar from a guachimonton) as well as photos and watercolors of the figures recovered from the mound, she never published her sketches of the site. As a result, the most anyone really did when documenting surface architecture was note that there were mounds. If you look at that first [picture](http://i.imgur.com/Koqc02r.jpg) in the El Arenal album, you can see the arrangement of an altar and platforms that is typical of a guachimonton. But no one recognized it as such. It wasn't until the 1970s that Phil Weigand and his wife noticed these things for what they were when they saw the guachimontones near the town of Ahualulco. Weigand and his wife did some amazing work from the 70s to the 90s doing a lot of small scale survey work, [site map drawing](http://imgur.com/a/AGQ5R), photos, surface finds, etc., but a lot of their work has remained unpublished or published in obscure sources. I had heard that Phil was ridiculed by colleagues who studied other parts of Mesoamerica saying he didn't find anything or that it wasn't important, which drove him towards publishing in obscure places or not publishing at all. He's been vindicated and was able to procure the funds to restore the Los Guachimontones site, but he did not live long enough to see the study of these structures really take off. Phil passed away in 2011 and the study of guachimontones is still trying to take off.

I was drawn to this area because of the unique structures. I thought about continuing with Maya studies in my undergrad until I learned more about the Tarascans in Michoacan. They were so different from the Aztecs and I thought that was intriguing. But then I learned about the Teuchitlan culture and was blown away by how different they were from everyone else. So part of the lack of investigation is interest. Another part has to do with colonial history. 

When the Spanish arrived in the Jalisco region, Nahuatl speakers had invaded and completely changed the region. We can pinpoint this at the end the 500s/early 600s when drought gripped the region. This same drought effected Teotihuacan and most likely drove Nahuatl speakers out of marginal areas on the border of Mesoamerica that could not continue to support agriculture. Areas like Zacatecas or Guanajuato. These people fled southward and created a ripple effect. Those that stayed behind just created more people for later migrations in Mesoamerica at the start of the Early Postclassic and Late Postclassic. The Aztecs were the third wave of migrants that occurred at the beginning of the Late Postclassic. Many of the people in the Basin of Mexico when the Aztecs arrived were second wave migrants. And the Toltecs (and maybe the Pipil of El Salvador) appear to be first wave migrants. 

But because of the drought and the influx of these migrants in Jalisco, the people stopped building guachimontones. They stopped burying their dead in shaft and chamber tombs. They stopped making ceramic figures in earlier period styles. Instead they adopted the more typical Mesoamerican monumental architecture with stepped platforms. They buried their dead in pits or box-shaped tombs. They brought in other art styles for ceramics, figures, etc. It was a complete change to the point where Epiclassic and Postclassic sites were built away from Late Formative and Classic period sites. You don't see sites with a long chronology going back from 1492 to 300 BC. You see sites that are either 1492 to 550 AD or 550 AD to 300 BC+. There's some kind of breakdown in which the people in the area were either all wiped out (unlikely) or completely rejected everything about their culture in favor of this new culture without ever revisiting their old one (loss of faith?).

When the Spanish arrived they arrived to a region made up of tiny city-states with multiple languages and multiple cultures. Sometimes these languages/cultures coexisted within one area and other times there were fierce rivalries between two neighboring towns. But because there was no large empire or state it was hard for the Spanish to control the region. The Spanish were frustrated because they wanted riches and these people did not produce riches in sufficient quantities like the Aztecs or Tarascans. So many of the Spanish resorted to legal and illegal slaving and sold many people off in the slave markets of Mexico City. Eventually a number of these groups set aside their differences, banded together, and rebelled. They used the Spaniard's own unawareness of cultures and languages to openly organize so that when they rebelled, they rebelled as one. This became the Mixton War of 1540 to 1541. Ida Altman has a [great book](https://www.amazon.com/War-Mexicos-West-Spaniards-1524-1550/dp/0826344933) on this topic. Tragically the early and successful resistance of the Natives was broken by the Spanish. And as punishment the Spanish killed many people, enslaved many more, and decimated the culture and language of these people. So we don't have things like the Florentine Codex or Relacion de Michoacan to turn to because the Spanish never bothered to document all the groups in this area as well. And when people wanted to document the cultures and languages of the past, the cultures and languages had either disappeared, were replaced with Spanish culture, or was culture brought by Aztecs, Tarascans, and Tlaxcallans that were made to settle in this now emptied region of the country.

So with not much in the way of Postclassic/contact sites to study, no pre-hispanic writing to turn to, sites that didn't fit the norm for the rest of Mesoamerica, and hard to find tombs, interest and research just hasn't been the same in West Mexico as it has in eastern Mexico.

Hopefully I can help change that. </TEXT>

The [structures](http://i.imgur.com/d69q8K8.jpg) I study in Jalisco, Mexico did not become widely recognized until the 1970s (though they were reported as eary as the 1890s). Even now, they are not widely discussed or researched

<TEXT>  How do you know those stone tools were used as sex toys? It could as well be their version of a crucifix (there are several instances of penises being religious symbols), decoration (we have examples for that too) or a joke item.

It really depends on the context in which these found, examples from the same time period, and the presence or absence of use-wear. Not everything can be boiled down to religion. If these bronze phalluses show use-wear (i.e. polishing) it may very well have been practical items rather than symbolic items. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Most Native Americans, especially pre-Columbus, were still semi-nomadic hunter/gathering societies that relied directly on their environment.

Most Natives were agriculturalists, not hunter-gatherers.

 In the more semi-arid regions, such as the American south west, the people had to adapt to their surroundings and anthropological records show that their diets consisted more of small game and seeds/berries

American Southwest Natives farmed. There is an extensive system of irrigation canals where Phoenix is today. The people at Mesa Verde constructed breaks on the plateau their cliff dwellings were built into in order to capture and retain water for farming.

 the people living in the Great Plains, or more fertile areas, were found to have lived off of big game and more sustainable flora.

The Plains peoples were hunter-gatherers and some groups in the Pacific Northwest and California were, as well. But up and down the Mississippi, the Southeast, Appalachia, and the Northeast the people were farmers. The farmers may have supplemented their farming with hunting and gathering, but it does not make them hunter-gatherers. Would you characterize Americans in the 1700s who had a farm and supplemented their farming with hunting and gathering as hunter-gatherers? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's possible. But the only places I know of that were using metallurgy at this time are in Central or South America. Central and South America have been hypothesized as the locations from where metallurgy spread to Mesoamerica, but I am not aware of any hard physical proof linking the two areas together. There is circumstantial evidence in the form of bell shape (and I think tweezers shape), but nothing from Central/South America in origin found in Mexico. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Around the Great Lakes for sure, not sure about anywhere else. And that was 6,000 to 3,000 years ago. I haven't heard of any native copper working in Mesoamerica prior to 600 AD. That's why it surprised me. Perhaps /u/Ucumu can chime in, he knows more about metallurgy than I.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So Im reading the chapter The Shaft Tombs of Parcelas 12, 19, and 25 and their Inhabitants: Funerary Considerations of the Recent Archaeological Finds in Colima by Marcos Trinidad Zavaleta Lucido and Rosa Mara Flores Ramrez in *Shaft Tombs and Figures in West Mexican Society: A Reassessment* (2016). On page 67 they are discussing the remains found in a shaft tomb that dates to the Comala phase (0 AD to 400 AD). This is what they say,

 Likewise some of the bones showed the remains of red pigment and of adhered metal, surely from the copper beads that were found in the interior of the tomb.1

What, what, WHAT?! Copper beads in the tomb?! But metallurgy wasnt introduced to Mesoamerica until sometime after 600 AD. But they had a note! And the note says,

 Even though the a remains recovered from the interior of the tomb indicate that it was utilized solely in the Comala phase, it is not possible to rule out a later reuse of the tomb during this phase or that the offerings were deposited at the same time, until other tests, such as residual collagen, are carried out.

So its possible the copper beads are from a later period. But then, it looks like they may in fact be from the same period as the tombs. Thats a big find despite the brief description. I think Zavaleta and Flores are waiting on those tests to confirm the dates of the tomb before making the big announcement. Im sure they are going to get some push back for their findings, but I hope their evidence holds up. I had an inkling that someone was going to find metal in a shaft tomb at some point, I just didn't think it was going to be so soon. I'm going to keep my eyes peeled for their publication on these beads because I think it is going to be huge. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How much looting is done/abetted by locals in that area?

It's dropped off since the 70s, but still occurs from time to time.

 looters being local to the site they're looting

I think they were local to the region with people going around Nayarit, Colima, and Jalisco

 I also don't think looters would take the time to look up images just because they've not been looted yet when as you say Google Earth can help you incorporate so many factors so easily to find potential areas.

Perhaps. But if money is tight and you need the cash, you may do a little research before you go out looting.

 The kid "finding a lost Maya city" points out the other problem, that satellite images only identify anomalies and do not help interpret them. Parcak's attempts at finding a Viking site faced the same criticism that the evidence for the site dating to that time period was only circumstantial.

Yeah, I've got 50 or so pushpins on Earth of things I think are buildings, but I'm waiting to ground truth them at some point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, Aztecs are Native Americans. Any peoples living in the Americas before 1492 or descended from Native peoples and are living today are Native Americans. I'm only speculating, but your co-working may have a certain perception of what constitutes Native Americans based on media portrayal. Many people think of Plains peoples who used horses to raid American towns and forts and fight the Union army, like the Comanche or Apache, as the only kind of Native American since they are commonly portrayed in Old West films. There is, in fact, a wide range of Native peoples who all lived many different lifestyles before and after the arrival of Europeans. Many of them were agriculturalists who made no use of the horse since the horse had not lived in the Americas for several tens of thousand years before their reintroduction by European conquerors after 1492. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I somewhat disagree with the term collapse, but that comes from having read Tainter's and Mcanany and Yoffee's work on collapses and what it truly means. I am intrigued by Inomata and his team's dates which chronicle the site history of Ceibal. Inomata has done some great work on Middle Preclassic Ceibal and I don't doubt that he has done great work with this topic as well. I do wonder how these radiocarbon dates will shift the discussion on collapses and what they mean. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if anyone else has except Thompson and now Miller and Coe.

While this could very well be an ambitious forgery, I think it passes too many criteria to be a forgery. Between the age of the paper, the method of construction, the method of decorating, the iconography, and the paint used, to me it is authentic. For a forger to do all that they would have had intimate access to a real codex, know of iconography before anyone else, have found blank pre-columbian paper that dated to the correct time period, and know what it meant and how to use it, and have figured out Maya Blue without telling anyone.

<TEXT> They are. The wiki article on the Dresden says that it could be a copy of an earlier codex. 

It could also simply be artistic choice to include a more Central Mexican art style than a Maya. It may have been thought of as foreign and exotic and thus had more power and prestige. But I'm just guessing. If artwork was the basis for establishing empires, than the Aztatlan culture of Nayarit created an empire reaching Oaxaca and Puebla since the Mixteca-Puebla style appears earlier in Nayarit than in Central Mexico. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know of Mayapan and some of its history. I just haven't seen much of its art or artifacts. Marilyn Masson was one of my professors in undergrad and she told me plenty of the city. We just never discussed the artwork.

She once told me that people call Mayapan a knockoff because of two reasons. The first, Mayapan's Castillo and Caracol are smaller. The second, Mayapan looks worse than Chichen. I don't recall her discussing why the size was smaller, but she did discuss why its appearance was worse. Chichen was built with cut stone and very little of it was plastered over. Mayapan, however, went back to using plaster to covers its buildings and thus did not need to invest in the time and labor for cut stone. She thought it was unfair to call Mayapan a knockoff just based on its appearance.

Somewhat related, the main pyramid for the Itza Maya of Nojpeten supposedly looked like the Castillo from Chichen and Mayapan. </TEXT>

The Maya Long Count, the calendar people were obsessed with, doesn't end. It counts up from the point of creation, not down to a point of destruction. It is made up of five different cycles of days. One of those cycles was like our millennium and it was completed in 2012. We are now in a new cycle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Native Americans do have a "European" component to their DNA that is very ancient. I say European because it shows up in modern populations. However, that same component has been found in Siberians and Siberian remains that are thousands of years old. Since Siberians are the closest related populations to Natives, this suggests that there was a split sometime in the Old World before people reached Siberia. One group went northwest to Europe, the other continued northeast to Siberia.

Native Americans also have traces of Denisovan DNA which suggests that their Old World ancestors had some intimate interaction before reaching the New World. Europeans have almost no Denisovan DNA. </TEXT>

I guess McGovern gave the details of a residue analysis to some brewers who wanted to recreate the 3,500 year old distilled drink and this action was a big no-no. I have written about Daniel Zizumbo-Villarreal et. al.'s 2009 study [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3dynjb/what_kinds_of_alcoholic_beverages_did_the_native/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2z0p4w/saturday_reading_and_research_march_14_2015/cpeo5r7/?context=3) if you are interested. While I found the experimentation fascinating, I was hesitant to charge forth proclaiming that the Capacha culture actually had distilled spirits without any sort of residue analysis. But if McGovern, Colunga, Zizumbo-Villarreal, and Gonzlez did do the tests and did find evidence, this does change our understanding of alcoholic beverages in Mesoamerica. And it makes me question whether the [claims](http://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/mezcals-history-is-older-than-thought/) of distillation by two researchers working in Oaxaca are not so far-fetched as I first thought. Hopefully when all this mess between McGovern, Colunga, Zizumbo-Villarreal, and Gonzlez is sorted out, we can get our hands on a published article of the results to judge for ourselves whether the claim for distillation holds true or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And if you scroll down a bit further you get this,

 The terms "Stone Age", "Bronze Age", and "Iron Age" were never meant to suggest that advancement and time periods in prehistory are only measured by the type of tool material, rather than, for example, social organization, food sources exploited, adaptation to climate, adoption of agriculture, cooking, settlement and religion. Like pottery, the typology of the stone tools combined with the relative sequence of the types in various regions provide a chronological framework for the evolution of man and society. They serve as diagnostics of date, rather than characterizing the people or the society. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  That seems less likely to me. Why don't these populations show up in the genetics of native north Americans?

Maybe they do. I'm not a geneticist. All I know is that all Native Americans, North and South, have their strongest roots in Siberia. I also know that minor genetic markers today were once [more widespread](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/11/inca-child-mummy-reveals-lost-genetic-history-south-america) in the past. Unfortunately Europeans brought diseases that wiped out a lot of genetic diversity in the Americas. 

 We already know that people in the ice age were capable of sea voyages due to the date that humans arrived in Australia and other pieces of evidence.

The Solutrean Hypothesis is refuted by the huge gap in time between the Solutrean culture in France and the Clovis culture in the Americas, the lack of evidence for watercraft, the difficulty in the route, and the mountain of genetic evidence that point to Siberia and Asia as the origin of Native Americans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Inca had roads, but not quite the same as Maya roads. Inca roads were not flat or very broad. They followed mountain sides and made a lot of turns. Inca roads were paved with cut stone.

Maya roads were flat, long, did not rise or lower, and very rarely turned. Maya roads were made from earth and rocks and paved with plaster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ~6000 km2

I study the Teuchitlan culture of Jalisco, Mexico. The Teuchitlan culture, as well as their contemporaries in Nayarit, Colima, and northern Jalisco, have a tradition of burying their dead in shaft and chamber tombs. These tombs can range from very small chambers just below the surface to large multi-chambered tombs as deep as 18m. Since the late 1800s up through the 1960s and 1970s, looting was very frequent. In fact, some people made their livelihood just looting tombs. As a result, the number of tombs that have been studied by archaeologists are few and far between. I'm on the lookout to see whether there have been advances in technology that allow us to find some unlooted tombs in a very large area. The 6000 km2 area I gave covers the entirety of the Tequila Valleys where the Teuchitlan culture is centered upon. In reality, if I wanted to search all of western Mexico the area would be much, much higher. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The potatoes eaten by Native Americans had thousands of years of selective breeding to reduce toxins. And empires were built on the consumption of potatoes and other tubers from the Andes. So how is it that these things could happen in the Andes, but the potato was somehow too poisonous for Europeans until they did their own selective breeding? 

I would like a source on the claim that potatoes were used to poison people.

I'm not denying that potatoes can be poisonous, because they can. But you would think Europeans would look at how Natives consumed potatoes and copy them the same way Europeans did with other New World foods. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  what? how is that relevant? 

Because you seem to not understand how radiocarbon dating works and how archaeologists arrive at the dates they present.

 if i didnt build the house 100 years ago but everything from the original builders was washed away you would assume that i built it. and you would be wrong.

No, I wouldn't. Not everything washes away and if it did, that would mean evidence of your occupation would be gone as well.

Plus, depending on how well preserved the house is you can date the structure based on style and construction material choice. You can then compare these things to other structures that have been dated and make a comparison.

  i didnt make any assumptions about the hunter gatherers. im saying they wouldn't have built it. there is no reason for them to have built it. 

You are in thinking that they didn't built Gobekli Tepe and had no reason to construct it.

 and there is no evidence they built it.

The excavators seem to have evidence it was hunter-gatherers.

 its a matter of belief. and i dont care about belief. i care about truth. im not interested in people making wild rationalizations just to suit their view of history.

But you're supporting Hancock and his beliefs. There's a bit of irony there, don't you think?

 well why arent you wondering if they did or not? because there is still no good evidence that they did.

jfc the pyramid exists so people built it. Who else would have done it? And if not Egyptians that had the people, food, and infrastructure to construct the pyramid, why would even earlier people build a pyramid?

 i mean the story goes that the king wanted a giant pyramid to be burred in and then for 20 years slaves built a structure

Yeah, that's a story. The reality is that slaves did not build the Great Pyramids. Rather, skilled and paid masons constructed the pyramid. This is based on excavations of the homes of the workers found near the pyramids.

  built a structure that would be totally ruined if even one stone was out of place.

The pyramid isn't some kind of house of cards. There are numerous missing stones from the exterior of the pyramid today and the structure has not collapsed.

 somehow the workers didnt revolt in those 20 years.

Why would you if you're getting paid?

 why build it in the first place?

Because pyramids stemmed from mastabas which were places Egyptians buried the dead. The Pyramids also signal and establish power and authority. Later pyramids were smaller and required less work because the pharaohs had little need to signal the power they already had.

 why three of them?

Why not? If you are trying to establish a dynasty and secure your power, you build big until it is secure.

 why did we stop building megaliths all of the sudden and seemingly forgot how to do it after making them all over the place for thousands of years?

Cost/benefit, to be honest. Because it is more costly to build with megalithic blocks it signals power and authority. As cultures changed and the methods to signal power and authority changed, there was no need to expand the labor, time, and cost on megalithic structures.

 did we get too sophisticated to do the most sophisticated thing we've ever done

It's not that sophisticated. You're basically building with large Legos. 

 why are some under water?

Like what? The geological formation off of Japan?

 again i think you let someone else do you thinking for you. theres no way you can look at the official story and not question the shit out of all of it.

Do you see the irony in your statement? You reject the plausible and fact based hypotheses for these things for an alternative explanation with little to no evidence and do not question the alternative explanation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are right that parts of the plant are poisonous. The only poisonous parts of the plant are the flowers, leaves, temps, and skin of the tuber. The flesh of the tuber itself is safe to eat. And wild varieties are more toxic than domesticated. However, cooking the potato at a temperature greater than 170 C does partly destroy the toxins. 

According to Sophie Coe and her book *America's First Cuisines*, Europeans were slow to adopt the potato because it was not suited to the longer summer days of Europe. While in Ireland, which had a milder climate that allowed the potato to grow until November, the potato underwent a change that allowed it to grow in other parts of Europe. This change may have stemmed from selective breeding or the introduction of other varieties from Chile. It wasn't until the eighteenth century that the potato was productive enough to gain widespread use in Europe. She does not mention toxicity as an issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  ok so they refute two points out of many made by Randal Carlson and others. so must not be true?

No, but it is a shaky foundation.

 and carbon dating things around the pyramid makes no sense. ok so i move into a house made from stone that was built 300 years ago and you come and carbon date things i left behind 100 years ago when i lived there and assume its a hundred years old? come on.

You do not just carbon date one source, you date multiple sources from multiple contexts to piece together a timeline of occupation. You are also assuming you will leave behind no other organic material that can be dated other than said hypothetical material when you move out. If you make a campfire in your yard, garden, toss some garbage on the side of the house, etc. that all could possibly be found.

I should point out, however, our modern practice of gathering refuse to have it deposited elsewhere is a recent thing. In the past, people would have had a midden in which they dumped all their garbage and waste.

 this is kind of gettin into Occam's razor territory. imo its far simpler to assume there was some sort of semi advanced civilization and then something happened which restarted civilization than to say hunter gatherers spontaneously organized a work force to build a monument for some reason and then purposefully covered it up. and then they didn't build any other megalithic sites for thousands of years. it doesn't make any sense. and they were able to feed and house this workforce in a desert how?

I think the trouble you are having in understanding where I am coming from is based on some faulty assumptions. You assume that hunter-gatherers cannot and did not store food. Looking to contemporary hunter-gatherers will not aid you because these people live in marginal areas already. You don't see modern hunter-gatherers in fertile areas with abundant resources because they've been driven off.

You also assume that they spontaneously came out of nowhere to build Gobekli Tepi. The site itself was constructed over a period of 1760 years (radiocarbon dates range from 9130 BC at the oldest to 7370 BC at the youngest). That is a lot of time to come together to slowly work on and construct the site in piecemeal.

You also assume that being a hunter-gatherer means you are constantly on the move. Hunter-gatherers are not inherently nomadic, or at least not constantly nomadic. Hunter-gatherers may move from village to village every few years or decades as they depleted the sources in that particular area and moved onto more abundant regions.

Lastly, you assume that the climate of where Gobekli Tepe is located in Turkey now is how the climate has always been. The climate across the globe is very different now than in the past. What may be desert like now, was not always desert. The best example is the Middle East which used to be much more fertile at the time of Mesopotamia than it is now.

Take all of these things and there is no reason that a large group of hunter-gatherers camped nearby could not have worked together to construct Gobekli Tepi over even a few decades let alone centuries using food stored from throughout the year. They could have also continued to hunt and gather part time or on a rotation basis to help support the community.

 it cant be that maybe we dont have all the pieces of the puzzle yet right?

Sure, that is always a possibility. But as it stands right now with the available evidence, Hancock's ideas lack concrete support.

 but there isnt alot of evidence that man even had the capability of building the site at giza.

They most certainly did. The debate isn't whether people could carve the blocks and move them into place to create the Great Pyramids. The fact that they stand there today is evident of that. The debate is in the exact construction method to build the pyramid. Did they use a ramp? Several ramps? An internal ramp? Log rollers? Moistened sand? Teams of people? Any animals? That's the debate. It's trying to figure out exactly what they did, not whether they did or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  these are blocks that were cut out and then had 3d relief hieroglyphs carved on them. not the same thing.

I didn't say it was the same thing, I was saying that PP took a huge amount of effort for a group of hunter-gatherers. Possibly more effort than Gobekli Tepe depending on where the stone is sourced from.

 the idea is that we were hit by an asteroid. what kind of permanent settlements would you expect to see?

The comet? That idea has been refuted. 

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/12/161219115304.htm

And even if we were, I would only expect small hamlets at the most 12,000 years ago.

 which animals. well i happen to have the paper right here. http://www.exoriente.org/docs/00046.pdf

I didn't see any animals that should not have been there. Mind telling me which ones specifically?

 because apparently they would ruin the site. which is a ridiculous excuse.

It's not ridiculous. Ruins are not inherently stable to allow for excavation. That's why little work is conducted on the Great Pyramid of Cholula.

  and they dont know for sure its 28 thousand years old. they suspect it is.

Ah, there's the crux. So no actual hard evidence for the claim.

 ok so whats the supporting evidence that the pyramids were built when they say they were built?

Which ones? The Great Pyramids of Giza? My guess would be radiocarbon dates from activity areas that correspond to construction activities for the pyramids. Like charcoal from the hearts of the homes the workers were housed in.

 and no one is saying that this civilization was global. actually hancock never says much of anything about the civilization.

I thought that is what he talked about in Fingerprints. 

 gobecli tepe was the first strange find that doesnt fit the narrative.

You're right, it is odd. But it doesn't upend everything we know about the preceding period of human history. There's still no evidence of advanced civilizations in the Ice Age. What we do see are hunter-gatherers.

 you can believe that hunter gatherers built it alllll you want.

The excavators of Gobekli Tepi believe this and they excavated the site. Who is Hancock to come in and say otherwise? Especially when he does no excavations himself.

 ohh and the place in india isnt in india at all. Indonesia. gunung padang. thats my bad.

Oh yeah, that place. I've never been able to find an English article discussing the dating of the site. There are some articles in Indonesian, but I can't read that and don't know what they are saying. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  poverty point doesnt have megalithic blocks with 3d relief. 

Mound A by itself is 238,000 cubic meters of fill. Do you think that is easy to collect, move, and construct? Easier than erecting a few megalithic blocks? Easter Islanders created a bunch of stone heads and moved them around their island, but no one is claiming they are a global civilization.

 i guess if you believe that hunter gatherers made it i dont know what to tell you otherwise. but its not a fact. its not backed by evidence. but im guessing you think it is.

What's the evidence? Where are the permanent settlements around Gobekli Tepe?

 no because it depicts the exact same symbolism. lots of the same animals are depicted there. animals that according to the current theory shouldnt have existed there at the time. unless they did exist there at the time and a cataclysm made them all go extinct.

Humanity has a fascination with animals. We use to live around them much more than we do now. How can you not depict animals in artwork? 

And which shared symbolism? And to who? Which animals shouldn't have existed at that time?  I'm asking because I want you to think about this

 nothing dubious about it. its there. and they know for sure that there is a chamber in the center of it. just like the pyramids of giza.

But where is it? Who is excavating it? And how did they arrive at their date of construction?

 ok but humanity doesnt live under water. where i just said the structures were found. from shore means water, not inland. im not even sure what you are trying to say tbh.

One of Hancock's ideas is that his supposed global civilization was wiped away when the ocean levels rose because they lived on the coast.

 ive heard this a million times. so and so are hacks because i dont believe their theory and they sell books. there isnt alot to cite because the work is slow to get done

What about in places where a lot of work has been done? He purposely avoids more recent published works on Tiwanaku, for example.

 both india and turkey dig teams keep getting blocked. 

By who? And for what reason? If someone found a 28,000 year old pyramid you should bet your bottom dollar they would get all the funding they need, exclusive publishing rights, and work towards turning the structure into a tourist attraction. Archaeologists scoop each other for small bits of research. Why would they not scoop someone for finding something so profound? Especially if it means securing tenure and funding?

 more and more mainstream scientists (not amatuers) are saying civilization is older than we thought.

Things about humanity are older, not civilization itself. Civilization implies a cohesive culture with identifiable material culture. Finding one site with early megalithic construction and another completely different site in which people used wild oats to make flour (for example) are two completely different and independant things. And I hate to say it, but unless these other scientists are archaeologists they really do not have the expertise or knowledge to make such a statement.

 im not really sure why people are so quick to dismiss this theory.

Because it isn't a theory, but a hypothesis with poor supporting evidence.

 but im willing to bet its because you let someone do you thinking for you as i said before.

Says the guy who is blindly following what Hancock has written. I always question what people have written. Even those in my own field. Even my own graduate advisor. It's good to question and it's good to test the evidence and hypotheses of authors. And frankly, Hancock's evidence and hypotheses don't hold up to scrutiny and question. That's why he creates his persecution complex by saying mainstream science wants to silence him. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  gobekli tepe is 12000 years old at the least. and its a megalithic site.

Yes, but it is not a city nor is it even a town, village, or hamlet. The structures are ceremonial. And while it may have taken a lot of effort for hunter-gatherers or proto-agriculturalists to construct, creating large monument architecture is not impossible for hunter-gatherers. Poverty Point in Louisiana is a great example for this despite PP being earthen rather than stone blocks. The shear size and volume of PP is nothing to sneeze at.

 much of whats found there looks exactly like sites found all over the world.

How so? Because it is a building? Because people sometimes build round structures?

 india there is a massive pyramid buried that could be 28 thousand years oil. they are still diggin that one. cant remeber the name of it right now. 

Sounds dubious.

 in the same area there are structures 5+km from shore. places that were above sea level 12 thousand years ago.

Fun fact: humanity does not live exclusively by the coast. You cannot get all the resources you may need or want by living on the coast. That necessitates living inland. And if you have a massive global coastal civilization you're going to leave behind evidence of resource extraction in the interior. And frankly, there is zero evidence of that.

 before calling someone a hack (presumably because someone else does your thinking for you) maybe do some actual research.

Perhaps you should turn a critical eye towards Hancock's citations. He'll cite material from amateur archaeologists from the 1920s (out of date, poor methodology) or even travel pamphlets. Like I said, he picks and chooses his information to support his narrative. He's not a rebel trying to go against mainstream archaeology, he's a con man preying upon those that can be swindled into buying his books. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One I encounter a lot is people thinking the Maya civilization collapsed at the end of the Classic period (~900 AD) and the people who survived just sort of faded into the jungle.

The reality is that while there was a major socio-political upheaval towards the end of the Classic and into the Postclassic with cities in Peten region being abandoned, not all cities were abandoned. In fact, some Classic period cities grew in size and became regional centers in their own right. Or cities that were abandoned in the Early Classic were reoccupied at the end of the Classic/Early Postclassic. Some cities, like Uxmal and Mayapan, were constructed in the Postclassic with little to no Classic period roots.

When the Spanish came in the 1500s they hard a very difficult time pacifying the area. Because the Maya were just a collection of city-states rather than one single political entity, as soon as the Spanish conquered one city all of the nearby cities would rise up. Even formerly conquered places would rise up as soon as the Spanish moved. I think if Mayapan had not been abandoned in the 1480s because of a civil war between the Xiu and Cocom family, a much stronger resistance could have been made against the Spanish. Alas, we'll never know.

One fact I like to tell people who think the Maya were easily conquered or were just people eking out an existence in the jungle is that the last Maya kingdom to be conquered was not conquered until 1697. This kingdom, centered on the city of Nojpeten, was ruled by the Itza Maya. For decades they would routinely incite rebellion in Spanish controlled regions from their fortified island city in the Peten. The Spanish actually had plans to leave the Itza alone because they thought they would be too difficult to conquer. The Spanish had control of northern Yucatan and southern Guatemala and at the time saw no need to go further. Unfortunately a young Spaniard by the name of Martn de Ursa y Arizmendi wanted to relive the glory days of his conquistador ancestors. So he petitioned the crown to be allowed to make a royal road (camino royal) from Merida to Guatemala. When the Itza Maya and their allies attacked the road builders, Ursua used this as justification to begin a campaign of conquest. We could have had an independent indigenous state if it were not for him. </TEXT>

Haha, what? Nhuatl didn't really enter Mesoamerica until after the Classic period (the golden age that wasn't really a golden age). Proto-Nahuatl would be something that is thousands of years ago, long before Nhuatl came into the Maya region.

And they didn't coexist with the Aztec in some kind of mutual harmonious relationship. The Aztecs were actually making moves to conquer some of the Maya city-states before Cortes showed up. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The Maya as one of the earliest advanced civilizations (5000 years ago) 

They were still largely hunter-gatherers in 3,000 BC. What would constitute advanced to you at this point in time? I mean 3000 BC is before the Olmec even

 used Psilocybe mexicana

Sources?

 which they called teonanacatl (flesh of the gods)

That's Nhuatl, not Mayan. You know those are different languages, yeah?

 They also used Salvia and Morning Glory (known as ololiuqui).

Sources?

 While they knew about alcohol and tobacco, these entheogens were preferred and used more commonly.

Sources? Because the Maya loved alcohol and tobacco

 The aztecs did the same.

Sources?

 The Inca had Coca plants; they chewed the leaves to work for much longer and the messengers used them to travel much further to deliver the messages faster between cities. They also used Ayahuasca, but this was mostly only for the priests at ceremonies.

Again, sources? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is younger, yes, but it still shows that Native Americans have a genetic link to the Bering Strait and to Siberia. 

Raghaven doesn't contrifict anything. Raghaven argues the window was between 23,000 years and 8,000 years ago. This lines up with linguistic and genetic models linking paleoindians to Siberians. And it lines up with the findings found in Alaska presented in the paper. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In other words, it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the peopling of the Americas.

It does, actually. What these researchers thought were twins were actually two different kids. Both of their genomes are present in Native populations and one of them was thought to have arrived later. The finding shows that it didn't arrive later, but is absent from northern populations likely due to migration and genetic drift which fits with current models.

<TEXT> Polynesians didn't start migrating until 3000 BC, though. And they didn't reach Hawaii and Easter Island until after 1000 AD. So they probably played little to no role in the Americas.

As for the Ainu, in what way would they have influenced Native peoples? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is really no evidence of giants. All of the claims of giants come from the 19th century and since that time no one has discovered a giant. You would think that even with all the salvage archaeological work conducted, all of construction work, any time someone digs into the ground, someone should have found a skeleton and should have said something to someone. But no one has because there were no giants. Not only has no one found any skeletons, no one has found their villages, homes, tools, ceramics, or any other physical evidence to suggest it was for giants. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dr. Guidon's idea of people traveling by boat from Africa to the Americas 100,000 years ago is unfounded and lacks concrete evidence.

However, the leading hypothesis for the rapid spread of people in the Americas is thought to have been by boats hugging the coast as they made their way southward from the Bering Straight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To copy/paste an answer I gave previously on /r/AskHistorians

 There's a number of factors that can contribute to this answer and the debate has raged on for 100 years. Factors such as population density and a dwindling food supply are often mentioned, but I am of the mind that it was the weather. Up until 12,000 years ago the climate around the world fluctuated from hot to cold and back again in intervals as small as a decade in some cases. This makes it extremely difficult to cultivate plants to grow in a certain climate if the climate is never stable. 12,000 years ago marks the Holocene and we have had a relatively stable climate that allowed people to settle down and begin farming. Whether that is, in fact, the case or not is still up for debate but the fact remains that people just were not able to farm before the Holocene.

 [Richerson, Peter J., Robert Boyd, and Robert L. Bettinger
2001, Was Agriculture Impossible During the Pleistocene But Mandatory During the Holocene? A Climate Change Hypothesis. American Antiquity 66(3):387-411.](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/AgOrigins_2_12_01.pdf)

To quote the source cited 

 "Might we not expect agriculture to have emerged in the last interglacial 130,000 years ago or even during one of the older interglacials? No archaeological evidence has come to light suggesting the presence of technologies that might be expected to accompany forays into intensive plant collecting or agriculture at this time. Anatomically modern humans may have appeared in Africa as early as 130,000 years ago, but they were not behaviorally modern. Humans of the last interglacial were uniformly archaic in behavior. Very likely, then, the humans of the last interglacial were neither cognitively nor culturally capable of evolving agricultural subsistence. However, climate might also explain the lack of marked subsistence intensification during previous interglacials. Ice cores from the thick Antarctic ice cap at Vostok show that each of the last four interglacials over the last 420,000 years were characteristic by a short, sharp peak of warmth rather than the 11,600 year long stable plateau of the Holocene. Further, the GRIP ice core suggests the last interglacial (130,000-80,000 BP) was more variable than the Holocene, although its lack of agreement with a nearby replicate for for this time period makes this interpretation tenuous. On the other than, the atmospheric concentration of C02 was higher in the three previous interglacials than during the Holocene, and was stable at high levels for about 20,000 years following the warm peak during the last interglacial. The highly continental Vostok site unfortunately does not record the same high-frequency variation in the climate as most other proxy climate records, even those in the southern hemisphere. Some northern hemisphere marine and terrestrial records suggest that the last interglacial was highly variable while other data suggest a Holocene-length period of stable climates ca. 127,000-117,000 BP. Better data on the high frequency part of the Pleistocene beyond the reach of the Greenland ice cores is needed to test hypotheses about events antedating the latest Pleistocene. Long marine cores from areas of rapid sediment accumulation are beginning to reveal the millennial scale record from previous glacial-interglacial cycles. At least the last five glacials have millennial-scale variations like the last glacial. The degree of fluctuations during previous interglacials is still not clear, but at least some proxy data suggest that the Holocene has been less variable than earlier interglacials." </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There is very strong evidence for North-West Alaska being the initial entry point for humanity in to the Americas, people might not have walked and used boats instead though.

Yeah, that's not up for debate in archaeology. What is up for debate is timing and method of moving. As you said, boats may have been used.

 What are most probably arrowheads (too small for spear or javelin-heads) have been found, embedded in humans remains, around lake Turkana dating back to the early Holocene, pretty much around the initial migrations in to the Americas.

Turkana is a long way from the Americas. Evidence for the bow in the Americas first pops up just a few thousand years ago. Mesoamerica, for example, did not get the bow until sometime after 600 AD. That being said, smaller projectile points could be from atlatl darts or blowgun darts. </TEXT>

I've never actually sat down and read the entire Florentine Codex, only parts. So I thought this would be a fun thing to add with the artifacts, news stories, and other things I share. Please excuse any typos I may have made copying the chapters. If you catch any, let me know.

So far, I've only done eighteen chapters from Book 1

<TITLE> Twelfth Night Cake from from Richard Brigg's 1788 cookbook, "The English Art of Cookery." </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-28 14:57:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I follow the 18th century cooking channel on YouTube because I really enjoy seeing all those recipes from a few hundred years ago. I decided that for Christmas I would make the Twelfth Night Cake they featured in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS1CQlacX2U) video.

The only things I changed from their recipe was not using citron and increasing the amount of candied orange and lemon by 1/8 of a cup as well as using a metal cake ring since I could not find a wooden one. I also baked the cake at an hour and a half rather than the two hours they needed with their wooden cake ring. I think I should have baked it for an hour twenty instead since the the bottom was a little brown and hard.

[This was the result](http://i.imgur.com/zhg1l9e.jpg). Unfortunately I did not snap any pictures of the inside. It was scarfed up at Christmas dinner by my family. They all said it was amazing and I agree, it turned out really well.

Recipe transcribed from the video,

1 pound butter

1/2 pound sugar

8 eggs, separated

3 cups flour

3/4 each teaspoon mace and nutmeg

1/2 cup brandy

1/4 cup each candied orange, lemon, and citron rind

1 cup slivered almonds

1 pound zante currants

Instructions. Get a partner to help

1. Get all your ingredients out on the table and ready

2. Line a 9 inch cake ring with buttered parchment paper on bottom and sides. Tie parchment to ring for the bottom if needed

3. Combine flour with mace and nutmeg

4. Combine currants, candied rind, almonds, and brandy

5. Cream butter, then add sugar and continue to cream

6. Whisk egg whites until stiff peaks form

7. Whisk egg yolks until thick

8. Combine creamed butter and sugar with whisked egg whites and yolks. 

9. Slowly add flour to butter and egg mixture mixing constantly until all the flour is combined

10. Stir in the sweetmeats

11. Bake at 350 F for about 80 minutes with a metal cake ring, 120 minutes for a wooden one

12. Remove from cake ring and let cool </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you use Tumblr or Instagram, I just wanted to let you know that I will be sharing a new chapter of the Florentine Codex each day. I've never actually sat down and read the entire Florentine Codex, only parts. So I thought this would be a fun thing to add with the artifacts, news stories, and other things I share on Tumblr and Instagram.

So far, I've only done four chapters and I started with Book 1 if you are interested.

 the Olmecs, the oldest culture in Mesoamerica

There are several cultures that are older or contemporaneous to the Olmec. The Mokaya (Blake and Clark 1999), Capacha (Kelly 1980; Mountjoy 1994) , Matanchen (Mountjoy 1970, 2000; Mountjoy and Claassen 2005), El Opeo (Oliveros 1970, 1974), and Monte Alto cultures (Parsons and Jenson 1965; Demarest, Switsur, and Berger 1982), for example.

 Olmecs settled along the Gulf of Mexico and began building great cities of stone and brick. 

They had dirt mounds (Cyphers 1997; Diehl 981). The Red Palace has some basalt columns, but most of it is dirt.

 Though no one knows where the Olmecs came from, nor what happened to them, they lay the foundation for all the future civilizations in Mesoamerica.

They came from Archaic populations in the region (Wilkerson 1981). They are the culmination of centuries of cultural development in the region. They didn't come from anywhere else but where they already lived.

As for where they went, they continued to develop culturally and became the Epi-Olmec (Pool 2000).

They also did not lay down the foundation for all Mesoamerican civilizations. West Mexican civilizations, for example, diverge greatly from their eastern cousins. There is little to no Olmec material that has been recovered in West Mexico despite no physical barriers preventing people from moving and trading. West Mexico simply drew upon their own ancestral cultures such as Capacha and El Opeo.

 important cultural elements of the region were disseminated such as writing, mathematics, astronomy and the development of the calendar; all of which the Maya would refine.

It's somewhat debatable since the Olmec didn't write any of this. There's the Cascajal Block, but it hasn't been confirmed to be writing exactly. It could be writing, looks like writing to some, but cannot be read (Magni 2008). And it looks very different from Zapotec, Maya, or Epi-Olmec writing. The oldest Long Count date comes from Tres Zapotes, that's true, but it dates to the Late Formative long after what we would consider Olmec.

 The Plumed Serpent god  Kukulkan (also known as Gucamatz) was the most popular deity among the Maya. 

We don't refer to the feathered serpent at Teotihuacan as Quetzalcoatl or Kukulkan because we don't know what Teotihuacanos called it. How is the feather serpent the consort of the Goddess? Where has that been established?

 During this time the great urban centers rose across the land and the Maya numbered in the millions

You put this in the El Tajin section, but mention the Maya. The Maya did not inhabit El Tajin. And you need to provide a source on the population estimate if you're going to say millions.

 The very important ball game which came to be known as Poc-a-Toc was developed and more ball courts have been found in and around the city of El Tajin than anywhere else in the region. 

While El Tajin may have had its own variation of the Mesoamerican ball game, keep in mind that ball courts have been found that predate El Tajin. The Teuchitlan culture, for example, built ballcourts beginning in the Late Formative to Early Classic periods. 

 The Classic Maya Period: 250-950 CE  This is the era which saw the consolidation of power in the great cities of the Yucatec Maya such as Chichen Itza and Uxmal. 

You should make a note that both Chichen Itza and Uxmal were founded in the Late Classic (600 AD, Chichen - 850 AD - Uxmal) and survived until the early Postclassic (13th century, Chichen - 1100 AD, Uxmal)
        
 Direct cultural influences may be seen, in some sites, from the Olmecs and the Zapotecs and the cultural values of Teotihuacan and El Tajin

What are these influences? You need to establish that. Especially with the Zapotec, El Tajin, and Olmec.

 This period was the height of the Maya civilization in which they perfected mathematics, astronomy, architecture and the visual arts and also refined and perfected the calendar.

How did they perfect these things? And how did they differ from the Preclassic? Or Postclassic?

 The oldest date recorded in this era is on Stele 29 in the city of Tikal (292 CE)

El Bal (Ochoa and Lee 1983; Marcus 1976) and Takalik Abaj (Riese 1988; Stuart 2004) both have older dates and both are Maya

 The Post-Classic Period: 950-1524 CE  At this time the great cities of the Maya were abandoned.

Some were, some weren't. The Postclassic thrived, as well (Chase 1992; Chase and Chase 2006; Masson, Hare, and Peraza Lope 2006; Sabloff 2007; Jones 1998). It may not be as well known and published as the Classic period, but it is just as important if not more so since the Postclassic Maya were who the Spanish encountered

 The Toltecs, a new tribe in the region, took over the vacant urban centers and re-populated them. At this time, Tula and Chichen-Itza became dominant cities in the region.

The Toltecs were not in the Maya region. And they did not "take over" anything. The topic is still hotly debated and part of it is because there is this is a common misconception based on early archaeological work where people visited Tula before they visited Chichen. They saw some similarities between the two and concluded Tula influenced Chichen, but did so without any sort of dating. Radiocarbon dating, however, suggests sometime more complicated. The sites are contemporaneous in terms of architectural style and Chichen may actually be a little bit earlier (Kowalski and Kristan-Graham 2007). So we don't know who influenced who. It could very well have been Chichen on Tula. Both scenarios, though, are unlikely. The Epiclassic was a period of upheaval and change. People latched onto whatever they could to secure power and part of that power stemmed from art and architecture. There are so many common elements in this period that we refer to this art style,as the International style.

 the widely popular conception that the Maya were driven from their cities by the Spanish Conquest is erroneous as the cities were already vacant by the time of the Spanish invasion (in fact, the Spanish conquerors had no idea the natives they found in the region were responsible for the enormous complexes of the cities). The Quiche Maya were defeated at the Battle of Utatlan in 1524 CE and this date traditionally marks the end of the Maya Civilization.

One sentence you say the cities were abandoned, but the next you say a battle took place at Q'umarkaj (Utatlan) which is a city. I'm afraid you are following the popular misconception that there were no Maya cities occupied when there were. It took many years of fighting for the Spanish to pacify the Maya region. The last Maya city to fall was Nojpeten and it did not fall until 1697 (Jones 1998).

 to reach the paradise of Tamoanchan (`place of the misty sky) where beautiful flowers bloomed.

Tomoanchan is Aztec and Postclassic, not Maya and Classic. You are blurring the lines between peoples and time periods. They are not one in the same, but distinct from one another.

 The great religious book of the Quiche Maya, the Popol-Vuh

That was written in 1701. You have to recognize that it is not a Classic period document, though it may have earlier roots. There are elements of the Popol Vuh that can be traced back further into Classic and even Preclassic artwork. But we cannot verify that the story stayed the same (unless someone finds a long Preclassic/Classic inscription or a book), we can only identify shared iconography.

 It has long been believed that the losing team (or the captain of the losing team) would be killed at the end of the match but recent advances in deciphering the Mayan glyphs, together with archaeological evidence, suggests it may have been the winning team or the winning captain who was given the honor of a quick death and instant passage to paradise.

There's no evidence for either outcome. Either way, you should provide specific sources on this statement

 This is not quite correct, however, as glyphs at many ball courts, Chichen Itza to name only one, ***could be interpreted***

Could be interpreted to be sensational and drive up clicks. Come on, mate. You just said researchers say there is no evidence for this.

 Only three books of the Maya escaped the conflagration at Mani: The Madrid Codex, The Dresden Codex, and The Paris Codex

And the Grolier Codex

 The Haab and the Tzolkin work together, like gears interlocking in a machine

That's just how Westerners visualize this. The Maya did not depict their calendars like that at all

 As the long count calendar begins 11 August 3114 BCE, it goes into its next cycle (known as a Baktun) on 21 December 2012 CE.

December 21, 2012 marked the beginning of the 13th b'ak'tun. That means the Long Count had undergone 12 previous cycles. December wasn't the first nor will it be the last.
    
 The claim that the Maya somehow vanished, simply because their cities were found abandoned, is not only inaccurate but insulting to the over six million Maya who carry on the traditions of their ancestors.

But that is exactly what you did when you glossed over the Postclassic and colonial periods.

<TEXT> Last week I had a problem where I would turn my computer on, but it would turn off after a second or so. Then it would turn back on and turn back off. To get it to stop, I had to flip the power supply switch in the back. I followed [this topic](http://superuser.com/questions/556288/my-computer-doesnt-start-it-is-stuck-in-a-turn-on-turn-off-loop) and everything worked out well. It seem that clearing the CMOS did the trick. 

I brougt Witcher 3 on Friday and played it on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday with no problems. I tried to play it yesterday, but my computer turned off twice. I figured it was the high winds outside messing with the power (since the lights sometimes dimmed). 

Today I've been using it all day with no problem surfing the web and doing some school work. After dinner I decided to play some more Witcher 3. I got about a half hour in and everything shut off. I turned it back on and the monitor showed black and flickered several times before turning off again. I can't blame this on the wind since there is no wind today. The monitor did this before, but turning the monitor off and then on would display the login screen. 

Edit: I have two monitors. The one I use the most has an HDMI cable, the other a VGA cable. It's just outputting to the VGA monitor instead of the HDMI one for whatever reason until the login starts up. Then it switches back.

I've opened up my computer to make sure nothing is loose from when I put everything back together and everything seems fine. 

So what's going on with my computer?

<TITLE> Pre-Columbian Murals and Norse Sagas Suggest zero contact between the Viking and Aztec, but Clyde Winters would have you think otherwise </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-28 02:12:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Our bad history in question,

http://www.ancient-origins.net/history/pre-columbian-murals-and-norse-sagas-suggest-vikings-met-aztecs-and-outcome-was-not-pretty-021084?nopaging=1

It starts off in the deep end and just wades around the bullshit. There's no testing the waters with a toe dip here before going head first in.

 Did the Vikings visit Pre-Columbian Mexico?

In short, no. But I have a feeling you are going to concoct a fantastical tale to explain to me why they did.

 The depiction of white people on Chichen Itza murals in the Temple of the Warriors probably represent Vikings

Or, and Im throwing this out there, you dont understand the conventions of Maya art and you are going to completely misinterpret things.

 There are also three traditions of the Norse Sagas that mention that in 965 or 986 Ari Marson set sail from Ireland in an attempt to reach Greenland. The story has it that Marsons ship ran into rough seas and a storm threw him off course. Within six days he had reached Mexico instead. The Eyrbggia saga and the voyage of Ari Marson may explain how the first white people got to the Yucatan.

Wheres the evidence Winters? While stories are great there needs to be some hard proof that the story is speaking the truth. And the story doesnt even describe Yucatan, the Maya, or anywhere else in Mesoamerica. HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY WENT TO YUCATAN?! There's a lot of doubt (nothing solidly Viking has been found) on the settlement at Point Rosee and that is in Newfoundland where L'Anse aux Meadows is. And you're trying to tell me these Vikings just completely missed the US Eastern seaboard, missed the Caribbean, and arrived in Yucatan in six days?

 Some researchers claim that the tribes joined the conquistadors in defeating the Aztecs because they represented a return of the white lords. However, most researchers say that this story about white lords was a myth created during the Spanish conquest. Restall wrote that: The legend of the returning lords, originated during the Spanish-Mexica war in Corts' reworking of Moctezuma's welcome speech, had by the 1550's merged with the Corts-as-Quetzalcoatl legend that the Franciscans had started spreading in the 1530s.

And yet you are going to ignore that? Really?

 Murals in the temple depict black, white, and brown people. In some of these murals one can see whites fighting and in bondage to blacks.

No, what you are seeing are people in body paint. If you took time to make note of it, you would see that the black warriors have different color faces. And that your white prisoners have many horizontal lines. Unless these black Maya were capturing mummies, one has to consider that these markings are meant to portray something other than skin color. In fact, if we look at the [mural as a whole]( http://www.celticnz.org/images/Nazca/Pre-Inca4.jpg) (sorry, cant find a large image that isnt [blurry]( https://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/202/flashcards/2906202/jpg/012f06c82308b10f4e916a97447dfd9c62b5360b44-142ED35F6BD76775F52.jpg)) instead of this one small part, we see white people on a building in war costumes like the black people.  You know why, Winters? Because the black figures were the ones doing the attacking. The white figures were the ones [defending](http://www.jstor.org/stable/275525?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). But you wouldn't understand that if you had just looked at one part of one mural and ignored everything else.

 In Esotericism of the Popol Vuh by Raphael Girard, one reads about the Dance of the Giants. This Mayan dance appears to represent a Pre-Columbian conflict between white and black people in Mexico.

 This book is quite illuminating. In it, Girard discusses the Dance of the Black Giants. The dance of the Black Giants explains the reason why the other indigenous peoples joined the Spanish in destroying the Aztec nation. Girard's description of the Dance of the Giants is startling.

If you actually take a look at the [chapter]( http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/popolvuh/pv-16.htm) it makes no mention that these giants have white or black skin. They are merely called the White Giant and the Black Giant. If Winters was aware of anything about Mesoamerica, he may know that white and black are both [colors associated with cardinal directions]( http://www.famsi.org/research/hopkins/DirectionalPartitions.pdf).  West was black, white was north, east is red, south is yellow, and blue/green is Center.

 The Chichen Itza mural indicates that the indigenous peoples had sided with the blacks when the whites first attempted to invade Mexico. However, it later appears that they felt the black giants were arrogant and boastful and they wanted to overthrow them  even though they originally had helped defeat the Vikings.

Or you read a book about Maya spirituality and because it ties into the Popol Vuh, a Kiche document of questionable age, you think it somehow ties in with the past. While it is all well and fine to conduct ethnographic work on people to help illuminate our understanding of the past, there is no bridge between these modern Kiche practices and pre-Columbian Maya beliefs. There are no murals or painted scenes which show these giants battling one another. And the mural at Chichen is inadequate because it depicts multiple black and white figures who are not fighting as well as villagers. 

 Although many of the Indigenous peoples sided with the blacks in their battle against the white invaders in Pre-Columbian times, by the time the Spanish arrived in Mexico the black rulers, namely the Aztecs, were mistreating the other groups of Indigenous peoples.

 The Spanish described the Aztecs as follows: The people of this land are well made, rather tall than short. They are swarthy as leopards, of good manners and gestures, for the greater part very skillful, robust, and tireless, and at the same time the most moderate men known. They are very warlike and face death with the greatest resolution.

Whoa, what? When did you establish that blacks were rulers of Mexico? Just on the basis of some Maya murals at Chichen? Chichen is not Mexico. Two different locations in Mesoamerica with two different cultures and two different heritages. On top of that leap that could cross the Grand Canyon, you provide a description which in no way describe the Aztecs as black.
 Archaeological evidence, Mayan and Spanish descriptions, and pictorial evidence from the codices indicate the Aztecs may have been black people. This would not be surprising because the Paleo-Americans Luzia and Naia were also black.

I dont know how to deconstruct such a bold faced lie without writing a whole book about it. What I can say is that within Aztec art they made a distinction of what black people looked like. Within the Codex there is a scene in which Cortes is meeting two Tlaxcalan lords [while being accompanied by a black servant]( http://christinaproenza.org/BlackConquistadors.pdf). Even in the colonial period when this was made, Aztec artists made it a point to highlight how different this servants skin was from their own.

 In summary, it would appear that the character named Gavite in the Dance of the Giants represents the Spanish. The blacks defeated by Gavite were the Aztecs, who were identified by the Maya and Spanish as black and were represented in the codices as a horrible people who mistreated the other local tribes.

 The whites who landed at Chichen Itza were Vikings. The Vikings were well-known navigators that sailed to many nations in Europe, including Great Britain. They may have been sailing in the Atlantic and were mislaid by a storm until they reached Mexico.

In summary? IN SUMMARY?! You didnt even prove that the white looking figures on the mural were Vikings. You chose an arbitrary date of the occupation of Chichen that coincided with Viking exploration of Greenland and Newfoundland and used that as your proof that somehow Vikings traveled all the way south to Yucatan. This is fucking horseshit and anyone with half a brain would recognize it as such. But I guess I should have expected this from a person who makes it their life [publish pseudo-history]( https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en q=clyde+winters btnG= as_sdt=1%2C23 as_sdtp=). I'm kind of surprised there was zero mention from our favorite Afrocentrist Ivan Van Sertima. Didn't think of using the worn and disproven ["Olmec were black"](http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/current/vansertima.pdf) card to try and bolster up your position? What a shame, it would have just added to the ridiculousness of this article.

<TEXT> I am reposting a question that went unanswered [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3r9bml/was_there_ethnic_strife_in_early_colonial_mexico/).

 I started reading The War for Mexico's West by Ida Altman. In the second chapter she states that Nuo de Guzmn recruited troops from central Mexico and Michoacan for his entrada into the territory that would become New Galicia (Jalisco, Zacatecas, Nayarit). Perhaps not in Guzmn's case, but in others, did internal fighting arise between these mixed regiments of formerly hostile groups? Did the Spanish keep these groups in separate camps? What prevented these groups from turning on one another in the heat of battle? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-10-27 05:04:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm finally getting around to reading Afanador-Pujol's book on the Relacion de Michoacan. She describes what the petamuti wears, but does not explain what they may mean. Accoutrements like a white garland on the head, a lip plug, bracelets, turquoise encrusted gourd, and a white, maroon, and black robe. The petamuti carries a lance-shaped staff with diagonal stripes in a candy cane pattern. Below the arrowhead on the staff hangs feathers and shells. Sometimes the petamuti wears a pendant in the shape of tweezers, red and black sandals, and red paint on the sideburn area of the face.

For those not familiar with the Relacion, here are some images pulled from the web,

<TEXT> I am having the hardest time finding a solution to my searching problem in Windows 8. I have on my computer a lot of journal articles in PDF form. The file names are the author and year and leave out the title of the article to reduce the file path length. In Windows 7 I was able to search my folder of journal articles for key terms and have relevant results returned to me first. When I try to do the same in 8, it gives me a list of results in alphabetical order and I can't find the article I had in mind. How do I change the search settings to give me relevant results and not results in alphabetical order? </TEXT>

* Grau, Lester W. "Breaking Contact Without Leaving Chaos: The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan." The Journal of Military Slavic Studies 20, no. 2 (2007): 235-261.

* There is a literature and a common perception that the Soviets were defeated and driven from Afghanistan. This is not true. When the Soviets left Afghanistan in 1989, they did so in a coordinated, deliberate, professional manner, leaving behind a functioning government, an improved military and an advisory and economic effort insuring the continued viability of the government. The withdrawal was based on a coordinated diplomatic, economic and military plan permitting Soviet forces to withdraw in good order and the Afghan government to survive. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA) managed to hold on despite the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Only then, with the loss of Soviet support and the increased efforts by the Mujahideen (holy warriors) and Pakistan, did the DRA slide toward defeat in April 1992. The Soviet effort to withdraw in good order was well executed and can serve as a model for other disengagements from similar nations. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan from 19791989, its occupation force, the 40th Army conducted 220 independent operations and over 400 combined operations of various scales. Many of these large-scale operations accomplished little, since this was primarily a tactical commanders' war. Some large-scale operations, such as the initial incursion into Afghanistan, Operation Magistral, which opened the highway to Khowst and the final withdrawal, were effective because the force employed was appropriate to the mission.

Some large-scale operations, such as the initial incursion into Afghanistan, Operation Magistral, which opened the highway to Khowst and the final withdrawal, were effective because the force employed was appropriate to the mission.

<TITLE> The AskHistorians Book Club - Call for Submissions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-17 17:51:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This topic is to ask for submissions for journal articles or book chapters from our community. ***Anyone can submit***, you do not need to have a flair. Please limit one submission per person. And please refrain from submitting entire books as our time frame does not allow it.

---

***Topic***

Any submission must be related to history. We have a wide variety of flaired users from fields such as archaeology to linguistics to medicine to music. Let's use it to our advantage. As long as the submission pertains to understanding the past, it is open for the book club. We are trying to broaden our horizons and understanding of the past and that must include seeing the past through a different lens. So do not frett if your submission comes from a medical journal, a music theory journal, or an edited volume by Mesoamerican archaeologists, it's all welcome. If it isn't, someone will kindly let you know. So if you want to submit something on Stonehenge, or changes in letter choice for recording indigenous languages during the colonial period, or advancements in medicine in the late 1700s, or experimental recreation of ancient music, go for it. 

***Article information***

Included in your submission must be the author or authors, the title of the work, the journal/book, year, etc. If using Google Scholar, there is an easy and handy Cite tool which gives a variety of options for citations. You can easily copy/paste that for your submission. My preference is MLA, but it will not be strictly enforced.

***Accessible***

Any journal article or book chapter must be accessible to the community, preferably through a link. The easiest way that Ive found to do this is to use Google Scholar. As Ive shown in [this example]( http://i.imgur.com/IeXcrPk.png), when searching for articles there is sometimes a link off to the right in which you can access the article or chapter for free. This is the link you must include in your submission, not a link to the journal page. I will be monitoring submissions to let anyone know if their links fail, but since I am based in the US my access could be biased. If anyone finds a broken link, please let me or the submitter know so that it can be fixed.

***Abstract/Summary***

Along with the link please include the abstract from the journal article or a written summary for the article/book chapter. This is to give us all an idea of what the article/chapter is about so that we can make a semi-informed vote.

***Voting***

Voting will run from now until Wednesday morning around 7am EST. Whichever submission has the most votes by that time will be chosen for us to read over the course of the following week.

Using the article from my Scholar example for our format example, the format should be as follows

 * Headrick, Annabeth. "The Street of the Dead It Really Was." Ancient Mesoamerica 10.01 (1999): 69-85.

 * https://media.smith.edu/media/ereserves/pdf_files/hillyer/f-j/headrick_street.pdf

 * The name Street of the Dead used to designate Teotihuacans main avenue originates from a Nahuatl notation on a sixteenth-century map. Though this story is often deemed apocryphal, I argue in this paper that oral tradition preserved conceptual information that may not be archaeologically recoverable. Support for this position comes from comparative cultural analysis of Mesoamerican mortuary bundles as they are expressed in ritual and iconography. Crucial to this argument are the well-known stone masks of Teotihuacan. A case is made that the masks originally served as the faces of oracular mortuary bundles. The likely existence of mortuary bundles at Teotihuacan generates organizational models for the city in which lineage emerges as a fundamental element and suggests new insight into status differentiation and the iconography of power at Teotihuacan. </TEXT>

* Charles Mann's "1491" article from The Atlantic, which eventually would lead to the book of the same name

* http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/03/1491/302445/

* "Before it became the New World, the Western Hemisphere was vastly more populous and sophisticated than has been thoughtan altogether more salubrious place to live at the time than, say, Europe. New evidence of both the extent of the population and its agricultural advancement leads to a remarkable conjecture: the Amazon rain forest may be largely a human artifact"

<TEXT> This topic is to ask for submissions for journal articles or book chapters from our community. ***Anyone can submit***, you do not need to have a flair. Please limit one submission per person. And please refrain from submitting entire books as our time frame does not allow it.

---

***Suggestions for this week***

Some users have made some suggestions regarding changes in format as we continue to develop the book club.

- Simpler format

Some have called for a simpler format when it comes to the title of the submission. The suggestion was just to have the title of the work and the author and leave out the journal or edited volume, year, page numbers, etc. Feedback on this would be appreciated and if anyone wants to try this out on their submission, please do.

- More general papers

The first paper was a rather niche subject, which I was fine with. But some people have expressed the desire for more general and accessible papers for now until we can build ourselves up to these more niche subjects. Perhaps for this round try and keep this in mind as you find something to submit. 

---

***Topic***

Any submission must be related to history. We have a wide variety of flaired users from fields such as archaeology to linguistics to medicine to music. Let's use it to our advantage. As long as the submission pertains to understanding the past, it is open for the book club. We are trying to broaden our horizons and understanding of the past and that must include seeing the past through a different lens. So do not frett if your submission comes from a medical journal, a music theory journal, or an edited volume by Mesoamerican archaeologists, it's all welcome. If it isn't, someone will kindly let you know. So if you want to submit something on Stonehenge, or changes in letter choice for recording indigenous languages during the colonial period, or advancements in medicine in the late 1700s, or experimental recreation of ancient music, go for it. 

***Article information***

Included in your submission must be the author or authors, the title of the work, the journal/book, year, etc. If using Google Scholar, there is an easy and handy Cite tool which gives a variety of options for citations. You can easily copy/paste that for your submission. My preference is MLA, but it will not be strictly enforced.

***Accessible***

Any journal article or book chapter must be accessible to the community, preferably through a link. The easiest way that Ive found to do this is to use Google Scholar. As Ive shown in [this example]( http://i.imgur.com/IeXcrPk.png), when searching for articles there is sometimes a link off to the right in which you can access the article or chapter for free. This is the link you must include in your submission, not a link to the journal page. I will be monitoring submissions to let anyone know if their links fail, but since I am based in the US my access could be biased. If anyone finds a broken link, please let me or the submitter know so that it can be fixed.

***Abstract/Summary***

Along with the link please include the abstract from the journal article or a written summary for the article/book chapter. This is to give us all an idea of what the article/chapter is about so that we can make a semi-informed vote.

***Voting***

Voting will run from now until Wednesday morning around 7am EST. Whichever submission has the most votes by that time will be chosen for us to read over the course of the following week.

Using the article from my Scholar example for our format example, the format should be as follows

 * Headrick, Annabeth. "The Street of the Dead It Really Was." Ancient Mesoamerica 10.01 (1999): 69-85.

 * https://media.smith.edu/media/ereserves/pdf_files/hillyer/f-j/headrick_street.pdf

 * The name Street of the Dead used to designate Teotihuacans main avenue originates from a Nahuatl notation on a sixteenth-century map. Though this story is often deemed apocryphal, I argue in this paper that oral tradition preserved conceptual information that may not be archaeologically recoverable. Support for this position comes from comparative cultural analysis of Mesoamerican mortuary bundles as they are expressed in ritual and iconography. Crucial to this argument are the well-known stone masks of Teotihuacan. A case is made that the masks originally served as the faces of oracular mortuary bundles. The likely existence of mortuary bundles at Teotihuacan generates organizational models for the city in which lineage emerges as a fundamental element and suggests new insight into status differentiation and the iconography of power at Teotihuacan.

* Brown, Elizabeth A.R., 'The Tyranny of a Construct: Feudalism and Historians of Medieval Europe', The American Historical Review, vol. 79, no. 4 (Oct. 1974), pp. 1063-88.

* http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1350026.files/Brown-Tyranny-of-a-Construct.pdf

* Peggy Brown's attack on the idea of feudalism is, as I said, a classic of medieval history, and remains important and controversial to this day. In this article, she tries to pull apart what historians mean by the world feudalism and how the concept has influenced how they interpret their sources. The end result is that she argues that feudalism is ultimately not a useful concept, that it confuses and obscures much more than it clarifies. Beyond the specific issue of feudalism, it raises lots of interesting issues about the uses of abstract concepts and models for the work of historians. Brown's work has been discussed before on AH, but I think this gives a unique chance for reader to engage with these kinds of big historiographical ideas and arguments first-hand.

<TITLE> The AskHistorians Book Club - Call for Submissions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-19 05:27:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [On Monday]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4nvm7y/bridging_the_gap_any_interest_in_starting_an/) I asked if there was any interest in an AskHistorians book club in which we all get together to read an academic journal article or book chapter from an edited volume and then discussed it. To my great surprise there was an overwhelming positive feedback to this idea. I hope the interest is still high as we take the next step forward by starting a trial run on our book club. As part of this trial we will be going with a two week format to start with (1st Sunday, submissions; 1st Wednesday, announcement; 2nd Wednesday, discussion; 2nd Sunday, submissions)

This topic is to ask for submissions for journal articles or book chapters from our community. ***Anyone can submit***, you do not need to have a flair. Please limit one submission per person. And please refrain from submitting entire books as our time frame does not allow it.

***Topic***

Any submission must be related to history. We have a wide variety of flaired users from fields such as archaeology to linguistics to medicine to music. Let's use it to our advantage. As long as the submission pertains to understanding the past, it is open for the book club. We are trying to broaden our horizons and understanding of the past and that must include seeing the past through a different lens. So do not frett if your submission comes from a medical journal, a music theory journal, or an edited volume by Mesoamerican archaeologists, it's all welcome. If it isn't, someone will kindly let you know. So if you want to submit something on Stonehenge, or changes in letter choice for recording indigenous languages during the colonial period, or advancements in medicine in the late 1700s, or experimental recreation of ancient music, go for it. 

***Article information***

Included in your submission must be the author or authors, the title of the work, the journal/book, year, etc. If using Google Scholar, there is an easy and handy Cite tool which gives a variety of options for citations. You can easily copy/paste that for your submission. My preference is MLA, but it will not be strictly enforced.

***Accessible***

Any journal article or book chapter must be accessible to the community, preferably through a link. The easiest way that Ive found to do this is to use Google Scholar. As Ive shown in [this example]( http://i.imgur.com/IeXcrPk.png), when searching for articles there is sometimes a link off to the right in which you can access the article or chapter for free. This is the link you must include in your submission, not a link to the journal page. I will be monitoring submissions to let anyone know if their links fail, but since I am based in the US my access could be biased. If anyone finds a broken link, please let me or the submitter know so that it can be fixed.

***Abstract/Summary***

Along with the link please include the abstract from the journal article or a written summary for the article/book chapter. This is to give us all an idea of what the article/chapter is about so that we can make a semi-informed vote.

***Voting***

Voting will run from now until Wednesday morning around 7am EST. Whichever submission has the most votes by that time will be chosen for us to read over the course of the following week.

---

Using the article from my Scholar example for our format example, the format should be as follows

 * Headrick, Annabeth. "The Street of the Dead It Really Was." Ancient Mesoamerica 10.01 (1999): 69-85.

 * https://media.smith.edu/media/ereserves/pdf_files/hillyer/f-j/headrick_street.pdf

 * The name Street of the Dead used to designate Teotihuacans main avenue originates from a Nahuatl notation on a sixteenth-century map. Though this story is often deemed apocryphal, I argue in this paper that oral tradition preserved conceptual information that may not be archaeologically recoverable. Support for this position comes from comparative cultural analysis of Mesoamerican mortuary bundles as they are expressed in ritual and iconography. Crucial to this argument are the well-known stone masks of Teotihuacan. A case is made that the masks originally served as the faces of oracular mortuary bundles. The likely existence of mortuary bundles at Teotihuacan generates organizational models for the city in which lineage emerges as a fundamental element and suggests new insight into status differentiation and the iconography of power at Teotihuacan.

Im not sure how mods want to handle comments, but lets treat this as we would any AskHistorians topic with comments focused on the topic and not making jokes or insulting anyone. Please be kind and be courteous. And lets take our first steps to a hopefully fruitful and informative new feature. </TEXT>

<TITLE> x-post - Bridging The Gap: Any interest in starting an AskHistorians "book club"? </TITLE>

As another large history subreddit, with many users posting here and on /r/AskHistorians, I would greatly appreciate any ideas and feedback on my book club idea I hope to implement.

The gist is that I want to get together a reading group on a monthly or bi-monthly basis to read journal articles or book chapters from edited volumes in order to broaden our understanding and knowledge base. Most of the source recommendations here and on AskHistorians are books, which do always cover or adequately cover topics of research that journal articles or book chapters do.

<TEXT> I've been tossing this idea around in my head for awhile and decided last week to pitch it to my fellow flaired users. But now that I've gotten their input, I want your input because this idea ultimately rests upon you.

I would like to start a sort of book club on AskHistorians, but not focus on books. Our recommendations of books are put into our [Books and Resources list](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books) which anyone is free to look at, peruse, and read at their discretion. Instead, I would like to turn our focus on journal articles or book chapters from edited volumes. These are the sorts of resources that academics rely on, but sources in which we don't put into our list above. Articles and book chapters are advantages because they focus on aspects of research and topics of discussion that may not always be included or discusses in a book by a single or group of authors. These works may be dry, they may be technical, and they may just have a lot of jargon, but I feel like our community would still be able to come together and read one of these pieces, and have an intelligent discussion. AskHistorians users were invited this past year to the American Historical Association conference because of our methods to bridge the gap between academia and the public. So let's take this one step further. Let's try and attempt to broaden our horizons and knowledge about topics we might not normally seek out and read ourselves. Let's do this together.

This book club would work on a month long rotation. The first week, a topic will be posted calling for submissions. Anyone can submit an article or book chapter, but there are requirements. Said submission must be available online and open to anyone. The easiest way to do that, I've found, is by searching Google Scholar. Often, but not always, there are links to academic institutions or places like researchgate.net in which these articles and book chapters are free to read. See [this example](http://i.imgur.com/IeXcrPk.png). When you make a submission, you must provide the title, authors, journal (if applicable) and date. Your basic citation format, essentially. But you must also provide the link to the work and either the abstract of the article or a summary (that you may have to write) of the work if it lacks an abstract. 

Submissions need not be limited to just articles/chapters from history journals or edited volumes. As AskHistorians embraces multiple fields in order to understand the past, so shall the book club. Feel free to submit things from anthropology (archaeology, linguistics, ethnography, bio anthropology), art history, medical journals, etc. As long as it pertains to history it is open to for reading. There is also no time depth requirement on submissions. You don't need to submit something that came out in the last few years. If you've found something from the 1800s and think people will be interested in reading it, perhaps for the information or perhaps to discuss how dated the ideas are, feel free to submit that, too. Over the course of a week, the submission topic will be open to voting. At the end of that week, the submission with the highest amount of votes will be the chosen work to be read.

Some of my fellow flaired users raised concerns that we might fall into a rotation of the same topics or time periods and never move on to lesser talked about topics. For now, I say let the market decide on what we read. If it does become a problem, we could always implement a system in which once an article/chapter that covers one of our flaired areas gets read, we no longer will take submissions from that area until the rest of the flaired areas are covered. But that is an option for a later time depending on our initial success. Thoughts and feedback are particularly welcome on this area, as is the rest of the proposal.

Once we have our article/chapter to read, we have two weeks to read it ourselves. At the end of those two weeks a topic will be made for people to focus their discussion. Try to include what you liked about the article/chapter, what you didn't like, what you didn't understand, what you want to know more about, what were the problems in the methodology or premise, etc. As I said, this is a way to broaden our knowledge and an attempt to fill in some of those gaps we may be interested in filling. Hopefully we have a few flaired users around who can help to answer questions and point towards sources of further reading for those that are interested.

The discussion topic will be open for a week and following that week will be a new submissions topic. Hopefully with many new, exciting, and different submissions than the previous week.

Hopefully with this month long rotation there is enough time for people to read and participate. I understand our daily lives get in the way sometimes and we can't always make time for things like this if we had a much shorter time frame.

Comments below have wondered if we could use a shorter format. I proposed this:

 We certainly could shorten it from a month to two weeks. For example,

 Sunday: submission topic

 Wednesday: announcement topic

 2nd Wednesday: discussion topic

 2nd Sunday: new submission topic

 This gives people a week, including the weekend, to read the article/chapter as well as the following weekend to think of and search for new articles/chapters to submit.


Please, provide your input on this idea because ultimately this is for you rather than just me or my fellow flaired users. I want a system that works for you, that gets you interested in reading more, and wanting to come back for more information or to ask us questions. </TEXT>
