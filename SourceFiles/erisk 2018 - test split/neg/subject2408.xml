<TEXT> They're shy kids who have trouble verbalizing their feelings to others. They get anxious easily. Koutarou is normally reserved but with people he's close with like his friends he can be pretty lively, whereas Akane is shy around her friends as well. I could write more but that's the basic of it. I don't understand your assumption that they have 'no personality,' seems like you're either not paying attention or you have some weird idea of what constitutes a personality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read it recently and watched the movie after that. What do you think of it? Do you think it's better with or without the final chapter?

For me, the most interesting aspect was probably the slang, if you guys know of any books that do something similar, feel free to recommend them to me. Also, I feel like this is probably controversial but personally I disagree with the view that a person should be given free will when they're clearly exercising that free will to ruin other people's lives. Though, I guess this leads to the slippery slope that everyone causes some level of harm to others, but the level of harm is far apart.

Also, I don't know if Burgess intended this or maybe I'm just misinterpreting something, but the last chapter made me think about something. The whole book is about Alex being controlled by others, but at the end, he's controlled by his own subconscious desires. He wants a baby because his subconscious mind desires it and he can't find pleasure in ultraviolence anymore. Isn't that a bit similar to what the government was doing to him with the Ludovico Technique, except, instead of pain and sickness, it's a more deeper unhappiness. We're controlled by our subconscious whether we like it or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Adding on to DocRocksO's list, from what I've seen of stuff by Kyoto Animation, they seem to employ show don't tell pretty well too. And  Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and the currently airing Tsuki ga Kirei has a lot that as well. Also, he mentions Miyazaki specifically but from what I've seen Studio Ghibli's stuff in general is better in regards to this than the vast majority of anime. There's also several anime which have badly written exposition as well as great visual storytelling such as Mob Psycho 100 and Evangelion and 3-Gatsu no Lion (which doesn't really have much blatant exposition but there's a few scenes where I felt dialogue was pointlessly reiterating stuff unnaturally).

I think it might be because a lot of anime are made as cheap, easy to consume entertainment and the main audience would rather watch something that spoonfeeds them information rather than having it naturally come out through the story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> About the tension aspect, I don't think there was supposed to be. It's supposed to be a conclusion to Shinji's character arc. It's also supposed to be isolated from the rest of the show, it's taking place during Instrumentality after all. 

About skipping out on what happened, I sort of agree, but I don't mind it either. The series was never about the actual fights, it was about the impact they had on the characters and with the culmination of that, we skip the fun bits entirely and focus on the characters. </TEXT>

Simon is in a reality with a much more cowardly Kamina and Yoko's is kinda random, though all the possibilities show her as satisfied in life. </TEXT>

There was one good answer talking about how there's tons of shows that don't have that kind of stuff and that the stereotype is more prevalent than the actual sexualisation in anime. The other answers were all, "I dislike it and that's why I don't watch anime. Miyazaki is one of the few exceptions that doesn't have this." There was even a reply claiming that Miyazaki movies were the sole exceptions to this rule. Not even all of Ghibli's movies, *just* Miyazaki. Ignorant people irritate me to no end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that only applies to plot points or character archetypes. With your argument, you could even claim that using camera angles to show a character's emotions or status is a cliche because it's been done to death. It's not a plot point, it's a representation of an emotion that the viewer can easily understand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Plot structure: Uncommon, since the only one people really relate it to is Robocop.

Of course since I haven't seen the movie myself, I can't comment on that but the common complaint I've heard is that it's structure is very similar to a generic hollywood blockbuster. Maybe something like how Marvel movies are all formulaic. I guess pacing could fit into this as well.

Pretty much just a repeat of plot structure.

Yeah, no. Script as in the dialogue, how characters communicate, what they say etc. </TEXT>

As for HxH, yeah, it looks so ugly, I've seen clips of it and it looks so computerized and shiny. I've seen stills of the older series that looks really good.

<TEXT> If you guys like this movie, you should check out Makoto Shinkai's other movies. 5 cm Per Second is my favorite adn it's also his most well-received movie (it's not as well known as Your Name though). 

Your Name has some similarities with his previous work, mostly thematically and visually but it is a bit different from other movies I've seen by him, it's more mainstream, I guess you could say. Not to say that's bad, but his other stuff tends to be more mood-focused than character or story focused. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't  really enjoy Eva the first time I watched it but I really loved the visuals and took a bunch of screenshots this time around that I was planning on posting here as an imgur album but didn't cause it breaks the illegal content rule (watermarks).

I really like the use of flat silhouettes in some of the shots. The backgrounds showing the city in the opening scenes are pretty neat,  the buildings are very lightly done (I can't come up with the words to describe it) they're pale grey looking and not very detailed which adds to the atmosphere in a way that I can't describe (again). This show's visuals are great though, both in their shot composition and framing and its use of colour. I really like the shot of Gendo and Shinji's first meeting, with Gendo in a tiny window of yellow light in the upper corner, far out of Shinji's reach and Unit 1's horn thing connecting him and Shinji. I was pretty dissapointed in the first Rebuild because it was a lot more generic (imo even kinda ugly) in terms of its visuals.

<TEXT> I don't remember much about how this arc began in the manga but I remember it being different, so anyone who does remember, how faithful is it?

I like the additional scene with Eren and Mikasa but something about the direction in this episode felt off. I read here that Tetsuro Araki didn't direct this season, and if that's true, then it makes sense. It doesn't capture the scale of the terror that well when the titans appear, especially during the Beast Titan's appearance and the music playing during Mike's battle didn't feel right, the fight itself was kinda underwhelming and didn't really show his skill properly.

The OP was pretty disappointing sound-wise, but it has some cool visuals (what's up with the animals though) and the ED has some nice foreshadowing and it sounds kind of creepy but I still like both the EDs from the first season way more.

Some weird directing techniques though, not a fan of the whole rewind thing they did and they did this weird rapid cut thing while Mike was getting eaten that was similar to Eren's dream at the beginning of the first season. Didn't really like that either.

The visual quality of the show seems to have increased, there's less drawing errors this time around than there were in the first season and the thick outlines are toned back a bit.

Disappointing in some aspects, great in others. The first season was better than the manga so let's hope this one continues that trend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What if it's anime original such as Flip Flappers, or if the pacing fits the show better as a 12 ep series? Not everything needs to be over 20+ eps, it can just feel bloated, just look at Attack on Titan, the second half is way too slow (mostly because the manga's pacing is bad but you get the point.) You need to pace your shows properly, some shows work better as 11-12 episode series, others do better as 20+ episodes. Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong, for example, are paced perfectly as 11 ep series. The amount of source material released isn't and shouldn't be the only aspect to look into when figuring out the pacing for a show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't seen Penny Dreadful but saying a show should only focus on a good actor if they cast a good actor is a dumb reason for saying a show is bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We got to see Levi be badass, that was a fun scene. He seems unaffected by the death of his soldier, but he's still willing to get covered in blood to comfort him in his last moments.
Also love the scene in the Titan's belly, it's the perfect amount of cheesy and Vogel im Kafig may be my favorite song in this series aside from the OP and EDs.

Armin and Mikasa are willing to put their lives in danger to protect Eren, even when everyone else thinks he's a monster (which he is). It really shows the bond between them better than any monologue would. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Adding on to otaku34's comment, he also has a movie coming up called [Yoru wa Mijikashi Arukeyo Otome](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34537/Yoru_wa_Mijikashi_Arukeyo_Otome?q=yoru%20wa%20mij) with a visual style really similar to Tatami Galaxy and the writer of the source material also wrote the novel that Tatami Galaxy is based on. In terms of art style, his other work isn't really similar to Tatami Galaxy as he likes to experiment with styles but they're all still worth checking out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you like moe comedies, then K-On, if you like drama, then Hibike Euphonium and if you like slow slice of lifes and detective fiction then Hyouka.

You can't really judge an entire studio's work based on one series by them, even if they rely on similar settings in most of them, they have different tones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Holden's suffered through some shitty things and he's generally lost and feels cut off from the rest of society, thinking that no one understands how he feels. I think a lot of people around his age can relate to his feelings (aside from the trauma). </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you want something that doesn't look at all like a typical anime and can be kinda fucked up at times, then Kaiba. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like most things about Hyouka but I especially love the silly visual metaphors.
I dislike Monster because of how melodramatic it can be and some of the dialogue, I remember thinking sounded pretentious. And I dislike Kuzu no Honkai because the character's decisions only exist to further the drama. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw Ghost in the Shell recently and it still holds up pretty well. It's not consistently amazing but it's pretty good. From what I've seen of Akira it looks pretty gorgeous as well. Also, I don't think Makoto Shinkai movies really have good animation though. The backgrounds are what they look the best at and the animation is kinda dull and at times mechanical looking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much anything by KyoAni (esp. Hibike, Hyouka, Nichijou and maybe K-On) and also, I think Mob Psycho 100 as well. Masaaki Yuasa works generally tend to have good animation as well, I think Kaiba and Tatami Galaxy have consistently good animation. Ping Pong's isn't bad either but it's not as consistent as the other two. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's definitely not a bad episode by any means, I don't think Hyouka has any (even 11.5, which alot of people seem to dislike) but I personally found it a bit underwhelming compared to the other episodes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I've seen of Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, it's pretty similar to Nichijou. Nichijou does have moe but it's also a really good absurdist comedy with great animation and direction (It is by KyoAni after all).
