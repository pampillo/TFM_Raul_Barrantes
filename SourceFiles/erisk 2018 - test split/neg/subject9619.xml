<TEXT>  she went from someone who didn't follow politics

That seemed to be my experience with people on r/politics. Especially after the election and with the formation of the new administration. They literally had/have no idea how the US government works. "A coup from the top" was my favorite article post.  
  
to someone that seems legitimately racist against white people.  
  
But with how scary all the media, not just news, makes Trump sound of course it brings out the crazy with people. Look at the ridiculous protests and reasoning you see, yet no one is willing to run for office, put money into candidates they agree with, or actually switch parties.  
  
Granted I've said this several times, but even my coworkers that complain are the same way, they get angry, post on some social media outlet and complain, zero participation in politics at any level. </TEXT>

One officer explained that 10 years ago if a suspect was stopped in a high-risk neighborhood, that person either ran or complied. Now, suspects are refusing to comply with lawful orders believing that law enforcement can't or won't do anything about it.  
  
http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/misc/2017/05/04/study.pdf  
  
I think most of those *lawful orders* were actually unlawful and thanks to the internet and videos that teach about cop interactions we've learned the BS cops act like is legal and now we know we can tell them to "fuck off." </TEXT>

He's never made any moves against assualt weapon as he called them. He's also pointed out city and rural differences. I could only find one source on the blaze confirming any thing about him banning assualt weapons, never semi auto. And in politics we know those are different.

<TEXT> If ISPs were allowed to go wherever they wanted this wouldn't be as much of a problem. Comcast used government regulation and anti-government owned/operated company regulation to stop the competition. The problem with only doing some things regarding a product in a libertarian way but not all or most aspects of it is you end up with lopsided outcomes.  But as a country we dabled with zero regulations and lots of people died and everything got polluted. A counter argument though is that people didn't care as much about that kind of stuff then. So it's hard to determine exactly what would happen since we now have much more readily accessible information about corporations and their practices. Yet people still buy Nestl.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most gun regulation is BS. Suppressors shouldn't cost $200 in a tax stamp and $800 to buy one. The price is artificially inflated and I think most people would prefer to hunt and shoot with suppressors if they were like $50-100 which is very likely if they're made unregulated.  
  
A fully automatic weapon is not going to cause mass deaths like the media acts. It just doesn't work that way when shooting them. Personally I'd love to have a 3 round burst capable gun that didn't cost $30,000. That's the thing, there are people that pay the giant fees and buy tanks and buy or make rounds. They have full auto 50 Cals on old jeeps they've bought. But the right to bear arms shouldn't be predicated by my paycheck being in the 2% territory.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> An impeachment process against Richard Nixon was formally initiated on February 6, 1974.  
  
the more you knooooooooooooow  
  
Yup, I know.  
  
On July 27, 29, and 30, 1974, the Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon, for obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress.  
  
Since he resigned before the process was completed, Trial and Vote, he was not "impeached" like you are trying to say. But for normal purposes, he was, he just resigned nulling the impeachment process.

<TEXT> There's quite a few sayings that do that in English. Some we've changed the meaning of. Some we haven't.  
  
I think the biggest difference is now everyone has access to dictionaries and ethnologies so the excuses for people misunderstanding words or phrases should be less. And why people think the rules are more firm than linguists like them to be.  
  
Spelling of words was arbitrary until we got our first dictionaries. Then suddenly we had rules based on what one man thought the spelling should be.

They go to college so they're already postponing marriage knowing that.  So automatically they're having kids and getting married later than the HS leads to a career generations. Then millennials realize they change. And they want to fuck other people. Even people that are older than me are getting married later and keep separate financial accounts.

<TEXT> In the United States, mandatory retirement policies are actually illegal for most professions, though thats only been true fairly recently. In the early 1970s, about half of all Americans were covered by mandatory-retirement provisions requiring they leave their jobs no later than a certain age, usually 65. In 1986, Congress abolished mandatory retirement by amending the Age Discrimination in Employment Act

A few fields, however, are exceptions. Certain occupations that are either too perilous  such as military service or federal law enforcement agencies  and others that demand high levels of physical and mental skill (like air traffic controllers and commercial pilots) generally still have mandatory retirement policies. Some large and mid-size accounting firms also require their partners to retire at a certain age. (My editor's CPA was forced out due to his age not long ago, despite being perfectly competent.) And many states require judges to retire at 70 , 72 or 75.

HAHA a funny, yet untrue and if you do it's lawsuit time, so either way a win.  
  
Someone was jailed for jaywalking in Sacramento a couple days ago. The charge was resisting arrest, although that was later dropped when people released footage of the officer dropping the suspect to the ground in the middle of the street before punching him.  
  
So not for jaywalking exactly, got it.  
  
I don't misunderstand mass incarceration. It's you who seem to want to jail those 'undesirable' to you. Did you go to the Spicer School of Communication?  
  
Read the article, I can tell you didn't because you would have said something else.

You clearly didn't read the article: "As employment in the service and retail sectors has grown, and dynamic staffing policies have spread, more workers depend on income from commissions, tips, and hourly work with fluctuating schedules." Your "insight" isn't very insightful.  
  
And the author is an NYU professor.
What did they think? Everybody got the same income and expenses every month?  
  
They tracked and reported, what do you want them to say? Also the frequency and volatility matched their income volatility which may have been surprising, rather than having smaller expense volatility.  
  
Also, there are lots of jobs where people do have the same income month after month and depending on where and how you live your expenses might not change. The percentages and wide swings are what's important. </TEXT>

Its fucking horrifying, the prosecutor said. Its totally horrifying and were all terrified about it, and we dont know what to do.  

The things they want us to do are so horrifyingthey want to do harboring cases of three or more people, the prosecutor continued. So if youre illegal and you bring your family over, then youre harboring your kid and your wife, and you can go to jail.  
  
I mean, harboring/encouraging illegal immigrants is a crime in the US. Don't know why it's so horrifying to prosecute it, I'd like to know which prosecutor said it so we can look at his record of what crimes he's prosecuted though. </TEXT>

Got her to agree to sex for as long as I wanted for $200. All my roommates and friends were laughing at her for agreeing to be a prostitute. She's a coke addict nowadays and we figured that's why she wanted the money. She gave me some BS story about car insurance. </TEXT>

Cheney is clearly the smartest and most evil of them. But he did his stuff to make himself and his friends more wealthy. He wasn't just bought and paid for like the other two.  
  
That's the biggest thing I think why we didn't mind having a dumb president like Bush. We knew he could run a state and we knew he would have at least smart guys on his staff with lots of government experience. And it was just after the fun peaceful 90s, more or less.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was just providing data on the 168. I didn't mention the 180 because it wasn't relevant. The 168 is faster than the 175, offers less recoil and is flatter in those shorter yards as well if I recall correctly. So with the shorter flight time and less recoil people perform better with it. In reality you should probably shoot both types.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I can find this is good ammo. Good find you should post it, or I will ;)  
  
Also this posted bullet is the Sierra Matchking bullet and the PPU cases apparently aren't the best and some people get a few FTC with them. Other than that I might buy some of these as my cheaper target/hunting and save my Federal.  
  
This ammo is also 175 gr vs the 168 PPU in your link.  </TEXT>

That link is for data. But 168 gr 308 ammo will stay supersonic at 1,000 yards out of almost any barrel. The longer the barrel the faster it'll be at 1,000 yards. Other bramds ammo might drop out of subsonic around 900 yards according to other people I've read online, but I have seen no data for this.  
  
Your biggest issue will be with down range wind, the 168 gr will move more in the wind. But 168 performs better sub 800 yards. Especially at the 300 and 600 ranges.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No state is 15 miles from me. Also double taxes to work in MD but live somewhere else. I have a rare corporate job where I don't actually have to go into a city. I live in a log cabin at the top of a farm where I can shoot anytime and hunt animals all over the woods since my landlord and neighbors are cool with it. The gun stuff sucks here and I'm trying to move back to Kansas. It'll suck commuting into Overland Park if I can get s job there, but at least I'll be able to make the 6 or so hour drive to my grandpa's land and hunt some pheasants.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I have my get rich idea. Pick your rounds and your pay scale.  
  
Cheapest monthly fee - You get whatever I have that's cheapest.  
   
Tier 2 - Cleaner ammo that's as cheap as I can get, so no Thunderbolt ammo here, but could be the same ammo as the cheapest if that's what I got for them!  
  
Tier 3 - Some sexier ammo, like a 6 or 7 but it's late at night so she's a 9.  
  
Tier 4 - This is some sweet ammo, basically the ammo people go, "This stuff is great, I'd buy 200 boxes if I had the money."  
  
Tier 5 - Why are you part of this club? Double ammo for you, sexy ammo and something a little less sexy but you'll like the way it moves.  
  
People pick the rounds they're looking for, we'll try to send out different ammo types each month if you have multiple selected.  Maybe a set for rifle and a set for handgun and then maybe even a "hard to get" set of price points for rare ammo in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's great! FBI dropped .40 cal and because the law offices across the land want to be cool they've been dumping theirs. (It's shit for tax payers but great for us) And you can get conversion barrels and/or slides for a lot of these guns and you get two calibers for a low cost.  
  
40 ammo has been a lot cheaper as well and basically there's now a growing civilian segment for it. Don't fear the 40 and you can shoot whatever's cheapest. I say this as someone that owns handguns in lots of calibers. Avoid 45LC you can't find it cheap anywhere :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never said "no", you did. You're arguing against yourself, or looking some sort of existential reasoning for not eating humans. I'm not here to provide that since I'm not here to convince you of eating one thing is less or more "wrong" than eating another. I just stated why people choose some things as valuable to kill and eat while others are not. You misunderstood why I am here. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Why kill them when I can keep them as slaves, though?

That's the essence of dairy versus feed cows and horses used for work versus horses eaten, it's your preference for their use.  
  
Not a difference that allows you to kill one but not the other.  
  
You mean between humans and animals, sure does. Unless you live somewhere with laws you're following that forbid the killing of people, then your preferences don't matter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jimmy Carter turned down secret service protection, he said it was a waste of taxpayers money. With all other presidents the secret service doesn't reveal how much is spent for security reasons. Currently ex presidents and their spouses (as long as they don't remarry after the ex president dies) get protection for life, their protection changes based on need. Their kids up until 16. Special circumstances allow the secret service to add or extend protection to the children for longer if needed. </TEXT>

I used the mag extenders. And I have a Taurus the exact same size. My MP buddy and a few others have shot it. Unlikely everyone is able to reproduce the same problem even when I don't tell them the issue and I say, "here shoot this gun" and they hit low and to the right.

<TEXT> I did. And they sent it back still shooting off and when I called the first time their gunsmith was very dismissive. That's why I don't recommend them. Their customer service is poor and they don't fix their products. They also don't tell you what they did in any detail. I can't let people invest in a product they seem to care so little about when so many other companies have helped me more with guns I've purchased used. Thanks bought the scccy new and I wish I could have just returned it after seeing how it shot. The no laquor rounds wasn't a deal breaker. But when it shoots low and to the right and I have multiple shooters try it out and I can shoot all my other pistols straight I lean toward the gun being fucked up. Other gun smiths have said it sounds like the barrel. I called and told them the issue. The lady on the line wasn't sure what to do. Transfered me to what she said was their head guy. He was dismissive about the issue. But said they had some upgrades for it and to send it in. So I did. Comes back with the same issue. I don't have time to waste with a shitty company, but I'll bash them all day online without hesitation to prevent anyone else from being fucked over.  </TEXT>

The plan sucks. My rates have gone up sense it's creation. All it really did was offset people having to get their own insurance, specifically kids out of school up to 26. Fuck them. Stop buying stupid shit and get healthcare.  
  
It's all about costs currently. And the only thing done about it was a symbolic gesture by Obama to stop federal private prisons. Democrats still don't give actual shit about it private prisons since we still have tons.

<TEXT> Don't be such a fallacy creator. But those politicians either wanted this to be an issue or were too dumb to know it would become one. Either way they are shitting on people that just want to use whatever bathroom they wanted.   
  
I can solve the marriage one. Stop calling it that. Marriage can be reserved for religion but just call all "marriages" civil unions as a legal term and then it's done. That's all they had to do.  
  
Republicans are for healthcare. Just not a federal one since the 90s. You do know that ACA is a shitty version of Nixoncare right?  
  
Plenty of Democrats were for private prisons. Only recently have a mass number of people given a shit. No one paid attention for decades even though quite a few documentaries have been made about it. I think the one by Michael Moore if I'm not mistaken was one that really made it a popular issue.  
  
You know that most republicans opose the white house hint at a doj crackdown of recreational marijuana right? Oh no? That's because you clearly don't actually follow any of these issues and instead seem like a regressive liberal. Worst than the tea party.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man you are strange. You do make up arguments in your mind. Blaming people in the past? It happened on their watch. No one else to blame there lol. I didn't even make that "assertion" as you like to say. Your ABC diagrams you've tried to make are a little off as well because of wording as well. If you're asking me to debate the position that modern people aren't to be blamed for their ancestors from over 150 years ago sure, they weren't alive then and could not affect the outcome one way or the other even through household debate or voting. If you're asking about moral superiority then you can argue that people against slavery at the time were superior to those that advocate slavery. So in effect modern Americans who are against slavery hold the hire moral ground of their ancestors and are therefore morally superior. Work on your writing. Laters! </TEXT>

The people saying an America can't have a moral high ground because of what their country did in the past is the same as blaming the countrymans ancestors actions on him. I don't see how you can't connect those at this point.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the downvote but your comment above seemed intelligent. My point is most people do not still consider the Germans Nazis.   
  
Side note I have met people from places like Denmark which refuse to buy anything German or spend money there and won't even stop for gas there, the lingering anger is there still.
  
But the Nazis were worse and way closer, but when Germans talk about human rights no one goes, "you killed so many people with so little activity against it that clearly you're all as guilty and will be for a millennia."  So to bash America for having slaves well before any of us was born, after having relatives fight and die in the civil war, or even back further when there were small battles like in Kansas and Missouri is ignorant of the fact we had free blacks for a long time as well. Not saying that makes it ok. But you can't blame modern people for the decisions that were made before even most of their great grandparents were born. How far back do we need to go for forgiveness?  
  
Like Japan, most of the world doesn't hold their WW2 and earlier evils as their main thing. Well the Chinese do.  </TEXT>

If they had any sense they wouldn't have disagreed that the president is on call and they wouldn't disagree he can handle any situation from air force one. They disagreed that weekend people working would decide to contact someone like the chief of staff and then the president. They have no fucking idea how the white house functions. Same people called hiring a new staff a coup when every president does it. They're ignorant of the real world and politics. You don't have to like Trump, lots of people hated Bush especially during the second term. Lots hated Obama. But not once do I recall hiring your staff being called a coup from the top. They think Trump can't tell a joke in a room. Everything he says is literal. Same mindset slammed Hillary for saying America is great because America is good. I heard it and went ah, Americans are good and that's what makes America great. I wasn't like oh what a retard!

First, this is a logical fallacy.  
  
Second, yea, you care about a few things that the parties think differently on. They both voted for war, they both drone strike people, they both approve and reup the patriot act, they were both approving of the TPP. If you take the time to look online people will put together handy info charts sometimes listing all the shit they agree with and find the narrow things they disagree on. They both aren't into cutting the budget in a meaningful way or for smaller governments either.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine just came yesterday, shoved the boxes in the ammo cans I bought with it and I'll never use it cause regular price was like $31 a box and I got it for $17.75 a box.  
  
Maybe if I get my long range gun I'll pull it out. I too am now waiting for .308 ammo to be less than $17.75 a box for decent stuff after that deal. Until then I only have some surplus 7.62 from the 70s and Austria to shoot. Definitely had two misfires so far with that surplus ammo lol. I just want some decent $15 a box .308 and $15 a box FN 5.7 and I'll be happy. Free or cheap shipping and I'd be ecstatic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think most are jerks when it comes to the fees. My LGS is cool and doesn't charge extra. But he was talking about buying it new and I know when I look at a lot of places websites it's more than $10 for the long gun fee. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  background check and transfer fee with paper work
  
Yes. This was a complete thought. There's paper work which includes background check and transfer fee. There's what, 3 papers you fill out for handguns and two for long guns? I get that the fees are different, usually 10-25 buck difference. But most places I see advertised say "long gun transfer fee: $30" or the like. In MD. So maybe the vernacular is wrong, but he's going to be charged. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've got a lot of loaded questions. The first one, yes I think that everyone interested in continuing a career in politics beyond 4 years with Trump has very much snubbed him. I mean fuck, the GOP in the house and senate still distance themselves from him. She also wasn't the biggest donor. And ever collectively from her family as far as I saw was not the biggest donor and they've been doing it since the 80s. Sanders asked about it, and I honestly think that her family had made a ton with political influence and I haven't heard from anyone else saying they were considered or turned it down. So until some more qualified people show up in a leaked email I'd bet Betsy contacted Donald and volunteered. And it's Trump so he was probably happy to have one less decision to make about the government.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll skip down to the appointments. Here we have a twofold problem. One, Trump dissed most politicians and alienated tons more. Two, Trump only knows a few people that would even work for the government.  
  
So with problem one he's got no one to pick from. And let's say he did, who do you normally get to run the DoE, someone that's run a large education department like in LA or NY or someone that ran a state one or has some experience doing so. He blew those out of the water. DeVos has private school experience. Mostly raising funds I believe but I think there were other charter things she did on state and city levels. Well if you're a fan of charter schools, scaring public schools to drop unions, or liked the documentary Waiting for Superman, then she might be the right person to be there.  
  
As for Pai he's doing exactly what Republicans want and while probably the most qualified person Trump could pick from was a shitty choice for those that advocate against Comcast and throttling.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so I decided to do some actual research since salon is a pretty crap news source.  They're just rewriting [this article from Reuters with a huge lean](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO).  
  
Personally I've never heard of the Department of Homeland Security's program Countering Violent Extremism. I am pretty positive most people commenting here haven't either. So let's take a look.  
  
From the Reuters' article:
The program, "Countering Violent Extremism," or CVE, would be changed to "Countering Islamic Extremism" or "Countering Radical Islamic Extremism," the sources said, and would no longer target groups such as white supremacists who have also carried out bombings and shootings in the United States.  
  
Oh shit, is there some other group that does this, sure the FBI and NSA and others do. So what does this program do then?  
  
Reuters:
...the CVE program, which focuses on U.S. residents and is separate from a military effort to fight extremism online, has been criticized even by some supporters as ineffective.  
  
In 2016, Congress appropriated $10 million in grants for CVE efforts and DHS awarded the first round of grants on Jan. 13, a week before Trump was inaugurated.  
  
Oh, so they do grants, I mean 10 million isn't a ton, but ok. Let's go to the [CVE website (yea they have one!)](https://www.dhs.gov/countering-violent-extremism)  
  
DHS/CVE website:
These new grants will provide state, local and tribal partners and community groupsreligious groups, mental health and social service providers, educators and other NGOswith the ability to build prevention programs that address the root causes of violent extremism and deter individuals who may already be radicalizing to violence.  
  
In the Reuters article they mention groups like Life After Hate for ex neo nazis as recipients of these funds.  
  
So here are the CVE's main lines of effort:  
  
**Community Engagement.** OCP works with the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to facilitate community engagements to build awareness and promote dialogue with community partners, which includes engagements with DHS senior leadership;  
  
**Field Support Expansion and Training.** OCP supports DHS field staff across the country to develop and strengthen local partnerships and to provide training opportunities;  
  
**Grant Support.** OCP is working closely with FEMA to issue a notice of funding opportunity for community-based programs this summer;  
  
**Philanthropic Engagement.** OCP works with the philanthropic community to maximize support for local communities, and encourage long-term partnerships;  
  
**Tech Sector Engagement.*** OCP engages the tech sector to identify and amplify credible voices online and promote counter-narratives against violent extremist messaging.  
  
[Here is a pdf from the CVE about their strategy.](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/16_1028_S1_CVE_strategy.pdf) </TEXT>

This election cycle the democrats instead tried to play in the crazy court with Republicans (really Tea Party people) and Trump et al out crazied them. The few facts that popped up were what swung the election for a lot of people. TPP, Hillary as a crony, shitting on Bernie by the DNC, Trump being lied about in the media constantly. Normal people say the 5 facts there were and went with them. Even at the top of this article, the Dems in Wichita calling everyone else "extremists". Normal people are like, "Whaa? Owning a gun in Kansas and taking it with you is extreme? But old farmer jones always has the 1911 and he's awesome!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems like you like the far side. But that article I can't agree with. It's just trying to make up some BS about family. If it was accurate it would have said your kids have grown up and now they need to make their own jokes you're right dad (Gary). But the nature of unimaginative people especially on Reddit is to copy something popular and reuse it until it's pounded into the ground or disappears on its own.  
  
I could get all my Far Side books and make a giant imgur album which could expose a lot of people to far side and how great it is. But it goes against the creators wishes and it shows through your articles take down notices that he still or at least cared then about them.  
  
Far side and Calvin   Hobbes can easily cover almost anything you'll reference like xkcd in a lot of ways. But I think most people respect those authors wishes and don't put out their material.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> So someone over on /. made a point, and I wanted to run it by here to see if people think Trump leaked info to Putin about FSB sources. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-26 16:22:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If you read the intelligence memo that accuses Trump of working with the FSB to win the election.
  
Ruslan Stoyanov fits SOURCE B, read the memo's:.
  
page 1: "Speaking to a trusted compatriot in June 2016, sources A and B, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure and former top level Russian Intelligence Officer".
  
Source B will be the Kaspersky man arrested, ex top level intelligence officer arrested shortly after Trump's inauguration, when Trump gets access to the names of spies that America has in Russia.
  
https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html
  
Page 2. "The Moscow Ritz Carlton episode involving TRUMP reported above was confirmed by Source E..."
Source E, is FSB man, known to CIA and MI6 and considered reliable, so he will be Sergei Mikhailov who was arrested.
  
Source F was a hotel staffer who confirmed it, Source D is an associate of Trump's, Source A, the Russian Foreign Office official.
  
If you remember Trump's comments to Richard Brandson: "Donald Trump told Richard Branson during their first encounter that he would spend the remainder of his life trying to destroy five people he had asked to no avail to aid him after his latest bankruptcy.". Trump is all about revenge and attack anyone who isn't 100% on Trump message.
  
Do you think Trump wouldn't immediately take steps to attack the spies who leaked details of his piss sex sessions to the CIA? Of course he would. He'll have obtained the names of these sources from the CIA (they are known reliable spies for the CIA), and he'll have passed those to Putin by his co-operation back-channel.
  
So it's no surprise to see an FSB agent and a former intelligence man arrested immediately after Trump takes office and gains access to intelligence names.

<TITLE> [Assistance requested] iPhone 6s plus, 10.2, no previous issues, phone turns off before battery dead, website says unaffected phone </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-10 23:09:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have an iphone 6s plus. It's on the latest commercial update (non-dev) and I have been experiencing the turn off at lower percentages issue I thought only plagued some phones. It started after the 10.2 update. It dies usually under 20% and after a fairly long wait I can power it back on and it will have a few percentage points less than when it went off.  
  
I really haven't found anything useful online since it isn't in any affected batches according to apple's website. Should I wait out until another update or contact apple care?  
  
I have the apple care plan from when I bought my phone in the summer time as well.  
  
Thanks for any help.  
  
Edit: So now I can turn it back on, and it will load, let me unlock it, then it dies again. Now it says 6% power. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm wondering if anyone (studies, reports, researched articles or videos) has gone into detail and examined this very much, also do politicians being involved have anything to do with the media (recent artciles about the way movie and tv production companies are coming to light from people like Elijah Wood) and the churches as well? Are they working together?  
  
This may have been addressed before, so links to that are fine as well. Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Link to product: http://www.fusionfirearms.com/parts/frame-parts/mainspring-housings/magwells/mag-well-msh-gov-plain-black  
  
I purchased this magwell, took my 1911 apart, put the spring and pin into the housing and the pin at the bottom of the grip wouldn't go in. The Fusion's main spring housing pin hole was machined a few millimeters off and I couldn't get the pin in.  
  
I asked about exchanging it, they said no problem and I mailed it back. Instead they refunded my money so now I'm probably going to buy a Smith and Alexander one from a recommendation on another post I made. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Complicated title, but fairly recently a well known exploration company found a sunken Spanish Gold ship. They put their claim in which was later turned over to the Spanish government (back room deal involving some art that I won't go into), but the country in South America where the gold originated from was barred from staking a claim. Why is that, and where do those exclusionary laws come from? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I remember a while back, months easily that this came out. I remember seeing it on imgur before I was on reddit more. The artwork wasn't exactly stolen, but some artist took another fox image and reproduced it very, very closely. Added the text and Taylor Swift posted it on twitter. It's like the ultimate form of dejavu if I'm wrong, because none of this seems new or original, but reddit is freaking out like this is a new event. Anyone else remember it? I'll go look for the original posts now.

<TITLE> [Advice] Hi all, my sister wants a Surface after success with Windows Phone, looking for some help </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-07 17:59:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I figured I'd come here for some advice on which surface for her to get. She did the online helper on MS's site and it said for her to get the Pro 3 or the Surface 4. I only know that the pro 3 is where they started being good machines, and I was wondering if you could provide some more insight.  
  
She's going to be going to grad school and that this will be her primary device, she currently uses an older Apple Macbook. Her degree is more Arts and Sciences than engineering, so I'm not worried about her needing compiling power and she won't be doing any film editing or rendering as far as I've been told.  
  
Thanks in advance for any help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi all, I'm looking to get some accessories and looking for recommendations and deals that you know of.  
  
A trigger seems to be the biggest thing I saw that got switched out on forums of this gun, any recommendations on trigger and why you like them?  
  
The sight is a V type that isn't adjustable (unless I have that vice like tool) and I have to aim the front site pretty high above the rear sight to hit what I'm shooting at, so I'm looking for an adjustable sight. Any advice there?  
  
Magazines, any to stay away from? Any good deals you've seen out there?  
  
I have a Serpa holster in coyote tan for it with the leg platform (my preference of placement for handguns and revolvers), so I'm good there.  
  
Anything else you all can think of that I should look into changing or upgrading? </TEXT>

I know a few people have had this happen, but I haven't found any fixes, a new band, a few restores and it still comes back immediately. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Everyone that types a negative comment will have a slightly lower credit score. If you like the comment your credit score drops too. If you follow someone on twitter they don't like, lower the score. You retweet how awesome your banks are it'll probably go up. http://www.computerworld.com/article/2990203/security/aclu-orwellian-citizen-score-chinas-credit-score-system-is-a-warning-for-americans.html  
  
With how much the government and by proxy the corporations that pay for those politicians want to be able to know who you are behind your IP this reality is more and more likely.  
  
The thing is most credit score evaluations metrics are trade secrets, so no one outside of the company can tell you exactly what's measured or what their weight is in the metrics. For example your job and your pay are included, but you never told anyone where you work or how much you get paid besides the government for tax time.  Oh wait, your employer might have, and one of the 3 credit reporting companies sold it and tracks it, and if a potential employer wants to know they can get your past pay info: http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/exclusive-your-employer-may-share-your-salary-equifax-might-sell-1B8173066  
  
It's scary how much information is out there that you might not even realize because you got a credit card, yet somehow a lot more than that is reported to credit bureaus. </TEXT>

<TITLE> HQL the process for me, a story for others </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-04 15:13:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So the tl;dr version is, I applied ave got my HQL.  
  
I finally decided to stop waiting for the law to be overturned and since I've been finger printed for my job I knew my prints were already on time somewhere. Personally I don't believe that they don't store them after s background check.  

I found a place to do finger printing without an appointment. This cost me $52.00, *son of a bitch*, right? The guy then circled the tracking number as the number you enter. This turned out to be incorrect. The number that begins with a "Y", which I confirmed with an employee at the MSDP.
  
I went looking for an HQL certification class. The day I signed up for a nonrefundable class I mentioned it to my coworker. He asked if I had taken a hunter safety class, which of course was a yes. He pointed out that I didn't need the handgun class then.  
  
He showed me online that it was buried in an exceptions area not on the main pages of the HQL section of the Maryland State Police Department website. I dug around the site using Google and found that it had to be within 3 years. Luckily for me I took it two years ago with a friend when it was offered for free at the local ruritan. She didn't want to go alone so I said I'd go with her.  
  
Quick short story, I wore my NRA hat the second day. She said she "couldn't believe I was wearing it and that it embarrassed her." Several people at the class complimented me or gave an NRA shout out to me and later at the local market a guy that was in the class came up to its and said he saw my hat earlier and wanted to say it was awesome. She couldn't believe the positive response.  
  
So I went home after work and got my hunter safety certificate and took a picture to upload it to the website. As I'm filling out the website the prerequisite section would not load up. I went looking online for an answer, turns out you need an older version than IE 11. Compatibility view wasn't working and I tried to install 10 on a friends laptop after installing 11, but it would always bomb out.  
  
Online someone on a forum and another person on reddit said they called in and a person did it over the phone. So I called up, no one was in the office until Monday. I called Monday and a lady said she would call me back after seeing if she could do it for me instead of me having to drive all the way down there.  
  
I called back later that day since the lady hadn't called me back by the designated time. As I'm talking to another lady I hear a woman say my name in the background, I mention to lady 2 that I think lady 1 is leaving me a voicemail. Lady 2 confirms this and transferred me to the original lady I called, lady 1.  
  
I had to give her my user name and password, I bit embarrassing since I used an unknown comic book character with an unfortunate name to give the police department lol. But she was able to see that first, I was using the wrong application, I need the qualification exempt application and second, that she was able to confirm all of my entered info was correct and formatted appropriately.  
  
Once completed I paid the $50, so that's $102 plus the $100 I've wasted on my nonrefundable class I didn't need. I completed the application on Monday. By Thursday/Friday it was complete and active. On Monday I had my HQL and Tuesday I went in and started the paperwork and 8 day wait to get two pistols.  
  
I was surprised how quickly my license came, but it's still a burdensome process to go through. I traded my class to a friend of mine for a tattoo or piece of art, don't know which will be cooler to have yet. Hopefully this story helps others. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-08-23 01:49:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As the title shows, I'm trying to apply for my handgun license in Maryland (such a pain in the ass) and the website is not working correctly.  On the prerequisite section it shows up with nothing in the area where there should be something to fill out.  Googling the issue has only shown that you need IE 11 and maybe to add it to the compatibility view list.  I did both of these and it still doesn't work.  No one is in the office until Monday to help me through the Maryland State Police, so anyone here that might have some advice would be awesome.  
  
I have tried Chrome, Safari, Safari on iPad, IE on WindowsPhone, Firefox and  none of them seem to work.  On the website they state they only take applications through the website.

Edit: thanks to u/Catriany I called up the MSPD and talked to a lady there, she had to log onto my account but she verified my other info was input correctly and finished the Prerequisite part! </TEXT>

So far I do plan on trying to get the groomsmen to bust out some fake medals like the end of episode IV.  But we'll see.  
  
Also I'm going to other subreddits looking for Harry Potter (which I don't know as much about) and LotR if you see a similar post from me else where.  
  
Thanks for all your help. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've contacted MS on twitter, phone, etc. They replaced my band hoping that was the issue since I hard reset it twice and uninstalled and reinstalled the MS Health app.  But unfortunately the bands keyboard still doesn't function like it used to (it's basically unusable).  Then with these latest updates the bands battery takes a real beating.  I don't know what's going on, but I hope there's some sort of fix soon.  (Side note: I was also worried that 3rd party apps were causing the issue so I didn't install them after another hard reset of the new band, [but no dice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h55HYoV0HH4).) </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I have a MS Band (love it, haters!) but my bluetooth keeps disconnecting.  I have recently reset the band and went through all the steps, it seems to be fine, but my phones bluetooth keeps disconnecting.  I recently power cycled it normally, not the hold volume down and power reset, it linked up after that, but for some reason it seems to disconnect but I can't figure out why.  It will reconnect by itself after I've waken the phone up and stay connected for a bit. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Serious] Why/When/How did the US Marshals get their power curbed? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-02 21:53:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The US Marshals were the sheriffs of the US, they could go into any territory, any state, any town and execute local and federal laws (no other federal agency can do this) so why are the relegated to mundane tasks of prisoner movement and catching escaped convicts (yes that is cool) but there is so much more they can do.  
  
Wouldn't the FBI/NSA/CIA/Homeland Security/Border Patrol all be way more effective if they were under the US Marshals purview? I've always wondered about the need for all of these other agencies when the initial declaration of the US Marshals makes them more than capable of doing all the tasks those agencies do.  
  
Thanks in advance for any history lesson provided. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so the only lyric I remember is something along the lines of "You are the left eye, I am the right." and in the video there's rioters and at one point cops on horses ride through the rioters and for no reason there's a part where an ambulance makes a sharp turn and rolls onto it's side.  All of this in the living room area. </TEXT>

Since the cost difference isn't very high I think the band would be a good way to go, does the Band do sleep monitoring too?  
  
Do any of you regret buying the band over a fitbit?  
  
Is there a new version on the horizon that should make me want to wait?  
  
Has anyone bought a used one before, any issues?  
  
Thanks in advance to any responses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the question explains itself.  I see constant posts and comments from people saying they need a new flagship (even though their oldest ones are still competetive (I think people just want newer things and I don't blame them)) or that their aren't enough apps.  
  
In my years with iPhones and short stint with Android the volume of apps are worthless. What really seems to be the issue is the few apps people want.  Snapchat, whatever other 3rd party supportless apps their are, and google apps, but most of these companies are waging a war from the 90s and early 2000s to hate M$.  If snapchat either allowed 3rd party apps or built one then half of the complaint posts would disappear and a lot of people on here would have convinced their friends to buy WPs.  
  
What I'm getting at is that most of the articles posted on here show that these companies or CEOs ust have something against MS the company.  It's really an image thing, and MS needs to correct that to correct it's other issues. </TEXT>

Who are these confused people?  I don't know, I don't think they exist outside of the folks that are actually confused and use "people" to describe themselves.  It's the "hey doc, my buddy says it pees when he burns" style of lying.  
  
Most people will look at the phones and see the different price points and base their decision on that.  When I worked retail that was my most common expierence.  If the prices were close and the packaging didn't really tell a difference in specs they would ask questions.  Usually it boiled down to quality differences like a plastic pop off back versus a nice removable back for instance.  
  
It just seems ridiculous that a lot of comments I see reflect this when overall the system makes sense.  I think the last few itteration of phones muddied the waters, but the XL thing and the X40 line of models will be more cohesive to be able to quickly look at the model numbers and get an idea of the quality and specs.  
  
I mention this mostly because of the 540 dual sim - the phone looks great in the pics, but that's my opinion.  I went to the MS store link from this sub, and even there most of the comments were positive, with a few complaining the specs looked like the 640 and now they don't understand.  Those people are clearly the one like on this sub that look more into the specs and try to find a value in a second, third, etc. phone.  Sure, some consumers do that, but from my years working selling phones and helping friends buy phones they either want the "best" phone regardless of price, the one they can afford, or the cheapest cause they just need a phone that works.  
  
Summary:  
I just feel like most of the commentors about the "it's so confusing" either haven't taken the time to look at current models and include too many past releases etc and get rightfully confised, or they themselves are just confused and want to see if others are too.  And sure lots of people get confused over this, but looking at recent phone releases and trends it looks like MS is making the numbering system make sense.  But we'll have to wait and see if I'm right. ;)  So chill out people, enjoy the ride. </TEXT>

So now my phone prompts me there is an update and I turned off automatically install.  But my question is when doing a hard reset can I restore from backup?  I have a backup before I tried so that'll work fine for me, but if I do another backup when I get home, and use that one, will that mess it up? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Who else goes caseless? Why or why not? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-07 20:20:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had a pretty nice case for my Lumia 1520.  I bought it and got it before I had my phone knowing about the screen bending in the pocket and popping out and I didn't like the camera resting on the table.  
  
(Funny that Apple didn't even look to the competition for issues with large phones)  
  
The case was nice, but I really like the phone without it and whenever I pulled it out of the case to show off people were impressed by the feel, the lightness, everything.  So now I just roll with my screen facing away from my body so it bends the other way and stays working.  
  
So do you go caseless or not?  And why?  
  
PS my 635 is caseless too ;) ooolala </TEXT>

<TITLE> SIM cloning question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-31 06:14:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have a few questions, this all stems from AT T not being able to register a phone as a data only device from my tablets SIM card.  
  
I want to copy my SIM, not to try to use at the same time, but for convience. I'd like to use my smaller phone either as a GPS/Internet device in my car or at work and my other tablet at home or if I go somewhere that I need it. For whatever reason AT T is unable to let me use the SIM from the Tablet in my secondary phone. They said I'd have to terminate the tablet contract (it was $0.99 plus 2 years at $10 for connection), pay the termination fee, then start a new connection plan or $15 a month plan for the secondary phone. Normally I've been able to and can switch my SIM card from phone to phone sometimes using a sim adapter because of SIM size issues and the phone works fine regardless of contract or not.  
  
So what I now want to do is create a copy of my phones sim to use in my secondary device. I know that only one can work at a time, etc. so that won't be a problem (the secondary phone is better to have while riding my motorcycle) it's just about not having to take the SIM out, risk breaking the SIM card tray or the card itself.  
  
If you stuck by this long we're at the questions:  
  
Are there any all in one cloning tools/kits that are less than $50 out there that will work with newer SIM cards? Mine has NFC ability so I know it's more encrypted.  
  
If not, is there any software compatible with MAC OSX that can handle the more heavily encrypted SIM? I haven't upgraded to Yosemite yet (I actually haven't used my computer in two years, between two tablets, a phablet, a phone and my work computers I don't really like using a computer at home).  
  
Since I'm not trying to just copy contacts and need a working SIM what SIM do you recommend?  
  
Should I get another AT T NFC enabled SIM to write over or is there a 3rd party I can get it from?  
  
Yes I know that AT T could detect the 2nd SIM, but if they cut my service I don't care, just means I won't pay any termination fees. Like I said, I'm just trying to avoid having to dismantle cases and covers everytime I want to switch devices.

I work for another large bank, and if we recieved a letter to the office of the president there was a special team assigned to look into it.  If several of you (10s of you) took the time to post an actual letter they might continue support for the app. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Still looking for My Commute help </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've uninstalled and reinstalled Here Drive+ deleted all commutes and set up my commute to work with a return time. If I'm lucky my commute updates for the return journey. Cortana has only mentioned my commute once. I've turned her options for reminding me to go to work etc from my calendar and she doesn't do that either. I have the address in the appointment daily for work. Any help would be much appreciated.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm going to give my sister an introductory windows phone, I figure a used one in good condition would be best. Then if she likes it I can help her get a nicer one. So far I've been looking at the 920s trying to stay below $100, closer to $50 would best. Thanks in advance for any advice.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> 1520 and gloves - What they heck? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-23 16:02:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So whenever I wear some thin gloves (I have them for driving and walking short distances in the cold) and I try to use my phone it recognizes the taps or scrolls, then when I stop it goes crazy selecting or tapping or swiping words.  This only happens outside or in my car while it's cold.  The second I take my thumb out of the glove and use it it's fine.

 nbsp;

I figure it has something to do with the cold, I just tested it at my desk and it seems fine.  But it doesn't make any sense because once I use a non-covered finger the weird clicks and scrolls stop. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help - Location based Cortana Reminders </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-20 17:11:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all, so I ask Cortana to remind me of things when I get home, but I live about 1/2 mile or so away from the main road where Cortana figures my address to be (it's also a little off).  I can't find a way to set my homes address/location based off chosing on a map or by "find location."  Am I missing something or is the only thing you can do is manually enter an address?

 nbsp;

Side note - I do not get a signal near my house, or up to a few miles away, so I have a microcell at my home.  This is really why I need to change the location reminder because Cortana (WP) doesn't seem to be able to associate my closeness and activate reminders. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Gestures Beta - Hey new people! </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm sure that this has been posted about before, but if you're new to Windows Phones try the app wpapp[Gestures Beta] (I don't know if the bot will pick this up so I put a link at the end).  It's super sweet, it picks up calls when you hold it to your ear, lay it down face up while on a call and it puts it on speaker, flip it over to it's face and it mutes the call but leaves it on speaker mode so you can listen.
