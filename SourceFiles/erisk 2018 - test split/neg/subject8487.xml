<TEXT> I work for a state agency and have a pension building, but need to be putting more towards retirement.  AND a home downpayment, AND a car savings- the list of things to save for seems endless at times and overwhelming.  My CC was at 13% interest so I wanted to throw everything at that...but now I'm looking at where to turn next.  My honda is just at 142,000 miles so it has a ton of life left in it, if I could be free and clear of a $218/ month car payment I thought I could really make headway in reallocating resources into things that work FOR me, not as liabilities.   That being said, I'm kind of a rookie to finances- looking for that advice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have, what to me seems like a quandary.  I am a housing inspector for a gov. agency and spend most of my day driving from zip code to zip code. My car is essentially my office. 
I own a 2008 Honda Accord sedan.  142,000. Lots of life in the car.  I recently spent an afternoon changing all the brakes, rotors and struts.  
Should go another 100,000 easy. I take care of it. 
I owe $3,900 and change on it and am nearing the end of a long battle with a credit card.  I owed $11,000 on it a few years ago and now it's down to $500.  I can smell victory. 

I'm debating a newish Honda Civic with many extra safety features.  A lot of the brake and lane assist type stuff that my car doesn't have.  

It would get better gas mileage.  I currently get $.48 cents a mile reimbursement to use my personal car for work.  

It seems appealing from a few standpoints, mostly additional safety features since I'm on the road so much.   

All that and then I'm back in the hole considerably with a car payment though.  Currently $220/month. More when I finish my CC bill.  

Is it worth it?  Do I drive my Honda clear into the ground and sell for basically nothing later on or get rid of it when there's still some value in it?  Is there a "sweet spot" for a time to sell a car and get a newer model? 
Am I thinking about this all wrong? 

Reddit geniuses unite!  :) thanks for any help in thinking about it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Re: forcing women to be pregnant- definitely not.  
I hear what you're saying but wonder if your analogy isn't quite spot on?   If I had no attachment to the person who needed a kidney or it was just a total stranger I would feel no obligation.  Both sexual partners, though, created this fetus so do they bare more personal responsibility for it?  

If I accidentally stabbed someone in the kidneys (not sure how that would happen) I would then most definitely feel like I owed them a kidney.  If there were no other donor and I was compatible I feel it would be morally obligatory to right a wrong I created.    </TEXT>

I think I'm more feeling on some level that a viable fetus should get to have a "go" at life.

<TITLE> This won't be popular but, can we talk about abortion? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-28 05:43:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been a soft-atheist for about 6 years now.  I won't get into the 'why's and how's', but I've prided myself on being pliable on issues and open to evidence. I always assume what I know isn't exhaustive on any particular issue and always take on each conversation with the intent on trying to learn something. 

That being said, and this could be a cross-over post to r/changemyview, in the past year or so, I've begun wondering about abortion and whether being staunchly pro-choice is the moral high ground.  Granted, there are innumerable one-off cases involving just about every scenario concerning mother's health, or baby's health, and on most of those cases I generally fall pro-choice, but when it comes to abortions of convenience (if that's a term even, I realize I have only a side perspective as a man) is it really right that we are terming "candidate members of society" as Hitchens called them?

I realize this may be an unpopular post, but it's just been on my mind lately.  My parents are still very Christian and very right wing, so when I ask them:
"I understand you're concerned about innocent lives being aborted but once the child is born into any number of non-viable family situations, who takes care of this kid?" they never have an answer. 

And, as classic right-wingers, they frown on tons of subsidies.

Still, the whole issue just doesn't seem to sit right with me.    Wondering if anyone out there in the Reddit ether can maybe help flesh out what I'm feeling and help me arrive at a safe port?  

I would say I'm still Pro-Choice, but it feels wrong somehow on a level I can't identify. 

ok, thanks for any input, and if I just ranted to myself, that probably helped too.  


EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback!  You've helped settle my mind quite a bit.  Apologies if I came off as arbiter of what "convenience"  meant.  It was too broad a brush-  I blame the strawberry lemonade I drank earlier.  Was hopped up on juice.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess I can see it both ways, I agree that a higher quality restaurant has additional value, I guess I don't like the idea that the price of the  food in particular is what constitutes how much I tip.  If I get great service at a chilis I feel the tip should be higher than at a steakhouse where the service isn't great. 
The service SHOULD be better but if it's not I don't like that the baseline for how much gratuity I owe jumps an energy level if the service isn't good.  

Maybe I'm not making sense.   I want to reiterate this isn't because I want to pay less in tips, I just don't feel like it should necessarily be based on food prices.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why is it that a server who brings me a hamburger, fries and a few soft drink refills on a tab of say, $12, get a tip for $2.40-3, but a server who brings me a filet mignon and a bottle of wine with a tab of $60 gets a tip of $12?  

Besides, perhaps, having to dress up nicer, the server themselves has exactly the same job description when it comes to what I'm receiving from them.   

Why don't we pay for something akin to an hourly wage? So, I think a servers time is worth a range of $12-15 dollars and hour and I pay that based on how long I'm at her station.    I had great service on a bill of $30, I was there for 45 minutes, I tip $11.25. 

Note, I'm not advocating a system where we tip less necessarily, but just that it not be based off WHAT they bring me, but how long I'm one of their tables.  

Maybe $12-15 is high because they would generally have multiple tables?  I'm not sure, I just feel the current system isn't fair to servers who do great jobs but work at a sandwich shop instead of a steakhouse.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Landlord has the router as his place, it's an airport extreme- all ethernet ports filled.  Is there a hub that doesn't require a hard-connection to the router?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Remote controlled fans </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-21 03:15:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have several fans (Lasko brand) that are remote controlled.  There is no hard on/off switch.  You plug it in, it's always off until you turn it on vs. the kind that you could turn a hard switch on, plug it in and it would start spinning.  

My question is: does anyone know of a work-around with Alexa and a smart-plug?

I'd like to be able to voice-control it.  

My guess is, I'll need to wait for fan tech to catch up.  

Thanks peeps.  </TEXT>

EDIT: Wow- thanks for the quick responses.  I'll give My Fitness Pal a try.  It's entirely possible that I knew half of this and have just been emotionally obfuscating it out of sheer lack of desire to start.  Funny how you can want to lose weight so badly, yet aren't really ready or willing to pony up the effort. This was motivating.   I appreciate you.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sorely needed a computer upgrade, and am wondering if I should just pay it off and deplete my savings to about $500, or pay it off $100 a month for the next 10 months?
It was a 0% interest deal for the first year. 

Nope, I don't have much in savings.  Shame face.  Working on it though!

Thanks for the input. </TEXT>

<TITLE> CMV:Need some quick help on this one- I selfishly don't want to invite in a newly homeless Vet to stay with me while he fights the VA to get access to his own benefit money. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-17 12:30:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As briefly as possible, I belong to a Meetup.com group for Former Fundamentalists and met this gentleman there.  I only attended once, but we've been FB friends ever since ( several months).  He's an ex-Marine who's been through 4 Tours and is disabled because of it- both physically and mentally (PTSD).  He's seen some amazing things and is good part metal and screws because of it.  He's been recently evicted from his place because of anger issues and the VA has somehow been able to restrict the flow of benefit money (I'm really foggy on this part, I don't know how it's even possible) that he receives because of it.   Sufficed to say the guy is homeless as of a few days ago until he can sort things out with the VA.  he actually has full military retired and paid benefits so apparently he fairly well for himself when he's actually getting his money.  To give you an idea, he's had to put his quite expensive car up for sale in order to get some money- hasn't sold it yet.  

Ok so here's my emotional dilemma: I have nothing but respect for the man.  He's seen and lived through things that would cause me to fetal up and cry like a baby.  I'm really torn because he has family about an hour away, he has other friends from the group who've known him longer and in person actually, and I live alone in a one bedroom apt. I suppose he could stay on my sofa? I selfishly don't want the hassle of having someone here indefinitely.  I don't want to have the eventual awkward conversation of, it's time for you to leave.  I'm a little terrified of his PTSD. I don't really know the man except for FB convos we've had and I took him out to dinner once when his posts started getting REALLY dark and hopeless.   

Boils down to, I'm wrestling with feeling guilty, and maybe I should, for not wanting to ask him to stay with me.  Deep down I feel it might be the right thing to do but it scares me and seems like it would be a hassle.  Whiiiich makes me fee like an asshole for even thinking.  

Help me out in thinking this through?

<TEXT> To be as succinct as possible, I'm a bigger guy.  6'2, heavily muscled but chubby.  Used to be in better shape but years and life sort of got the best of me and currently having issues shedding the weight I'd like. 
Online dating seems to net me, what I would consider, really nice women that I'm not that attracted to.  I used to beat myself up for meeting these really cool women who I got along with but stopped seeing because - you just can't fight attraction and the goal is romance. 

Point of all this being: I'm attracted to women who are average sized to thin and seem to get emailed and matched almost exclusively by women who are larger.   I always feel like a dick because I'M A LARGE DUDE myself- is that hypocritical? 

Women seem to be MORE about personality than men are, but let's be honest, women don't date just anyone either. 

I'm sure my confidence hasn't come away unscathed, but I'm fairly gregarious and occasionally witty, and I have a good beard lol.

Sooo, 
Do I just stop dating until I've managed to lose a little weight?  Do I keep dating in hopes I find myself a woman who likes bigger guys?

It's been a frustrating number of years. 

Also, please note I have ZERO against heavier women.  It's just doesn't rev my engine. 

I think I'm in need of some new perspective on the whole thing.

Thanks in advance.  </TEXT>

The bottom two are pressed tightly against the gum and as such are starting to see some periodontal disease because flossing is next to impossible.  I'm resigned to getting those out, but my upper two are in, with plenty of room. I floss around them easily and have no issues. Do I have all 4 out?  

Need some advice here- don't want unnecessary surgery on the upper two if I don't need to.

<TEXT> A woman has taken interest in me that is clearly out of my league.  Her life is kind of a mess  (4 kids, no car, no job) and she has a strong personality.  Clearly she knows she's a 10 and I'm sure has had men drooling all over her her entire life- which is evident when we go out.   I know this woman is not a good choice, but as the title suggests, my pre-programming has a hard time leaving her alone.   She's super confident and last night told me, if we hang out today you'll be getting some p***y.   Talk some sense into me Reddit! 

UPDATE: Stayed in. Caught up on Walking Dead and rubbed one out.  
I appreciate all the feedback.  In the back of my mind I aways suspected  I wouldnt, but I needed a bit of support to reinforce that.  Left to the wimbs of my own unsupported decision making it would definitely have been more 50/50.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When most of us are jobless due to the automating of the vast majority of industries, what will we all do with ourselves?  

Side note for this question: I'm making the assumption that, at some point, universal basic income will be a reality and we won't be dying in the streets.

A decent portion of the population, I would wager, have some to most of their identity's wrapped up in their careers-  the thought that we'll all just kick back and enjoy life seems overly optimistic.

Does anyone else see this as a slow descent into dystopia vs. utopia?  
If I'm seeing this completely wrong and there are other opinions, I would love to hear them because I feel that us, losing our abilities to work for a living, will be a paradigm shift that we might take a looonnng time in being able to cope with.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Has anyone noticed the contrast of opinions between futurologists and professionals in the fields as to what the future might yield?  
Two primary examples being, will we cure cancer and will we ever achieve immortality ?  I GENERALLY find a high proportion of optimism about the answer to such questions being "yes" when reading articles by someone such as Ray Kurzweil or by posts on this subreddit ( again, generally speaking) - but when I speak to my friends who are IN the medical field, such as Dr.'s and Nurses, the outlook is considerably more grim.  

Any idea why this is or who stands to be correct?

EDIT: Today (2/4) from CNN- this is a prime example of what I'm talking about.

<TEXT> At a Tennessee Football Game---not a joke
 
Christianity is now the target of persecution...
 
THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS! GOD BLESS EVERYONE WHO READS THIS AND PASSES IT ON.
 
I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT A HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL CAN SEE THE PROBLEM, BUT OUR SOCIETY CANNOT.


Tennessee Football
This is a statement that was read over the PA system at the football game at Roane County High School , Kingston , Tennessee, by school principal, Jody McLeod 

"It has always been the custom at Roane County High School football games, to say a prayer and play the National Anthem, to honor God and Country." 

Due to a recent ruling by the Supreme Court, I am told that saying a Prayer is a violation of Federal Case Law. As I understand the law at this time, I can use this public facility to approve of sexual perversion and call it "an alternate life style," and, if someone is offended, that's OK. 

I can use it to condone sexual promiscuity, by dispensing condoms and calling it, "safe sex." If someone is offended, that's OK. 

I can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an unborn baby as a "viable" means of birth control." If someone is offended, no problem... 

I can designate a school day as "Earth Day" and involve students in activities to worship religiously and praise the goddess, "Mother Earth", and call it "ecology.." 

I can use literature, videos and presentations in the classroom that depicts people with strong, traditional Christian convictions as "simple minded" and "ignorant" and call it "enlightenment.." 

However, if anyone uses this facility to honor GOD and to                                  ask HIM to bless this event with safety and good sportsmanship, then Federal Case Law is violated. 

This appears to be inconsistent at best, and at worst, diabolical.Apparently, we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone, except GOD and HIS Commandments. 

Nevertheless , as a school principal, I frequently ask staff and students to abide by rules with which they do not necessarily agree. For me to do otherwise would be inconsistent at best, and at worst, hypocritical. I suffer from that affliction enough unintentionally. I certainly do not need to add an intentional transgression. 

For this reason, I shall "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's," and refrain from praying at this time. 

" However, if you feel inspired to honor, praise and thank GOD and ask HIM, in the name of JESUS, to bless this event, please feel free to do so.. As far as I know, that's not against the law--yet." 

One by one, the people in the stands bowed their heads, held hands with one another and began to pray. 

They prayed in the stands. They prayed in the team huddles. They prayed at the concession stand and they prayed in the Announcer's Box! 

The only place they didn't pray was in the Supreme Court of the United States of America- the Seat of "Justice" in the "one nation, under GOD." 

Somehow, Kingston , Tennessee , remembered what so many have forgotten. We are given the Freedom OF Religion, not the Freedom FROM ReligionPraise GOD that HIS remnant remains!

<TEXT> You can't forget that's this isn't all theory and no practice...
If you're a bible believing Christian god DOESN'T value free will. 
That's essentially what the bible is about- gods DIRECT intervention because we're obviously inept creatures.  So once we've established that he does intervene in human history (according to the bible and exclusively FOR the believer) Christians  can't say he values free will. Just look at prayer...they're BEGGING him to intervene.  But lets be realistic- in the end it's over-complicated beyond measure to try and squeeze god into the governing rules of logic and reason.  It's a much healthier assumption to say - no god exists and were just mammals making choices.   </TEXT>

I can hear it now "it's a blessing from God more children weren't  killed.  We give thanks for that."
