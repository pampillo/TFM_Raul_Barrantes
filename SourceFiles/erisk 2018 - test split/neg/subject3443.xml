<TEXT> yes it is just my opinion. In any case we saw in 205 that Conor was very good checking leg kicks. Eddie could only throw like 2 or 3 leg kicks because he said Conor checked one and damaged him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. Eddie implemented the wrong game plan. He tried to box with Conor. I am not saying that with the right game plan Eddie would win, but he knows there's that left for him.

I think Aldo's loss was more embarrassing. He got KO cold in 13s. It was not a fluke when Conor was trying that exact movement in the training room. 

I think Aldo has nothing for Conor. I think in a rematch Eddie is more likely to beat Conor than Aldo. </TEXT>

Both Conor and Nate have iphones, and iphones sound kind of decent. Probably the journalist too. I wonder where the UFC fucks up everything. Plenty of people do phone interviews (see Ariel for example), and it sounds much better.

Also it seems the UFC have some sort of noise cancelling filter which kills the signal completely. </TEXT>

I love their channel, I think it is a lot of fun and I think they make a lot of cool videos.

Regarding their guitars, no idea, I never played one, and I don't really like how they look, but hey, each to their own. I am sure that for the price range they are quite good guitars. They are hated for the same thing I said before, the idea of someone even trying to do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The EU can't pretend otherwise. Of course they can eject us fully from the EU but we're still on the European continent and that isn't going to change.

It is the UK who thinks that the Britain is hundreds of miles away from mainland Europe, and it is the UK who wants to eject from the EU.

If the UK comes tomorrow and says "fuck brexit, we are in again", it'd be received with open arms from the EU.

So don't phrase this like the EU "ejecting out" the UK, when it is the other way around. </TEXT>

Thanks to the UK being out the Turkey question is also done now (the UK were the only ones lobbying for them).

With anti EU movements being shafted in mainland Europe and the UK out, I think it is time for real integration.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  enormous

I guess you mean enormously bad, because that would mean plenty of countries would opt for that, and that would mean the death of the EU.

In case you think "but that's great! we all separated with only positive agreements!"

That is impossible, because every EU country wants something different. Most EU countries wouldn't want a free trade agreement with Germany, for example, because it clearly goes in one direction. Spain would prefer an open market with chinese, american and european products instead of buying overpriced german and french products. On the other hand, Spain wants free movement because it is good for tourism, and it wants EU investment for its agriculture that they would sell in EU.

That's why the EU works, one for me, one for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only reason why they don't go down is FPTP. This system makes it almost impossible for parties outside the top2 to win seats, and seats is the only thing that matters. This influences the electorate into voting A or B. It is a cycle that reinforces itself.

By the same reason Labour is one of the strongest "old school social" parties of Europe. See what happened in France, in Greece, Italy, Spain, Austria or recently in the Netherlands. In all these countries the classic "social labour" is kind of smashed, and they were in power not long ago.

This is not because Labour is doing better than them, but just because how the FPTP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By the way, in this case, Whirlpool is an american company, and the only reason why they manufacture in France is in order to sell products in the EU avoiding tarifs and the like.

If there were closed borders, then there wouldnt be any point in keeping that plant open. whirlpool could just manufacture everything in USA and then sell it in the EU. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The reason why France exports so much to countries like Spain or Italy is because the borders are open, which means there are no tarifs. Which means you can manufacture something in Lyon, put it in a truck, and sell it 5 hours later in Barcelona.

This gives France a huge advantage when compared to other countries like USA, Canada, Russia, China, India or Japan. They need to go through customs, they need to pay tarifs.

If there were no open borders, then french products would need to compete head to head in Barcelona (as an example) with american or chinese products.  And there's no way France can compete against them (keeping high wages).

As an example, the car market, in Spain 3 of the top5 selling brands are french (the other 2 german). You need to go to the 9th position to see a non european brand (toyota) (ford is 6th, which is american, but they are manufactured in Spain).

If you think that the 8 most selling car brands in Spain are all european just because they are the best, then you are wrong. The EU is a market that protects itselfs. Renault gets all the possible help to sell its cars in Spain, while Toyota gets as many hurdles as possible, to the point that some non eu brands manufacture in EU in order to sell as EU (such as Nissan in the UK, or as said Ford in Spain), which is good for us as europeans because it brings jobs in.

To answer your question, with closed borders France can still export loads, but good luck competing with the chinese products then. </TEXT>

I am from some other city where it is also rare to see the police around, but I remember watching a TV documentary about the police in the centre of my city, and at some point there was a map with moving dots, and there were almost a police person in every corner.

I am sure there are a lot of them in civilian clothes around glasgow. Generally if you can see big guys with sunglasses, caps and a backpack, it can be a policeman. People like this too: https://www.indymedia.org.uk/images/2011/11/488317.jpg

<TEXT> I disagree when you say that those events were "tame". You need to put things on perspective. Now they are tame because we have some worse stuff in the UFC, but back then, the idea of 2 guys in a cage, no rules, fighting to simulated death, was pretty brutal.

I never watched those events live, and I was a kid back then. I used to love fighting shit like Bruce Lee, JCV, Rocky,... and I remember a friend of mines had a magazine were they talked about the first UFC events, and it looked brutal.

The first time I watched one of those fights was around the start of Youtube, something like 2008, someone put some of the fights there I think (or maybe it was google videos, I don't even remember). I know around 2008 the UFC was well developed and it already had big stars like GSP, but I really had no idea about it. But I remember watching videos about UFC1 and shit like that, and I thought they were brutal. The idea of 2 guys in a cage fighting to death was tense as fuck.

I don't know, everything is relate to its time. Yesterday I was watching a movie from the 30s which is supposed to be a masterpiece. After 20 minutes I stopped it because I was bored, so I checked why people thought the movie was so good, and basically a lot of the stuff that made that movie good are things that nowadays we take for granted. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any mid range budget Hotel recommendation? Or mid range budget area where to stay? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-21 12:44:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have used the search engine, and I also checked the "tips for tourists", but I couldn't really find much about hotels (apart from people asking for the cheapest ones).

I will go to NYC 10 days during October, and we are looking for a mid range hotel where to stay. Our budget is around 250-300 per night (I would say this is high in Europe, not like 5 stars high, but like high range hotel), I hope this would translate into something good and decent in NYC. Obviously if we could get something cheaper, like 200 a night, that would be amazing, but so far everything we can see is around that range.

The only thing I have seen is people recommending to stay as far as possible from Times Square as possible, which we will do.

Because we are going for 10 days, our idea was to stay the first 5 days very near Central Park (because we like that location a lot), and then the last 5 days move to somewhere not as "central" but which gives more bang for the buck.

It would be very useful if you could recommend hotels, or places where to check later on on Trip Advisor or stuff like that.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am 31, and I think that the 3DS is the perfect system for old working people, because we have very limited time, so it is perfect to play in smal bursts, in the train, things like that.

On the other hand it would be impossible for me to play a PS4 or a Xbone, I just don't have the time to sit down and play for 1 hour, and when I have it I do prefer something more relaxing because I am usually tired.

Where I work people is more or less my age, and I don't know a single person with a Ps4 or xbox, most people have a 3DS or play phone games. This is why as an old guy I don't see ps4 or xbox as "adult consoles", but more like consoles for teenagers or guys in their early 20s (more childish, because that's only when you have so much free time). I wish I could have the time to enjoy them though. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any recommendation for rodent control? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-14 16:10:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> These last 2 nights I think I have heard rats or mice in my flat or very near it. I live in a ground floor, and we have had problems with rats in the backgarden for a few years (since a supermarket opened in our street, before that we were fine). But I never heard anything inside or near my flat, even though a council rat trap is just outside my window.

I haven't seen them, so I might be wrong, but I think I heard them. Today inspecting the area where the noises come from (a tiny room with a washing machine), I saw a pipe that goes to the ground, and a decent opening in my ground and in the walls near it were rats could easily sneak in. This wall is connected to a communal room in the close were the council placed some time ago a rat trap.

I have been checking through amazon to see what I can buy, but I am a bit lost. The acoustic stuff seems nice, but most people say it doesnt work. I don't see myself setting traps or stuff like that. I do prefer some sort of rat killer that the rats can eat or preferably some sort of repeller, but all the views for repellers are sort of bad.

Any recommendation? I really don't know what to do, but the idea of going to sleep and hearing rats around stresses me a lot. I have contacted the council a few times but they don't do anything. Just once like 2 years ago they put some traps, but that is it.

This is in the West End / Byred rd by the way. One of the big problems of living in building with mostly students is that they don't seem to give a fuck about anything, so the backgarden has been a horrible mess for a while with food, pizzas boxes and shit like that. This is probably attracting the rats, and my flat is just the nearer one. </TEXT>

You have everything you need at the moment. If you opt for the amp, I suggest you get something better (like a Yamaha THR10), so you can play with it also when it is not connected to a computer.

I wonder, though, if you could use tube headphone amp with a guitar instead. That would be very interesting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you have a decent sound card already, you don't need a focusrite or a PC audio interface.

Most people (myself included) have shitty integrated sound cards, and when we try to use it to play the guitar with Amplitube or GuitarRig, the latency makes it impossible and that's why in that situation getting something like a Focusrite is very useful. If you already have a decent sound card, the latency will be probably OK. So basically I suggest you connect your guitar directly to the sound card, and see how it goes. </TEXT>

now, yes. but what about in 10 years?

I have a tele mexican from 05, and a american strat from 99. the american has standard pickups, the tele has lindy fralin. Back when I put the LF pickups, this was like 07, the telecaster sounded "better" IMO, and it was my main guitar. 12 years later, the american just feels and sounds much better.  I think american fenders are time proof, mexicans are not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> as someone with a mexican telecaster, and a american stratocaster, the difference in quality between both guitars are huge.

I also used to be in the "mexicans are the same as americans" because for 10 years my main guitar was a mexican telecaster, but the moment I got the american stratocaster (and it was second hand from 99, while my tele was from 05, and dont start with the "uff the good mexicans are from 07 to 12" or whatever mythical stuff people say), the differences were HUGE.

Not really about tone, but about "feeling". the american just feels like a better guitar, the weight is more balanced, the finish is better, the neck feels better, the electronics look better. I don't know, every component piece feels much better. The stratocaster is 6 years older, and I mostly played my telecaster in my bedroom, but it just feels to be in a better state. Like the knobs, the jack connector, everything just seems better.

So I don't think there's a big difference in "tone", but if you get a 10 years old mexican and a 10 years old american, the american will feel much much better.

There is a reason why the guitars are 600 dollars cheaper. </TEXT>

lol you never stop upgrading.

About your question, I think any moment is good to upgrade, but if you have been only playing for 2 months, maybe going with a $600 guitar is too much. You can get cheap decent guitars for like 150-200$, or maybe even a bit less if you go second hand. I would upgrade your guitar into something decent in that range, and then after 1 year or so, decide if upgrading to the $600 guitar. </TEXT>

DC knows that if he doesn't beat JJ before he retires, there will be an * in this career. Especially if JJ comes back, gets the belt, and continues undefeated. This won't be like "Conor vs Khabib" in terms of "is Conor the best 55 or not?" because DC and JJ already fought. </TEXT>

Before or after the fight 3 are fine, but while it happens, 2 is the perfect number. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Japanese culture has always been amazing when mixing contemporary (or urban) stuff with some sort of fantasy. The idea of a random bloke living with his parents, watching anime in his bedroom and suddenly being transformed into some sort of hero is very common. Persona 5 is nothing new. FF8 especially was pure urban, to the point that you start in some sort of college. Or even before Chrono Trigger was set-up in some sort of urban place. These 2 games were huge and instant hits.

Japenese artists are very good doing this because it is was the readers want to see. They want to imagine themselves in that scenario. They want to think they can train boxing and become Hajime no Ippo, or get the Death Note, or go to Gantz, or time travel like in Erased, or be a super chef like in Food wars, or just make 100 push up a day and be One Punch Man.

In western culture it is rare, but not that strange. Harry Potter, for example, follows the same idea. Or even Spiderman. But the reality is that in western culture medieval fantasy stuff or sci fi are way more popular.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  bandwagon.

I guess you don't watch many Real Madrid games. Don't let the final score fool you.

let's ignore the game against Leganes because their stars were not playing. Against Alaves they won 3-0, but they played a horrible game. They scored in the 30min mark without really deserving it, then they were dominated by Alaves for like 50 minutes, and Alaves almost scored 2 goals. Madrid was playing horribly bad, to the point that their fans were booing. Then at the very end they just scored 2 goals very fast.

Real Madrid really plays to nothing. It is impossible to define their style. Without their big stars they would drop a lot of points.

And by the way, before anyway saying I am a blind FCB fan, I think the same about Luis Enrique. We play to nothing. Suarez and Messi just saved so many games of nothing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  fragmentation argument has always been overblown by people who participate in OS Wars

Especially because it also occurs in Windows, for example, when I am using W7 and I cannot update to 10 (some sort of enterprise license thing, I don't really care). Or now with Vulcan, DirectX (and its many versions), OpenGL,...

It also occurs with browsers, which is the piece of software most used nowadays: Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE,...

Fragmentation is good. The idea of "converge" is bollocks. The reason why Linux market share is under 1% is not because "people is confused between gnome, KDE and the several distros". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a computer with an integrated sound card and a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2.

Yesterday I was doing some basic testing, connecting my speakers to either the desktop output or the Focusrite headphones output. In both cases using a mini jack, which was going directly to my desktop, or through a converter to the focusrite.

I was getting stereo sound in the focusrite, but the sound quality from my desktop was much higher. The focusrite sounded flat, almost no bass, very crappy, while the desktop output sounded OK.

We find that, contrary to concerns voiced by opponents of the law, AB60 has had no discernible short-term effect on the number of accidents. The law primarily allowed existing unlicensed drivers to legalize their driving. We also find that, although AB60 had no effect on the rate of fatal accidents, it did decrease the rate of hit and run accidents, suggesting that the policy reduced fears of deportation and vehicle impoundment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gibraltar will remain part of the UK, I am sure 100%. An agreement between the UK and Spain is more complicated. The UK basically wants Spain to bend over. In a agreement both sides must win something.

<TEXT> Every member will be able to veto the agreement between the UK and the EU. It needs to be approved by all of them.

Some of the things that you say, such as energy, renewables, housing and labour, are unrelated to the EU now that the UK has left it. What's the point on having an agreement about those points with the EU if you are leaving it? It defeats the point of Brexit. The UK will only care about getting trade, and as long as you comply with the EU trading rules, everything else is fine.

The only important thing for Gibraltar in regards to the EU is the border and freedom of movement. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  ...implying that Gibraltar is not sovereign.

Gibraltar land, water and air borders are surrounded by Spain.

When the UK was part of the EU, the EU forced Spain to open the border, and so they did. Now Gibraltar is not part of the EU (or it won't in 2 years). The EU cannot say how the Gibraltar - Spain border will be. This is something that only Spain, the UK and Gibraltar can decide.

Imagine that the UK remained in the EU, but that Ireland left, and the EU contacts the UK "We have decided that your border with Ireland will be open, so open it now". Do you think that the UK will take that? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The final term in the EU's negotiating position is basically Spain asserting a limited form of sovereignty over Gibraltar.

False. The only thing said is that Spain will be allowed to veto any agreement the EU might do with Gibraltar. Meaning the UK and Gibraltar will need to deal directly with Spain.

The only thing said so far is that the UK won't be able to circumvent Spain when negotiating Gibraltar with the EU. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are over hyping our (spanish) diplomats. The only thing they care about is expensive food, alcohol, whores, and envelopes with money.

This all started with the comment from Tusk, saying that Spain will be able to veto any agreement with Gibraltar, which is just a way of saying that the UK must reach an agreement directly with Spain. Whatever agreement the UK reaches with the EU, it probably won't work with Gibraltar, unless the UK wants to close Gibraltar to the rest of the EU and sink millions every year just to keep it alive. The EU cannot force any other EU member to open its borders with a non EU country. It is as simple as that. When the UK was part of the EU, the EU forced Spain to open the order, and we did it.

This WAS NEVER ABOUT "as part of Brexit, Spain will take control of Gibraltar". British politicians need to be more pragmatic, more serious, more "realpolitik". Every stupid discrepancy cannot make headlines in the newspaper 2 days in a row, with almost war declarations. The UK always said "no agreement is better than a bad agreement", but the EU cannot also walk away from the agreement whenever they want.

That said, I hope Gibraltar remains part of the UK (because that is what Gibraltar wants), and I hope the UK and Spain reach an agreement regarding the border. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spain won't get "arsy".

People here are ignoring the original comment from Dusk, and just going into war scenarios.

The fact is that, whatever deal the UK does with the EU it won't involve freedom of movement, and as you said, freedom of movement is needed between Gibraltar and Spain, and that's why Tusk said that Spain will be able to veto it. This freedom of movement is very likely to be limited to Spain, not to the whole EU, because otherwise Gibraltar would be a buffer area for the UK in the EU. Same way, Spanish freedom of movement will be limited to Gibraltar, and not the whole UK.

You cannot force a EU country to have freedom of movement with a non-eu country just because "I want it". Spain and the UK will need to reach an agreement about this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spanish here, Spain won't veto, why:

* I know it might surprise to some here, but Spain has bigger problems than Scotland joining the EU.

* In terms of our nationalist movements (I am catalan myself), the fact that the UK gave Scotland Indyref1 is way worse than Scotland joining the EU, because the UK legitimised independent movements.

* As every government in Europe except the UK, our government is fragmentated. Our government won't be able to veto it directly, it would go through our parliment, and get the approval of 3-4 parties. It is not going to happen. it is just unnecesary wear and tear for something very unrelated to us.

* Spain will do whatever EU tells us to do. We will fake grunt and hope to get something in exchange.

* Finally, the idea of blocking Scotland from the EU "just because" doesnt make any democratic sense. </TEXT>

This is a false generalisation. I never felt pressure to be powerful and succesful. That's really a thing in a western society.

The reality is that noone expected anything from me. I was never athletic, had good looks, or have good grades. A school counselor when I was 14 (she was meeting with everyone), advised me to just have a technical job (such as being a plumber) as my career option.

<TEXT> I was thinking the same until I arrived to the section where he speaks about his last game.

First you watch the trailer, which is amazing. Really good stuff. You know that in order to do a game like that he is good coding, designing,... way above the average. Many of us have dreamed about doing games, and this guy just did an amazing indie one. Then he writes:

"Despite all I had learned up to this point, this game featured some of my biggest blunders."

This is an extreme "humblebrag". Especially because he says "some of my biggest blunders". "I just did this amazing indie game which many reviewers loved, but hey guys, it contains some of my biggest blunders humblebrag".

Then I re-read the article, and I realised everything is pure humblebrag. When he described his first game, when he was just 12... that game is brutal for someone who is 12. When I was 12 I had no idea how to code, and this guy was already doing games! he was probably a better coder than many people nowadays, but hey "his code was patently atrocious".

Then when he was 15 he did a freaking game engine, only being 15!, but hey, his code contained "monstrosities".

TLDR I am sure this guy is super proud of the things he did and the code he wrote. I know that if when I was 15 I coded a engine using directx I would be super proud, but hey, it is better to humblebrag, get some click, and say it was "atrocious" "I should delete it from my hard disk". </TEXT>

Steam and AAA, not really. Game library for Linux is minimal. If you want to play games you need windows. Yeah you can play Valve games and some other stuff, but the number of AAA games is really really small. Linux is not really taking off as a gaming platform. Valve is pushing for it, but it is not really working.

About the hardware, it really depends on what you have. if your hardware is well established and like 1 year old at least, then no problems. If you have an AMD card you may need to sweat blood to get it working. Some peripherical stuff might be a total nightmare, like a printer or a scanner. if you have an Intel i5 4440 with integrated card, then it will be perfect out of the box, same for nvidia.

And by the way, Linux has been my main OS for the last 15 years. But even today when installing new stuff in new computers (especially in laptops, it might be impossible) it can get very tricky. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a extreme case of "humblebrag".

All the games look very good considering when he did the first one he was like 12 or 13, and the last game shown is really really good. As an indie game it looks amazing, and I could see a lot of people paying for it.

The code is also "decent". He is learning new technologies and using new styles. By no means I would say it is "bad code" or "horror code". I could read through it and understand it.

Just by watching the last video you know he is an excellent programmer and game designer but it is better to say "what an horror I did", bait for some clicks, and humblebrag. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just wondering. I mostly listen music at work, and I mostly use youtube to do so. The other day I was considering buying new headphones, at the moment I am using cheap sennheiser hd202, but then I thought, is it worth it if I am going to mostly use Youtube?

Google says that: "The audio you hear during a YouTube video will usually be 126 kbps AAC in an MP4 container or anywhere from 50-165 kbps Opus in a WebM container. Changing video resolution (360p, 720p, etc) in the video settings will probably not impact the audio stream, but it is likely that your connection performance will. "

Which is kind of low, considering that before it seems they used 192. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually think ALBW hits a perfect spot in terms of difficulty. Oldest Zeldas have a lot of moment where you have no idea about what to do, and there are literally no hints.

I remember when I was a kid playing a link to the past, and then Ocarina. Without help from friends and Nintendo helpline, it would have been impossible for me to finish those games. Its like in a link to the past, when you need to run against the books with your pegasus boots, that's something that people will rarely think about, and there are no hints at all. Majoras Mask was brutal. I dont know anyone who was able to finish it back in the day. I finished it during christmas this time, and I had to use a guide constantly. The game is very poorly designed. Some of the old games were very annoying.

ALBW has a lot of "eureka" moments. For example, to access the first 2 dungeons, you need to do some work to do obtain the required object. It is not difficult, but some exploration is required.

Also, I think that Zelda games, are games where every one you play, the next one becomes easier. Like you know that if a dungeon is surrounded by water you need zora swimmers, and you know to check every watterfall for hidden passages, and you know that if a wall has 2 objects near each other leaving a gap, you better place a bomb there.

The season games had a lot of moments where the action required to moved forward made no sense. Like go to this exact spot and play an instrument. </TEXT>

False. After 2 years batteries go to 50% of capacity, hardly lasting a day, and software updates makes the phone almost unusable.

My smartphone of 5 years ago had a 3.5" screen which made it almost impossible to use as video player. It could barely play youtube videos, and it would fail completely with Netflix, Twitch or other streaming services as UFC. It was almost impossible to use it to browse the net.

Same was said about OoT, which IMO is still better than BotW.

In any case, the author of these videos loves "openness", choice, backtracking; and he often complains when dungeons are linear. So he was bound to love this game.

There have been excellent Zelda games which have been sort of "on rails", such as Wind Waker, which was also an excellent game.

If they do a game similar to MM, I really hope it won't have any sort of time travelling / limit time. </TEXT>

Non EU people which have made Scotland their home are very likely to be british citizens (unless they want to spend their live with the uncertainty of visas), in which case they could vote.

EU people rarely have british citizenship because it is not required for us. After Brexit, it will be very different, and you will find plenty of EU british citizens.

And if they should get a vote, for how long will this 'Scottish referendum voting rights' rule be grandfathered in as a special right if you're from the EU-27 forever more, should indyref 3 happen in 2030?

Indyref1 franchise was very clear:

Not only EU could vote, but also commonwealth people, meaning someone from Canada or Cameroon, who was resident in Scotland, could also vote.

<TITLE> Any tutorial for using SVM (or any other similar method) and OpenCV? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-20 12:32:28 </DATE>

<TEXT> I have been using opencv for a lot of years already, but most of the thing I have done is just image processing and some 3D reconstruction.

When I need to "find stuff", I use img proc to clean my image as much as I can, and then some algorithm to find the shapes I want to find (faces, corners, lines, color, background / foreground).

I want now to take a step forward and use SVM (or any similar method) to help the classification. Obviously I will do some sort of initial image processing, but then I want an algorithm to help me.

I just wonder if anyone can point me to any good tutorial about how to do this.

Thanks ! </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, I expect to be in Scotland for a long time (I hope, unless I am deported or something very bad happens), and my girlfriend of 4 years is from Scotland (born and bread, as you would say), so if we have children they are very likely to be born here, and I want to have an input on the future I am leaving to them. As the Tories seem keen to frame it, it seems I won't have any input at all, about my future, or the future of my children.

Secondly, what does exactly a vote represents? As I said before, people seems to think it is some kind of "part ownership". This thought is actually very modern and populistic (like your sentence "what nationality me and my chilndren will be", which is extremelly populistic. Using "childen" in any debate is a cheap shot, it is like saying "we should ban porn, think about the children). The romans were way more practical about what a vote means (more than 2000 years ago). You voted with your "tribe", and you represented your tribe. Even if I leave Scotland in X years, there will be another person, some other EU migrant, in a very similar condition to mines. The point of the franchise of Indyref1 was not about "who I am" but "who do I represent".

There are almost 200k EU citizens in Scotland, and you cannot just silence them, because their "tribe" is very likely to be in Scotland in 20 years, or 50 years, 100 years or 200 years. I am not voting "for me". I am voting for what a EU citizen in Scotland would vote.

Scottish people living elsewhere were not able to vote. Would you rather let them vote, even though a lot of them don't plan to set foot in Scotland again, instead of letting to vote people who is already living and established here? Does a "scottish expat" living in some beach in the mediterranean who will never visit Scotland again be able to say what nationality your kids will have? Because that's what the Tories want, by the way.

The tories let EU citizens to vote during Indyref1 because they knew most of us would vote no (EU uncertainy and all that), and now they want to remove us from the equation because they know most of us will vote yes. That's like the opposite of what democracy should be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I could vote during Indyref1. If they don't let me vote I will be very annoyed and feel that democracy failed here. Scotland has always been an example on how to define a voting franchise, I could also vote during the last  elections to the Scottish parliment, while as far as I know the only ones EU granted are the local ones.

I already think it is very stupid that I can vote in my original country, but not here. Is this stupid idea people have about their vote being like their "part of the ownership" of a country. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Being let loose in the calm courtyard with very little in the way of forced tutorials was such a great way to start the game. 

The problem is that new players don't really want that. Even if open worlds such as GTA, they want some direct marking telling them were to go.

I have a 3DS and I frequent a lot the 3DS subreddit here in Reddit, and there you can see how frequently new players complain about Ocarina of Time or Majora's mask, because they don't know what to do. The idea of "go out and explore" is kind of gone for the new generations. They want the game set in rails, and instant gratification. the idea of just roaming around without increasing the % of complete game is not something they like. </TEXT>

I am playing now Zelda: Link between worlds, and it follows the same scheme. There's no tutorial, and you need to move and explore around for a bit, where they show you a bit of the world, until you get new items to explore new areas.

I cannot remember any Nintendo game with a set tutorial. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think Mario64 aged poorly.

There's something that happens with videogames, and that also happens with other forms of art, like movies, fashion or music.

When the piece is initially released, everyone is shocked because it looks or sounds amazing. There's a period then when other pieces of art "improve" it, and the game (or song or movie) sounds or looks dated, and people says the "it aged poorly". But when there's a final step when the piece becomes an atemporal piece of art, and you enjoy it based on what it is.

Music is a very common example of this. If you listen to Led Zeppelin 1, the sound is incredible amazing, and if you compare it with nowadays production, a lot of people will say that they prefer vintage all analog production. There was a period, though, when everyone started to use digital for everything, that people said it sound aged.

My opinion of Mario64 is very similar to this. When I play it nowadays I think it is a unique piece of art. Yes, you can get games in your phone with better graphics (but not better art design). It is not only how it looks, but how responsive the game is, how the enemies move, the design of the levels, the classic music.

No one is playing it nowadays expecting something ground breaking, but even then it surprises you.

This is the same for every game with was really well made. I replayed FF8 recently and I got the same feeling. After the first 5 minutes of "this looks really blocky" you start to appreciate it. </TEXT>

First of all to consider the library of the DS part of the 3DS is not fair. If we do that, then the PSP is the best handheld ever (it could play all PSX games) (no idea about if the Vita still can).

Just by comparing the 3DS to the other Nintendo handheld systems, it has a weak library. I would the 3DS library is similar to the GBA, but weaker than the GB or the DS. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  the 3D gameplay

Link between worlds is not really retro style. The world I would say is fully 3D and very well drawn. The only thing is that the game view is top bottom. Just because it is the newest game I would say it is the one with the best art and best design of characters.

It really never felt like a 2D game to me, and very often the camera moves around and things like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Any of them, they are really disconnected games, and they are not story driven. I mean, the overall story is very basic, usually the sub-plots are more interesting.

I would suggest you start with A link between worlds, only because it is the newest one, and the mechanics and everything are very refined, and I am sure you will like it.

Ocarina is the best one for me, best game ever, but its mechanics are almost 20 years old, so for some people it is a bit of hit or miss. Same with Majora's mask. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2 years? More like 5 or 10. During the next 2 years after article 50, only the terms of the break up will be discussed. In this case it is very simple, UK citizens won't have access to EU health. There won't be any "building agreement" during this 2 years, but only how shared resources will be split , such as debt, or EU facilities in the UK and things like that.

After the UK is cleanly out (so 2 years later), then they will need to go around Europe knocking on doors trying to get an agreement with different countries. I expect this to take 5-10 years. 

In the case of the EU health card.. it is not really a big problem. Travel insurances are cheap.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hillary Clinton never had a 80%. 2 months before their GE she had like a 45%, and Trump had like a 40%. It was a big gap. And by the way, she won the popular vote on those terms, more or less.

I dont know if you know how the french system works, but there are 2 rounds. First one free for all, second one for the 2 most voted ones.

At the moment Le Pen is leading the polls with a 26.3%, she is, as you know, similar to UKIP. The second one is Macron, which is leading a brand new party, with a 25.3%, this party is very similar to LibDems. Then you have Fillon (sort of Tories), with a 19.2%, then Hamon (Labour) with a 13.9%, and finally you have Melenchon (far left) with a 11.6%.

it is very very likely that Le Pen and Macron will go to the second round. Both parties are "fresh brand new". Le Pen's is not that new, but it is the first time they are in this position.

There's no way that their Labour or far left will vote for Le Pen. So in the second round Macron can expect something like a minimum of a 50.8%, and this is ignoring the fact that a lot of Tories will vote for him (the same way a lot of Tories voters in the UK would vote for LibDems instead of UKIP). Polls actually give him around a 70%, while LePen will have a 30%.

In any case, even if Le Pen wins the second round, with an initial 25% she won't be able to form a government.

BTW, betting agencies give first round to Le Pen with a 4/6, but second round to Macron with a 8/11 (second round for Le Pen is a 5/2).

There will be a lot of hysteria once Le Pen wins the first round, saying she won the elections, while that is false. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  We all knew that negotiating with a group of 27 countries, each with their own wants, is going to take a lot of time.

This is something I think the UK never understood about EU. Your political system behaves like an absolut power that changes every 5 years (basically this is caused by the way you give seats). Politicians rarely negotiate. They win elections, and then they decide what to do.

On the other hand, in most EU countries, government is shared by 2-5 parties. There are even governments with no party control (like Belgium for 2 years, Spain for 1 year), and countries in minority without any alliance (like Spain now). This means that EU politicians are very used to long negotiations, trades, and giving up a lot of their key points just to reach an agreement. EU politicians are very used to give up things. UK politicians are not.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What the UK doesn't seem to understand is that:

(a) The UK is leaving EU, not the other way around. EU is already busy managing nearly 500m people. Why should the EU take the first step? It doesn't make any sense. The EU is not making TM wait. The EU is already busy with some other stuff.

(b) when Article 50 is invoked, what will be negotiated are the terms of the break-up. Nothing more, nothing less. The UK thinks they will "negotiate" with the EU and talk about trades and things like that. That's not going to happen. Only the break-up terms will be negotiated, which will be basically about debt, eu people in the uk, british people in the eu, shared resources that will need to be reallocated, and money floating in projects that might extend more than 2019. From the moment article 50 is invoked, to the 2 years deadline, the talk will be only about "how we break this".

(c) only after 2 years and when the UK is fully out, then, and only then, the UK will be able to negotiate with the countries about trades and all that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because this second referendum is directly related to the UK leaving the EU while Scotland voted for the EU, it makes perfect sense for EU citizens to vote now in indyref2, even more than indyref1.

I am a EU citizen living in Scotland. I have been here for a few years and i want to stay here even more years. The UK wants to deport me while Scotland wants freedom of movement. Why I wouldn't be able to vote? 

In any case, EU citizens in Scotland are a minority, around 200k people out of 5.5m , whatever we vote won't really change anything. </TEXT>

Basically there are around 200k EU citizens in Scotland, who during Indyref1 voted NO for obvious reasons, and now they will vote YES for obvious reasons.

<TEXT> I voted yes during indyref1, and I will vote yes again, but this is a mistake from SNP. It is too early.

They like to think that because of Brexit a lot of people would have changed its mind, but it is not true. In my workplace most people votes No, and not a single one has changed their mind.

It is like Brexit in this subreddit. We think that because the pound dropped a 10% and EU doesnt offer a good trade, a los of leavers would vote remain if asked tomorrow, but the reality is that every poll out there indicates a very similar results to Brexit1.

if the SNP wants to win it, they need to make a long term plan for 10 or 15 years.

The main difference here are going to be the EU people, who voted en masse for a NO and now will vote for a YES. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I voted yes, and I will vote yes again, but I think this one is coming too early, basically because I think it will be lost again. Similar to what happened in Canada. There there were 15 years between referendums, which I think it is much better.

People's opinion doesn't change that fast. It is a common mistake we do when we lose something, we think that we are still right, them wrong. It is like brexit. If you go to r/uk with the pound dropping, no trade with EU,... it seems that people would vote en masse now for a remain, but every poll out there seems to say that the results would be very similar.

SNP thinks that they were "right" and the others "wrong", and that because of Brexit and May a lot of "no" voters would swap to "yes". Where I work there are a lot of no voters, and not a single one has changed their opinion, not a single one. They give you exactly the same reasons.

I think the SNP should have waited at least 10 years between referendums, "educate" the people and teach them the "yes". This is what they have been doing in Catalunya for more than 30 years. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I don't know whether Enrique is a good or shit manager.

IMO Lucho doesn't add anything, but he doesnt remove anything (like Tata, I think he had a negative factor). He is neither positive nor negative. So basically, the players are the ones doing everything. I think the same about Zidane by the way. They just keep the players fit and a bit motivated. Tactically none of them are genious, and they read the games very slow. Sometimes this is the kind of coach you need. Del Bosque was like that, and he won everything.

Pep on the other hand was a genius, and even Rijkaard was a net positive factor, except the last 2 seasons when he lost control of the team, but during the first 3 seasons you could see Rijkaard was very important. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am spanish myself, and this is my fifth year in Glasgow. I have tried plenty of spanish restaurants here, and none of them really convinced me. I am not expecting a 3 michelin star place, especially not for tapas. But I don't know, everything was kind of disappointing. Nothing really taste "home made", and everything tasted like from frozen or almost ready.

What I suggest is that you cook the paella yourself. It is really easy to cook. The total cooking time takes like 1 hour, but the steps are really easy.

If you want chicken paella, it would be something like this:

- Get some sort of big pan. If you don't have one, a pot will do it. A pot will result in a more watery rice, in spain we call this "arroz caldoso" instead of paella. But it is equally nice.

- Put olive oil. I recommend to put A LOT, without going overboard. a thin layer covering the whole pan. If using a pot, because the surface is smaller, a bit more.

- Once the oil is hot, throw in pieces of garlic. I would say 1 per person, until the garlic is a bit golden.

- Then add your chicken. Whatever you feel like you are going to eat. With or without bones, it doesnt matter. Just put it however you like it.

- Get 1 tomato per person, and grate its inside. You dont want any skin, just the inside. So just split in half the tomato, and grate through the soft part. Once it is all grated. throw in with the chicken. Shake and move everything, probably lower the fire. Once the chicken is golden, and the tomato is kind of gone, it is usually the right time.

- Adding your veg. Standard paella uses bajoqueta y garrafon, this is some sort of big white beans and green beans. You won't find this here. so use whatever you feel like eating. long green beans work very well (chopped into pieces), as do artichoke hearts, peppers or garden peas. Shake everything together, and let it cook.

- Once you feel it is cooked, it is the same to add the rice. You need to know your rice (how much water per rice portion), and this is something you will master as you repeat the recipe. In Spain we use "bomba rice", which you can buy in supermarkets here, but it is uber expensive. Unless you are rich, I recommend just long rice. In my experience, a mug of milk is something like 3-4 portions of rice, but use any measurement you are used to. If I put a mug of rice, then I usually put 1 mug of water. But as I said, this really depends on the rice, so initially I would suggest going for like 1:1.5

- Just after the rice and water, add the spices. Big supermarkets sell a "paella mix" sachet (or tube) which works quite well. Try to get that. Otherwise it is really a mixture of saffron and paprika. But I recommend just buying one that is done.

- Now add half stock cube (chicken).

- Because you likely added cold water, put the hob up, until the water bubbles, then keep a medium point for the hob knob.

- something very important, dont move the rice! people tends to move everything while cooking, but if you shake the things around, the rice breaks and becomes like a paste. Just make sure carefully that the rice is equally distributed, and let it cook, dont ever touch it again!

- wait until all the water from the surface is gone. Then carefull move some of the rice around, to see if there's any water underneath. If you cannot find any water, then it is done! otherwise let it cooked it for a bit more.

- remove the pan from the hob, and let it sit for 10. then eat it! Something common is to add lemon afterwards.

The most important thing about paella is to remember that everything is cooked in the same pot, in different stages. but always in the same pot. first meat, then veg, then rice, layer by layer. I have seen people or places cooking the rice in a separate pot and then putting all together, no!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Their reach is identical, which is the most important factor IMO, and this is very good for Jose if he is going to fight someone who is primarly a striker. Mendes hit him mostly when he was feinging a TD.

Apart from that, Jose has won against taller fighters (Korean Zombie, Kenny Florian). I don't think it is going to be a problem for Jose, because he has never been a head hunter. As said, I think he will stay in the outside and eat him with leg kicks, and then try to conter once max moves in.

I just see Aldo in a completely different level. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You cannot blame the ref when you lose 6-1.

In any case, when you have a team going mental searching for goal during the 90% of the game, with so many times the ball being in your own area, penalties are going to happen, always, it is just statistics.

The person here to blame is Emery. The first half was a DISASTER. But then in the second half, with the 3-0 and against the ropes, they did the right movements (di maria in) and PSG actually had the best opportunities there. But then for some freaking reason he got complacent, thinking the 6-1 was impossible.

If you have a lead of a 4-0 and players as good as Draxler, Di Maria or Cavani, you should always go for a trade game, instead of parking the bus badly. When PSG went to trade, they scored. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maia's TD technique is not your classic wrestling technique (like Woodley's, for example). He doesn't really need to shoot for the TD, he just needs to initiate the grappling, and considering how stationary Woodley is, that's not difficult.

Maia's stricking is not amazing, but his defence is decent. Remember that he fought against Silva during his peak.

The only question here is if Woodley will be able to connect and KO Maia. it that doesn't happen, I am sure Maia will take him down, and sub him. Remember Woodley vs Rory in the ground. Woodley's BJJ is not that amazing, and he couldnt stand up against Rory. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have watched that fight a few times, and the performance from Rory was masterful. His combinations to T-Woodley were amazing. T-Wood look like even scared. He was just moving from corner to corner, while Rory was stalking him.

Why I think Rory wins easy:

Rory's stricking is not as good as Wonderboy, but it is much better than Woodley (woodley basically has a super punch, and that's it). Rory has a super long reach (76"). He is not going to knock you down, but his combinations and kicks are amazing. Rory is not a counter fighter, he is a stalker, but he really never commits.

Rory's ground game is much better than T-Wood. He finished that fight on top, easy. He kept T-Wood down for like 2 minutes, when T-Wood was desperate for knockout. Rory made T-Wood quit. I think TWood style is just perfect for Rory.

Also, and I know that what I am going to say now is not popular, because people here follows the famous "fighting years". But T-Wood is 34 years old. He is a very old champ. Only 1 year younger than GSP. On the other hand Rory is 27.

I know that people here only follows the "fighting years rule" (Which IMO is kind of bullshit, there are a lot of counter examples, see Bisping, Overeem, Werdum, Frankie Edgar or even Nate Diaz). People with super long careers that peaked late (or kept their peak until late).

When you are 27, like Rory is (or I think he was just 25 against Lawler) you recover much faster. I can only speak for my experience, which I know it is "just my experience". But I love sports and I have been practicing them for a long time. I am 31 now, and when I was 27 my athleticism was just much higher. As a 31 year old male, after every traning season I need like 30 minutes of stretching, and my whole body aches the next day. I remember when I was 27 I could go to train and then party. I cannot imagine how it is going to be once I am 34. In the last 2 years I have been developing pains in my hip, and sometimes I cannot train at all. I doubt T-Wood is "fresh". If you see pro athletes his age, after training they need to spend 1 hour in a ice tube, and that's in sport where some sort of recovery peds are allowed (like in the NBA). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'd argue that it's the opposite in the UK. Any former Prime Minister get such vitriol poured on his/her legacy. Everyone wants to blame them for the worlds ills and anything that didn't go 100% in their time. 

My little experience with british politics is that your politicians will rarely take any blame about anything, and they will usually blame others (until now this was the opposition, like now the Tories blaming Labour for anything, or Europe).

I have watched sometimes the "questions to prime minister" or when someone ask about something like "Why X region is under funded" the answer is usually "they got less money with labour".

Obviously the "blame the previous party" is used everywhere, but not to that extreme. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Opinions about Thatcher today aren't nearly as strong as they were when she was in power.

It depends who you ask to. She was a very polarised politician within the UK. Some regions used to not care about her, some regions hated her deeply.

Those regions that didn't care much about her, which is mostly south England (so the most populated area of the UK), nowadays kind of accept her. That's why you read "good stuff" when she died, because most of the media is based in London. On the other hand, regions that hated her in the 80s still hate her nowadays. Just ask in Scotland.

The problem if you are from outside the UK (I am spanish myself) is that if you check the british media you will mostly check London centric media (BBC, The Guardian, and so and so), which doesn't really represent what the people in Scotland, North Ireland or North England might think. Like if someone wants to check what's going on in Germany will probabli check Spiegel, for example, and for obvious reasons their views doesn't represent the whole Germany.

I guess in the USA it is kind of easier, because you have big newspapers in different cities. Like you have the NYP, LA Times, WP. Just checking LA Times and NYP you get very different views on the same subject. In most european countries most of the media is based in the same city, and represents a very centric view. In Spain, for example, most of the "national" media is based on Madrid. Thus if you want to read about the spanish royal family you will think Spain has a positive view about it, meanwhile if you go to parts far away from the center, the opinion might be drastically different. But foreigners rarely check "local news". </TEXT>

I guess it depends on how you define what a "robot" is. When people thinks about "robots" they think about mechanical platforms which move and think. Ultimately the objective of a humanoid robot is to be as similar as possible to a human, from every point of view. So if you think that way, we are already robots. A big branch of robotics is about "bio inspired" systems, and they take as much as possible from biology. </TEXT>

Neighbours recommend to each other the services of Mr Jones.

Mr Smith doesn't know anyone. He can barely speak the language. He has no network. He knows nothing about UK gardening. He knows nothing about british seasons.

<TEXT> I will ignore your first paragraph and just imagine that you failed to convey your words into thoughts.

The EU has all the mechanisms the UK needs to control EU migration. It has them now, it had them 10 years ago.

If the UK wants, it can, for example, (a) force any eu migrant to get a private health insurance instead of using the NHS, and (b) set a threshold of "sufficient funds" and reject applications based on that. This can be done within EU laws and most EU countries are actively doing it. Under EU laws your freedom to roam only lasts 3 months. The EU is already giving to the UK tools to control the freedom of movement.

The Tories will never do this because it would acknowledge the fact they can solve the problem themselves instead of blaming EU. The UK is the only EU15 country which decided not to actively control EU migration, the only one. The Tories were in power since 2010, they had plenty of time to change it.

So yeah, the EU doesn't need to give the UK a "breather", because such "breather" already exists, and this is what the EU is telling to the UK. The problem is that then your newspapers are telling you something different. I suggest you start to read about Brexit reading international sources like any big germany newspaper (most of them have english editions). </TEXT>

We have watched 75 minutes of Wondery which were pure shit. It was only interesting when he was in the receiving end.

The "I am a counter puncher bro, what do you expect" is bullshit. Every time Woodley blitzed in, he just ran away instead of dropping his feet and trying to counter. he was also always very far away from Woodley for Woodley to do anything. If you want to counter, you need to offer something, a bait. Feinting from 2 meters away is bullshit.

I don't want to bring Conor here, but he is an example of a guy who is mostly a counter puncher, but that he "offers" something to punch. In most of his counters he actually receives from the other guy (like the famous 13s with Aldo), but he makes sure he makes more damage. </TEXT>

Imagine that round in reverse, the first 15 seconds you have the blitz of Woodley, the following 4:45 nothing happens. Would you still give a 10-8 for that? No, it was a 10-9.

That said, I think Woodley won, but just because I am a "pride - let's bleed fan" and I think he did more damage.

Also, I think scoring should be live. People say that "but if they know they are winning they will stall". Well, by the same reason the other guy will go harder. This is like football when a team is winning 2-1 or whatever, and the other team always blitzs at the end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before writing such a long comment, I suggest you read first. The person I was replying to wondered why there was racism against the poles, but not against the french, to which I just said "because there are more poles". If there were more french people, then people would complain about the french people.

The EU has the mechanisms in place to control migration, which the UK NEVER USED. When the UK complained about it, the EU said: "there are already mechanisms in place, why are you not using them?". Plenty of EU countries are using them. For example, to move to Spain you need (a) a job, (b) a private or public health service (and this is not the eu card, that is only for tourism and does not cover in case of residence) and (c) sufficient funds for themselves and family members. Spain can reject any EU application based on this three points, and they do, and all this is within EU laws. Not only that, but Germany (for example) banned countries from the A8 (this includes Poland) until 2011.

So instead of complaining about the EU and the fact that they never understood the problem (when the french knew there was a problem before you did, and that's why they banned east europe migration for a set of years), you should really study the matter, and wonder why the UK never used any of the mechanisms it could use. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are several studies that show that inmigration has near a 0 effect in wages. The idea that "if they leave, there won't be enough people to fill the jobs, which means they will need to offer a higher wage" is false. Why? Because if they are in such big numbers that they would have an effect on wages, they also have an effect on production and consumption. If you remove "them" from the equation, maybe then your local tesco only needs 6 lanes instead of 7, which means that the job they leave doesn't need to be filled.

There are several studies, by the way, which show that inmigration has a positive impact on economy growth, which drives wages up.

The bigger drop in wages in the last 80 years (so, from WW2), has been caused by economic crisis (like 08), which are completely unrelated to inmigrants, and very related to politicians, big companies and greed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is because poles represent a 15.7% of the total migration (including non eu), while France represents a 3.1% and Spain represents a 2.8%. 

My point being that I don't think people are racist against them just because they are from Poland, but because they are the most numerous, by a big margin. There are 3 more times poles than irish (which are the next one).

It is worth remembering that many EU countries opposed Poland joining the EU (leaded by France) but the UK was strongly lobbying for them, and that most EU countries banned their free movement for a set of years (except the UK). So it is very hypocritical to blame them for anything, when the UK government basically said "come here". </TEXT>

<TEXT> HR adquired a lot of power after the 08/09 world crisis because big companies let them do the purging. Thanks to that most HR departments have increased their budget, and also their power.

I started to work in 2003 (it was in a call center while I went to uni), and back then the job application process was way easier (that doesn't mean getting a job was easier... although it actually was, but just because the economy was better). You just sent your CV, and based on the CV is where they did they big purge, if they liked you, you got the interview, otherwise you wouldnt usually receive an answer. I am not saying this is the best way to do it, but at least it was the most efficient. I used to use a website to find jobs, and the website used to do everything for me. I only had to submit my cv to jobs, which was as easy as writting this comment. The following days, any interested company would phone me to set up and interview. That is how I managed to get 5-6 jobs between 2003 and 2007 or something like that. HR department back then was "transparent", they just handled the application and the contracts. The decission process relied on the "bosses" or the people who would directly supervise you. A 1 minute "mock call" was enough to see if a person would be able to work in a call center or not. You dont need to build a bridge with sticks.

Nowadays, because HR has more power, they also do a lot of the decission process based on bullshit metrics which are impossible to measure in a stupid exercise, like "teamwork", "openness" and things like that (you tell me how important teamwork can be in a callcenter, where you are just answering calls in your cubicle for 4 hours straight without any other human contact). Nowadays, when you submit your CV it is very strange to be rejected. They will make you go through a team interview and all that crap, which is just a waste of time. I would rather them reject me based on my CV than reject me after a 4h exercise. In "well paid" jobs, they even make you go to a hotel for 1-2 days, with loads of stupid exercises. This usually requires you to ask for holidays to your current employer.

This is because while before HR would just send the CVs to the respective team, now they get to decide who has the good qualities, and later on the supervisors would decide.

It is a lot of shit, and sooner rather than later companies would realise how much money they waste in this stupid process. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  When you play on a hilly map you just force yourself to use less fun options, that doesn't make them any less lackluster.

not really. you need to be more creative. you still use a lot of trains. you need to plan very well the whole map. and you can still build bridges or tunnels. It does require you to use all the forms of transport. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TT was my favourite game as a kid, back in the day when I had my 486 and I was around 10. I loved the music, and the art. I could play it for ages.

My favourite thing was how the time went on, and new ways of transport were added. Updating the train network with the last model, or the planes, was amazing.

I always wonder how such a complex game could run in a 486, while nowadays more advanced stuff seem to struggle to create similar complexity. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  That wasn't a particularly viable way to play the game. Immediately building up an industrial rail network is the way to go, and you'll be rolling in money before long.

This really depends on your initial map. If it had a lot of flat land surface, then yeah. But those scenarios were boring. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Initially my Arduino executes a series of PWM signals simultaneously, but after some iterations it adds around a second between PWM executions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-04 19:11:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am using 2 adafruit PWM servo shield in order to generate 25 PWM signals. In particular I am using this shield: https://www.adafruit.com/products/1411

A python script sends the commands to the Arduino (Mega 2560) through pyserial. The commands are like "A0 P1 S500\n". Each argument separated by a space. The first chooses the shield, the second one the pin, and the third one the speed.

The code running in the Arduino is as follows:

    #include Adafruit_PWMServoDriver.h
    
    #define BUFFER_SIZE 200
    
    // Init both adafruit boards
    Adafruit_PWMServoDriver pwm0 = Adafruit_PWMServoDriver(0x40);
    Adafruit_PWMServoDriver pwm1 = Adafruit_PWMServoDriver(0x41);
    
    
    int read_command(char *buffer)
    {
    
    	static int pos = 0;
    	int rpos;
    
    	if (Serial.available()  0) {
    		Serial.println(Serial.available());
    		char readch = Serial.read();
    
    		switch (readch) {
    
    			case '\n':
    				rpos = pos;
    				pos = 0; // Reset position index ready for next time
    				Serial.println(buffer);
    				return rpos;
    
    			default:
    
    				if (pos  BUFFER_SIZE -1) {
    					buffer[pos++] = readch;
    					buffer[pos] = '\0';
    				} else {
    					Serial.println("666"); //buffer overflow
    				}
    		}
    	}
    	// no end line or char found, return -1
    	return -1;
    
    }
    
    
    void parse_command(char* command) 
    {
    
    	char* parameter;
    	parameter = strtok(command, " ");
    	long shield, pin, speed;
    
    	while (parameter != NULL) {
    
    		switch(parameter[0]) {
    
    			case 'A':
    				shield = strtol(parameter+1, NULL, 10);
    				break;
    
    			case 'P':
    				pin = strtol(parameter+1, NULL, 10);
    				break;
    
    			case 'S':
    				speed = strtol(parameter+1, NULL, 10);
    				break;
    
    		}
    		parameter = strtok(NULL, " ");
    	}
    	
    	for (int x=0; x  BUFFER_SIZE; x++)
    		command[x] = '\0';
    	
      if (shield == 0)
        pwm0.setPWM(pin, 0, speed);
    
      if (shield == 1)
        pwm1.setPWM(pin, 0, speed);
    
    }
    
    
    void setup() 
    {
      
      Serial.begin(9600);
      Serial.flush();
    
      pwm0.begin();
      pwm0.setPWMFreq(100);  //Max is 1600, Kevin was using 1000
      pwm1.begin();
      pwm1.setPWMFreq(100);
    
    }
    
    
    void loop() 
    {
      
      static char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    
      if (read_command(buffer)  0)
        parse_command(buffer);
        
    }


As said, I am sending the commands from a Python script, where for example I have a function called "activate all", that will send 25 commands like "A0 P1 S500\n" (obviously with different values after the A and the P) to the serial port. I also have a function called "disable all", which is very similar to the previous command, but setting the S to 0 so like "A0 P1 S0\n".

So, as I start the serial communication, if I execute from Python "activate_all", I can how all the PWM signals are generated at the same time. I know it is actually 1 by 1, but it is fast enough to seem simultaneously to the human eye. If I then send a disable_all, I can see how all the PWM signals are set to 0 at the same time.

This works as expected for a while, but after some point, when I send an activate_all, it will indeed activate all of them, but it activates each PWM signal one by one, with a delay of around 1 second between activations (so you can clearly see them going one by one), and a very similar effect when disabling them all. From this point on, which seems slightly different each time, every time I want to activate more than one pwm signal at the same time, it will add this 1s delay between activations.

The only way I have to fix this is to send from the python a "flush()". which seems to be fix it. Doing flushes from the Arduino code, like when for example serial.available is 0, doesnt seem to fix it.

I don't know what exactly I am doing wrong. I guess the way I am handling the communication buffer is wrong, but I haven't seen where my mistake is.

A very similar code to the one pasted here was used in another project, in that case it was interfaced with Labview, and in that case everything seem fine.

In case you wonder about the code running in the Python script, it is like this:

    
    import serial, time, json
    
    
    class BZBoard:
    
    
        def __init__(self, port):
    
            self.ser = serial.Serial(port, 9600, timeout=120)
            time.sleep(2) # serial docs recommend a wait just after connection
            self.ser.flush(); self.ser.flushInput(); self.ser.flushOutput();
    
            self.motors = {
                just naming the pins
                }
        
    
        def __del__(self):
    
            self.disable_all()
            self.ser.close()
            del self.ser
    
    
        def close(self):
    
            self.disable_all()
            self.ser.close()
            del self.ser
    
        def activate_motor(self, motor_code, speed=300):
            ''' code as in A1 or C2 as marked in the actual board. See the dict motors'''
    
            shield, pin = self.motors[motor_code]
            command = "A%d P%d S%d\n" % ( shield, pin, speed )
            self.ser.write(command.encode())
    
    
        def activate_all(self, speed=300):
    
            for key in self.motors.keys():
                self.activate_motor(key, speed)
    
    
        def disable_motor(self, motor_code):
    
            shield, pin = self.motors[motor_code]
            command = "A%d P%d S0\n" % ( shield, pin )
            self.ser.write(command.encode())
    
        
        def disable_all(self):
    
            for key in self.motors.keys():
                self.disable_motor(key)
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
    
        board = BZBoard("/dev/ttyACM0")

So the user will do for example a lopp that repeats itself 20 times, where it will activate_all, wait 1 second, disable_all, wait 1 second. The first 10 iterations or so, everything will be fine and the PWM are generated all of them at the same time (with respect to the human eye), but after that, the PWM signals are generated 1 by 1, with a delay of 1s or so between them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I strongly disagree with your "once the novelty of playing on the go wears of". It never wears of. I suspect you never had a handheld console before, but I have had each of them since the game boy, and it never wears of. And games like oot or mm (Zelda's) are similar in immersion to the new one, and they are perfect in the go. You also have super deep games in the 3ds like xenoblades or dragon quest and they are perfect, and you also have dark games like resident evil DS or smt.

I think your criticism is based on someone who is not used to handheld gaming. Maybe it's just not for you  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is actually strange, because while Spain is a more religious country by every metric, I have met more religious people in Scotland.

The problem with religion numbers in Spain is that the first baptism is a very common celebration that families do for new babies. Most people don't see it as a religious thing, but as a celebration thing. And the moment you do it, you are a catholic person for the rest of your life, unless you remove yourself from the registry, which is a very difficult thing to do. I am baptised, but I don't consider myself a religious person anymore (if I ever was). But statistically I am a catholic person.

This can be extended to most religious celebrations. The Holy Week is huge in Spain, but when I was a kid and I walked around with my palm tree, I didn't give a fuck about Jesus or whatever, I just did it because all the other kids did it, and it was funny.

That doesn't mean that there is not a high % of catholics, but Wikipedia says it is a 77%, and I doubt it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Why is Ryzen performing so well in many-core workstation benchmarks but so badly in many-core games?

I have no idea, but I would say the main difference is how cores are used in workstation and in games.

In workstations, like for example when using VM, 3D rendering, compiling,... the cores are used in a constant way, long bursts. Like when you render your Blender project, the OS and the CPUs already know exactly what they will do for the next 10 minutes (or whatever). That doesn't mean there is no information back and forth betweek cores, but the OS/compiler can easily predict that. Let's say that a given core can work for a longer time on their own. VM is the extreme case, where a core is only used for 1 thing, and there is minimal communication with other cores. This also means that cores are used in a more equal way.

Games are the opposite. What a game does changes constantly, because a random person is playing it. It really depends on the game, but in a open world game, for example, the player is constantly moving in / out building, making the character to walk or to take a car, going through a shooting or battle action. There's is a constant communication witht he input, but also the shaders, rendering, models, even the sounds and music, and the on-line features. The OS / CPU cannot predict what's going to happen, because the user is kind of random. In games, cores are required to do shorter bursts of processing. Also, cores are used unequally. You might have 2 of them focusing on the rendering and going almost 100%, but maybe the other one handles sound and input ot whatever, and its needs is more dynamic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No directly blackmailed by social media giants, but politicians in some countries are already sued for something they tweeted more than 5 years ago, even if it was clearly a "joke".

In any case, I think most social networks nowadays won't exist in 30 years. Facebook, for example, is still huge, but it is losing traction: it seems young people (new users) don't use it anymore.  That makes sense when you consider that Facebook nowadays is a network for old people, because every mum, dad and every grandmum is there. Something very similar happens to Twitter. It is transforming from a social network which was used by everyone, to a social network which is mostly only used by famous people.

Back in the day I used windows MSN to chat with friends, and as far as I know that is totally dead now, and I doubt microsoft is saving any kind of chat log. I also used LiveJournal to write a blog, which now it is kind of dead, similar to blogspot. I also used to use a lot IRC, and now I only use it for dev support, and the network I used for casual chat is dead. There was also something called "fotolog", which was instagram way before instagram, which is dead now. I also use to frequent some of the old school forums (I mean, stuff in the late 90s, early 00s, not super old stuff like usenet, I mean a lot of those php forums), which now have disappeared completely. There's a rock forum I used a lot, and I had something like 10k messages, and it is completely gone.

I have no idea what young people use now, maybe that's what they like. I know an older friend has now a kid who is like 10, and he tells me he can spend hours in Twitch tv watching people play game and spamming the chat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  When I talk to Eastern Europeans about why they're pro-EU they say the same thing: Their own Government are incompetent and corrupt and they think a European one won't be.

As a eurozone member myself, I actually love the idea of the central european bank and all that, disconnected from our local government. The same way laws should be disconnected from the government (at least it is that way in my country), I think the central bank should also be disconnected.

Obviously the local government decides how to raise or lower taxes, what to do with the money and all that, but I don't think they should be able to do things that a central bank can do. The fact that it is a central european bank, it means it is really disconnected. When the central bank and the government are in the same country (like in the USA), it is just a huge joke. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As much as the american and british press like to throw shit about the Euro, and talk about crisis, members leaving and all that, the reality is that it is a very strong currency, which represents the second economy in the world, under USA, above china.

If you were in mainland Europe and reading our press, things are way less dramatic and moderated. That doesn't mean that there is no criticism.

One very thing about the Euro (which will never be acknowledged by americans or british people) is that it is the most stable currency, because it is barely linked to daily politics. It doesn't really depend on Donald Trumps, or Theresa Mays, or Brexits, or Indyref. Yes, those kind of things can happen, but the currency is governed by a layer above that, which gives some degree of protection.

I really suggest reading good economy journals from any eurozone country. If your only source of information about the Euro is the british or american press, then you got it wrong. Remember 10 years ago in the USA there were even Nobel prizes winners saying that the eurozone will collapse, and now it is as strong as ever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do agree with that, because I think people should vote wherever they live, as simple as that.

People think that their vote is something they own. They think a tiny portion of a country belongs to them, and that's why they vote. This is used by politicians and "big powers" as a good way of crowd control. It was not always like that. Not long ago it was very clear that X belongs to the crown, Y belongs to whatever rich family, and so. 

I think people in a country should be able to vote, because your vote doesn't represent YOU, but it does represent whatever you represent in that country.

For example, as a phd student, I am not voting for myself, but I am voting for your average "eu phd student". Once I am gone, there will be another one, and another one, and another one. Because the UK is spending on us on average around 300k, I think we should have a say about how to improve the situation, so that said money is better spent, resources better allocated,... academia is a HUGE business in the UK, and phd students are the cogs powering that. It is not only the money the UK spends on us, but also the money we can bring in terms of investment if our projects are succesful.

That said, I do understand the reasoning of "only citizens can vote". It is the same everywhere. They want you think that being a citizen is something precious. When in reality it is meaningless. </TEXT>

Scotland wanted to let everyone above 16 who were living in Scotland to vote. They were smart, because all those EU citizens who mostly voted NO now they would vote YES.

I was able to vote during the scottish elections too, but not during the UK national elections. That's OK for me, I don't expect to vote in their national elections. I prefer to vote in my home country. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The rules across the EU are that if you are a guest in another country, then you need private health insurance if you are not paying tax. 

This is false. A public one is enough.

There are around a million brits living in Spain. None of them have a private health insurance, because they are covered by the NHS. A lot of them get permanent residence after 5 years just because it makes everything easier.

<TEXT> I didn't have one, because I didn't know I needed one. In my country health is public, thus no one has a private insurance. I know plenty of EU students in the UK, and none with a private health insurance.

In the UK I have used the NHS a few times and never they told me I needed one. If they had said this to me, I would have paid for one. As far as I remember, also, the university never advised me to get one.

In any case, if after funding my phd (as said, EPRSC money. afaik the average cost of a life science phd student is around 80k a year, so I used around 320k tax payers money during this 4 years), the UK wants to kick me out without getting anything in return, well I will go to some other country where I can apply the expertise I learned paid by the UK. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am one of the people who is going to be very fucked. I arrived to the UK (Scotland) in October 2012 in order to do a PhD, in which I spent 4 years. Now I am working as a researcher in the same university. My girlfriend is from the UK, so in the near future I would like to stay here (no idea what will happen in the far future, I am not the kind of person who plans his life).

Anyway, when brexit happens, 2019, I would have been in the UK 7 years. But because I spent 4 as a PhD student (I was paid by the eprsc as far as I know, but it was an stipend), I won't arrive to the "treaty 5". This means that either I will need to leave, or that I will have to get a visa to stay, needing a total of 9 years (that being optimistic and considering that I will never be unemployed).

I really hope Scotland gets the independence. I already voted yes during the first one.

EDIT: BTW if my girlfriend was not from here, I would leave ASAP. As much as I love Scotland, and I would love to stay here forever, I kind of hate the UK (not the people, but the "instituion" itself). I have a good career, and I could probably find a job anywhere. But I am one of those people who prioritise family over career. </TEXT>

But then, somehow, the employer decided to hire the other one. A employer who in 99% of cases is british. A employer whose priority is money and service, and will hire the best candidate regardless of everything else.

<DATE> 2017-02-23 12:41:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> All my live since I can remember I have been using Dean Markley strings. Usually the cheapest ones they have 9-42 (searching on the Internet, they look like this: http://c1.zzounds.com/media/fit,2018by3200/quality,85/NickelSteelElSig-5ebc88ecd75967a2fc4a43a2f1eb0e95.jpg)

No idea why I always bought them. I use to break them quite a lot, and they got rusty easily.

Something like a year ago I bought a second hand american stratocaster. I haven't played it much, although I have played it a fair bit. I would say maybe around 50 hours? And yesterday I went to play it again and I realised that the strings are still perfect and clean. I would like to ask the seller for info about the strings, but I lost his information.

So I wonder, which strings do you use and recommend? I don't mind much about the budget. When I use Dean Markley, they are cheap, but I need to change them every month. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, my set up is very simple. Focusrite 2i2 direct to Guitar Rig, and from here to the speakers. I also have an american stratocaster, from which I get very decent clean sounds, but I am failing to do so with a Danelectro u56 I recently bought second hand. This guitar has lip stick pick ups.

The guitar in particular is a Danelectro 56-u2 pro (based on this website: http://www.danguitars.com/56-U2.html). It is a budget guitar, I didn't expect something amazing, but new goes for around 400, so it is not like super cheap. It has a decent sound with moderate or low distortion, but when trying to play it clean, it is just not nice. This surprised me because in my experience it is usually easier to get cleaner sounds.

This first audio I am going to paste is from my fender stratocaster, guitar rig, and "twang jazz". Pick ups are first the middle then, and then the neck position: https://clyp.it/dwcvoeel The sound is decent, I think it sounds good.

Now the same but with the danelectro: https://clyp.it/e4qtbxua In this case the first part is with the bridge pickup, and the second part with the neck pickup (I ignored the middle position where it uses both pickups). The volume knob is turned to the near minimum. Something that already surprises me is that there is a bit of distortion, when the sound should be clean. As far as I know the pickups it has have a very low resistance. In any case, as you can see the sound from the neck pickup is just horrible. For a clean sound, it sounds very muddy, too bassy, and it misses the treble completely.

I don't know what I am doing wrong. The only think I can really do is to adjust the height of the pickups, but I dont know if that will fix anything. I have never done it. I don't know if it will have an impact on the sound. </TEXT>

check how much a cancer treatment costs. your chances of having cancer are around a 50%. Check how much the private health insurance covering everything would cost. Check how much it will cost after you go through the cancer and you have your second relapse.

I am saying this because unless you are making millions and can pay a half a million cancer treatment in a private hospital, you are better off having the NHS. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Tikka taka became a whole lot less effective when teams realised if you press from the front and don't let them play in front of you (all team used to play 4-5-1 vs Barca) then you can get results. 

I disagree with this. That is what "tiki taka" wants, to pull you. Worse thing for tiki taka is to park the bus and counters (basically what Madrid or Chelsea did).

FCBarcelona havent played tiki taka since Pep left, so we dont really know how it would perform nowadays. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  E.g. Salad crops driven up from Almeria, Spain to Dover consumes 260 grams of CO2 per kg.
 
 
 
 Salad crops shipped from Miami over to Southampton would only consume 241 grams of CO2 per kg and if shipped from Haifa would only consume 197 grams of CO2 per kg.

Your comparison doesnt make any sense. By road you get the veg from Spain to the UK in 2 days, when it is still fresh. You don't need to freeze it. From USA it would take weeks, and you'd need to freeze it. Being frozen or not makes a huge difference when talking about fresh veg. And even then...

You can also ship salad crops from Spain. Distance between San Sebastian to Dover is something like 700 miles. Salad crops can be moved from Almeria to San Sebastian using train, which is the most efficient way of transport. Even better, the train connections between France and Spain are very good, and cheap, so you could move all the product to Calais, and then ferry it to the UK.

No matter how you plan it, there's no way shipping anything from USA is cheaper than Spain. Spain is like 700 miles away, while USA is 3470 miles away. </TEXT>

IMO subsidies are always better than importing, even if the cost is much higher, at least it is money that stays in the country. Every pound you import is a pound lost. That is just my opinion and I don't have any data to back it up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the "allergy" to suits is kind of bullshit. Suits are good in a business environment because they are "uniform". Everyone looks the same. It is like school uniforms. It is not about "wowing" without the value. It is just a standard way or dressing. You remove the competition and the "how cool I am" factor from the equation. You can get decent suits for 80.

The allergy of suits started as a way of "being different". "I am so cool and I get so much money I don't even need to use a suit". 

I think in Europe suits are more common (except in start-ups trying to be more american). You avoid fuckups like the NASA guy with the sexist t-shirt.

That said, the only time I have used a suit in the last 5 years or so was during my phd viva. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  They want to fish without quotas. 

Who are they going to sell the fish to?

Most of the leftovers from british quotas will be filled by other UE members. Even non EU like Norway or Iceland members will dance in happines because if there's left to fill they can do it, and they already have running agreements with the EU, and the EU won't shaft them just because the UK left the EU. And even then, if you cannot fill the quotas, then the market is open for the UK, yeah, but also for USA, Canada, China and everyone else.

So if they think they will continue to sell the same fish as they do, but not being part of the EU... I think they are in for a big surprise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fish moves. check the PDF I sent. It tells you where every country can fish in each area. 

For example, about cod, which as said the uk can fish up to 25k tonnes, it can fish around 5k in "I and IIb", 10k in norwegian waters, and the rest in "IIa and IIIa". The only part here in british waters is a bit of IIa. Everything else is in russian or norwegian waters.

If you check the PDF you will that almost every fish (I say almost because I havent checked every case, otherwise I will say just every), can be fished in different waters, and not all of them belong to the UK.

UK fish will basically be replaced by denmark, norway, ireland, netherlands, france, iceland. You might say "but oh some of these countries are not part of the UE", yeah, but they have a running agreement which I guess the UE will prioritize. I wouldnt be fair for them to be shafted just because the UK decided to leave.

Moreover, in need of even more fish, the UE can then buy from China, Canada and USA.

Whoever thinks the UE needs british fish is a bit crazy. And this by the way can be applied to almost every product within the EU. We have created an artificial market where we consume our own stuff instead of importing from outside. Olive oil, for example, is mostly from Italy and Spain, just because they are part of the UE. Same as tomatoes and plenty of veg. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never understood the position of the fishermen. The UK has BY FAR the best quotas within the EU. Every fish which can be fished in british waters has the biggest quota given to the UK. You can see it here:

https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/sites/fisheries/files/docs/body/poster_tac2015_en.pdf

For example, cod, UK can fish almost 30k tones. The dangerous dutch people who steal from british waters can fish up to 2.5k tones. Haddock, UK more than 25k tonnes, next country is left with 8k (france), Mackerel the UK can fish up to 250k tonnes, next one is Ireland with around 100k.

Just check that PDF and you will see that the lie of "the dutch stealing british fish" doesnt sustain itself after reading that for 10 seconds.

I wonder what is the business plan of the UK fishermen. Like, OK, you are out the EU, and EU countries cannot fish in your waters. Do you realize now that other countries will take over your quotas when possible? Who do you plan to sell your fish to? Do they really think that they will just get all the benefits? That Denmark will stop fishing cod so that they can sell it in the UK? </TEXT>

Maybe she opposed it before and she changed her mind. She is still very young, opinions evolve.

<TEXT> This is like the urban legend.

A couple goes for St Valentine's to have dinner in a chinese restaurant. Some hours later the woman starts to have stomach ache, vomits, diarrhea,... it gets worse and worse, so they go to AE. The woman is treated, and the doctor comes out to speak with her partner.

- Excuse me to ask this bluntly, but is your girlfriend a protitute?

- no! why?

- She had traces of semen in her stomach from 12 different individuals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if that would be possible. In a computer we are used to just get a new screen and adjust the resolution easily through the OS, but I don't think it would be that easy with a 3DS, especially because it needs to be retro compatible with everything else and I don't think game makers will ship games with higher res textures.

This is something that they had to improve from the start. the fact that it was released with 240p was a big mistake IMO.

What I would add for a new iteration is better cpu (more framerate, and less battery), bigger battery, and more ram. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  if Spain didn't still have Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa.

As happens with Gibraltar, a big portion of the people living in Ceuta and Melilla would rather be part of Spain, than part of Morocco. Although this seems to be changing because the population is going to a turning point where it will have a majority of arab / islam people, and those people are more likely to prefer Morocco, being it a Islam country, than Spain.

It is interesting how people can prioritize religion over free education / universal health system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You get what you are worth. Business won't pay more beause there's a "shortage", except when it is completely unavoidable. In which case, they will rise the prices, meaning that technically you won't get a higher purchasing power, which is the important thing. If you compare salaries in the UK with salaries across Europe in similar PPP countries (like Germany, France, Netherlands,...) you will see that salaries are very similar. Some jobs get more here, some jobs get more in Germany, but the average is similar.

If you consider the "Big Mac index" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index) you will see that in countries with a high salary the "Big Mac" is more expensive. In Denmark, for example, a McDonalds worker get a minimum of 16, but they pay 4 for a Big Mac, as opposed to 2.29 in the UK (plus the fact that someone in a british McDonalds will barely pay taxes, while in Denmark they will pay around 50 or 60% depending on the total number of hours).

By the way, I am not against the danish system, I am actually all in, and I will swap it right now. But while it works in a small country with like 5m people, something similar it will probably impossible to implement in a country with 65m people. (convince them to pay 60% in taxes). The way to rise wages is to increase productivity and cut down the extreme bonuses of the higher ups. Artificially creating a shortage of work force won't increase it, when this shortage is not happening also 20 miles away from UK in France. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Python is winning the War on Matlab.

Not really. I assume you are a "casual user" in the sense that you code your own stuff with bits from numpy/scipy. I also mostly do this, by the way. Most of my code nowadays is scipy/numpy/opencv.

Matlab has a lot of very specific toolboxes which simply don't have anything similar in Python. See: https://uk.mathworks.com/products.html

Python plus its scientific libraries implement a tiny bit of that. Civil engineers, electronic engineers, even chemists or economists still use matlab (or LabView) in the "real world". Plenty of people in the lab where I work use Matlab / LabView because there's no other way around.

Don't get it wrong, Scipy/Numpy is not killing Matlab. Scipy/Numpy is just a fraction of what matlab does. </TEXT>

People here thinks that someone is going to get married, then ask for raws and ruin the photographer career just for fun.

As you said, people that will ask for raws probably know what to do with them. In which case, very rarely  they will sign whatever they do with the photographer name. Remember, it is their wedding.

<TEXT> I am not a photographer myself. But just as a "normal person". Missing family members in a wedding is what I would consider a flagarant mistake.

If I am getting married and I don't see pictures about X or Y, I would be very very annoyed. To every wedding I have been, the photographer always goes around and takes pictures of everyone. 

Moreover, in a wedding it is very easy to see who is "important" just based on their position.

So yeah, independently of the quality of the picture, if my wedding photographer forgot some family members, I would be very annoyed. By the same reason, if an important family member is getting married and I don't see any picture of me around, I'd be confused and ask this person what happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know the exact laws, but if you work over X days in a country, it doesn't matter where you are from, you pay taxes there. In which case, these romanians workers will have a big problem, because they would only have a tourist visa in England. Also their boss would have even a bigger problem. 

People will always do illegal things. People are bringing workers from India or Pakistan. You cannot make your laws in a way to avoid "cheating". You need to have the proper safety measures within your country to detect when that happens.

no, it isn't. Unless they stay 10 years in Scotland and get the british residence.

The moment a EU national goes to England from Scotland and tries to get a job, rent a flat, get a phone,... the system would just tell this person that they have a tourist visa and that such thing cannot be made. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  not technically feasible.

It actually is. They want to make you believe it is not, but it is.

You don't really care about people physically coming in or out, and regardless of brexit or Trump's wall, that's impossible to control, because people can get in as tourist, which in the UK means to buy a 30 ryan air ticket from any EU country.

What you care about is what they can legally do. And that you can very easily control. Scotland can keep their current EU agreement, while England can ban EU national direct access to the job market or NHS, like they already do to anyone from any other country.

Politicians think you are stupid, and want you to think that it is not technically feasible because if a EU national lands in Glasgow, what stops him or her to just travel to England and get a job? Well, the travel is difficult to control, but the job (or renting a flat, or getting internet, phone, gas,...) is very easy to control. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Motivation isn't in limitless supply.

It is not only about "motivation". Being fat (when it is related to a unhealthy diet and lack of exercise) fucked up your metabolism and makes you addicted to things like sugar and fat. So there is a very real addiction that you need to keep under control.

There is also the big problem of life style. A lot of people have an unhealthy diet just because there's no other way around. Not everyone is lucky enough to have 3 hours every day to buy fresh food and cook it. Not everyone has the money to buy already prepared fresh food.

There is also a big psicological problem. A lot of people eats under stress, sadness,...

I don't know. There are a lot of causes, there are books about it. But it is not just "motivation". </TEXT>

<TEXT>  then she should be doing something to stop being fat

She is probably trying, but it is not that easy. People seems to think you can just stop being fat, eat healthy and go to the gym. People is fat for a reason, it is not just "bad luck", it is not just like buying the wrong t-shirt, that you can go and swap. Until you discover that "reason" it is completely impossible to change.

Plus there's all the fucked up metabolism and sugar and fat addiction. It is a real addiction, like smoking.

I was fat most of my life, and I tried to many times, and I always failed. Sometimes it was just lack of control, sometimes it was just bad luck (for example once when I was doing really well 6 month into it and losing weight I had a sinus pilonidal which was quite huge, and I had to have surgery and basically stop doing exercive for like 8 months).

So yeah, it is not that easy to "just stop being fat". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if you comment is meant to say "it is OK for a guy to be fat, but it is not OK for a woman".

I suggest you do a very simple experiment. Create 2 profiles in a on-line dating site. One with a picture of a fat guy, one with a picture of a fat girl. They don't need to be ugly or anything like that, just fat.

One week later check how many messages have they received. I am quite sure the fat guy would have received an average of 0.

Fat guys in the dating world are completely alienated, out of the game, classed as "losers". If they try to dress smart or something like that, then they are made fun of, called neckbeards or fedora-tips.

The main difference is that it is not OK for a guy to express his real feelings, while it is OK for a woman. A woman can say "I am fat, and it sucks", while a guy can never say "I am fat, and it sucks", unless it is meant as a joke.

Let me tell you something, I was fat, and it sucked a lot, and I don't mean it as a joke.

In the dating world, as a fat person, I felt a didn't exist at all, I was transparent, ignored. it sucked. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   While I'm sure fat girls have a harder time dating

Imagine fat guys. I was a fat guy. I tried to date. My success was 0. Not even dates, to be honest, never went to that stage. It is also a cycle that eats itself. As you are less successful, you become more toxic as a person, which doesn't help at all, and probably more fat.

Moreover, nobody gives a fuck about fat guys. While fat women have all the other women "jumping down your through about it", as you said, and saying the things like "you are also pretty." Nobody gives a fuck about fat guys.

At least that was my experience. I am sure there are super succesful in dating funny fat guys, but I have never met one. On the other hand, I met a lot of fat guys, like me, just classed as "losers".

I am not fat anymore, by the way. I changed it around 7-8 years ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Strange. When I was viewing flats that never happened to me, and I viewed flats which had other views previously.

In my experience letting agents never gave the flat to the first "ok", but said the classic "if you want it, gives us your details, and the landlord will choose among the ones who want it". It is very stupid to give the flat to the first person who wants it if there are several views arranged. It is better to wait for the candidates, and then guess who will give you less problems.

It also happened to me in few flats, that I said yes, and then they called me to say that the landlord didnt choose me. 2 or 3 days later the flat was again up for grabs, but this time 50 pounds of expensive. I phoned them and they say "the person who the landlord chose didnt want it, so we had to put it up again".

If you market a flat for 500 pounds, and you have 5 people who want it, it is obvious that you can ask more for the flat. I don't know how legal that can be though, but it happened to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  That's not cheaper than straight up making them in America.

I always felt that the fact why the MIM were cheaper was not just cost labour, but quality of materials, quality checks, expertise of the workers,...

Whoever claims that the difference between MIUSA and MIM is just 150 miles is lying. It is very true that in a blind test you might not feel the difference, but use both guitars for 10 years and then compare them. And I am saying this as someone who has MIM fenders. As an example, in every USA guitar I have opened the electronics looked way neater than in MIM guitars.

Fender can make guitars in USA almost as cheaply as they do in Mexico (I mean, the cost of labour might be 5$ an hour in mexico against $12 an hour in USA, considering they use noob luthiers). That doesnt explain the 600 dollars of difference.

They choose not to, just to keep the USA ones as higher quality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bobby Robson coached Barcelona for 1 season. His main problem here is that his style was not "FCB DNA". But then he had an amazing team, with Ronaldo on his super peak when he had knees, Guardiola, De la Pea, ...

I remember during the Brazil Carnival Ronaldo dissapeared and went there, and then there were some pictures of him there in Brazil having fun. So in the next press conference they ask Robson what would he say to Ronaldo, and he said "I will tell him, next time he goes to the carnival he must tell me first, so I will go with him".

The story of Robson and Barcelona is longer than what most people know. Robson was the all time favourite coach of our president back then, Nuez. Nuez always wanted Bobby, but it was not possible until the very end. Terry Venables, for example, who was here for 3 years, was suggested by Bobby, and the legend says that Alex Ferguson was almost signed by Barcelona as suggested by Robson, but the thing is that Venables ended up winning the league 84 85, so Barcelona couldnt fire him and get SAF instead, which was almost signed.

In hindsight it was a mistake, because the next 2 season by Venables were pretty bad, to the point that the players locked themselves in a hotel and didnt wanted to play. But then we got Cruyff, and everything became better.

EDIT just in case, Ferguson to Barcelona has been confirmed by him ""I was once invited for talks with Barcelona in London when they believed Terry Venables was set to pack his bags," he wrote. "It was Terry who approached me with the job offer in the first place, but eventually he had a change of mind and decided to stay in Spain for a little longer." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I finished the game like a month ago in the 3DS. Back in the day I played OoT, which is my favourite game ever, but I never played MM.

I didn't enjoy MM as much as I thought I would do. IMO the time limit simply kills the game. One of the best things of Zelda is about exploration. Especially in the dungeons, you need to backtrack a lot and think about the next step. You don't have time for that in MM. I had to use a guide to many times because I was running out of time and I didn't know what to do. This is something that annoyed me a few times in the game. Literally not knowing what to do. You can feel the game was rushed in 1 year.

So I have a bittersweet feeling about MM. The game looks amazing. The time mechanic is horrible. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Iirc, Barca was offered Ronaldo back in 2008 or 2009 by Man U and Barca accepted but Ronaldo refused to move to Barca and wanted to go to Madrid instead. 

I don't buy this. The reason why RMadrid bought Ronaldo was because the previous president (Calderon) had a contact with Manchester United saying they'd buy it for a set price. When Florentino joined the team again, he had to honour this contract.

Legend says, though, that while he was in Sporting, Ronaldo was offered to FCBarcelona. But Barcelona prefer to buy Quaresma instead. I think at some point that summer United had a friendly with Sportning, and they bought him in the spot. </TEXT>

He is very good, but, considering we paid for him 110+ millions, was it worth? I am not sure what to answer.

Also, from the first day he didn't really seemed to care about the club itself. He never really connected. No one will be surprised if he leaves the club in 2-3 years.

I feel like Luis Suarez connected much better, for example. </TEXT>

Neymar was only behind Messi during the first year, and for a while Messi was injured so Neymar was the best in the team. He was very good, but far away from super star like Messi or Ronaldinho.

<TEXT>  Perhaps it would be fair to say Neymar is more quicker and athletic but Ronaldinho surpasses him in technical ability.

Ronaldinho was way more athletic than Neymar. Ronaldinho was built like a robot, he was supper strong, with thick legs. Neymar is more lanky. Ronaldinho used to throw guys around just going shoulder to shoulder with the ball. Neymar cannot really take any contact.

IMO Ronaldinho was better in basically every aspect of the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a common sentence but "goals doesn't tell the full story".

Ronaldinho during his peak was miles better than Neymar. Ronaldinho during his peak was on Messi's level. Sadly his peak lasted something like 3 years because he prefered money and party.

On the other hand, because Messi plays in Barcelona we have rarely seen Neymar playing as a 10 (only when Messi was injured, but it wouldn't be fair to rate his 10 game for a few games). 

Ronaldinho is one of my favourite players ever (with Romario).

My favourite Ronaldinho goal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNvjyTDrBI

I don't know, I feel Ronaldinho was magic. I also felt Messi was magic during his first years when he was a wild winger. Maybe I am just getting old. </TEXT>

It is a gimmick that was never really implemented in a game, apart from the wow effect, and it made the console way more expensive, with subpar hardware and shitty screens, and it almost caused the console to flopped to the point that Nintendo had to lower the price a lot and bleed money.

<TEXT> I still think it is a gimmick. The fact that Nintendo released the 2DS is them saying it is a gimmick. Can you imagine a DS without touch screens? Impossible.

The 3D effect almost killed the console when it was released because at the beginning it had a very high price with subpar hardware because they compromised the hardware in order to use the 3D screen. One of the big things about the NDS is how fast it was cheap. I remember buying the Nintendogs pack for 150 euros. 

Remember that the NDS was initially 150$ and then very fast dropped to $120. The 3ds was initially $250. That's just mental.

IMO if they had just released the 3DS without the 3D effect with a lower price the console would have done much better. Anyway it is doing very well. But it almost flopped. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably this has been asked a lot, so I am sorry for repeating myself.

I got PIA yesterday and I am very disappointed with the speeds offered. I mostly want it to stream video, and the moment I enable the VPN the video goes to very low quality. I have tried in several servers (US east, UK london, UK south, Netherlands, Romania, Sweden).

I did a torrent test, and without any vpn I get around 1 to 1.2m, which is my usual speed. Once I enable the vpn, any of the servers, it goes between 50 to 250k.

In order to install it, I basically followed the info in Archlinux wiki. I installed openvpn and private-internet-access client. Then in terminal "pia -a". Then in login.conf my username and password. And finally "opencv --config" to my config file.

They offer a 1 week refund, so I think I will do it, unless I am doing something wrong that is killing it. I expected it to be slower, but it is going down to around a 10% of my real speed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If we're saying 'close fight'.. he'll need a lot more than a year to catch up with somebody who has been boxing every day for his whole childhood and adult life. Conor did box but not even 1/10 the amount Floyd has.

The only thing in Conor's favour is that if they fight in a year, he will be on his physical peak. He will be like 28-29, while Floyd will be 40 or even 41.

If it was Conor being 29 against Floyd when he was 29, then there's no chance for Conor. But the older we are, the worse our body behaves. It is just life. When MJ was 40 with Washington he was not doing the numbers he was doing with the Bulls. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When they speak about this, like a fighter having clear flaws and no one taking advantatge of it, I always think about Leo Messi.

Leo Messi, arguably the best footballer playing today and maybe in the while history only has a left leg. He is not tall, or strong, or super fast. He has good acceleration, low center of gravity and the best left leg ever. The thing about Messi is that he almost always dribble to the left. I remember 10 years when he started people were saying "he is just a one trick pony, one people prepares for him, he is done". Well, 10 years later he is still the best.

I don't know if Conor fighting is as good as Leo playing football, but being uni dimensional is not a bad thing per se, if you are miles ahead in what you do than anyone else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If there is a 3DS succesor I really hope it doesn't have a 3D screen. It was (and is) a gimmick that just made the console 50$ more expensive. Not a single game uses it except for the "wow" effect, and the hype of 3D movies and all that is phasing away. Also, the use of the double screen, while it was amazing in the NDS it is rarely used in the 3DS apart from extending the menu options and the like. I would prefer a single bigger screen.

That said, I think if there's a 3DS (or DS line) successor will greatly depend on the success of the Switch. If the switch fails, then we will see a new DS console. if it rocks, then they will merge it with the DS line as the new portable console. That's why IMO nintendo is not being 100% open with it. Same as they did with the DS, saying it won't eat the game boy. The moment they saw the DS was a success, they killed the game boy.

That said, I really hope the Switch is a success because I really like the concept of home / portable. I will wait though to see if when they remodel it or whatever they ship it with a better battery. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't miss my first guitar. It was a spanish guitar I bought more than 15 years ago for something like 50 euros. It was utter crap. Horrible neck, horrible sound, horrible everything.

I also don't miss my first electric guitar. it was a brand named "kohler" which as far as I know was only sold in Spain. It has a HSS configuration. My parents paid for it like 80 euros. I didn't like it back then but it was the cheaper one, and I don't like it nowadays. The neck feels good, and the electronics are stable even though the guitar is around 15 years old. It probably needs a refret. To make things worse I had the horrible idea of covering it with stickers, but then I didn't like the stickers to I removed them. Nowadays the guitar has a few very ugly stickers marks that I don't know how to remove.

I haven't played any of these guitars in like 7-8 years, I haven't even taken them out of the bag. They are in my parents house and I want to bin them, but my parents are not doing it because they have space. if these guitars had some value I would sell them.

I have never felt too attached to any of my guitars, to be honest. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Gate leading to the shared backgarden/parking always open lately. I did close it, but they keep it open. Anything I can do? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-12 16:23:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I live in a tenement building. There is a square formed with different of these tenement blocks, and there is a parking / backgarden inside the square. This parking is only accessible through a gate, which for the last 4 years I have been living here has always been closed. Well, it opens when a car gets it, and then it closes.

For the last week or so it did surprise me that every time I walked in front of it it was wide open. At first I thought it was just a car coming in or out, but yesterday I waited like 10 minutes and nothing came in or out, so I went to check the gate, and it seems someone is using a belt to keep it open. So I remove the belt and let it close. This morning I went again and I saw that someone placed the belt again, so the gate is wide open again.

Why do I care so much? Because I live in a ground floor with a big window giving to the backgarden. Anyone with a brick or with some sort of basic lever can easily open my flat and steal stuff (I have, for example, a Fender Stratocaster made in USA which I don't want to lose [it is actually not worth that much because it is from 99, it has a few very visible dings and it probably needs a refret, but I dont want to lose it because it is my guitar, and because a new one would cost 1000 pounds, when this one is worth at most 400], and my laptop and shit like that.). And I know that in the last 6 months people have seen some idiots trying to break in into houses through the backgardens.

I have always felt safe knowing that the gate was there closed. Yeah someone can climb in, or squeeze in while a car is going through, but that is unlikely to happen. At the moment it is open 24/7. It is also a quiet backgarden. It is not like someone breaking in a flat through the street window with people moving around. There's no one really in the backgarden apart from the odd car coming in or out once every few hours.

I don't know what to do. It is a big square so there are maybe 10 blocks, potentially a lot of users who can use that parking. I contacted my landlord but it is unrelated to him. That gate is actually there to protect the cars, not the houses. I don't know if I have anything to say about that gate being closed (as it is supposed to be), or if now I must live on knowing that it will be open 24/7. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 3 years of guitar playing is almost nothing. If you plan to be a teacher you won't be able to compete with any of the pros there. If you plan to be a studio player, no chance.

I don't really know what is your objective. Do you have a band? Do you already have something published? Do you gig?

If your answer to all this is no, then what exactly is your plan?

Studying full time and playing the guitar is perfectly compatible. You don't need to play the guitar that much every day to progress. Something like 1 hour or 2 is more than enough. You will have even time to practice with your band (if you have one).

If you expect to practice full time for 3 years and have a "break through", then it is not going to happen, especially because there's no such thing as a break through. The only way to do it is with a band, and you don't seem to have one. Because a band grows very slowly is a progressive way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I knew it was done in 1 year with a lot of content reused from Ocarina's (which is my favourite game ever).

Majora's really feels like a game which is half done. As someone else said the map feels very empty (except the main town, which is amazing, everything else is super empty). Zora's bay is a joke, a huge area with near nothing. The central map is also kind of empty. Same kind be said about the whole snow section, just a house in the middle, and then their main town only has 2 accessible portions as far as I remember. I don't know, some parts look really well done, and some parts look very rushed. 

The dungeons themselves are fantastic, and some of the pre dungeons are really good (like the pirate's one, which is amazing). This is sadly killed by the 3 day cycle, which makes the exploration a pain in the ass.

For me the worse thing is that a lot of content is "there" but there are no hints at all about how to get it. The only way is to get a guide. This is because the game was rushed and probably it didnt have a really good QA. As said, it happened to me a few times that I had literally no idea about what to do. I don't want to be spoon fed, but a lot of times after reading the guide I was kind of annoyed because that was impossible to guess. I spent around 45 hours to finish it, so I did my time.

Also, the very end, if you get all the mask the final boss is a joke. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I finished it recently for the first time. It took me around 45 hours. Overall I liked it, but:

The 3 day cycle, even with the inverted song, is horrible. It doesn't mesh at all with a Zelda game. It is like playing 2 different game. It happened me twice that I couldn't finish a dungeon in time and had to repeat parts of it and it was horrible. It just doesn't work with a Zelda exploration game. 

Plenty of times got stuck and I didn't know what to do. I'm not talking about puzzle lost, but completely lost. I've never had to check a guide so much before.  Mix this with the 3 day limit for a horrible experience.

A lot of the side stuff is IMO impossible to discover without guide. 

The fairies are a big mess. Horrible with the 3 day limit. 

Overall, it feels like a game rushed in 1 year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why?

Places like Vilaweb are very dangerous, because they are left liberal places (I consider myself a left / social / liberal .../ I have always voted for left parties). The fact that they have a political aligment similar to ours makes us blind to the fact that they are a cesspit. The_donald is in the other side of the spectrum, so we are already ready to dislike it, but with vilaweb, they upload a lot of content that makes you think "oh this is really cool", but then you check a bit more or read other sources and you are like "oh wait".

Similar things can be said about The Guardian. The main different is that the guardian has good journalists, although some other are just the left version of your average the_donald redditor. That's why the guardian is very dangerous... you have excellent columns mixed with horse shit, and you might eat it all at the same time. Vilaweb follows a similar rule, with the different that for each good column they have 9 which are horrible echochamber. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This conversation started because someone before said that "microsoft and sony are legitimate videogame companies, as opposed to Nintendo".

My point is that they are just money investors, while Nintendo does actually produce videogames. The full cycle in - house. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kojima was working for Konami, and they were making games like MGS before Sony was around.

Your sentence about Xbox makes no sense, and even then based on what you say they are just porting pc games into xbox. That doesnt make them a "videogame" company.

I am 31 years old, been playing videgames since I am 5. Do you know the last 2 games I have finished? Majora's Mask and Pokemon. Meanwhile I also play Dota2 (where I have around 1000h of game). If you like videogames, you like Nintendo games. The myth about them doing games for kids if false. Majora's mask is an example. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Sony and Microsoft are legitimate video game companies. 

what? Nintendo makes better videogames than Sony or Microsoft. Mostly everything in those companies are third parties or studios they bought. Sony is an electronic comic, while Microsoft focuses on OS and office software. They are just investors into the videogames world. Nintendo is a real videogame company.  </TEXT>

No matter how good Busquets is he will never shine as much as someone who plays in the 10 position. 

That said, yeah, Zidane was better. He also played in much better teams. And pep won the first UCL with FCB ever, so that's quite an achievement.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm running at the moment CM 7.1 and I'm not very happy. The phone lags a lot. I just tried to use google maps and it was quite horrible.

The phone came with 4.4 and as far as I remember it was recently fast. Then it updated to 5.x (the auto update from Motorola) and everything started to go downhill. So I installed CM 6.x which I have been running for a while, but I was not 100% happy, and now with 7.1 I feel it goes even worse.

I don't know if I should just buy a new phone . the phone is 2.5 years old so it is above its 2 years cycle. But I don't know if any room (or even going back to stock 4.4) will make it lag less. That is my priority, speed over features.

Thanks ! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a project like this:

http://imgur.com/a/zFS4A

The 3D scene was just created it only contains a 2D text. it should play for 2 seconds, and then the video, but instead the text plays for the whole video. Even if I remove the text, then it will just be a greish video window, and the video I am trying to load never plays.

I need to close Blender, and add the video from fresh, but from the moment I play with a camera, my video is gone.

I am new to blender, so I guess there is something I am missing.

In the preview everything looks fine, and when I move my mouse around, the video looks fine. But when I click render, the output file will only contain the text.

I have also set the background of the text scene to transparent, and same behaviour.

Even If I remove that text scene, and then move the video to the start, then from that point on only that text scene will play. See:

<TITLE> [QUESTION] Left my parents house 6+ years ago. I don't know if I should sell the guitars I have there </TITLE>

<TEXT> I have been playing the guitar for 15+ years, and I left my parents house more than 6 years ago. While I was living (until my mid twenties) I had a tiny collection of guitars (4, I had some others which I sold). My parents haven't complained about the space, and I don't really need the money (and the guitars don't have much value, apart from the sentimental one to me).

So probably most people would say "don't sell them". The thing is that I live more than 2000km away, in a different country. I only go home for holidays, which is a few days a year, and I rarely play the guitars then. On the other hand, I have with me now a guitar, so I've got that covered. Some might say "bring them with you". I studied this. On one hand it is very expensive to send them or bring them with me in the plane, on the other hand I don't really have space at the moment, and as said, I already have a guitar with me which is the one I play.

The reason why I am thinking about selling them is because I feel bad I haven't use them in 6 years, and I don't foresee using them any time in the future. it can go to maybe 10-15 years, and they will just stay put in a closet.

The guitars I have in my house are:

* My first spanish guitar. I bought it 15 years ago for like 50 euros (back then in pesetas). It has 0 value, I am going to bin it next time I am home.

*  My first electric guitar. The brand is "kohler", which was a spanish brand for electric guitars. Very nice wood body (looks exactly like this one: http://cdn.wallapop.com/shnm-portlet/images?pictureId=83835508 pictureSize=W320) sadly when I was a teenager I put some stickets, and I never managed to fully remove them. I played this guitar to death, so the frets have clear signs of usage. This guitar has a very high sentimental value to me, and it helped me going through those shitty times everyone goes through when you are 16. I bought it for like 100 euros, plus the stickers and frets, probably has a very low value now. The only thing is that I put a bridge DiMarzio X2N, so that is basically the value of the guitar.

*  The first guitar I bought with my own money after working a few months in a call fender. A telecaster MiM from 2005, color daphne blue. The strap did some damage on the side of the guitar, and the jack for the cable gives problems. At most I could sell this guitar for 200 euros, but I put to it Lindy Fralin Blues Special pickups, so that would probably put the value up to like 300 euros.

* A good spanish guitar Alhambra 7Fc (cypress body, this is a flamenco guitar). This is the one in better shape. Google throws prices from 800 to 1200 euros.http://cdn.wallapop.com/shnm-portlet/images?pictureId=83835508 pictureSize=W320

So yeah, most would say "don't sell them, not enough money value". I just feel bad they are never used, and they will probably never be.

I have been thinking about this for a long time, and I need some advice

Thanks for listening!

<TEXT> I played Ocarina back in the day on my N64, and it is my favourite game ever. So as soon as I got a 3DS I wanted to get a MM.

I just finished the first temple and I am loving and hating it, but the hate is growing strong. I don't know if I am doing something intrinsically wrong. Maybe I am missing something.

Basically I hate the 3 day limit. I feel it limits a lot my exploration / free roaming (which is something I love in Zelda games), and I am just rushing everything. I am not really enjoying the game, it is more stressful than anything. The first temple, which I just did, was super easy. The only difficult part was doing it on time.

So far 3 times I ran out of time, so I had to play the song to go back in time, which means I lose every item, so collecting stuff seems pointless. Even worse, I need to re-do a lot of stuff, and having to do things twice every time is very annoying.

Second time I was going through the temple (because I ran out of time before, and I didnt want to have to repeat everything again), I had to check a guide (something I had to do) because otherwise I wouldnt be able to finish the game. I killed the boss (very easy) and then there was the cutscene and I got the pricess, but oh well I ran out of time, so I had to play the song to go back, and book, Ive lost everything, including the princess, so I had to go back to the temple, and this time it let me fight direclty with the boss.

So I don't know if I am doing something wrong. I understand you can go back to the start, and you can tp to places where the owl is, but then you seem to lose any progress done. Is this how the game is supposed to be played? Do I have to repeat everything 2-3 times until I memorize the right sequence to do it in time? I really really hope I am doing something wrong and that I am missing some big part of the gameplay.

thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> A man spends a fortune on a horse that is supposed to be an amazing stallion. He is told the horse will impregnate 20-30 fermale horses.

He brings the horse to his farm, but the horse is not doing anything, just sleeping and eating grass all day.

Some time after he meets with an old friend, and explains the story. The friend replies:

- The same happened to me, I bought a horse that was supposed to be an amazing stallion, but he won't do anything, so I bought him a syrup drug that he is drinking every day, and from that day on he is impregnating 20-30 females a day.

So the lazy horse owner asks: 

- Do you remember the name of the syrup?

To which his friend answer:

- I don't remember, but it has a kind of mint taste. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Anyone playing Dota2 using Linux/Vulkan? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-23 13:17:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My CPU is an i5-3740s, and my GPU is an Nvidia GTX 750 TI. My OS is Arch Linux, and I am using the Nvidia drivers.

I have been playing Dota2 in my computer for years using Linux. I stopped playing for a while, and when I came back I set the launch options to Vulkan because people were reporting higher framerates. At the same time, I upgraded from a FX6100 to the i5 as said.

It happened to me then in every game than around the 38-42 minute mark the game would go to hell, and the framerate would drop by a lot. I needed to kill the game and restart it, and everything was then fine.

I asked this before in this subreddit, and some people suggested overheating issues, so I tracked it. The CPU never goes above 40-45 degrees, while the GPU never goes above 45-50 degrees, so nothing is really overheating, and I cannot hear the fans going stronger because the temperatures are always low. Before the games goes to hell the FPS is stable at 60 (I have vsync enabled, otherwise it goes to 100-120). And the drop in FPS is very sudden. It goes instatly from 60 to 5-10.

Yesterday I changed from vulkan to standard (which I think it is OpenGL), and the game went well. So I assume there is some problem with Vulkan that makes the game go crazy around the 40 minutes mark.

I wonder if anyone has any experience to share. So far I will keep the standard launch options. No idea if this is a problem with linux / nvidia / my graphic card

I also had to stop the white led, which I would like to continue using.

I don't know how I had it set-up in CM13, but I would like a similar set-up, where the screen is never woke up, but the white led flashes, and then once I start the screen I can see the pending notifications. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Glasgow city council website - constantly getting "Internal server error" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-18 18:32:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just registered to pay my council tax. I registered to 2 things, one of them a Santander bill payment thing, the other one my profile in the Glasgow Council website. 

The santander thing works fine, but the Glasgow council website fails continously giving me a "500 - Internal server error". Once registered I could go to my profile, set up my council tax and see the amount I need to pay. Then I had to login again, and I was getting that error all the time, only once 10 minutes ago I could see my dashboard again, but it logs out very fast somehow, and then everytime I am seeing the same error. No idea if it is because I am typing my password wrong (I dont think so), or the security question answer. I don't know if this is normal, if their server is going wrong, or if I am doing something wrong.

This happens both in Firefox and Chrome, and in both cases I am trying incognito mode, because my default browser profile goes directly to that 500 error.

Any experience with this? What I am doing wrong?

thanks!

EDIT: The error I am getting all the time looks like this:

Server Error

500 - Internal server error.

<TITLE> Linux with Nvidia. My game goes to hell every time around the 40 minutes mark. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-10 14:37:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the last 2-3 months, I cannot really remember, my game goes to hell and the FPS drops to like 5 (otherwise it is stable at 60), always around the 40 minute mark. I don't have the exact time point, but it is between 38-42, and it happens in every game. I need to close the game and join the match again, and then it works fine.

I have archlinux, an Nvidia gti 750, nvidia drivers.

I have always played Dota2 in Linux and it has always been good. I don't know what it going on. I have been ignoring this for a while, but the last game I played we lost because this just happen when we were pushing high ground in a very even game, it was my fault that fight was 4v5, and when I could reconnent we were all dead and they were pushing to win.

The fact that it always happens at the same moment leds me to believe it is some problem with Dota2 and not with my drivers. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Good places for a graduation/Chritmas dinner in Glasgow or outside of it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-10 11:51:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I need to organize a graduation dinner for the first week of December. Because everywhere will be doing Christmas dinners, I assume I will book that instead. We will only be 3 people, so it is not for a big group. I don't care much about the budget as long as it is not crazy (like I assume around 30 pounds per person can be decent, and we don't drink alcohol, so there won't be bottles of moet and chandon)

I know most of the common places around the west end, I also know some other plays like the three sisters, or 2 fat ladies. That's why I am more interested in places outside Glasgow. Anywhere as long as it is a 30-40 minute drive. It is usually cheaper and better. I have been for example in the Struther farmhouse which was simply amazing, and I wonder if anyone knows more places like that.

In any case, any recommendation is good! And I don't care much about the style of food. European/british/curry... anything can work.

thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Knowing this forum people is probably going to make fun of me, "loser how can you lose against 4", but it has happened to me like 3 times in the last 2 weeks (I don't play that much).

In my experience 5v4 was always an easy game. You need to throw very hard to lose it.

Also, I almost always play as support, and in all the games I lost vs 4 I was a support.

The last game I lost this way was yesterday, I was SS. They had meepo, doom, sven. I warded their jungle and our SB destroyed doom and meepo with charges from everything. Around the 25 minute mark the score was something like 20-5 in our favour, and we were destroying their towers and I thought it was going to be a fast an easy game. When the game finished I saw that the exp and gold graph was basically flat.

We lost a fight, I don't remember exactly how, and they came back hardcore. Next time I saw Sven I was level 13 I think, and he was already 19, and killed me in 2-3 attacks. From now on, they just completely destroyed us, all of them had like 5 level advatatge and almost 6 slotted very fast.

Just going through my dotabuff I can see a very similar game, we were destroying them, but the graphs were flat, they manage to get a few kills, get some space, and they steamrolled out of control. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to do it as a personal project, just for fun. I did OS courses back in the day as part of my degree, but I always wanted to write one from scratch.

Minix 3 seems the perfect option, because it is newer, but I have read it is bloated with code, and that you are not really coding one from scratch, just learning from the book. Is that right?

If that is the case, would you then recommend minix 2?

I know there are projects out there which aims to do this, but I find in most of their cases the documentation is lacking. I prefer just to read a book (I like reading books more than scroll through documentation). </TEXT>

<TEXT> My new motherboard ASRock H61M-VG4 Motherboard (Socket 1155, H61/Micro ATX, DDR3, PC-1600)  (this is a LGA1155, so it is a new mobo from amazon, but an old model), doesnt seem to auto regulate, but it runs at a constant speed. The CPU is an i5 3470s (I just bought it 2nd hand on ebay), so it runs under low temps (it seems to give me around 33-34 C under normal workload).

When I installed the motherboard initially, the fans were running full blast (it has 3, one connected to the CPU, and the other 3 from the case connected to another fan socket in the mobo). It was very noisy. I didnt know what was going on, I thought it was just a noisy fan (I bought the cpu fan from amazon, it was not a stock fan, it is Akasa AK-CC7117EP01 K32 High Performance Intel Cooler for LGA775, LGA1156 and LGA1155 ).

Then I went to the bios, and I saw that there are 2 options for fan control, temperature (which I set to 50 degrees) and fan speed (which was set to 9). I also installed the mobo software, that lets me change these parameters from windows.

The only thing that seems to change the fan speed is the "fan speed option". The temperature threshold does nothing, and when I change the fan speed (from 1 to 9) it just keeps a constant speed, whatever I set.

My understanding was that the fans would auto regulate themselves based on the temperature, but in my case, they dont seem to care. The temps are very low as said (low 30s) so I would expect the fans to go at low speed.

<TEXT> Based on EE, puppey barely plays or cares about the game. No pubs, no scrims, it seems he only plays pro games. 

On the other hand he is an outstanding player. I remember like 2 years ago when he only played terrorblade (terror being shit back then), he had like a 70% win rate. 

It does surprise me how someone can be so good playing so little. When I stop playing for a week I feel very rusty. </TEXT>

<TITLE> If I cannot see 3D, which Nintendo 3DS (or 2DS) should I buy? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-27 15:41:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a lazy eye, which means I cannot see 3D. Like I cannot see it on movies, or when I tested a Nintendo 3DS in a shopping center.

I have been playing a lot of emulation lately in Android (classic gbc games), and I want to buy a new 3DS and get new ones.

I don't know if I should buy the 2DS because I cannot see 3D, or if it even with that going with the 3DS is a better option. The 2DS is very cheap, so I don't know.

Also, I don't know if I should go for an XL, and for one of the newer models, or one of the old ones. I see the new ones have a more powerful CPU, but I don't know if that has any real effect.

Probably this has been asked here a lot, I am sorry for repeating it.

I will mostly play at home. I am an old guy, and I spend most of my day at work, where I cannot play.

thanks for the info !

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was checking it now the car park for prestwick airport, and it is around 50 pounds for a week.

This is extremelly expensive compared to what you pay in Glasgow main airport or Edinburgh, because in those airports there are unofficial parks which are much cheaper.

I cannot find anything similar in Prestwick, and only the official park is offered.

No idea is someone has any experience?

The reason why I need to park a car, is because the flight arrives very late at night, and I cannot take the train. Otherwise I would very gladly take the train. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Potato laptop with HD4000 benchmark (tldr use dx9) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-24 19:17:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My laptop uses a hd4000, the cpu is a i5 3320m and the resolution is an amazing 1366 x 768. It has 8gb of RAM, and it uses a standard HDD. It runs Windows 10 64b.

I have tested Dota2 for the 4 default video profiles (min, med, high, very high), and a extra one, which I will call "extra med", where when compared to med, it puts high textures and med shadows (med uses med textures and high shadows).

First of all, in Windows 10, gl failed. it loaded the game, but then it became frozen. So I tried it for vulkan, dx9 and dx11.

So now, the average FPS on laning phases, the order will be min, med, high, very high, extra med

vulkan: 75 - 34 - 21 - 20 - 36

dx9: 80 - 37 - 22 - 21 - 43

dx11: 70 - 26 - 17 - 17 - 34

I also tried Linux. On Linux I use Arch Linux, and my DE is i3wm, so the cpu / memory usage is minimum. And I don't have anything runing in the background. I used the intel drivers. Vulkan did not worked, so only opengl:

linux_gl: 70 - 26 - 17 - 17 - 34

So yeah, on Linux it is way worse than Windows.

Using the minimum setting the game gets easy 70 FPS, so it is very playable, but if you want it to look better, you need to set for like 30 FPS.

DX9 is the way to go, on medium settings it gives 3-5 more frames than the other options. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help choosing a LGA1155 motherboard </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-24 12:02:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> yesterday I bought a new CPU, I bought a i5-3470s to update my FX 6100. I know this might seem old and crapy here, but it is the best I can afford, and the FX 6100 was giving me problems with 1080 videos.

Anyway I am now in the search of a LGA1155 mobo. And I see them with a big different range of prices.

I don't plan to OC, or SLI (my gpu is a 750ti), the mobo needs to be mini micro, because my case is not full size.

I am a bit confused, I dont want to spend much, something like 50, and I dont know if that range will give me crap or decent stuff.

I dont know how decent something like this would be:

http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/like/111617728437?lpid=122 chn=ps adgroupid=27378760866 rlsatarget=pla-181484360946 adtype=pla poi= googleloc=1007326 device=c campaignid=620865095 crdt=0

or something like this:

http://www.kikatek.com/P296252/H61M-DGS-ASRock-H61M-DGS-Motherboard-Core-i7-i5?source=froogle gclid=COrNtsPfp88CFbYW0woduYQE4A

I dont know if these ones are decent, horrible, or if theres better stuff for the money

thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about card readers and gratuity tips </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-01 12:25:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It has happened to me lately in a few restaurants (both small restaurants but also popular chains), that when I go to pay with my card, the machine asks me if I want to give a gratuity tip.

At first I thought this was a great idea because that means I don't need to search for coins in my pocket.

But then, the question is, are the workers really getting my tip? How much of it are they getting?

With classic cash tips, workers put them in a jar or similar, and then divide at the end of the day. Some dodgy bosses take a cut. I wonder if this gratuity tip thing is a scam for workers. I understand it might work in small restaurants where the person serving you is also the owners, but I don't know about big chain.

So my question is simple, to those working in a place with automated gratuity tip, are you getting the money? Or should I ignore the option and leave my tip in cash.

PD: Please avoid the discussion about if we should leave tips or not. That's another topic. </TEXT>

97% in rotten tomatoes.

In particular the first 30 minutes or so from "A Prophet" are very similar to how Nasir is protrayed in prison in TNO. Same kind of cold approach without much drama.

A prophet is a hard movie though. There's a scene in the first 30 minutes which is one of the hardest I have seen in my life. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-07-25 11:32:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to ask, you are welcome to point me in the right direction.

I have been with Three for 4 years. Recently, as with everyone, my bill went up 6.5 pounds a month. I am paying now 20 pounds a month.

I have seen lately they have this offer about six months half price. I wonder if I could call and get it, or if it is only for new clients. In which case, I wonder if I can say "ok I leave you" and then get it, or if there's no way at all to get it.

20 pounds a month is quite a lof for what I do with my phone (wi fi all the time). My data use is around 1gb a month. I never call, and I never send texts. So I plan to change my tariff and get something cheaper, and I wonder if I could get the 50% discount.

thanks ! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The computer is a Thinkpad x230, 8gb of ram and the cpu is i5 3320m. It is not a powerhouse, but it is a decent computer. The hard disk is just HDD (not SSD).

I disabled the fastboot option because I have Linux dual booting here (Linux boots in 25 seconds)

It takes around 2:10 from power button to getting the windows sound. The desktop appears at 1:30, but most of the things in the start bar are empty.

I have tried to remove as many things as I could from the start, like I don't even start Dropbox. Based on the Task manager, everything left starting is "low" (basically audio and usb), and the bios startup is 4.6 seconds.

I don't know if this is normal. The only "strange" thing I have done is changing my user name. It is a fresh w10 installation (it was a w7 fresh, updated to w10).

There were no pending updates or anything like that, and I have just booted the laptop like 5 times in a a row, always the same result. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Isn't a huge conflict of interests that the new owners of UFC are also managing fighters? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-17 21:10:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I can see this going wrong in so many way:

* Favourable match making or title shots to their own fighters. I mean, their manager, who happens to be the same as the ufc, will only renew is the fighter gets a title shot. Ronda for example is managed by them. I don't think Ronda deserves a title shot now, after two different belt fights while she was resting. 

* Forcing fighters to be managed by them. "If you let us manage you we will offer you a better deal".

* Forcing fighters to agree to worse deals once they are inside.  As manager and owner, the fighter would be completely isolated.

In case you think points 2 and 3 are the opposite, this is what supermarkets do when they open a new one in a new area: big chain opens supermarket, lowers the prices to the point that all the other supermarkets need to close, once they are alone the put the prices high.

Considering that IMG by owning UFC what they are basically owning are the contracts and the library, I see this like the boss being also the union. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Questions about battery lifespan </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-16 12:12:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I used to have a macbook, and there are a lot of theories there about how to maximize your battery lifespan, to calibrate it,... My battery was dead after 3 years.

I just bought a Thinkpad x230 second hand, and so far I love it. The capacity of the battery is 86.74% (I think this is pretty good for second hand). Also, I am a Linux user (with i3) and I am getting 9h of battery, which is quite good.

I wonder if there is there any tips about how to maximizing the battery. I've looked around, and basically the common tip is "remove the battery when you are at home". Does this really help? If the battery is at 100% and connected to the AC, does it make a difference or is the battery permanently charging / discharging?

Do you do full cycles at least once a month? Do you calibrate your battery?

I am just interested to see what Thinkpad users do. As everyone, I'd like to maximize the lifespan of my battery, I don't want it to be dead after 3 years.

thanks !

So far I love this x230. best keyboard I have had. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-07-08 12:07:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Same stuff happened to me with the card Wonderboy vs Rory. Both cards after the update.

Watching the replay of the fights the next day is almost impossible.

The markers are completely off, all of them in 1 mm at the start. They are useless.

There is no way to navigate through the fights. Clicking anywhere in the status bar is useless, clicking directly in a fight is useless, clicking in the "fight card" button and choosing a fight is useless.

The only way to do it is to click +10 seconds. In a fight card that is 335 minutes this is a joke. If I want to watch RDA's fight I need to click +10 second for 20 minutes. But wait wait, at some point it will always go back to minute 0. Also, if I press full screen, it goes back to minute 0.

This happened during Wonderboy vs Rory and I had to torrent the fight because it was impossible to watch in Fight Pass. Same crap is happening now 3 weeks later.

All this used to work perfectly with the previous fight pass.

Fix this shit goofs or I am stopping my monthly fee.

PD: UFC reads more this forum than the emails sent to them.

EDIT: Great, after 10 minutes of clicking +10s it just logged me out so I have to do it again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was walking today around that area, and it's a big shocking. Especially the fact that Handmade Burger Co and Gourmet Burger Kitchen are one against the other and they seem to focus on the same style of cooking burgers. At first I actually thought it was the same company, but no.

Exactly besides Gourmet Burger you have Fives guys, and 20 seconds away you have Bread Meats Bread. Five Guys is the only one that is a bit different. Because it is less "gourmer" and more "american dirty".

It seems a bit crazy. It made me remember when in the TV series Deadwood they open a pub in front of his pub.

Have you visit any of them? Any good?

I've tried a Five Guys but in another city. it was OK but I wouldn't go again. I am not a big fan of bugers, though. I tried years ago ketchup in the West End and it was OK, but the last time I went it was vomitive. I also enjoyed the ones in Bruadar, but I guess no one else enjoyed them, because the place closed.

I don't really understand all this thing about burgers. It is something you can easily cook at home. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gove is born in Edinburgh. He is a British citizen. If Scotland gets independent we can assume he would be an Scottish citizen. He can later on apply for the English citizenship, but there will probably be a small period of just paper work and bureaucracy. Yes, he has been living in England for something like 30 years, but he never applied for the citizenship.

I just wonder what would happen if he was the PM of a country he is not even citizen. 

Considering how the Tories are turning into Game of Thrones, my call is Theresa May will call for the Scottish referendum just to get rid of Gove. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 1 month old SD card giving me problems </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-01 21:14:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First of all, my phone is a XT1309. And my SO is CM 13.0, just updated today.

A month and a half ago I bought the sd card "SanDisk Ultra Android 32 GB microSDHC Class 10". It is supposed to be good. I decided to use it as local disk, so everything now is installed there. It has been working fine, but yesterday the phone told me the card was missing. After rebooting it, it was fine. But today it is doing the same constantly. After 30 minutes or so it tells me that the card is missing, and the only thing I can do is to update it. I cannot take pictures or see my gallery or do anything. Removing and inserting the card doesnt work, only reboot works.

Everything seems to point to my SD card being defective, but I want to rule out first a phone / software problem. This is the first card I use. And it is also strange that after booting it works fine, so I don't know if it has a RAM / swap problem, or if it becomes corrupted after some use or something similar.

The card is almost new, just a month and a half. And it was working fine until yesterday. I don't really remember doing anything yesterday that could have stopped my card. It failed just after waking up.

I am not a heavy user. I dont install many apps, I don't take many pictures.

thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> problems with e3d v6 after a good working year </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-30 13:42:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am sorry if the title is all in capitals, I cannot change it.

I have been using the e3d v6 for like a year with very good results. Something like 2 weeks ago I tried a new filament (always PLA) and there is when the problems started. I tried for a day, but I couldn't print anything. Every time it looked fine, and then at some point it stopped extruding.

I've gone back now to my working filament (verbatim), and the problems persists.

See album attached: http://imgur.com/a/lnwtE

I thought it was more a problem with the motor and the hobbed bolt, but while it is printing the bad layers, it seems to move as usual. if I pause it, I cannot really extrude pusing it manually, but if I pull it, and push it, then it works fine again (until it stops printing).

When I pull the filament it doesn't look strange. It's not like folding or anything.

I also tried cleaning the nozzle inserting a needle through it.

I don't really know where the problem is.

thanks !

EDIT: I have replaced the nozzle and the motor driver, and the problem persists. </TEXT>

<TITLE> From an EU citizien living in Scotland: Thank you </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-24 18:56:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been living in Scotland for some years. It is the third european country where I have lived (I work in academia, researcher, high mobility), and the one I liked the most. I love its cities, its character, its landscape, and especially its people.

I remember the first time I went to a pub here, my first week in. While I was waiting to order something an old man near me started to chat with me. That had never happened to me before. We started to talk about football, which was a mistake, because at some point he asked me if I prefer Celtic or Rangers, and I said that I don't care. An answer he didn't like, so we almost had a fight, but at the end everything was cool and he paid me a pint, although when I left I said "see you later" and he said "I don't think so". 

I never knew what my future would be, but a few years ago I considered staying in Scotland in a more permanent way, and work together with you to make this, your country, a better place. I always felt welcome. That's why when the whole referendum initiated the situation started to be grim. Nothing really happened in real life, quite the opposite, every person I met was 100% remain, but the debate here in Reddit or in the main media websites was quite toxic. As a EU citizen I felt offended a few times, and the few times I ask them to tone down their debate, I was told I don't even have the right to feel offended. I started to feel paranoid and I tried to minimise social interaction with strangers, just in case.

That's why I say thank you, Scotland, for trusting us all. For making us feel welcome. I don't know what's going to happen, maybe I will need to leave your country in 2 years. Maybe I am out of a job in a year and I need to go somewhere. I don't know. Meanwhile I will try my best to pay you back. I don't want to make a politicial statement, but I really hope you get a second indyref.

From your average random EU migrant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a stratocaster from 99. I bought it second hand. The owner said that the frets were recently dressed, and they look alright.

it doesn't buzzes when played open, or the first fret, from the the 2nd on, it buzzes. It only happens on this string (it is bottom E, not e). if I press the fret very hard the buzzing kind of dissapears, so I don't know if it is my problem or the guitar's problem.

I've tried raising the action, but it doesn't seem to be a difference. The neck doesn't really look convex or hump. More like straight, a bit concave, very slightly.

I don't know if this buzzing is normal or not. or how I can solve it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I just watched TUF21, and I love it. My favourite season. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-15 14:04:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> TUF21 receives near 0 love here when people asks about their favourite TUF seasons. I think TUF21 was one of the best so far, and it did something that people always asks for: trying something new.

- The idea of gym vs gym was amazing. It gives a real meaning to teams. I also liked the point systems. Before this, TUF fighters only fought for themselves, and the teams were kind of meaningless. This meant that if you didn't like the fighters in one episode, you did not really care. In this case, you support one gym or the other, so all the fights are important.

- Having the 2 owners as leads except of UFC fighters was refreshing. Most UFC fighters are kind of boring, they just give cliche speeches, and most of them doesn't really care. The owners cared 100% about their fighters, because they were fighting for their gyms. Also, seeing all the strategy they would do to choose the matchups was amazing.

- I liked the idea of choosing blindly your fighter, instead of the winning team choosing the fight.

- Fights in their gyms were way more exciting than in the UFC Las Vegas gym. The environment during the fights was amazing, 10/10.

- The celebrations or sadness after the fights were real. In normal TUF fights the winner gets a high five, and the loser just some random words from a team mate who doesn't really care.

- By putting in more strategic chat about the fights they put in more good conent, and less house drama content. I think this season is probably the one with the less drama content, and that was good.

- Half of the fights were really good. The last one was one of the best TUF fights ever. The previous one, the biggest comeback I have ever seen, from a near TKO to a choke in 10 seconds.

- You get to see more of a real MMA gym, instead of the UFC Las Vegas gym.

I hope they do more seasons like this. I'd love to see more gyms vs gyms fights. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a stratocaster with 2 singles and a twin blade. I only get noise in positions 3 and 5, as expected. Something that annoys me is that apart from the usual hum I get a lot of noise from the computer. For example, if I move the mouse or click or something, I get some "cpu noise". I've tried searching for stuff like "usb shield", but I cannot find anything. I don't know if any of you has any experience and can help a bit. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rewatching Nate vs Conor... I don't think he threw that much, I think he got tagged a lot. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-25 13:03:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I wanted to show the fight to a friend who has never watched MMA (I think it is a great fight, short and packed with action). This is the first time I watch the fight. The first time was the morning after (spoiler free) and then the next day.

Rewatching it now, Conor threw a lot more leg kicks than what I can remember, and his pace is not as wild as I thought.  He was loading, but he was clearly not punching himself out, and between his combinations he always rested for some seconds. There's no way a top fighter would gass just throwing that volume.

When I watched the first for the first time I thought Nate was getting murdered, but watching it now, especially during the first round, Conor got tagged a lot more than what I can remember. There were the classic 1-2 jabs from Nate, which as we know, they can hurt a lot. For example, the left that cut Diaz in the brow was immediatly followed by a good right hand by Diaz that went directly to Conor's chin (similar to the one that put him on wobbly legs)

Example: https://streamable.com/3sqf You can see he gets a very good right to the chin, and just after that you can see he is opening his mouth.

Another example: https://streamable.com/sklx

Another one: https://streamable.com/6psl

There is also the famous left counter to Diaz chin, which would have TKO everyone in that division except Nate Diaz, but if you look again, in that sequence Conor eats a couple of 1-2 like the ones that set him on bambi legs: https://streamable.com/atey You can see after the first 1-2 Conor said "What's that?" A sign he was hurt there.

Finally, you can see another 1-2 that left Conor with stiff legs, although then he launches another left. https://streamable.com/pxo2 

This punches don't seem like much, but we all know that they have Power and they can decimate very good fighters (like Conor, Cerrone, Maynard, plenty of them)

I am a Conor fan, and I hope he wins the rematch, but if he thinks he lost because he gassed because he loaded too much, he is wrong. He was tagged and hurt, and you can see his face and mouth getting serious, tired, mouth open, after Nate landed those combinations.

Finally, Conor attacked his legs a lot. The reality is that he is not that good doing that. He didn't attack his body that much, but Nate leans with his head, so his body is very far back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We tend to say here that UFC / MMA is a "niche" sport, and that they cannot be compared to the american giants (NBA or UFC). I don't know why MMA fans like to see themselves as a "poorman big sports leagues".

I did a very quick test using google trends (so the number of search queries, which can almost directly relate to popularity). All the data that follows is worldwide.

Comparing Conor Mcgregor with Lebron James and Stephen Curry, during UFC 196 Conor got 4 times more hits than Lebron or Stephen ever (which was during the last finals).

Comparing Ronda with them, she never peaked as much as Conor, but during her last 2 PPV she had 3 times more hits than Lebron James or Stephen Curry during the NBA finals.

Nate diaz doubled Lebron James best ever during UFC 196.

Holly Holm got the same number of hits as Lebron James NBA last finals during her PPV against Ronda.

Miesha Tate got almost the same hits as Lebron James NBA last finals during her co main with Holly Holm.

For those of you who say "but but NBA is not that popular, NFL is the big one".

Conor McGregor got 5 times more hits than Peyton Manning during his last superbowl. Same for Ronda, but she did it twice.

Same data when compared to Tom Brady.

Conor McGregor during UFC 196 even got more hits than Messi during the final of the WC. He even beat Mayweather during his bout against Manny Pacquiao.

<TEXT> So I have a Standard Stratocaster (made in usa) from 1999. I have been offered the tonerider city limits pickups.

These pickups have decent reviews, but they are kind of cheap. So I don't know if they would be an improvement over my original pickups, or a step back.

Any recommendations?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It is been sold online. The serial number seems good. The guitar is from 1999. I have only seen the pictures. I don't know about the overall condition, so I cannot say much. In one picture you can see a chip on one of the horns. He says the frets are good and dressed. Bone nut fitted. The neck pickup is a twin blade humbucker.

I know the answer would be to go and check it, but, if its a scam I would really never know. Plus, I live a bit far away, so I cannot just "go".

That is why I would like to know if it sounds like a reasonable price.

I can read it for 10 minutes but not for 1 hour.

I wonder if there is there any book, documentary, tv series,... that will explain me what happened in Scotland, from the first settlement (pre romans) until nowadays. Although I am mostly interested on the story between the first settlements and the union. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-01-03 17:53:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've started to do some raw processing, first time in my life. I'm using ufraw and gimp, although I'm trying to do everything in ufraw and in gimp I only scale down the image.

I've watched a tutorial where every element of ufraw is explained, but I don't really know how to do the stuff. Like I'd there's a very white portion how to get more detail, or the same when a portion is too dark. 

There are a few curves and tools and I don't know how to apply them, apart from the very obvious.

I don't know if there are some basic tips I can use to improve my pictures.

Thanks ! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Careful with Uber, it can be a scam (west end to airport 30 pounds) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-30 10:23:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know that Reddit is filled with Uber shills, so I expect to receive some slack here. I just went from the West End (byres rd) to the Airport, and it costed me 30 pounds. Usually I do this with Hampden, booking through their app, and it goes for 15 pounds. In the rare occasion I use a black cab it cost me 20 pounds, hell, even the airport cabs cost me like 20 pounds too.

Some friends have had very bad experiences with Uber, but here in Reddit people seems to love it. So I decided to try it today, bad idea! When I went to book the taxi, it says there was a surge of x2. I now I shouldn't have used them, but I was stressed, with the bags, didn't want to lose the plane, so I took it. I just arrived to the airport, and boom, 30 pounds.

the x2 surge is bollocks. I have heard about this before (something shills forget to say). A wednesday 845am I never had a problem to find a taxi, and never Hampden complained to me about being busy or anything. In the odd time maybe Uber is cheap (the standard fare 15 pounds is the same as a private hire, so not that cheap), but in any decent timing, they are going to rape you.

Don't use Uber unless you are rich.

Also, the guy went through a longer route than expected. Cabs always from my house take west, through the tunnel, M8 and airport. This guy went to charing cross to take the M8. I have heard also before about their "strange" routing. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was today in a plane and sitting besides me there was an old woman who was a retired designer. Somehow the conversation went to how most stuff is designed by men, and she was saying than in general they are "bad" designers. She said this in a joking way, and she put as example the airport we landed on.

I never thought about this, but it'd actually make sense that depending on the sex of the designer things are done one way or another.

Do you think you could be able to tell the difference ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard/read a few times that they mostly offer their service in the south of the city, although I have used them to go from the West End to the airport, it happened to me a few times that the driver said he is not used to go to the West End, but the airport is a good trip.

I wonder if they would take me from the west end to Buchanan bus station, or if you recommend me some other company than can do this. (plenty of times Uber tells me there are no taxis available in the west end, so I don't want to take the risk, because getting that bus is quite important) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Stop comparing Ronda and Conor </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I see a lot of people here happy Ronda lost (I am too) and expecting Conor to lose in a month so that Dana cries. Conor and Ronda are different in every point of view. Their only common point is that they are the biggest PPV draws in UFC at the moment. Some differences:

- Ronda was undefeated. Conor already lost twice.

- Ronda was undisputed champion, and defended her belt several times. Conor hasn't even had a single championship fight yet.

- Ronda has good grappling and submission. Conor has good striking.

- Ronda fought near amateurs until yesterday. Conor has fought against the best possible FW guys except Aldo. Guys like Poirier or Holloway are very decent fighters.

- 99% people thought Ronda would win. Being optimistic, maybe a 50% expects Conor to win (probably less, if Conor loses that wouldn't surprise to anyone, in fact, Aldo losing would be more surprising).

- Everyone seem to call Ronda the best fighter and woman athlete on planet earth past present and future. No one considers Conor the best UFC fighter (although he is one of the best).

- Some people thought Ronda excels on her weak points (boxing, striking). She even thought she would beat a box champion. No one considers Conor good in the ground. He knows it is his weakest point. No one out there says "Conor would take NCAA wrestler champion".

- Ronda had no game plan, and very low fighting IQ. Conor's fighting IQ is among the best (watch TUF), and his game plan is usually on point.

- Ronda is training in a shitty place, shitty coach, shitty camp. Conor has a good coach, good camp. He is known for travelling around USA and Europe visiting gyms. 

- Ronda seems to be very unstable, only supported by yes people. Conors mentality is very strong. As said, he already lost twice, and he is here. He was punched hard by Mendes and taken down and kept his fresh mind.

- We saw yesterday Ronda has no chin. Conor has a pretty good chin.

- Conor has some banter running, he is always having a laugh. Everyone knows he is just kind of playing a character. Ronda looks out of character, she seems like an immature spoiled kid who is offended someone fights against her.

That said, I am a Conor fan (he is the reason I watch MMA). Also I respect Aldo a lot, so I think it is going to be 50 / 50. I love Conor's banter. if he loses against Aldo, I don't really care, it is part of the game. I think Conor is mostly supported by a small vocal minority of hardcore fans, while Ronda was mainstream. Maybe the mainstream will abandon Ronda, but I don't think we will abandon Conor. </TEXT>

I want to get a new extruder and replace it. I can see in the website it says something like extruder starting kit, but I don't know if this is what I need.

<TITLE> Rent penalty notice to landlord. Is this true or a scam? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-12 14:59:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have received a letter from the Council (in theory) saying that my landlord has received a rent penalty notice. It says that I shouldn't pay him rent, but once he fixes it, I will pay him back (and all the money I will miss to pay).

I don't really know if this is a scam or not. I prefer to keep paying him and ignore that letter. I don't want surprises. But there are a lot of things involved that makes things complicated. If I don't pay my landlord, he can just get angry and kick me out next month (it is a rolling contract, I have been in this flat for 2 years, and I want to stay another year). If I pay him, once he fixes the situation he may "claim" again all that money I shouldn't have paid, making me pay twice. I pay him through direct debit. So there will be a written statement in the bank.

I have contacted my landlord, but I haven't received any answer so far.

Are rent penalty notices normal? Should I be scared?

I have a good flat and I don't pay much. I don't want to move. I know people who just got a flat and in general they are paying 100 pounds more than me. Also, my landlord is cool. He never appears here, never. And he fixes everything very fast. He just got me a new washing machine with tumble drier for example.

I don't know what's the best route. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We were supposed to land in Edinburgh but the pilot landed in Glasgow instead. After waiting for 2 hours we went from Glasgow to Edinburgh.

The flight took exactly 20 minutes from take off to landing (ignoring taxing). It was 2 minutes maneuvering out of Glasgow. Then 14 minutes straight line. Then 4 minutes to land. The plane went a bit over the sea and then turned into Edinburgh.

We never went to cruise height or speed. I'd say at most like 10k feet and speed maybe 300mph.

All in all, the train is way faster considering all the time padding that flying requires. </TEXT>

So, do you have any recommendation for places where we can enjoy the weekend mostly indoors? I'm not a big fan of macro complexes like Cryeff Hydro.

Also, we don't want to be around Glasgow / Edinburgh, but not very far away. Somewhere you can drive in 2h, 3h at most, but if its near like loch Lomond, that's good. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There is someone from Taiwan who since 1 month ago, more or less, is trying constantly to steal my Facebook account, and my Hotmail account. My username for Facebook is my hotmail e-mail.

So far this person has failed every time, but it is getting very annoying getting my mail or my facebook blocked almost every day. I have changed my passwords so many times that I don't even remember them anymore, so I carry with me a piece of paper (I know this is unsafe as hell, but I have changed my password like 30 times).

As said, this person blocks my hotmail almost every day, so I need to change password and receive a message to my phone to unlock. Also, almost every day too I think s/he manages to log in to my Facebook, because I get that warning about "did you log in from Taiwan?". I have changed my password to completely different things, so I guess somehow this person snipes my Facebook password. I can only think about my Android phone.

I am from Europe, so I have no relation at all with Taiwan.

My Desktop computer is a Linux, which I would say is safe. I also have a macbook, which as far as I know is safe. And then my android device (I never log in to my hotmail through Android).

I don't know what to do, apart from keep changing my password every day. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Yesterday night Scotrail (or Abelio) kicked me out the train in the middle of nowhere. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-19 11:48:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It happened around half past 10. I was 6 or 7 stops away from my destination, when the train stopped in a station for like 10 minutes. The driver said something I couldn't understand, and most people (there were like 10 people at most in the train) left it. The ticket collector came and said that there was a problem ahead, and that there would be a delay. He then came again like 5 minutes after that, and told me to leave the train because it'd terminate there. The moment he said that, the train started moving. It went on for 2 more stations, and then it stopped, and the ticket collector told me the train would terminate there. He asked me where I was going, I told him, and then he told me to wait there for like 20 minutes (half past ten, middle of fucking nowhere) to catch another train in another direction, and then make another change to my final destination.

So I stepped out of the train, in the middle of nowhere, alone. I went out the train station to see if I could see a cab or something, but all I could see were pubs, old dudes very drunk, and track suits, so I went back to the safety of the train station.

I have to say I am not from Scotland (or the UK), so I had no family or closed friends to come and get me. So I started to panic. Anyway I was lucky finally I could get hold of a friend who came and drove me home.

Shouldn't Scotrail (or Abelio) have a cab service or something for this kind of situations? </TEXT>

<TITLE> It seems people is selling their flats to let, while more and more student accommodations are being built. Is it the end of the private market? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-15 15:31:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In my block (and the next one), where I rent a flat, in the last 2 months there have been 4 flats in the market. I have been there for 2 years, and I have never seen anything similar. It seems that the new laws against "buy to let" is pushing people to sells their flats. On the other hand, in the West End they are building more and more student accommodations. The situation in that sense is getting out of control.

I think most people is happy that the "buy to let" landlords are getting a bad a time, but on the other hand, they are the ones keeping the prices low. Student accommodations are a complete scam, and it seems they will be the only option in the near future.

As an example, at the moment I live alone in a studio, paying a fair price to a private landlord. if my landlord decides to sell (and I am kicked out, which may happen any given day, because I have been there for 2 years with only 6 months of contract and then rolling), it'd be completely impossible for me to get my studio in a student accommodation, because the price almost doubles. In a student accomodation, my only solution would be to get a room, and pay even more than what I am paying for my studio.

I am afraid in the near future the private landlors may dissapear, and we will only get these huge companies with huge student accommodations. At first I was happy about the new laws against "flat to let", but now, checking prices and doing numbers, I realise this people are the ones keeping the prices low, and by a big margin. A top room in a private flat in the West End goes for around 400 pounds a month. If you go to a student accomodations, prices start around 550 (and that's their worse room, way smaller than the one in the private market), something similar to what you can get in the private market goes for like 650-700. Studios go for like 800-900. Also, they force you to a full year contract.

I am not from the UK, but it does surprise me how is it possible that so much money can be charged for student accomodation. Before coming here, I lived in Denmark for 3 years, where I paid around 200 pounds a month in a student dorm (all included), I had friends in Germany who paid more or less the same, and I had friends in France where they got it almost for free. </TEXT>

I have heard there's a bus that goes this route for late flights, but I cannot see anything. On the other hand, the taxi may be insanely expensive.

<TITLE> blob detection and tracking recommendations? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-02 11:23:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I will start by saying that I use Opencv and python, although I don't mind using another library or language.

I had this post 2 days ago:
https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/3f9zl7/how_can_i_detect_when_2_objects_merge/

One of the problems I have is the detection I would say. I use 2 ways, one is a MoG of Gaussians which works very well, except when the droplets are static for too long, which then it thinks they are part of the background. The other way uses more classic image processing, with watershed algorithm and distance transform. This fails when the droplets move too fast, because in a given frame they are a blurry shape (I am working with 30FPS).

I have been checking some of the literature, like the "idtracker" which was published in nature methods like half year ago, but their image processing seems very basic. or the droplets computer, which was published in nature a few months ago, but again their image processing looks very basic.

I have also done a quick "blob detection opencv" search, and again most of the stuff looks very basic, which just color segmentation or so. 

Also, I forgot to mention, the droplets are not always a circle. I tried using the hough transform, and it failed.

I dont know if theres any algorithm or existing library you can recommend me.

thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Imagine a 2D plane where rounded blob objects are moving. Sometimes these blobs fuse, sometimes they don't, sometimes they split. I have quite a lot of blobs, it can go from 10 to 20.

I am trying to get when they fuse. So far I have used the average size of the droplets, and when the size increases we can assume there has been a fusion. While this works sometimes, it also fails a lot.

I also have to say that my image processing works quite well, but sometimes it can miss a few objects on some frames because they move very fast or because they go outside the viewport and they enter again, and this creates problems when just testing for area. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am learning LV and I have a kind of messy VI that does quite a lot of experiments. So far I use a text file where I save the results, but this is a very suboptimal solution. It works, but I have problems recovering through executions, or problems getting the data back in fancy ways (like let's say, give me the experiments which had an output bigger than X. Yes I can do this with a script, but a normal DB manager would returns this by default).

Anyway I would like to use a better DB manager than just a text file. I have experience programming, where I have used Mysql stuff or nosql stuff. So I don't really care, both of them are good.

What's the easiest/best way to go? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Moto G 4G: Horrible performance and battery since update to 5.1 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-12 20:05:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a moto G 4G. Before upgrading to Lollipop I was amazed with this phone. I have recommended it to other 3 people who bought it.

Last weekend I updated it to 5.2, and the phone is now a clusterfuck. I have cleaned the cache and I also did a factory reset. The phone feels sluggish, but to make things worse, the battery is draining at a very fast speed.

With KitKat my battery used to last like a day and a half. I use to charge it around night, and the next night the phone was still around a 20%-40%. Now, same use, the phone is below a 10%.

The phone also seems to get more hot when I used it. It is something that never happened before, but now, if I use the phone for a bit, the back feels hot. Google Chrome is now a piece of crap. Any website that has some content, freezes. There's a blog that I always read, which used to work perfectly, and now I cannot read it anymore. Also, when I use Reddit is fun, and it open a google chrome website, it just gets stuck.

Something else I have detected is the brightness. The phone looks less bright now. With kitkat I always had the brightness around a 20%, while now to read I need like a 50% or a 60%.

My question is, should I downgrade to KitKat or should I try another ROM with 5.2?

Is there any 5.2 that fixes it, or all the same? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I work quite a lot with image processing to detect stuff. I usually search for features, clean the image, hough transform, colors, background substraction... all these techniques which have to "learning step". I'd classic image processing.

I have seen lately (although this is quite old) people feeding images to some AI/ML to learn "stuff". I know a bit about NN, SVM and so. But I am missing the link between the image and the ML. Are images sent raw? pixel by pixel? Fourier transforms? Are only features after some image processing done?

It would really help me if someone helps me fill this void. Either with an explanation here, or with some papers, tutorials,... I really want to integrate some ML in my work, but I don't see how to make the step from "image" to "input vector". </TEXT>

<TITLE> I just got rape by a Pudge CM lane </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-08 14:33:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This happened in 2.2k. It was a single draft, I chose Troll Warlord. I am dire. I go top, somehow I am alone there. Lycan jungled autistically all game. Mid drow. Bot clinkz disruptor.  They are SB who goes against our bot, centaur same, slark goes mid. Pudge and CM go top. We expected Pudge mid. I think "ez game". Slark mid vs Drow, 2 melee cores vs a clinkz who will farm safely. I am alone, I don't like that, but it is OK.

Game starts. I am farming easy. Hitting almost all the creeps, harrasing Pudge. CM tries to harrass me, but that draws the aggro, creeps hit her lvl 1, I almost killed her, but it didn't happen. She goes back to safe. I am getting levels fast. I tunnel vision farming. Suddenly a hook appears, instantly CM freezes me. I am dead. "Oh well, I will be careful next time". Disruptor comes with me. They hook and stun me again, I save my life with like 10 hp. Russian pudge writes something I don't understand. I go back to lane, after a few LH they hook and kill me again. "Bad luck", I think. I go back to lane. They do it again, they kill me again. Suddenly SB appears and destroys our disruptor, he has like 2 levels of advantatge. Somehow Slark also destroyed Drow in lane. They start to 5man top, our Lycan is still farming. I move bot. SB charges and kills me. They get our lycan. From that moment on, SB just charges and kills everyone, CM and Pudge go together, performing their deadly combo. I am in base, I cannot leave. Pudge hooks from low ground, but fails. Im underfarmed, underleveled. 

Game is done, 30:03, 46 to 11. I am 1/13/2. They finished with 25k exp plus. Their slark is 19 with skadi bkb shadow blade. I am 10 with morbid mask.

This lost was mostly my fault. I was raped by a CM Pudge combo lane. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Build Help] Computer for heavy computation (upgrade from AMD opteron 6276) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-07 11:38:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At the moment I have an AMD opteron 6276. I didn't build this computer, I was inherited it. It is a computer to be used for "heavy computation". But it doesn't have a GPU, so we cannot offload anything there, and although the CPU has 16 cores, each of them is very weak. It also has 32g of ram

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

It will be a heavy computation computer. It will be connected to the network, so I will use it from my computer and offload computation there.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

No gaming at all. A GPU will probably be needed to upload computation, but I am a noob with this so far, so it is better to concentrate in a good CPU.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I am not sure about this. My initial idea is to just replace the opteron by some intel machine, but I guess the RAM won't work because it is "server ram". I'd say the budget is around 2k-3k.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

UK

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

I am sorry to say I have no experience building this kind of computers. I was thinking about a Xeon, but I don't know if they are for servers or heavy computation. So I don't know if it will be better to go for one of the best and latest i7 (or if there's any other possibility at all)

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**
I think I said everything. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Was the ban of FPH a test to see how their "anti-streisend effect" bot worked, being prepared for what the uproar of Victoria being fired would create? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-03 18:51:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I remember reading when the FPH happened, and I think it was in KiA, that the main objective of that was to see how their control of a Streisend effect worked. FPH uproar lasted a few days, but I just to check the all - rising constantly, and whatever bot they had did an amazing job shooting down anything about FPH, to the point that today, 2 weeks after, the uproar is dead (before the Victoria stuff, I mean).

Some people thought that that "bot anti Streisend effect" test was because: a) Something big was going to happen or b) To make the place a "safer" place against those kind of "attacks".

So, what I think, when FPH was banned they already knew Victoria was going to be fired. In fact, they knew the community would go mental once she was fired, so they implemented a bot or whatever to control the uproar. That's why they banned FPH, in order to test their software-bot. A few weeks later, after seing that it works, they decided to make their big coup, and fire Victoria. </TEXT>

I have been trying a lot of "supermarket" chai teas, and none of them were "what I expected". I've tried almost all the variety of Twinings, Pukka, Yogi Tea,.... some of them were better than the others.

So my question is, what's your favourite chai and how do you prepare it? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Beginner] Most of my pictures are artificially too bright, how can I solve it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-01 14:26:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a Sony RX100 MK1. It is the first "decent" camera I've had in my life. I bought it a few months ago. I live in Scotland, which is usually a very cloudly country, with not much sunny light. Two weeks ago I went to a nice place (east coast of Scotland, near England, a very nice place called St Abbs Head), to take some pictures. I also went to visit some castles near there. The day was as good as you can get it in Scotland, almost no rain, but cloudly, almost no light from the sun.

After taking the pictures and going through them, I had two main problems. First of all, the nature pictures I took were kind of "grey - pale - boring". The day was not nice, but my pictures made the things worse.

Second problem, especially the ones I took around ruins from castles, the pictures were too bright, artificially too bright. It is like the camera tried to compensate for the lack of natural light, and it made things worse.

An example of what I mean: https://flic.kr/p/uTAPZS

Top of the picture you can see it's so bright it is white, when that was the sea, the grass also looks too bright.

How can I fix this? If you go through my pictures, you will see the same in a lot of pictures.

I am just starting, so any criticism is very welcomed. I am a total beginner. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am 0-5 with the hero. I only play him because he is my hero challengue for a long time. I only play him when he appears in Single Draft, All Random or in Least Played, never in All Pick, never ranked. I don't feed. But I am completelly irrelevant. My team plays like 5v4.

I start with him in the jungle. Yes, I know offlane is better (there's no such thing in 2.2k), or even in lane. The problem is that I am completely unable to do anything in lane. In the jungle I am usually in top of the levels and gold. I build midas fast, and then radiance fast. Jungle is the easiest way, so I cannot negotiate that, really.

From that moment on, I am completely lost. I have no idea what to do, how to maneuver. In team fights they always target the druid, and kill me easy. When I try to be careful, the bear is out of range, and only radiance is not enough.

I use the simple 1 for druid, 2 for bear, 3 for both. I build almost everything for the bear. Usually the druid only has tranquil bots

Can anyone provide me some basic tips to be useful? Some basic info to win a freaking game with LD? I even lost 1 game where we were 5v3. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Intel or AMD for low budget gaming laptop? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-05 15:26:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know that "low budget laptop" and "gaming" should never go together, but I am one of these users. I only play Dota2, and to put things on perspective I play sometimes it on my Macbook 52 2009 (13 inches with an nvidia 9400m). I also have a low budget desktop (fx6100 gtx750ti) where I play mostly and where I can max Dota2 1080p.

I need to update my Macbook (as said, bought in 2009), and I am aiming for a low budget 13 inches laptop. I had it very clear that I was going to buy an Intel one (i3, maybe i5) with just an iGPU (Dota2 runes there very decently).

But yesterday I saw a benchmark comparing the intel CPU and AMD Apus. Intel CPU completely destroys the APU as "CPU" but for gaming it seems that some of the APUs give a much better performance. 

So I don't know if I should go for a Intel or AMD laptop.

My use is going to be mostly watching movies, twich, website and play Dota2. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about building a model from experimental data, and representing it </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-01 12:23:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have some experimental data I have built through simulations. This data has around 1000 points, although I am generating more. Each data point has 4 inputs (although they sum 1, so you can say it's really 3) and 1 output (in this case it can go from 0 to whatever, the max so far is around 15).

Something important is that given the same input points, or very similar input points, they may not produce the same output value (although hopefully they will!), but it may happen that given 4 values I run an experiment and it gives me a 0, and then I repeat it a few days later and it gives me a 10. Although, as said, there's some repeatability, but even then, it is very strange to produce the exact same number. That's why I said I need first to create a model from the data. And then I need a way to visualize it. Searching on Google I can see this may be called "fitness landscape".

My idea, given my knowledge, is to use a normal neural network, backpropagation. 4 inputs 1 output, feed my data to it, iterate until the error converges, and then get like 1000 equally spaced points, use them as input, and plot its output.

I am wondering if there's a better way to do it. I don't want to go "hardcore", I only need something that would produce a nice visualization.

So far I have done everything on Python, although I am open to try Matlab and maybe R. I am also very welcome to use any library or other software. I was searching for a package that would help me, but I cannot find it.

If you think this is the wrong subreddit, please forward me to the right one.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why aren't patch cycles shorter? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-16 12:07:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A common answer given to people complaining about the current patch is that "6.xx was worse, Y hero was more broken". It seems to be a common trend that the game is patched, we have like 1 month of fun, and then the meta game is discovered and we have 3 months of shite. Last year it was the same with Tinker, Razor and DP. I remember when I started playing it was all about Naga and Morphling.

It doesn't matter how IF fixes this patch, after 1 month there will be a meta game, and everyone will spam the same heroes, and everyone will be tired again. For a few weeks we will be happy, "It's great nyx naix and DK are back", and then, same shite.

My suggestion is simpler, make shorter patch cycles. Some people may say that the long cycles is because IF is studying the meta, trying to hit the right key. It's obvious he is failing to do so. I don't blame him. We will never have a full balanced patch.

By this I don't ask for a patch every 2 weeks, but I find it unacceptable that we have had the same patch for 4 months. You know something is very wrong when the 2k trench (my trench) is spamming trolls and sniper. I mean, we are still playing 2-1-2, we are still rocking riki the pub stomper. When pro meta comes to us, is because the meta has been here for too long. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My MMR has not improved in a year. How can I improve my game? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-05 16:58:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My dotabuff: http://www.dotabuff.com/players/27401366

I calibrated something like a year ago, just after hitting level 13. I calibrated to around 2150, which is the same MMR I have now.

I stopped playing RMM for like 8 months, focusing only on UMM, thinking that after those 8 months, and a few hundreds of games, my MMR would go up. I was wrong. My record is 6-7, and to be honest, I feel the people in this skill is much better than me. For example, my last 3 games I was the main reason my team lost (troll, lion, pugna for a combined 3/35/27). I felt completely outclassed. 

The strange thing is that if you check my trends in Dotabuff, all my stats have gone up during this time. My GPM went up to around 40, my XPM around 30, my LH/10 around 5 (and I play a lot of support). On the other hand nothing of this is reflected in my games.

I also feel like I know a lot more about the game, heroes, items, builds. In fact, I am surprised 8 months I had the same MMR as now.

I would really appreciate if someone can check my dotabuff, and recommend some tips to improve my game. I don't really know what I am missing, apart from pure skill learnt while playing. But I think I am missing something. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tips for omni </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-05 09:59:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll start saying that I'm a 2.2k. It's strange because I calibrated there, and I'm 50% since then although I always feel I suck.

Lately I played a game with was perfect for omni against WK pa axe viper and silencer. So 5 core greedy lineup. Silencer countered me badly but in theory omni was perfect against the other 4. We were bara, lion, sniper, antimage and me. I thought our draft was better, and we got destroyed in 30 minutes. I was 0/7/6 and I sucked. I have around a 60% wr with oomni but I always feel I sucked, just walking around, healing, and using my ulti. I'm pretty useless in lane phase. I don't know how to have impact apart from that. I built arcane and meks. No money for more.

My lane was against WK and silencer. Offlane. I was with bara who basically run around, so I was left alone, I couldn't stop the free farm of WK and I couldn't farm myself.

So, any general tips for omni? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a VI that makes thousands of experiments. Each experiment takes a few minutes. I need to save for each experiment the inputs, the outputs, path to pics, vids,... This was before running on Python, where I used mongodb and it was fine. Now all is ported to Labview. It is working, except the DB.

So far I am using a simple txt file, but this solution is really bad.

Anyone here using any db, mysql or nosql or variants? Does labview offer anything similar by default? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spaniard here. I used to watch all your games when Sergio and Rudy were there. I think that second unit was amazing.

This weekend Sergio and Rudy (and their team, Real Madrid) won the Copa del Rey (it is a mid season top 8 direct elimination tournament done in 4 days, quite important here in Spain, NBA should implement something similar). Both of them were amazing.

Who really surprises me is Sergio. In Portland (I never watched him before) he had an atroicous long 2p and 3p. Here he can shoot, pass, do everything. He's been doing amazingly well since he returned to Spain some years ago.

Highlights of that game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2xT1p1smqU

Sergio now looks like this: http://www.abc.es/Media/201309/16/sergio-rodriguez--644x362.jpg </TEXT>

<TITLE> Reprap I3 missing Y steps at the start of layer, and driving me crazy </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-18 10:53:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [picture](http://i.imgur.com/FBvhAld.jpg)

This has happened easily for the last 50 prints. In fact, I don't remember a good print from this printer.

Things I have done: playing with the pot in the pololu driver, changing ALL the electronics (complete new set of arduino ramps and 4 new stepper drivers), new Y endstop (in case it was activating randomly), repath all the cables to make sure nothing pushes the Y end stop, put a new Y stepper motor, slowed down the print to 60%, try new firmwares, and play with the parameters.

I don't know what to do next. To put things on perspective, when I built this one, I also built at the same another exact printer, which works perfectly. (I also have another 2 i3 I built before, which also work).

The only thing that is left is to change the linear bearing in the Y axis, but if it was a bearing problem, I suppose it would be more constant, not only at the start of a layer, maybe once or twice per print.

Any suggestion? I will try anything, as crazy as it can be </TEXT>

<TITLE> The false moto of "reaction time peaks around 20, then it goes down" in e-sports. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-09 15:21:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For those of you who don't know, today team EG played the the DAC Dota2 tournament finals, which is the second biggest e-sport tournament ever, in terms of money. One of their player is Sumail, from Pakistan, and he is only 15. On the other hand, they also have a player called Fear, which if I am not mistaken, is 26. During the broadcasts, and here in Reddit chat, it was common to read or listen the "what an amazing reaction time Sumail has, this is because he is only 15".

We have heard a lot in terms of e-sport, people saying that players peak around 18-20 because that's when they have their best reaction time, and from here it gets worse.

There have been several studies, but none of them are really statistically meaningful. For example, [this one](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094215) says that reaction time peaks at 24, which is actually quite high compared to the general moto in e-sports. Problem with this study is that it only focuses on SC2. The older you get, the less time you have, hence your skill is lower. Most people above 25 needs a job to survive, and they cannot devote 6 hours everyday to SC2, and they did when they were 22. Nevertheless, that study shows that someone who is 26 is as good as someone who is 18, which already goes again against the "older less reaction time mantra".

There has been a lot of research done in terms of random population doing reaction time tests. From an e-sport perspective, most of them are meaningless. On top of it, a lot of them give contradictory information, claiming different ages of peak. Most of these studies, by the way, put the reaction time of a 15 years old as worse than someone around 22.

As an example of general research related to reaction time, this one: http://www.optomotorik.de/blicken/age-e.htm gives a peak just before the 30s. I am not claiming this to be right, because you can find similar research which points the peak around the 18s, 20s or almost every number.

Very importantly, when talking about reaction time, there are 2 different concepts. One of them is Simple Reaction Time (SRT). This is pure raw reaction time. The second one is Choice Reaction Time (CRT) This means, not only how fast your nerve system reactions to something, but also how fast that reaction is analysed, and your brain and body outputs a good choice. I think it is obvious that this second option is what we want in videogames.

When tests about reaction time are done, they almost always focus on SRT, where they do tests like this: http://getyourwebsitehere.com/jswb/rttest01.html I think it is obvious that this simple test cannot be really extrapolated to the complexity of a videogame.

This research, for example, analyses both: http://www.utoledo.edu/healthsciences/depts/kinesiology/pdfs/Reaction-Time_article.pdf

As you will see, early 30s is the peak of CRT. There's a reason why Football QB peak during their 30s, or why soccer GKs peak around their 30s, or why the mean of F1 drivers is around 30 (Schumacher won 5 titles in a row between 30 and 35).

<TITLE> What's next after GA? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I will introduce myself briefly. I have some background in AI and ML, and I have worked with basic techniques like ANN, GA, RL, SVM,... the kind of things you learn at university.

Lately I have been using GAs a lot to optimize real world experiments. It is automated via a robot. In this sense, GAs were perfect because they are unsupervised learning (and I don't have as much data as a aNN would require) and because they have on-line learning.

So I want to learn more about techniques in the same line of a GA (or even variations). I will apply them to my real world experiments.

I know this may be a bit specific.

Thank you! </TEXT>

<TITLE> After upgrading computer from Intel GPU to Nvidia flash videos are not as smooth </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-25 13:18:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have an i5 4430, the browser I am using is Google Chrome. For like a year its only GPU was the igpu. Something like 2 months ago I upgraded my computer to a nvidia gtx 670. It goes much better in games, for example, but video flash (like netflix) is not as smooth. For example if I'm watching a movie and the camera pans from left to right, it would stop for a fraction of a second a few times. In general the FPS are low, you can really feel it, and I get kind of sick.

This doesnt happen with vlc, for example.

Also, the Intel GPU seems to have disappeared from the computer. I thought the OS would always use the Intel except for gaming (I think this is what happens with a amd GPU I have) but right now with this computer it seems to be nvidia all time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of years ago I played a Machiavelli game using an internet forum (not exactly e-mail, but we used to pm the GM). It was based on a Legend of the 5 rings scenario, and I was just a player.

I want to replicate this with a group of workmates. I don't really care if it Machivelly, Diplomacy or any other game. A person, likely me, will be the GM, and they will share with me their turns.

We meet every day (we work togethers), so there's no real reason for e-mail based, apart of making it slow paced during days. We cannot really sit down 12 hours, but we can invest some minutes every day.

I wonder, which game do you recommend for this? And any software to manage it? Any experience?

Thanks! </TEXT>
