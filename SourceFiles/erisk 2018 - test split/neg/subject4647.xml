<TEXT> I am not right. The sources and the history I cite is. I didn't document them. Nor is this emotional topic for me. But as a general rule of thumb I don't like when people ask for a source on a topic they know little about, get a good source, then without a source of their own dismiss what they see. Granted you didn't quite do this. You at least acknowledged there is something and said you would look into it rather than saying *no the source is wrong*. But at the same time you aren't saying about the source other than *I'll give it a raincheck*  

And you are wrong about modern day Russian oligarchs not having ties to ussr  oligarchy, but that is a different topic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It proves exactly what I said. It isn't a theory either it is what happened. If you don't want to believe it I don't care, but your rejection of history won't change it. 

So here is what we can do since the ball is in your court. You can get your own sources and play ball or we can call it a game.  

Don't ask for a source for common knowledge if you aren't willing to accept it. There is millions of sources on it as the elitism and corruption of the elites in ussr  is well documented. Good luck showing otherwise.   You would have easier time denying the holocaust.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, you arent aware. 

There is what you want to happen and what will happen. If they arent institutionalized they will institutionalize themselves with their own private police force and militaries. They have resources to build them. Maybe they will be replaced by some ruthless warlord type who doesnt respect their wealth, but then you have a dark ages strongest barbarian becomes leader type situation. 

That is who you want to empower, ruthless rich people or ruthless/cunning warlord types. 

The issue is the system is not strong enough to deal with those that would subvert so they can control it. We need more checks and balances to stop the republicans, and their rich backers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would never beat you down. But yes someone will. Your ideology fails to understand the world. There are very bad people in it that would kill or enslave you without a thought, or with pleasure. 

In a system of no rules they make the rules. Only united and together can we stop them. That cost money. 

They promote your ideology to try and get people to remove the only obstacle from them having absolute power. Right now they use their money to have a lot of influence but it isnt the same as direct control. To do that they need to kill the beast. Make no mistake they want the same thing as you, then you will meet the real beast.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not saying you are calling for violence. You are calling for something foolish that leads to violence against the ideals you believe in. 

The Ayn rand banner is put forward by the corrupt elite who work with Trump. In the absense of a democratic government and a just society that looks after its people, it will be replaced by a dictatorship. 

The Mercer's and Trump want to kill the beast too, so they can become the beast. Either you get a dictatorship or you get a brutal dogs eats dogs anarchy. 

If you want to end the state you need to build up the people, create ways to ensure wealth is shared and people are taken of, and build a system so robust that even in the absence of a state it can exist. 

Nobody takes libertarianism seriously except for libertarians, which you obviously are. The thing is your beliefs are not beneficial to yourself, as libertarianism will end in either a left or right dictatorship. Dont be so quick to kill a beast that keeps a much more vicious beast from devouring you, but you never need to worry as what you want isnt happening.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The irony here Ayn Rand is that your own belief leads to all of these things you mention. 

Your view lets the wealthy plunder everything and pursue these stupid policies you mentioned, and then force the cost on others under *taxes are bad.*

Starve the beast philosophy with taxcuts is always coupled with authoritarianism. They just want an excuse to fuck over 99% of Americans to benefit the rich. The theft here is from the rich not paying taxes.

<TEXT> Russia did not have great economic growth. it simple recovered to where it was solely because of oil prices. It should have much higher growth. 

Putin is part of a bigger problem. A corrupt oligarchy that has always controlled Russia. They hijacked USSR and hijacked Russia after USSR. They ran Russia pre-USSR. They divert the anger from themselves to others. 

Maybe Putin, Le Pen, and Trump voters lost in life. But the thing is hatred of them wont make them change. It will just make them more fascist. People dont turn to fascism if things are going good for them. 

Putin and Trump dont mind people not liking them and the people who turn to them. They thrive off it. What scares them is showing their followers there is a better way. Putin didnt invade Ukraine because he really felt NATO or Ukraine is threat. Rather he is afraid if Ukraine joins the EU it will succeed, and Russians will want the same for Russia. Same for Trump, he isnt afraid of progressive policy, he is afraid people will see it work and not let it be reversed. 

Trump and Putin arent wrong. They have every reason to fear progress and a better world. You are helping them by embracing hatred. We dont have to like them or approve of support for them, but we need to help the losers of the world, and you cant let them know they are losers or you think they are losers. People dont take kindly to being looked down upon even if the criticism is valid. 

You either need to help them rise up, or put them down. I find the latter unacceptable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Things weren't good in russia. Everything was not perfect and they suddenly did this. 

They aren't bad people. They went from a mighty empire to a collapsed state on verge of failure. The promised benefits of their new found change did not benefit the average russian. The world forgot about them. Same with trump voters and Le Pen voters. Sure many are scum but most are people forgotten by the world and in need of help. Their feelings of powerless becomes fascism.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most Americans don't want the EU to break up. The ones that do are known as altright. They want it to break up because their views perfectly align with Russian propaganda and they view the EU as a *SJW gay feminazi Marxist jewish islamist* entity. I am not even joking. I wish I was being sarcastic but alias no. People are this stupid. 

To be more elaborate. 

*Do they know how to works?*

They think they do. To them it is part of some gay Jewish conspiracy to make the world islamist. 

*do they view it as a threat*

Yes. They think eu wants to force them to convert to Islam and become gay. Possibly jewish too.  

*Is it because trump or someone us told them to hate it and they mindlessly do so* 

Yes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Russia already has a fucked up economy, and not due to anything west has done to it. 


The bad Russians are just a few people. Yes they are terrible but Russian people are hurt more by them then we are. 

Russian people need our help. Russia collapsed twice within a century. We didnt help either time and look where it led. We are in this together, we need to unite with Russian people to get rid of Russian oligarchs and their puppets in the west. If we abandon Russia it will become spawn point of chaos. 

Putin is a competent version of Trump. Imagine how scary that is.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> What you think is irrelevant. If I wanted to post more and make money I'd instead use bots through dozens or hundreds of different accounts and post to way more subs. 

Furthermore trump is the rallying cry. People lose interest if you go too complex. They are angry right now at trump, you turn the attention away from trump you lose the audience. You keep it about trump and slowly feed them redpills.  

And I would tell you if I made money. There is no rule against doing that. The truth is if I was doing that you wouldn't be able to tell because it would be spread over many accounts.  You would never ask any of the bots because they would all seem normal.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't post all day I spent little time on reddit. I just use basic automation to speed up posting. I can post hundreds of articles about trump in a few minutes over many subs. I spend maybe an hour or 2 on reddit each day. 

Secondly trump is just the trigger. He is a symptom of a bigger problem. In the past people never bothered to really look at our system but thanks to trump they are now. I view trump as a positive he is the cause of the downfall of the whole rotten system.  

The real question is how did things get so bad that trump could win.  </TEXT>

I don't know many Republicans that are literally *everyone but me*. Rather it is they have a skewed view of America due to propaganda where they see 2 groups. *god fearing hard working honest (white) people* and then *lazy degenerate who want their support but hate them (brown/atheist/hippies/gays*. The irony is the creative classes in cities support these poor rural white folks but they are low information and think that minorities and gay anarchist are living in SF mansions off their minimum wage work.  </TEXT>

Conservatives have given up with their insane policy. They let smart people make the policy now, although they pretend to be against it when they aren't in power.

<TEXT> lol again, you admit it is trumped up charges and you even admit you cant prove any crime here. 

I dont dispute that 10-20 people took actions that constitute as breaking the law. in most cases they didnt even commit felonies but misdemeanors. Maybe 5 people committed felonies that day, and in most cases they would give 4-5 of them the option to plead to a misdemeanor. Maybe 2 of these people being charged would normally be charged with felonies in this situation and that is a big maybe. This would hold true even in the most backward regressive southern state, and much more so for DC. 

Your only defense at this point is point to an actual crime that maybe 5 different people committed and then justify this charade by saying *but they wore black*. 

That is why America and the world is shocked with this. Furthermore, 99% of these people will be committed since they are innocent, but they are going to have to spend money and time to fight when they are obviously innocent as punishment for making Trump butthurt. 

What you are defending is injustice, and you know it. 

If it were up to Trump he would have thrown everyone who protest him into jail, but not even the GOP would support that, although they have tried to make protesting illegal before. So they do the next best thing, find someone breaking the law and use it as an excuse to charge everyone that is within 1km of them protesting with the same crime.

<TEXT> MP is more fun when you play with friends, but still id rather play single player. Playing BF with 2-4 friends you still mostly play against strangers. 

I mean if you can get a whole team together that are friends, that can be fun but usually I prefer single player. Granted I dont play a lot of FPS games or RTS, which seem to be best at MP.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> lol, per your own statement there are 2 people possible guilty of felonies which are usually brought down to misdemeanors. 

Ever single instance you can name shows 3 people maybe should be charged. 

So as we can see hundreds of people are being charged for felonies when you admit and your own sources show they were not involved in any rioting or doing anything illegal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> lol, maybe 3 people committed felonies, and maybe 10 misdemeanors. People are just being harrassed for peacefully protesting on trumped up charges. 

As you admit there is no precedent for this. Basically if someone is rioting and people are peacefully protesting per your logic they are guilty of rioting and can have their lives ruined. This isnt legal in any way, it is just a Trump backed witch hunt as democracy degrades. They even tried to charge journalist with felonies for covering this. This is BS and you know it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You mean mass charging hundreds of people with felonies for being close to a very few people who may have committed very minor felonies, but almost always would be charged with misdemeanors, is not normal? 

This whole thing is highly odd and unprecedented for decades, and the fact that they are charging felonies with people who were in the general area makes it all the more stronger.  

This is clearly Trump influencing things behind the scenes because he is butthurt they ruined his inauguration.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> idk, 

here are other capital cities for comparison, note as of 2013 density was believed to be 10528 (probably a little higher now):


London 14k

Madrid 14k

Berlin 11k

Brasilia 1.5k

Ottawa 900

Astana 4100

Riga 5800

Stockholm 9300

Amsterdam 12100



As we see DC is bigger than many of these and not too smaller than most of these. I mean yeah compared to really crowded cities like Manila, Beijing, Tokyo (basically any East Asian capital), India, it is small. But for a capital it seems pretty standard. Life in those mega crowded cities isnt great either.  </TEXT>

Trotsky was an idealist who believed in communism like IS believes in islamism. He wanted to not focus on rebuilding the USSR which suffered WWI, a civil war, and famine but to ask people to take the revolution to Europe which likely would have united against them.

<TEXT> likely USSR would have collapsed. Stalin beat Trotsky by using common sense. 

USSR was a mess. Trotsky felt they needed to expand the resolution and spend what little resources they had to try and make western Europe, especially Germany Communist. USSR has recently gotten out of WWI, with great loss, and went through a civil war with great loss. After civil war there were famines. 

Instead of improving things for people in USSR he would have asked them to sacrifice more to antagonize more powerful western states. 

The west would have united against the USSR which was a mess at this time and crushed it, and the people of the USSR would have revolted against the communist. 

Stalin was not an isolationist. He believed that the USSR needed to be rebuilt first and made powerful, and then they could expand communism. This made way more sense, and it literally worked. When Stalin died a huge % of the world was communist or leaning toward communism.  </TEXT>

Furthermore that was the most dishonest attempt to whitewash the slavery in dubai I've ever seen. You basically got data foe the UAE and claimed the UAE was just dubai. Firstly UAE slavery levels are high as it is, due to dubai. There isn't 10 million in dubai and you know that. Ironically you proved my point as slavery is so bad in one city it makes the whole country look bad </TEXT>

I cant promise you a good reception here but you are welcome to stay as long as you like and say what you want. Or you could stop being a cuck and just join us. Triggering trumpets is fun, if you tried it you might like it, and it isnt that hard. It is like blowing up fish in a barrel with C4.

<TEXT> Again I don't care who you voted for. The fact remains the only people who will benefit from the tax cuts are the rich, and especially the mega rich.  Most of the rich hare trump too and will hate him after tax cuts. Who the cuts will hurt is his base. Poetic justice i get. 

Trump isn't bringing back jobs. Automation will bring a very few low paying jobs back but robots will get them and the money will go to the programmers and engineers in Silicon Valley who hate trump. This will happen regardless of who won. His base will remain poor and their situation will only get worse but under trump and Republicans they can feel safe knowing there will be no safety net or aid for them. Poetic justice again. I don't need or want trump's aid especially at expense of his base but he is giving me it while ducking over his own supporters. 

Your trailer park will die. Those you hold dear will die of heroin, Alcoholism, obesity, depression, poverty, disease, etc. Trump won't help his base. 

Honestly trump mostly benefits me. I actually make good money so his tax breaks will benefit me and him killing off low iqs  betas like you also benefits me. Still I am not cruel and would never support doing this to pathetic people like yourself. I actually want to help you. You genocide yourself and for that I have contempt for you.  </TEXT>

Anyway keep up the *winning* may trump's next 100 days be as succesful. Watching trump and his trumpets get triggered day after day has been the best thing about the presidency. Your butthurt is only starting so I recommend you get over it. Your butthurt is my amusement

I agree that the USSR is what probably set back Russian culture. Russian culture was not at the same level as say French, Italian, and many Western countries but it was unique and beautiful in its own way. USSR spent decades discouraging it. And now Russia is now longer shackled by the ideology but the general environment in much of Russia is not too friendly to producers of culture.  </TEXT>

Fascism is the parent of nazism in a parent child relationship. Nazism is an instance of fascism. A subclass if you will. Not all fascist are nazis but all nazis are fascist. 

So no I can't agree because it is contradictory. I'll agree that nazis  were worse than the actual fascist party in Italy under mussolini.  However, the fascism we are talking about is the ideology named after the party. 

Fascism is the ideology. Nazism is an instance of the ideology. It is like saying what it worse *Marxism or the bolsheviks*.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1 and 2 I agree with. 

3 I cant say. A subset of fascist worse than Nazis could emerge. For instance take the Ustae, they werent Nazis but they were just as bad as Nazis. They killed far less people, but that is because they lacked the means too. 

So 3) depends on what fascist we are talking about. if we are referring to all fascist that are not Nazis I cant agree to that because there are other fascist as bad as Nazis, or potentially worse that have already existed, or theoretically could exist.

I will agree Nazis are worse than the vast majority of non-nazi fascist that have existed. 

I would hope no worse group will ever emerge, but knowing history I am sure one will at some point.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems like you are being stubborn. I dont even know what you are talking about to be honest. I said a few wealthy elite have always controlled Russia's wealth, even during the USSR period. I just clarified the wealth distribution during USSR was bad but slightly better than normal Russia. 

You then proceed to go into a *USSR was awesome!* You then start comparing quality of life between the height of the USSR and the immediate collapse. What you are whining about has nothing to do with my point. 

I never said the USSR was good or bad. It just collapsed because it wasnt economically feasible with their command economy system. This isnt Reagan era propaganda, it is economic fact that is proven by history. Nobody disagrees with it, except you. Not even Putin would disagree with this. 

Like I said you are resorting to *2+2=454 and anyone who disagrees is brainwashed by Reagan era propaganda.* 

You dont even know Reagan era propaganda because a complex economic analysis of why the USSR collapsed is way too advanced for Reagan, the republican party, and their base. 

95 was worse because in 85 the USSR was on the verge of collapse, and in 95 was post collapse. It is like a axe swining toward your leg was 85, and you couldnt move. 95 was an hour after an axe cut off your leg. Neither situation was good, but 95 was worse, but 95 was a done deal before 85. 

Now what you dont realize is I never made this point you keep ranting about. I never said 90s was better than 80s. I just said Russia always had a very few people control all the wealth, even during the USSR except it was a little better. Somehow you took this to say *90s were awesome and rest of USSR sucked.* In fact this whole *fall of the USSR was inevitable from the 80s* wasnt my original point that set you off. It was a sidepoint during your long inane off topic rant. 

So I think I see what happened. You misunderstood me. Ok fair enough. 

But to address your point here. No you are still wrong. In the 80s Russia's situation was like having testicular cancer where your options were either remove the testicles or die. Real shitty situations. 90s was after the procedure, it was worse. Still from the 80s USSR was dead. Killed by its command economy. The economic system was bad. It worked if everyone had a shitty life, like under Stalin, but once life got ok, still far from the west, it couldnt last that long and collapsed. That is a bad system, sorry friend. 

And yes Romania like all other countries that were communist when the collapse happened hurt. that is what happens when your whole economic system crashes. 

Even the nationalist in Russia, like Putin, dont disagree with me. They are angry at the USSR too. They loved how much power and states it controlled but they hate the communism and the command economy that ultimately brought it down. 

Reagan did not beat the USSR, the USSR killed the USSR. It could have survived if it made reforms like China in the 70s.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A little better, but it doesnt need your excuses for earlier behavior. Look its forgotten about. 

Secondly, you fail to understand the situation in the 80s. The reforms you speak of are mostly after the USSR already collapsed, you are missing the reforms that matter. The whole centralized command economy stopped working in the 70s, the Russian leadership ignored it because all solutions involved ideological reforms that went againt communism. In the 80s they would have ignored it too, but the whole USSR started to fall apart so they had to do something.

They tried to make reforms in the 80s, but this just gave people a taste for better things, which sped up the demise of the USSR. The reforms you speak of are the ones they came up when the decided to end the USSR, the decision was made by then, or after it collapsed. 

Nobody disagrees the USSR states, and all communist states that were satelites, had bad reforms that did not work so great. The issue though is these reforms were the ones when they called it quits because the command economy couldnt be saved and they wanted to transition to capitalism. The death of their command economy was set in stone long before this happened.  </TEXT>

If you felt I was wrong than in a civil manner explain why, and feel free to uses sources. You didn't do this all you did *what you said triggered me so that makes you indoctrinated*. 

It was pathetic of you, and that is why you are mocked now. If you want a do over I'm nice enough to let you try again. Or you can dismiss yourself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> lol, and you sound like someone parroting some Stlain era indoctrination there man. 

See, boiler plate denials wont help you. I can take your whole comment and change Reagan to any number of Russian leaders and I said something that applies to you and is as stupid as what you said. The fact that you need to do this just shows how weak your argument was. 

Russia was a superpower before Stalin. If it wasnt for Stalin there would have been no WWII, so assuming you are right, and that is big assumption, Stalin saved Russia from the mess he created. 

*But when you say that USSR did not colapse because of the so-called reforms in the 90's , you are either just that indoctrinated (and i say this because i know this was the official natrative in the USA , all the time , but taken to indoctrination and propaganda levels during Regan era) , or lying. USSR never rose to the west s level , but a great part of that was because it was allways locked in a cold war with the west. However , it did manage to rise from the ashes of WW2 and stand up to America for 50 years.To dismiss that is...missinformed? arrogant? .*


Secondly, you proved you are either very ignorant or very indoctrinated. The reforms that are relevant are the ones made in the 80s before the USSR collapsed, not the reforms after it collapsed. Your argument is basically *the reforms made to the USSR after it collapsed caused it to collapse.* Not only do you not understand history but you do not understand time. 

(and i say this because i know this was the official natrative in Romania/Russia , all the time , but taken to indoctrination and propaganda levels during Putin era) , or lying. 

See what I did there? 

After USSR collapsed there was a deliberate effort to ruin Russia, by other Russians, but Russian elites always did this so this was nothing new. Before USSR collapsed there was a deliberate effort by Russians to ruin Russia. Like I said /r/anormaldayinrussia for Russia. Putin is just another corrupt Russian oligarchy that got lucky with high oil prices. If , however , you seem to be getting all your info from Russian propaganda media , you wouldnt know this , as..surprize! Russian propaganda media lies most of the time on anything reguarding foreign politics and things outside and inside of Russia. You wouldnt know that Putins main oponents are anyone that isnt an oligarchy. 

Back to the topic: USSR collapsed because they waited too long to make reforms, and when they make reforms they were rushed and implemented poorly, but either way it was pretty doomed. 

Just to be clear you going *2+2=593 is correct and if you disagree you are brainwashed American!* does not help you. It makes you look bad, and it actually contradicts your point and makes you look brainwashed. Just giving you some advice. Your argument would be better without the ad hominems and generalizations. If you need to resort to calling everyone else brainwashed, then you are the brainwashed one.

<TEXT> Russia was a superpower before USSR. Imperial Germany and much of Europe was terrified of Russia. 

Russia given its population and resources, should always be a superpower. Right now Russia is much weaker than it really should be, this was also the case during USSR. Russia due to bad leadership never meets its potential. 

And USSR collapsed not because of reforms but because the whole economic system was on the verge of collapse. They didnt decide to do reforms for shits and giggles, but rather they realized the whole thing was about to explode. Granted the reforms didnt really work either, but the USSR was beyond help by then. USSR needed reform decades earlier, and probably at a slower rate. By the 80s, Russia did not have decades to implement slow reform, so they tried rapid reform, and that did not work. There was not going to be a good outcome regardless of Russia did. 

Your typical Russia vs USA, *yes Russia sucks but USA is worse!* is not needed. I realize some people feel the need to always do this, but here it isnt really appropriate. You are not even disagreeing with what I am saying, but just feel the need to arbitrarily compare Russia against something else to feel better about it by thinking it is better. 

Here are the facts. A small wealthy elite has always controlled all the wealth in Russia. Since the first Tsar. Even during the USSR. So really this headline could be called /r/anormaldayinrussia since it is pretty normal. Yeah 90s were tough, that is what happens when your economy collapses, things generally arent good. Still if you knew more of Russian history you would know USSR went through much tough periods than the 90s. As did Russia itself. 

Again you being from Russia, Romania, USA, etc. does not change this. I dont care where you are from nor does anyone else.

<TEXT> It sounds like you are the one is indoctrinated. Soviet Union also had vast inequality and a few people having the wealth. It was just almost everyone was equally poor instead of having wealth gaps, but these existed too between areas. 

I agree Russia had it better at some times during ussr comprared  to a few years post collapse but there big periods during ussr, such as much of stalin's time where it was a nightmare.

Where I am from and where you are from does not change this. So as we see you seem to have either agenda or are indoctrinated   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I kinda agree with you but not in the way you said. EU, US, and China arent a direct threat to Russia like Russian propaganda makes them out to be. 

Rather they are threat to Russia because they have succeeded where Russia failed, and it raises the question to normal questions *why arent we successful like them*. The answer of course is their own leadership. However, their leadership distracts them by making these countries seem actively out to get Russia and blaming them for their own failures. The thing is I think the Russian leadership actually believes this idea, they have always been paranoid so they go out of their way to try and make everywhere else like Russia. If EU, US, etc. were just as bad as Russia than maybe things arent so bad in Russia. 

Unfortunately GOP want US to be like Russia.  </TEXT>

I never supported HRC, she is just long gone and reminiscing about how much you hate her is the only way you can come to term with Trump's failures and how he let you down. 

It is sad to watch. For your sake you better hope Trump isnt 8 years, because the shortcoming of Trumpet lives will only get worse. Trump is basically what he accused HRC of being. You basically voted for a demented male version of HRC, and your only coping mechanism is remembering HRC. #sad </TEXT>

<TEXT> the decline in Russia is not from US or EU. It is rotting internally. The economy never recovered from the collapse of USSR and the only reason Russia looked to be improving was the high price of gas. Now that it collapsed Russia is declining again. Russia lost its influence in CIS because it really has nothing to offer other than bribes, cheap gas, or weapons or military support. It has little cultural, economic, or technological capital like more advanced countries because it lacks the climate to generate these things. 

The issue is the Russian leadership has never acknowledged the rot in Russia is from Russian oligarchs and elite class, and not from outside forces so they spend all their energy and wealth to make trouble abroad while russia collapses internally. Russia is really good at makijg havoc in other countries but it doesnt solve the problems of Russia so Russia finds itself in chaos too.  </TEXT>

Russia just exploited how weakened our democracy was from the GOP and the stupidity of GOP voters. 

Honestly, Russia is really doing us a favor here. Our democracy has become a joke, and this is due mostly to the GOP who has became undemocratic, racist, theocratic, and authoritarian decades ago. It is time people realized the system doesnt work.  </TEXT>

I honestly think he did us a favor in the long run. The fact that the GOP is the way it is, the EC system, and such shows how bad our democracy has gotten. It was never perfect but this is probably the lowest its ever been, the fact that they could so easily exploit the GOP shows how much the GOP has corrupted democracy. 

Russia had bad intentions but it could end up improving our democracy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ? 

Not sure what you are saying. 

My guess is you meant to say that most Americans agree more with democrats on economic issues, which is true since Republican economic policy is just tax cuts for the rich. 

THe GOP is out of touch with 99% of Americans since its policies are just geared toward the insanely rich or theocratic evangelist, and it uses racism to get people to support a party they agree 99% against. So yes I agree with you here. 

On most issues 99% of the people would agree more with the Democrats, except the racial issues which is all the GOP has to give tax cuts to the rich. It isnt even really a party anymore since tax cuts for less than 1% of the population is not an ideology.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The book would have been OK had she not repeated the same 3 scenerios  over and over 400 times. 

Basically all her characters fall into 4 categories,  a good category and 3 bad and the whole book is the good category talking with the bad ones one at a type over and over. The lesson and point is the same just the situation changes. 

I can ignore her insane philisophy and just focus on the literature and if the book was half its length than it would be ok. This is ignoring her stupid worldview which is insane. 

So to summarize. The philisophy behind the book is pretty bad. The book is pretty bad as a book. I don't et the hype.  </TEXT>

Racist always voted gop, but Trump captures gop by appealing directly to racism and not indirectly to it like gop does. 

Your logic is flawed.

It isn't good or bad it is just Republicans like to put more extremist in power and they get fillibustered  more. 

It is based I guess if you want judges to rule based off religion belief, racial identity, or ideology and not law. That is the point of fillibuster to make it so a minority can block a extremist judge and they can compromise on a moderate judge they both can agree upon.

Bush was actually pretty normal. And the reason Republicans get more is they elect more extremist and activist judges who rule based off religion, ideology, or race as opposed to law.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not true. Bush had near historic Democrat support for much of his policies. They refused to go along with some terrible ideas like privatizing social security, which was good since the market crashed a few years later.

If you don't I recommend changing your username. I wrote it as a link so you could see it wasn't an insult I figured if I referenced it as your username it would not trigger you. 

The one here that seems hostile is you. I'm not sure why. You seem angry both at you thinking I am funny, a claim I never made, and angry at me at your choice of username.

In general if you state something stupid on the Internet, claim you have data, and don't show it be prepared to be mocked.

Looks like they were right in not trusting him as he has done nothing to help anyone except the very rich so far while putting racist in very high positions. The only justice here is that Trump is screwing over his own base the most. I mean almost everyone is getting screwed by trump, unless you are part of rich global elite, but blue collar white voters who voted for Trump have already lost the most.  </TEXT>

So even felons or children who can't vote have their vote given to whoever wins. If 51% of the population voted for one candidate and 49% for the other than EC will treat 100% as having voted for that candidate. It encourages people not to vote in nonswing  states.  </TEXT>

not everyone is as scummy as the gop. It is sad because the party did have some dignity in the past but it is just awful in almost every way. Corrupy, racist, hateful, greedy, ignorant, and undemocratic trying to stop actual democracy and voting. And they aren't even antigovernment. They love big government when it is to force you to follow their extremist religion positions, giving money to the rich, etc. They just don't want government helping normal people.  </TEXT>

Let's say California got its fair share of votes and a candidate wins California with 70% of the vote. EC would treat California as if 100% of the population voted for this candidate. 

It should just be popular vote.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wrong. His support of trump and putin show he doesnt care about transparency, individual rights, etc. Furthermore he is basically one of the shills he rallies against. 
He blindly pettles any conspiracy that benefits his fascist agenda. If challenged he drops it. He refuses to even consider events, like russiagate, since they hurt his agenda.


If he believed what he preached he would need to kill himself. So no there is no proof he believes what he says,  and his lawyer confirmed it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It began. Compared to the rest of Europe Russia was mostly far behind with a very small % of its workforce working in actual industry. 

If we are going to count the progress of industrialization as something positive than ussr  was a great success since stain vastly increased the % of workers I'm industry and output, even during times of war and chaos. Ussr is the biggest example of rapid industrialization after China in the 90s. 

As for Russian civil war, that was happening regardless of lenin. The elite in Russia controlled too much wealth and the vast majority had too little compared to them. The result is always revolution. That should serve as lesson to rich in america. It could be a fascist or a communist revolution but the elites will lose it all due to their greed.

<TEXT> He still drives the alright. His libertarian ideals are impossible to implement and what he tries to implement just results in inequality and poverty which fuels fascism and the altright. I agree he talks in a more sane matter now but what he believes is still crazy and results in fascism. He doesn't support fascism directly like Bannon sure but he supports it equally indirectly by promoting ideology that is insane. 

The end result of libertarianism is communism or fascism. They live in a randian  fantasy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Normally I don't agree.

Gop believes in no privacy, broadcasting personal issues, and judging people. They and their supports should be held to those standards and every detail of their life should be public and held against them always. 

This should apply to politicians  with this view and people who vote for them. 

Meanwhile people who believe in privacy and focusing on issues should not have this applied. 

I am sure they are such pillars of virtue that they will still come out looking better under close scrunity they give americans.  </TEXT>

The alright wants to create a situation that ultimately destroys them. That is how the extreme right always works. You can never best progress, maybe slow it down temporarily but the backlash will speed it up in the long run. That is human history. The only way for the right to win is to destroy humanity, barring that they will destroy themselves as progress crushes them like the instincts they are.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Putin is more of a threat directly, but the problem with Trump is that he is is inconsistent. He has no ideology or belief to him. he is intellectually lazy and just goes with whoever has his ear for the moment. He doesnt want to invade parts of Europe, and likely never will he could do something extremely impulsive without any thought to the consequences. Maybe even WWIII. He would rush right in, and it could come out of nowhere. 

He is not reliable. 

Putin is sneaky, but you know what he wants and is trying to do. He is playing a game but is aware their consequences. He has bad intentions for France but if you stand up you know he wont do anything impulsive.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> he is clearly demented. That is why he keeps bringing up his inauguration vs Obama. take a look at what happened with Ryancare, jared was skiing in Aspen and Trump had no clue what he was doing. He kept asking Ryan if the bill was good and Ryan told him it was great. Same with bannon, Bannon can control Trump.

Basically the last person who talks to trump can control him. That is why Ivanka his now his personal assistant, to limit access. 

Jared is our new President, and Trump is his proxy.  </TEXT>

For $3000 a month you will be fine, or $2000 for a single. My recommendation is live a little further out. This may come as a surprise to you but Georgetown has some good deals on rentals for over $2000. Or VA as others have said. Other options are Admo and dont discount union station. If you are willing to take 1-3 metro stops or a small bus ride you will have better options.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure they are, they want to make easy money. 

Sure the people taking these boot camps are paying lots of money for a very small leg up  but hey whatever. 

The fact remains employers don't care about boot camp. It is not a replacement for an actual degree, work experience, or an actual portfolio made on your own. If you are willing to do none of these things above than a boot camp is slightly better than nothing and may get someone an entry level job if they network really hard and are lucky. 

If I ran a school and wanted easy money I'd make one too. You are looking at this wrong. Boot camp is great if you are the one collecting the money. They aren't great if you are the one paying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A free online guide literally teaches it too for free. The only way to really learn is actually work in not go to a class, but you can *learn* about it for free. Your marketing for them is dishonest. From a career perspective employers are not impressed by these expensive boot camp certificates. 

What you want is a degree from a real school, actual work experience or a portfolio. Not some for profit certificate from a 6 week course. 

If you can't be bothered to learn on your own and build a portfolio than sure a boot camp will give you a small leg up for a very high price.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It isn't hyberbole. It is the truth. The altright  is basically honest gop  base. The gop heartland used to be the biggest supports of new deal type programs and welfare. They turned against it during civil rights when black people started to get it too. The gop exploited resentment of funds going to support non-whites to gut programs that poor white people mostly used. The language against welfare used by say Reagan *welfare queena, young bucks eating tbones  and driving cadillacs* was meant to tie government to supporting black people. The gop said these white people were winners and didn't need these programs but if they did need them they deserved it because they weren't lazy dark skinned people but honest god fearing Americans. They bought it up to spite black people, and other people they didn't like. 

The end result was the rich gutted them. In the same way the rich gutted black people in inner cities in the late 60s through the 80s the rich gutted lower and middle class white people in rural areas, and to a lesser extent suburbs.  The little wealth these people had trickled up to the elite. 

The altright realizes they have been duped. Make no mistake they never wanted to gut welfare for themselves just to nonwhites. They weren't honest about this in the past because it made them sound bad but that was the result of gop policy. However gop policy affected them too equally and now they are pissed. So now they are honest and want a redo. They want the welfare state of old but just for them, no non-christian and non-whites, and only Christian whites who hold their view should get benefits. That is always what they wanted they are just honest about it. 

Look at spencer. He supports say universal healthcare. Just in his white identity ethnonationalism way.  </TEXT>

The rich realized this and used the gop to cut benefits for all which poor racist whites supported until the cuts destroyed them too leaving them as badly off as the dark skinned people they hate.

<TEXT> That they want to make coal cost competitive. 

When it is only source of power it is competitive with regulation.  It just lowers the profits. Without regulation it still can't compete. 

You were mostly right but the coal of king coal is not to make coal cost competitive as it doesn't and can't compete. Rather before it dies they want to maximize their revenue.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im not seeing they make shit product. I am saying the climate and soil are not optimal for growing outdoors. It is so-so at best. There is nothing special about what is going on in Appalachia. It certainly cant compete with what is grown outdoors at west, the quality and the price is much lower. 

If it were fully legalized Appalachia would be at a disadvantage for outdoor growing. Indoor is different, I guess you could turn coal mines into giant indoor farms if you could heat them. 

but the soil is not great. I am from Appalachia too. The weed is shit there compared to the stuff out West. I love Appalachia but you are wrong. 

Cannabis is prevalent in many states and is the number one cash crop in many states.

https://www.drugscience.org/Archive/bcr2/cashcrops.html

Appalachian bud is not renowned, it wasnt thought of highly even in Appalachia. You can grow good stuff sure, but it isnt on the map. You are the first and only person I have heard making this claim. it sounds more like undeserved regional pride to me. Growers out west would laugh at your claims, and even these *mountain boys* dont make the claims you do.  

Drugs are very prevalent in Appalachia and have been ingrained in the culture for some time. They are often overpriced and low quality. I guess it is good because if these people had the same quality and lower price you could get in east/west urban corridors they would be dying in much greater numbers.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im sure they can grow it but I doubt it is best soil. 

If you look at optimal climates Appalachia doesnt meet the requirements

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_cultivation

It isnt awful, but it isnt that great. You want somewhere that is warm all year, but not too hot. Where this the right amount of water but not much. You wants nutrients in the soil, and Appalachia has bad soil, that is why it isnt a big farm area. 

Yes, you can grow it there and even get good results, but there is much better areas for growing. It is prevalent in Appalachia due to poverty and a drug culture, not because it has good soil.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not true. 

The owners know coal isnt competitive. Some people dont have an alternative yet as all they is coal plants. They know eventually it will be replaced. Environmental regulations lower their profits, which are still high. They want more profit. The coal miners will see very little benefit to decreased regulation maybe a small decrease in the decrease of coal jobs and a small increase in pay and benefits, but the owners of the capital will see tens of millions if not billions in profits before their company goes under.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> even without those barriers coal is dead. There are cheaper alternatives that pollute less. 

The only reason they have a job is legacy coal plants. Some areas havent built better newer power plants yet, and still need coal. The lack of demand for coal is not due to environmental regulation. The companies hate it because it makes them less profit and they want to squeeze all they can out of coal before it is fazed out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dont see why Trump is suddenly pretending to care. He was ok with Assad killing 200k civilians and supported the guy, and suddenly he kills 200 with Sarin and he cares? Yeah Sarin is horrible and I dont support Assad using it but isnt worse than all the past stuff he did. I certainly dont have faith in Trump to lead during a crisis like this. 

It is obviously a distract to cast doubt on Russiagate and all the money and support Putin gave him. Maybe Putin is in on this maybe it is a betrayal. Either way Russia will regret supporting Trump as he is unpredictable, cant be controlled or reasoned with, and is vindictive.

So either Putin is going to have diffuse the mess he made or we are going to have wwiii because Trump wont diffuse this, and he wont be restrained.  </TEXT>

Now Putin lost a little, but I doubt Trump is serious about doing anything else, although he is unpredictable, so I doubt Putin will lose much more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And it proved you wrong. Your earlier source doesnt mention Sarin, you pulled a new source to cover for the fact your earlier source proved you wrong. This new source is one person saying *we dont have proof but they might have Sarin*. If that person has proof they can share it, but the fact remains we know Assad has Sarin and has used it. Furthermore notice that the source is form 2013 and there is nothing else after that? That is because Del ponte was discredited and laughed out years ago. So we see you are desperately pulling sources and trying to spin them. Nobody takes Del ponte seriously not even Putin and Assad for propaganda purposes. 

so like I said earlier there is a very small, almost impossible chance it wasnt Assad, and there is an over 99% chance it was Assad, if you want to cling to the almost impossible scenario because it may be impossible in the same way it may be possible it was aliens you are just showing yourself to either be a propagandist or a person with faulty logic.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Russian syrian position is that they are always innocent and nothing is their fault, and the trail of bodies in their wake is everyone's fault but theirs. 

I guess those Russian ovservers should have paid better attention as it looks like Assad still has weapons, who would have thought they would be negligent. Just shocking. 

Your own source works against you here. IS has mustard gas not Sarin. Only person with Sarin in Syria is Assad. It is not eays to manufacture, store, or deploy and all cases of suspected use are by Assad. Both Assad and the rebels are known to have used chemical weapons, so so much for your *but its all gone* theory, but in the past it was chlorine and mustard gas. The Sarin gas is only known to have been used once before, by Assad. So end this false equivalency of *yes yes both side have used chemical weapons but ISIS used mustard gas publically and bragged about it so this use of Sarin gas must be IS despite the fact that they dont have the ability to make, store, or deploy it while Assad is known to have it and has the ability to store it and deploy it and uses chemical weapons much more frequently. Nevermind that while IS always takes credit for their infrequent chemical weapon use and Assad lies about his very frequent chemical weapon use, this time is exception.*

Everyone knows it is Assad except for a very few retards. If by some almost impossible chance it wasnt Assad he is still going to get the blame for it since evidence wise it could be nobody else. Dont worry though he isnt going to get in trouble, Trump doesnt care, so there is no need for this Russian style disinformation. You arent helping Russia or Assad out, you are just making the Russian propaganda apparatus look bad.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They have no history of having sarin  and if they had it they would use it and claim it. IS is not machalvian organization that uses deception. They do the worst they can with what they have and own up to it. Assad on the other hand... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your own doubts are not a defense. He isn't risking anything. Trump won't invade him or do anything and he knows it. He doesn't give a fuck  anymore. There is no need for you to repeat Russian propaganda as it isn't required to protect assad. Assad can use sarin gas everyday from now on. Russia can't do shit  either because they went all in supporting him. 

Good job putin.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He has majority in both house and Senate so he has no excuse for his failures. 

And he hasn't reached out to democrats or offered them anything. He basically goes *I'm going to pass a bunch of typical republican policies that hurt 99% of the people including your constituents. I will not bargain or compromise support me.* then he gets mad when he gets no support. It is like me saying *I'm going to rob all your stuff, beat you up, and rape your wife and daughters if you have any. In return I'll spit on you. Give me a chance. What you want wont? How dare you!* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had faith in Republicans for a long time but I cant anymore. They have had bad faith in America and any type of opposition to their extremism since Reagan. For about 3 decades we tried to reconcile with them but they refused everytime. Republicans cant even agree with each other or treat each other in good faith. 

It is depressing. There is no alternative. You can continue to hope the Republicans change but the fact is they wont. We need a party like the Republicans were before they went insane, but the party needs to collapse first before we can have a sane conservative party.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really, checks and balances isnt really a hallmark of the Republican party. They are for checks and balances only if they are not in power, where then they are for negating the whole agenda of the whole other party. When they are in power they wish US was a dictatorship. 

There is a big disparity in both parites in that Republicans have become very extremist and corrupt where they view anything they dont approve of as unamerican and will try to stop it even if it involves hurting America and democracy. 

Also most Republicans really dont think they are making the right decision for America. They usually are making decision to help themselves, although often voting Republican hurts them, or they are voting based off angry. Republican voters generally only want to help out other Republican voters, although the opposite happens. The Republicans themselves only want to help the rich.  </TEXT>

Why are you even on this sub. You are going to several threads I made expressing your butthurt that people dont like Trump. 

This dumb trumpet in the video thought America was her safe space now that Trump was president but the poor snowflake melted. Fuck her for being a bigot and stupid.  </TEXT>
