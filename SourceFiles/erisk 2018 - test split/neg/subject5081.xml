<TITLE> Is Obduction finally playable with a 970? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi guys

As per subject. I held out playing it as I wanted to enjoy the experieence. Anyone had luck playing it with a GTX970?

My other specs are: i5 6400k, 16GB ram, SSD.

I'm craving a good VR adventure game and Obduction seems right up my alley. If performance is still an issue, I might check out Wilson's Heart!

Thanks for your help!

<TEXT> Great write up. The community in this sub has changed greatly in the past year - now it feels like it's made of spoilt rich kids who don't understand a single thing about tech, but since they have the latest cool pricey toy, they feel entitled to everything.

Developing games takes time and money. From a technical standpoint, Batman VR is almost perfect. Incredible graphics with plenty of options, the best reverse kinematics I've seen in VR so far, super atmosphere, good story, superb voice acting. 

It's much better than seeing a movie in a theatre, and cheaper. I loved it and wish there was more like it. I'm actually tired of indie games - after the first *wave* of them (pun intended), devs aren't pushing indie games out that are creative (like usually happens normally with indie; I don't have the budget for fancy stuff so I offer you great ideas and gameplay), so a polished game/experience like Batman was a breath of fresh air.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  90% of VR games are small indie games

And I totally get it! However, both Unity and Unreal are implementing these options in their main engines. Source2 already has it built in iirc. Which means that's gonna be easier and easier.

Plus, what I think I want to say is, after you put out your game, if 970 is not the entry card, work towards it. Performance is the first thing in VR - it's what creates immersion!

<TEXT> Interplanetary communication will also resemble how Google etc ship massive amount of data when needed: with a courier service. I know seems stupid but if you need 200TB transferred, chances are physical mail with a copy is still faster (in most areas of the world).

So until we'll crack quantum communication, Netflix will probably send small, economic space-mail packages with ruggedized hard drives as soon as a new season is ready, so for example, shipping game of thrones season seven now would arrive just in time for the July premiere.

Also, I do believe we'll need a base on Luna or just orbiting Earth for launch of those small probes with data, so not too have to break orbit every time with the single package </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed - also, the amount of objects, polygons, reflections is very high throughout the game, and there was not a single hiccup. So if I had to bet, I'd say they are doing some juju with forward renderings etc.

<TEXT> I disagree, because it's one of the most hilarious, polished, performing VR games I've tried. And I'm here since wave1, so I know what I'm saying. Without the Rick and Morty IP that game would stand on its own, but all things considered (and including the amount of people I'll throw in this game) I think it's worth the money. 

Developing a game is hard, developing a VR game is harder and the market is very small. If you go to the movies with your SO and buy popcorns and a soda - here's your 30 bucks, for 1.5 hours, which are not even remotely comparable to a VR experience.

That's the issue I think - we keep comparing VR games to regular games, while it's a totally different new medium with which we happen to play games. </TEXT>

But because we aren't in the ideal world, go with the Vive, cause the tracking system is hands down the best. And before people say 'yeah but PSVR and Oculus are just as good ' - no, they aren't. And a slight issue in tracking kills immersion. And immersion is the key in VR.

I have my best friends scattered all over the world, and while VRChat (my fave) and AltSpace are great, they're stand-alone, meaning that to interact you have to install the app and create the account - the winner is the one that's gonna offer a seamless experience.

<TEXT> It is. My 970 is. The devs that don't use those cards as minimum entry aren't optimising.

Look at The Lab. Super sharp graphics and zero issues with my 970. 

Indie games aren't a good comparison term. Big studios know that the more they optimise, the more people will buy. Also, many indie devs don't have access to all the hardware to optimise. Maybe they have a 989 and that's all the optimisation they'll try. 

EVE:Valkyrie has one of the best graphics I've seen and it works perfectly on my 970. So again, optimisation is key. 

970/390 = basic experience with low graphics. That should still be the entry for VR. It's a dangerous game that indie devs are playing. 

Of course, now it's almost a year since VR is out, and surely more demanding titles are around the corner (FO4). We're bound to upgrade soonish if not for the prices of latest gen cards. I'm saving up for a 1080ti - just because I want the best experience possible. </TEXT>

Plus, if I do buy the xbox game, how do I get a key for the PC version? Or am I missing something?

<TEXT> The resolution of the GearVR is higher but that has nothing to do with my statement. Even the custom made screens for Oculus/Vive are 'cannibalisation' from smartphone tech. 

It's a fact, confirmed by Gabe Newell himself:

"The current headsets are essentially piggybacking off phone panels. Now people are looking at display technologies that aren't bastardized phone technologies. Once you start building something just for a VR headset you can go much faster than the phones.

"We're going to go from this weird position where VR right now is kind of low res, to being in a place where VR is higher res than just about anything else, with much higher refresh rates than you're going to see on either desktops or phones. You'll see the VR industry leapfrogging any other display technology. You'll start to see that happening in 2018 and 2019 when you'll be talking about incredibly high resolutions."

<TEXT> I made those calculations myself a while ago but didn't factor in VR specific tech advancements (foveated rendering, eye tracking, single pass stereo) that will lower the specs needed for high quality VR. So I believe with a 1080ti we'll be super fine for next gen  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually that's only partially true - the reason VR displays are still low-res (for VR) is mainly because VR as a market didn't exist and there were no investments in the field, so current gen uses cannibalised smartphone displays, which weren't made for that particular use. There's already superb VR-made displays we're gonna see soon.

Also, because there was no market/hardware, software is very straightforward thus requiring full rendering of the image @90 FPS. 

So now we have lowish res displays that require an insane amount of power.

Both Nvidia and AMD are working on software improvements to maximize VR performance; eye tracking with foveated rendering will also make the entry specs much lower.

My prediction is that a 980ti will be a good enough GPU to drive next gen headsets (retina-level) with the advanced technology in SW/HW.

That's why I bought the VIVE - not for HTC (although I've to say my opinion of the quality of their products improved drastically and 10/10 would buy HTC again) but for the lighthouse system.  </TEXT>

If you want a space fighting 'indie' with a small but fun campaign, then **House of the dying Sun** it's good for you.

I have both, I come back to EVE because it's a multiplayer experience and I want to be ready for when the government will need me to defend us from aliens (cit.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as I know they can't run fullscreen. Try to remove the drivers with DDU and reinstall them. 

Also, if you're experiencing this issue also with flat screen games, it's probably software related. Or maybe issues with the SLI sync. I would try with one single card first, and if the problem persists I'd try a format and reinstall from scratches  good luck!

<TEXT> True. But we're talking communication here. Of course, another race might experience time at a much slower pace than ourselves, thus allowing for "real-time" communication which would seem super slow to us. 

(side note: their internet must suck)

Without a reliable, fast-enough communication method, establishing basic comprehension is very, very, very hard.

<TEXT> Communication would be useless unless it happens on a FTL level. What good can you do if it takes you 20 years just to send and receive a message?

So unless communication on a quantum level is possible (there's been a small glimmer of hope for using quantum entanglement to that avail), any other communication mean is kinda useless. If it's just to say "hello", the easiest would be to send small transmitting probes to the closest star systems with habitable planets, and so on, expanding outwards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes and no. 

First, real manufacturing issues show themselves in the first few months of use. Anything happening after 6+ months is usually not really related to manufacturing. 

In Europe, as consumers we have two years warranty - but the second year only applies to the issues as stated above, which are very difficult to prove after such a long time. So it's kind of a moot point. 

What I did is: home content insurance for electronic devices. If anything I got on the list gets stolen on broken, I can have the full value back. 

It's great peace of mind for ten bucks per month.

<TEXT> From a price-to-performance perspective, people here are right, as of today RIFT wins. 

**But if I had to buy today, I'd buy a Vive again, for the same reason I bought it the first time: Lighthouse tracking.**

Today we discuss Lighthouse tracking 'only' for its accuracy, but by next year, when tracked accessories will be a thing, this system will show its superiority over Constellation. 

Also, I'll be able to 'mix and match'; lighthouses from HTC, controllers from Valve, HMD from LG, accessories from Logitech...

It's simply a superior ecosystem - and time will show it. </TEXT>

I was back in yesterday playing Arizona Sunshine Co-op with a friend and holy hell, that's the future of Co-Op gaming.

The Vive is in my habits. I cannot play First Person games anymore, they're ruined forever - VR or nothing. I still play third person games on a flat screen (Just finished TellTale Batman, going to start MadMax), and before my thumb accident I played a lot of EVE:Valkyrie and the casual Onward match.

But honestly, I have a busy life, so with games out / coming out like Obduction, Technolust, Anyland, AliceVR, ORgan Quarter, IronWolfVR, Robinson: The Journey, Dark Legion, Paranormal Activity, Budget Cuts, PULSAR: Lost Colony, Dead Secret, Eagle Flight, Soulkeepr VR...

Vive sold ~450k headsets. 

It's almost double. Would a more affordable system still more? Yes (see PSVR). But what Rubin said is corporate marketing - they were behind, they cut there price.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I'm sure that HTC will match the price somehow (maybe giving the new head strap and wireless included in the fall?), If I had to buy a VR headset now, I'd still buy the Vive, because of the lighthouse system. That's the single reason it convinced me one year ago. 

Also, only small studios will say yes to exclusives. In one year's time, when the total HMD out there (Oculus+PSVR+Vive) it's gonna hit ~5 million, We're gonna see bigger studios entering the game, better comfort and resolution, cheaper price, and cool accessories - and that's when the lighthouse system will really shine, and allow me to buy the HMD from, say, LG, controllers by Valve, gun by Logitech, wireless by TPcast etc - mix and match!

<TEXT> The light house system and the ability for third party pheripherals still position the Vive above other headsets. 

Oculus reduced the price of their HMD cause their sales weren't as good as expected. Good for the market as a whole, but an indicator that the Vive did better. 

Last but not least: Fallout 4.

<TEXT> While i agree with you, that everything is hackable, my question is: why would I want to go that length to do it? I am an engineer, did plenty of cyber security courses and was a 'hacker' back in my teens. 

It's not like in the movies or TV shows where an hack takes minutes. It takes a lot of planning, a lot of resources, a lot of time, and a lot of risk. 

Sure I can hack my friend's Android phone to mess with him. But hacking an Amazon Alexa/Google home/any unsecure smartphone would need to have a strong motive behind, cause the time/risk outweighs the potential benefit.

Pro tip: enable 2 factor authentication on everything, use different (long) passwords for different services, secure your WiFi and don't connect to networks you don't know, and unless you've something to hide / very valuable to steal, you'll be fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shot in the dark as I don't have any information, but since you're new to the family:

Avoid any possible reflection. If there's a mirror, picture frame, painting, window - anything reflective - this might cause tracking issues. 

In the SteamVR settings menu there's an option to see lighthouses coverage. This might help you understand if any of the lasers bounces on a reflective surface, thus messing with your tracking. 

I recently moved my play area and I immediately checked for 'weird tracking spots' - sure as hell there was one because one picture frame reflected the lasers and messed with hmd positioning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You'll be fine with standard settings for most games! I run a GTX970 and I can play everything.

You won't be able to crank stuff up to high or ultra, nor supersample (if not for very few basic games).

Supersampling = increasing the resolution of the image before scaling it down to the HMD resolution, which produces a sharper image effect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I agree with everything you've said, Gaben himself said "VR at current level is just good enough". 

But that's why we're here, because people that bought in gen 1 want to be at the forefront of technology! We're not discussing if VR is ready to be used by grandma - but if you're a gaming enthusiast, VR is more than ready. There's no flat screen game that compares to the shittiest VR experience.

So, while VR is not ready for mainstream adoption - is definitely ready to transport you to another reality! :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I bought the Vive in wave 1, so it's almost a year I've had it, and I don't regret any second of it. 

Eye tracking and full body tracking will be here, for sure, but not earlier than 2018. If you want to wait another year without VR, your call, but I'm sure it's not "worth the wait", because the experience won't be improved *that* massively until we have gen 2.0, which probably will be late 2018. 

So yeah, I think that if you have the budget for it, waiting is just wasted time :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> We need your computer specs to help you my friend. 

Edit: just saw your specs. Ok, nothing wrong with them apparently. What OS are you running? 

Usual troubleshooting: 
- make sure you have no malware/viruses 
- make sure you clean uninstall/install the graphics drivers, there's a program for that but I don't remember there name (maybe DDU)
- make sure your system settings relative to power are set for performance 
- try changing the USB port you use for your Vive
- try disabling camera/lowering camera refresh rate 

If all fails, if you have a friend with a good rig, is test the Vive with his computer just to rule out Vive issues. If it works, clean install of the OS and you should be good to go. </TEXT>

Pirating a game is never a good idea, especially indie games, because you're directly hurting small developers.

So yeah, 1080ti is for me! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Fact 1**, VR Games are ~~largely~~ financially ~~unviable~~ challenging if you plan to make a AAA game because there's no market to support it yet. Indie games are doing ok, some of them are even doing very well.

**Fact 2**, Oculus is throwing money at ~~ financially unviable games~~ games that were for the most part already in development and/or sweeping up finished games from a free market (KingSpray etc), not really to push the market but to sway consumers to them.

Now, while I don't like the practice, I do understand that for some devs this might mean see their game released or not. I do not blame those devs, in their position I would have done the same. 

**Fact 3** is the only one I agree with, however, it ties to the fact that WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY DEVELOPERS EXIST **SOLELY** THANKS TO OCULUS. So it's kind of a moot point.


Regarding "pushing VR further". I can't see it happening from Oculus, sorry, so you don't have to reply, because you won't convince me :) (unless you show me statistics where 70 out of 100 developers got into VR just thanks to Oculus). 

Oculus started VR, that's for sure, with DK1 and DK2. I don't even blame Carmac / Luckey for the whole Zenimax shenanigans. I blame the FB acquisition. Valve was working with Oculus for the first prototype. They showed Oculus their Roomscale technology, and had no plan to go to other manufacturers. Then FB money came in, and Valve got no reply from Oculus anymore, so they decided to find another partner, and HTC came into play. 

In an ideal world, we would have an Oculus Rift with Lighthouse tracking, if FB shady big corporation practices didn't come into play. But maybe that's for the best, as competition is what drives any market.

So I guess we'll have to agree to disagree here! The last line is, we both use VR and it's awesome, and it's only gonna get better! :)

<TEXT> I never said there's money to be made, and I know that the market is small, and I never said that funding VR games is bad. What I am questioning is the statement that "Oculus is pushing VR further". 

I don't want to drag this further. Oculus is pushing *their* agenda and *their* hardware. That much is clear and it's perfectly fine being a private company. But they're not pushing the VR market, their pushing their HMD.

Regarding the fact that we have devs that got into VR "Only because Oculus gave them money", again, I have no stats for this, and your logical conclusion does not provide any tangible data - it's your own conclusion,but it's not backed up by any official statistic. 

So I'm saying that the statement "Developers got into VR only because Oculus gave them money" is false until proven otherwise with tangible data.

EDIT: a line. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm seriously asking, hope not to come across as snarky: do you know for sure? Are you or do you know or can you point me to a developer who said, "If I didn't have Oculus money I would not have gotten into VR"?

Also, is there a statistic about this? Like, of 100 developers for VR games, 20 entered the game thanks to Oculus money or they would have never considered the gig?

I don't have such statistics, and that's why I think the statement is up for debate! So if you do have sources and numbers, I'll be happy to retract from my position :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> If we talk strictly money, Valve has more money than Oculus because Valve has actual cash flow from Steam. Oculus "only" has money because they have Facebook behind.

Honestly, it's kind of a sterile discussion that's been around for a while. Maybe I'm a pessimist and I choose to see the glass half empty when it comes down to funding for your own platform, while you see it as half full because of devs getting into VR (which I don't know, because I don't have any data to back up that claim). 

Still, I won't support Oculus because their business practices are shady and their communication style is misleading. That is a fact that's not up for discussion I think. </TEXT>

I know exclusivity is six months, which is the only reason why I'm ok with it and understand it - I give you money, you release on my platform first. Again, I'm not judging the giving money per se, more the statement "is pushing VR forward" because not really. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not saying funding is bad per se. Valve is giving developers loans to finish their games and push them out for **all the platforms**, not only one.

That's the bad part. Oculus is pushing their hardware, not the VR industry. They have the least market share, so if they really wanted to push VR, they'd fund games that run on PSVR or at least SteamVR. 

I think we have to thank Luckey for the vision that brought the kickstarter up and the spotlight back to this incredible tech - but it's a very sad story after the Facebook acquisition.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man I understand your feelings, but I urge you to be patient (pun intended!). AAA games take time, and VR has been in the wild only for less than a year. The user-base was ridicoulously small (and to some extent, still is) but now we have ~1Mil PSVR, half this number of Vives, and half this number of Oculus. 

By the end of 2017 we're gonna have the first AAA games where you'll be able to sink 50+ hours in. Hang in there buddy, that's first gen, we knew it would have been a walk in the desert (content-wise) with some great oasis around.

Also, Oculus might be funding a lot of games, but not really pushing VR further, because their business practices are shady. A company that wants to push a tech forward adopts open standards. Oculus wants to sell their HMD because in the end they're Facebook, and they want to have as many info on people as possible. To end this, Oculus games are not AAA - they're "indie" with a bit more of polish, which might be appealing in those first months, but trust me, in the long run, you'll forget all about it.

I don't know how many first-gen tech you ever had tried in your life - the pain is real waiting for content/upgrades, but VR has already a great head start compared to other first gen techs I've seen in my life, so we can't really complain :) we knew what we were getting into when we bought a Vive, right?

<TEXT> I've watched your videos and I like the idea of yours, where everything will be breachable. Again, yours is gonna be different from both Onward and Pavlov, and while comparisons will be made of course, it won't be a direct "competitor" of one or the other. 

I understand excitement, VR has been unreal so far, but imho the attitude of "X is better than Y, full stop" is detrimental to the enjoyment/growth of the community.

To each its own :)

<TEXT> They're two different games. 

We got it, Pavlov  is fast paced and more arcadey while Onward is more slow paced and you need to actually spend a lot of time in it to learn how to be good.

There's space for both, no need to bash one or the other. Sometimes this sub is filled with comparison trends (better Raw Data or Sairento? Better RecRoom paintball or Battledome? Better Battledome or Hover Junkers? And so on).

Let's just enjoy that we have choices, can we? :) it doesn't have to be a battle of titles!

Bonus info: for people who don't know, Pavlov was a Russian physiologist known primarily for his work in classical conditioning. The famous 'Pavlovian reflex'.

EDIT: grammar.

EDIT2: Maybe I should say, stop saying one is better than the other.

<TEXT> I think that, while Joystick vs. Trackpad is currently a matter of preference, time will prove the trackpad superior, for the fine-tuning it provides and customisation options. 

The current Touch controllers are very good ergonomically speaking, but you can see they're Gen 1 (they needed to port the consumers from a known  device - gamepad - to a totally new one). 

I'm sure Touch Gen2 it's gonna have trackpads, as Vive Wand Gen2 is gonna have open/close hand sensor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The more I think about it, the more I believe AR is gonna be very detrimental if used in everyday situations. The sense of being present, which is already altered so much by constant notifications from your smartphone, social networks etc is gonna fade even more. we're gonna be ever-connected, tied to a digital now which is different from the real now. We'll be with friends in a place, but we'll be looking at notifications from "friends" from another place. 

I had a smartwatch and sold it after ~1 year - this tether to my smartphone was more detrimental than useful.

On the other hand, AR for specialistic jobs is gonna be awesome - surgeons, mechanics, engineers, being able to cross-reference information directly in their field of view, amazing!

Even so, there's no reason to complain. You bought your Fallout, you got what you paid for. No taking advantage of. 

To me, it would be like complain if I owned a PS4 game and had to pay full price for the Xbox version.

<TEXT> Yup! Honestly, if I were a dev, I would smooth out the game dynamics as much as possible, create a basic story-line (2-4 hours of gameplay) and maybe a "wave mode", and release it for any price between 19.99 and 29.99. 

No Early Access, just super-smooth, with the promise of a free co-op multiplayer DLC if the game sells well enough.

At this point, you can then expand the storyline with paid DLCs, and bring it to a 15-hour-story game with multiplayer, co-op etc for a total of 50/60 bucks, which honestly is super honest.

I would love to hear what are some Devs thoughts on my plan.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> VR port =/= VR Game.

RE7 is the only VR game listed here. Alien Isolation, FO4 in VR were gimmicks. That's why Bethesda is taking time to re-build FO4 for VR. VR is not just stereoscopic view, it's the whole rommscale/controller/mechanics combo. You need to rework a lot of your game to make it work in VR. I'm actually impressed that FO4 was announced for VR, it shows that the medium is here to stay.

If Bethesda released it as a new game for $60, they'd insta-sell to 90% of the Vive population which is ~420k people. This equals to 22 Million dollars roughly. 

If they go the rout "you need original game + 30$ DLC add on" they'd still make 11 Million dollars + new sales of an "old" game. 

That's good money, so this will show other AAA studios that VR is already a sustainable market for small hits. But it takes time. 

2017 is gonna be a good year; 2018 VR is gonna become "mature" for a more widespread adoption. 

2020, we'll have OASIS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the complexity in Onward is the strategy part. Newbies just go in and start running and shooting and they get killed in less than 60 seconds. 

It takes a bit to understand that every movement has to be calculated or you'll die. Luckily the community is great so if someone really wants to learn, they just need to tell they're new and people will take care of it. 

On a side note, there's some usual players with a rifle stock that are very good at running around and killing everyone before getting killed. They're like the commandos. I am truly amazed by their aim and ability to spot me from the other side of the map.

Of course this gen will never have the resolution quality of even a 1080 monitor. But honestly, I believe that the sense of immersion makes up for it. AAA games will just add polish (can't wait for Fallout).

<TEXT> I've racked up 100 hours in Elite:Dangerous (because I'm a space junkie and I have HOTAS and piloting your ship in VR is just AWESOME). 

Second close is Onward with 50 hours (it doesn't look much, but it's unreal). It's a MilSim (which I normally don't like) but playing like you're *there* changes those games completely.

I loved Arizona Sunshine, which puts you in a zombie apocalypse scenario, Vertigo, which feels like a Portal Game, and the Gallery:Call of the Starseed, with the adventure feeling. 

Yesterday I had a great night by doing the Quest for the Golden Trophy in RecRoom, which is a VR-sports game.

I liked Adr1ft and The Assembly for the story, House of the Dying sun for the space setting, The Solus Project because I explored an alien planet, Universe Sandbox because it's amazing being god in space, Vanishing Realms because it's the first RPG like game I've tried in VR.

In the 1900s, Henry Ford said that if he asked to his customers what did they want, they would have replied "faster horses". He built cars.

So basically, I'm pointing to you that in the cars subreddit no one is really complaining about something that you only see complaints about in the horses subreddit.

Who has it right? People that actually have and use the new technology, or the people that only see it from outside?

<TEXT> The GabeN comment that's running up top Reddit is backed by so many people that never tried VR but only read journalists articles and think VR = pukefest.

I know it's the internet, and everyone has an opinion based on no facts/experience, but it saddens me. 

I bought the VIVE in April 2016. It cost me a lot of money and when I slipped it on the first time, I was worried - worried it would be a gimmick.

My worry disappeared in three seconds, the time it took me to realise that I could move my hands in a virtual world. 

I've hosted countless demos for people of all ages. Not a single one got motion sickness. Everyone went out thinking that this was the future. They were mind-blown. 

Three of my friends were so blown-away that they bought their VIVE (or PSVR) in the immediate coming months. They love it. I had the best experience ver yesterday evening in RecRoom by playing the Quest for the golden Trophy.

And that's only the beginning! I can't imagine what's in store for us. GabeN knows that those first people are the early adopters, he knows VR can only get better from now on. 

But of course, click-bait journalism is king. IT's better to dismiss something as a fad than to stop and think about what impact can it have. In the beginning of 1900, journalism looked at technology with awe. Now everyone is an expert on nothing, and the outlook is always negative.

**Mark my words, VR is gonna be a revolution as big as the smartphones**.

(full disclosure: I actually got motion sickness from VR. Three times in total. The first time was in Minecraft VR - the acceleration while flying just caught me off guard. The second time was in Elite: Dangerous while riding my rover on a rocky planet and jumping from one dune to the other. The third time was in Adr1ft, floating in space)

<TEXT> It's not. 

Go to /r/oculus, /r/vive, /r/PSVR. The motion sickness is marginal and only happens either if something's wrong with the game, or with weird fast movements (i.e. riding a horse, flying etc).

The messenger should verify the data either with provable anecdotal proof or with wide-spread studies. If the messenger only spreads one video and talks without data/proof, then yes, I shoot the messenger.

<TEXT> This phrase out of context sounds bad. What he said in the interview is that embracing the inherent risk of a new technology without worrying about money loss it's what enables them to push for it just to advance it (without a real eye for profit now).

He also says that VR as it is right now it's "barely sufficient   very expensive" - things that are true and are there just to say Hey, don't judge this as the finished, final product - this is gen 1 and is the worst is ever gonna be.

Valve is definitely pro-VR :)

Oculus sold 240k headsets, Vive sold 420k, almost double. I understand PSVR is the leader from.a numbers perspective, but an easy fix to make the game work with Revive would basically improve your reachable user base by 200%!

Then they opened Tokyo, London, and Rome.

<TEXT> I guess you haven't been involved with early adoption of technological products. 

When the iPhone was launched, there was no App Store. Apple opened it to developers one year after the original iPhone came out. 

You needed to shell out an insane amount of money for a stock experience, limited to browsing (without flash!!) and watching YouTube videos. 

VR has been here for less than a year, and we already have plenty. OP was whining about the current state, and I was relating that current state is awesome for a gen1 product, and that in a short timeframe it will be better. Also, he said we need games, which is a narrow point of view - VR is much bigger than gaming alone! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tried both, and own a Vive. They're very different. 

AR is gonna be big for professional use. Think a mechanic fixing a car and having the engine specs superimposed, or a surgeon, or architects to check out existing spaces.

But VR has the ability to transport you to a different world, and that opens a lot of possibilities for gaming, virtual tourism, education etc.

I think we're gonna see both techs taking off, with AR more mainstream but VR more impactful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man, VR is in its infancy. What we need is **patience.**

We're already "spoilt" with the quantity (and for some, quality) of indie games. Onward is a game you can easily sink 100+ hours in, Elite:Dangerous 400+, plus all the others smaller games that can keep you entertained for 10+ hours.

Given the proper amount of time, we'll have more and more polished content - but I think we're pretty swell already:

**SOCIAL**

Things like RecRoom, AltSpace, VRChat are already incredible glimpse at the future of social VR - it's gonna be huge. I have friends all over the world, and being able to spend time with them in VR while chasing monsters or just walking in a forest is gonna be awesome.

**EDUCATION**

We've been able to witness the Moon Landing already. I was shrunk atom-size and passed through blood cells. Yesterday I walked in a virtual museum and I was looking at the Birth of Venus and was in awe at the incredible beauty of that painting. I can't imagine what's in stock for the future.

**VIRTUAL TOURISM**

I mean, look at Google Earth VR. That's already incredible. With time, we'll have LIDAR scans of Street View, we'll be able to walk on Mars (oh wait! We can already!) and visit anywhere. ANYWHERE.

**ART**

Tilt Brush and other million programs. They'll only get better with time. Being an artist right now is AWESOME. I think Leonardo DaVinci would spend 100% of his time in Tilt Brush.

**GAMES**
I threw some titles there already. But honestly, the best is yet to come. Arizona Sunshine was a great example of a polished indie game: a story arch, good mechanics, it kept me entertained for 6 hours more or less. I can't imagine what would be playing Fallout 4!

**STORYTELLING**

I think VR really shines here. Allumette, The Rose and I, Pearl, Colosse, Gnomes and Goblins. Telling a story in VR means living it. Just amazing. Wait until big studios get involved, and you'll need another headset for your SO!


*tl;dr: VR is in its infancy, but avalable content right now is already mindblowing. in a short timeframe (1 year) we'll be flooded with quality stuff and OASIS here we come.*

<TEXT> I like it. I know the community is a bit burned out by wave shooters, but this one is very very polished and fun. The lobby of the hotel with the concierge guy (who is the actor in the movie) gave me a very good presence feeling (we miss good 3d models of people in VR). Not a lot of content apparently, but yesterday night I've played for one hour and I did only the shooting range and mission one (there's three missions in total).

My only gripe is graphics - it has great graphics but Unreal engine is either blurry or shimmery for me. 

Plus, this game made me realise that for high-end polished games, my GPU will struggle (I have a 970 and have to play with Low settings, of course with reprojection on). 

Time to save up for a 1080ti when it's gonna be a thing! </TEXT>

The lighthouse system is what sold me on the Vive - it's simple yet effective with zero overhead.

<TEXT> Mahyna school clearly teaches us to avoid eating the flesh of other beings. 

Theravada says:
"I declare there are three circumstances in which meat can be eaten: when it is not seen or heard or suspected (that a living being has been purposely slaughtered for the eater)"

Not a single cow/chicken/pig would be slaughtered if no one was buying meat. They are purposefully slaughtered for consumption - your buying it sentences them to death. 

Of course, the interpretation serves the purpose to feel less guilty about it. But choosing to buy meat = knowing that the animal has been slaughtered for your consumption. 

I agree that everything is illusory - but in my passing on thus planet, I strive to inflict the least amount of suffering that is possible. I've eaten meat for a long time and would eat it again if circumstances would occur; but I think  we should be aware that buying meat in a supermarket equals creating suffering. That's no argument - we can argue on the interpretation not the facts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started early. Super Mario Bros (the original). You could not save, so you had to guard the console from sisters/mothers etc (it happened twice that my friend's mom turned off the console because we were taking a break. No breaks while gaming is now a rule).

So I can retrace some of my kinks as a gamer back then. Then I got a thing for RPGs deriving from the old adventure games (Zak McKracken, Monkey Island etc) which exploded into mature love with Final Fantasy VII but more importantly, with Xenogears. 

Multiplayer (local of course, what's this Internet you're talking about?) came with Jikkyou Winning Eleven 4 (Japanese only).

3D graphics struggled to live up to its beautiful promise for a while. Sure, we got Resident Evil, and Silent Hill, and Colony Wars: Vengeance - but the race to "best graphic in a videogame" started, and kinda got in the way of playability, longevity, and story.

So I stopped.

But then Witcher 3 came out, and boy oh boy. For the first time in years I felt I had to play a videogame until I knew all of its secrets. the Witcher 3 is what re-ignited my gaming passion. 

And then, I bought a HTC Vive, and again, the 8yo inside of me wondered at the marvel that were about to happen - VR is the future! Graphics are not there yet but it's like playing video games for the first time again. All is new, a virgin land to explore.

Thank you Sapkowski for the books, and CD Projekt RED for The Witcher 3.

Thank you Palmer Luckey for having re-ignited the light of VR, and Valve for the development of the VIVE.

What a time to be alive! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. 

Aside from the fact that buying meat in a supermarket perpetrates a suffering much bigger than the buying meat from a farmer during the times of the Buddha - The whole mass-production + horrible living conditions + forced pregnancy and yada yada yada - the fact that you don't "see" the animal being abused/killed doesn't shy away from the fact that this thing happens and you know it. 

We have to reduce the suffering in this world as much as we can. 

Understanding that means not killing an animal to eat its flesh unless your own existence depends on this.

You yourself say that "It is impossible to live in the world without some unintentional slaughter" and I agree wholeheartedly. It's impossible indeed. But buying meat is not unintentional, is directly tied to the killing and suffering of the animal. 

I'm not advocating becoming a vegetarian / vegan (well, I am) but mostly to be aware of the suffering that there is behind your steak/sausage/whatever, and try to reduce it until your actions are not involved in that cirlce of suffering anymore.

<TEXT> Yup I agree on the slow burner. What we need is price reduction as you say, and this will come naturally albeit slowly - but to drive adoption we need also content. Big AAA level games will justify the purchase - also, entry level GPU prices will drop as new GPUs will become more popular.

<TEXT> I'm not saying  it wouldn't be a blow. It would. But VR/AR are at the edge of becoming mature technologies. Apple is investing in it, Google is investing in it. We (gamers) have been at the bleeding edge of this tech because a gaming enthusiast (Palmer Luckey) decided that it was about time, and sparked interest in the gaming community, but VR/AR investments were already being made. Oculus has the great merit of having attracted the spotlight early on thus guaranteeing a bootstrap of the market. If you look at it, we're actually a bit early - premium content is not ready yet. No one thought it would be that early, but VR is here to stay!

Side note: I don't think Zenimax is gonna block anything. They'll take the money after the appeal and then sell whatever game they'll make. Money is in the content, that's why FaceBook wanted to be there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's early to talk about high-end competition. Oculus   Vive are the first real VR headsets, PSVR is an incredible early attempt at real consumer VR. There's no standard for anything yet, that's why we have the Kronos consortium. 

Competition will arise in late 2017, 2018 when there's gonna be plenty of manufacturers around. Headsets will be just like monitors, and the real important thing will be content/engine/tracking/accessories. 

Even if Vive / Oculus died (and I hope and think they won't! IT's too good already :)) this wouldn't mean the death of VR as a mean of communication/gaming/etc. It's kinda naive thinking that if Oculus died, there would be no VR Market anymore. </TEXT>

This would be an easy fix with the colored armband, but then MrGreen would be the insta-kill-guy in Downfall as you would see the green dot moving from the other side of the map :) there's a reason why tactical uniforms are made to hide you.

Names on the tablet would be great. But I think an iPhone-like device on an armband strap would do the trick better - you'd have immediate visibility of map, objective, and colored dots + names of your teammates. So I can just glance at it and know where my teammates are (if the visualized map is smaller, give me a colored arrow which points to the direction of the teammate). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your CPU is fine. Not the best, but fine. You "perceive" framerate loss but senses are deceitful.

Do this:

- Open SteamVR, Settings.

- Disable reprojection.

- Activate "Perf Heuristics" and "Notify in Headset".

once you do so, play at least one Unreal game and one Unity game, something that's been out for long enough, SS set to 1. 

You should have everything butter-smooth with no warnings of lost frames (maybe during loading screens, the only time that CPU might matter).

At this point, raise SS +0.1 for every game session - so one session at 1.1, one at 1.2 and so on - and check when, in the different engine, you'll start getting stuttering / missed frames notified in the headset. 

That's the most reliable method to see if you're keeping 90FPS steady.

If at any point (but loading) you'll get missed frames before reaching 1.4 SS, then there's definitely some issue. It might be software, it might be hardware. Hard to tell. 

So you'll have to do troubleshooting. Check temperatures of your rig, clean it from dust, and play again. If temps are stable and normal, before thinking your card is "broken", you'll need to rule out SW issues. So you'll need to remove all the crapware on your machine, possibly perform a clean install of the GPU drivers (did you try to use Display Driver Uninstaller before installing the new GPU?). If you can do a format and fresh install, I'd do it.

If after all that you still get missing frames, then yes, it might be a hardware issue. Either the CPU is failing completely (it happens and you don't notice) / bottlenecking (but it shouldn't), or the GPU has some issues. You can stress-test both of them with benchmarking software. 

After all that, if benchmarks are good and stable, I'd look into changing CPU. The one you're using should be fine as I've said, but still, if you want to upgrade go for a SkyLake so you can use DDR4 RAM. </TEXT>

Also, my wiring was correct as I've said for 3/4 of the switches. The only light group giving me trouble is what I tagged in my picture as 1,2,3,4. That was wired weirdly and I left it out since I don't use that lights anyway.

<TEXT> The way I did it was to buy a Broadlink RM2Pro bridge - it's basically a IR/RF remote. The bridge works in the 433Mhz range for RF and can learn commands. 

Broadlink also sells RF WAll switches (the TP2) that you can install (so you basically replace the old switch with this one). The Broadlink App is very easy to use/pair.

Once you have this set up, you can turn your lights on/off by using the App or the phisical TP2 switch.

At this point, you need to teach homeassistant which ones are the codes to send the Broadlink to turn on/off the lights. There's plenty of methods around but the one I've used is, in my opinion, the simplest one: 

I bought a universal learning remote control for Garage Doors (433Mhz). I would put the remote in learning mode, and send the command to turn on the lights. The remote will have learned the command, so I can repeat the procedure for off and for every swithc.

At this point, I put the Broadlink in learning mode through Hass, and send the codes using the remote. 

I managed to automate the whole switches with this method :) unfortunately, the TP2 wall switches do not have state detection. That's the only downside! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've seen your reply but there's still no sources. So I did a bit of digging myself.

http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/whats-the-deadliest-power-source

Interesting read. the tl;dr is that Nuclear is on par with renewable if we take into account only direct deaths. 

However, disasters like Fukushima or worse Chernobyl (crops in Ukraina are contaminated for generations, and genetic mutations in the population persist today. [The World Health Organization estimated that 4,000 people may eventually die from that fallout](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2005/pr38/en/)) should have taught us that Nuclear is a great source but deeply flawed - from mining Uranium to disposing wastes passing through the unlikely but incredibly harmful meltdown. 

Renewable is the future, up until we build a Dyson Sphere.

We know that recognition alone is a nice thing for authors, but we understand the value of literature and wanted to go full in, and that's why our contest has a monetary prize even if our magazine is currently self-funded. 

(We hope in the future to pay for every piece we'll publish, but we're not at that stage yet)

I'll use the post to say that we're also looking for a social media expert to join our team -  our inaugural Issue 0 has featured works from prominent indie poets/authors and a superb Italian Painter, granting us to be listed on NewPages, so there's a good start to work with.

Since the Reddit account is still new, you can reply to me directly.

Can't wait to read your work! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> - spotlight for new books by indie authors (known or unknown) once they have reached 10 positive reviews in Amazon/Goodreads/wherever. Maybe sticky for one week? Dunno

- monthly (or whatever) AMA with more successful authors that hang out in reddit, to get insights (for writers) and ask questions (for readers)

- Recommend me a book: every X someone proposes a book by a famous author and the community adds indie books that might be similar (I.e. Slaughterhouse V by Kurt Vonnegut is the sample, and The Book of Ralph by Chris Steinsvold is the recommendation)

<TEXT> Thanks for your reply! 

I'll try to explain myself better. I have 4 light groups (spotlights) controlled by the 4 switches I've drawn (let's call them Group A). They are exactly as you've said - I've the same configuration (4 more switches) at the other side of the room which control the same lights (group B). So technically, if I turn one light off from Group A, then go on group B, I can turn on the light again.

I never use Group B to control the lights, only group A. Also, one of the Group B switch never worked (and once I've opened the Group A switches, I've discovered why: it wasn't wired to work :D).

I bought 2 smart switches, each of which can control 2 lights. They are the ones in the second picture. 

I've disconnected the main fuse, made sure there was no electricity left, and proceeded to install the new switches. Once I opened the 4 switches (which are all in the same panel) I was greeted with the unmarked wires. I proceeded to mark the wires with numbers so I could easily rewire them as they were originally, and to try and discover which one did what. 

Smart Switch 1, I've connected cable 10 in L, and cable 8 and 11 respectively in L1 and L2, and everything works as expected - I can turn on and off the lights, no issue.

Smart Switch 2, I've connected cable 7 in L, and cable 6 and 4 in L1 and L2. This is the switch that's giving me problems, as I can turn on and off L1 but not L2. Also, this was the only "weird" one, where in the COM I had two cables going in, instead of one.

Since my knowledge stops here, I left it as it is and as I've stated at the beginning of my post, I plan to call an electrician come Monday - but I'd love to understand where I'm getting it wrong! :)

Thanks again for any help you'd be able to provide!

<TEXT> I am in Ireland. In other countries I've lived in (Italy, Spain, US) the wires are colored coded.

I have a basic understanding of electrical wiring and would never attempt anything I am not capable of. I wrote this post to help me understand since it's Sunday and I cannot call an electrician in Sunday since it's not an emergency - everything works but one light. 

My attitude was/is not of 'giving it a go'. I can perform basic operations and did so with no issues, and asked for help when my knowledge wasn't enough. I didn't attempt anything out of my skill set. 

I thank you for your replies - unfortunately they haven't helped me, and while I understand the informations provided might not be enough, I just hoped to shed some light before calling a qualified electrician in.

<TEXT> Mmm in my (limited) experience the wires are always color-coded so you know which is which. 

Wires 11, 8, 6 and 4 go to 4 different lights.
Wires 10, 9 and 3 are the other wires for the 2-way system (which I'm deprecating).

<TEXT> Thanks for the reply and apologies for the wrong denomination. The drawing is exactly how I found the wires in the wall. I have a picture but it's the same as the drawing - all brown wires. I did number them myself so I can reconnect the old with when needed.

The item is for the EU Market so the voltage is adequate (250V). I couldn't find my exact model but I just wanted to share the type of item.

So I am basically using 2xSmart switches to control 4 lights (2 each switch). 

Thanks again for your reply . I understand there's not much I can do myself but I thought someone with experience might understand what's wrong here :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, I hope to get some help here before calling an electrician. 

I replaced my normal 2-way switches (4 of them) with some smart switches from Broadlink (TC2, [here](https://www.amazon.com/Broadlink-Wireless-Remote-Control-110v-150v/dp/B018K10JM4/ref=pd_sim_60_1?_encoding=UTF8 pd_rd_i=B018K10JM4 pd_rd_r=NXDQCK9NNC75GSQGCSF2 pd_rd_w=AwmZM pd_rd_wg=xdnb1 psc=1 refRID=NXDQCK9NNC75GSQGCSF2)) 

When I opened the plaque I was greeted by ALL BROWN wires. I am no electrician but I know the basics so I was kinda weirded out. I understood which wires were the load ones and proceeded to tag all the wires and install the new switches (2 x 2 gang).

[Here is a drawing of the original wiring + the new switches](http://imgur.com/a/427VF). For the new switches I used cables 5 and 10 as load for each switch, and cables 11,8,6 to power the lights (I don't need 2 way switching as I neve use the other ones).

Now for the weird things.

1. Lights 11, 8 and 6 power up with no problems, but light 3 doesn't with the current configuration.
2. Why the hell cables 1,2 were together?
3. if I try to use 1+2 as load (instead of 5), light 3 lights up, but no light 6.

I don't have equipment with me to manually check live current so I didn't do anything that I am not comfortable with. 

Any suggestion? I thought that 1+2 might use in a different neutral than 5, thus causing the whole shenanigans. If that was the case, can I "join" 1,2 and 5 as the same load in the same switch to power up everything?

Of course - I won't attempt anything unclear. I just wanted to understand before calling the electrician on Monday. 

Thanks to all of you! :)

<TEXT> Hey guys,

I feel almost stupid to ask, but I'm stuck! After the first boss (wow!) I go into the elevator again, kill a robot plus some squishy aliens and I get to grab the gun. I try going to the elevator on the left but a giant monster destroys the pathway, so I go right where the vent is, but I'm stuck! 

I've opened the gas tank, entered the vent, tried to shoot it... nothing. 

I understand I have to block the fan to shoot the button and open the door... I just don't know what to do.

Any help would be appreciated and HATS OFF to the dev, this is so far the most intense game I've played in VR together with Arizona Sunshine (which would have benefitted from locomotion options...just saying).

Thanks!

<TEXT> Curious to see how it will perform in real life scenarios. The transmitting frequency is 5Ghz like many modern routers, which means they're gonna have to deal with interferences. The Chinese one said it was using 60Ghz which delivers virtually no interference, super high speed, and horrible object penetration - which can be solved by putting the transmitter in the middle of your playspace's ceiling. 

We'll see! Exciting times ahead for sure :) </TEXT>

However, Ireland is a sought after destination AND it is already out of Schengen. We do have border control already from EU members, so for tourists, this won't change much in the Republic. If a tourist will want to come from/go into the UK, then they're gonna have another control. No biggie.

We've had this prior to Schengen in continental Europe. It happened already and it will happen again apparently.

The very sad thing is that people born in Northern Ireland will probably feel this more. It would be a good time for a referendum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes the tracking part is because, out of the box with Touch, 2 cameras won't give you the detailed tracking you need to lie down, snipe etc. With 3 cameras you should be set.

Regarding Fallout, there's some beef between Bethesda and Oculus, and they're developing for Vive systems only atm. I hope it will be available on both systems but it's not for sure:

https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/08/23/zenimax-oculus-rift-lawsuit-john-carmack-took-tech/

Regarding Constellation, I'm still not sold 100% on it as a tracking system. The fact that you need 3 cameras and RoomScale is still "Experimental" for Oculus smells of "Gosh, we didn't think this through". Does it work? Sure. Is it the best? Or is Vive's one? Time will tell!

<TEXT> 2 main reasons:

1) Controls with Touch are still finicky, the devs are figuring that out (minor annoyance)

2) tracking is not super-reliable if you are crouching/lying down to snipe </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only reply I'm gonna give you is a factual one since we disagree on the rest and arguing is useless :)

You have great freedom of movement Onward. You have to slide your thumb on the trackpad and you can slide left/right, move forward/backwards. If you double press the trackpad, you sprint. The only thing that's missing is vertical movement (climbing, going up ladders etc) but AFAIK the dev is addressing it.
I don't know about movement with Touch controllers (if it's the same or not).

It's at the moment one of the best FPS you can play in VR, and it's still in Early Access, so literally every aspect of it will be improved soon. It's not fair to compare it to big money titles, and it's not fair to say it sucks, because it doesn't, and its Steam reviews are proof of that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with your first part, but not much with the second part. Onward feels very realistic when playing it (the movement, reloading, shooting etc). A lot of people who have actually been in the military play it because it feels much more real - albeit unpolished - than a AAA FPS, and of course that is thanks to VR. 

It's also an Early Access game, which means the dev will definitely keep polishing it and making it better. I agree there's no alternative but Onward has been an incredibly brave bet with a new locomotion system which actually works (I was skeptical about it until I've tried it!) and a 4vs4 multiplayer experience which is filled with fun.

Of course, if someone comes out with a COD in VR there's not gonna be any comparison, but again, this is an early access game, and I won't judge it against something out of its league - Onward is, at the moment, the best VR multiplayer FPS we do have.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You don't move where you look. With the Vive (the only version I've tried) you move using the left hand trackpad. You can move one direction and shoot/look the other direction. 

Onward is a one-man-show by a young kid that dropped out of college and it's impressive. This guy single-handedly created a super indie game and made 500k ALONE.

<TEXT> In the end, it's really about personal preferences. The differences are almost negligible on a practical level so far. Yes roomscale blahblah but practically, it's really up to you. It has been said that Oculus is better with simulators (Elite Dangerous, Project Cars etc). I've never tried so would not know.

When I bought the Vive, it was the only real VR option - because of tracked motion controllers - but now it's great, we have a choice. 

So my suggestions are 2: 

1) Go where *your* preferred content is (or might be). You like multiplayer military FPS? Onward is incredible, and definitely better on the Vive (for now). Do you like racing games? Then maybe Oculus. Fallout 4? Then Vive. Timed exclusives? Oculus.

I know at the moment it's a hard call because content is not so defined yet, plus with the new Standard VR alliance, we might be lucky and get everything everywhere (almost).

2) Expandability of tech; we don't really know much about this so far. My only guess to future-proof (as much as possible) resides in the basic technologies, i.e. tracking. The Vive tracking system allows for tracked components (with very little CPU overhead for calculations), plus the upcoming Vive controllers look incredibly promising. 

Honestly, if I had to buy today, I'd buy Vive again.

<TEXT> I don't want to argue but that's wrong. The two techs used are very different and the Vive tracking has sub-millimiter precision while the Touch has pixel-level precision. With 3 cameras, the precision is very similar, but the Lighthouse system is a better one for tracking.

Oculus might be a better HMD but as a tracking system, the Lighthouse one is better.

On a side note: Valve is well-known for R D. Their first controllers are very good, and when the second gen will ship (2017?) it's gonna be incredible. I think we should just be all happy about our choices without thinking who's superior - we;re all enjoying an incredible technology, and only time will tell which standards will be adopted! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, what if you were trying to solve the problem of the entrophy - the thermal death of the universe is, at the moment, inevitable.

You're a very advanced civilisation but you still have to figure out how to keep the universe from becoming a place of death.

How do you do it? Simple. You create a self-sustaining simulation where by chaos theory multiple AIs will be born and will eventually have your own problem. They will all try to solve it for you. Time is relative, so for one of your simulations eons will have passed, but for you, only some hours.

Plus, this would go very well with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. </TEXT>

For an AAA Game that keeps me entertained: 2$ per hour (A game that I'll play and finish but won't miss i.e. Batman: Arkham knight)

For an AAA Game that I loved: 3$ per hour (in my case, Dishonored fits the bill)

For a superb Game (AAA or not) that makes me feel the feelz: 5$ per hour (think Firewatch, etc)

For any game that amazes me and stays with me forever: it doesn't matter the price (so far only FF7, Xenogears, The Witcher have managed to do so).


Now, VR is a different beast. I love Onward (40 hours in). I love Elite:Dangerous (60 hours in).

It's like buying things on Etsy. They're all overpriced because the people that make them aren't moving the same volumes as a mass-produced thing. You get to know you're supporting the indie market. 

Dante is a great example. He made one of the best VR games out there but he took a big bet on the locomotion - I was skeptical myself! But now look at us, all raving about Onward locomotion. 

**That's what I know I'm funding - the indie developer that can, eventually, become the next CD Projekt RED for VR.**

Also: finally a single-player game with a "story". Everything so far has been either a wave shooter or a multiplayer experience (I'm not complaining, I love Onward but The Gallery whet my appetite for more VR stories).

<TEXT> So, I'm hyped! 

However, there are a couple of suggestions that can make this game jump from "Oh here's another sandbox to try" to "THIS IS AMAZING". 

1) The game mechanics need to be hard not easy. Make it very hard for the players to sneak and make the Vive Mic always on so if you talk/breathe too heavily, enemies will acknowledge your presence etc. This will make the "stealth" experience so much more intense. 

2) It doesn't matter if it has 2000 levels/mazes, if there's no story to follow, after a while the game will become stale. That's not a multiplayer game, it's more a RPG game, let us follow a story with proper plot twists, voice acting, etc and we will care a bit less about how many levels/enemies/AI.

3) Right price point. A RPG sandbox with stealth mechanics priced 9.99 is already too much for me, but a fully fleshed 4-5 hours game (with future storylines as paid DLCs!) priced 29 euros it's instabuy.

I hope the devs are reading this. If you need help from the community (voice acting, story drafting etc) just try and ask - you'd be surprised! I am a writer myself and would love to help if needed :)

<TITLE> Plex Sensor refresh rate? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-06 11:47:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

I'm using the Plex Sensor to start a light automation to dim lights when playing a movie. It works very well but it's not immediate, my guess is due to the refresh rate of the sensor.

Can I make the refresh rate quicker? If so, what would be the terminology? Can't find it anywhere.

Thanks!

**EDIT: So apparently the refresh rate for the sensor is in the plex.py sensor file and it's set to 1 minute. I'll try to create a custom component and change the refresh rate to 5 seconds and see how it works! thanks to /u/fabfur for pointing me to the custom component and /u/iAmNotorious for the correct link** </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if trackpads or sticks are better in VR, but I disagreee with you - clicking a button in VR to perform an action is immersion-breaking. 

I actually like having to reach for a "physical" object behind my back to check on something i.e. a tablet to see where my teammates and my objective is (wink wink). I like manual reloading, as I would like to reach out my back to unsheate a sword.

But even with that - Fallout 4 has very high requirements. With that Intel Iris Graphics 550 you might get between 17-24 FPS at the lowest settings, and maybe 30 FPS with the Ultra-Low mod enabled.

If for you it's playable with those settings, go ahead!

<TEXT> This. I have my VR legs now and very rarely get sick - but for example I got sick in Google Earth while running too fast. Same happened in Vivecraft. 

Onward locomotion works very well for that kind of game, but definitely they need to implement some sort of blur/reduced FOV when running / sprinting. That only might make a big difference (oh and NO rotation movemebt with trackpad, only with head) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Celestron 31150 LCM 114 or 31051 130E? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-21 13:56:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

I've been dreaming of a telescope my whole life - even if the small one I got for Christmas when I was a kid was a scam of course ;)

Now I finally can gather a bit of higher budget for a scope (I know it's still very entry level, but I'd like to stay under 300 Euros) and have found those two on Amazon for a very reasonable price:

[Celestron 31150](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Celestron-31150-Computerised-Reflector-Telescope/dp/B0036GNNCC/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8 qid=1479732155 sr=8-9 keywords=newtonian+reflector+telescope)

[Celestron 31051](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Celestron-31051-Astromaster-Reflector-Telescope/dp/B0013Z42AK/ref=pd_vtph_421_bs_t_1?_encoding=UTF8 psc=1 refRID=N0GHEF2Y3JJCJQP98N3J)


Now, if I understand the basics correctly, the 31051 should be a better choice? 

I plan to use it mostly in a very lightly polluted suburban area with the occasional (~once per month) trip to a very dark sky location (I live in Ireland - clouds are the big issue here). I plan to observe the Moon, our SS (especially our jewel of the crown Saturn) and some deep sky objects (Andromeda Galaxy would be my dream).

Your advice is highly rated guys. If no one of those two is good enough, just call it out. I'll wait and save up a bit more.

Thanks for all your help,

Clear skies!

<TEXT> Elite Dangerous player here. I know, I'm asking you if I should jump ship to SC.

I loved Elite, and I played it with my VR headset so I *truly* enjoyed being there. But it does feel like space trucking. I mean it's a grindgrindgrind, get a bigger ship, grindgrindgrind. 

I miss a story (or even a loose storyline) where I can actually find ruins, explore them, find an object, join up with other players etc. 

I loved the vistas in Elite. I loved being inside my ship. I loved exploring and seeing black holes etc.

But now, after "only" 60 hours, I feel like it's an ocean wide, an inch deep....

...would Star Citizen be different?

Thanks to you all!

**EDIT: I'm not scared of Early Access / Alpha games, if I see a nice direction for development. I'll try the free weeks soon! Thanks to all of you for your insights.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right but I didn't consider other headsets on purpose. While the screen technology is very much out there, the tracking etc is not defined yet. 

Steam does support the VIVE and Oculus and my guess is that any third player is gonna have a hard time to claim a seat at the table. The only other VR worth considering I see is PSVR. 

Plus, even if we do have a third player better and compatible headset with flawless tracking (which I doubt it'll happen in the next year anyway cause R D should have started a while ago) we still lack the installed base of more powerful GPU to drive it. Oculus is lowering their requirements to attract more people. We don't need more/better headsets yet, what we need is more people with the existing ones - cause more people = more content = more people = more sales = more content = quicker innovation = 8k VR and 1180 both 'affordable' </TEXT>

<TEXT> There won't be a new Headset for at least 1.5 years.  Even so, a new headset will require absolute power (1080). Your Vive 1.0 will still be great even if. 

Even if the new controllers/base stations ship earlier, I'm sure you'll be able to upgrade if you want. 

Eventually, this tech is gonna become like smartphones - very quick update cycles. The good thing is I believe Valve is the right choice because you'll be able to add different things etc without having to re-buy everything. They're more interested in keeping you on Steam than anything else. 

So the choice is yours. Do you want to play now or wait one year plus? 

I had my Vive for 5 months now - I use it everyday. If a new HMD would come out tomorrow, I'd buy it, but those 5 months would have been totally worth it... a list of amazing things you can do now:

ONWARD 
The Solus Project
Elite: Dangerous
A Chair in a room 
Rec Room
Altspace VR events
Space Pirate Trainer
The Lab
Paddle Up

I mean, this'll keep you busy until next year my friend. 

Buy. It. Now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that piracy is not evil per se. I think it might be even good, if you read the whole article. 

The point of the article is, If you consume content without helping the person that created the content, well then this person won't be able to create more, because he won't be able to sustain his art. 

Your logic with "illegal breathers" is kind of a stretch - no one "created" oxygen nor can claim the ownership of it. But in the case of work of arts, then you're actually damaging the artist and the future creation of content.

<TITLE> [Literary, Short Story Collection] Of Life, Death, Aliens and Zombies - my first book is finally out :') </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-01 04:18:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

my short story collection "Of Life, Death, Aliens and Zombies" is finally available to purchase from all major retailers TODAY, for only 99 cents.
Reddit has been pivotal for my growth as a writer and I hope you'll like my stories. Despite the title, the stories draw heavily from the likes of Bukowski, Fante, and my favorite, Denis Johnson.

The reception from early reviewers has been great - since I'm very bad at self-promoting, I'm calling Reddit to help me, and I have a gift.
From all the people that will buy and leave an honest review for my book, I will draft 10 at random, and give away 1 signed paperback copy to each of them, for FREE, shipping included. Just mark it with the #Reddit hashtag so I'll know where you're coming from.

Click [here](https://dariowrites.com/) to know where to buy my book, and help me spread the word!

Thanks   namaste,

Dario </TEXT>

I like his style a lot and I love that he used only 3 colors, and kept plenty of space. 

Hope you like it as much as I do!

<TEXT> I was in the VR premiere of the show in AltSpace. The producers seemed really cool guys and they definitely loved VR before making the show (so it's not a 'jump on the early bandwagon' kinda thing). 

When asked 'Will it be on the Vive?' they chuckled uncomfortably and said that the Vive is their favorite VR platform but then answered with the stock 'we want it on any VR platform, at the moment tho it's not there' which smelled like Oculus sellout. 

Now, mine is a wild guess, but I wouldn't be surprised if Oculus gave them money to keep it exclusive.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the sales page (which is gonna be live the 1st of October):

The eight diverse short stories plus one novella that compose this collection are stories that some are afraid to tell - stories with a unique voice, shocking images, and dry prose - stories that might push you out of your comfort zone, spanning from tender and touching to shocking and horrific, without ever playing it safe.

Each one of them leaves a long-lasting impression - and will leave you wanting more.

Three of the stories were previously published in award-winning literary magazines, with five of them published for the first time.

The book also contains the first English translation of the best-selling novelette Impurit, which was Selected Work in February 2012, which was compared to works of authors such as Don DeLillo and Cormac McCarthy.

<TEXT> How long ago did you buy it? What was your objective when you bought/built your machine? If you spent 1200$ less than 2 years ago and you cannot run VR... well there's something wrong with your build then :)

VR is first-gen (technically, second gen. Let's say, first commercial gen). It's expensive like it was the first iPhone. It will get more affordable with time but no one said "VR is for the masses" yet.

<TEXT> Thing is, most people that are PC gamers would already have the rig to run VR headsets. 

Plus if you're working, saving up 900 euros isn't *that* hard in a long enough timeframe. Hell, it's the price of an iPhone. 

So PC VR isn't for everyone, but it's mind-blowing, nothing compared to mobile VR (for now). I don't think we'll see a gen2 before end of 2017 but I might be mistaken (and even then, the price will keep high for at least 2 gen more imho).

But, there's PSVR around the corner, so let's see how this plays out!

<TEXT> Because it's probably not related to graphics performance itself, but more probably to some CPU error - when I run Onwards my CPU goes to 70% and GPU to 60. So it should run perfectly. 

Running with higher privileges probably prioritized the process over something else, and it worked for me! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys

Just wanted to share what worked for me to fix the stutter/flashes in ONWARD. 

I've followed any other suggestion without luck. This morning I tried to run it a Admin and boom! Everything runs perfectly. 

Hope that will help you too guys! See you there!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

first, apologies to the people I was playing with 30 minutes ago. I was DarioKan and I sucked, but in my defense, the game stuttered *badly*.

I don't want to refund as I'm sure this game is gonna keep getting better, and the few moments I could play, it was a blast. 

Yes, every other game plays perfectly. Yes, I tried verifying the game cache and putting an exception in Windows Defender.

I guess it's a CPU-bound thing, but I've never had issues with it. 

My rig:

i5 6400
GTX970 (MSI Twin Frozr)
16GB DDR4 Ram

any clue/help would be appreciated. I'll try to play again tonight! See you there soldiers!

**EDIT: it seems a pretty common problem. Yesterday I tried again with no luck, so apologies again to my teammates. I won't refund it hoping for a fix. Dante, I'm trusting you! :)** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys,

**EDIT: Solved it. The configuration.yaml was duplicated for whatever reason. Now it works perfectly. Time to connect it to homebridge! Thank you all for the suggestions/ help!**

I'm new to Hass, I wanted to use it with my Orvibo plugs which are apparently supported. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to make it work. Hass doesn't see the plugs at all.

Here's my orvibo part of configuration.yaml:

# Orvibo
switch:
  - platform: orvibo
    discovery: false
    switches:
    - host: 192.168.1.74
      name: Lighthouse1
    - host: 192.168.1.75
      name: Lighthouse2

Here's a log error I receive when launching Homeassistant:

<DATE> 2016-09-11 17:50:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

back from holidays, I wanted to finally try Onward. First launch, everything goes smoothly, I go through the first setup, then before I join the lobby everything starts to stutter badly, then flashing screens. I quit the game, try to launch it again, but now the 80% of the time it doesn't start, and the other 20% it just stutters or blocks the image, resulting in the game being unplayable.

I reinstalled Onward, reinstalled GPU drivers, did the whole usual shenanigans. All other games run fine, zero issues. It's just Onward.

Anyone that had a similar experience and fixed it? If not, I'll try again tomorrow, but then I'll be forced to refund :(

Thanks for your help

**EDIT** I've verified the game cache and it started. I'll remove it from the antivirus check as well, today I cannot play but tomorrow I'll make sure to try! Thanks to all of you. See you there soldiers! </TEXT>

Love/Hate has some great artists, I personally just tried Paul O'Rourke for a shoulder tattoo (a Mahakala). I brought my own design, Paul modified it and we agreed on it. Thick, old school lines, it looks gorgeous. 
So from my experience, I liked them a lot. 

I have a friend who's done a full sleeve there, plus more tattoos and his only complain is that he never got to convince them to use color :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of very important theories have been created on gut feeling. 
I'm not advocating that, science need to be proven and I agree 100% but I am just saying that our knowledge of physics is restricted to the 4 dimensions as we know them. Operating on a quantum level might open possibilities that were dismissed. 

If I told someone in the Middle Ages that I was writing by touching a piece of glass, and that what I wrote was sent through the air and received by someone else miles and miles away, that would have laughed so hard!

So I guess what I'm saying is that we discovered a real-time event no matter the distance; it's acceptable speculation to say that maybe this is a step towards exploiting that. 

There's a very good book by a Chinese engineer Liu Cixin that advocates for real-time quantum communication - it is called The Three Body Problem. It is SciFi but Cixin has a scientific mind so his speculations are all very plausible. It's a great read! </TEXT>

I do think that for now (gen1), VR is *mostly* for gamers and early adopters (plus Gaming arcades, and Educational experiences). 

But niche was the iPhone, and exactly like the iPhone, when it came out most people scoffed at it. But some saw potential, and with the App store + consumerization of goods (=lower prices) then people started buying it, companies started copying it, and fast forward 10 years, we all have a smartphone.

When I tried a 3D tv, I knew immediately it was a fad. A gimmick.

When I tried the HTC Vive, I couldn't believe my own eyes. That was exactly what was promised years ago (I survived the VR of the 90s).

So they're two totally different pieces of tech. Mark my words: VR and AR will be ubiquitous in 3 years tops. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do have one. The HTC Vive. 
Immersion is already incredible. 

There's not a killer app yet for mainstream market, but I see the social aspect of it being a key factor for VR expansion (no wonder Oculus was bought by Facebook). If you try VR, make sure to try things like RecRoom where you interact live with other players and can play paintball etc. 

There's no nausea nor input lag with current tech. The nausea might arise if the locomotion implemented in-game is unnatural, because your brain sees movement but doesn't perceive inertia. Devs are working on different locomotion methods and tbh I've been nauseous only twice in months - and I'm an early adopter that tries every tech demo. 

You need to buy the headset which at the moment is 899USD, and you need a computer capable of running its screen @90 FPS - minimum requirement is a GTX970. People run their headsets with even lower spec cards but I would not recommend it. ATM there's no Mac that can run VR officially. But a custom-made PC to run VR will cost you ~800 bucks, so with 1800 bucks you can already try the future. 

It is more lightweight than you think, and comfortable to use for long sessions (sometimes I use it for 2-3 hours at a time and it's fine). 
Regarding children, there are no studies yet so I don't have an official answer. But I would simply use common sense now, which means, if your perception of reality is not yet formed, very little to no VR for you, and for short period of times. My kid is 13 and I have no issues with him playing longer sessions, but I wouldn't put a toddler in. 

The biggest obstacle right now is the content; since it's all brand new, there's very little available that's polished and more than a tech demo. But that's changing rapidly like the App Store in its infancy, and 2017 is gonna be the year of its boom. 

Regarding my 120 billion claim: http://www.digi-capital.com/news/2016/01/augmentedvirtual-reality-revenue-forecast-revised-to-hit-120-billion-by-2020/#.V76OTc9emaM

Hope that helps! I suggest you try a HTC vive ASAP. you'll be mind blown! :)

as per subject - I'm about to publish my anthology of collected works, titled "Of Life, Death, Aliens, and Zombies". This is the first step before publishing my novel "Dead Men Naked" (nope, not erotica :))

I would love to organise a pre-sales giveaway here on r/writing, as this community helped me a lot when I was finishing my novel one year ago. I was thinking of giving out 50 e-copies of the collection on a first come, first served basis. 

If I'm not breaking any rule, I'd like to do so. Calling the mods to understand if I can organise this, so I'll make a different post with more info, or not.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I played 25 hours in NMS and that's the only 2D game I've touched since I've owned the Vive! I really like the style and the setting and the vistas- that game would be amazing in VR! But hey 70 hours ain't that bad, it's less than 1 $ per hour of fun, so I'd say it's a good investment :)

Elite - that game is unbelievable in VR. If you've ever dreamt of piloting a Starship, just go for it. I bought a HOTAS and that's the way to play it. I'm 45 hours in and I just started to understand how I want to play it (there's no real story, but you can be anything - bounty hunter, smuggler, pirate, miner, hauler), so now I'm out of bounty hunting and I'm space trucking a bit to afford an exploration ship! :)

If you do start playing Elite, don't be discouraged, the learning curve is very steep, and remember that much of the lore is player-driven, so join a community like here on Reddit or on Discord so you'll have goals! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I pre-ordered it and paid 60 bucks, but not for the benefit of an improved ship - just becausae I thought what HelloGames was doing was pretty cool, and honestly, if I can choose who to give my money to, it will be the underdogs instead of the big corporations. 

Sean Murray (the head developer) put his heart and soul into this project. It's completely different from any other space sim - ED, Start Citizen, they're both "realistic", while NMS takes from the SciFi Pop culture - hence, the weird-ass aliens, the fancy colors etc. I was on the fence because I thought there was only one Space Sim in my life and that was Elite - but I know know I'll play NMS (played it on PS4, waiting for 6pm today for PC version :)).

Long story short: maybe it's not a 60 bucks AAA title on release, and if you can wait / don't want to spend that money, wait for a sale. 

But if you like exploration and SciFi Pop culture (Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy for example) then it's a definitely a game for you! :)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Dear /r/writing,

I've been part of this community for a long time, albeit I've been less active (just lurking) in the past year.

Together with 2 associates, we're bootstrapping a new Literary Magazine / Review called **Beautiful Losers**.

We want to publish the stories, poems, and non-fiction pieces that no one else wants because they're too daring, too odd, too beautiful to be part of the mainstream.

If you think you're a Beautiful Loser, we are looking for your submissions. 

You are free to submit up to 5 poems OR 2 pieces of fiction (max 5k words) OR 2 pieces of non-fiction (up to 5k words). If your work is outside of those guidelines but you think it deserves our attention, please do write a heads up to us first.

If your piece is gonna be selected for publication, it will probably go online through our Medium page: medium.com/beautiful-losers/

We publish on Medium every Wednesday, and will keep the best-submitted piece for our Quarterly Review (number #0 due before Christmas 2016).

If you want more info, please head on to www.beautifullosersmag.com

And if you want to try and submit, do it here: submissions@beautifullosersmag.com

*(Please check our submission guidelines first)*

We cannot offer compensation at the moment, but we hope to change that soon!

Looking forward to reading you soon!

- get a 'cheap' 970 and buy the Vive: 75 to 80 % of current VR titles will run ok

OR

- get a 980ti and the Vive and 99% of the titles will run mostly fine

OR

- get a 1070/1060 and the Vive, and 99% of the titles will run perfectly fine, plus you'll have a card that'll last you for your next PC.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not to be pedantic but that's the definition of sexism:

"prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex."

So according to that definition, the image is sexist - it sterotypes the different aspects of sex, highlighting different sexual behaviours according to stereotypes.

<TEXT> Yup that's why love Geralt, he doesn't deal in absolutes. 

In the book canons, Witchers are reluctant to slay dragons because usually they are not evil creatures - they become evil when men tries to kill them for their hide or treasures. Of course there's the stray Witcher that kills anything and anyone, but Geralt is adamant about himself - as he explains it to Three Jackdaws:

"But you cannot escape the conflict between Order and Chaos. In spite of your comparison, you're not a blacksmith. I saw how you work; you enter an underground tunnel and come out of it with a small, mangled basilisk. There is a difference, my pretty, between shoeing horses and killing basilisks. You've already indicated that you'll journey to the other side of the world to slay a certain monster if the pay is worth it. Let's say a fierce dragon destroys..."
"Bad example," interrupted Geralt.
"You see, the boundary becomes blurred already. I don't kill dragons, in spite of the fact they no doubt represent Chaos."
"Why is that?" Three Jackdaws licked his fingers, "But that's outrageous! Surely of all the monsters, the dragon is the most dangerous, vicious and cruel. Most terrible of all the reptiles. It attacks humans, spits fire and it even steals virgins! Haven't you heard enough stories about that? Is it possible that you, witcher, do not have a few dragon slayings in your list of accomplishments?"
"I do not hunt dragons," Geralt replied dryly, "Giant centipedes, yes. Dracolizards, dermopterans but not real dragons, greens, blacks or reds. Make no mistake about it."

This is not just Geralt's, IIRC it's what Uncle Vesemir taught him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks, but I don't trust reviews. Every 12 yo can write one. I do trust the team behind NMS tho. There were really no lies, it's clear they want to build the ability for players to meet each other, but it's hard to do (server sync etc). They didn't expect two players to meet so soon, and that's it.

It was never advertised as a multiplayer game, Sean Murray (the head of the studio) always said it's a solo journey. When pressed about Multiplayer (because now every kid and his mother wants multiplayer so they can redirect their frustration on human beings while being protected by a screen) Sean said that people will be able to meet, but it's very unlikely. 

It's crazy how this game went from child prodigy to shunned crap. It really shows how non-mature is the average gamer. 

Suggestion: I would avoid spoiling what happens at the end of a super-hyped game, or anything for that matter - you might take enjoyment away. </TEXT>

Armed with patience I re-started from a previous savegame, but as soon as I arrive in the big Hall, I sleep, save, and when I load, same thing happens.

I don't recall the name of the hall, I'm in the big cave, day 11, the one with the tall church-like construction in the middle.

Thanks for any help you'd give me!

<TEXT> I've had my Vive since end of May. 

It's my primary gaming screen - I play Elite:Dangerous, and there's no turning back. I'm also finishing the Solus Project, will finish A Chair in a Room, and play regularly The Thrill of the fight (best cardio ever) and Space Pirate Trainer.

I just started ADR1FT, and that's definitely a great title, very polished visuals, and good enough controls.

So what changed?

Novelty did wear off, meaning that I'm not mind-blown everytime I put the headset on. But I still open my mouth in awe when something really cool happens, and this is only thanks to VR. 

Plus, I'm not buying ALL the games now. I carefully pick the ones I want to experience. You'll see a lot of hate in this sub for short and expensive things like TheBlu or EverestVR, but that's for me what VR is for: to put you in places you would not normally be. So I enjoy those, and am waiting for bigger games.

Also, I haven't played any 2D games since. I had to finish BatmanAK, never got to finish Tomb Raider, and didn't play TW3: Blood and Wine (and the Witcher is my favorite game ever).

I pre-ordered No Man's Sky, and this is  the first 2D game I bought and that I'll play since I got the Vive.

All in all: I LOVE IT. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I tried it. 

AND I LOVE IT.

I like the delta for the movement (slower jog, slower movement, bigger jog, quicker movement etc). I hope this is implemented in every open world game/game where you need to travel around. It's amazing really and ZERO nausea. I feel it is a bit better than RIPmotion, although you do need to smooth out the start movement (there is a bit of stuttering).

I could play The Witcher VR, Fallout VR and that would be my favorite movement. One single problem I see: there's no lateral running. Think in a FPS where I want to move laterally (slide) while shooting. 

One way to change this is to have a button activated one. If I squeeze the left grip and jog, instead of running forward, I run sideway left.

If I squeeze the right grip and jog, I slide right.

If I squeeze both grips - well, here's a design choice. Do you decouple the movement i.e. the avatar keeps running in the last direction but I am free to move arms and head so I can, for example, move forward while shooting sideways? 

Or do I run backwards?

I think keeping the forward momentum BUT freeing the Camera view for shooting here and there is the way to go. 

I'd be glad to help you with more testing if needed. I do believe that's the future.

<TEXT> I know that phone support is horrible. When I moved house I lost UPC and was guaranteed by the landlord that my new house had Eircom Broadband 24MB. I come in, only 1.5 MB. Spoke on the phone with different people, no luck. 

Then I went on boards.ie and asked for help there. One Eircom rep picked up my case, did some tests and discovered that no one actually checked my broadband and just left it standard in the system (hence the 1.5MB, while my neighbour had 24 MB). 

In 2 hours he sorted me out with 24MB.

tl;dr - try writing on boards.ie when you have an issue instead of using the phone. You might get luckier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I pre-ordered it, didn't watch any leaked stream, stayed away from the subreddit which is full of toxic comments, and will enjoy my first hours the 12th of April. It's the first 2D game I'm eager to play since my Vive. 

I play E:D and even though I thought there's no space for 2 sims in my life, they're so different that I think I'll play both.

Like you, I feel that the game lends itself to VR in a big way. I hope they'll add it in. I don't have much gaming time, so between NMS, Elite and The Witcher: Blood and wine, I'm set for a while with games. That's to say, if they put VR support in the next 3/6 months, the game would still be a novelty to me.

But also, if VR support comes in 12 months, I'd probably want to go back in just to explore in VR. Let's be honest, the Solus Project is superb in VR, but kinda boring in 2D. So who knows what the future holds.

I'm surely gonna play it tho! :) </TEXT>

As pointed out, buy a good cargo/combat ship (fully fitted Cobra maybe?) head outside the bubble; look for boom economies, gain some rep, and you'll be making 3 million per hour like that staying at home mom that always pops up in ads on the internet ;)

<TEXT> AR / VR are definitely here to stay.

Pokemon Go aside, AR is where I see the biggest day-to-day potential, for Work application (doctors, surgeons, architects, engineers, mechanics... potential is limitless) and also personal use (turn-by-turn directions, entertainment etc).
AR is, indeed, augmenting our reality.

VR is gonna be more about "immersion". It's gonna be used for educational purposes (imagine witnessing the french revolution, the 1969 Rioting in the US etc etc), gaming, and high-def entertainment (you're not gonna just watch the sports / movies; you're gonna be in there).

What a time to be alive! </TEXT>

<TEXT> While that is true and roomscale doesn't usually add anything to a 'cockpit' game...

...it also depends on the cockpit. I play Elite:Dangerous and while the full game has to be played seated, it had a great presence moment for me the other day. 

I use VoiceAttack to impart some commands to my ship. I just bought a bigger ship and the cockpit is actually for 2 people - it has another seat right next to me. Also, it has space behind me, a glass pane on my left and right, and some other screens. 

It never occurred to me until I was bending my neck to explore my new ship - 'Wait...I can walk around!'

So here I was walking around the bridge of my new ship. And that alone was amazing. But then another thing struck me: I could tell the ship to leave docking and speed up, just with my voice. I felt in a fucking sci-fi movie, with my hands behind my back, watching the star close to me getting smaller, while my ship's AI jumped in hyperspace.

Mind you, I'm not scared of SpaceSims, Newtonian physics etc - I'm an Elite Pilot ;) it's just that all those recentering, seeing your controllers but decoupled from your hands...

I hope they'll fix it - I really really want to play this game and leave a stellar review! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you have a scientific mind and like to play with it yes. If not, it's still a great oh-my-god-I'm-floating-in-space first experience, but it loses interest over time quickly.

The desktop version has the ability to stand on moons and watch Saturn from there for example, while the VR version is a bit limited. Good thing is, you buy one and get the two, so you can "plan" your Solar system in 2D and then jump in VR to play with it. 

If you understand orbital velocity, apsis, periapsis, etc etc you'll like it. It's not a game; it's a sandbox for Science. </TEXT>

Regarding the gigantic screen (cinematic mode), this still requires to run the game at a lower resolution than normal (it has to be rendered twice) so I guess a lot of people will just stick to their hi-red monitors! 

Anyway, I'm being spoilt - let me play the game first and then complain about VR later ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree on keeping it simple, but knowing the players (especially the ladies) they'll drop interest if there's nothing "emotional" involved. That's why I was thinking a story.

Depending on which character they'll decide to play, I'd like to have them meet in a non-classic situation - not the classic tavern - but something like "you're all being captured by the royal guards" for whatever petty reason, have them interact with some NPC with kids, 
then have someone scoop in and kill everyone while leaving them alive, so they already know it's not safe out there. 

Panic situations bring people together, and then I can have them help one of the royal guard widows, for example, to do something out of guilt (I know my players) :) 

so from a task perspective, I'll keep it simple. I was just wondering if there's any entry-level pre-made adventure with a good solid background to use! But thanks for the suggestion :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you might have bought it too early, as you've noticed yourself. If you don't have a high from trying a brand new tech, and complain about early access games (which I totally understand, not passing judgement here) then I suggest you might try VR "ports" - games that were not made originally for VR but play nicely with it.

First would be Elite:Dangerous. If you remotely like space sims, then this one is a must with HOTAS. Holy hell, I've been dreaming of piloting my spaceship since I was a little kid.

If you like cars, you might try Assetto Corsa or Project cars.

And if you like exploration/mystery, you can try The Solus Project or A Chair in a Room (psych horror). 

I'm sure those ones will let you love your vive until more polished content is out :) </TEXT>

And yes. Please please please bring VR to No Man's Sky. We should ask /u/jrbuddha to use some of his love for the Minecraft port for NMS... so I can sink my time in that game forever!!!

<TEXT> Me too. I am ok to spend 60/70 euros on AAA 2D games if they deserve it (like The Witcher), so if you gave me same level of story and quality, I'd pay double. 

Regarding locomotion: I just hope that different locomotions are implemented for the same games. Just lock people out of cheating locomotion when in combat (teleportation would break it, as you could always teleport on the back of the monster).

Ive been thinking a lot about this with a friend, and since no one in real life is as fit as Geralt, devs just need to introduce bullet time combat. Give me a bar, make me combat, every hit/dodge fills the bar, when bar is full everything slows down but me. 

Then give me a 3rd person replay and let me enjoy my badassness.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-08-01 13:14:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ...and the marriage is still amazing :) 

I'm not compulsively buying every new release on Steam like early days, and am starting to play 2D games again (I'm looking at you, The Witcher:Blood and Wine). 

But, my headset is so much into my routine now; if I can choose between a VR game and a 2D game, I'd still play the VR one. 

I'm playing a lot of E:D, and will finish soon The Solus Project; still playing SPT for the fun, Thrill of the Fight for a bit of cardio (together with Longbow) and the odd game of Pool. 
I'll never finish A Chair in a Room, too scary for me apparently.

The only 2D game I'll be playing in the foreseeable future are The Witcher and No Man's Sky (albeit the latter can conflict with my ED playing, and NMS being 2D only... I hope I won't regret preordering).

I'm now patient enough to be waiting for the 1080ti and am ready for AAA VR games. It's amazing how quickly VR entered my gaming routine! 

One area of improvement: social interactions   virtual tourism. For as much as I like Altspace VR and RecRoom, I'd like to see more "quiet" environments to participate at events such as debates, TED Talks etc, and virtual visits to art exhibitions, museums, Time-traveling to crucial historical events (OASIS here we come). But that's my personal preference!

How's the VR honeymoon ended for you guys?

**EDIT: So many experiences! Please do keep sharing. I wanted to say that even if the honeymoon is over, I still love my Vive like day 1 - it's just a more mature relationship now :)**

I guessed it was easy. The heck it is. I don't even find those things. I enter with my SRV, destroy some turrets, even manage to collect some data (worth 700k, for me that's golden). 

Then, my SRV gets shot FROM THE UNDERGROUND. I cannot shoot those invisible turrets, but they can shoot me. 
I run to my ship, and try to fly over the outpost, but same thing apply - actually my shields go down very quickly, hull at 5%, I ran away. 

I tried this three times, same result. I don't even know how those Sentry Skimmers look like, how why turrets from underground can shoot me :(

Any help is appreciated!

<TEXT> Which part of "be yourself" didn't come through? 

Mine was a comment against the standardization of fake beauty, not about how you want to look like, nor was I saying that *everyone should look like the girl in the picture*. They should look *natural* like the girl in the picture.

There's definitely a correlation between how you want to look like and your cultural pressure. I say, resist the cultural pressure, because it's created to make you feel not-perfect.

I am happy with how I look, and if you were to tell me to look more like the guy in the picture, meaning what I mean = be natural, then I'd agree with you. I groom myself but no chance in hell I remove all my body hair like a newborn baby just because advertising says so.

If you're happy with who you are and how you look, then it's great. But don't follow unattainable beauty standards or you'll never be happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **First**, you can state your point without being rude. Life's hard as it is, there's no need to give out for those small things. :)

**Second**, the product (HTC Vive) is a commercially available one, albeit first-gen (and hence with little spread). It is perfectly supported by the two biggest, most widespread engines around (Unity and Unreal). Frontier uses their own engine (Cobra).

**Third**, by providing feedback to Frontier, and letting them know how many people are affected by the issue, /u/Geirulrf might help both the VR community and the developers to revise their priorities.

That's it! I think it's good to let Frontier know how many people are actually affected by this "issue". Even if a gen1 product, VR is amazing, and once you try E:D in VR that's all you want to do.

Fly safe! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can still find this kind of beauty. Especially in northern Europe (Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark) or if you like, latin countries (SouthAmerica, Spain, Italy). 

Unfortunately, the beauty standard for UK/US/Australian women has been artificially modified to follow impossible standards, set on purpose by corporations to sell more beauty products - because no one can actually look exactly like they said you should, you're doomed to buy useless stuff forever. 

So pre-teens already want new boobs, new nose, new face. In the end, natural beauty is replaced with fake-constructed one. Also, this kind of beauty (the fake one) also doesn't play well with ageing, forcing women to look 20-something forever.

sorry about the rant :)

<TEXT> Ma e' la vita che e' cosi. Non sto dicendo che deve essere cosi sempre, ma e' cosi - se vuoi qualcosa, lavori duro per ottenerla. Punto. 

Vuoi laurearti? non ho niente in contrario a stare a casa con i genitori, anzi. Pero' utilizza questo "privilegio" per laurearti in tempo. Non abusarne. E questo vale per qualsiasi cosa.

Vuoi andare via di casa? Trovati un lavoro e vai. Vuoi anche laurearti nel frattempo? Peccato, dovrai studiare molto e avrai poco tempo libero. Se sei davvero bravo, in 3 anni hai finito la prima laurea e puoi trovare un lavoro migliore. Sempre se studi qualcosa che ti porti ad un lavoro e non cose assurde che non servono a nulla - in quel caso, studia pure, il sapere e' importantissimo, ma non hai bisogno della laurea.

La mia vicina di casa e' una ragazza spagnola di 28 anni. Ha un figlio di un anno e mezzo, lavora full time, e la sera va anche alla scuola serale. Il suo compagno e' francese, e nessuno dei due ha la famiglia vicina per aiutarli. Come fanno? Si rimboccano le maniche. Una sera studia lei, l'altra sera va in palestra lui, si danno il cambio. Quando vogliono uscire assieme, chiedono di tenere il bambino agli amici (me incluso).

Basta con le scuse, se si vuole qualcosa, ci si rimbocca le maniche, si lavora duro. Se hai due braccia, due gambe, e mezza testa, puoi sostenerti da solo ed ottenre praticamente qualsiasi cosa.

Ora vivo in nord Europa. Ti assicuro che uno stipendio da cameriere in nord Europa  proporzionato stipendio/spese tanto quanto in Italia. I ventenni qui fanno cos. 

Inoltre, la vita  molto pi cara in nord Europa, quindi al massimo kudos to them. 

Il fatto che tu abbia dismesso il mio commento dicendo che  una 'cazzata' dimostra poco rispetto e arroganza.

<TEXT> Andare a vivere da soli, anche solo per un periodo, e' formativo. 

Lavorare e pagarsi bollette e affitto, se anche fosse solo per un anno, vale tantissimo nel percorso di maturazione di un individuo. 

Ovvio ci sono compromessi da fare, e la lezione e' proprio questa - imparare a fare compromessi. Non posso permettermi l'appartamento in centro? Vado a vivere con altra gente. Non mi piace vivere con altra gente? Vado a vivere piu lontano.

Ho poco tempo libero per divertirmi perche lavoro e studio? Tempra il carattere, cosi apprezzi il tempo libero ancora di piu. 

Io sono assolutamente per una vita piu "comunale", intesa nel senso di condivisione di spazi comuni come le famiglie di inizio 900. Ma ci sono tantissime sfumature ed esperienze che vanno esplorate prima di scegliere come vivere. 

Il mio puntare il dito contro i genitori che pagano l'universita fuori sede non e' relativo al fatto in se - era relativo al fatto che tale opzione fosse stata suggerita come "soluzione" ad una persona che non vive una situazione familiare facile. 

Non parliamo di ragazzini minorenni; se hai diciotto anni e vuoi andare via da casa, trovi un lavoro e vai via. Come fanno tutti in nord Europa. Non c'e' bisogno della sovvenzione di mamma' e papa'.

Is not blurry in an unreadable way, it is actually quite good and I have no problems, but it's a big difference from my 4k screen - and don't get me wrong, I totally understand the current gen VR limitations, and exactly because I know those limits I can say that with Elite:Dangerous we're not even close to pushing them :) this game could look *so* much better if optimised properly! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry about your problems. I'm a IT engineer and I know troubleshooting random problems can be painful. 

I think you should check if the system updated ANYTHING automatically yesterday. Windows updates, other 3rd party updates that could have screwed up. 

If you can, revert to a moment in time where everything worked and disable automatic updates. 

You've tried pretty much anything from a software perspective but a clean system install. Try this as a last resort to rule out software issues. 

If a clean install doesn't solve it, we're looking at hardware issues. 

If you have a friend with a capable machine, bring the VIVE to him and test it. If it works, you can rule out a faulty VIVE/lighthouses/cables (bring your cables!)

If the vive works at your friend's, then it's your computer. 

First culprits for me would be: cabling somewhere is failing, CPU is failing, PSU is failing, SSD is failing, RAM is failing, MB is failing. Not all at once :) but in this order usually. 

Troubleshooting Hardware is a pain. I hope you'll solve it with a clean install. 

Keep us posted! </TEXT>

They don't want to reveal things and I get why, but it's a full on AR headset which apparently can do VR as well (I don't know how good it will be tho).

The known things is that uses a technology that delivers light beams directly into your eyes. I'm very curious to see this when they'll deliver (which I'm sure they'll do, too much money invested). Don't expect it to be a consumer version tho. This might very well be the 10k headset that you get to try at fairs and is used only by super-specific pros. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys,

the title says it all, I wanted to use ANUBIS VA pack as it's free so I can try it, but I'm worried about key binds.

I use a Thrustmaster FX HOTAS and have custom-bound it. ANUBIS asks to change the .binds file. Does this mean I'll have to re-bind everything manually again? 

Is this true for every voice pack, or are there voice packs that will work without modyfing my button binds?

One question for those of you with an HTC Vive: do you use the standard ViveMic? 

And last question: do you need to bind a key to start VA in ED, or is it always listening?

Many thanks to all of you commanders, fly safe out there.

<TEXT> You're completely right. The issue with Lighthouse is that you need sensors on the tracked object, and power to send the signal to your computer. So any tracked object will need to have a battery and to be charged; of course we will see them, but in time. My guess is we'll first see a tracked Steam controller and a tracked keyboard. 

Constellation is easier to implement and I'm sure they'll 'copy' Sony and put out a tracked xbox controller out soon.

VR and cockpit games are a great marriage, it allows us to play fully fledged non-VR games in such a cool way. 

I love this. And I love the Solus Project, which wasn't made for VR but works perfectly. The issue we're having is not VR itself, is ~~lack~~ scarcity of polished content. This disappears as soon as you play a full game (Elite, etc etc). 

When we'll have the first AAA games built ground up for VR, poor my life.

<TEXT> I hate to be that guy but... no, we won't get 4k per eye commercial HMDs anytime soon (3/5 years?).

Foveated rendering + eye tracking will improve performance greatly, but still in the range of 30 to 40%. That's not enough to drive two 4k screens at 90FPS even with a 1080.

Maybe with a 1080SLI (one card per eye) that might be possible, which of course, reduces the possible market so much that you are looking at specific use cases, not at a consumer product.

Now, if of course someone will make a 4k per eye headset, and you have the money to buy 2x1080ti, you're still stuck with unoptimised software. But the little content you'll be able to enjoy in 4k will be awsome.

What you did, instead of adding to the conversation with sources, or trying to correct the facts in a constructive way, was just plain arguing and attacking. And shame it's on me for continuing the conversation.

Both panels are from Samsung. The Oculus CV1 panel is not branded for their own reasons but it's same tech as the Vive one. The difference in size (stated even by iFixit in the range of less than 1.8mm) is not due only to form factors. 

So you could have just told me "Hey, there's actually a typo in your write-up, the ppi is slightly different, here are the sources! And thanks for taking the time of writing all up!". 

As a LPT, instead of criticising people, try to work together with them to improve the world around you - even if the improvement is really small. It's how you can actually make an impact - by helping people, not by cuddling in your own sense of entitlement.

Same as the second - in the written article it states same panels, only in the recap column it gives one AMOLED and another one OLED. 

Plus honestly I took the time to write a comprehensive recap, checking sources and facts, and here I am arguing with strangers on the internet because X is better than Y. The perception of things is relative even for the same facts. Even if FOV by degrees is the same the lenses make the Vive perceived FOV bigger in my opinion. But that's not how you write things, not by opinions. 

I have a Vive and am happy with it, I love it. I wrote this because I was tired of reading 'Oculus is crap lolz', and because I wanted to explain why PSVR's quality might be good even tho on paper it starts with some GPU power handicaps. 

But no, people don't want analysis, they want to give in their confirmation bias. So be it.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-07-21 15:17:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

having noticed a lot of misinformation on the current HMDs available, I decided to clarify and collect all the points that make each HMD different from one another.

*Consider that the final quality of a VR experience is given by the sum of the parts. Having simply a better resolution or better FOV doesn't necessarily means better VR*

Let's get this started!

**SCREEN TECH SPECS**

*HTC Vive*: Samsung OLED 21601200 (10801200 per eye), ~447ppi, 110degrees FOV (diagonal measurement of screen) , 90Hz 

*Oculus Rift*: Not-branded, Samsung manufactured OLED 21601200 (10801200 per eye), ~456ppi, 110degrees FOV (diagonal measurement of screen), 90Hz

*PSVR*: OLED 19201080 (9601080 per eye), ~386ppi, 100degrees, 120Hz (60Hz reprojected)

*Gear VR* (with a Samsung Galaxy S7): AMOLED 25601440 (12801440 per eye), ~540ppi, 90degrees, 60Hz


Let's analyse the screen raw specs. While the GEAR VR with a Samsung Galaxy S7 has a higher pixel density and higher resolution, the final result is of lower quality then of any other headset, partly because of a smaller FOV, and mainly because the mobile GPU doesn't really render at the given resolution, but upscales two square low-res images. The resulting image is of lesser quality then any of the images displayed on the VIVE/Rift/PSVR.

Also, HTC Vive / Oculus Rift / GearVR all use RGBG PenTile screens, while PSVR uses FullRGB screens. It has been proved that RGBG PenTile screens have a more noticeable Screen Door Effect, which is less noticeable on a fullRGB screen - this could be part of the explanation of why people that tried PSVR said that screen quality was very high.


**LENSES**

 **GEAR VR** uses standard +30 DPT lenses, which are the lowest quality ones in this list. **HTC Vive** uses custom-made fresnel lenses. Fresnel lenses are lenses that are cut in a certain way to reduce weight - this is what makes the "rings" effect when you look at a bright object against a dark background in your Vive.

The **Oculus Rift** uses custom hybrid fresnel/normal lenses, to cut weight but reduce the ring effect. While this custom lens reduces the ring effect, it augments the God Ray effect and a general blurriness of the edges when looking at bright objects against a dark background. 

**PSVR** is the most interesting of all, as Sony has a great history of building optics. They use an advanced multi-element optics (from what we've seen so far) which highly reduces any God Ray / blurriness. We'll have to wait until it's out, but it might be the HMD with the best optics around.

--

**GPU Power**

Of course, this doesn't depend on the HMD but on the GPU you're using. This immediately cuts out the GEARVR from the competition, as the Samsung Galaxy S7 mobile GPU has 36.8 GFLOPS of graphic power - which is 0.0348 TFLOPS (TeraFLOPS). A comparison of raw computational power:

**GTX 970** Stock is 3.9 TFLOPS

**GTX 1080** Stock is 9 TFLOPS

**PS4** is 1.84 TFLOPS.

Now, I've been wondering how the hell will Sony run the HMD with "only" 1.84 TFLOPS. The answer lies in the lower Refresh rate, lower FOV, and a rendering technique which Sony patented in 2014 called "VARYING EFFECTIVE RESOLUTION BY SCREEN LOCATION BY ALTERING RASTERIZATION PARAMETERS" = something something **Foveated rendering**.

*(also, thanks to /u/nmezib: "Foveated rendering isn't "FOVeated rendering" because the name doesn't come from FOV (Field of View) but rather from "fovea," which is the center of the retina where image clarity is highest.")*

For you who don't know, foveated rendering means that the GPU is rendering only the part of the screen you're looking at, thus minimising the impact on GPU. This is Sony's best kept secret so far, but I believe once the PSVR will be out, this will be confirmed officially. It's also a very similar technique to the Forward Renderer of The Lab.

Also, let's look at Refresh Rate. Both the VIVE and the Oculus Rift state that 90Hz (or, FPS) is the sweet spot for high-quality VR - which means, no nausea. 

There is a scientific explanation for that. Your brain will perceive 60FPS motion around you as smooth and life-like. But to perceive your movement as life-like, you need 90Hz (FPS). 

So, 60FPS is really the entry barrier for looking at content, and 90 is the barrier for interacting with content.

HTC Vive and Oculus Rift both ask to hit the 90FPS mark immediately, and have as a fail-safe respectively Reprojection and Asynchronous TimeWarp. Which one of the two is better only time will tell, but ideally they are both only there as parachutes when for whatever reason you don't hit 90FPS.

PSVR goes in a different direction. It will use 60FPS as a baseline and re-project to 120. Honestly, this might work very well for "spectator mode", but I have my doubts on high-paced action games where the player needs to move much (anything like Longbow, Hover Junkers, etc). Time will tell!

--

**TRACKING SYSTEM**

Last but not least, the tracking system. Everyone that experiences RoomScale and tracked controllers knows that this kind of interaction is what makes VR a jump into the future instead of a mere head-tracked camera. Also, a perfect, 0ms Lag tracking system is what separates nausea-free VR from The Vomit Inducer Experience which is so far any other VR system.

The **Samsung GEAR VR** has no real tracking system; your head movement is tracked internally by the gyroscope+accelerometer of the phone, which incredibly results in an acceptable experience with ~20ms lag.

We all know that **HTC Vive** Lighthouse tracking is incredibly good, with sub-millimeter precision and  ~11ms Lag. This is done by using two light-emitting base stations, which we call Lighthouses, while all the sensors are placed on the HMD and controllers. This is hands down the best tracking method around from a technical standpoint, and we all know how cool is it.

The **Oculus Rift** uses a tracking method called "Constellation" (latency  ~13ms), which consists of external infrared tracking sensors which optically track specially designed VR devices. So it's basically the opposite of the Vive; at the moment of writing, Oculus users have one tacking camera for Front-facing experiences. Once Touch is gonna be out, two cameras will be needed for a 180 degrees front facing experience. 

Oculus stresses that 180 degrees is where devs should focus their effort, and this sparked the debate "Is the Rift capable of Room-Scale"? The answer is still not certain, but a quick Google search will yield positive results. Also, it is worth noting that SteamVR supports Oculus and Touch controllers, and apparently, Oculus version of RoomScale with two or three cameras. The quality of this version of RoomScale is yet to be known. 

**PSVR** uses the PSCamera and Move controllers. The Move Controllers are tracked light points. I wont go into the whole dissertation on how hard is to track light points this way, and lets just assume that Sony knows what theyre doing. So PSVR will be capable of 60Hz ~18ms tracking of controller/headset. Since its a single tracking point, probably its gonna be a front-facing experience only, or with limited 360 degrees turns. Bonus: your PS4 standard controller is tracked in VR as well.



**CONCLUSIONS**

From all of that, and personal preferences aside, we can clearly state that from a pure capabilities point of view the HTC Vive is the HMD with the widest range of features, and the PSVR is the one with the most smart tech built in. GearVR is the HMD for an entry level VR. Oculus Rift is the most polished one, but only time will tell if Touch will be on par with the Vive wands, and if the RoomScale capabilities will be as perfect as the Vive.

Gaming and console history taught me one thing: content is key. The fact that we have more than one HMD on more than one platform is a great thing for content; the more the merrier. 

Only time will tell which HMD is gonna be more successful than the others, but one thing is certain: VR is here, and is here to stay.

What a time to be alive!

<TEXT> Hi guys,

Elite Dangerous is definitely one of the killer games for the Vive. I'm a space junkie, but playing E:D in VR with my HOTAS is just mind-blowing. I didn't play it before VR because I wanted to experience the full immersion immediately and I'm glad I did.

Now to the original question: what are your best settings for E:D? I tried modifying some of the VR High settings because it was running fine - I only get stutter in busy spaceports- but then tried supersampling and boy everything looks crispier (apparently the original SS/AA I'm Elite doesn't really make a difference). 

So before I push too hard, is there any Commander out there with my same GPU that tried all the possible configurations and finally found the perfect balance?

I will play with configs myself and report back so others might benefit from my tinkering! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before playing with the Vive, I thought that solutions like Virtuix Omni (treadmills) would be the answer to the locomotion for Open World games. But those solutions are bulky, expensive, and don't consider the various actions of crouching, dodging etc (I know there are some that will allow you to do so, but c'mon they're huge). 

I truly believe that Devs have to come up with creative solutions, like EdgeWalk by /u/SocialNetwooky or RIPmotion. Maybe a combination of the two.

But for me, having to play Fallout 4 and moving with a stick and not with my body would be a no-no.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a MSI GTX970 Twin Frozr V with a Steam VR Test score of 8.6 (non-overclocked).

I can play every latest AAA title (The Witcher3, Batman:AK etc) with everything or close to everything set to Ultra @ 1080p 60FPS.

So far the only noticeable frame drops in VR have been in PoolNationVR (I can only play in Medium) and in the last mission of House of the Dying Sun (everything set to Ultra, AA8x).

I was thinking that maybe I will upgrade GPU around Christmas time. I thought to spend on a GTX980, then saw some benchmarks (I know it's early but) and decided, maybe a 1070.

Then AMD released the low-price great-spec card. And I started to think that yes, VR doesn't support SLI (yet), but maybe in the future it will, with one card per eye. 

Which means I might simply need another 970, until a next-gen headset is revealed with higher resolution (my guesstimate is at least 18 months from now, not for lack of quality screens but GPU power in the market).

What are your thoughts?

<TEXT> So, HOTDS is a GREAT GAME. It's the best Early Access I've seen so far, and a super experience - piloting a ship in space? I'm sold.

I have an old, cheap HOTAS, and since the game supports binding, I spent the time to configure it and HO-LEE CRAP. I'm Captain Adama in my Viper. 

After having played half of the game, I went on Amazon to purchase a proper HOTAS (I can only imagine E:D in VR, or maybe - fingers crossed! - No Men's Sky). I was about to purchase a X52, but then I stopped. And you should wait too.

Because in 6/12 months, I'm SURE someone will com out with tracked controllers, HOTAS, the whole shenanigans. So you'll always see them in VR. 

The phrase I'm muttering the most lately is, What a time to be alive!

**tl;dr**: wait to buy HOTAS/wheels, as surely there'll be tracked versions soon! And buy House of the Dying Sun if you're into Space Dogfighting.

<TEXT> Hi guys,

just wanted to collect in one thread all the performance discussion around PoolNation VR. It seems so far the most demanding game out for VR.

I know it still needs "optimisation" and the devs are working on improvements every moment.

For me, I cannot play at higher than MEDIUM (with reprojection on). If I go on High I have serious stuttering and ULTRA is not playable.

my system:

- MSI GTX970 Twin Frozr V
- Intel i5 6400 3.2 Ghz
- 16GB DDR4 RAM
- SSD

Is that on par with the other people around here? 

See you later for a game of pool ;)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There is an interesting conversation going on over /r/pcgaming : click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/4lx82u/if_youre_thinking_of_getting_into_vr_please_dont/)

Where people are going against Oculus (I understand why).

But, many "hardcore gamers" are still bashing the VR movement right now, because they are asking "can I play DOOM" and similar. Which is totally understandable.

Without entering the discussion, I came up with a simile and I wanted to share it.

VR is like diving, or space exploration. You need to strap yourself in plastic, wear a bulky thing on you, use other devices to interact with the environment. And much like diving, your FOV is restricted and your movements are limited, and things get blurry plenty of the time.

But the reward is to be there, in worlds you couldn't touch otherwise.

And much alike the first explorers, our suits are bulkier, our tech is limited; but our hearts are bigger and our minds travel afar, to push boundaries forward, for the love of exploration.

<TITLE> Vive Demo night tonight for small group of people. Suggestions accepted! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-31 12:32:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

I've been demoing my Vive to quite a few people since I got it, but tonight it's gonna be my first group (4-5 people). 

So far I've demoed it to people who were not gamers nor tech savvy, so I went to the full tutorial FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE, and acted as a human chaperone to protect my TV, then put them into theBlu (which is mind-blowing). 

A request I've had is "I want to float into space" and even tho the solar system in the Lab is pretty cool, I'd like something more. Irrational Exuberance might cut it even tho might freak out some people. Suggestions welcome.

There is only one hard-core gamer tonight, so with him I'll skip the tutorial (he tried the Vive briefly) and put him into Space Pirate Traning, but as last user because it's gonna get sweaty.

That's my plan! how do you handle group demos? 

**EDIT: the demo night was good! People had fun, and wanted to try different things. As soon as they get the hang of it, I've noticed that people want interactivity - so it was tutorial first, the Blu second, and then Job Simulator. Two people tried and loved Unseen Diplomacy, and if there was more time, I am sure they would have tried everything (but Brookhaven Experiment ;).

Definitely going to get a VR cover for demo nights, and I need to reposition one lighthouse because we found a blinds spot.

Overall, I can say that introducing people to VR is part of the fun of being an early adopter!

Thank you all for the suggestions!**

<DATE> 2016-05-26 10:50:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

I'll skip over the fact that this is the most incredible tech I've ever tried in my life (and I work for a tech company!), that AltspaceVR is a uber-cyberpunk experience, that my wife who is a tech luddite spent one afternoon giggling while flipping bacon in Job Simulator and telling me "just one more order and I'll exit" - let's go straight to the questions, since I didn't really skip the rest :)

- I connected my iPhone with the Vive. I get notifications but can't act on them. I am confident it's an iOS limitation but wanted to double check with Android users: can you reply to text messages while in VR?

- My playspace is currently 3.5meters x 2.9 meters. Lighthouses are ~5 meters apart. I have more space and can actually go 4x4.5 meters but this will give me a 6meters distance between the lighthouses. I know they can support it but am worried about tracking quality, so any real life experience would be appreciated.

- Is there any other Vive Spaces (like Museum etc)? I can't seem to find any.

- If you want to hang out in AltspaceVR (not right now!) come find me! I'll gladly say hello.

I'm very happy to be part of the early adopters of this incredible technology. The future is now guys, and it's up to us to spread the word! :)

bonus anecdote: I was in AltspaceVR yesterday and more than one guy asked me why I had "things coming out of my hands". They were my controllers. The guy owned a Oculus. He had no clue about the VIVE. More advertising for this might be good...

**EDIT: also, I wanted to buy different-colored wrist straps, so I can 1) easily identify right and left hand and 2) substitute the flimsy bundled ones. Any suggestion for the brand / direct Amazon UK link? Thanks!**

<TITLE> [Marketing] At the start of my promotional journey. Sharing my current situation, and asking for advice! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-14 11:12:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

After having finished my book 2 years ago, I never stopped writing, so finally I feel I have enough content ready to start promoting myself (1 book; 1 novella + short stories; Poems; Ongoing book). 
My plan is to publish the novella first (september?), then the poems, then in January 2017 the full book, then maybe the short stories in spring.

I have a very good understanding of marketing thanks to my job experiences, but I'd like to hear from more experienced writers.

My aim will be to self pub - because the industry as I see it doesn't promote talent anymore but only looks out for the next YA movie deal. Cormac McCarthy would strugge to find an agent. That's my opinion.

Before I get obvious comments: Yes I do have a stellar cover designer, yes I paid good money to editors to have all of my soon-to-be-published material shine. 

Now I'm at the audience building stage.

I have only 300 followers on twitter (~~https://twitter.com/subject508182~~ http://twitter.com/dariowrites), and I hate following people there because then it becomes a marketing masturbation party (buy my book! No! Buy mine! No! Buy mine! No!).
I use twitter to post aphorisms and links to my website (every time I post new content). It doesn't yield much and I'm willingly to change my strategy here, but honestly I don't see much twitter potential for those things.

I have a website (~~www.deadmennaked.com~~ www.dariowrites.com) where I am posting an ongoing thriller/news about my work when it gets published somewhere. The website has a very small following (40 trustful readers, plus the random ones, for a total avg of 150 visits per month since its opening in January). 

I didn't publicise it so far because I didn't have much content on it. Now that I'm in the middle of the story, I'm ready to publicise it (so people who arrive at the website will actually have more to read). I still have to understand how to best advertise it. Thoughts?

I am sending short stories out to Literary Magazines. So far I've been published in 3, with a fourth upcoming in May (yay! Ego boost!). I will keep writing shorts and trying LitMag because it's good for recognition (more than exposure I think). 

Yesterday I opened a Facebook page (www.Facebook.com/dariowrites). As I don't have a personal Facebook profile, I will have to manually tell people about it. Ideally I'd use the Facebook page as main outlet to build an audience (or potential audience), while linking my main website, and using twitter to blast out thoughts. How is still an ongoing question for me.

So my questions are really to the successful guys here (/u/michaelJsullivan, I'll wait for you :)). How did you promote in the start? I mean, practically, how did you get your facebook/twitter/website out there? did you go on other websites and comment? Did you asked friends to promote you?

Every suggestion helps guys. I've been on /r/writing for 3 years now, I learned a lot, I hopefully shared good insights, and if I haven't been active lately is because I wrote a shit-ton. 

Thanks for the time and help you're gonna give me, and sorry about the long post!

Dario.

(And yes, that's my real name)

**EDIT: Took immediately /u/jimhodgson 's advice and consolidated my brand. Thanks.**

<TEXT> Hey! Long time no see, r/writing! 

I've finally received the answer from the 2 agents that requested my full MS (4 months ago! Super quick market, huh?).

Negative.

Apart from the normal feeling of rejection, what really sets me off is that neither one of the 2 agents provided a feedback on the book. Just a "Sorry, we read it with interest, not for us". Heck, I've got better rejections to queries! 

I pinged the first agent and he never replied.
I pinged the second agent today, ~~so let's see~~ and she's been very nice in replying and giving a couple of pointers about why she didn't feel the right girl for the job.

I understand they're busy and all. But in my job, I reply to every single email I receive, even with just a one-liner - it's called being professional.

What is your experience? Did you get your feedback after a full request?

Thanks!

<TEXT> Hi guys.

So far I've queried 43 agents. 12 of those 43 rejected my query (one actually did not reject, but so much time has passed I've lost hopes).

2 agents have my full manuscript - one has had it for two months, the other for 2 weeks.

1 Agent has a partial (50 Pages) since one month.

I'm biting my nails and composing drafts to those agents. "Dear agent. I hope you read my book and liked it. Why didn't you reply?". Cancel. Click.

"Dear agent. You have my 50 pages in your hand since one month. My 12yo son reads much quicker than you. Sincerely." Cancel.

"Dear agent. I am in incredible pain here. The urge to nudge is crazy. Do you realize that you have such power on us poor authors? Is your heart black and evil, to have you choose this job only to have that power on people? Looking forward to your multi-million offer."

I know I'm even "lucky" to have 3 requests. But man, the wait is crazy.

I'll share my basic query letter in a next post. I suggest you do the same.

<TEXT> Hi guys,

being myself in the Query process for my book, I know how dreadful is the feeling that accompanies the process.

Some of the questions I've had in my mind:

- Is my Query Letter good enough?
- How do I know that's the right agent?
- Should I nudge after the query? (NO!)
- Well, should I nudge for a partial or full request?
- What are some new agents that are open to queries?

And many many more. I know there are websites and services that help authors with those questions, but there's nothing like reddit.

So I thought to found  /r/queryhell. It's a place for all of us who are querying and waiting. And waiting. And waiting.

We can share resources, opinions, help each other with the queries and support each other in the (very, very) long time from the submission of a query to the offer of representation.

I just started it, and immediately came here to give the good news. I will start posting useful things in the next few days (new agents accepting queries, articles etc) but I would love for it to be a community effort.

I hope you'll like it guys, and I hope we'll help each other there!

<TEXT> We believe that writing is not a hobby. 
Writing is a call. 

It is the blood that burns and the soul that crumbles and gets distilled in words. 
It is the solitary scanner upon the path of the souls. 

We believe there's no right amount of words for a book, but there's only just enough words to tell a story truthfully. 

We believe that our job is to write; to write truthfully, to write beautifully, to write without adverbs possibly. 

We believe that with the right story and the right writing and the right agent, our book will see the light.

<TEXT> Hi guys,

I'd like trad-pub writers to help me out here. 

If I sign with an agent in the US, am I free to sign with another agency in the UK? Canada? Australia? Etc etc?

I suppose it depends from the contract you sign, but I'd like to know from more experienced writers what is the norm / best practices. 

Thank you in advance!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Discussion] The art of querying </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-17 10:55:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

I wanted to talk about queries. I'm myself in the middle of the query process. To kick off the discussion around query styles, timing etc, I'll start by outlining where I am at.

First and foremost, I am not *heavily* querying for 2 main reasons:

1. I am *so* naive I am handpicking agents and agencies, hoping to find my perfect agent match * la Charlie Runkle*
2. I am not sure the same query works for every agency.

To expand on point 2: what works for Agency A won't work for Agency B. If you have a complex novel, which crosses over different genres, then you might have different way of pitching it.

To me it resolved (so far) in 3 types of queries' tone:

- **Lighthearted:** That's the first type I sent out to certain agencies. It follows the classic query structure - Introduction, synopsis, bio, closing paragraph. It looks more like a business letter than everything, with a more light tone of the prose to align with the agency and highlight that part of the novel.

- **Philosophical:** As my book touches various philosophical topics, I highlighted that part more. Using the same classical structure, I simply added to the synopsis my comments on the meaning of the parts of the book - an "extended version". Tone is business-as-usual, but it steers more towards literary, with accent on more thought-heavy parts of the novel.

- **Same-as-book:** If you're like me and read tons of thousands of queries and agents' advice, you know that one thing the agents ask for is to be able to get the book from the query. That's very hard of course - we wrote an entire book, now we've to cram it on one page. So I wrote the query with a more "experimental" angle. I wrote it with the same prose and pace of the book. It's more "literary" than a business letter, but I point this out at the very end - you wanted to see my book's style? Here ya go.

So far I've sent **12 queries in 2 months**. 5 of them "lighthearted", 2 of them "Philosophical", and 5 of them "Same-as-book". 

**2 rejections and 1 request of full manuscript so far.** Silence from the other agencies. First deadlines for "if you don't hear back from us then we're not interested" ends at the beginning of May.

So, that's me at the moment. I might develop other queries for other styles.

But let's talk about *you!*

How is your query process? Do you have different queries for different agents? Do you think a query should be "Classic" or are you getting creative with it?

And, for published authors: How was your query process? How long before you had in your hands the "perfect query" which eventually led to agent - publication?

Thanks, and sorry for the long post :)

<TEXT> Hi guys,

Straightforward: I have an agent from a top-notch agency who has my manuscript. It's been in his hands for almost a month. 

I know it's not much. I know I should just patiently wait (and send out more queries, which never hurts).

But I am human, for chrissake. I am tempted to give a nudge to ask if he's liking it. Or something.

Thoughts? Advice?

<TEXT> Hi guys!

I'm very very new to 3d print. I have a Silver ring which is a tad large.

I'd like to "encase" it into another ring - silicone, metal, you name it. Ideally, something I can easily swap in-out if I need, but it's not a priority.

I've seen ring guards on amazon but I wanted a full circle encase, with borders and whatnot - something that "shows" behind/around the ring.

I don't know if I explained myself well, but if some of you understood, can you help me figure out what would the best path to get one be?

many many thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should I remove my old first work from iBooks? [advice request] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-31 16:37:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

I have a short Novella self-published in some of the digital marketplaces (not Amazon, tho). 

I self-pubbed it some years ago, for free. It's 52 pages written when I was 20 in my mother-tongue language, and it's been downloaded 5000 times. The 2 reviews are very positive and it has an average score of 3.5 stars. 

I am now writing in English and the style is very different (and not just because of the language difference - also because I am a much more mature writer).

As I am pursuing the trad-pub route, should I remove this old piece of work? I don't recognize myself in it anymore honestly, but it gives me right as a Goodreads author - and kind of a small validation for future works. Maybe. I'm not sure.

What would you do?

Thanks!

<TEXT> Hi guys,

as per subject - this is really aimed at Pro Fiction Writers who marketed themselves (especially in the beginning of a trad-pub deal and/or at the beginning of their -successful- self-pub career). 

I will just shoot the questions here.

- What did you find useful to do (if anything) to market your book BEFORE its publication?

- How did you tackle previews and reviews, apart from the ones handled by your agent/publisher?

- Did you market *yourself* as well? Like social media, websites etc. Did you find it useful?

- Can you share some tips tricks? 


I appreciate all the kind replies you will want to leave here.

<TEXT> Hi guys,

I noticed that since I had ayahuasca I am more sensitive to other substances - even normal Marijuana has a "deeper" effect on my perceived self - It is easier to feel my consciousness expanding and recall the ayahuasca experience.

Is there any correlation between ayahuasca usage and permanent or semi-permanent sensibility to other mind-altering substances? If so, is it a change in brain chemistry (i.e. are there studies on it?) or it's a *perceptive* change (which, imho, is the same)?

<TITLE> Questions about dialogue structures. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-07 12:05:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi fellas,

straight to the point: I am having some issues with dialogues. Not heavy ones, I just can't seem to decide which dialogue style would suit me best. So I'm asking your opinion as skilled readers: which style of dialogue do you prefer the most? Examples:

**Standard:**

"Hey you", said Joe. "Didn't see you there. How are you?"

"Not bad" replied Jane. "I always come here on Saturdays, haven't you noticed?"

"I thought it was only a one off," replied Joe.

"Nope. Here's the best to buy candies."

.

**Semicolon** (sorry about the Reddit Formatting):

- Hey you. Didn't see you there, Jane.
- Hi Joe. Why, I always come here on Saturdays.
- Oh, I thought it was just a one-off.
- No, that's my favourite place to bury bodies.

.

**McCharty/Bukowskian:**

Hey you, Jane.

Hey Joe. Long time no see.

Didn't see you, in fact. Whatcha doing here?

I always come here.

I never saw you.

That's because you never pay attention when I blow the horn.


---

Of course, some of them will inspire different dialogue styles - but my aim is to have a very natural dialogue way, without getting in the reader's way. 

Do you guys have any preference? Do you perceive the style much different, or are confused by some?

Thanks for all of you who will want to reply! </TEXT>

<TITLE> I remember the days when there was no such thing as self-publishing. [a rant, probably] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-11 15:12:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> And I remember a lot of people complaining about the "Dark powers" of the publishing houses (in music, literature, etc). People complaining that Publishing houses were keeping talents at bay, just to sell the writers that could make them money. In total honesty, I thought so myself. I was dreaming of a world were PH would have no saying.

Well, I live in this world. Now everyone can self-publish. Everyone can save some money to hire an editor, a graphic designer, and create a decent product to sell. Amazon et cetera are the distribution channel. A curated twitter account is a good marketing channel - better than the old "book readings" from unknown authors.

So I look around, and I am looking for the new Joyces, the new Wallaces, the new DeLillos; all I find, in a sea of mediocre-to-terrible stuff and Rule-34 Porn, is some honest guy who wrote some ok stuff - and for as much empathy as I might have for my fellow writer, it's not enough. I have a list of thousands of books to read, by incredible authors, and I know I will never read them all. So why should I stop for the ok things? I aim for the best. 

And the promise that a world without publishers would have been a better world fell short; and like a cheating lover, I go back to the publishing houses, to ask for their guidance to find something more than decent in the sea of self-publish.

*TL;DR I am not so sure that self-publishing unleashed creativity of lesser-commercial writers, heightening the emerging of indie-cool stories, but actually flooded the market with crap. And Publishing houses still hold the keys to the kingdom of "Good Stories".*

**EDIT: Thanks guys for your points of view! I was asleep in my timezone and am now reading/replying where I can. The shared opinion is that yes, there's a lot of crap, but also very nice little gems. So I guess really the problem lies down with Vanity from the writers, lack of curation for the finished products, and lack of curated "lists" (reviews are not to be trusted unless they're many, many...many) by sub-genre that can help us navigate this monstrous sea of words.**

<TEXT> Hi guys,

It's been a while since I posted something here. I am at the end of my novel (technically the second, but it's really the first as I am writing after 10 years). I am probably anywhere between 5 to 20k words away from the "Grand Finale". 

I have the outline of the ending, the "message" I'd like to send and so on. But I feel that, to really understand and write this last part, I have to re-read everything I wrote (which will inevitably turning into editing). 

This is because the characters evolved (and devolved!) in the course of the 75000 words I wrote, and now I feel the urge to go back, re-shape them with what I know, and finally conclude the thing. Looking back, this is how I actually wrote the ending of my first novelette.

What would be your advice? Should I endure, resist the urge, and write the ending, leaving space for the final editing, or should I let the temptation win, start the first-editing, and then write the ending??

I know that any advice is purely personal - but that's what I am looking for; experience.

Thanks for all your help!

<TEXT> I am usually a very good cook. I am creative, you see. I can make up amazing dishes and entertain my guests with A-grade appetisers. I know my wine as well; there won't be anything but the perfect glass together with your meal.


I see a dish, taste a flavour; they compose themselves, easily, in my mouth, without having to taste anything. I copy chefs, make their recipes better.


I have trained myself, in the coming of age, to the mastery of vegetarian cuisine, then vegan; no one of my guests ever felt the need of meat, and wondered at how did I make their mouth feel this.


But Burritos.


Seriously. I thought I was baking a kickass lil-donkey, until a wicked night of 2 years ago. I was brought by some friends to the magic place where burritos are born from Angel's laughters. "El Farolito" in the Mission, San Francisco. For you that live in the bay area, just drop everything you're doing and go there to have one.


Even if they are not vegan, their vegetarian option made me rethink my whole burrito-life.


Since that, I have been miserable. All my attempts have failed; my gift has gone. It seems like my rice is not as fluffy, my veggies not as grilled, like their released the sun they've used to grow. My guacamole, once exposed with pride, is put to shame, like a commercial counterpart, to the chunkiness of El Farolito. I am lost in an endless journey, burrito after burrito, towards that juicy perfection, the one, only amazing burrito that I tasted in a midsummer's evening, that rejoiced my soul.


So, I am asking you, reddit: what is your best shot at a burrito? The bar is high. Vegan would be my first choice, but I am willingly to go vegetarian for this one. Shameful, I know.

*I highly encourage linking this post in your favourite sub about writing. This way more people can enjoy the love! Please keep reference to this original post if you can so that our own /r/writing gets credit for it :)*

Hey guys,

I reached out the guys behind Scrivener, the famous software that many of us use/want to use.

They have been incredibly happy to hear there's so much love for their software, so much that implemented a nice 20% discount! I have no informations on how long this will stay in place. Here are their words:

Hello XXX,
We've implemented a 20% discount coupon code for the Reddit community. If
they now go to our web-store www.getscrivener.com and type REDDIT into the
obvious coupon code field after selecting their Scrivener 2.x for Mac OS X or
Scrivener for Windows *regular* licence, they will then benefit from a 20%
discount.

So I would suggest to all of you guys that are interested to avail of this! They also commented on their upcoming iOS app:

We're still working incredibly hard on our Scrivener for iOS release. We'd
love to get it out this year, but our schedule appears to be drifting into
2015. It's shaping up nicely though. ;-)

I hope the /r/writing community will appreciate that! :)

<TITLE> The Writer toolbox </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-22 14:12:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Seems obvious, but the device and the tools that you physically use to write have to be chosen according to your needs. A writer is not only the tormented artist who sits in a caf with his Mac and scribbles over a napkin. A writer can be a journalist, a tech writer, an instructional designer, a professor. Here is a list of some of the most used tools.

**LAPTOPS   DESKTOPS** - any will do, but here are some favourites:

*MacBooks (Air, Pro)* - lightweight, powerful, has access to some Mac-only tools. Lit-up keyboard. Expensive.
*Chromebooks* - lightweight, relatively inexpensive. The OS is a bit limiting and forces the use of Google Docs. There are guides on how to install Linux on them.

**SOFTWARE**

*Scrivener*

Made by a writer, this tool acts as a repository of all the content (scenes, ideas, research material, pictures etc). It is also very useful for outlining and plotting. There is a bit of learning curve and the interface can be daunting, but it is a star software. Two downsides so far: Mac Only, and lack of syncing with mobile devices as there is no App available.
Link here: www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php

*Emacs*

Extensible, customisable text editor. It has a steep learning curve but it is highly customisable if you know how to get your hands dirty with code. It can handle document-specific dictionaries (not on a project level) which is useful when world-building. Open source.
Link here: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/


*nvALT (Notational Velocity)*

This is a great note-taking software. Simple and immediate. nvALT has an unusual interface. It only has three sections: A search line, a list of your notes, and an editing box. To create or find a note, you type in the search field and it narrows down the displayed notes as you type. Press ENTER to create a new note with whatever title you've typed in. The cursor moves to the editing window and you can start typing your note. It saves automatically. You can just open it (with a hotkey), enter your new note, and quit. Each note is saved as a separate text file in whatever folder you've set it to sync to. You can access and edit them in any program that will edit plain text.
Its simplicity and plain-text format allow the usage with any word processor. Mac Only.Link here: http://notational.net


*Notepad++*

Free notepad app. A step above the stock Notepad/Notes app, with multi-language environment, customisable GUI, Search/Replace, bookmark. Windows Only. 
Link here: http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.7.html


*Mac Notes App*

The stock notes app on any Mac/iOs device. Plain text. It made in the list only because it has automatic syncing and back-up to the cloud.


*MS Word*

Probably the most famous basic word processor. Remember to save often and back up your data.



**BACKUP / SYNCING**

Ok, youve written 2000, 10000 words. Great! Did you remember to press save? Do you have a fort-knox level vault where you store physical copy of your work? It does not matter how much you write - just remember to save!

<TITLE> Different books, different styles; when the author is perceived as cheating on his audience. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-20 13:57:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

this should be more a question than a statement maybe. 

Most of us like an author for different reasons - may it be because he creates world that we love, or has an incredible pace, an exquisite prose, or compelling characters. 

JK Rowling founded her success on *consistency*; HP stories are a known world to the reader, and people love to dive into known waters. It is a sure bet. Now she is writing different things, and she chose a pseudonym. 
Same did our old friend Stephen King; he, the master of horror, when ready to publish his fantasy novel, decided to do it under a nickname. 

So it is safe to assume that once established in a genre, a style, a writer gains followers and audience that like him for what it is.

How bad is for you when your favourite writer broke his/her familiarity with something different? Did you forgive him/her? Did you like them more because they were more "rounded", like the characters we all try to breathe life into?

Looking forward to your answers. </TEXT>

<TITLE> New to vinyl - bad, low sound from existing setup - HELP! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-11 14:34:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

me and my SO decided to enter the vinyl world. Disclaimer: we're on a budget so we want to start small and build up.

We bought a turntable (Auna TT931).
We have active speakers (Bose Companion 3 Series II) that provide good sound (I know, they're not the best for vinyl, but that's it). They have JackInput.

Now, plugging the turntable directly to the speakers through RCAtoJack cable produces the sound, even though not the best one; volume is really low, and basses are cut out completely. 

Being the speakers active, I supposedly thought I needed a Pre-Amp to pump the sound up. 
Wrong. 
The PreAmp jumps the volume up, but then I have a constant static buzz, and crackles, and when the music starts to get more intense, distortions and bad sound.

I know there are millions of things, and I know that the perfect setup would be GreatTurntable+PhonoPreAmp+Amp+PassiveSpeakers... but for the moment, do you have any suggestion? Do I have to ditch everything and start again?

Any help will be appreciated!

thank you all!

**EDIT: So I run some other tests. I discovered my Turntable does not need grounding, and on the manual it says "Just plug it to your Amplifier+Speakers". Which in my mind means it does not need a PreAmp.**

**With the current setup, Turntable + Active Speakers, I get a sound just passable, not even decent.
If I add the PreAmp (grounded), I get a boost in the sound, but a loud constant hum, and cracking noise as soon as the song that's plain goes a bit up in volume.
I tried with smaller, different speakers (active) and the result is more or less the same. I came to the conclusion that I won't need a PreAmp, but better speakers - possibly Amplifier+PassiveSpeakers.
Thanks for your reply, and if you have more suggestions, please write them down! :)** </TEXT>

<TITLE> Re-entering the US within the 90 days of the Visa Waiver Program </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello travelers,

I have been one week in the US last week for work, and I am coming back next week for holidays with my girlfriend. 

At the entrance of the US border I have been granted a VWP permit of 90 days. Reading on the US embassy it states that I can re-enter the country with no problems (at discretion of the border agent) unless it shows I wanna try and stay there.

I have return tickets to my country of residence, where I work, and this should be enough proof even to skeptical guys.

My question is, do I have to show the border agent that I have already been approved a VWP permit? Or will they re-start it? 

It's the first time I travel so closely in time to the US and I have no clue! :)

thanks!

tl;dr Going in the US for the second time in a short period of time, don't know how it works with the VISA etc. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

me and my wife are Vegetarians and transitioning into Veganism. 

*(funny part, I was a great meat-eater, swore never to give up meat, then turned vegetarian, swore never to turn vegan, and hey, here I am reading labels and not buying animal-derived products anymore)*

We are also planning to have kids sooner than later. 
When we started to be Veggie, we told ourselves that we would have not forced our diet on to our kids (still brainwashed at the time, huh). 

Now that we are aware of how incredibly healthier a Vegan lifestyle can be both for humans   environment, we are wondering to raise our kids (when we will be blessed with) on a Vegan diet. Of course if they'll ever want to taste meat, dairy, eggs, we won't stop them - they have to decide for themselves - but we will make them aware, in the most objective way, of everything they will want to do, without limiting their freedom (a lot of good will here eh?).

Finally, the question: did you raise your kids up Vegans? Was it difficult? Did you integrate in any way their diet (B12 et similia)? 

Please help!

Meditation always helped me to calm my mind and emotions, but in the last days I am not able to do it. I'm restless and overwhelmed by thoughts.

<TITLE> Questioning the utility of Reality Checks. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-16 16:42:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last night I was dreaming (non-lucid). I had to go to an appointment and I was late, so I told myself "I'll never make it by foot. Let's fly there". So I start flying just by waving my arms like a bird. Midway to my arrival point, I look down, stop waving arms, and say to myself "Wait, that's impossible. I am dreaming!!!" excited for the revelation, I decide to take a reality check to confirm, and then do whatever. As soon as I try the nose blow, I got a false negative (no air passes) and I think "Shit, it's reality. I better avoid to fly on that lake then in case I fall".

First: I laughed myself off when I awoke. 

Secondly: I'm doing meditation every day, RCs between 5-20 per day, and am studying Dream Yoga to practice ADA. 

In the dream yoga there's no reference for the need of reality checks. You just really need to be focused in recognising your current state (awareness). 

I'm starting to think that RC are overrated, and ADA and Dream recall/journaling are the best way to go there.

Before starting to study LaBerge (which is in my book list), I wanted to ask the community: what do you think of RCs? Where the practice of RCs come from? Would you think that reaching lucidity is not strictly connected with RCs?

For me, RCs work great when doing FILD but the subsequent LD is usually not vivid, low-light ambient etc.

WILD, never managed to reach lucidity with it.

DILD, I managed to get lucid twice.

So far, apart when FILDing, my RCs have always been false negative in my dreams, thus preventing my lucidity.

I'm looking forward to hear your thoughts. </TEXT>

I am writing a scene of my book where the main character wakes up drunk and finds his best friend dead (by natural causes, meaning that there is no visible sign of fight, shots, blood etc) in the bathtub. After the normal shock he calls the police and waits for them in his apartment.

The scene I wrote is a really "quiet" one, meaning that 3 people arrive at the apartment, 2 go them check on the body in the bathroom and the third questions the Main Character about what happened. No violence, no gun drawn etc. A friend that read the scene told me that this would be "unreal" in his opinion as he believe police will come into your house, be more "physical" in making sure you're not harmful, and then question you in the station and not in your house. 

Thankfully it never happened to me :D but I believe that if I find my best friend dead in my bathtub and call the police explaining what happened, they will come to my place relatively calm, without creating too much of a mess - am I wrong?

<TITLE> Dreamception (aka dreaming of lucid dreaming) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-28 12:27:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I believe I dreamt of lucid dreaming. 

I started to keep a dream journal a week ago, doing my ADA, and my favorite RC is to close my nose and try to breath - if I breathe with my nostrils closed, I'm dreaming :)

Also, I started to try FILD every night, with mixed results. It happened to me twice to recognise I was dreaming, and immediately waking up from excitement. Not last night. 

So i was trying to go lucid using FILD.  First attempt of reality check, I realize I was dreaming!! This time no panic, I do not wake up, try immediately to visualize something (I was in total darkness). This does not work and I feel the lucidity is going away, so I simply try to focus and stabilize. So as I realize I don't have full control over the dream, I try to "trick" my brain to obtain informations. So I shout a question "what's the purpose of life and all?" And suddenly a green field appears, very lovely place, with my grave. I don't feel scared - it's a dream - and anyway I'm constantly exploring my 'fear of death' so I kind of know it's one of my greatest fears. At this point I feel I have more control, and try to fly. I float up 5,6 feet, and then everything turns blank and the dream ends... And now what makes me think I was not really lucid: instead of waking up at the end of the dream, I dream that I'm in reality! I do my checks and they work, so I believe I'm real and I'm walking down the street. I decide to do a "deep" awareness moment, and suddenly I walk in slow-motion and "feel" everything around me - people, sounds, the sidewalk. It was a great sensation and told me that LD will bring me more awareness of my real world.
Maybe I did LD and then slipped into a normal dream. After the "reality" dream, Then I slipped in a second dream that involved enemies and guns and bazooka.

Scary thou that my mind led me to believe that a dream is reality. This can mess you up long term I believe.

tl;dr - I'm not sure if I LD or dreamed of lucid dreaming, and then I dreamed that my dream was reality.

I'll try in my country first (which is English-speaking) but as is a small one, I want to try in the US as well.

Writers around here, how do I get published in the US?

{NOTE: Please spare comment like "write a good book" etc. I know I've to write something good to have the chance, the question here is more technical!} </TEXT>

<TITLE> Reddit, do you think Apple will eventually unveil a proper TV?  </TITLE>

<TEXT> And, if so, what would be the game-changer feature? Broadcasters partnerships?

I think that the killer opt would be the chance to play REAL games on it as well. That would be the perfect device to buy; good for the father, to watch sports   check internet; good for the mother, to use Facetime and chat with friends; and good for the kids, that will be able to play directly.

What's your opinion, Reddit? What are the features that you would like in a "Smart" TV? </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Strange Sounds in the sky... Explained. </TITLE>

<TEXT> Redditors,
you know that strange sound that people hear, coming from the sky, which freaks them out? You know that some of them thinks it's God, some others think it's some kind of super-secret weapon (like the HAARP), while others think it's an alien sound?
Well...

It's the Schumann resonance. 

*(from Wikipedia: The Schumann resonances (SR) are a set of spectrum peaks in the extremely low frequency (ELF) portion of the Earth's electromagnetic field spectrum. Schumann resonances are global electromagnetic resonances, excited by lightning discharges in the cavity formed by the Earth's surface and the ionosphere.)*

When the sun strikes a flare, it creates an electromagnetic storm that will reach the Earth. Usually this storm has no impact on our everyday life, but sometimes it can be so strong that make communications cease, or cause black-outs. Some other times, it reaches a certain "frequency" (we are talking about waves) that matches the frequencies of the ionosphere cavity of the Earth, making it... sound. It's an amazing thing, it's like our planet and the sun talking together. 

Nikola Tesla calculated this frequency and said it was about 8Hz. Schumann frequencies are between 3Hz and 60Hz, so when the sun strikes at 8Hz its magnetic storm... Earth sounds like a diapason.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking for a strategy game on Mac. I am undecided between Civilization V or Star Wars: Empire at War, but as I'm long outside the gaming world, I accept suggestion! Only limit: it has to run on Mac! </TEXT>
