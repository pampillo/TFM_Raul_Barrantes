<TEXT> the UK need to realise that Brexit means no influence over future pollicy, but that they still have to follow EU rule, if they want to be able to trade freely with the rest of the EU countries.

And the EU needs to realise that the level of free trade that the UK wants will very likely stop short of anything that requires EU rules to apply domestically in the UK. Of course the UK will have to abide by EU rules on exports to the EU and on activities in the EU, as it does when trading with any other country, that's essentially normal behaviour (and EU countries will have to abide by UK rules in their dealings in the UK..). 

The issue in the article is an obvious one, if the EU insists that citizens living in the U.K. are protected by EU law under the ECJ then there is no reasonable way to come to an agreement.  The UK isn't going to be subject to EU law domestically and the UK is not going to give EU citizens additional recourse to a court outside of the UK, and agree to give it jurisdiction in the UK. AS someone else pointed out, it's not like the EU, or EU member states are going to agree to protections under UK law, enforced by UK courts in their own countries for UK citizens.

So yeah, getting rid of tariffs will likely be a UK aim. That makes sense for the UK, less so for some other EU countries.

I'd be willing to bet that the answer to that is the obvious one, being part of a group that is internally free, but considerably less free in it's external dealings isn't the same as dealing as freely as possible with the rest of the world (and the UK's trade is pretty global..).

I was at a cafe buying a bacon butty and a coffee and it came to something like 5.43, given I had some loose change,  I dug out 43p and and handed over 10.43 (10 note plus the change). I got a bemused look from the cashier, who proceeded to hand me back the coinage, explain I'd paid her too much and then give me 4.57 in change, including IIRC, 7 1p coins.  I think people generally (both those selling and those buying..) have forgotten how cash works given the amount of card usage now, about the only place I seem to get sane change is in the market.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indeed, and in my view they are right. The complaint from the EU side is quite similar to the complaints against Microsoft way back when, essentially Google has about 75% of the market share with Android in the top 5 European markets, and they are abusing that position to push search and browser technology (by requiring manufacturers to bundle). 

It goes a bit beyond that too, they are also apparently using licensing agreements to push google as the default search, and to prevent alternate OS's being shipped, as well as offering financial incentives to networks.  All in that sounds pretty anti-comparative, from a dominant force in the market, and seems a lot like someone is using the area where they have dominance to enter into and dominate new areas.

I don't think the same arguments would apply to the likes of chromebooks though, because google don't dominate anything laptop or desktop related (bar search..) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been on Debian for a long time now, and as a result my other half, kids and so on are too. In terms of usability, I use KDE on the desktop and have a preference for quite a few of the KDE apps, so it broadly works very well and has done for a long time.  There have been some patchy transitions between major versions (although.. waiting generally solves that).

No I have managed Windows machines going back to XP and I'd say that over the last decade or so, the difference in terms of ease between managing a single Windows box and a single Debian box *on well supported hardware* is about the same, if you ignore how comfortable you are with one or the other.

In some areas Debian is a massive improvement too, updates tend to be less painful, are central and don't take forever.  Software installation is obviously easier and, since I broadly don't need to use non-debian sourced software, it's nicely centralised and safe.

That said, there are still the usual issues of lack of equivalent software in some areas (gaming to a certain extent is one), that's mostly not an issue for me, but for someone coming to Debian from a different platform and wanting a specific app, the change in approach can be problematic, some programs are not available, others available in ways that are not easy to install or manage.

In terms of UI, Debian and KDE have been great, you have a consistent visual style, common user interface between applications, an understandable and common way of managing things etc.. It essentially works well and is intuitive enough that my kids can generally just get on with stuff.

I also still very much enjoy the fact that I can approach any admin (say, sorting photos) task either via a specific application, a file manager, or via the command-line and scripting something. It has been a very long time since I've felt I *had* to use a particular approach or didn't have the right tools available.

Of course, I've essentially had a slowly evolving set up, that has been largely under my control for a long time, so you could argue I'm just used to things working the way that they do and potentially that isn't the best way. That may be true, but at the same time I like the fact that my OS and DE essentially get out of the way when I need to get on.  The opposite seems true regularly with Windows.

Lastly, half the reason I have been able to have a fairly evolutionary experience is that it's trivial to move data and configurations between devices. I think for the last few years at least, a hardware upgrade has essentially involved moving my disk from one machine to another, replacing a disk involved simply restoring a backup. Even where I have done fresh install's Debian (which these days really is a quick and pain free process), the amount of time required has been incredibly small between having a new device and a running machine, complete with OS, applications and data.

Oh, and one last thing. I moved an elderly (as in 90) relative across to Debian + KDE a few years ago, from Windoes (I think Vista..) essentially to make it easier to support her.  It was something that wen't remarkably well. The customisable nature of the DE and the stability of the OS meant I could set up and be reasonably sure it would continue to work, whilst removing complications from the DE and making everything nice and simple (to the point of removing menu items etc..).  Essentially there is flexibility there that far exceeds what you have in other environments.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The Liberals didn't show the signs of a turnaround on Thursday

There weren't locals in Sheffield on Thursday so we don't really have much to gauge it on except possibly the almost 8% gain they had in the locals in 2016. Essentially their 2010 coalition entry cost them a run of second places in Sheffield, they were within 150 votes of Labour in 2010, then fourth, behind the Tories and the Greens, with a swing of 31% in 2015, with the Greens getting nowhere close. It won't take a lot to push them back up above the greens at that point if there is movement, of if the 2016 locals are even a mild indicator.

 I can see the Greens capitalising on that in their better seats, such as Norwich South and Sheffield Central. But without the student vote its much harder.

The student vote in Sheffield is massive, possibly the largest in the country, and I'd argue it was a factor in 2015 (and I assume contributed significantly to the Lib Dem support in the past). I'd query how sticky it is in terms of green support though..

That said, there are some local issues that might help, the whole street trees thing has been handled badly by the Labour council for example.  Then again you also have the mild issue around things like EU support, arguably Paul Blomfield has a decent advantage there, he campaigned heavily for leave, has been visible on the issues and is now on the Shadow brexit team making it clear that he wants the UK to leave on good terms... All in it's not a clear picture, but I don't think the Greens in Sheffield will see significant improvements as it stands, I think they'd have done better if they had managed to keep hold of Jillian Creasy as a candidate in terms of credibility and presence, and I sort of wonder if this election is going to make it harder for the Greens to really campaign on their issues.

But I suppose we'll see soon enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  They'll also be much closer in Norwich South and Sheffield Central, I think Norwich South is in reach.

I doubt that they will be much closer in Sheffield, Jillian Creasy had a fairly large personal following, parachuting Natalie Bennett in may sound good, but I'm not sure it'll do what the Greens want it to (although I may be a bit biased, I thought Jillian Creasy was pretty good, and I've seen her outside of election periods, I've only seen Natalie Bennett on TV and she hasn't really impressed..). 

Obviously the local party seems pretty enamoured with the notion and quite positive, but I doubt that they'll be able to go from being a little over 17,000 votes short to anything that anyone would count as close. I'd imagine some of the 3k UKIP voters will end up voting Labour and some of the Lib Dem collapse will reverse pulling votes from the Greens.. All in, unless something really major changes, I don't think Sheffield will be close for the Greens, and I wouldn't be surprised if it weren't even closer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's partly because most of their policies are sensible and well thought out (the entire green policy set is worth reading IMHO..), some really aren't. I like the bulk of Green party policy, but I wouldn't vote green because of the outliers (well that and that I don't particularly think the candidate they are standing where I am is really who I'd want as an MP compared to the incumbent..).  Small parties can and often do have some really good policy ideas, go and look at a few.. what they don't seem to be able to present is any way of getting those policies into law, and they often mix some real shite in with the good ideas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Well I hope it evolves because it isn't working very well now.

I do too, but I don't think it will (I voted leave in the UK referendum at least in part because I didn't think the EU could become what I would want it to be, and instead was workign toward something I dind't like...). 

 I just think there isn't an alternative model for the EU waiting to take its place.

There isn't a comprehensive model, but there are lots of structures that have existed and continue to work. Things like ESA show that cooperation outside of the context of the EU works, NATO is effective in bringing together European countries in the context of defence (and there are a slew of bilateral agreements in Europe too). If rather than looking for one model that sits on top of Europe and touches everything, you look at a looser framework, then we do have several models to choose from and lots of potential to drive forward where there is consensus amongst fewer states, rather than trying to drive everything forward as a group of 27.

Its a false hope of some EU-skeptics to suggest that starting again with a looser arrangement is going to work.

I suppose the point isn't so much starting again, as it is looking pragmatically  for solutions to problems. If the EU isn't in a position to solve an issue, there is no reason why a different approach can't be taken.

I don't pretend to have all the answers to resolve the tensions in the EU but for now I'm staying against much deeper integration, because the biggest mistakes can often be made in reaction to big failures like Brexit. It could be further integration or a two speed approach actually makes things worse.

Yeah, I don't disagree. Pushing reform in a crisis, or something quite close to one, doesn't mean you get the best reform, usually it means you get a kludge that just about addresses the visible issues..

One thing I'm pretty sure of, the EU needs some big wins to capture the imagination of the citizenry again. Single issue consensus projects that move fast and deliver benefits to people. A few of those and things will quickly look more positive all around.

Indeed, an EU driven by its citizens would be quite an interesting beast. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  European cooperation isn't available in different flavours though. 

Yes.. It is. The EU cooperates with non-EU European countries, and even within the EU there are differing levels of opt out in terms of cooperation and integration.  The idea that the EU is the be all and end all for every EU country, or that there isn't a better way, whether evolutionary or otherwise (i.e. starting from scratch..) isn't accurate.

Many (perhaps most) of us staying in the eu are also not convinced about deeper integration.

The problem is that to support a lot of what the EU has started, it's actually needed. You can't have deeper common defence cooperation without deeper integration, the Euro arguably needs deeper integration and the shifting of some core fiscal responsibilities to the EU level, the same goes for things like immigration, and that's only the really contentious issues currently.

Either the EU frameworks have to change quite a lot for things to work, or there need to be more competing frameworks that allow countries to find the best mechanism for cooperation in different areas.  The attempt to create a monolithic approach with everything being in the context of the EU might not be the best one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  People all over Europe have decided that cooperation   unity are too difficult, so they let themselves lose.

Or that the EU isn't the last word on cooperation   unity.  Cooperation and unity are possible without the EU, with a different EU and within the current EU, the question really is about what you are willing to accept and what your idea of European unity and cooperation is. Brexit didn't show that people are cowards, it's an expression that the EU in its current form isn't right for everyone. Most people on the leave side, including the current government are entirely in favour of cooperation, they draw the line at deep integration, and that's not unreasonable at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it? The risk of terrorism has been higher in the past when there were larger ideological differences, indeed between the hard left, hard right and armed separatist groups it seems terrorism in Europe and elsewhere isn't reliant on Muslims.  It is the focus at the moment, and rightly so given the threat currently, but I'm not sure that religion alone (as opposed to the more radical ideologies promoted by terrorist groups) is the driving factor. 

That said issues around integration mean you have different interactions between the police and intelligence services and the Muslim communities in various European countries, not to mention that there is a massive variation between established communities.. Take the Yemeni community in the North of England, it has been around for almost a century and doesn't seem to have many issues with terrorism, the same isn't true for other groups in other parts of the country.

The problem is extremism, whether imported or already extant. That needs to be dealt with. </TEXT>

Indeed, but the risk exists. I've lived in larger and smaller cities and haven't experienced one, but experienced the impact in terms of security measures taken to deter terrorism. My other half lived in a reasonably sized city and saw one terrorist attack.. The point is the threat is there, terrorist attacks are part and parcel of living in a big city, you can't avoid them entirely, you can be luckier than others, but you can't get away from the threat. </TEXT>

I mean, you could end up in a situation where you have 10 green MP's but they have essentially no voting power in Parliament, or no UKIP MP's, but they are supposed to have a significant share of the party political vote share in parliament.  You'd also create strange issues around party loyalty and the whip etc.

<TEXT> This switch has been really weird in terms of impact.. I've got a spark and my other half has one too and they've both come through reasonably well. In fact apart from having to switch back to the launcher I had before, and the slight changes with the Android assistant it hasn't been that noticeable apart from breaking the version of Apollo I had on mine (And I need to sort that out, but google play works too..).  I did have one moment of drama when my phone kept dropping the bluetooth connection and partially rebooting in the car but I realised I hadn't done a cold start since the upgrade and doing one seems to have gotten rid of that issue entirely.

However one of the other guys I know with one has been saying that essentially it has caused no end of issues with reboots and problems with battery saving stuff just not working.. This is the same hardware, now running the same OS, the only differences can be in terms of apps and some config options.. Which doesn't seem like it'd be enough to create such wildly different experiences..

I think there is an update due fairly soon to address some of the reported problems, I really hope it does because I really like my phone and it has worked well so far. It'd be really shite to end up in a position where that changes, or where half the userbase is pissed off because of hard to track down problems. </TEXT>

To be fair, it's not a long time ago and life hasn't changed that much (if anything, between the prevalence of kids having mobile phones and the reductions in crime) risks are much lower. What I'm saying is that there has been and continues to be a societal change where we treat people as adults later and later, that has been accelerating recently.  There also seem to be bigger divisions in terms of where we are talking about, rather than just how long ago.. I mean, I'm not suggesting kids should be working in mines, I'm bemoaning the fact that people (both parents and kids) seem less happy with the idea of their kids working in shops, restaurants and cinemas for a few hours a week and that we are entering a world where those jobs aren't just supporting some 16 year olds dvd habit, but instead supposed to be full time work for adults..

<TEXT> At 16 you aren't a child but you aren't really fully an adult either, but at that point you do have a lot of decisions that you have to make and I'd argue that you need to be able to make them independently of your parents at least to some degree. 

I'd also argue that the current trend of pushing off adulthood isn't great, it used to be far more common for people to get part time jobs from 14 and on, essentially so you had some money to spend and I'd argue it was quite beneficial. Working 6-12 hours a week, even whilst still in school is perfectly manageable at that point without having an impact on education (Whether after school or at the weekend..). The problem now seems to be that the jobs that kids used to get, especially in shops and so on, are now being done by older people as their primary employment, rather than by young people temporarily.

I'd add that this is a relatively recent change, when I left school most of my friends had jobs, those that didn't got jobs between school and whatever they were doing next too.  There does seem to be a bit of a split between people living in towns and larger cities (no idea about rural areas...). 

Where I am in a moderately sized city, when I speak to parents of kids at around 16, it seems both the parents and the kids are far more concerned and indeed reticent about work for reasons like stress, travel, whether they can do it, social interaction and so on. It's really quite depressing. My in laws live in a town though, and my brother in law owns a shop and does employ people under 16 and seems to always have a few people who are interested, the view seems quite different, it is seen as positive and the kids doing it enjoy having money to spend.  Same goes for my kids, my eldest is really pleased that he can get a few hours work at a weekend if he wants them (and organises it in advance..) even if it means spending 10 to get there and back by train..

Personally I think work at that age is useful in developmental terms, you work with people who are older than you, understand that you get paid, get to make choices about money you have earned etc..  As long as it doesn't interfere with school and kids still have a reasonable amount of free time I really don't see a problem. It's far better than some of the alternatives parents seem to like (I've had people say that they really like that their kid is essentially in the house all the time playing on the play-station, because that means they know they aren't getting into trouble...). It also seems to build confidence, again to the point that my eldest is happy to take public transport, decide he wants to go to the climbing club or do whatever else, whilst some of his mates really don't seem to be able to do much independently.  </TEXT>

Absolutely, although the actual impact will still largely be conjecture.  Essentially you can argue that the UK would have done better in the EU even if the UK does very well over the next decade, and you can argue that the UK has done better that it would have in the EU even if it does badly.  You can also argue that UK government policy has a much bigger impact on the UK economy, employment and pretty much everything else, than the EU membership does. </TEXT>

The really problematic issue that you can throw in here is that they often can't take out  cheaper contracts, can't buy in bulk, don't have access to cheaper services, can't buy expensive stuff that lasts and so pay more for things that aren't as good, as someone who is a bit better off. Being poor can make a lot of things more expensive rather than less.

<TEXT> The argument would be that the Euro is overvalued for Ireland, essentially the same argument that is made in relation to say Greece and Italy, usually coupled with the notion that Germany benefits the most because if it had it's own currency, it would be considerably stronger than the Euro.  That said, it's hard to make a concrete claim, and there are other benefits in terms of confidence and stability in the Euro which some national currencies wouldn't have.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Northern Ireland went 56% remain, but support for leaving the UK is lower.  I'd assume that there would be more important issues for Northern Irish voters on both sides of the union debate than EU membership to base their position on too. 

Obviously there is an element of sectarianism in politics in Northern Ireland, but it goes beyond that to a certain extent, I think I am right in saying that the smaller of the two big unionist parties in Northern Ireland, the UUP supported remain in the EU referendum.  I think the polling showed that about 10% of republican voters wen't for leave and almost 20% of unionist voters went remain, and 80% of alliance/green voters opting for remain..

<TEXT> Interesting nonetheless, but your point, that there is no appetite in Ireland to leave the EU is really quite important. That belief in the project is a large part of what makes EU membership attractive to people, I'd argue that it's more important than the economic benefits. When people talk about people in the UK having made a 'stupid' decision, because they didn't prioritise the economic impact, they miss the point that much of the support for the EU is also for 'stupid' reasons, it is about the political aspects, the idea of the union and so on.  It'd have been much less likely for the UK to leave the EU if it had bought more into the political project something that I think people in Ireland have done to a much larger extent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah fair play. I think there is a difference here in a sense in that the EU has in the past played with the timing of decisions and announcements to boost support, or reduce opposition around elections. In the past that hasn't really been an issue, now though the timed release of statements (say on Euro clearing which was apparently rushed, or the push to present the 'largest' number on the leaving bill) it does seem like political manoeuvring by the EU during an election, and in a manner intended to interfere, rather than simply the existence of one causing a particular view etc..

That said, I get the impression that a lot of what the EU is talking about is for internal EU consumption, or rather I hope it is, because nothing that has come out so far really looks to help the EU position, but instead seems to be causing more of a rift (that May is exploiting rather than suffering from).

I think this whole affair should be handled with infinitely more tact and decorum.


Absolutely, in fact the whole come back thing from May on the dinner leaks was, in my view, incredibly silly. She could have ignored it and it might have diffused things a bit, and left her looking like the bigger person. Instead she tried to channel Margaret Thatcher... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not much of an article, but I hadn't seen it anywhere else:

*Three U.S. Republican House lawmakers threw their support behind their party's healthcare overhaul plan on Wednesday after crafting changes to provide $8 billion over five years to shore up coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.*

*Representatives Fred Upton and Billy Long, who had rejected an earlier bill to roll back the 2010 Affordable Care Act, told reporters after a meeting with Trump at the White House that they could now vote for the plan with their proposed changes.*

*Upton said the revised bill could come up for a vote on Thursday, although both he and Long said they did not know whether there were enough votes to pass it. Representative Michael Burgess also said he could back the legislation.*

So a vote as early as tomorrow, with some Republicans formerly opposed switching their support.  Someone with more of an overview of the current state of the votes in the house could probably shed light on how much that changes things, although I assume if they are calling a vote on the revised bill for tomorrow that someone is confident..

Oh and since people are suggesting contacting people - you can find details on your representative [here](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/)  </TEXT>

I suppose the breach there would be around the reporting of donations (which is the responsibility of the party, not the donor), unless there was collusion to hide the source from the party, or collusion to hide the source from the EC.

In either case, there doesn't seem to be enough there for that yet. Be interesting to see if anything else comes out.

Should be easy enough to do the math and see that this is not going to lead to some major political fallout and the EU ending

<TEXT> Honestly, do you think people from whatever side actually know what Brexit really means right now?

They know it means leaving the EU.. The question was whether the UK should be in the EU or out of it, everything beyond is up for debate and negotiation... It's a bit like suggesting that no-one really knows the implications of voting Labour or Tory in a general election, because you don't know whether they will have an absolute majority, or end up in a coalition, whether they will drop a pledge, or do something unexpected etc..

The referendum set a direction, that was to leave the EU, everything else about that is essentially up for grabs.

A new referendum isn't going to solve that either, because frankly even at the end of the negotiations there are going to be disputes about the impact of the resultant agreement, questions about future trade deals etc.. I think /u/aoide12's point is that we've had a referendum, the government and much of parliament has resolved to take the UK out of the EU, so that should happen at this point, rather than asking the country if they are really sure.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You'd be surprised how many have admitted they were looking at leaving, pr at least divverting a significant amount of work to Europe. Remember the UK is not just walking away from the EU..it's walking away from around 60 linked trade deals.

I would be, most of the manufacturing firms I've spoken to or worked with aren't looking at moving, although they tend to be small and specialised. The largest has a lot of US contracts so I suppose they'd be relatively well insulated, unless the US does something daft, which seems more likely these days..

It basically does. But you are right, there is give and take..but in negotiations, the US gives less and takes more.

Except it doesn't. It's been trying to do something rather interesting over the past few decades with the TT* agreements, in that it has been trying to impose a framework on essentially the global economy (to the exclusion of China..) and hasn't really done that well even if you discount the current Trump lunacy. There has been push back from individual countries that have significantly moderated the approach and, the approach could well be argued (bar a few bits at least) as generally beneficial to all parties.

In short, if the US can't muscle it's way into trade dominance through treaties (rather than simply sheer capacity) the EU, which has not been very good at leveraging soft power at the best of times isn't going to be able to force the issue with what will be a fairly major regional power..

Look at the China/Swiss deal as an example..you open your market to us for ten years, before you sell into ours.

Thats a pretty gross misrepresentation of the treaty, not to mention that Switzerland essentially managed to open up a very large market for its services in the process. A similar deal for the UK would be incredibly beneficial to the UK, but it isn't going to get it via the EU given the current EU/China positions. Switzerland even managed to get concessions on IP and investment...

The EU has the advantage also because of the size and diversity of markets. 

It's an advantage, it doesn't confer 'the advantage'. Looking at trade deals from the perspective of one party winning and one losing is simply not terribly appropriate.

For example, if Brexit makes delivery of UK goods to a German company unreliable or too expensive, an Italian company that was making widgets for the UK, but was too expensive for the German company suddenly has the incentive to make up the UK losses. 

Absolutely. But that's the case with any country that has agreements with other countries and access to a large market. Hell, it applies even where there is no FTA in place, UK companies are competing with china on sales to other EU countries now, even though China doesn't have a comprehensive FTA..

Or the UK company starts producing on the continent. 

That only works if the UK company's market is largely in the EU, otherwise it cuts itself off from the UK domestic market to the same extent that any other EU company is. And again, the UK has a very large domestic market (much larger than the value of its exports).

Either way, the EU wins. The UK generally doesn't have the huge OEMs to sustain a domestic supply chain.

The EU doesn't win, because it loses access to the UK market to the same degree, it's a smaller loss, but it is still a loss. Throw in areas where the UK is very good, and indeed the likelihood that the UK will pursue a fairly liberal trade policy and you are back to the old protectionism vs free trade argument. The latter generally wins.. On that point too the EU has an issue, it has far more that it has to protect, and currently does so (look at CETA for example). The UK (who is Canada's largest trading partner by far in the EU) will likely benefit from a UK/Canada agreement with fewer barriers because it can do so where the EU can't. 

Now you are right that the EU is going to use whatever leverage it can in the talks and it is going to protect its members interest, but it isn't as skewed as you suggest and a mutually beneficial arrangement, where both sides 'win' is entirely possible and, given it's the usual aim of trade negotiations, fairly likely.

I don't think there will be an agreement because I don't think the UK government is being realistic. They are focussing on a UKIP wishlist instead of something that is achievable. 

The information we have so far about negotiating positions, as slim as it is on both sides, doesn't suggest that the UK government is being unrealistic, or that they are focusing on a UKIP wishlist at all.. Where do you see that in what we know about the initial positions?

They are being dishonest with the population in leading them to believe that it is possible. Then when it becomes apparent that it was pie in the sky all along..the big bad EU will be punishing us.

Again, this doesn't seem to fit with the reality of the situation. The government has said the negations will be hard, and complex.  They have said that they want the freest possible trade terms within the context of being outside of the EU single market. That's entirely realistic, largely because it is pretty vague.  The point to note though is that barrier (tariff and NTB) free trade for goods is very likely. It's harder for services (although MIFID II will make it easier for finance..) but then the EU's services market is a mess anyway.  What exactly do you feel is dishonest in the current non-tabloid presentation?

I don't really get your argument about the euro clearing.. 

Reserve currencies are cleared globally. If you want your currency to be viable in a global context, you can't apply protectionist measures.  

I'm guessing the EU countries will just decide to make a centre to deal with their own clearing. I'm sure they can't completely stop London clearing..but they can make a conscious decision not to use London, which will then probably force banks to relocate resources as it's too profitable to miss out on.

Clearing doesn't happen in isolation or just in London, you need large markets to make it efficient. If the Euro forces clearing into the Eurozone it doesn't just lock out London, but every other global financial centre (the second largest in Europe is also outside of the EU by the way) including those in the US and Asia.  There are also usually lots of currencies involved (essentially.. it's complicated). The reason that London handles almost two thirds of Euro clearing isn't because it's in the EU (and not in the Eurozone..), it's because it also has a huge share of the clearing business for other currencies. Nowhere in the EU does either.. In short it'd undermine the Euro, it wouldn't come close to being offset by banks opening branches in the EU either, it'd severely undermine confidence in the Euro, which you can't really afford at the moment. It's also not a new push by the EU.

<TEXT> The problem you and others have here is that negotiations and agreements between countries don't just rely on size, both sides have to find the agreement as positive, or they simply don't sign.  If that weren't the case, then the US would dominate every trading relationship, the EU, without the UK would be dominated by China and the US too.. Small countries would all be screwed.. Yet that isn't the case.

As to Euro clearing - if the EU were insane enough to try and move it, it would kill the Euro. The EU wants the Euro to be a credible reserve currency, protectionism of the sort you are suggesting would kill that, it'd be abnormal globally... The EU could do it, but it'd harm itself far more than it would harm the UK.

As tot he rest, the UK is a huge manufacturing country, with a very large domestic market. Manufacturers aren't going to leave because they rely on the UK domestic market (which is much larger than what the UK has in exports..), not to mention that they produce for a global market, and, even if the UK were to have no deal with the EU, they'd still be able to export there too..

The point is that the UK and EU have to find a mutually beneficial agreement, or there won't be one. The EU has a lot of things that the UK wants, and the UK has a lot of things the EU wants, if no agreement is reached then yes, both sides get hurt, the UK a bit more, but the EU is nowhere close to being in a position to dictate terms, it doesn't have all the cards, it has some, and the question really is how much harm the EU is willing to inflict on itself on the basis of ideology, if it acts in that manner rather than on the basis practical self interest.

But hey, you can go with the 'they are so much bigger than us' argument if you prefer.

<TEXT> So..

A quick look at the electoral commission site shows cash donations of 3,688,720.39 and 512,088.61 in non cash donations from IPGL Ltd to the conservative party between 14/04/2005 and 24/02/2017.  There are no loans recorded to the conservative party from IPGL.

HSBC has loaned 897,250.00 to a selection of UK political parties over the last few years though, not just the Tories of course.

I also just listened to what I assume are the relevant portions of the AGM (because, you know, it's Tuesday..). The points made were that IPGL were over-leveraged, and that HSBC made loans anyway, and that those loans (200m) were used to make donations to the Tories.  The argument goes that HSBC, as IPGL's lender must have known about the loans and so may have breached HSBC's own policies..

I had a quick look at IPGLs accounts [here](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/document-api-images-prod/docs/0APe2ufqv8DxDj4edbT0eZMQRq_3ZDXgaFa5FRsB4FI/application-pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAIFFJONWK2YG5HFMA Expires=1493763895 Signature=cypj%2F%2BOY0TIJcK28ZYlSAoCWzwo%3D x-amz-security-token=FQoDYXdzEKz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDDvve33oT2Va7KVyQSK3A8d0TP5WvoVYl97QDESKbN0pvB%2BddhGLgWImoxLbFsSxf2v%2BLANUEYbLBKXoK%2FVnHIAMOPAeGuVm0udGt6u2AKVOCstiG8xGpHG0jRCQVuZFEOJ1XNL0fuF2%2FUyMA6sQ69%2Bf0tNuKp3U6gW9Q%2B1PGZISc%2BH1Oxo1yGYrsZMw1gjBrLYdVBSxs3mcQCcdrKIZdJueZoe4drmzOq41RHA43UyiSm1lk9Rd%2B2s3%2BUv8YXqP5AQ0Y7JwSPFD7RTPuH7091n2Nh5ayjUI8LtkomQDkOLdVbCfMPMWSoULM8sq4rVIhQm0Zy%2F0xlWmxZfIDgeTRtkr5UBvy52x7SV6tmKbC82RzT9AHR%2FqB39SX1BjPTgTbOp6qd8iKLUMqd5PF196BSnbWbxD%2FUoPgxTB4rXhLiwgZql%2F9fZv0NnV0SwR1nnlLaP2TtN1ZuQAYqRkZBbbyrr15wXkR87Ox3ZxMCndg5%2FGsn6Hme9p%2FI9b8HrbOD0J7CIGv7k2wNYDw4lv0x8u5kv%2FS36V5gib7XgRQQKJYFT7qSSUCzQn6eRzjnQfHnezv4bRDtkUVEnUdk0tQTX%2FOmMoZOdvzSQo26SjyAU%3D), which suggest it does make money and can afford the loans though,

The statement from the HSBC board at the AGM was obviously very neutral, and so arguably they didn't refute the points, they mostly seemed to brush them off. In fact they refused to talk about individual companies at all.

It's interesting, and certainly troubling, but I'm not sure if 'laundering' is an appropriate term at that point.  

From the letter, I'm also not sure whether you can construe a loan, or a series of loans, to a company that is a going concern, that then donates to a political party as essentially a proxy loan either. Or at least not without quite a lot more information. I'm also not sure how the electoral commission could, even in conjunction with companies house and HMRC make that call. At the end of the day, the liability would sit with the borrower, not the Conservatives.

All in, unless there is unreported money in here somewhere, or evidence of collusion between HSBC and the conservatives, via IPGL, it just looks like the usual large business donations to the Tories.  You can draw your own conclusions as to why of course..

Now I'm not saying there isn't an issue here, but it's horribly easy to string these things together. I just took the first large corporate Labour party donor from the electoral commission site, the company made a large (although not Tory large..) donation in 2010.  In the same year it got a 100 million credit facility even though it showed only a very small profit (and in 2009 showed a fairly large operating loss)... I then looked at the people related to the company and it turns turns out that the chairman was a prominent labour member and donor at the time. I doubt that the credit facility was set up to channel money to the party though.. And like I said, that was a random first stab, go grab one yourself and have a go.. It's almost fun.

I guess what I'm saying (beyond that we need to find a way to keep big money away from politics..) is that asking about this is right, but it's not as damning in my view (at least yet) as the letter seems to suggest, there are a few dots missing before the lines join up.

Edit: As a side not the whole Mr Ethical and moveyourmoney stuff that is out there is well worth reading, there are a few holes, but it does cast a light on some pretty dodgy looking moves in relation to finance and corruption..

<TEXT> Why? Because you didn't get bombed in WW2 as hard as we did and so you had a very easy time to recover?

No...? Because the benefits of EU membership are significant in Poland, and have been evaluated by the Polish government. Poland had further to go and has done so quickly because EU membership offered things like stability for political institutions and access to a large market. Poland had institutional issues during and after the transition from communism that the UK hasn't had to deal with, it is a much greater beneficiary (rightly..) of development funding and so sees a large positive benefit in cash terms as well as political, social and economic.  That's very different from the situation in the UK for obvious reasons.  

I'm not suggesting that the UK didn't see benefits from the EU, but they fall far short of the benefits that Poland saw.

Nobody knows, if we could manage better on our own and maybe we would have rebuilt most of our infrastructure faster without any ""help"" from the EU.

I have no idea what you are talking about here now.. Neither the UK, nor Poland had help from the EU in rebuilding after WWII if that's what you are referencing, both went through some modernisation whilst in the EU (and both went through some before membership too for that matter..) but Poland was in a far worse state on joining than the UK was and it saw significant benefits in a reasonably short period of time...

True, like the fact that we got a bit of money for rebuilding parts of our highway routes? But what about the point of a free market. NOBODY knows, if we maybe had a way better situation right now, if we produced more stuff IN our country and don't import most stuff. NOBODY knows if it wasn't smarter to just trade with a few partners and export only in these.

You can create scenario's where Poland does better outside of the EU than inside it, not massively credibly, but I suppose you could.. The point however is that Poland has seen significant benefits from EU membership, it's much harder to argue that Poland could have done better outside, because it has done very well in the EU. 

If you can see in alternative realities

I can't, and I'm not suggesting I can. What I can see however are the benefits that the UK, and Poland get from the EU and look at the costs and note that Poland has some massive benefits that the UK doesn't have and so it's harder to argue that EU membership is not a good thing for Poland...

Trump was criticized by people like you (that already know what will happen in the future, apparently) that he want's to limit the trades with other countries and instead produce most wares in his own country.

Not sure what Trump has to do with anything.. but if your point is around whether limiting trade, or enabling trade is a good thing, then broadly I'd agree with the school of thought that trade is broadly beneficial to a country..

If it fails = People say: Hah, told ya. Trump has no idea what's doing. If it's good = People say: Hah, should have done that in the past 20 years already. See? It works!


Again, not sure why Trump is relevant.

We are talking about benefits of EU membership, the Polish government have looked at that over the last decade and outlined the improvements that Poland has seen, and the benefits that Poland feels it has had as a result of EU membership.. </TEXT>

Last I checked, Northern Ireland was part of 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland' and people from the UK (often used as a short term for the above..) are often referred to, and often refer to themselves as British.

<TEXT> You think the EU should just give unconditional bailouts? That's cute. 

Where did I say that? I said that the conditions attached to the various stages of the bailout were problematic, not that the bailout should have been unconditional.

Greece didn't have to accept the EU bailout, they had a choice. They could have instead faced the consequences of their own borrowing and economy. They didn't, they chose a bailout.

Indeed, they were faced with two pretty nasty choices and tool the one they felt was less damaging.  That doesn't mean that the choice they took wasn't problematic, or that the choices offered were the only ones that could have been offered.  

Again you seem to think you can blame the EU for Greece's borrowing. I don't see how. The EU didn't force borrowing on Greece.

No, I don't, and I certainly haven't said so. I do however see an issue in how the bailout was structured and have a problem with the various priorities that were attached to the stability of the Euro, the Greek economy and the impact that continues to have.

 "Chose to", not "had to", because they felt the alternative was worse.

'Had to' to prevent the alternative that they felt was worse.  That doesn't change the substance of the point at all though.

<TEXT> They're part of the UK. That's the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 

Indeed, and it gets shortened variously to UK, GB and Britain, as you are well aware, and the people who live there are often referred to as British.  Why then would it be ironic for people in Northern Ireland to Identify as British?

You might as well whinge that someone corrects you when you say Northern Ireland is part of England.

Except obviously that that is wrong and not accepted shorthand for the UK, and quite annoying for a large number of people in say, Northern Ireland.

It really shouldn't be surprising, and it certainly isn't ironic that some significant number of people in Northern Ireland identify as British. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue isn't the bail out, it's the conditions that have been attached to the various bail out stages.  Greece is between a rock and a hard place, and some of the 'rock' aspect is essentially of the EU's making, the result has been pretty nasty for people and businesses in Greece, and at times at the expense of financial institutions that presented a systemic risk to the rest of the Eurozone if they weren't supported (indirectly, via bail outs to Greece..). 

It isn't just an issue in Greece (although it is amplified by the Euro..), it's essentially a much more problematic playing out of the same issue we saw in other countries, where governments had to prop up banks rather than leaving them to fail on the back of poor lending decision. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This debate is actually not really Brexit related and has gone on for a long time beforehand.

I'm aware, it has been rumbling on for quite a long time, and it's one area where the UK has been quite active. It has however been pulled out as a stick a few times, it's not as though there hasn't been a refrain from some areas (Again, since before the UK voted to leave the EU) that clearing should occur within the Eurozone (never mind the EU..). 

Basically, if the EU wants to force Euro clearing from the UK, it will be violating an ECJ ruling, and will likely need to rescind equivalence for a lot of other countries that handle Euro clearing too.

Yeah, and the EU likely won't because it'd be (as you point out) detrimental to the Euro more generally.  It's not like it hasn't been tried before, so we know what the impact would likely be.  

The concern really is around how the EU approaches these draft proposals and develops them, there is a lot of pressure from the likes of France to take a more protectionist approach (and IIRC France had exchange controls on the Franc up until 1990..) without the balancing effect of the UK, although in this area Germany is fairly sane too so...

It's widely known in the market that coordinated central bank buying has long supported the euro at its weakest points over the past few years. If that confidence goes, then all bets are off.

Yeah, and no-one in the EU wants to cut themselves off from international markets whether directly or indirectly as a result of regulation, the direction of travel (and as with MIFID..) is in the other direction.

<TEXT> The point is balance. Yes there was and is a brain drain, but there is also investment in Poland (which is now labelled by some as exploitative, when that certainly isn't the case in most instances). The question is whether the balance is right, so membership and participation in the EU is net positive for the member state in question. Obviously that is different depending on the state, but for Poland, it seems to a net positive (based on what the Polish government has said, and what others have said).  

That could change in the future, it could change for other member states, but right now it'd be pretty hard to suggest that the EU has been anything other than beneficial to Poland to at least some degree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends heavily on the way that oversight occurs, the suggestion that the move would end up "forcing UK operators to either relocate or be policed by European authorities." is quite a lot stronger than the US approach, but essentially you are right, it's a continuation of a story that has veered from the EU pulling Euro clearing into the Eurozone to the EU revamping oversight provisions. And as you point out, MIFID II is going to be quite positive generally for third countries and obviously helpful in terms of simplifying regulatory approaches..

Not a non-story though, the drafts are important, as is the approach being taken to risk.  It's probably also interesting in a political context (nothing in a vacuum and all that..).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree on it being a much larger risk.

Fair enough, but I would then ask what risk the UK poses to the EU that is much greater than the Euro taking a step on clearing that would be perceived as internationally hostile.  Although we can leave that there if you prefer (But I am seriously intrigued as what risk you see coming from the UK..). 

Apart from this and from Gibraltar, what's your take on a trade deal between the UK and the EU?

A mutually beneficial deal would be.. beneficial, and entirely possible. It'd be better to do it sooner rather than later given the current convergence on regulations and I think the EU and UK would both benefit from a continued push on the international level that maintains standards and regulatory approaches.

Although I do think the UK approach has been better and a good influence on the EU more widely.  [See this from the Government Office for science](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/381905/14-1190a-innovation-managing-risk-report.pdf), specifically (although the whole thing is worth reading..):

*...there are two fundamental confusions that bedevil debate on several important regulatory topics, particularly within Europe. The first is the
way in which the notions of hazard and risk are differently embedded in national modes of policymaking. This is why it is so important that we share a common understanding of the distinctions between hazard, risk, and vulnerability.*

*The second is a drift of interpretation of the precautionary principle from what was, in effect, a holding position pending further evidence, to what is now effectively a stop sign. To be meaningful, the precautionary principle requires a rational response to uncertainty (as distinct from risk.)*

On what basis should it be build?

On areas of mutual interest. We have a lot of overlapping interests, even outside of a political union. The UK would be looking for a looser, and so likely less comprehensive arrangement when compared to the single market, but one that is as comprehensive as possible within the political limitations that the EU is working under..

Like the customs union (preventing the UK from doing other deals)?

It seems reasonably clear that the UK is leaving both the Single Market and the Customs union, largely that is about ensuring that the UK is as free to trade with the rest of the world as is possible, presumably at least in part to counterbalance the loss of the very deep integration it had as part of the EU.

The EU said the 4 freedom are inseparable, so a full trade deal like the current one can't happen

Indeed, and that's a shame given the UK can't agree to the 4 freedoms (or rather, the principle of the four freedoms, there are still issues within the single market, some of which happen to be very important to the UK on services..). That on its own means that the UK will be looking for an FTA rather than being integrated into the single market.

How far from that full trade deal should it be?

That depends on what the EU and UK can agree on really..

Regarding the 60B sum the UK agreed to pay, should it be repaid? Should it be part of the negotiation?

The UK hasn't agreed to pay 60B AFAIKT.  That said, it seems clear that the UK has obligations, including financial ones to the EU, and the EU will likely also be seen to have financial obligations to the UK, so I'd assume a negotiated figure could be identified and paid by the UK.  That should be part of the exit negotiations of course.

I'd probably say that in terms of the negotiations, the exit and trade terms are somewhat distinct, there is some overlap, but they should be negotiated separately. There is no real reason why there can't be some concurrency though.

For anyone looking for a united Ireland, the deal between the UK and the EU is going to be pretty important.

<TEXT> The way I see it, the options are to either figure this out, or to become irrelevant in the world.

Somewhat. But I agree with the premise, however in the run up to the UK's referendum I've come to the conclusion that I don't think the EU will figure that out. It's not getting any better at the moment and frankly, once the UK leaves I can see things becoming more problematic not less, especially if weight is seen to shift more toward Germany and France.

You're right about that, but just technically. You've also got FN and PVV euroskepticism. But what the Dutch elections demonstrated is not just that these kinds of views are generally minority views which depend on foreign support to make any traction significant whatsoever, but that an even minimal counteracting of of foreign material support, such as that recommended by the AIVD was sufficient to restore the organically-occurring political minority status of Dutch euroskepticism.

I don't mean simply euroscepticism from the likes of the FN or PVV, I mean disagreements between member state governments about the role, priorities and scope of the EU. You have countries that aren't on board in terms of defence, other countries that have issues around migrant policy, other countries that are poorly served by the management of the Euro and so disagree about the direction and scope of reforms, and a whole slew of other minor and major issues.  Now in the past, say 3 years ago, I'd have said fine, that'll get worked out over time and you'll end up with a consensus that works. Now I'm not sure that is possible at all, not just because of the differences in opinion, but because there is a disconnect between popular positions, government positions, the EU position and what is actually needed to fix some of the issues the EU faces.  It's not insurmountable by any means, but I don't see there being a lot of appetite to try and tackle it from those who can.  

In essence it seems a lot of people are wary of pushing anything, in case it breaks something.  At the same time, others are building new stuff, but not on solid foundations, which means that after a certain point, people get wary of pushing to fix the foundations, because it might break something...

 The first thing that europe needs to do to get its house in order is to fix its economic institutions in such a way as that european stability can actually be had. And to a certain extend, it'll mean telling the Germans to STFU on the economic front, if we want to see europe-wide progress on things like monetary policy and institutional crisis response mechanisms.

IMO, everything will need to start on the economic front.

You probably aren't wrong, although I'm not sure that you have to start with the institutions around the Euro (and frankly, without the EU you are going to get massive pushback from non-Eurozone countries if further attempts are made to use EU institutions and mechanisms to support the Euro..). I'd argue that the first thing the EU has to do is come up with a vision for itself (one, not several options..) that member states buy into. That way the reform has an intended aim, rather than the current situation where you have several different states looking at several different aims.

Maybe agreement on a multi-speed EU has to happen first, but even that seems quite a long way from being likely given the objections raised last month. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is not a power grab. This is sensible risk management.

It's not sensible risk management, it introduces a much larger risk than the one you are suggesting might come from the UK (which is generally seen very much as the opposite of a risk, which is a factor in why it has the position it does in finance).

If you try to force Euro clearing to happen in the EU (unlike every other reserve currency on the planet, including the dollar and the pound for that matter..) you make it less attractive, if you do so on the back of essentially a protectionist, political argument, it becomes even less so.  Would you want to trade using the Euro if the EU can arbitrarily fuck around with you? Probably not.  Not to mention you'd end up with massive secondary markets springing up anyway, so it'd do little to solve whatever problem the EU is trying to solve and do everything to reduce confidence in the Euro as a reserve currency.

You are right that it isn't a power grab though, the ECB and EU can legislate and regulate however they want, that is within their control, it'd be unwise, potentially harmful and somewhat pointless, but it's not really a power grab. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The has the resources to do so (both economic/industrial and manpower/expertise). It's just a question of organizing and coordinating it more than anything else.

It goes a bit beyond that, it's about whether member states are willing to cede control in various areas to the EU. That's actually quite hard, especially when you get into areas of competing interests and national positions.

We'll see. TBF, British (and specifically Torry) skepticism has been a major roadblock to the deepening of europe. Europe's liberals have been claiming for some time now that w/o that kind of obstructionism, we'd have a more organized europe by now.

So we'll see how far this gets.

The problem there is that it isn't uniquely British scepticism (and frankly, the issue is broader than Tory scepticism..), it's arguably the difference between seeing trade as a priority and seeing the political project as a priority. That's where the clash between deeper integration and expansion occurs too. The UK is far from unique in being more pro expansion than integration.

Of course there is an opportunity for change now, as the UK leaves the political settlement is going to change, but I honestly don't think that in quite a few areas, there is enough consensus for real moves forward and a real risk of steps being taken that aren't build on a solid foundation, leading to a crisis further down the road again, it seems to be a bit of a pattern, especially where the EU is pushing things for which there isn't broad public support. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In that case, My feeling is that Guy Verhofstat's suggestion that the EU should actually finally develop some serious operational capacity on the world stage might get taken more seriously.

It might, but most of the proposals seem to be presented as ways that member states can reduce costs by working through the EU rather than creating new capabilities or capacity. It seems less about doing more, and more about having the EU do, or at least appear to do it.

And if we took capacity-building when it comes to intra-EU economic affairs, or international/military affairs more seriously, the attractiveness of membership would look very different.

That's very true, the real question is whether the EU can deliver. I ended up voting leave because I don't think the EU is capable of the reform needed to support what you are suggesting (and in other areas). Essentially I think you'll end up with a cludge that doesn't work very well, quite possibly one that creates more problems that it solves and that is quite dangerous if you are talking about defence and foreign affairs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not the identity theft, but the apparently complex process to deal with it. Where I've had issues with a business account in the past (which generally have poorer protections than individual ones) I've had the money back immediately and been able to resolve the issue fairly rapidly between a couple of emails and a phone call. I certainly didn't have to go into a branch to sign anything or have to wait for a period for transactions to be reversed.   The Identity theft protections on my personal account are (At least on paper) pretty strong, again, with immediate repayment of any money and essentially the burden on the bank to solve the problem in relation to their stuff.  That might be because my bank has reasonable protections in place to prevent someone moving or withdrawing money without a card+pin, passwords or a secure dongle etc.. but the idea that my bank would be an issue if I suffered from identity theft seems a bit bizarre (others, like say any companies that someone had set up contracts with can be harder of course).  </TEXT>

Well, this was the Economist - not really a bastion of the Radical Left.

Nor is the Times.. I'm not saying that this is some leftist conspiracy, I'm saying that the media across the board aren't exactly trying to present a nuanced picture.

And - while this may well be a "strategic" leak - I do not think even for a second that its contents are false, as it would just be too easy to disprove everything.

I doubt it's false, but I'm also willing to bet its not complete in any sense and that it fails to accurately portray the discussions that were had. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The exchange wasn't leaked by the UK government to be fair, and there are valid questions about the enforceability of 'debt' that isn't agreed.  It doesn't take much context to turn the exchange from being a Junker 'burn' of an incompetent, to something very different.  I don't think it betrays utter incompetence, bordering on stupidity, I think it's a slanted presentation of a serious issue to which there are no terribly easy answers.

My point again though is that Davis isn't an idiot, Junker presumably isn't either, both have differing positions, and both the UK government and various parts of the EU seem intent on pointing out that the other side has no idea what they are doing.  Some of the more amusing presentations of that (via the Guardian, Independent, and Times in the UK in the very least) are so one sided it's almost laughable. The EU side takes their negotiating positions as absolute fact and any notion that the UK might have different positions as idiotic and some on the UK side seem keen to take EU negotiating positions as 'threats'.. In either case, they are negotiating positions, not facts, or threats, they will move..

<TEXT> Davis seems to be a monumental idiot, totally out of his depth. 

The problem is that he isn't. I've spoken to him a few time (albeit on civil rights issues and extradition, not the EU) and he certainly isn't an idiot. That was before he was a minister, and as a minister he obviously has access to rather a lot of information and decent briefings. I seriously doubt that he is under briefed, or that the UK civil service is providing weirdly skewed information either.

I'd be really careful about assuming anyone, on the 'other side' to your position (or mine..) is an idiot, if they are doing something that looks like it might be harmful, my first question would be whether that position is subject to movement, likely to be used as leverage somewhere else, or whether from their perspective, it doesn't look as damaging as the alternatives.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got my Nougat update today and, after setting the default launcher to the google launcher (because that's what I had before..) I haven't noticed any major differences so far. I disable notifications on the lock screen so no idea about how or whether that works properly, but rotation works as expected.  I did lose a clock and calendar widget though, and I think there has been a subtle font change that I don't really like, but I'll tweak it.

Biggest annoyance so far is the truecaller dialler, but I can swap that out too..  So, so far, not too bad given there was a solid reason for the change, but I'll wait to see what happens in terms of battery life before I'm entirely happy.

Edit: Some updates. The bluetooth kept crapping out as I was driving today, that's never happened before (losing connection to the car and coming back again 10-15s later), and It randomly rebooted too.  Not happy with that, but I'll have a closer look as to what is going on.

Edit: Further. No more reboots and the bluetooth seems fine now for extended periods.. Might have just been teething problems (I've done one full reboot now) but it all seems happy, reasonably fast and stable and battery life seems OK too..

<TEXT> Not at the outer border, which is the point.

Yes at the outer border, and of the customs union, not the EU border at that, you can have goods enter the customs union via Turkey and not be inspected at all (entry based on the paperwork submitted and agreed, tariffs paid etc.. before they hit the border).

And if it doesn't want to it would have to make sure it doesn't happen, haha. And its fellow EU member states would have to insist.

On that basis any EU country could allow whatever goods it wanted into the EU via their ports given there are no internal borders.. 

All those things and checks, unless Northern Ireland is planning to accept EU regulations.

It's not and the UK won't be putting up a border, and nor will Ireland, and the EU won't demand it.. Again, this has been pretty well covered, there are lots of ways around it, the EU seems keen on that (from its own negotiating documents) so does everyone else.

Seriously, it doesn't feel like we're past "no border because don't want" here.

The thing with countries is that if they don't want something, they can generally not have it. Between the EU, Ireland and the UK, I'm really not sure who you think is going to impose a hard border..

<TEXT> It's natural and just part of the normal bureaucracy for ports and airports, but there's a land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Once the stuff is off the ship, you have a much harder time tracking it. It could be delivered to a destination in Northern Ireland and have no guarantee that it is not repacked and doesn't end up in Ireland or the rest of the EU later on. So, you could either deny entry at an Northern Irish port or do additional checks when stuff is shipped from Ireland to the rest of the EU.

Right now stuff comes across land borders without being checked at every port and border.

 I don't think it's going to be easy to find an agreement there.

If you put a border between the UK and Ireland, some Irish people are going to start blowing things up. Quite possibly not just in the UK, so there's that.. </TEXT>

Arguably yes, anything that is heavy on the server side is arguably remote processing (so my accounting app, that takes a photo of a receipt, ocr's it and adds it to a ledger etc.. or youtube when it handles the conversion of your video on upload and lets you edit etc..). There are a whole host of things where you pass the heavy lifting off on to something else, even things like web based document editing (docs..) could quite easily pull processing server side if there was a need.

<TEXT> I wouldn't call it a gimmick, if my smart phone is powerful enough to do most of what I need a desktop PC to do, why not just have monitor/keyboard/mouse terminal set-up at my desk and save a bunch of money?

Because mostly it won't be. It'll be usable, but you'd probably be better off with a cheap laptop and a cheap phone than a PC replacement phone.

 And then I don't have to worry about transferring files if I don't want to, they would all stay on one device that I always carry around.

See my other comment on this - the direction of travel is to have your data and services, calendar, email etc.. available anywhere, from anything, formatted for that device and so on.  We don't have to worry about having the right data on the right device anymore (I don't like using 3rd party services, but even I can get at anything I want, on any device, from the NAS at my house..). 

And as I said in the other comment, it's great that people are still looking at this, but I don't think the problems that we found 5 years ago have obvious solutions yet, and the world has moved in a very different direction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are right to a certain extent.. But the direction of travel has been somewhat in the other direction.

Rather than thinking about your PC or phone, or tablet or whatever, the direction has been to think about the data and applications that you use. So you can have a computer, a phone, a smart watch, a tablet etc.. and access all the stuff on your google/microsoft drive, use web apps and so on.  You don't need to use the same device, because you can have your data and applications (and music, video, photos etc..) delivered to whatever device you want, wherever you are. 

You aren't using your tiny PC to connect to your home PC, you are using both to connect to well optimised services geared toward their capabilities..

Why would you disconnect your phone from a display and keyboard at home rather than say, using your smart TV, or a cheap computer (or your voice activated gadget that can read and write to your calendar, notes, blog... etc.) to do the same thing. 

And again, that's sort of true now, I can control my PC from my laptop, manage navigation and routes that will be displayed on my phone from my PC. I can set alarms on my smart wrist band thing from my phone, or set them on my PC. I can view documents, emails, social media messages and so on on my tablet, PC, or phone, all optimised for the display and performance.

And I can do it without having to try and compromise (scaling my dual monitors onto a single phone display? Not thanks, and whilst we are at it, why do I need a 6 inch display on my phone?)..

Trying to make one device that does lots of things well in a modular fashion has been tried lots of times and it does involve compromose. It usually falls down either because you have an underpowered device (and your phone is still under-powered even compared to a cheap sub-notebook..) or you need lots of (often proprietary) bits to plug into it to make it work.  

And of course there is a temptation to create a UI for an OS that will work across everything (see windows 10, Unity, or KDE's current attempt at plasma across small devices..) which so far has been more hit than miss.

Given that these days we have very mobile and portable data it's easier to see computers, phones and all that other guff as simple terminals (with their displays and interfaces geared toward their use cases) but not to a particular server (your PC at home) but to your data.

Now you might be able to sell a PC/phone thing as a way of not buying two devices, but frankly the savings aren't there. I can buy a phone for 99 and a laptop for 199, both perfectly capable of fulfilling their roles and have way more computing power than a phone for 399 that compromises in both areas (likely on battery life or heat in its phone role, and performance in its desktop role), and you aren't saving anything...

That's not to say people shouldn't keep playing with this idea (like I said, I found it very interesting when I was playing around with it..) but I doubt it's going anywhere. </TEXT>

I was under the impression (and I might be wrong..) that the issue is pay for more hours because of the increased operational tempo with the model 3 production, but again, that might be wrong. I think it's also the case that the company was grown to accommodate the new work when Tesla bought the firm and so reached the point where there were enough employees to trigger the application of the collectively agreed wages.

<TEXT> Give me a single example outside of the EU. Well, maybe there are examples, I don't know, but only if there are similar common regulations involved as in the single market. You see, goods and people that are rightfully in one member state of the EU have the right to enter all other states.

Well. there's the common travel area that exists between the UK and Ireland (and predates the EU..), the  Nordic Passport Union also predates the EU, but if you'd like some other examples, there's Russia and Belarus, India and Nepal too, and lots of places with very weak border controls without the kind of integration the EU has too...

That's why Schengen works at all, the passport checks at the inner borders where useless by then anyway, for the individual exceptions Schengen introduced increased cooperation of the national authorities, border checks where delegated to the EU outer border. At the Schengen outer border, all you need to do is prove that you're an EU citizen.

Right.. but the UK and Ireland have external borders that are managed (by virtue of being an island) and cooperate on visas (as part of the CTA) outside of Schengen.  So if you arrive in the UK now, even though the UK and Ireland are not in Schengen, you can go to Ireland and the reverse is true too.

Schengen is about how you manage your borders, it shows that with the appropriate external controls you can do whatever you want with your internal borders, and it has nothing to do with free movement (a Chinese person can get a Schengen visa, but won't have the right to reside or work for example..). The same would be true in Ireland and the UK. It doesn't matter if a Canaidan national can cross the border into the UK, because they will have gone through an Irish airport anyway, same goes for an American entering Ireland from the UK.  In neither case would they have any special rights to work...

Outside of the EU, British goods and people have no automatic right to enter the EU, and the only way to be sure is to stop trucks at the border. Either to see what's in there or to check if the paper work says it's ok to enter. There is no other way to know what's in this truck.

Yeah.. So you use the various tools we have now to track consignments and containers between ports and trucks. Everything else is smuggling anyway, and we have to (and do..) deal with that already between the UK and Ireland and indeed between EU countries in Schengen.  The idea that you absolutely need a fence to stop it is a little archaic given we have goods that arrive from say Taiwan, go through the Netherlands and are then shipped to various places around the globe.

The agreements between the UK and Ireland will definitely have to be part of the Brexit negotiations, because Ireland can not ignore its obligations towards the EU, and the single market can not have a hole of the size of Ireland in its borders.

They don't have to ignore their obligations, they can meet them without a hard border.

<TEXT> Huge correlation between the two.

There is a correlation between people going to university, and people being smart. There is not a correlation between being smart and going to university, or rather that correlation weakens significantly as you go further back. It's not a small difference either, if you look at the numbers we've gone from 3.5 per 10k of population getting a first degree in 1950, compared to 65 per 10k of population in 2016. That compounds rather rapidly, and the  university admission numbers accelerated after 1997, it's not a gradual increase.

To put it another way, more people graduated in 2016 than did between 1950 and 1960... By a really large margin.

One begets the other. Take two people of the same intelligence, one goes to university and gets a job which involves a lot of thought and research. The other goes straight from school to a factory job. After forty years, the first one will be more intelligent than the second.

What if you take two people, one goes to university, the other does an apprenticeship, or trains as an accountant? The point is that university access has massively increased in the last few years. In isolation it is not a great data point, especially given that for a huge number of jobs, requirements for a degree are very recent too. Someone getting a computer science degree, or an English literature degree now isn't necessarily any more intelligent than someone who has spent the last 10 years as a programmer, or as a writer.  

The 'educated' numbers are skewed massively because we've entirely changed our approach to higher education.

If you take say social class as a guide, instead of age or level of education, it reduces the amount of skew by quite a bit:

AB went 59% for remain, C1 closer to 52% C2 went 62% for leave and DE 54% leave. So that C1 class is almost 50/50 split, even though it includes professionals and junior management..  In fact the DE grouping which would be your factory worker, (Semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers) were less likely to vote leave than skilled manual workers..

Compare that to the point about 70% of degree holders voting remain and 70% or those with no qualifications voting leave which seems to correlate far more closely with age (under 34 vs over 55's..) than with anything else..  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Schengen? really? I don't know what specific type of border you are thinking of ... I can not look inside your head, but I want to stress one last time: after the UK left the EU and the single market, as the standard option, there's going to be an EU outer border between Ireland and Norther Ireland.

There will be a border, in the same way that there currently is a border. A point where the UK ends and Ireland begins, where UK law applies, and where Irish law applies. What there won't be are checkpoints, a fence, or a major barrier.  The reasons for that are the agreements that the UK currently has with Ireland, the GFA, and because there is no need for one, the Irish and UK governments don't want one, and no-one can impose one..

 Then it is Ireland's duty to regulate all traffic of goods and people between that border to meet the rules of the single market.

Indeed, and the UK will want to regulate all traffic of goods and people too. Happily, that can be done without a hard border, as it is done elsewhere. And that is what the UK and Ireland will likely work to achieve, likely with the support of the EU..

You dived into a comment chain about the need for a hard border, there isn't going to be one. There will be a border, there will be customs and immigration processes, but there aren't going to be walls and checkpoints dividing the Island of Ireland. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha, I am just going to respond to this part, as it is the easiest: The UK-EU border is not an EU outer border at this point, there's freedom of movement of goods and people across that border. 

Yes.. but it is a border. The UK isn't in Schengen so there are passport controls and so on. The border exists in reality not just as an administrative boundary.

The EU/UK border right now is nothing like it will be after Brexit is finalized.

For the most part the border itself won't change, the customs process will and obviously immigration processes will too, and the rights people have one way or the other (Whether it's in terms of goods or people) will be different and managed differently. 

The only way that there is not going to be one of the three borders (EU/Ireland, Northern Ireland/Ireland, Northern Ireland/UK) is when the UK remains a full member of the single market, which is very unlikely, otherwise the UK would enjoy full freedom of movement as a non-EU-member. 

The UK is not going to be in the single market, but there is still no requirement for a hard border and no interest from those who would have to put one in place. Customs and immigration controls can be managed without a hard border, and likely will be between the UK and Ireland.

People going on about "not wanting a border" is not going to change a thing, this is a matter of international law.

What is a matter of 'international law'? As a country, you don't have to put in a border if you don't want to, you certainly don't have to put in place a particular type of border.  How you enforce your border and customs controls is down to the country in question.. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You are right, the union wanted a 30% wage rise considered industry standard and Tesla responded offering shares to workers betting on the fact that there will be another 10x increase in the next 5-10 years.

Until very recently Germany didn't have a minimum wage, instead it had minimum wages set by collective bargaining agreements instead. Now it has a mix (a federal minimum and the agreements, both enforceable by law). That's important to consider here. Germany does business in a very different way to a lot of countries and, as a result unions have quite a bit of clout (and they will have within anything Tesla does). Tesla can't really ignore that, you can't just offer shares instead, or some other benefit, you actually have to pay people.  What's more is that IG Metall is threatening strike action, which is something German unions do extremely rarely.

If you look at the German press (from say, 4 days ago), the issue that Grohmann has now is that it has more work than it has employees, and it can't hire people because it isn't pay the going rate. Moreover, there is a feeling that the push to set aside non-Tesla work, and essentially reduce the customer base is threatening the long term viability of Grohmann, that again doesn't really do anyone any favours in hiring (Germany being somewhere where people still generally look for a career with one employer, especially in this area).  That's compounded by Tesla's takeover of Grohmann having also led to the resignation of the founders of the company.. Essentially, the trust in the firm is, to a certain extent, shot.

Now the Tesla response is intended to head that off. Tesla are offering a raise, plus a share offer to  cover one half of the issues, and the promise of no redundancies over the next 5 years to suggest stability, but in not engaging with the union Musk is seen as making a major mistake in such a unionised area. It's worth noting that both the company works council and the union aren't happy with the offer and at the moment the issue seems to be that the offer of negotiations is being ignored by Tesla.

If you look at the statements by the union, the current issue around strike action is around the fact that it could harm Grohmann customers and employees given the wider situation. They seem keen to avoid it, but if Tesla don't negotiate, they don't seem to have a lot of options left, ignoring the company's own works council and the union aren't great ways to expand those options either..

<TEXT> Yeah believe what you want. 

I'll look at the situation and come to a conclusion based on what we know. You can do that, or you can believe what you want..

You will get a Free-trade agreement and still be asked for your thoughts on every matters in Brussels.

The UK will likely get an FTA, it won't be asked for it's thoughts on every matter that the EU discusses in Brussels... It will however have influence given that the UK and EU still want to work together on issues of mutual interest..

You just refuse to understand what everybody has been saying to you for the last 6 months. And even tho Merkel said it clearly 2 days ago : Britain is wasting time with Brexit delusions.

No.. I don't. It's clear that the UK will not have rights equal to those member states have once it leaves the European Union. To a certain extent the UK doesn't want to have equal rights as member states.  The UK doesn't want to be part of the political project, the current government is looking to take the UK out of the single market.. That's two big sets of 'rights' that the UK won't have.

What you seem to be doing is taking what Merkel is saying and utterly misunderstanding it. The UK won't have the same rights, or more rights in the context of the EU as an EU member, of course it won't. But it's not going away, it won't suddenly be irrelevant, especially in those areas where the UK is particularly capable and influential..  The UK is leaving the EU, not seceding from the world. If there are any delusions here, they are your suggestions that the UK won't have any influence in Europe, of course it will. It did before the EU existed and it will for a long time after it has left too.

And none of that is counter to what Merkel has said, whether you take the snippets reported in the media or listen to what she is saying in German in the context of EU and Germany domestic politics..

Older people were somewhat more likely to vote leave, so if you throw in that access to university has massively increased in recent years and so if you are younger you are *vastly* more likely to have had the opportunity to go to university, it becomes less a 'stupid' vs 'smart' and more a critique of access to tertiary education in the UK.

<TEXT> Each block has its own legislation on its ground.

And every country not in a trading block, or without a specific agreement where there is bilateral agreement... The UK will have to comply with EU rules and US rules, and Chinese rules etc.  And of course the EU, US and China will have to comply with UK rules.  We can put in place FTA's to reduce and remove barriers where it makes sense of course.

Yeah you're leaving the EU, not NATO so you're still supposed to contribute to it as you were. 

And the UK will, the point is that means you continue to have cooperation and coordination in areas that are important to the UK and EU.  That said, it won't be until the EU decides to go fully federal and combine it's defence (and there is still a lot of objection to that within the EU, even without the UK) that the takes a leading position in NATO. Until then the UK's position doesn't really change at all.  After all, the UK still has very deep defence ties with the US, above and beyond what other EU members have by quite a long way and that really doesn't look like it'll change. 

But other than that, the UK's influence in EU matters is over. You won't be able to block any kind of European Task Force, of services integrations and all the others things the UK was stalling for the last decade.

Yeah, or course. The UK is leaving. It won't be able to block anything that the EU agrees to do. On the other side of that, the UK also won't be taking part in them or contributing financially either. That's the point of leaving.. But the UK isn't the only party that has been less than enthusiastic, the UK leaving doesn't solve the problems the EU has in areas where it requires unanimity, it simply reduces the opposition.

Why would the EU cares about the UK once it's out? 

Because it's still the largest non-EU regional power in Europe and that's relevant to the EU?

What the EU become is no longer your concern really.

Of course it is, it's still relevant to the UK's interests, and the UK is relevant to the EU's interests.  The UK will be outside of the EU, it won't be part of the political project, but it will still be a major trading partner, a defence partner and of course another country that the EU will want to work with as much as the UK wants to work with it..  From everything from trade, to trade sanctions, the UK is pretty relevant to the EU (as the EU is to the UK..).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> France and Germany have now more power than ever to go wherever they want to go from now on.

France and Germany now have the power to cooperate with 25 other nations in some areas of competency. The EU isn't some German-Franco empire and as we have seen time and time again, both France and Germany only have so much leverage across the EU.  The UK will be the largest regional power that isn't part of the EU, arguably the single largest regional power bar the EU if you consider, military, economic and social factors together.

That alone will mean that the EU will be interested.

In the end, you'll have zero MPs in Brussels and you will be put aside of all Europeans projects.

The whole point is to have zero MEPs in Brussels, leaving the political project is basically the whole aim. But that doesn't mean that the UK will have zero influence.

As to projects, sure the UK will leave many the EU ones, not so much the European ones but it'll likely depend on which projects. I'm sure the UK will still participate in some (there are plenty of non-EU countries involved in quite a few of those projects after all).

You won't have a say in any of the EU legislation that you will still have to comply in order to do business with the EU.

We will only have to comply with some EU legislation, in much the same way that Germany has to comply with US legislation when it deals with the US, or France has to comply with Brazilian legislation when it deals with Brazil.  The UK isn't going to turn into Norway, or Switzerland, where the EU can legislate on issues that are broadly domestic..

But yeah, for the camera and shit : "great, deep, respectfull, Mickey Mouse cooperation". Right. Delusion much.

The UK has a slew of non-EU bilateral cooperation agreements in areas not covered by the EU competencies with EU states now. The EU is keen to keep the UK on board for policing, intelligence and a range of other issues, the UK will continue to cooperate via NATO and various other frameworks..  So no, it's not delusion.  </TEXT>

There is going to be a border in the same way that there is a border now between the UK and the EU generally, between the UK and Ireland there is almost no chance of being a hard border though. None of the parties involved want one, and there are other ways to deal with the movement of goods etc..

That there is no border at all and British goods and people can just pass into the EU, as if it was still a member, is not an option.

You do realise that just crossing a border is just one part of importing something, or emigrating..? There are lots of ways to track goods, and manage people crossing a border, especially when you are talking about the border on an Island.

The EU doesn't want a border, the UK doesn't, and Ireland doesn't. No-one can impose one on the UK and Ireland either so.. There isn't likely to be a border. </TEXT>

Of course we do. The UK doesn't want to be part of the EU's political project, but we still have an interest in ensuring that the EU is stable, both economically and socially.  That's before we get into things like defence cooperation through NATO and bilaterally and all the other little things that we work together on as a group of nations (often well beyond the EU).

there will have zero voice for the UK in Brussels and all the drama will be over.

The UK won't be part of the EU, it's not going into seclusion. The UK will have diplomatic representation in the EU in much the same way that the EU will have in the UK, and no doubt there are lots of areas where our cooperation will be both broad and deep.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah well you're not saying anything but random drunkar babbling. 

It may be that your lack of understanding as to how the EU works, and where the balance is between the EP and members is leaving you a little confused.

The EU is a democratic Union where each country has Mps depending on the number of their population.

Right.. But the European Parliament (Where those MEP's sit) can only act within the competencies granted to it by the member states, via the treaties. If you want to extend those, you need agreement from the member states, the level of agreement required depends on the kind of extension. You can't 'force' a member state to agree to hand over competencies, and you can't introduce legislation on some matters without the consent of member states.

You're trying to play the "let's divide them" when you obviouly couldn't care less about the Netherlands. I mean, you don't even care about N.I. or Scotland's vote why would you care about a foreign country.

Not at all. I'm saying that where previously the UK has worked with the likes of the Netherlands on a common interest within the EU, the UK leaving only weakens the dissenting view, it doesn't eliminate it. And of course in some areas, a single dissenting voice is enough to prevent further action (although there is always enhanced cooperation available to those states that want to make use of it).

I would be concerned however if the EU could force through an expansion or major reform of it's institutions without consent, that would be a bad thing for all involved, which I'm sure you'd agree.  After all, the EU is a grouping of sovereign states, not a federation.

IDK if the Brexit makes you brits petty or if you were already petty and that made you vote for it.

I honestly don't see what you see as petty here, I hope the EU does manage to carry out the reform and integration that it wants. It would be beneficial for the region and provide stability. I'd rather not see that forced on members who don't want it though, and happily in many areas that isn't possible anyway, so the EU will have to continue to form a consensus.

Surely that's a good thing all round, rather than your suggestion that the EU could simply force the Netherlands or Ireland to accede to whatever demands are made because they are too small to protect their interests.  </TEXT>

Probably (and hopefuly) yes.

The EU still needs reform, without the UK it might be able to carry out more of that reform (maybe not, the UK wasn't alone in opposition, and treaty change still requires unanimity..) but the UK's exit won't fix the issues on its own, and it will introduce some minor new issues, especially amongst the other member states who worked with the UK and have positions closer to that of the UK than say France and Germany.

Partly true, partly not. The argument is that the bigger her majority, the less internal opposition she has to deal with, and the less leverage the EU has in using the UK's own domestic opposition to undermine the negotiating position of the government.

So, arguably it is true, but for anyone who doesn't want the government to be able to act essentially unilaterally, that obviously isn't a good thing.

<TEXT> Actually, just from that article she sounds fairly reasonable. Even the drug courier (and I suppose benefit fraud..) bits aren't net negatives. People make stupid decisions when they need money, she did, apparently recognised it and managed to salvage the positives, combine that with leaving home at 16 and she does come across as someone who has faced a few challenges and overcome them, not perfectly, but hey. That's not a bad thing.  Granted she went on to start and drop out of a few courses, but seems to have finished teacher training at college.

So, going purely on this one article, given its student politics, she seems more normal than many of the people you hear about. That probably does make her a representative NUS president.

<TEXT> Had something similar (almost) happen a year and a bit ago when I was running a little stall where we were giving away random merch to people we were speaking to, all on behalf of a tiny community advocacy group, at a civil liberties convention (think small, a few speakers, a few workshops and maybe 1000 people). The stall had the usual stuff, pens, posters, mugs, wrist bands, caps, small USB sticks and some T-shirts IIRC and lots of brochures style information for people to get a better idea of what the group did and so on. 

There were about three of us chatting to people, getting contact details, some donations, and I think there was a petition involved, but that may have been a different event.. Anyway, our little table was covered in promotional material, we'd been at it for a few hours but the event was still quite busy, all in all a good day. 

As I'm talking to a guy I see a woman walk over pick up one of the leaflets and read though it, so as I finish I pop over to her and ask if there is anything she'd like to know or if she's happy reading and she stops, looks up and asks how much our mugs are. 

Now normally people would ask about a specific thing in the leaflets, or ask about the stuff that the group did, occasionally they'd ask for a specific one of the posters or similar but I don't think anyone had asked about pricing for the bits we were giving away.  I replied with something along the lines of 'oh, those? we aren't selling them, were giving them away to people who are interested!' and I hand her a mug. She pops it in her bag and goes back to reading.

At that point I step away and let her read, there was another guy who wanted to chat about something and she seemed more interested in the literature so I let her get on with it.  About two minutes later I look across the table again and she's putting all of the mugs we've got on the table in her bag. 

Now it wasn't a small amount, I think about a dozen, maybe a few more, full sized coffee mugs in a variety of colours. I was a tiny bit taken aback so I sort of watched in fascination for maybe 15 seconds as she tries to pack these mugs into a bag that's already basically full of them..  10 seconds in she bends down and grabs the box of extra mugs that we have sat under the table (maybe another 10-12 mugs..) and starts to try and arrange the mugs she can't get into her handbag into the box..

At that point I went over again and asked her what she was doing and the conversation wend something like:

Me:  Excuse me, you can't take all of those..

Her: Why? You said they were free!?

Me: I said we were giving them away to people.. But if you take them all we won't have any left to give. 

Her: If they are free then I can take them, you can't stop me if they don't cost anything.

Me: ... No, we are giving them away, we aren't letting anyone take as many of them as they'd like.

Her (sounding really quite indignant): Well I don't see the difference and you said they were free. 

Me: The difference is that I haven't said you can have all of those. Could you put them back please?

Her: I don't see why I should..

And she puts the box on the table, takes maybe 3 of the many mugs she's stuffed in her bag onto the table and stalks off.  I'm half bemused, half annoyed and entirely bemused about the whole thing but hey, stuff happens.

About 15 minutes later one of the event organisers, looking a bit confused, collars me and asks what had happened. Apparently she'd tried to complain to one of their event staff that we were engaged in false advertising by saying we were giving away mugs for free and then not letting her take as many as she needed.  Apparently she felt that she was entitled to some money for her trouble, in part because she'd had to leave around 20 mugs that she valued at at least 1 a piece behind due to our actions.. Needless to say she didn't get any (never mind anything else, it was a free event..) and apparently left in a bit of a huff.

edit: *TLDR: Woman tries to take all the mugs being given away by a community group at a civil liberties event, gets told no, leaves in a huff.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is the school of thought that above all else, the money is best in my pocket. It might look mildly better on the balance sheet, it might give you a good buzz but in terms of relationships its shite.  I've worked for small organisations in the past where I've taken the approach of paying suppliers in full, as early as is reasonable (essentially pay on invoice, rather than sitting on it). Oddly enough you end up with decent relationships, more room to talk about discounts, you can get things done that you can't where you don't have that relationship (especially getting people to rush a job for you..). Almost inevitably at some point or another down the line, someone decides that paying suppliers in 30 days, or 90 days is better, often trying to haggle at that point for additional discount... Then I inevitably get a call from someone at the company asking if they know why X supplier is suddenly not offering them the same discounts, or how I got Y supplier to provide something in 72 hours without a huge markup instead of the usual 7 days and whether I'd talk to them (the answer to which is.. no, your relationship, if you've screwed it up I'm not putting mine on the line..).

It's daft. Goodwill is valuable, yes there are at times good reasons to hold payment, but be up front about it, and if you have the service or product and it's right, and you have the agreed price, pay it. Keeping the cash on your books for an extra month or two really isn't worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is: Islam. Atatrk managed to make a democratic state, how well is that working out?

Indonesia? Egypt managed for a while too.. If you have a state set up to separate religion from political power it's entirely possible. If you can go from Nazism to democracy, you can have democracy in a Muslim majority country.

Nope, I don't care. We have a moral responsibility to not piss away what took generations to build. 

The generations that built that were the ones who thought these issues were important.  The whole point of the refugee conventions was to prevent the horrors that very mobile European and Jewish people (amongst others) experienced after all. Of course your values are entirely up to you, I just don't see them as justifiable, or the threat that you present as credible.

Yes it is. It's clear as day that continuing current policies will end in civil war.

No, it's not.

I'm moving to the US for this reason

Good luck with that.

So it is true. Glad I was able to correct that misconception.

What misconception? You suggested that migrants get more than nationals, they don't they get nothing, refugees (a smaller subset of the people who have moved to Europe) get the same at most, if their claims are valid.. That's not a correction, that's a changing of the goalposts.

This is a completely irrational feelz based policy. 

Yes, you are right, suggesting that maybe not pulling people out of the sea when made aware that they are drowning is just me being a woolly bleeding heart, it's all about he feelz...

More people die because you're giving them an incentive to take the risk.

So turn them around after pulling them out of the sea. The point is that letting them die doesn't equate to granting them residency and giving them a house.

t's neither. It's rational. Your policy prescriptions are daft and immoral because not only do more people die at sea, you will also piss away all the progress attained by pushing Europe into civil war. 

Europe is not going to enter into a civil war though is it? I mean.. come on...

Now, I realise that most people are stupid and will continue to vote for idiots until it is too late, which is why I'm out.

See, what I don't get is how, if you think Europe is heading toward civil war, you think the US is somehow a safer option.. But hey.

<TEXT> He was confident of a remain victory which looking at the polls even at the time he shouldn't have been. The main reason that it happened was because of in fighting within his party and not because of the public demand. Having high public support was just a bonus.


I think he was excessively confident, but as you point out, the decision was necessary because of the issues it was causing him, even within his own party, and because other parties (including the Lib Dems) were using as a stick to beat him, and of course there was public demand too.  That does suggest it was the right decision though.  He may have been unhappy with the outcome, but the reasons for holding the referendum remain fairly sensible.

I think that it was, referendums are seldomly ever a good idea and there wasn't that much consideration put into it, in order to make it as reflective as possible. Referendums debatably show the public mood at the time so if people change their mind it is pretty hard to do the changes that have been done.

I'd somewhat agree with you. I think they are only sensible on matters of governance (so independence, changing voting systems, significant treaties with political implications etc..), that's why they are so rare. EU membership however does seem to fall into that category, and a very clear question, which again, the EU referendum had, is the right approach.

I can't speak for anyone else but I didn't support it as long as it was announced. 

No, but you would have been in a minority in the UK.

Referendums tend to be or at least were quite popular in general it just was that this one was more in the limelight. Having an EU referendum is pretty popular in other EU countries as well, 53% of French people support having a referendum on the EU, while only 33% of them want to leave, both articles are in French BTW.

And that goes for most referendums, people want a say, it doesn't mean that they all want the same result. That's perfectly reasonable. You have to take into account that not only was there support in the polls for a referendum, but also support in Parliament (The commons voted 544 to 53 in favour of holding a referendum, those 53 nays all coming from the SNP..).

Yes there was.

What exactly? People wanted a referendum, the government wanted a referendum, the opposition voted for a referendum, even the Lib Dems did. The issue doesn't seem to be that there are regrets that a referendum was held, but that a referendum was held and that remain lost.

It made existing divisions even deeper, referendums by its very nature are divisive. They force people to take sides on an issue, especially an issue as complex as the the EU.

It made some people take sides for the vote, but it broadly illuminated an existing split. The UK didn't suddenly become vastly more divided as a people, although as people informed themselves they took positions for and against a political question. Then we had the result, and the country is broadly coalescing around that, and no doubt with the focus shifting on the how, rather than the if, that will continue.

It didn't happen by accident or because culturally the British are opposed to the EU. If there is going to be constant negative reporting of something. Don't be surprised that the public have a negative opinion of it. Many of their problems aren't caused by the EU as such they are still going to be unhappy after it has happened.

Except that the UK has been, generally, very lukewarm on the EU since joining. There is vastly less support for the political project. We can try to make out that this is all a media conspiracy, but that really doesn't make a huge amount of sense, there have been long standing political divisions, opposition to various aspects of the EU and negative media reporting.. If anything, the result of the referendum shows that a significant fraction of the population, across party lines, were perfectly able to balance their priorities and come to a very different view from the remainder. 

It's easier to blame the media than it is to look at why people might reject the EU, I understand that, but it doesn't give a full picture at all.

You don't know what exactly will happen in the future. The referendum in 1975 was more clear cut than the last one yet a small minority campaigned to leave, until they could convince a small majority to vote that way. Most people got on their lives for those 40 odd years, yet it still happened.

Of course not, but joining the EU now is very different than joining the EEC in 1973, many of the things that the UK had opt outs on likely wouldn't be opt-outable of so you'd not only have to convince people that EU membership was the right move, but also defend against the suggestion that the UK would lose the pound, have to join Schengen and potentially a whole raft of other things that are genuinely unpopular in the UK (like an EU Army etc..).  Not to mention that they'd have to convince the EU that they should take the UK as a member.

Maybe in 40 years things will change, but I seriously doubt it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Credit = popular awareness = willingness to fund (in democratic state).

Right... But ESA can promote itself too, just because NASA claimed credit for something doesn't mean ESA has to shut up and say nothing.  And again, is stopping cooperation with NASA a reasonable response?

From your own country (with the british flag), I bet there wasn't a lot of popular awareness about what the EU actually did for the U.K. and now you have the brexit predicament thanks to it. 

I'd argue that there was quite a bit of awareness of what the EU did, just that a small majority of people felt that it wasn't worth the downsides of membership, or the compromises involved. That has very little to do with credit going to the EU, and everything to do with what people think of things that actually were, largely, down to EU membership.

We don't want people to vote away funding for space exploration and leave it all to Trump and Putin.

Right, so ESA needs to promote what it does, ending cooperation with NASA which is what the parent proposed doesn't exactly deal with that in the first place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thatcher was similar, she tended to avoid public confrontation. And we all remember this

It's a classic failure to communicate what 'danger to our ships' means, followed by some quite dismissing comments that just don't come across terribly well.  Take this particular argument, the course of the Belgrano is public now (not sure if it was at the time) and it clearly wasn't 'sailing away' but rather loitering outside of the exclusion zone and changing heading somewhat regularly (although not directly into the exclusion zone AFAIKT).  The questioner does a wonderful job of repeating 'sailing away' and Thatcher fails to properly respond to that specific accusation and essentially argues that she knows better so that should be enough.

<TEXT> I would be surprised if he shows regret for what was such a terrible decision.

It was a decision that led to a result that went against his expectations, but it wasn't a terrible decision in and of itself. Having a referendum on EU membership was entirely reasonable and popular (Even among people who later voted remain). The outcome is also not terrible, it might turn out to be, I doubt it, but it certainly isn't yet and doesn't look like it will be.

I can understand him regretting the campaign, regretting the approach to the referendum even regretting standing down when he did, but there is little to regret in deciding to hold the referendum in the first place.

It didn't have to poison British politics but was escalated in such a way that it did and the referendum didn't put it to bed. If anything it created even deeper divisions.

It hasn't created deeper divisions, it has illuminated divisions that were already there, and kicked off a process that will likely heal them to a large extent.  Being in the EU was a sore spot for a lot of people for a long time, one that got rubbed every time anything they didn't like happened, being outside of the EU isn't going to have the same impact on those who voted remain even if only because being outside of the EU will not be as visible as being in it is.

Give it a few years and the current remain/leave split will disappear, a small minority will no doubt campaign to join the EU, but it will be a very small minority, most people will just get on with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One useful thing that national debates do is force every party to present a single, consistent vision for governance to the people.

That's true, but it also backfires when they present something that they can't back up with the rest of their party, and generally they don't get called out on it if it is their view.

In regular campaigning the party candidate for Clacton can be giving one kind of spin to his constituents whilst the party candidate for Kensington can be telling a completely different lie. 

And in the real world, the party candidate for Clacton can take a completely different view and promote different issues than the party candidate for Kensington. That's sort of my point, my MP is anti-nuclear weapons, his party has a pro-nuclear weapons policy but the party leader is anti-nuclear weapons. If positions on nuclear weapons were incredibly important to me in terms of my vote (and they are to some extent) how do the debates help me figure out what that mess means? More to the point, someone who doesn't know what their MPs position is, or the party position, may not get the best position from a televised debate, especially if where a leader and party differ, or an issue is controversial, they do the usual thing of giving vague replies.

The debates are one of the few ways in which we can force parties to sell everybody the same deal, not tailored deceptions.

Indeed, but manifesto documents do it just as effectively which removes the issue of personalities and whether you like the look or sound of someone.

 It doesn't stop them lying to us, but it at least limits them to one lie on each issue, and one that can be publicly fact checked by the broadcaster.

Hold on, it doesn't limit them to one lie each either, they still get to send out different material in each constituency and campaign differently in different areas.. About all it does is ensure they have a nice generic country wide argument that they can use as a backdrop too.

Sure the debates shouldn't be the only thing we judge our votes on (and they aren't!) but they are definitely a useful anchor as we attempt to process all the bullshit.

Yeah, I think candidate debates are but that leaders debates create more skew than they eliminate, and that's before we get into the candidates and parties that aren't represented at all in them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's certainly one part of it, but he has also taken positions that much of the Party doesn't necessarily stand for and failed to bring the party along (which comes back to the PLP to some degree).  It feels like as leader, he has placed electoral success behind an ideological position that is less popular, and so hasn't been able to show support from the middle ground, which in turn has caused problems for the PLP, many of whose voters fall into that middle ground.

It comes back to the notion that in an FPTP world, the Labour party, like the Tory part is essentially a large coalition. Corbyn hasn't been able to bring all of those factions into line behind him, and it's costing him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We're talking EU here. 

We are talking about elected assemblies that include people who don't support their countries or regions membership in the entity that the assembly is part of.  So in the case of UKIP and the EP, they don't want the UK in the EU, but are representing people in an EU body, and the SNP don't want Scotland in the UK, but are representing people in a UK body.

 I don't see a parallel to Scotlands goal to get rid of Westminster domination.

Scotland wanting to leave the UK, is, on the face of it similar to the UK wanting to leave the EU. The SNP and UKIP both want the bit of what they represent not to be part of the larger body that they have elected seats in the parliaments of..

Apparently, Westminster seems to be ok with Brexit while at the same time holding on to Scotland. How does that fit into your narrative?

I really don't see how it is relevant.. Westminster is OK with Brexit and authorised a Scottish independence referendum a couple of years ago and will no doubt do so again in the not so distant future. Last I checked there hasn't been a unilateral independence declaration from Scotland, or indeed a majority supporting independence, so at the moment Scotland is very much still voluntarily part of the UK, as it has essentially always been. But what does that have to do with Some MP's in Westminster wanting an Independent Scotland? or MEPs not wanting their member state to be part of the EU?

The point is that you can be elected to a body even if you don't want that body to exist, there is nothing particularly wrong with that, after all, if you are elected, it would seem quite a few other people agree with your view too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The tories never shy away from saying how terrible everything WOULD be if labour were in charge, but for some reason labour don't seem that focused on how terrible things ARE. I normally disagree with this approach but I think swathes of the general public are so accepting of the offered scapegoats that they don't realise (or choose to ignore) there are people making decisions that are leading to all the issues around them.

Frankly I'm a bit sick of this from both sides, I'd much rather have some positive messaging (and not just 'we will defeat *bad thing*') but hey, we'll see if that is even possible in this election. 

So many people have such huge problems with Corbyn that at this point they should put at least some time into the 'better of two evils' approach. Sadly I'm not sure Corbyn has the self-awareness to really grasp this somehow.

<TEXT> idk, Corbyn has seemed much stronger than May to me recently.

To be honest, he's always seemed principled and and strong on his positions and priorities. The problem for me is that I agree with about half of them and have real issues with the other half. 

Now, a lot of the Labour policy discussions that have been had have been broadly positive, but it doesn't always feel like Corbyn is entirely interested in them (based on what comes out of the party and social media as much as anything else), and on the areas where I support the party position essentially in apparent opposition to Corbyn there are real problems. The two don't balance each other out nicely either. So at that point, as a Labour member the message is horribly mixed, for the average person I can imagine it's a bit worse...

 but I think putting them next to each other in a situation other than PMQs could have some real impact on people's view of May.

Honestly I don't think even electorally, ignoring anything else, that would be helpful. The worst possible thing would be the expectations of May being dropped as far as they are now, and then having a debate that gives Corbyn the opportunity to say something stupid, probably in opposition to the party, likely on an issue lots of people care about, and likely in a way that he then ends up trying to roll back...

Because really it's bloody terrifying that her government might be given such a huge majority at such an important time.

It really, really is.

Ha, I'd like Labour to do well in this election, so I'm honestly not sure if they should. Although at least if they do get some, then maybe we avoid the after election struggle of whether we should continue down the current route regardless of electoral results, or find something that actually works..

and I agree entirely that we shouldn't be focused on the leaders so much, it's really terrible. I would probably prefer politics to be entirely anonymous and purely policy led but the problems with that obviously make it a ridiculous idea.

<TEXT> I'd say that the point here is that "nation has not spoken" by any means.

It has 'spoken' in so far as it speaks on anything. The whole point of holding a referendum was because it was an issue that crossed party lines, where there was discontent and Parliament wanted guidance from the electorate. They got it...

And with the tight results of the public consultation (with no legal value) the only out-come should be thorough parliamentary debate possibly followed by election where the politicians would present their program regarding the brexit - so the new parliament would get the mandate to go further.

Why? I mean, apart from the fact that there was parliamentary debate, and a parliamentary vote based on the public consultation (the UK is leaving because Parliament allowed the PM to trigger A50, not directly because of the referendum...) and of course there will be a general election now too. 
 An election which will almost certainly return a massive majority for the Government, and even if it didn't, the opposition parties are all also supporting the view that the UK should now leave the EU.

Finally the adoption of measures of the constitutional magnitude (as invoking art 50) should follow the UK constitution

They do, in so far as the UK constitution and conventions exist. We even had a supreme court decision on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly don't think they do. If you think back to the various elections before TV debates, there was an element (especially with Blair) of it, but it was less than the 'Clegg' factor in 2010 or massive focus on the likes of Farage and Bennet in 2015. If you go back a little further it becomes even less pronounced and you see groups of 'leading' people from the parties as more important. Fewer people attend hustings too of course, and campaign material has become more and more focused on national and leadership figures than local issues and candidates..  But I'd argue the TV debates solidified that and took it even further. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But the bigger issue is the media. 

No, it's not. The bigger problem is that Corbyn and the party are both doing a really bad job when it comes to the media. The party are in a position where even when there are successes to be had, they aren't being properly presented, it's an absolute shit show in that regard. The print media isn't neutral in the UK, it has never been but the last few years have been particularly bad (and Ed had similar issues, albeit not to the same degree, so did Brown for that matter). It's not as though Cameron didn't have issues with the media either, the difference was the level of competence shown in managing narratives and presenting things.

Now I get that Corbyn wanted to do things differently, but he failed miserably in that regard, even a lot of the Labour/Corbyn social media efforts are incredibly poor. You can't simply shift the blame to the media.

As to Ed, he was presented as less electable, but the Miliband Labour party  was nowhere near the territory that the party under Corbyn is in now.

<TEXT> it's true that it doesn't fit, but it's also the case that a great deal of people don't have problems with Corbyn's policies but some notion that he is a weak personality.

Right, but if we were a little less focused on presidential style debates and personality that might matter less. The team around Corbyn have been focusing everything on him, rather than Labour as a part for a long time now, and unfortunately that really hasn't helped. May isn't seen in isolation in the same way, that means that even through she isn't a great speaker, she is seen as being able to manage and that's more where the whole notion of 'good PM/bad PM' material seems to come from. If we were dealing with that on both sides, things might be a little better.

that too doesn't fit, and a TV debate can show the people that make these judgements that they shouldn't eat up everything the press gives them. not everyone has an active interest in politics, but many of them still vote.

I'm honestly not sure that a TV debate would change the views people have of Corbyn because it's not filtered through the media in some other way.. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It appears the public are more interested in how well our PM speaks so why not watch them do that at a time people can tune in? 

Because it reduces the election campaign to a contest between two people which it isn't. We end up electing people on the basis that they are slightly more likeable than the other chap whilst feeling well informed, when it turns out that the person we actually elect is potentially very different, and that maybe the TV debates don't cover enough to actually make a sensible decision. Or, as someone said elsewhere, for existing party supporters, it's basically an opportunity to cheer someone on.

If they want to do televised debates then fine, lets have debates,but every candidate in the GE should have the opportunity to take part in one, we have local TV channels, we could make that happen... It'd be far more useful than what we've seen in the past in terms of TV debates. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, and even then I doubt it would work as it did in Germany. The culture has no experience with democracy, you have the "kaffirs on muslim land" problem, and so on.

Germany didn't exactly have a long period of actual democracy before WWII either, and had a tiny problem with varying ethnicities if memory serves.  There is no good reason to suggest that a democratic state is not possible in Middle eastern states...

We don't need to separate these groups. Europe has taken in enough refugees for the next 10 years at least. 

Yeah, we do, because refugees move on the basis of need, which makes them significantly different from people migrating for any other reason. There isn't some sort of arbitrary limit at which point our moral responsibilities, based on our own value systems simply cease to exist.

The criterion for admission should be based on one factor alone: is it beneficial for Europe to allow this person in.

For migration I'd agree with you. For asylum the factor should be risk.

Continuing to let in millions per year is going to end in civil war.

No, it's not. However it is unsustainable, but then how many of the people entering Europe are refugees?

False again. Germany and the UK give refugees full welfare benefits, and Sweden, Canada, Netherlands are other examples. Most countries do this, in fact. Most countries also allow refugees to work.


See, this is where the difference between migrant and refugee is important again. Your initial statement, in relation to migrants generally was:

They often get more than citizens on welfare

That isn't true. In the UK, asylum seekers get very little support [see here](https://www.gov.uk/asylum-support/what-youll-get) until their asylum claim is complete, when their asylum claim is complete they get the same access to the welfare state as anyone else in the same situation, not more, and it will take anything up to 6 months to get a decision on your status. If you are not an asylum seeker, but a migrant without a valid visa or similar, or if your asylum application isn't approved, you have no access to the welfare state.

Are you aware of Europe's history? 

Yes... Some of it isn't too pretty, hence why countries in Europe pushed protections of refugees and international frameworks that mandate support.

Nor should it be part of Europe's values to save idiots who do stupid things all over the world, which then gives many more people the incentive to do the same stupid thing.

Is anyone suggesting that? 

I do not advocate for repatriation of migrants. I only advocate for stopping the inflow so we actually have a chance to integrate those already here.

And I'd advocate for the repatriation of migrants that don't have a valid claim through the immigration system, as well as failed asylum seekers, where it is possible. On the other side of that, I think not letting people drown in the sea is generally a good idea, and for those who make it to Europe they should be able to go through a process to determine whether they are entitled to support as a refugee or not..

You seem keener to see people, including people who really are fleeing for their lives die and just let anyone who has made it so far to remain under whatever circumstances.. That seems really daft and incredibly amoral.

I should set the scene a little though, the evening before, by the light of the moon (and some way into the morning if memory serves), we had dug ourselves a nice.. well, it was a trench by the time people were happy, in some wonderfully luminous chalk.  It was beautiful, you could see us (covered in chalk dust) and the position for miles until we got it properly covered and got everyone cleaned up again, like angels in the night, gorgeous, you'd have loved it. 

Now half the reason we ended up digging for so long was that we had a rather tall member of the section, and one rather short member, so to accommodate both comfortably some beautiful person suggested that we take that into consideration in our nocturnal excavations. 

Then, early in the morning the word came down, collect in your trip flares and be prepared to move off a little before dawn. That is so considerate when you think about it, you get a chance to appreciate the ice that has formed on your shemagh and that crisp feeling your bivvy bag has in those early hours, not to mention that you'll see a glorious sunrise, behind you, through a thin veil of smoke.  Glorious.

Anyway, after completing our morning enjoyments, we were informed that one of our number had fainted from the beauty of it all, and would need to be carried aloft in an improvised manner, to a destination that was beyond a small, picturesque and no doubt snow fed and crystal clear stream.  Happily it was our second stoutest member who was prone, so we knew it wouldn't require much exertion on our part, and yes, whilst his kit was inexplicably heavier than expected, our morale and spirits were high as we set off.

It was only once we had borne him aloft that we realised the fatal flaw in our endeavours. Trying to carry a svelte 16 stone beauty on an creatively improvised stretcher, when you have a nimble 4ft2 hobbit on one corner, and a sturdy 6ft6 Adonis  on another requires careful consideration of inclines and stride length to avoid calamity.  Coordination that is sometimes  a tad lacking after no sleep and a little physical exertion.. 

Oh and it also turns out if you drop the 16 stone bloke onto the 4ft2 chap whilst trying to crossing a freezing river, your mock casevac can almost turn into a real one.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think this can work. We can occupy one or maybe two countries, and there would already be difficulties as there were in Iraq. We cannot occupy half the world. It would also fuel "muh kaffirs on muslim lands" and given the muslim population in Europe that wouldn't end well. It would need to be a 50+ year occupation before the country could stand on its own, and I don't think 50 years is even enough.

I'm not suggesting that we occupy anyone, but rather that had we approached the invasion of Iraq more like the liberation of Germany and Japan after WWII it might not have been such a disaster afterwards, although it would have involved a massive occupation. 

And we could absolutely have done so, it'd have cost a massive amount, involved massive numbers of soldiers, probably a draft etc.. 

For migration the solution is easy. Stop giving lifelong handouts and stop people at the border.

For migration that isn't related to asylum that's broadly right. For asylum, where people are actively fleeing war it is somewhat different.

Did they join a terrorist group? Libya was 1000x better under Gaddafi than now, unless you're part of a terrorist group.

No, one was a civil engineer, I think he's dead now. They went back because they left after having issues with the regime, so I suppose for them specifically it wasn't possible to live in Libya whilst Gaddafi was in power, and they hoped and wanted to make the country better once he had gone. Clearly that didn't happen.

Nonsense. They travel through 15 safe countries for a reason. They even risk their life on a boat in order to go from one safe country to a richer safe country.

Some do, some do less.  You have migrants from all over the place (some that are from safe countries in the first place) mixed in with people who are refugees and from very much not safe countries. The latter (taking the central, and eastern Mediterranean routes are passing through countries like Turkey, Egypt and Libya to get to Europe. I think we need to separate people fleeing from war, from people who are simply looking for a better country to live in though, economic migration and refugees are different problems at the end of the day, and whether you can stay in Europe does depend heavily where you fall between those groups.

Blatantly false. In most countries the refugees get into the same welfare programs as citizens, plus extras.

Which ones? Last I looked it was quite a lot less, Germany and the UK certainly do (and they are usually pointed at as being generous..). I'm also reasonably sure that refugees generally don't qualify for the same welfare programmes and depending on country, many are not allowed to work either.

Nope, let people die if they are stupid enough to get on a boat. This will much reduce the total number of deaths in the long term.

I doubt it'd reduce the number of deaths, but it simply letting some proportion of people drown in the sea absolutely would be a reversal of centuries of tradition and values on the side of Europe. It doesn't fit into the 'European values' thing, the 'Christian values' thing, or even the western values thing really does it?  I mean sure, advocate for removal and repatriation for migrants and camps for refugees with the intention of later return, protect borders etc.. that all just about fits, but let people die when we could help? Doesn't sound right to me, maybe I don't know the right people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair, speeding fines bring in less money than the budget's allocated to the traffic police by a fairly large margin, so I'm not sure how much the money is actually a driver for government, it's something like 80p per person across the whole country per year at the moment, and this change is hardly going to drive it up (especially if it stops a few people speeding too..), it's 30x less than say Air passenger duty for example, and (as people point out) it's entirely avoidable.

It's also worth noting that the fines and points are bigger on slower roads. 20mph over in a 30 will net you 6 points or a 28 day disqualification, and 75-125% of your weekly pay, whilst 20mph over on the motorway will get you 3 points and a fine of 25-75% of weekly pay.  Which seems somewhat sensible in context (although again, I think there should be some thought on whether 70 is a reasonable limit..).

The bigger issue really is whether it reduces speeding, and whether trying to reduce speeding on roads like motorways is a good idea or whether there should be changes to the limits instead.

It's probably also relevant that the police will also treat speeding differently, you are far less likely to end up with a dangerous driving charge for driving too fast on the motorway than if you were driving far too fast on some other road.

Given that both end up on your license for roughly the same amount of time, I'd be willing to bet that they'd be treated fairly similarly to be honest. I'd assume it'd have the same impact on their risk assessments (as it's the same risk..) at which point it'd depend on your insurer.

<TEXT> The biggest issue with our motorways isn't speed, it's lane discipline and following distance.

Yeah, agreed on that.. On Tuesday this week I was in the right hand lane behind (I think it was a Qashqai btw..) a car that was slowly, as in 67, maybe, overtaking a lorry.  Some tit in a Merc 4x4 decided I wasn't going quickly enough, undertook me, realised the lorry was going slower than they'd anticipated and then dived into my stopping space with maybe 5m clearance between me, and indeed the lorry..  Of course he then had to brake hard to avoid rear-ending the car in front (leaving me to slam my brakes on, happily with room behind as he'd vacated the space..).  It's utterly insane, leaving a reasonable stopping distance seems to be taken by some as an invitation to dive into it, and moving back into the middle or right hand lane seems to be a real problem for a lot of drivers (although I have been guilty of 'notional' lane changes on the motorway when I've had nothing behind me and I can see I'm going to have to pull out again in a few minutes..).

 Germany is generally much better for this, and I've driven on the Autobahn with cars doing 200kmh+ and it seems to flow much better than most UK motorways, and most drivers seem to keep a good distance.

It can be, around the cities it can be just as bad though, with Audi's being happy to sit 2m behind your bumper rather than overtaking when you are already travelling at a reasonable speed.  That said, the fast lane tends to work quite well, although speed differentials can get a bit silly at times. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This is very much the point. I've made it a point of habit to drive every journey as if I had 12 points on the licence (I don't).

Ha, to be fair, 12 points would (generally, IIRC) mean you shouldn't be driving, but I get your point.

The difficulty is that 20 limits are very poorly obeyed. The council recently had a public consultation asking if my road should be a 20 limit - A long, straight road, 10 m wide (wider than many single carriageway roads), built up on only one side, the primary road serving a large residential area, with large pavements on both sides. One of the things they put in the "benefits" was reduced road speed, but they didn't specify what the reduction was. So, I asked what their historical data was, and they replied: Median vehicle speed dropped from 35 to 32 mph after converting 30 limits to 20 limits. 91% of vehicles exceeded the 20 mph limit after it had come into force. To me, that doesn't sound like the limit doesn't have public buy-in. Moreover, limits have tended to be used to provide protection for specific hazards, and serve to warn the driver of a higher risk ahead. The worry here is that this type of inappropriate limit merely teaches drivers that limits are arbitrary and not there for a purpose.

Agreed entirely. I make an effort to drive at 20 in 20's, but it's sometimes really problematic. Where I am at least, given it's a little hilly, and the 20's generally apply (as you point out..) to what are fairly large roads, with pavements (and often trees and grass sections too) and a lot of people treat them as 30's and drive over 30..  That shouldn't be a problem, but it does throw people off on junctions, and I've had people overtake me (which arguably is more of a problem again..), not to mention that if I don't pay attention to my speed somewhat rigorously you find yourself back at 30 fairly quickly..  

I think I prefer the approaches I've seen in Germany and France with play streets, and nice street furniture and calming measures (Rather than nasty speed bumps and odd priority shifts, if nothing else, just the signage puts you in mind of kids playing, rather than a road safety campaign.  And yes, the arbitrary aspect really is what causes issues, if drivers see it as safe, and don't see the rules enforced (often the case with 20's) the chances of adherence are basically nil (as your stats above suggest).

I'd take that a little further too, there seems to be (again, on a council by council basis..) a massive rush toward signage that isn't appropriate, huge 'Slow' warnings, and chevrons before corners that can safely be driven at the speed limit cause people to slow unnecessarily and lull people into a false sense of security when they come to a corner that actually does require you to slow down significantly for.  That's more noticeable on roads you know obviously (I drive the Snake pass quite regularly and there are a quite a few excessive signing issues on the safe bits, and arguably too little warning on some of the more problematic corners...  And to anyone else who does that road regularly, or somewhat irregularly, the 30 near where the road has slipped and created a ramp is there because at about 30 or more you get tossed off the side of a hill if you aren't careful..).

Oh and maybe I'm just getting old, but the level of reflectiveness of some of those signs has now reached a point where they seem to be a hazard all on their own at night..

But I digress. </TEXT>

The major road and all the housing on the other side is a 20 zone, our little triangle was left out of the 20 zone, so we have big 30 signs at the entrance. It's a bizarre set up (although cars parked on both sides of the road most of the time make 20, never mind 30 somewhat optimistic..

There are issues in Manchester too though, you have a majority labour council that is essentially having to create opposition internally because some poor decisions don't get challenged otherwise.  There is a bit of a lack of consultation (and the catch 22 of consultation often not providing a lot of feedback until you hit actual protests...) but mostly people see and remember failures more than they do successes.

I can't see opinion swinging Tory, but a lot of people seem to be considering voting Green and indeed Lib Dem, or for minor left wing parties to send a message.  Now that doesn't really make a lot of sense (council decisions and parliamentary ones not being the same, and we have a good, solid Labour MP..) but it is a concern, especially if, as I've heard a few times now, people are also seeing the election result as a foregone conclusion and so voting 'not labour' is can be seen as safe because voting labour won't make a difference on the national level..

Not great times, and at least party the fault of complacency and a bit of a failure to communicate successes, even when that is just mitigating Tory fuckery. </TEXT>

I don't think that has actually changed. The fines always technically started at 1mph over the speed limit, the point at which it was enforced was discretionary (I think by police force) and the consensus was, and I think still is 10%.

Its much safer to do 80mph now than it was to do 70mph in the 70s.

That's probably more the issue, we have motorways where it is absolutely safe to drive over 70, but no government seems keen on raising limits even where it would arguably be sensible to do so. </TEXT>

To be honest I'd be happier with the somewhat random limits if my local council didn't essentially use the lack of road maintenance as a traffic calming measure...

<TEXT> Ha, the major 3 lane A road (and ring road..) near where I am is 30 for a very large section, even where it doesn't seem appropriate (50 I could understand..), so I feel your pain.  The best part about that is that the lights are essentially timed for people going 30, but it seems (according to people that I have spoken to but don't know well...) that 60 works just as well.

That said a year or so ago, heading toward Dover from Sheffield at about 2am on the A1 (possibly...), almost no traffic and a reasonable road (I assume the limit was 70) and I had a police traffic car pull the car in front of me that was probably speeding a little.  I saw the reflective strips on the slip road, I'm guessing the chap in front didn't and the police car basically immediately put his pretty blue lights on as he got onto the A road.  You do sort of wonder at that time in the morning, when it's dry and there is no other traffic whether there is any real public benefit.

Still, break the limit and take your chances to a certain extent. And even in Germany you seem to hit fairly arbitrary (and often very arbitrary..) limits on the motorways. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can't wait for driverless cars to be common enough that any poor bastard like me can get one.

I sort of wonder what the impact on electric and driver-less cars will be on the second hand market. 

The cost of replacing batteries in the former, especially 3-5 years after new may make them an expensive prospect. As to driverless cars, once they drop out of their warranty periods, or if they need updates/upgrades/contracts to keep them on the road legally you might see availability of used vehicles, at least of that type, drop too.  The manufacturers would also have almost no motivation to do anything about that, after all, a smaller used car market would be better for them than the current situation.

The only system that does make sense is the one you present in your last paragraph, although I can see that being more expensive than owning a cheap second hand car, even if it is cheaper than owning a new one.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think there is a bit of an imbalance.. I agree with low speed limits in residential areas, it does make it safer for kids and everyone else walking around, but quite a few stretches of A road, and large sections of motorway have flows of traffic that broadly exceed the 70 limit a lot of the time (essentially when there isn't massive congestion..) and modern cars are safe at higher speeds too.  Getting the balance right is really the key bit, I doubt that most people want to do 40 in residential areas, but they also don't want to be stuck doing 70 on long, straight, safe roads where they could safely be travelling quite a bit faster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely. My oldest two kids have had phones since they were 12 (going to secondary school on foot or via public transport - depending on whether they are trying to save their bus fares or not - made being able to contact them more useful than not..), but they aren't new phones and they don't have data connections..

That seems fairly reasonable, taking advantage of the benefits of being able to contact them without having to worry too much about cost etc.. I also generally think it's important that when they go out to play or similar that they aren't always on a tether, so apart from school, it's up to them whether they take their phones. As long as they are wearing a watch and know what time they have to be home it all seems to work reasonably well.

I do know a couple of parents that seem to get very flustered if they can't get a gps fix on tier kids at any given moment though.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good on them and it stops them eating up votes which further strengthen Tory rule.

The number of votes is pretty tiny, and you have to consider how many former communist voters will vote Labour, rather than either not vote, or vote for one of the other parties on the fringes.  You also have to consider whether the communist party endorsing labour means some proportion of more centrist voters decide they'd rather vote Lib Dem, or Green etc.. because they don't like communism.. You are talking about 1200 or so votes across the UK in 2015, that's around the same as the Pirate Party had in the UK with fewer candidates (and about the same number of members..). </TEXT>

<TEXT> diots like Bush, Obama, Clinton and Hollande would bring "democracy" (i.e. anarchy and theocracy) to many more countries if they had their way. 

Of that set, none of them have any power, so.. I'm not sure how it's relevant at this point (also, you missed Blair..). And you are right, they intervened in areas of the world where there was little holding things together and essentially created massive instability.  But they have done that, it's not going away any time soon.

Creating stability = supporting dictators. 

Or invading and occupying a country in a massive manner.. I mean, you have two options, a light touch or a very heavy approach.  Mostly it seems we take the former approach these days, the results don't seem to be great.

Maybe a good plan but lets start with not ousting dictators who keep countries relatively stable and prosperous.

Right, but again, a good plan would suggest something we can do in the future, what that doesn't do is deal with the existing issues.  I agree that we shouldn't go around destabilising any more countries if we can help it, but that doesn't solve the problems now, and it doesn't solve the issues of migration flows from countries where there hasn't been an intervention by the UK/US/France or others either.

I completely agree with refugee camps in the region. This is something that should have happened years ago.

It's something that did happen years ago, the issue is that the scale isn't right and obviously people want somewhere to go later too, offering at least a suggestion that there might be somewhere for them to go back to helps with that. I know quite a few people who had settled in the UK who went back to Libya after the fall of Gaddafi, because they wanted to help rebuild for example.

They often get more than they could ever hope to make in their countries of origin, particularly if you include stuff like top notch medical care. 

They often face vastly lower living standards and less potential too though. 
The draw isn't the money, it's safety and opportunity for their kids and families.  Money is secondary, painting it as though they are here for some quick cash is a little absurd.

They often get more than citizens on welfare, for example by being allowed to skip the queue for social housing, or a stipend for furniture.

That would depend on country, in the majority of cases they'd get less than a citizen on welfare, and they aren't allowed into the queue for social housing, and instead get emergency accommodation that wouldn't be suitable for a normal citizen under normal circumstances.  I'm sure there are edge cases, but again, it's not as though the majority of refugees or migrants end up better off than the equivalent out of work, or homeless national.

Allowing human trafficking is not part of my value system.

Presumably nor is allowing people to die needlessly, even if they took a risk in the first place, and especially if they are fleeing a war.  I didn't suggest that human trafficking was acceptable, it isn't, but rendering aid is both acceptable and generally seen as a positive value. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reducing the motivation for the migrants is easy:

You say that but:

1. Stop removing dictators like Gadhaffi, Assad.

A bit later for the former, and the latter may not be gone, but the conflict isn't going to stop. So you either need to put in place refugee camps that are both safe and comfortable enough in the region, or do more to create stability.

2. Stop offering them a life long cash handout in return for risking their lives on a boat.

I'm reasonably sure no EU countries offer significant, life long, cash handouts to valid asylum seekers or migrants.  Most offer accommodation and a very small amount of money (and actually offer more for return..) to those that qualify.

If anything, perpetuating the notion that if you get into Europe you will be handed cash for life, in the way you have done above, is at least part of the problem (although often it has been a variety of activist groups that suggest more support is available than is strictly true).

Reducing the motivation for the NGOs is easy as well: prison time.

I didn't suggest reducing the motivation for NGO's I suggested that preventing them from saving people at risk of dying isn't something that I'd see as an option if you believe in the values most European states generally seek to claim as their own. </TEXT>

To be fair, picking up people a few km from any coast is saving people from dying, unless they happen to have the capacity to return to that coast, which it seems a lot of the people smugglers intentionally remove once they get to a certain point.

I understand what you mean, in that there is a difference between essentially running a shuttle service, and in picking up people in distress, but in practice that's harder to separate, which is where removing, or reducing the motivation to make the attempt in the first place becomes important.. </TEXT>

What your point seems to suggest however is that someone on the minimum wage (and over 25..) working 38 hours a week would take home around 1,115 a month (after tax and NI) and so can't afford to spend 1200-1500pcm on a small flat in London... </TEXT>

There are a whole slew of areas where the UK has gone backwards (look at what the current government has done to the provision of support for disabled people..) but also where the UK has moved forward.

See that makes sense for the referendum, you vote on the issue, rather than a party position, but when it comes to a General election, all those other issues that generally create party allegiance are more important than just the exit deal. Don't get me wrong, the terms under which we leave the EU are pretty important, but if you vote for a pro-remain Tory over a Labour candidate, you are going to have to consider the impact on education, health, jobs, social security and all the rest of it..  In this case, party allegiance, or rather policy is more important than just the way we leave the EU. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 8 seats.

National polling is often a bad indicator of Lib Dem electoral success because they tend to be good at targeted, local campaigning in specific seats. Most predictors use uniform swings, which rarely apply. For example, it is widely expected that the Lib Dems will be able to win back several of their traditional London seats which were lost to the Conservatives in 2015.

True, but they tend to have that depth in a few areas and it takes a lot (like the 2010 GE, and as much as I don't really like him, Nick helped a lot there..) to push the areas where they are just behind across the line. Lib Dem support is broad, but not deep, its the same problem UKIP had (although it looks like UKIP are about to run into bigger problems...).  I can absolutely see the Lib Dems increasing their vote share from the polling currently, but I doubt it'll translate into seats.. That might change as the campaign goes on of course. </TEXT>

Seriously? There are countries in the EU that have done better, there are countries in the EU that have done less well than the UK. The UK isn't on some downhill slide, it has a conservative government with a different set of priorities (not ones that I happen to agree with, but hey) and every single cut has been carried out within the framework of the EU, and a lot of the progress the UK has made on protections over the last few years has been done without direction from the EU..

The idea that the EU is the protector of living standards or human rights is frankly a bit absurd, we all fought for those and we have to fight to keep them.  Look at countries like Greece (just the most startling example, not the only one...) and tell me that the EU has been responsible for a rise in living standards or the maintenance of protections. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To a certain extent (like when it gives you the day off, or it's a national day etc..), but places like the UK, where religion is still arguably very visible, it has become a more cultural thing than a matter of faith.

You will find people attending certain church events, not because they are religious, but because it is tied into something else (whether that's a wedding, funeral, st Georges day service/parade, remembrance Sunday service etc.) and obviously there is all the legacy stuff, like Sundays in general being a non/reduced-work day for most (non-retail....) workers etc.. There  are also lots of local quirks, like maypoles and [well dressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_dressing) which have pagan or other roots and get appropriated by religion at some points, then become more civic etc..

Given the sheer amount of churches and intermingled 'things' that exist, and the lack of separation between church and state (in the UK at least..) it's to be expected really.

<TEXT> It's an interesting notion, but I think he misses the point. It's not about the EU, it's about making it harder for the opposition to have an impact - 

*"For those sitting around the table in Brussels, this is an irrelevance."*

But for those sitting in Westminster it isn't. If this election goes as it seems it might then May will have the domestic clout to push for whatever she wants to push for and not have to worry about dissenters in her own party. It means she can pass whatever legislation she needs for whatever Brexit she wants (well, to a certain degree..) not tempered by Labour or the Lib Dems.

That's not a good thing for non Conservative voting Brits, whether leave or remain, but it's certainly good for her and will strengthen her hand in the sense that she won't be looking over her shoulder when she tries to play it.

Labours collapse couldn't have come at a worse time.  About the only silver lining if things do go the way they seem to be, is that the EU exit will be an exit, and isn't likely to be some half arsed redux of membership under a different name. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We can't just drop our current work and suddenly start assessing brand new drugs. There is concern about how such a large shift, if it were to come from the MHRA, would take place.

No, of course not. And this is true in all the areas where competencies currently exercised by the EU will be exercised by the UK. But then that's also what the period we are going through now is supposed to deal with, that should mean (although... Tory government...) more funding and recruitment to meet the additional workload. 

Not to mention that this is all before we consider that there is no real reason why the EU and UK can't reach an agreement on equivalence (as the EU has and does do with other countries..).

The point, to some extent, of leaving the EU, was to push these competencies back under the control of the UK government, that's basically the point. Anyone who voted leave and is now concerned about the fact that the UK is going to have to exercise the competencies that have been exercised by the EU really needs to consider what 'leaving' something means, although as I said above, cooperation, coordination and bilateral agreements are also a thing.

With a bit of luck, you'll see more funding and more scope, but we'll see. 

And as a side note, IIRC looking through the MHRA budget a little while ago, the MHRA seems to be incredibly efficient and not a bad place to park some additional funding, possibly together with some close additional cooperation with GOScience to see what other benefits can be found..

*Edit - since I have you here... Any thoughts on the current EU approach to the balance of regulation on 'Novel food's' which seem to fall between medical and food standards competencies? Came up a while back and the approach (any member approval for things I'd have thought would be better regulated by a medicines agency than a food standards agency..) seemed somewhat inconsistent, leading to something akin to regulatory shopping and looked like it might poke a hole in some of the medicines regulation.  Not to mention the absurd approach by importers of unauthorised novel foods to sell things as for 'study/not for consumption/collectors' etc.. where they were clearly intended to be sold for consumption (and even then often as a medical treatment rather than a food or supplement..).*

*Anyway.. I digress.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Could you have a functioning system where the party platforms/promises are scrutunized by an official non-partisan, panel that exposes to the public the feasibility and the pros and cons of implementation, vetoes promises that are unfeasible, and holds parties accountable for implementing the promises that are feasible once elected?The panel could allow parties to break promises only under certain circumstances, like if new scientific data becomes available or the situation changes significantly etc. but the parties wouldn't be allowed to change their minds without explaining themselves to the panel and facing whatever repercussions.

Arguably yes, you could design it into a system as an additional check on government power.  You'd still have several major non-trivial issues to overcome though, and it is a lot of power to grant to a panel (and the usual issues of capture by either politics or someone else..).   

The main problems are pretty obvious ones, starting with the mild issue that a lot of political issues don't have objectively 'correct' solutions, and often you have different schools of thought constantly offering different evidence or suggestions on how to solve them. Throw in the fact that you probably don't want politicians to be unable to change their entirely subjective views and it gets messy quite quickly. 

It also doesn't solve the issues of politicians often not having the power to unilaterally deliver on their promises.

Currently all of that seems to be left up to the media. For democracy to work we need informed, active voters, and accountable, capable leaders. What is the best way to get reliable information to voters? What is the best way to hold leaders accountable? If voters are not adequately informed and all the candidates are unreliable, how does voting stay relevant?

The 'correct' answer is that you need a responsible and independent media with broad freedom to report able to inform the electorate.  Having a reasonably educated (literate at the very least..) electorate is important too obviously, as is the ability for anyone to report and become part of the media.

When that stops working you have fairly major issues anyway. To take your example above, would you be happy with say, the current US government legislating to establish the panels that you describe? Even with a perfect set up, how do you think people, the media or anyone else react to the panels acting on a 'broken promise'?

You absolutely could do it, but it could become as much of an issue, if not more of one, than politicians not always delivering on their promises.

<TEXT>  They weren't the government.

They were part of the government and they allowed the Conservatives to push through their policies in a lot of areas that were quite contemptible.  They are as responsible for that as they are for what they wanted to achieve.  

Now I understand why the Lib Dems did what they did, and it was their choice, but it wasn't the only choice they had.  What it does mean is that they are responsible for what happened whilst they were in government.

As to whether they'd do it again, I mostly agree with you that given they almost destroyed their own support last time around, they are unlikely to do it again.  To a certain extent it doesn't look like they will be in a position where they can again for a while at least either.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd argue though that even if most data was public, that sort of information overload increases the need to have access to analysts and specialists that help you interpret that data. There is a big difference between having access to all of the data about an agency and being able to just sit down with the leader of the agency. They will likely have perspective and insights unique to their experience in working with the data or even forming the policies that you're trying to act on.

Agreed, and again, that is mitigated in some systems by having access to the civil service to some degree, public funding for your own staff and government analysis, although that'll be variable depending on what country you are talking about.

Either way, it's not as though candidates who are allowed those briefings are able to just walk around asking questions and snooping in files. They get the information that the representative from the intelligence leadership chose to share which is going to be a pretty narrow slice.

That's true, and the US is somewhat interesting because most of it's government departments are far more politicised than in other countries, so I can imagine there being shenanigans and posturing in a way that wouldn't be as likely in say Germany..

As I said, it's certainly a factor, but the amount that it matters will depend on candidate, country and issue to a large degree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very true, although quite a few countries mitigate that to a large degree (with access to classified material and government estimates whilst in opposition, subject to the same clearance processes that are applied to the elected officials of the government).  It's also fair to say that a huge amount of information, especially on spending, contracts and so on is public to a large degree now too.

If anything, I'd argue that it's less of an issue for someone looking to be president or the opposition parties in a parliamentary system, more of an issue for individual candidates at a lower level.  As I understand it, in the US, presidential candidates have access to classified briefings on matters of security and similar quite early on.

It'd certainly be a factor though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't think of one directly, presumably because in most democratic systems, winning an election doesn't give the candidate free reign to implement policy over and above the usual parliamentary (or similar) processes. It would put you in the kind of territory where you are holding someone accountable for something they can't deliver on without someone else acting too.

That said, there are things like the [The Salisbury Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Convention) in the UK that prevent the upper house from opposing government legislation promised in its election manifesto (although obviously the government still has to pass it through the lower house etc..).

In addition, some countries allow for [recall elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election) to hold elected politicians to account in office.

I think though the biggest issue you'd hit with anything that made candidates legally accountable for implementing their campaign promises is that you hand a lot of power over to whoever enforces them, potentially in a very problematic way.  The second would be interpretation of the promises and the impact on unforeseen variables and external influences..

Of course a lot of people would say that the next election is when candidates are held accountable for their campaign promises, and failure to deliver would, or at least could result in not getting re-elected..

It's an interesting area though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's for an example say that, I wanted to open a data center. Normally starting a data center while bootstrapping is impossible.

To be fair, if you are a start up without a lot of capital, you wouldn't generally be looking to set up a data centre, and right now you generally don't need to (you can buy server time and resell it more easily now than at any time, essentially anyone can set up a virtual data centre and scale it as required, you don't need to spend the massive amounts required to actually build one until it makes sense to do so.). 

Obviously that does depend somewhat on your idea, but you should be able to at least prove your idea at a smaller scale before you start investing in buildings and lots of depreciating equipment with high maintenance costs.

*Edit: The point was, look for cheap alternatives to get things up and running as best you can, you can sell something that mostly works far better than an idea with a large cost associated with it.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh I'm not denying that you're right, just that sheer numbers isn't the best way of showing that.

My point would be that the absolute numbers are as useful as anything else in suggesting scale, they are clearer and easier to understand.

I'd agree that they don't tell the whole story (in relation to population size as you suggest) but there are other variables ignored either way. 

If it were a smaller increase, or if population growth were relevant, it might make sense. Given we are talking about the increase in the number of graduates of around 1700% for first degrees and 7300% for higher degrees (someone check my working....),  I don't think anyone would assume that population growth would account for the difference (30% increase over the period..).

That said, it's always nice to see data presented in different ways to make it easier to get your head around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> much more solid statistic and sheer number's will include bias such as population growth, the fact we had just come out of a massive war etcetc

Sort of.. It does the job in indicating the difference in access either way, you could do it by head of population, but you'd be ignoring several aspects (foreign students and demographics - there are far more 'older' people now etc..) and in any case, looking at annual award rates doesn't fully show the skew in the proportion of degree qualified people in the population at any given point (i.e, it's massively higher than even the numbers below would suggest after 1992 because of the cumulative effect..).

Although if you are interested, after some rough calculations, It was 3.5 per 10k of population in 1950, compared to 65 per 10k of population in 2016 for a first degree and 0.5 per 10k in 1950 vs 37 per 10k in 2016 for higher degrees. In each case being awarded a degree, not the total numbers with a degree of course. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, by the same reasoning, if it's so easy to get a degree now and almost anyone can do so, does that mean those that choose not to are, by definition, uneducated?

Broadly yes, although it's sort of depends what they did instead of getting a degree and at what point you'd accept someone was educated (does getting 10 GCSE's at A-C leave you educated or uneducated?). If you go and do a multi-year apprenticeship (that'll often lead to qualifications) you'd not be uneducated, arguably if you went to university and didn't get your degree you'd still be educated, but not qualified (and potentially not intelligent..).

'Uneducated' and 'intelligent' are not equivalent terms, of course.

Indeed, and I think that's the issue with the stat on degrees, you have vastly more being issued now than before, that isn't because the current generation are vastly more intelligent, but because there is more emphasis and more access to higher education.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> You mean, if you were to have a General Election with two of the major parties being absolutely identical and having as a sole difference one wantign to leave and one to remain.

Essentially. 

But that is not the case, is it? Both major parties wanted to remain, so the whole point being made, as I see it, is completely irrelevant.

It is irrelevant. That said, some people are suggesting that a party fighting the election on the basis that the UK wouldn't leave the EU might be able to pull in a significant proportion of those that voted remain in the referendum, and so would do very well. The reality is that they likely wouldn't do well enough to get a majority (and realistically would likely do a lot worse, because they aren't going to get close to having all the remain voters voting for them..).

Both major parties wanted to remain, so the whole point being made, as I see it, is completely irrelevant.

Indeed, although neither Labour nor the Conservatives will be running on that basis and even the Lib Dems seem to have pivoted again to a 'softer brexit' stance, rather than a remain stance.

In short though, it comes down to the fact that you can't really use the referendum as a guide to the Election, and that the issues are far more complex than remaining or leaving the EU (and I'd assume that the EU will, as it usually is, be far less important to most people than a slew of other issues..).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I still don't see why the referendum should have been run on constituencies rather than the number of votes, since in the end the vote was for, as you say, yes or no and not to put in place people in seats.

No one is saying it should have been, all that is being said is that in the context of remain and leave voters, if they voted purely on leave and remain issues in a GE, the leave 'party' would win by a much larger proportion of seats than is apparent from the percentage of the vote.  

The point being that even if all the 'remain' voters stuck together and voted to veto leaving the EU, leave voters doing the same would get a much, much larger share of the seats. Or to put it another way, using the referendum as a guide to suggest the two sides are close in electoral terms is false, and the chances of this election 'overturning' the referendum are essentially nil. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a generally fair assessment to day those with university degrees are more intelligent than those with no more than O levels.

On an individual basis, with all else being equal it might be, but then older people had less access to university than people do now, I'd be willing to bet that plays a fairly large part too.  In 1950, 17,300 people received first degrees and 2,400 were awarded higher degrees, in 2016 it was closer to 400,000 first degrees and 240,000 higher degrees.

Do you think that's because people are smarter, or because almost anyone can get access to higher education if they want it and put in some effort now? </TEXT>

If you had a party that got 52% of the vote, by getting a small majority in 70% of the constituencies contested, vs a part that got 48% of the vote, by getting (presumably much larger majorities) in 30% of the constituencies contested, then that 52% would equate to 70% of the seats, and the 48% would get the other party 30% of the seats.

To put it another way, the referendum was close, because it was a straight yes no vote, with the majority winning, the General Election will be run on a constituency by constituency basis. If the referendum were run in that way (and of course it wouldn't be..), the result wouldn't have been close at all.

<TEXT> That's fortunate. Running that kind of facility is very expensive.

The key seems to be partnerships with industry, so it's a case of being able to move through GCSE (and having kit and projects funded at least in part, as well as access to employers for expertise in teaching..).  That seems to be followed by have a route through to the businesses themselves in terms of either apprenticeships, training or a continued link through university.

It seems pretty well put together although it'll be interesting to see if it catches on more broadly, and we see more kids taking it on..

When I've had to use skilled trades in electronics R D (e.g. hand assembly, cabinet wiring) the people we've brought in have all been really close to retirement without any plans to train anyone to replace them. I hope that things have changed over the last 5 years or so.

I wonder how much of that is a demand for experience that you aren't going to get from new entrants, or availability you won't get from people who are working full time in the industry already.  

Don't get me wrong though, there are almost certainly skills gaps, but I don't think it's as acute as some people are suggesting, especially given that some of the skills gaps employers are talking about are at times in areas where you can bring someone (with the right aptitude..) up to speed in 3-6 months with training.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'm genuinely not convinced that this assertion is true. Our ability to train skilled manual/technical workers has taken a massive hit over the last 20 years with the shift towards the service industry. There are still people who have the skill, experience and facilities to train machinists (for example), but there are few of them around; many have now retired. When was the last time you visited a secondary school with both a proper machine shop capable of teaching sessions for 30+ students and the technicians   support staff required to help them learn safely?

Just looking at Sheffield, there seems to be a push to get people back into technical trades (UTC Sheffield taking people from 14 onward as an alternative to the normal GCSE routes), that's with employer sponsorship and so on. Apprenticeships (apart from the genuinely crappy retail ones..) are also far more available for everything from bricklaying and construction through to machinists and engineering.  

When was the last time you visited a secondary school with both a proper machine shop capable of teaching sessions for 30+ students and the technicians   support staff required to help them learn safely?

Two weeks ago (My eldests school just dropped engineering at GCSE, although still offer it for their sixth form and have the equipment and a forge, so I went to have a look at some alternatives...).  You'd be right in saying that isn't the norm though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Broadly your assumption that somehow any benefit from leaving the EU should be tied to manufacturing (which no-one above you in the thread implied).

The line - *"The best we could do is dump our service industry and try and build up a manufacturing one and we'd still be ruined because other countries have so many advantages over us."*

Essentially. I'm not sure why manufacturing is more important than services, we do have a decent amount of one and we do very well in the other... And then your point about the lack of skilled people, it's not a massive issue and it is one we can fix..

<TEXT> You'd expect this to be true to some extent, but the bottom line is that allegiance to party mandates that your MP votes with them on certain issues.

Yes.. And at times that happens, and at other times it doesn't. Your MP will also have input into the party position though and they will generally be able to do a better job of representing you, than your party leader would. 

To put it another way, lets say you are anti-Nuclear (power, weapons, waste whatever..), and that is a major red line for you in terms of voting.  Do you vote for an MP that is pro-nuclear because their leader is anti, or do you vote for an MP that is anti-nuclear even though their leader is pro? Your MP might be running campaigns in support of your position against the general policy position of their party (happens a lot in contentious areas.) surely that's more valuable than a soundbite in a TV debate.

ultimate control remains with the party leaders.

Some control remains with the leaders, diluted by cabinet and subject to the support of MPs more generally.  Putting a spotlight on the leaders is then unhelpful for anything other than making the UK system seem far more presidential than it is and creating more antipathy toward politicians as people realise that the person they voted for, isn't the person they saw on TV.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Essentially the same as if any other country in the world, that produces something we don't make does that. We buy from someone else.  

Very few countries are self sufficient, the UK isn't self sufficient in a whole slew of areas and it supplies things others can't make too.  Surely it's better to be a customer in a large market for a simple good (like steel, where you have lots of producers) whilst making complex goods where there aren't a lot of alternate suppliers.. 

At the end of the day, if China decides it doesn't want to sell us Steel, we can buy from Japan, India, the US, Germany or elsewhere.   It it looks like it's going to get really serious, we'd have to invest in our own infrastructure, we currently produce about the same as Poland (albeit more efficiently and in a more environmentally friendly manner..). The alternative is essentially to subsidise steel production in the UK that has to compete with even cheaper production from elsewhere, surely there are better things we can spend that money on? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure, Corbyn has always voted as Corbyn feels it rights, but the general direction the party wants to take overrules that for most MPs. 

I mean granted, it'll be interesting to see how Corbyn presents the party position in a whole slew of areas where he seems to be operating in contrast to his MPs rather than in concert with them.. Especially given that there won't be an opportunity for the Party to go to the membership for a wholesale change in policy in a range of areas...

Who is in charge of the whip is arguably more important than the local MP, since they control the bigger picture.

Your local MP represents you and will vote and campaign in parliament on the issues that are relevant to you. They are more important to the individual voter than the party leader in isolation.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sort of. We're the 9th largest in the world but we've been dropping continuously for the last 50 years. Our manufacturing sectors output in comparison to other sectors has been dropping as well. It accounts for less than 11% of our national output.

Indeed, but that's still a lot of manufacturing, especially given we are very specifically not a manufacturing economy.  And yes, manufacturing has dropped in terms of it's share of our economy, but that shouldn't be surprising given that as with agriculture, you need far fewer people to make lots of goods, and so have a lot of skilled manpower working in the service economy (one that does very well in fact..).  

A lot of companies in these industries are complaining about a lack of skilled people to hire.

They are although that is changing, with employers starting to take roles (directly, or in sponsorship terms) to bring people through the education system with the relevant skills.  Obviously employers would vastly prefer for there to be an overabundance of skilled people, but they do have the option of training people too (and are starting to do so) and of course the shortages aren't staggering either, we aren't seeing a lack of investment because we don't have skilled people available. </TEXT>

That's probably unlikely as some member states are unlikely to be able to find the domestic support for federalisation and would be a significant brake on the process.  I'd assume you'd lose a few almost regardless, the two speed approach to integration may minimise that, although even then I'd assume that you'd have a different set of 'federal' components initially with more members joining gradually rather than a drop in replacement.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We don't have a manufacturing industry? 

Really? We don't? 

What you mean is we don't employ a vast number of people in manufacturing any more (pretty much no developed economy does..), but the UK is still a major manufacturer.

 The best we could do is dump our service industry and try and build up a manufacturing one and we'd still be ruined because other countries have so many advantages over us.

Why? Our service sector is incredibly good? Why do we need to switch to manufacturing? 

We do have a lot of skilled people (hence being a world leader in a large number of areas, including in some service areas, and things like.. space technology, aviation, high tech engineering etc...

We don't need to try and digress to become a developing economy again and focus on manufacturing.

We had twins as our 'third'.  Strangely it didn't feel like a massive increase in stress or effort (you sort of have everything sorted out after the second, efficiency is the key word and so on..).

It distorts the elections more than it helps and turns the election of 650 MPs, with a whole slew of candidates in each constituency into a popularity contest between a few leaders representing a minority of the people standing...

That's not really accurate, larger councils (as in not parish councils) absolutely deal with substantive issues, and have responsibilities that are pretty important. That would include housing, education (although academisation has changed that), transport, fire and public safety, social care (hence issues there..), some aspects of health provision, transport and so on.  A lot of what has an impact on day to day life for a lot of people is a council responsibility. 

Councils have to fund a lot of fairly important things, council funding cuts really hurt that (councils had to stop funding things that weren't core, and cut back on core services, hence why so many places lost libraries and similar..) and if you look at the devolution models for places like Manchester, you can see how government could shift costs and blame further if it goes that way.

<TEXT> No, quite the opposite, it's important. 

We merged the state with religion, have bishops in the Lords, prayers before meetings, state sanctioned religion in schools and I think partially because of that, and more, we treat religion as an unimportant cultural addon that's sort of nice, no-one actually believes in any of it, but we know the words to some of the songs, and the ideas are non-threatening, and frankly we occasionally wonder if the priests actually believe in god..

The US on the other hand has strict separation, no religion in schools, protests against prayers near meetings and as a result, they have people screaming about religious persecution, religion being vital in politics, visible religiosity being demanded, violent anti-abortion events on the back of religion, mega-churches that both fuel more religiosity and drag in money from people who can least afford it and so on..

We essentially made religion irrelevant by making it less about faith and more about culture and politics, that seems to work quite well... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having a preference is one thing but how strong and for what reason?

Broadly a weak preference (in that it wasn't a high priority) and a variety of different reasons...

It seemed pretty clear to me that many leave voters, voted that way due to local issues that had nothing to do with the EU whatsoever. 

I'm not sure it was particularly and anti-Westminster vote, although there was a bit of an anti-politician vote (aimed at both the EU and Westminster).  But again, there were a lot of different drivers, some valid, some less so, and on both sides of the issue.

It wasn't that long ago that leaving the EU was little more than a pipe dream and joining the euro was the main EU related issue in the UK.

You'd be right to say that not long ago, leaving the EU was seen as a political impossibility, no-one was offering it, but then again joining the Euro was pretty much a non starter too, there was little to no support. Even at the height of Labours popularity there wasn't enough support to push it through.

It was mainly brought up by parties like the BNP which most people don't want to be associated with. 

That isn't true. You've had sections of both the Conservative and Labour party who were anti-EU, they were just never the controlling factions. On the harder left and harder right there has always been an anti-EU preference (On the right for reasons around immigration, nationalism and the ability to legislate on areas that were under EU control, and on the left for reasons of anti-globalisation, anti-capitalism, internationalism, the idea that the EU is broadly hostile to the 'global south' and the ability to legislate on areas that were under EU control.. However, broadly the major parties platforms were pro-EU, so if you wanted sane health, education, defence, transport and other policies, you had little choice.

While there were other parties like UKIP, the Referendum party and Veritas their support was incredibly low. 

Indeed, and quite self-destructive. That's what I was talking about in terms of there being little political choice, no real options to express an anti-EU view (especially recently) at the ballot box, without also voting for parties that were pretty problematic.  That meant people felt disconnected and not listened to on the issue.. Not positive for the EU and a good culture to grow scepticism in, quite correctly..

While the press were Eurosceptic and politicians tried everything not to appear to be too nice on Europe..

It wasn't a high priority, and no-one in the centre of politics would stand up for it, but a lot of people were euro-sceptic. You would not be surprised to find someone in favour of leaving the EU, and even less surprised to find people who were critical of it.

It has less support in the UK than it does in many other developed countries....  It is pretty clear that the UK has the opposite agenda as shown by the ban last year .

Yes.. But there is quite a bit of popular support for it.. 47% of people in the UK would like to see legalisation, 39% don't.. It's not a fringe issue (again, you don't have to look far to find people who support legalisation, and many of them in the centre ground when it comes to politics, but you'd have to look quite hard to find a major party supporting it..).

There are or at least use to be many people who would say yes in a poll to pretty much any referendum...

That's slightly misleading though, essentially that's polling to suggest that people would like to have a say in things, but broadly people don't call for them, and the UK doesn't have them on minor issues..

Personally, I was against it when it was first announced so you can't accuse me of opposing it just because I didn't get the result that I wanted.

You'll note I haven't..

It was David Cameron who pushed for it and he managed to convince people from other parties to vote for it..

The point is that our representatives, the ones we elected, overwhelmingly voted to give people a choice on this issue, in part because one side of the argument was poorly represented.  In democratic terms that seems like a net positive.  You could of course argue that they failed in their primary duty, and instead we should have had a 'leave the EU' bill with the attendant lobbying and consultation instead, but I'm not sure that would have fixed the underlying issues..

Not really, David Cameron announced his intentions about 3 years before announcing the date that it was going to be held. During that period there was little debate and the only real major debate was the Clegg v Farage thing during the European Elections...

That's not how I saw it in the UK, although of course my view will likely be different from other peoples.. The issue started to come up in lots of related areas (doing some work in TTIP it came up again and again..), there was certainly more focus on Europe, people became more aware of what was going on and informed themselves about the EU (which both helped cement opposition and support...).  The noise levels grew at the end, but the discussion seemed to start much, much earlier.

UKIP always did that but it was only then that they had enough support to do that. However the EU wasn't in the top issues for many UKIP voters.

I'd argue that for UKIP voters, the EU was the top issue across the board. UKIP tried to tie everything into the EU, even in local elections.. It was all about the EU, all the time... I'd also argue that the EU was the only sensible position that UKIP had to attract voters from other parties, without the EU, UKIP was just BNP light.  Frankly it'll be interesting to see where UKIP goes without the EU as a central issue to tie things to..

To be honest they are pretty low in many countries so it isn't just a UK problem. People don't really have a strong enough reason to care about these elections as such don't vote. 

That's not an argument against my point though, it's arguably an argument that it's valid in more countries than just the UK.  You are right though, most people didn't care enough about these elections to vote, they didn't see that they had any influence at the EU level, and didn't really see governments representing their views at the EU level either. At that point, why vote...

UKIP do much better in them because so few people bother to vote and they spent so much time and effort in marketing themselves during them while other parties don't.

Absolutely, and they could get their core vote out.. It also helped that the EP elections were more proportional and over a wider region.

I don't agree one bit. There was a decent idea of what will happen, at least in the short term if remain won but nothing for leave. Such thing should be unacceptable in such an important vote.

We knew what would happen in the short term, because it's in the treaties. The UK would notify and then negotiate with the EU.  Everything else is up in the air and down to what can be agreed.. The government can promise literally nothing at this point, beyond that they won't take a deal that is actively damaging (where leaving without a deal makes more sense..).  They have and continue to lay out their approach in a very vague way, but frankly that's more long term anyway.  

It is actually rather contestable with many people arguing that it isn't. There has been loads and loads of articles about how it wasn't the will of the people. 

About the only thing that is clear from the referendum, is that more people would prefer to see the UK outside of the EU than in it. Anything else, the level of support for various approaches now, is up in the air.  Now I had a quick look at the links you dropped in and frankly, they are infuriating. Polling is less accurate than an actual referendum, we don't get to analyse polling data, which specifically requires you to get the weighting and extrapolation is right, and assume it is more accurate than the actual election.  We also don't get to look at demographic shifts and imply changes in opinion on the back of that.. We had a vote, in that vote, more people voted leave than voted remain by a small but significant margin. Turnout was reasonable and there hasn't been a significant shift back.  Yes, I'd have liked a larger margin (I'd actually bet that if we ran the vote again now, we'd see a larger margin..), but surely it is not reasonable to infer that actually people didn't mean to vote leave, or that leave voters are old and so will die soon etc.. but disregard an actual poll with tens of millions of votes..

That is why we needed a plan so people had less doubts on what they were voting.

We don't get to decide that though, it's a joine EU/UK negotiated position. 
 
That could simply be that people tend not to like change but once it is implemented they are more supportive of it.

Yes.. it could be that, and I suppose we will find out because the city level devolution is taking place.

It could be much better, if it was there would be little appetite for referendums as they would feel rather represented already. 

Agreed, although I think there is already little appetite for referendums.  That said if people were better represented generally, the UK would potentially already have left the EU.

FPTP creates a lot of disenfranchisement, I despise UKIP but it is unfair that they only got one seat with nearly 4 millions at the last election.

It is, and the same goes for parties like the Lib Dems and Greens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The public demand wasn't actually that great and was pretty much a non issue until fairly recently. 

It was a continuous low level thing though, and across the political spectrum. You had a lot of people (as evidenced by the referendum..) who had a preference for leaving..  The issue essentially was that it wasn't on offer by anyone you'd actually want to vote for (leaving UKIP..).

Leaving the EU was largely a fringe issue until the coalition. This issue pretty much crept up on many people. While the Conservatives have been fighting about Europe since Thatcher was PM.

I don't think it was a fringe issue in the sense that most people didn't have a view, but a fringe issue in that it was far less important than almost any other issue. It's a bit like saying legalising cannabis is a fringe issue, it is, but a huge number of people would support it if you offered it (and arguably it is an issue with more mainstream party support than leaving the EU...).

Referendums are very popular, in general even if I think that they are a terrible idea for many reasons. As such they are quite an easy thing to sell to the public. As on the surface they give the appearance of max participation.

I don't think that's terribly fair. There isn't a lot of support for other referendums, including on contentious issues. No-one is calling for a referendum on the privatisation (or not..) of the NHS for example, or a referendum on Tuition fees..  The EU referendum was more akin to the Scottish Independence referendum in that way, it was about governance and association, with no other political mechanisms available to make it an issue (without throwing away every other position..).  

And obviously it was a referendum that was authorised by Parliament, with the commons voting 544 to 53 in favour of holding a referendum with only the SNP opposing the Bill... It wasn't a government pushing something through, it was well supported by all parties, including parties that are now utterly opposed to the result.

It was one of many issues and to most people not a particularly important issue. It was through great effort that anti-EU people were successful at pushing their agenda. While the pro-EU side didn't really bother until it was far too late.

Very true, but again, once a referendum was offered, the discussion and debate essentially started immediately. It's not as though everyone ignored it until the official campaigns kicked off.  UKIP did a very, very good job of putting it front and centre of the political agenda once the referendum was on the cards, but that's to be expected. It became a more important issue once people became aware that they would actually be able to have some sort of input (something that had been missing in the UK, on the EU for a long time, as evidenced by the voter turnouts in EP elections..).

Then he shouldn't have hold the referendum if he wasn't going to plan for it. They don't actually put issues to bed and there was no excuse to think that it would work like that.

I mean, don't get me wrong, I agree with you that the government should have done the prep work in the run up to the election, but the lack of planning was by design.  And more to the point, you could argue that there was no need to plan for either outcome because the referendum was the starting point, there would be time after the result to plan to implement it.

No it wasn't people who voted leave were voting on what their perceptions on it were and if the alternative was pretty much the status quo it seemed rather attractive to many.

People would always have voted on what their perceptions of the result would be. It's not as though the government could have offered an exact outcome of things like the UK/EU negotiations (they'd have had to essentially say what they are saying now, which frankly would have been more beneficial to the leave side than remain..).  As it was you had discussions about what possibilities there were and what the issues with the EU were.

You don't have to have a referendum for those issues either and there a many other ways to deal with them. 

Such as?  The UK has elections, or referendums.. I suppose you could throw in public consultations and the like, but they still come down to parliamentary votes based on the outcomes of referendums..

The US for an example has a super majority system for major constitutional changes. While many other countries think that an electoral mandate is good enough. 

The UK generally takes the latter approach, except in a very few, select instances, AV, Scottish independence and the EU (joining and leaving I suppose) seem to have been the primary ones.  The UK could of course have just had a parliamentary vote to remove itself from the EU, but instead had a parliamentary vote to set up a referendum instead.. that seems reasonable.

I am personally not keen but if we are going to have a referendums especially on such monumental and wide ranging decisions there should be great care and effort put into them to make sure that they truly reflect the will of the people.

I don't think there is much question that the result of the EU referendum reflects what a majority of people want, that is to say they'd rather see the UK not be part of the EU. The issue really is the wider question of what the new relationship should look like. That is complex, and now that there is an indication that people want to be out of the EU, it seems that the nature of the relationship will be down to Parliament and this, and of course future governments.  Surely that is reasonable?

I would argue that Germany is much more successful MMP is a much better voting system than FPTP 

I'd mostly agree with you, although I've come to rather like the constituency link in the UK context and think something like AMS, to preserve the geographic link and create a more proportional outcome might be a way forward..

and Germany has embraced federalization but I digress. 

The UK has an issue there, there isn't any support for it. Even the devolution at the city level taking place now is essentially against the wishes of local populations.. That is something that probably needs sorting, but now I digress.

My point would be that the UK does a good job in terms of it's democracy, yes it has issues, but it does balance the various issues that we have in democratic systems reasonably well, as well as any other EU state at the very least.

The UK never had a nationwide one until 1975 and as such it is a pretty recent thing. In fact some people in the past thought that they were anti-British.

Indeed.

<TEXT> I think someone did calculations on it a little while ago, essentially they took the UK's net contribution of 8.6bn (what the EU would lose) and compared it to the amount of people currently making use of EU freedom of movement  (1.2m) to assess what the EU might consider a reasonable contribution (annually, not one off) to cover the loss.  

Just redoing the numbers, it'd be 7100/y assuming just the people already in other parts of the EU took it up, 3500/y if everyone already in the EU, and a similar number in the UK took it up, and anything down to 500/y if everyone who voted remain took up the offer (although I dount all would, and no doubt some leave voters would..).

That said, I doubt the EU would take that approach and obviously it could be a lot less, and no doubt the rights you'd have would be different, but it's certainly interesting to think about.  I could see some glaring issues though, you'd hear complaints that people who voted leave would take advantage of it to retire and work in the EU etc.. Criticism that young people and poorer people would effectively be locked out because of costs and so on.

Still, 1000/y for EU citizenship doesn't sound too bad, if it takes off the EU might want to offer it as a way of making some money to other nationalities..

<TEXT> The referendum was called primarily for party political reasons and was rushed through with little considerations.

The referendum was called for political reasons, but those political reasons included public demand. There has been support for a straight in/out referendum in the UK for quite a while, and a long period of people not having their views on the EU being represented by any of the major political parties.  That suggests that as well as the political reasons, there was a practical and very sensible reason to call a referendum.

The campaigns made practically no effort to contribute to constructive debate and inform the public. 

That I can't fault, the campaigns were pretty shite, but then the discussions on the EU started well before the campaigning did and there were many, although fewer than I would have liked, opportunities for people to debate and discuss the EU and the UKs membership.  

 There was no plan in place and David Cameron was so confident of a remain victory that it didn't matter. 

Cameron was confident of a victory and seemed to believe that not allowing the civil service to plan, and not having the government plan would aid the remain argument.  To be honest, the fact that leave won the argument despite that, and that the new government after Cameron's resignation put a plan together and is now running through that would suggest that the lack of a plan was somewhat immaterial to the referendum.  

I don't agree with referendums at the best of times but such terrible mismanagement is inexcusable.

That's a perfectly valid position to take, but it does raise the problem of how you deal with divisive issues that people can't get a resolution on in the normal political framework, whether that is electoral reform, independence, or membership of super-national unions.  There is a place for referendums, and in the UK at least, they are all authorised by a representative body in the first place (one that could act unilaterally on the issues too..) so it's not that problematic.

 Germany is a successful democracy that has outlawed such referendums and it has worked very well.

The UK is a successful democracy that has referendums reasonably rarely and it seems to have worked very well too, so I'm not sure that the referendums aspect is the biggest issue..

 There is no reason to hold referendums in a representative democracy anyway.

There are very few reasons to hold referendums in a representative democracy, but the exercise of self determination would be one good reason, determining the shape of governance would be another.  Mostly though you are right, you don't need a referendum for the every day running of a country. </TEXT>

I'd agree that having a two way agreement would make sense, but having it one way seems less optimal for the EU.

<TEXT> Long story short, it only costs about 100 quid to stand in an election.

It costs nothing to stand in a local, and 500 in a parliamentary (and then goes up for regional). You can stand in a council election if you can get some mates to sign your nominations papers.  A little harder if you want to do it as a party (because you'd have to set up, and maintain that admin) but still not expensive.

You'd spend more on leaflets (free postage with a parliamentary run though) than on deposits in most cases, if you get one to everyone who can vote in any case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't. In the case of spain you can reside for three months. After that you have to apply for a visa and satisfy the conditions laid out in Spanish Order 1490.

Not quite, you would have to register with the authorities and obtain a residence certificate, (which requires you to prove you can support yourself financially and have healthcare insurance), but that isn't a visa, that's essentially showing that you conform to the requirements of exercising your right to free movement under the treaties. 

If you compare that to the requirements you'd need to meet to move to Spain as a non-EU citizens (well, in most cases anyway) it's far easier, and nothing like one of the visa processes, you also end up with more rights. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would be great for the EU. The inevitable brain drain from the UK to EU will be so much easier.

It'd continue the conditions under which the UK has operated for the last few decades, so I'm not sure why you'd see an increase in migration out of the UK, especially as it'd take the pressure off people who had intended to leave but see Brexit as a threat..  About all it'd do is mean that UK citizens had far more opportunities than EU ones (and remember, there are more UK citizens in Australia than across the EU..).

The UK is a developed economy where smart people can make a lot of money and live a decent life, that'll always be attractive to migrants and it'll make a brain drain far less likely than if the UK were an unattractive place to live for smart people.

I mean seriously, you think the EU would see this as an optimal outcome? EU migration to the EU under normal visa rules and any Brit can up and move whenever they want, set up businesses in the EU and generally access all the things they can now, but without the UK paying for that or reciprocating? 

I doubt that the vague notion that there may be some positive benefits from UK migration to EU countries, beyond what exists already will be sufficient to offset the negatives. If you add on political perception (Brits get to keep all their rights, but the UK has no responsibilities..) it gets even worse.

Now I'd agree that a sensible bilateral agreement makes a lot of sense, but the EU simply deciding that UK citizens can just keep whatever rights they have and be done with it seems unlikely. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Political polarization in the US is a one-sided phenomenon. The right has been gunning toward the extreme right for decades. The GOP is now full of ideologues who refuse to acknowledge objective facts let alone attempt any bipartisanship. If you want to learn more, read about the southern strategy and how racism was used to pull white workers into the extreme right. Look up how the mercers and kochs have extorted the republican party to turn into the extreme right.

 Look to the ACA, which was the conservative healthcare plan. It was very similar to Romneycare. Romney is a conservative. The ACA received over 150 revisions from the republican party and it did not include a national public option (which is something the left wants and the right are against). It is a right wing plan. But when it came to vote, 0 republicans voted for it. Why is that? Why would republicans vote against their own plan just because a democrat was president? Could it be that the extreme right threatened to fund primaries of every moderate who voted for it, thereby eliminating the chance of bipartisanship? Why did republicans vote 60 times to repeal their own plan when Obama was president. And now when they have congress and the presidency, they can't repeal it. Why is that?

Indeed, that became very visible when the Tea Party rose to prominence and has continued from there, through the last election with Trump.  But the question isn't so much about party positioning, as it is about people too.  Why is the more extreme view being supported by so many people on the right, and why is the response by the left in the US so seemingly weak?

If you look at the issues being raised in the linked article above, it is about the apparent extreme positions on both sides, not the middle ground and the middle ground seems to be getting lost between both parties.  

The GOP has moved into the extreme right. They live in a different world. They do not agree on basic facts of reality.

The democratic party has actually moved right as well. But the GOP has moved sooo far right, it can't even see the same reality as anyone else.

Right, but the people who support either side, are actual people, who have to go to work and live etc.. with people who have different views than their own.  If the division is now so large, how do you address that? Surely there is something more useful to be done than shouting insults at either side.

The issue that seems really problematic is the instinct, on both sides, to take any argument from the other, and discard it as racist/stupid/xenophobic/unpatriotic/weak or similar rather than on actually looking at the issues.

The ACA is a great example of that, it's a shit bit of legislation, but it's much better than what was there before. It does provide more protections to patients, but it also cements the value for businesses... In all it is obviously a compromise, at least partially forced by the right, but it is also pretty clear that there would be better ways of doing it. Everyone seems to agree on what is needed too, in terms of costs, but no-one seems to want to entertain any kind of real discussion about what is wanted and how to get there (and yes, that's a horrible oversimplification).

I only see one side that interprets the bible literally- that think noah's ark actually happened. I only see one side claiming that a zygote or a fetus is a human. I only see one side claiming that Obama is a muslim. I only see one side fetishizing guns. I see one side denying climate change. I see one side shouting to "build the wall".

Yeah, that'd be the extreme right, and all of those are incredibly idiotic views.... But you do have issues on the extreme left too, and you generally only hear about them from the right, in much the same way as you mostly hear about the views of the extreme right, from the left.

That's the problem isn't it? You tar people in the centre with a brush that includes a lot of views from the fringes, and then wonder why they think your views aren't realistic.  

And again, you seem to be very keen on presenting the views of a party, and often the fringes of that party, as the views of everyone who you see as the opposition. 

Of course you aren't going to convince a hyper-religious, climate change denying, anti-abortionist racist, with no critical thinking ability that birth control is important in medical provision, but you also aren't going to convince the average 'normal' conservative to listen to you if you assume that they are a hyper-religious, climate change denying, anti-abortionist racist, with no critical thinking ability.

Let me know when you figure it out.

I'm not a conservative, certainly not a Republican so I don't know why it's relevant to the idea that you can simply ignore a huge swathe of a population.. But hey, that's up to you. </TEXT>

That's a slightly bizarre statement, the EU can't really 'put the UK in it's place' at best it can offer a shitty deal that the UK can't take, but under any scenario the EU isn't in a position where it could threaten the survival of the UK..

The sensible scenario is still a deal that provides as much benefit to both sides as possible. The drama really is around whether the EU Parliament can do much to influence the end position, beyond threatening to veto, that'll be interesting to watch, but I don't think the end result will be a powerful EU parliament dictating to the UK.. </TEXT>

With new-builds it seems leaseholds are the exception and that really should have been pointed out by the solicitor, especially if you are talking about something where you have an escalating ground rent, or indeed if the leashold ends within a reasonable amount of time, like 50 years or so.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well it's either that or hard border in Ireland, if that's so important for Ireland, the UK will oblige right?

Why is that or a hard border? Again, the EU can't force Ireland to put up a hard border, neither the UK nor Ireland want one so it's not going to happen, and the UK isn't going to give the EU the power to determine how it manages internal borders between different parts of the same country..

What the EU can do is set up borders agains't the whole Ireland.

Ireland isn't in Schengen, it has borders with the rest of the EU..

The UK is weaker than ever, it's the perfect time to make a move toward the reunification.

Yeah, that'll happen when people in Northern Ireland and Ireland want it, and that doesn't look like any time soon.

About the only thing you'd achieve with your suggestions is anger in both the Unionist and Republican camps in Northern Ireland, and piss off the Irish government and people whilst you are at it.

<TEXT> Leasehold is nothing new as in the case of my parents house 30 years ago, it was 10 per year but I don't think anyone bothered to collect it.

Ours is about 4 a year and we have to go to an office where we pay it (and it gets noted in a large, paper book to boot..).  It hasn't ever really been anything other than a minor thing, I can't imagine what it'd be like to find that it increases to the point of being serious money. The same goes for permissions to do things on the property, we've never been charged to get permission and I'd be pretty peeved if someone tried to charge hundreds of pounds to allow me to modify a property I own, even if they own the land..

I also would not touch new builds with a barge pole, every few weeks there seems to be something in the news about developers cutting corners on the builds then the houses start to fall apart after a year or two.

Sort of, my parents bought one a little while back and it's fairly decent, I assume it matters what you buy and how though.

Seems to me they are praying on the naivety of first time buyers and perhaps not reading all of the small print that the solicitor should be flagging up. Question is, where is the money going? I have no doubt that brown paper bags are being exchanged between the developers and local councils to free up the land for cut of the leases.

Well, apparently the builder only got 140k for the leasehold, the company that bought it seems to be in a position where it could make rather a lot more. I doubt the council is involved though, I can't see any reference to the land being council before hand, and there is no eminent domain type deal occurring (As we've seen with some of the shady London deals). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I was discussing this with the other half a while ago (I hadn't seen this on reddit either..) the scenario that I can see as really problematic is the involvement of the solicitor.  If this was planned in some way, and the solicitor pushed the agreement on the leaseholds and didn't press for the freehold, allowing the builder to sell to Gateway property management (for a really low sum given the return..) and for Gateway to make a lot of money, then it seems far more dubious.  I suppose we'll see what happens.  I'd sort of assume that the same solicitor wouldn't want to touch all of those elements though (the conveyancing, the sale of the freehold and potentially the terms as well) as that mush lead to some sort of conflict.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right wing violence seems to be at least as common, both in terms of the kind of street violence you are referencing (although there seems to have been a bump in that since the election) and the various attacks on Planned Parenthood, the Charleston church shooting in 2015, the attack on Las Vegas police officers, the Overland Park Jewish Community Center shooting) and the 2014 Pennsylvania State Police barracks attack, (just looking at the last few years). In short Right wing violence and extremism seems pretty much alive and well in the US. </TEXT>

If the EU tried to 'force' Ireland to close and enforce a birder between it and the North (which frankly I'm not sure Ireland would do even under significant pressure) the EU would look like it was the one pushing for a much harsher partition of the Island after a long period where there has been progress and cooperation..  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not what's being said, he's saying that the EU shouldn't break their own rules whilst enforcing them on the UK. Essentially, the EU is exercising the UK's trade competencies, if it is, then the UK has a right to be involved in that. If the EU is excluding the UK, then the UK and EU should agree to allow the UK to exercise those competencies..  The EU should follow the rules if it wants the UK to do the same, because if the EU doesn't follow the rules that will harm the UK and the UK would have to find some way of mitigating that harm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly don't see how anyone looks at the Syrian conflict and doesn't conclude that the EU should have acted decisively (certainly with hindsight) given the plight within Syria's borders and the consequences for europe (economic, social, political, security)...

I think there is a difference between concluding that the EU should have acted decisively and concluding that the EU can't act decisively.  I absolutely agree that action should have been taken, and far earlier, preferably with as much international support as possible, and preferably led by European countries rather than the US. However, I would also say that the EU is incapable of acting and the few countries that could have didn't have any interest in doing so unilaterally, or in conjunction with Russia or other regional partners.

As far as US involvement, again I'm perplexed by the view that US involvement is based on regime change.

I think part of that is because the US has maintained the position that there should be regime change, and supported groups in Syria who went beyond simply fighting ISIS. Regime change in Syria is a regional policy and preference for the US..

US has been dragged/shamed into the limited role it has played. Hell, just look at the red line bluff -- Obama had no interest in getting involved other than addressing the brutal human rights violations/crimes.

The US has essentially been more interested in containment than anything else, the US could end the war in a matter of weeks if it wanted to (by invading..) but quite understandably doesn't want to. So could Russia for that matter, or a combined European force, assuming the other major powers involved agreed in any case.

I think the problem is that the stated aim is dealing with IS, but that has morphed into very limited action by everyone involved, bar the Syrian government and Russia who have been prioritising recapturing the country, with fighting IS being a bit of a sideline (and then there is Turkey doing its thing too, and Iran for that matter).

In short, it's not simple. The US isn't there for purely humanitarian reasons and it's acting as it is to balance its interests, which frankly is what every other country is doing too, so it shouldn't be held up to a massive amount of shaming either.

That said, I haven't really seen (from the UK side at least..) a lot of demands that the US do more either, in fact I've seen a few groups opposed to US involvement and the usual (and again, reasonable..) criticisms when things go wrong, but no shaming of the US in general. I think in other parts of the EU there are more people arguing that this is all essentially the fault of the US/UK and so they should be responsible for fixing it (and so responsible for the refugee crisis and so on) but that's broadly a minority view too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think the US would have had a problem with europe deciding to take on the situation in syria... 

That would depend on how the EU decided to take the situation on to a large extent. If it didn't follow the US path, I doubt it'd be seen as a positive.

and why on earth would russia's interest preclude europe from having position.

It wouldn't (and doesn't) preclude the EU from having a position, or any European country from having one, it would however limit the options for the EU or individual EU countries from acting on that position.

Europe has endured costs from the Syrian that are far greater than Russia's benefits -- your comment re Russia makes my point crystal clear.

Right.. And Syria is still formally a Russian ally, even the US refrained from striking Syrian government positions or Syrian military assets up until the cruise missile strike this week, and then it was with pre-notification to the Russians (sensibly..). The EU could either work with Russia, or it would have to be in a position to act in opposition to Russian interests. How many EU countries do you think would have any interests in the latter? And do you think the US would be happy with the EU working with Russia and so the Syrian government to stabilise the country?

Neither the EU, nor any other European state, nor the US for that matter involved themselves in Crimea at least in part because the risk wasn't worth it and there were fewer regional factors for the US. The same broadly goes for the issues in Georgia. It isn't that different in Syria, the EU and European states would be constrained in what they can do by how far Russia would allow them to go before intervening more strongly to support Assad.  

Of course, and just allow Assad's slaughter to run its course.

That's not the reason the US is in Syria though is it? 

The US isn't in Syria to take down Assad, it is in Syria as part of a multinational effort to degrade and destroy IS (or what was referred to as ISIL/ISIS). That effort includes Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates as well as some of the groups in Syria that aren't IS affiliated. 

It's probably worth noting that the EU as a whole isn't part of that multinational effort either, nor are most European countries, with some somewhat opposed to operations. Last I checked the countries in support of the anti-IS operations included Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey and the UK, of which all bar Turkey are EU members, if you switched that to an anti-Assad operation, you'd probably lose a few of those too (likely not Turkey or the UK, but potentially the others).

In short, half of Europe doesn't seem to see Syria as an issue that is relevant to them, the remainder see it as an anti-IS operation not about removing Assad, and the UK/US element, which is both anti-IS and anti-Assad doesn't have the backing to do more and is currently essentially continuing a fairly long established policy of maintaining regional influence and denying it to other regional players. </TEXT>

<TEXT> EU as a unified block is the only thing that can oppose US hegemony.

That's a nice notion, and it's true in a sense, but I don't think the EU is even on a path in that direction yet.  The EU isn't even heading in the direction where the US, and US dominated groupings like NATO are less important for European defence than the EU and frankly in the absence of the UK that seems less likely now than ever.  The EU is even further away from being able to challenge US interests or policy positions outside of the EU's own borders, even when that applies to it's immediate neighbours.

How do you see this going? The EU taking a first step toward superpower status might be interesting, but it's be a very long road and I don't think a lot of EU members would be on board for a lot of what would be required.  Hell, even countries like China don't seem keen on that and China is far more united and able to act as one entity than the EU is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are pretending that the rights of EU citizens in the UK suddenly end after Brexit.  I don't believe that is the case. Ultimately, what their future rights will be will depend on the negotiations

Their rights under the treaties end. Those resident in the UK will get whatever rights are agreed under the exit terms with the EU, and I hope that they are essentially drop in replacements for what they have now in the context of the EU..  

My point however isn't that they won't have any rights, but that EU citizens currently are unclear what those rights will be. As such some are quite sensibly looking to secure their position under existing UK law (outside of the EU context) now, so that regardless of the negotiation outcome, they will have the right to continue to reside and work in the UK etc..

They may not need to do any of that, but at the moment some people are playing it safe and securing their position regardless of whether the UK and EU agree on something or not.

For the UK to preempt that negotiation by trying to create facts on the ground by a tough line against EU citizens is certainly not correct.

What is the UK preempting? If you've lived in the UK for a certain amount of time legally, you can, under UK law (and irrespective of EU agreements) apply to have your status as a resident recognised, or even apply for citizenship etc.. That's what these people are doing, the UK hasn't changed anything, but people are using processes broadly intended for non-EU nationals to secure their future beyond the period where their rights are guaranteed under the current arrangements...

No-one is taking a particularly tough line against EU citizens, the processes being used and the responses being received are the same as those that would go to any person (EU or non-EU) applying for a specific immigration status.

To put it another way: An EU citizen currently in the UK, under the current arrangements does not have to apply for ILR to remain in the UK long term, someone on a visa would have to as they came to the end of their visa period. If an EU citizen however decides to apply, because they are now concerned about what will happen when the UK leaves the EU, they will go through the same process as any other applicant.  The exception being that if an EU citizen is turned down, they won't have to leave the country (because they have additional rights to remain that a visa holder likely doesn't..).

That process is not, and has never been particularly nice, it is bureaucratic, involves a lot of admin, and the burden of proof is on the applicant.  

The point is that up until recently EU nationals haven't felt the need to go through the process of formally getting residency (the same would be broadly true of applying for citizenship), but now they are doing so voluntarily, before the negotiations on status.  They aren't being discriminated against and the UK isn't taking a tough line on EU citizens, it's just that the UK has always taken a bit of an arseholish approach to those applying for residency..

The home office have always been a bit harsh when it comes people applying for residency and similar, EU citizens haven't had (and still don't have) to, some are now doing it in anticipation of the UK leaving and it turns out the home office are still being a bit harsh..

Does that make more sense?

<TEXT> Either nations within the EU need to start acting more unilaterally, or EU needs to act more deliberately as a whole. 

France and the UK do act unilaterally when their interests are at stake, they can't act unilaterally in Syria though, given they'd be stepping on both the US's and Russia's toes.. The remainder of the EU can't really act unilaterally as they aren't that capable.. 

The EU also can't act as a whole, because it's not a country, and only a relatively loose union when it comes to defence and foreign policy. It's not like the EU as a whole can dictate a direction and within the EU you have countries that take very conflicting views on what is required in Syria..

seeing the consequence of something like Syrian civil war (imho) leading to a major EU player leaving the union

The UK isn't leaving the EU because of Syria.. The immigration issue that raised its head in the UK wasn't primarily focused on refugees or migrants, but rather internal EU migration. I'm sure the refugee flows had some impact, but they weren't have been anything like as relevant as a lot of other issues that the EU has.  The UK has never been that keen on the EU political project (although was very much on board with the trade aspects) and has been diverging for a while.

the EU needs to wake the fuck up and start being more proactive

How? The EU can't act unilaterally without consent of Russia and the US, it can't simply intervene in Syria because it'd end up facing a massive response from Russia (or the US) either directly or indirectly and it doesn't have anything like the capabilities or depth that the US does militarily.

Instead of hoping the Americans take care of the problems (even if the problems aren't of EU's creation, still need to deal with problems caused by others).

To be fair, the US could pull out of Syria tomorrow, they won't because they are concerned about the region and want to see a solution that fits their positions in the middle east, rather than a Russian or Iranian one. 

This isn't about the US doing a job that no-one else wants, it's the US trying to maintain the power balance in its favour in the Middle east, and no-one else really being in a position to do much about that.. </TEXT>

I'm confused where you are getting the idea that anyone is suggesting that..

If the cruise missiles were used to attack that airbase specifically

The claim is an air strike, not a cruise missile strike..

then the "depot" of chemical weapons was also on that government controlled airbase?

So no..

<TEXT>  Immigrants from outside the EU are a different matter. Most people in the world don't have a chance of ever emigrating to the West.

The point is that EU residents are currently applying for things they don't actually need, under routes geared toward non-EU residents. So it's not really a different matter, it's the same process.

We are talking about free movement in the EU, and that hasn't suddenly changed after the referendum. As long as the UK is part of the EU, EU citizens shouldn't have to worry about the rights they have always taken for granted.

They don't have to, as long as the UK is in the EU. The people in this article (and the UK citizens in other EU countries..) are concerned about what happens when the UK leaves and they no longer have those rights. Nothing has changed yet for them, they are trying to secure their rights beyond the UK exit, and there isn't currently a process designed for that.  It's not like they are being denied any of the treaty rights they are entitled to.

Is it just incompetence on the part of the Home Office? Or is there a directive from the top to make life hard for EU citizens? 

To be fair, it isn't even really incompetence, it's essentially a hostile process. You are responsible for meeting the requirements and proving them, if you don't and are denied (As in this case) that isn't incompetence, it just isn't particularly helpful.  

I can't of course tell, but I don't believe that lower rank bureaucrats decide these things on their own.

The decisions are made by individual immigration officers based on the operational guidance that is derived from legislation, as far as I am aware (and I know quite a few people who do that work at various levels, and a few immigration lawyers to boot..) there hasn't been any specific directive to make life hard for EU citizens, and if there were, it would be massively problematic for the UK government and the government would lose in court (and it would end up in court almost immediately). 

The notion that the UK would punish EU migrants is frankly laughable and utterly without basis. You'd be better off looking at how other, non-EU nationals fare through the same process, I'm willing to bet you won't find many differences (bar possibly that those people will have kept records and understood what is required in advance, and in many cases will have hired someone to help them through the process).

<TEXT> How much do you trust US as an ally? Especially with Trump?

In the context of NATO? As much as I'd trust anyone else, what is absolutely clear is that the EU as a grouping couldn't replace the loss of capacity or capability, nor recreate the strategic depth that the US offers...

The EU isn't a superpower, it isn't even a regional power right now, it needs to do a lot more to get there, and that means tight integration in areas of defence and foreign policy if it wants to be able to defend itself and protect its interests.  It's not there though, not even in terms of support from EU members. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a lot of these, and I think it highlights just how aggressive the Home Office is when it comes to immigration, naturalisation and residency etc.. Which should be seen as problematic (I mean yeah, have strict rules and apply them, but don't be an arse about technicalities either, it should be reasonably to complete paperwork, have error's queried and so on so that people with the right to something can get it, rather than just being rejected on essentially administrative grounds, especially since people are paying for the service..).

That said, I think what this does highlight is that in the context of EU citizens, where none of this has really been relevant before, the government hasn't put anything in place yet to deal with their special situation, and it should.  I mean granted, we don't have any settlement on the issue of EU citizens in the UK or UK citizens in Europe (and that's an issue for both the EU and the UK..), but you'd think people would have been able to think ahead a little bit.  

It's really quite shitty to see this happen when the rules seem to be in favour of the applicant, and the process is getting in the way.

What I will say is that I have seen issues in other EU countries (Germany and France as it happens), but more for non-EU citizens than EU citizens. It's just being focused on the UK at the moment because there are about to be a lot of people who have had no need to have any contact with government about their residency or status up until now, and often who haven't really been concerned about the rules that do exist and weren't particularly tightly enforced, having do to so now.

Just for context, I had some friends who decided to go for German nationality fairly recently (been in Germany for a long time, have kids that went through German schools etc..) who had everything go through for half the family, but not the other half, and are now messing about, 6 months later trying to find out what has gone wrong and how to fix it (something about different surnames being processed by different offices etc..).

Hope it gets sorted out here sharpish though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Batteries are cheap

They are, but you do have to change them out, and better, larger ones are more expensive, you need spares to charge whilst you are using some and they only have a certain life span etc.. 

Coils are arguably more expensive, although you can refurbish them, but then there is a time and convenience cost.

If you are throwing in the cost of papers (which you get 'free' with some baccy brands now) and filters, which are so cheap it's hilarious you can't discount batteries, chargers, coils and so on. </TEXT>

I don't think he will, not if he's speaking to people on the UK side, which he and his advisers will be.  I'd also expect the UK to (quite sensible..) reiterate that using secret material in court would harm intelligence gathering and cooperation etc.. Unless someone in the UK government actually starts pointing at this or using it in the context of the US, he's not going to go out of his way to take it as a political attack or highlight it.. There is nothing to gain for him and even as enamoured as he appears to be of the occasional hissy fit about intelligence gathering, he doesn't seem to hang that on governments, if anything if you take how he looks at his own intelligence agencies, he'll be more likely to separate the two.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It does, but you can draw a line under weapon types (rather than impact), we have a pretty good definition and grouping when it comes to NBC weapons (so nuclear, biological and chemical) as well as a long term understanding of their impact in warfare and on non-combatants. There are also reasonably well understood policies in place about the use of such weapons extraterritoriality at least, as well as understood consequences.

The problem with propaganda and potential false equivalence in this context really is a huge one though. Using the claimed or actual use of chemical weapons, to justify a preexisting policy that has essentially nothing to do with either removing the ability of someone to use them is massively problematic and starts to look like a repeat of previous scenarios.  The problem there then obviously becomes that the chemical weapon issue doesn't actually get resolved, and any trust and credibility is lost..

Syria is a mess and no-one seems interested in actually dealing with that issue and far more focused on regional politics and power, but not enough to make a strong intervention, or allow anyone else to either. </TEXT>

That's one of the reasons Chemical (and biological/nuclear..) weapons are seen as distinct, even though you can do quite a lot of damage with conventional weapons and other terror tactics. </TEXT>

Ha, same here mostly now, yay for us..

how ever alot of smokers ive seen (not all) that stand in groups or sit outside coffee shops just blow it in any direction with out thinking, vapor has no harsh chemicals just (some) nice smells and water vapour

True, although some of the tobacco flavoured ones are pretty awful as smells, and some of the more artificial smelling flavours have a chemical tinge, although they are just flavourings and water, so it's not like second hand smoke.  It can be pretty unpleasant though.. Although there was one guy in Manchester with a really 'fresh apple' smelling vape, had to ask him what it was (turned out it was home brewed and as it turned out, didn't taste as nice as it smelled..).

As a side note, has anyone else noticed the almost 'curry' tinge in some of the cheap liquids? That's actively nasty.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I bounced around a bit too (and yeah, started with the awful fake fags..), payed around with the sub-ohm stuff and dripping.. and then ended up preferring the 1.8 ohm coils, an air flow addon and a decent sized tank with a not too huge battery pack. TBH the airflow control makes the most difference and anything above the 1.8 seems to offer too much resistance, whilst anything below seems to offer little in the way of flavour and mostly just burns through juice..  

As a comparison to 'normal' smoking (which I haven't done for about 2 years.. yay me) I think the amount of vapour I put out now is about equivalent to, maybe a little less than from a rolled cig, although obviously less persistent, but it certainly isn't the steam train approach quite a few people are going for (and are amusing to see in cars on occasion...).

That said, it's a personal preference thing.

Although if you are smoking bubblegum flavoured, super strong vape it has an impact on people around you too (and I say that as someone with a preference for vanilla liquids..).  </TEXT>

Yeah, it's cheaper than tobacco and has been for a long time, but you go through massively more liquid if you produce a lot of vapour in my experience, so a bottle that'd cost you 7 or around that will last a few days rather than a week and a bit or more..

Add on papers and filters and it is a lot more economically viable.

I'd assume it is intended to suggest that the chemical attack from last week was not a government attack (a lot of the arguments seem to be that the Syrian government is the only group capable of launching such an attack if that isn't the case, you'd need to also look at who else could have, or would have wanted to carry out such an attack..).

It sort of broadly lines up with what the Russians are saying now in terms of evidence,  and so on, and frankly without external, independent verification it's all a bit of a shit show.  </TEXT>

No.. There isn't... Or rather if there is, I'd love to see it because I haven't heard of it before.

I assume you are actually talking about the footage of the Lee Rigby attack in London, in which case you have footage of unarmed officers not approaching suspects (but essentially containing them) after they had attacked and killed Lee Rigby (first with a car, then a knife), and then armed police arriving and wounding both suspects.  It's worth noting that had the first officers on the scene been armed, it wouldn't have prevented the attack given that the two killers struck their victim with a car and then attacked him with knives well before the police were even notified..

<TEXT> I don't know how hacking a site that helps people register would benefit any foreign nation, but I'm not an expert.

It wouldn't, unless they did it all the time and prevented a large number of people from registering, and even then it wouldn't really work (because most people are registered to vote anyway, and you get a letter regularly to keep that up to date that you post back...) and would be far more obvious and difficult than taking a site down for a few hours.

I'm probably a bit paranoid to be honest and the news about the Russians hacking the US elections don't help.

To be fair, the 'hacking' the US elections' essentially comes down to spreading disinformation and releasing information about candidates from hacked computer systems. It wasn't hacking in the sense that anyone interfered with the electoral count or registration. </TEXT>

I'm confused as to how voter registration would allow 'Russian (or Chinese, American, German...) hackers change what the people voted' though. It literally just allows you to register to vote (which you can do in other ways too..), it doesn't change what people vote for, impact the result or do anything else really.. 

Having a clean democracy it's worth our time and effort, imo.

Indeed, and having a site to allow people to register helps that rather than preventing it.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And here's the rub. In my view, a valuable skill is something that results in the holder working in a productive industry. You appear to think a valuable skill is some sort airy holistic "knowledge for knowledge's sake". I disagree - such pursuits are a luxury, and should not be the burden of the general taxpayer to afford.

Yeah, that's the disagreement, I don't think that skills and knowledge directly related to productive industry are valuable.  I can see the argument that some doing basic research in things like ancient Germanic languages can be beneficial in it's contribution to linguistics, and whilst it might not leave the person doing the studying with many prospects outside of academia, I'd argue that it is still beneficial (And may even provide a basis for some economic activity..). Essentially I don't see anything wrong with academic pursuits as long as they are actually exceptional.

We should be pushing more people through tertiary education, but that tertiary education should take a reformed approach. It should be spread across your lifetime; it should be bite-sized; it should be practical for economic ends; it should be part time. 40,000 spread across a 25 year career is 1,600 a year - that's a lot of courses, training material and certificates.

I'd mostly agree with you there, at least in part. I think there should be more focus on development and vocational training support for people, rather than narrowly trying to push people through university and an academic approach.  I mean, the opposite is currently happening (my eldest kid's school just dropped engineering because of cost concerns, so now we are looking at alternative.. you'd think that kind of thing would be important, but apparently not..).  Apprenticeships should be about real skills too, not a reduced income job that happens to provide qualifications in things that most people can do after a couple of hours of training, and do well after a few weeks of supervision..

The degree, as a pure academic pursuit should be the reserve of the few, genuinely brilliant. I could fully get behind comprehensive public funding of scholarships for such degrees, if only a few brilliant percent of people were entitled to them.

That's what I'd be aiming for (although brilliant may well be somewhat subjective), I'd certainly expect a smaller proportion than now to attend, and I'd hope that there would be equality of opportunity for those suited to and genuinely capable of advancing our understanding of.. stuff.

But I'd include musicians, artists and so on alongside engineers, scientists and mathematicians etc.. in that grouping.

<TEXT>  He said the stupidity of the eurozones structure meant that the entire european project was structured to fail.

This is sort of the thing with quite a few EU projects, but I'd argue that they aren't structured to fail because people want them to fail, they are structured so that further integration that isn't possible initially and politically unpopular, becomes necessary and so the political pressures are reduced.  That doesn't seem to be happening in a number of areas though, so the EU and Eurozone are finding it much harder to carry out the reforms that they want..  Now that might simplify a little once the UK leaves, but this, and other positions (coming from the likes of Denmark, the Netherlands, the V4 and others) aren't going to simply disappear either.

It's arguably crisis based policy pushing, and I think it's really quite problematic in that it harms the perception of EU programmes and projects in the view of the public, and creates fuel for euroscepticism where there isn't actually a need for it.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of that is predicated upon having a wealthy tax-base to pay for such expenses.

Not really,  higher education isn't *that* expensive in the first place, shifting the cost on to a smaller group of people (graduates or students..) arguably relies more on having that group be able to pay given you'd be pushing the burden across a smaller population..

If every Tom, Dick and Harry can rack up bills for 40,000-50,000 on Underwater Wanking Science Studies, then it does nothing to improve the wealth of the tax base and becomes an extravagant expense.

Right, but what about if you have fewer people going to university for academically rigorous courses, rather than trying to push everyone through university by default? I have very little issue with people going to university purely to advance or understanding of things, whether it's science, engineering or art and music, I have far more of an issue with lots of people doing degrees they will get no benefit from because it is seen as something you have to do..

Do you think a poor country like Chad should be putting upwards of 2/3rds of its young people through tens of thousands of pounds worth of tertiary education in non-economically productive studies?

No, but it should be pushing it's best and brightest to go through tertiary education (Whether that is in economically productive studies or not) and pay for that if it can... Although priorities for countries are somewhat different depending on the issues they face too.

Why then should a wealthy country engage in such pursuits? Because we are wealthy? Well, that would come to a finish if we continue such opulent displays of endebting our future.

Having good higher education, that produces both academic and economic benefits is a positive thing for the country though, it becomes a problem when it ceases to provide value, when people are essentially paying a lot of money for a piece of paper, rather than for a set of valuable skills. </TEXT>

Now no doubt the US has other issues to deal with in terms of threats, especially given the prevalence of firearms, but there must be a mid-way point between an immediate response from a SWAT team and two unarmed police officers having a chat.  

And as you point out, the amount of force used when they do enter the situation is the police's responsibility, and it should be both reasonable and proportional..

In either case, the person making the call and the police have some responsibility, the police for their actions, and the callers for wasting police time and creating a potentially dangerous situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  My understanding is, they are also trying to change a law that means calling in a SWAT team is equatable to the use of deadly weapon, which I can easily understand. 

Sort of (although I think it'd be hard to get people outside of the US to see that as valid, as there tend to be somewhat tighter rules of engagement for the police, not that that always prevents issues, but it mostly does..) I'd be worried that that shifts the blame away from the police and their responsibility to use reasonable force though..  SWAT teams aren't a weapon after all, they have the ability to make decisions on how much force is appropriate and so on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hacking seems to mean pretty much anything you want it to mean these days, but a lot of people would probably still assume an intrusion if you are talking about a a site being hacked, rather than a service interruption..

All of the above are security issues though, and frankly if we are talking about media reports, anything related to a computer can be referred to as hacking without it raising many eyebrows..  </TEXT>

To be fair to whoever was running the IT, it's hard and expensive (and so hard to justify..) to have a platform that can deal with a massive surge of traffic that is significantly higher than normal.

<TEXT> I'm 100% confident we could destroy any Chinese launch.

There is almost no chance that the US would be able to defend against even a small launch from China or Russia because you'd be talking about an enemy capable of launching quite a few missiles, with quite a few modern, manoeuvrable warheads per missile, and incorporating penetration aids and decoys etc.. The various elements of the US missile defence system are great, but they don't come close to offering anything approaching blanket protection against ICBMs, in fact what there is is not really geared toward intercepting large numbers of modern ICBM's and has a low success rate against simpler targets...

Don't get me wrong, what the US has achieved is phenomenal, but it's a very long way away from being able to defend well against a modern threat.

It might however be quite successful against a launch from North Korea given you'd likely be talking about a vastly simpler threat.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You also have to realise that missile (s) will need to make it past the 2 largest airforces in the world, cutting edge experimental weaponry that can be deployed almost instantly from Camp Pendleton and the Naval bases in CA, and the largest Navy that has ever existed.

To be fair, it isn't really about the size of the air forces if you are talking about an ICBM, fighters and bombers aren't really relevant. The question would be whether US missile defence systems work against ballistic warheads, which is still questionable, but more likely against NK given the assumption that they are going to use a limited number of missiles with nothing complex in terms of anti-missile-defence capabilities.

If it were a few Russian or Chinese missiles, the US couldn't prevent a strike but with North Korea it's more likely, and will depend heavily on a huge range of factors.

That said, if it were to happen, the response would be pretty immediate and final for North Korea... </TEXT>

<TEXT> The government have no incentive to implement the kind of reforms you're talking about, because high university attendance masks youth unemployment figures. 

The incentive should be decent higher education, but again, I agree. We now essentially have mandatory education until 18, and an expectation that most people won't even attempt to enter the workforce until several years after that. It seems to be something of a trend to keep people in a strange in between category (not quite adults, not quite children) for a long time, and justifies things like reduced benefit and support availability, and reduced minimum wage brackets, and indeed apprenticeship pay rates...).

Not sure how sustainable all that is, or whether it'd be attractive to governments of all stripes, but it certainly isn't a good reason to support it.

It also gets young people into a lot of debt, which helps to prop up the student loans industry.

I'm not sure this is terribly accurate (they had to creat it and it'll make huge losses, but it does shove the costs off the balance sheet and create apparent liabilities owed to the government, so there is that, although it is a long way down the road, and some other government will have to deal with the fallout.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> no it doesn't. cars manage this all the time on residential roads.

To be fair, if I do it in my car, the drivers around me are still aware of where I am and won't suddenly pass me on the off chance that they can, I am not taking myself out of a lane that I would have to later re-enter against traffic that is passing and coming from behind me, so it's almost an entirely different scenario.  The risk to the cyclist is that they nip in and out, and someone doesn't see them or assumes they have priority so they have to either stop or slow down, or they end up being hit by a car.

Frankly when driving I'd much rather have a cyclist act in a predictable manner and hold their road position than nip in and out of gaps.  Granted there are situations where a cyclist may actively have to move out of the way to allow traffic to pass, but that's not really the issue most of the time, and it doesn't seem to be here given it's a two lane road.  At that point to give a cyclist a sensible amount of room, you essentially need to treat them as another car anyway (hell, most of the time you want to do that, otherwise you are either forcing them to drive at the curb, which can be nightmarish for cyclists, next to parked cars, which can be problematic, or you are passing them unsafely anyway..).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well you kind of answered your first paragraph in your second. I'd be livid, as it stands, if my taxes paid for people to go to university. At least half, if not more, of uni students sit around for 90% of the year doing nothing except getting drunk. Why should I pay for that?

You may or may not be more livid by my edit then....

But my answer would be that university should be hard to get into, and then paid for.  It shouldn't be something that everyone does by default, and where we try and throw as many people through the system as possible, so not so much about learning or education or furthering a field, but about having attended and gotten a piece of paper. 

I'd absolutely welcome funding a university system that delivers great education to people who can benefit from it, from taxation. I have a problem with pushing almost everyone through university, regardless of whether their degree will be useful, or is valuable,  essentially for the sake of it regardless of how we pay for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A graduate tax sounds like a far more straightforwards way of handling the whole system.

Or we could just fund it through the tax system, I really don't see the issue in a system with progressive taxation. Earn more because of your degree, pay more taxes, earn more because you can employ well educated people, pay more taxes, etc.. Education is something that should benefit society, so we should pay for it.

The problem I have right now is actually more with the direction we are going with university education generally, it is becoming essential for everyone not because people need a university education, or university education is particularly relevant to a lot of jobs, but because there has been a massive push to get people into university. I'd rather that were spread more across vocational and in work training and getting people into work that offers a career when they leave school, as well as having university push people into academia and research... Low level management doesn't and shouldn't require a degree, nor should a whole slew of jobs that up until recently were broadly vocational for the majority (with some people taking the degree route and going into research..).

*edit: Just realised I sort of missed the other side of my argument.. - I also don't think university should just be about jobs or about what you can earn with a given degree. I would prefer university to be an option for talented musicians and artists, for social scientists and people with an interest in the humanities and media, and that people can learn and develop for the sake of learning, not because they feel they have to, to be able to compete for work that doesn't have any relevancy to their degree anyway.*

<TEXT> The idea of having 40k-ish student debt at an interest rate of 6.1% is frankly terrifying. That's like 200ish a month in interest alone...

I have to say, I really dislike student loans, and right now if you look at the numbers there really isn't much positive to say.  Although given the repayment thresholds and the interest rate, it starts looking more like a graduate tax anyway.  My back of a fag packet maths would suggest that you'd have to earn more than 45k/pa just to hit a the point where you repay the interest a 40k loan would accumulate, so you'd essentially be paying forever at that point or lower (well, unless your income drops below 21000, at which point you wouldn't repay anything..). </TEXT>

<TITLE> Duplicate url search return inconsistencies. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-11 19:13:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> OK, so I think I've come across this a couple of times, so I assume it's not new, but this gives a little more clarity as I had someone else available to confirm inconsistent results..

The bug is essentially not finding other submissions of the same url (not just the same article, but an identical url) within a specific subreddit, leading to duplicate submissions.

It also means that different users are getting different search results, hours after a submission, when searching by url.

Steps that are repeatable with the url in this report, and in /r/europe (haven't tried anywhere else..)

0) Someone else submits the story I'm will go to search for and submit later, it appears, isn't deleted or otherwise subject to moderation (I checked with the subreddit mods..) but doesn't show up in search results when searching for the url.

1) I then search globally and within a subreddit to see if a url has been submitted (url in question most recently was: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39437388). 

*Global search returns results of the same submission to other subreddits, but not in the specific subreddit I'm looking to submit to.*

2) Go to the subreddit I want to submit to, search on the url, 

*The search returns no results within the subreddit and shifts to submit (so no, 'Post it again').*

3) Submit the article.

*The article submits as normal.  On the submitted article, the other discussions show other submissions in other subreddits ([see here](http://imgur.com/a/SixRk)) but not the first submission (step 0)*

4) A user suspects that the post is a duplicate, but can't by searching by the url, find the original.

5) I search by the title rather than url and it does find the submission to the same subreddit.  Still can't find it by url (but my submission is returned).

6) Some time later, both submissions are returned by search to the user at stage 4 (not me) on the same subreddit.

Obviously this is part of the search stuff, so I'm aware there are issues, but.. there you go anyway.  I think, but can't prove, that I've seen the same on /r/politics and  /r/worldnews and I think on /r/news, so I don't think it's sub specific (and wouldn't expect it to be..).

Other notes:

I deleted my submission to /r/europe (after notifying the mods it's a dupe, and after the above) to check if I could resubmit it without it being a duplicate and initially I could, now I can't.. So again, an inconsistency.

Anyway, there you go, cheers. </TEXT>

As I understand it it does, but I think I am right in saying that it's perfectly good at matching urls (people masking them by adding shite to the end of a url being a different issue, and doesn't seem to be the case here..) so it'd be worth seeing if there is something specific going on, and these url's happen to be fairly clean so it'd be a good bug report if nothing else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the issue you're talking about only becomes salient if we're actually going to make policy.

It's salient that dealing with criminality is different from dealing with acts that are legal and can be positive or negative. It means you have different considerations and a different responsible party (the individual company or person for criminality, and the government for policy).  

 It's very easy to say that you only want to get rid of the bad tax avoidance, but it's not easy at all to make it any more concrete than that.

Sort of, various countries have started adding descriptive rules to tax policy (so they state why a rule is being implemented, so using it for something else is more obviously a breach of the rules) so it becomes easier to determine impact and potential for abuse without having to go into massive detail..  Still, you have to start somewhere.

That is why it took me so long to figure out what your point was.

To be fair, my point was simple enough, you can't treat evasion and fraud like avoidance. </TEXT>

No, someone said that tax evasion, tax fraud and tax avoidance were morally equivalent.. That's a bit different.

And you refuse to accept that when people say "cat", they don't really mean "lion" until they either quit or continue the conversation on your terms, which I can't imagine serves any purpose other than really lame trolling or some weird ego-boosting exercise. Whatever the case, it's really transparent and really annoying.

Except of course I've also discussed the issues around avoidance with people and why those issues, and then the solutions aren't the same as those related to fraud or evasion.

This is really simple, people here are lumping three things together that have a negative impact (or can have in the case of avoidance) that need to be dealt with separately.  That's not pedantry, that's discussing the actual issues.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You may argue that your definition is better or even the only right one and you would be potentially justified in doing so, but right now you're just being wilfully obtuse.

I'm not though am I. The initial premise was that evasion, fraud and avoidance are the same ethically. They aren't, people evasion and fraud are criminal, avoidance isn't, and it takes many forms, some that people here would agree with, some that they don't.  If we start lumping them together, and taking 'avoidance' to mean 'things that I don't like about the tax system', we have a problem, because we are not talking about what those issues actually are and we are essentially throwing out a policy tool because governments sometimes don't use it terribly well.  We need to separate these issues because they require different approaches to solve, we can't do that if we lump them together, or if we misunderstand what they actually are.

Afford other people enough respect to engage with the substance of their arguments, even if you object to their wording. Otherwise you're just wasting everyone's time, including your own.

I am engaging with their arguments and not just one term though, the problem is the assumption that any tax benefit, credit or reduction is an abuse and that the scale of the issue is masked by not addressing the specificity.  You will note that I had a very productive conversation with /u/WhyYouShouldCare that resulted in a far clearer and more reasoned conclusion than simply 'fuck tax avoidance', that is the point of having the discussion isn't it? If people think avoidance, evasion and fraud are pretty much the same thing we have a problem, because avoidance is useful to society and anyone that looks at tax incentives when making a decision.

<TEXT> But I still think it will only work if we work on all three issues at the same time. So I think it is very good they name all of them in one breath. We need to attack on those fronts at the national level, within the EU, and probably also abroad to the extent that we can manage. With improved laws and new enforcement mechanisms we can do more to make everyone pay their fair share. I hope that doesn't lump them together too much for you.

To be honest I'd actually like to see the legislative aspect of avoidance being dealt with first (either through simplification or simply a review..), that way you would hopefully improve the success rate of your enforcement agencies when it comes to evasion and fraud, although that might throw up other issues around dealing with 'legacy' offences in the previous system.

I hope that doesn't lump them together too much for you.

No it doesn't, it separates two distinct issues as things that require different solutions quite nicely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> the "bad" avoidance is easily understood as"respecting the letter of the law but not the intent" even though legally it's quite hard to define

It's not even that easily understood and someones view on a particular policy will change how people say it (tax relief on investment? Giveaway to the bankers, tax relief on mortgages, giveaway to homeowners etc..). There are some aspects that are more universal (like arrangements where you are legally offshoring profits..) but the point is that avoidance covers a huge range of things, if you include it in a figure, you'd better specify what is included.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Claiming deductions and tax credits as envisioned by the lawmaker is not what would be considered tax avoidance in the context of this video.

No, but that is what tax avoidance is.  The poster I replied to suggested that evasion, fraud and avoidance were ethically equivalent they aren't. 

The problems are also different, one is people acting illegally, the second would be issues around how governments legislate.

Under your definition, having a child and receiving a tax credit for that child is a form of tax avoidance, which, I'm not going to argue is not a possible definition, but it clearly isn't the definition used by anyone else in this conversation, so you're just arguing past everyone else.

It is however the actual definition of tax avoidance.  Moreover, people in this conversation and elsewhere are actually using avoidance to mean 'things we don't like', which then gets hard to pin down.  It also makes the figures involved horribly suspect when you include legal tax reduction, without defining what the hell that means, 1tn Euro's would represent 1/6^th of all taxation within the EU, at all levels, but I can't find a breakdown of what is avoidance and what is evasion and fraud (it also doesn't help that figures for things like VAT loss to the EU include loss due to evasion, avoidance, bankruptcies, insolvencies and miscalculation)..

Claiming that avoidance is ethically the same as fraud or evasion is simply not accurate and really quite problematic in the context of the debate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, if I were happy with the law then I would be.

Right..

So, we deal with evasion and fraud by using the law enforcement agencies we have and work to detect and prosecute criminality.. But when it comes to avoidance, it is not about stopping it, but making sure that governments do not take the piss when they write tax laws, it's essentially something you argue for or against (like the shape, scale and type of welfare payments or defence policy etc..) rather than fight against generally.

So lumping them all together is problematic, because you end up in a position where people equate evasion, with fraud and with avoidance (often whilst technically engaging in the latter to some degree).

I just think that much of the underpaid tax comes from people being able to abuse tax law that was poorly written or implement, if it isn't just out of date. 

Agreed, and that needs to be changed so that it reflects what governments and people want, there are also some balances to be met (arguments about certain tax offers that are current, but will depend on your view of their effectiveness and ongoing necessity for example).

So if we're going to bring the amount people pay into balance with the amount we as a society want them to pay, then we should move on all fronts at the same time. Not just by fighting what is criminal, but also by closing the loopholes that allow people to hide entire fortunes from the taxman.

Right, but they are very different things and shouldn't be lumped together because it misleads.  You can't include tax evasion, fraud and avoidance in the same figure, because the amount that is 'lost' on avoidance, isn't necessarily lost and much of it will be intentional.   It'd be a bit like reporting a total for the number of people who speed, to include everyone who has driven over 50mph, regardless of the speed limit where they were driving.. It'd inflate the number. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Let me use an analogy. In my house I have ants and worms. I want to solve this problem by fumigating the place with gas to poison them.

Your analogy doesn't really make any sense does it, it basically says, there are a load of things I want to kill, so I'll kill them.  Which is great and your prerogative, what I am saying is that when you justify killing both the ants and the worms because they bite then you have a problem, because worms don't.

 I say let's have less of all three, evasion, avoidance, fraud, as they constitute going against the will of the people to have a fairly distributed tax burden. You keep on saying that one isn't a crime and the others are. I don't see what that adds.

Fine, and great, but you still have to acknowledge that breaking the law to avoid paying taxes is very different from you not agreeing with the tax laws that someone is complying with. 

The question then would be, if you agreed entirely with every part of the tax legislation in your country, would you then be happy for people to ensure that they pay the amount required under the law and take advantage of any incentives and credits?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> you are pushing a bit of a false narrative meaning people aren't making an informed choice.

You missed a rather important part of that quote before responding..

**when you lump fraud and criminal evasion of taxes into the same bracket**, you are pushing a bit of a false narrative meaning people aren't making an informed choice. 

The parent suggested that tax evasion, tax fraud and tax avoidance were morally equivalent, they aren't, as you point out, there are good reasons to allow avoidance where that is fair and incentivizes good behaviour. 

Sometimes things become a crime, sometimes they don't.

Yes.... But if you are breaking the law, you aren't engaged in avoidance anymore, you are engaged in evasion. That is a crime and not the same thing...

If you keep on taking a subsidy after we have gotten rid of it, then perhaps we should have a closer look at how you got your hands on government money for example.

Absolutely, as you are engaging in tax evasion, not taking a subsidy (as it doesn't exist..).

<TEXT> It's not always a crime to contribute less than your fair share of the tax burden to society. 

The problem with your that position is that in terms of tax incentives, you would likely not be paying your fair share of the tax burden, but instead are spending money on something the government would have to spend tax money on (often more than what you would..). Take something like a tax credit for a hybrid, you'd be paying less than your fair share, but you are spending your money to aid the adoption of a technology. The alternatives would be a government subsidy to the manufacturers (actually, possibly not, because if it comes in the form of a tax incentive, it'd be more avoidance..) or you legislate to force people to adopt the new technology (which harms poor people..).

But that doesn't mean the rest of society can't have a problem with your behaviour, or that we shouldn't encourage our governments to do something about it.

Of course not, but when you lump fraud and criminal evasion of taxes into the same bracket, you are pushing a bit of a false narrative meaning people aren't making an informed choice.  I'd also argue that we should encourage our governments to make good policy choices, which would include incentivizing some activities through the tax system, largely because it's cheap and effective. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You need to change laws, as well as policy, and enforcement measures, all three together to fight anyone of these issues. Might as well do all of them in one swoop.

But why do you want to 'fight' people looking to minimise their taxes legally? You are essentially looking to remove a mechanism available to government to promote what the government deems as good behaviour..

Don't get me wrong, there can be abuse in that area, laws can be poor and so on, but that is a very different issue, with a very different culprit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In this case the desired outcome is a fair distribution of the tax burden. The means to improve that are to get rid of loopholes and tighten oversight.

Is that the desired outcome? To give a concrete example, there are lots of government schemes that reduce or even remove the tax paid on electric or hybrid cars, someone who chooses to buy such a car would be depriving the government of tax, they would be engaging in tax avoidance by making a choice in how they spend their money in the most tax advantageous manner...

Tax policy is not just there to ensure a fair distribution of the tax burden, it also allows you to incentivize good behaviours and disincentivize bad ones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The tension between tax policy and all three is the same. Those who wrote it wanted to distribute the burdens of our government spending fairly across society. Those who engage in any of those three are moving to contribute less than that agreed burden.

Except governments often use tax incentives to get companies to do things that they like, you get to avoid or reduce your taxes by doing something that the government wants doing, that is beneficial (hopefully..) to society.. Surely that still fits into that in terms of distributing burdens..

The solution is also the same, make it more difficult to engage in all three behaviors by tightening laws and strengthening oversight. So that we can surer that all contribute what we as a society have agreed on as being their fair share.


Two of them are illegal, the last one is a product of government policy, so I'm not sure how the approach is the same. Surely enforcing the law is what you need to do to fix evasion and fraud, and avoidance doesn't need fixing, although governments need to be held to account as to what they offer in terms of incentives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are lots of organisations who will make use of incentives to reduce their tax liability, the government uses policy to try and push companies to do things they like, if you you are including that in the mix, then it inflates the issues and is actually misleading. Wold my company do something morally wrong  by taking advantage of the enhanced Capital Allowances, or business renovation allowances? I'd argue no.  

When you try and lump together evasion, fraud and avoidance, that is misleading, not least because it means that you are blaming people and companies for government tax policies (so, the wrong target..) and lumping positive elements in with illegality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No.. They really aren't. Tax fraud and tax evasion involve actively avoiding paying tax that you owe. Tax avoidance is about minimising tax within the law, that would include things like taking advantage of government policy that reduces tax liability for good behaviour (say, reducing carbon emissions,  installing better solar installations or investing in R D or apprenticeships). That isn't the same morally or legally.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah yes, the old, "If it's not broke don't fix it" fallacy. 

It's not a fallacy, but you do have to be aware what 'broke' means

you are spending a fortune on maintenance and downtime while you look for parts

That generally justifies an upgrade, when it costs more to run whatever you are running, than running an upgraded version, it's broken..

plus now it's a security nightmare

That also constitutes broken, although old doesn't always mean insecure, depends on the system and the threats

It will fucking break for good at some point and you'll be running around in panic mode for weeks or months and losing more money in the process.

And that's the drama you want to avoid.. 

It's basically balancing the impact of upgrades vs the impact of not upgrading, it can swing massively in both directions depending on the culture of the organisation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thought I'd post this because it's interesting watching the redefinition..

The ~~byline~~ subheading alone is somewhat telling - *If what you mean by Brexit is the UK severing all ties to the EU to reclaim our sovereignty and take back control of our borders, then it isnt likely at all*

The idea that the UK has to sever all ties, and take some extreme position on everything in relation to the EU seems to be becoming more common, but it broadly doesn't seem to be coming from the bulk of people who voted leave.

Now granted the article does a bit to refight the referendum and immediate aftermath:

*The problem is that often when people talk about leaving the EU they confuse it with leaving the EEA (European Economic Area) and its single market  but not all EEA states are in the EU. It may be possible for the UK to leave the EU but remain in the EEA and follow the Norway model, an option many people think is preferable.*

I think the various conflicts that leaving the EU but remaining in the EEA have already been broadly discussed, and indeed the government has been somewhat clear on both leaving the single movement, and the customs union, it seems unlikely that the UK would want to, or will follow anything that looks like the Norwegian model..

And then we finish with:

The Government has much to answer for. The sooner it acknowledges the realities, the better.

Which I'd agree with, acknowledging the reality of the situation is probably a good idea..

*Edit:: Sigh...*

<TEXT> If you're using experienced and top notch creatives for non-brand related IP (not logos, logomarks) you're always going to win doing a licensing deal.

Indeed, even if you aren't using experienced and top notch creatives you can buy in licensed material (and have access to a wealth of other royalty free or permissively licensed material for that matter) for far less than you can commission it.

The experienced people understand the value of giving up their control and ownership of the IP. They are likely to ask for a very high premium to do so.

Sort of depends on what they are providing, some things yes, some things no, most of the time it's a mixed bag (they don't want you coming after them for what you perceive are derivative works of something they provided for you and won't want to sell you something that limits future profitability, but if you are after a bespoke product that's generally a different issue). And in any case, always read the contract..

If something turns out to be iconic, focus your efforts on re-upping that license. You're still able to protect your brand and you're not burning through capital under the false notion of everything needing to be forever yours.

It only hurts you to do buyouts on EVERYTHING. If something turns out to be iconic...

If something you are licensing turns out to be iconic and it isn't yours, you are in the shit either way. The owner is going to look to maximise their return and your costs will rise, essentially anything strongly related to your brand you need to either own, or have a perpetual license with minimal royalties (can't do that with everything of course if we are looking at IP beyond imagery).

I'd argue that a good balance is that you own your brand, but don't kill yourself in terms of capital investment in getting that sorted, everything else matters far less (especially campaign material, stock imagery etc..). </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've tried looking at the various VCDS resources, tried searching, but between the various different terminologies, and mixing 'lights' with lit up and indeed illuminated I'm getting nowhere..

To describe what my issue is  - My 2003 Touran has a hazard light button nice and obviously on the dash, it lights up briefly when you turn on the lights and then goes out (at the same time as the lights around the light selector).  That hasn't really been a problem except when I would have liked to use it a little while back on a dark stretch of motorway, with it not being lit up I couldn't find it to hit it (nor could the passenger). If it were lit up all the time (and I note that it only glows dimly initially..) it would have been far easier to find..

Anyone have any ideas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> For stock material and things like site theming I'd agree. For more specific branding you are almost certainly going to need some bespoke work anyway (at which point there is often little to no value to the designer in licensing..) and the price differences become negligible. Depends on what the OP means by 'I outsource most of the graphic design work' too, although I assume he's not outsourcing his product for example.

Oh and it can be a pain in the backside dealing with licensing generally for a small startup, and cheap enough to get 'good enough' design work done without it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In fact, I would argue YOU NEVER NEED to own design work forever as an early stage startup.

It's a bit here and there, you probably should own the artwork, but you'll want to be able to change it and mess about with it as you figure out what your brand is, so don't invest a huge amount of money or emotion into any particular design in the early stages. What you don't want to do is associate yourself with certain imagery and then open yourself up to liabilities because it turns out someone scraped a logo, imagery or other design elements from someone who is willing to take you to court. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In terms of ownership, it would depend on the agreement you have with the freelancer doing the work.  That said, the [upwork T C's ](https://www.upwork.com/legal/), specifically section 8.6 Intellectual Property  Rights, make it clear that you as the client become the owner or any work created for the client by the freelancer:

*Upon Freelancers receipt of full payment from Client, the Work Product, including without limitation all Intellectual Property Rights in the Work Product, will be the sole and exclusive property of Client, and Client will be deemed to be the author thereof. If Freelancer has any Intellectual Property Rights to the Work Product that are not owned by Client upon Freelancers receipt of payment from Client, Freelancer hereby automatically irrevocably assigns to Client all right, title and interest worldwide in and to such Intellectual Property Rights. Except as set forth above, Freelancer retains no rights to use, and will not challenge the validity of Clients ownership in, such Intellectual Property Rights. Freelancer hereby waives any moral rights, rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal or inalienable rights under applicable law in and to the Work Product. If payment is made only for partial delivery of Work Product, the assignment described herein applies only to the portion of Work Product delivered.*

Of course that assumes a few things, most importantly that the freelancer has the right to assign ownership (if they used liberally licensed content they might not be able to..)...

So that seems to deal with both 1 and 2, as to three, if the above applies then you'd stop in the same way that you'd prevent anyone else from infringing on your copyrights, (that depends on jurisdiction, but broadly comes down to asking them not to, and taking them to court if they don't comply...).  

It all mostly hinges on whether they have the rights to pass on in the first place though, which they broadly should, but might not. Where they haven't they should be telling you what licenses the material they have used is subject to though.

<TEXT> Actually that's the common misconception. Modern developed western states are geared around welfare and services, that's where most of internal economic activity happens. You will always have a very high service sector in those countries, because that is what makes them what they are.

What you mean is that people spend more money on services, because people use a lot of services, whether that is getting your hair cut, your car fixed or eating in a restaurant..  Right.. But that proportion is similar between developed countries the UK doesn't have significantly lower manufacturing output when compared to comparable states as a result..

But when you talk about economy sectors in country comparisons you talk about producing stuff that is also at least potentially of interest to people abroad - wiping a grandmas ass in a retirement home isn't. It is economic activity ON TOP of what happens to make life in those countries work.

So for the UK, it happens to be very, very good at exporting financial and business services, as well as exporting goods. I mean the UK, as well as being in the top 7 globally for manufacturing output in terms of value, is also a top 10 exporting country.. 

Now if you said that the number of people employed in manufacturing had fallen you'd be absolutely right, it's fallen massively even whilst exports and production has risen, the same goes for agriculture by the way... 

In this context a difference of 9% of the total GDP is actually HUGE.

You mean between Germany and the UK right? What about Italy, with services at 75% of GDP, or the Netherlands at 80%...  Germany is a massive manufacturer and exporting country, it is the exception not the norm and the UK has a services sector only 9% larger, but of course the UK also exports far more in the way of services than Germany.

In any case, the idea that the UK *'has very little in terms of a producing goods economy left'* is bizarre under both assumptions, the UK went through a period of massively reducing it's heavy industry, which was frankly very damaging in my view, but it didn't get rid of manufacturing, it changed what it manufactured.  

For example,  why produce steel when Germany subsidised it's industry and produces it much more cheaply, same with China.. At that point you can buy steel to produce finished goods (cheaper inputs, no need to subsidise heavy industry and compete with China or Germany on steel exports..) or focus on specialist metallurgy instead (do something that China and Germany can't do - see the UKs unique position in the supply of materials to things like the US nuclear submarine programme..).   

The UK absolutely still produces goods and exports them, it produces a lot of goods for both export and domestic consumption, the idea that the UK doesn't produce anything anymore is a misconception based on a couple of strands (the reduction in heavy industry and the loss of mass employers through both automation and modernisation as well as competition) that don't actually lead to that as a conclusion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not to the extent of the UK.

Services make up 70% of the German economy, 79% of the US economy and 78% of the UK economy.. So yeah, to about the same extent. 

It has very little in terms of a producing goods economy left.

The UK has the 7th largest industrial sector globally by Nominal GDP. It produces quite a lot of goods, more high value and high tech than low tech and cheap, but that's not the same has not producing goods many goods.

That's should be common knowledge since it has been reported so many times.

<TEXT> Good question. You could argue that he wants to see EU citizenship become something independent of national citizenship, it might bolster the notion of an European identity grounded in the EU rather than as an add on to national identities. You could also argue that he is trying to use it as a lever in the context of the negotiations with the UK, there are a lot of people in the UK who would likely consider taking it up (probably depending on cost..). If you were being really cynical you might argue that he is looking to set a precedent in disconnecting national citizenship from the EU one, giving the EU a tool to allow people outside the EU to associate with it, even if their country more generally isn't looking to EU membership (so say Switzerland or Norway).

Or it might simply be the stated intention, he's looking for a way for UK citizens who want to retain EU citizenship a route to do so, or get close, presumably with some more restrictive rights and some sort of associated cost. </TEXT>

The answer is probably that this is a bit of a pipe dream, or that it'll mean very little in the end, but it's interesting nonetheless that it is being pushed as it is. </TEXT>

In the case of sodium fluoride it's incredibly common and added to drinking water and used in the production of a huge number of dental products, amongst other things.  As to potassium fluoride, it's used as a catalyst in the manufacture of plastics as well as pesticides and insecticides. That said, they are dual use, so I suppose if you suspect the customer, or someone else in the importing country will divert the chemicals for use in weapons, you do have a responsibility to prevent them being exported.

<TEXT> It all depends on whether or not a core group of countries can be found. If not, then not. There's little use in forcing people, it never works out in the long term.

You can't do it full stop frankly, force to push federalisation would do more to essentially destroy the political project than anything else.

Either they can be convinced in time, or we'll return to nation states without common rules.

Indeed, and to do that you have to have a clear aim and actually make the argument. At the moment (well, we saw it with the remain argument in the referendum in the UK) very few people will make an argument for eventual federalisation, even if it can be shown to provide benefits, because there isn't that EU identity, or common drive for it.

I still fully believe that even France and Germany cannot hope to seriously compete alone in the future. Neither economically, nor military-wise. Regional powers, maybe, but that's about it. In the end it all boils down to answering to greater powers and maybe being the regional hegemon serving their interests.

To be fair, the EU isn't going to be much more than a regional power either, even a federal state, especially one in which Germany has any stay in establishing, is going to shy away from seeking superpower status.  Germany and France can both be significant players on the global stage for the next century without much change, beyond that who knows (I mean if you look at the last few decades you had the Soviet Union collapse, the rise of China etc..).

Being a nuclear power is useless if greater powers decide the rules of the economy, the financial market, the stability of your neighbourhood, etc. What use was France's military in stopping the financial crisis which was due to US-led deregulation? What use was Germany's pacifism in stopping the Iraq invasion and the migrant crisis?

The point on making the rules is that it isn't something that can simply be imposed (Again, look at China..), it is something that works at the global level, very tentatively, through intergovernmental work.  Arguably Germany and France would have more individual say outside of the EU than having the EU speak for it.

As another example, look at military R D. The recent push for more EU-financed military R D also comes from the realisation that powers like the US simply have more resources they can focus to gain a technological edge.

The realisation that the US has been spending a huge amount of money for a long time and so has both breadth and depth when it comes to military capabilities and technology should also be a thing.. I mean look at Russia, it is essentially still relying on the spending and infrastructure provision it put in place as a superpower, if it didn't have that it'd be fairly insignificant militarily.

<TEXT> I don't believe in federalism. I view it as an added layer of complexity to governance compared to the nation-state model that has no reason to be there except to allow the leaders to have more influence on the world stage.

The problem is that for the EU to actually succeed as a political project, something akin to federalisation, certainly closer integration, is probably required.  That essentially provides something of a stark choice if you are asked whether you want to be part of the EU or not, do you want to be part of something that doesn't quite work and has to essentially fudge an extra layer on top of (or really at the same level of) national governments, or are you happy to go down the federalisation route which closes quite a lot of options and would create a formal 'top' layer.  Lots of people here seem happy with the latter, personally I think it's a great argument for those who don't want to be part of a federal EU to look at other options outside of it..

<TEXT>  I agree, which is why I am a EU federalist.  However, as a more pragmatic approach I do view integration of a core group as essential. I don't see it as too problematic, for one simple reason: the EU as it is now cannot endure. We either retreat back into EEC territory or push forward. If

One of those silly things really, I absolutely can see the benefits of federalism for the EU, in the very least of closer integration, but absolutely don't think the UK should be a part of that and I certainly don't want it for the UK, so it becomes an argument for leaving (ever closer union and integration is how you solve some of the EU's problems, if you don't want ever closer union, membership itself is problematic..). I do wonder what other countries would look at that in the same way, and what that leaves in terms of the core EU.  On balance it may still be more positive than not though..

 the EU as it is breaks down, it might even herald a core group to establish a more integrated, second attempt.

That's a more interesting question, I sort of wonder whether the big drivers that led to what is now the EU are still present enough to make that viable.  The argument that 'no single EU country can make it alone on the world stage', doesn't really apply to France especially or Germany either, there are undoubtedly benefits of union, but if you were starting from scratch, I wonder how many of them would actually be included..

<TEXT> This is and will likely remain one of the fundamentally different perceptions between (and I'm generalising a lot here but..) the likes of the US, UK, Canada etc.. and some of the core EU countries.  We both see the impact of the EU and NATO vary differently in terms of ensuring peace and slowly, that is morphing into the view that the EU would be better off without NATO.

You could argue that this then starts to mirror the notion that the EU fracturing is a threat to peace and stability (That is to say that NATO fracturing is absolutely a potential threat to peace and stability) but with people pushing for it anyway, largely because they see the argument as invalid and have their own theory. </TEXT>

As you point out, the mods trying to force a particular agenda one way or the other through censorship or similar simply won't achieve much (and is somewhat unhealthy anyway), and I'm not sure its desirable anyway.

It'll be interesting to see how the sub develops over time though, especially as opinions change and the user-base either turns over or simply ages, you might find it does start to more accurately reflect some of the views that are somewhat omitted (and to be fair, there tends to be more visibility for some fringe positions than you would find in any random sample of people of the same size across Europe..).

At the end of the day, it is somewhere where at present, there is significant pro-EU sentiment, but it isn't without people who take a different line, and that's not going away any time soon either. </TEXT>

If you change the power balance within the EU from the states to the people, or simply strengthen the EU, the EU becomes something different, that quite a few people (and potentially states) will see as problematic. You essentially have to either accept the possibility of the EU getting smaller but more integrated, remaining as it is, but still facing significant barriers to integration, or finding some third option (the multi-speed approach I suppose) that only half deals with the issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the issue is at least in part that criticism, and different views are sometimes seen as hate and responded to as though they were, on the other side of that, some people see the problems that the EU has as a reason to actively hate the project, often somewhat irrationally. 

The whole Brexit thing crystallised that really, you have a very small number of people in the UK (who are quite vocal..) who actively hate the EU, would like to see it crumble and collapse almost regardless and that taints the perceptions others have of the much larger group of people who do don't hate the EU, but would rather not be a part of it. Yes the assumption is that those who voted leave, hate the EU and those who voted remain are very positive about the EU. Of course the reality is that most people fall somewhere much closer to the middle...

It's a simplification, and people thrive on simplification, it allows you to mark the 'others' the people you are 'against' rather than consider what you actually have in common, and discuss and weigh up the issues at hand..  In short it's much easier to split people into those who hate the EU (who can criticise it etc..) and those who love the EU (who can't even allow criticism), than it is to deal with the complexities of reality. Which is a huge shame as it creates real barriers to both understanding, and for those who want to remain in the EU, the opportunity to find positive change that brings more people into their camp..

<TEXT> I'd actually argue he boxed himself in with the attacks on Obama over the 'red line'. At the moment the US president is doing a great number on being massively unpredictable and seemingly quite irrational in terms of the areas where he has actual executive power. Whilst I'm pretty sure the Russians wanted him elected, I'm still far from convinced that it has actually handed them any kind of control, but rather that as a President, Trump is essentially harming US foreign relations to the benefit of Russia by being somewhat incompetent and antagonistic towards his allies..

As to the unilateral action, again, I'd say that points to ego rather than anything Machiavellian.. On the one hand there is a President who is running into brick walls pretty head on, apparently deliberately, often for no good reason whatsoever, and on the other people are suggesting it's all well crafted toward a certain goal.. I'd say the Russians decided to shake things up and at this point may be wondering whether they can contain it. </TEXT>

Of course the US is going to warn the Russians, they had an agreement in place to do essentially that, and attacking Russian forces on the territory of a Russian ally whilst bombing an airfield would be pretty catastrophic and lead, somewhat justifiably to a major escalation, massively to the detriment of US interests. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think a huge number of leave voters are terribly keen to see the UK reversing the leaving process in the first place though.. If anything a decision that it could be reversed at any point would be a negative (both in negotiation terms and in a domestic political sense), it keeps the uncertainty about whether the UK is actually leaving rumbling on..  If anything a very small number of remain voters might be concerned if they thought it was likely to be reversed and so they still had the opportunity of re-fighting the referendum, rather than having to kick off an unpopular 'rejoin' campaign.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's probably the best case scenario, although it is one that depends heavily on viewing it through the lens of the current US political narrative. You do however have a major problem if that narrative is wrong or skewed excessively.

I wouldn't discount the idea that the US acted as it did because Trump wanted to be seen as resolute where Obama had been painted as weak, yes he informed the Russians before, but that doesn't suggest a coordinated approach. In that context, this response also makes sense, and it does mean that there are now more risks in both Russia and the US operating in Syria. If the next incident is a Russian shoot down of a US air strike you have one hell of an escalation..

People are assuming a level of coordination and cooperation between Russia and Trump, intended to press a particular political outcome, I'm not so sure that it isn't far more one sided than that and so far more dangerous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree but in my opinion is the right desicion for the EU population to decide in this way.

Quite possibly, but that argument has to be made to people in Europe, and at the moment, it really isn't, largely because it would boost euroscepticism and create more opposition than already exists..

 Imagine EU to fucntion like a real state with its own army. 

Yeah.. I see that as a bit of a problem, although less so now that the UK is leaving, and I do think closer integration is likely and probably necessary.

Im just citting some arguments that Merkel thinks too.

Sort of, based on what has been said in public she is certainly for further integration, but the detail there falls quite a long way short.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As long as the Anglosphere media is capable of portraying the euro as a project bound to fail because of political uncertainties in one of its members states, the euro will not achieve its full potential as a global reserve currency, to the detriment of all members.

To be fair, the EU is currently talking about requiring Euro clearing to be carried out within the Eurozone, that would also make it an anomaly and unhelpful in terms of global reputation for the Euro and potentially has an impact on its role as a global reserve currency..  In short, it's not just a media issue.

That said, the chances of Le Pen winning in France are incredibly small, and the chances of France leaving the EU and/or the Euro, even with Le Pen are small too (given the damage that could do very quickly to France, never mind the rest of the continent..).  We'll see what happens, but the whole Frexit scenario seems remarkably unlikely, even if the level of support for Le Pen is a little alarming in that context. </TEXT>

That was my run up to school this morning, on the way up it seemed like the lights weren't changing at all (sat for about 5 minutes before someone took the initiative and just went..) quite a lot of the  drivers were just going for it.. But it meant a lot of traffic on Walkley road down and South road back just sitting..

A lass who was walking up the road stopped, watched for a bit and then started directing the traffic, when I came back down again half an hour later, there was a chap doing the same thing, and he looked like he was handing or about to head off after I passed him.. So cheer if that was you anyway.

<TEXT> In terms of 'fake news' or rather a prevalent meme that isn't based on reality, this has to rank up there.. The US has troops in Eastern Europe, it's currently building up troop numbers in Europe rather after a significant period of reductions and it is doing so because of the perceived threat from Russia.. The US has made a lot of negative noises of late over funding, but it has also reaffirmed its commitment to NATO. That applies to the rest of NATO too, not one member has suggested it wants to cease cooperation, NATO has run and is running fairly major exercises, NATO members continue to inter-operate and share information...

 And your take on it is that NATO is dead and that there is no way 'Trump' would help e.g. Eastern European countries. I'm sure Russia is well pleased by the notion that people believe it, and would love to see it become a reality, but it isn't. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So if you ask 1000 people something, the outcome is concrete? 

No, but if you ask a selected group of 1000 people and weight the responses appropriately and produce an analysis of the responses, you can get a very good idea of what the general view is..

Nah, it's the opinion of a tiny fraction of society who are being compensated for filling out forms that people then take as gospel and use as "evidence" to fulfil their own beliefs. This is how we ended up with Brexit and Trump.

Firstly, you don't generally get compensated for completing a poll and the polling that was out there was pretty good in terms of Brexit and to a lesser degree Trump. The last big(ish) polling failure we had was the last General Election (which may be more appropriate to take into account here given the context) but frankly, it's no where near 'wrong' enough to turn this into anything other than a shit show.

You don't get Brexit and Trump because of polling outcomes, you get Brexit and Trump by not paying attention to polling and what people think, and instead think that twitter might be more accurate.

Corbyn is incredibly unpopular, even amongst labour voters, that seems pretty obvious both from polling and anecdotally.  Whether it's enough to put them off voting for a Labour councillor or MP is a slightly different question (although it seems rather clear that his leadership is having an impact there), but if you are suggesting that this data point, or the many that we have seen in the last while are simply wrong (and on the basis that polling is somehow generally wrong, and twitter more accurate..) are utterly incorrect, then you are essentially ignoring, rather than addresssing a fairly major problem.. </TEXT>

Populism is actually a massive opportunity for the Labour party, but were not capable of accessing it. My view about the rightwing populism is very, very clear. It can only be defeated by progressive forces building out from the centre.

I'd argue that the Blair government was elected on the basis of populism to a certain degree, it sought to address problems that a lot of people had that could be solved by policies that were, broadly, popular..

<TEXT> Think first poll post A50, surprised UKIP haven't gotten lower.

Same here, the party isn't looking to snappy, and their core issue (the one that presumably helped bring in moderate members from a variety of areas..) is essentially dead.  I was assuming we'd see a fairly major drop and UKIP having to shift focus, but so far that hasn't quite happened, and I'm not sure it's just the 'Don't let them reverse direction on leaving the EU' thing is the only driver..

The locals will be interesting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it goes poorly, then maybe, but I doubt it. They currently have a majority of 11, a shit brexit deal is unlikely to increase it.

I'm not sure it'd be that important a factor to be honest, a shit deal (and any deal is going to be called shit by some and great by others) will have less of an impact than the perception of competence and the ability to govern.. I'd love to see a swing toward policy perception, but without any confidence in the ability of a potential government to deliver it's all a bit academic </TEXT>

<TEXT> Currently 60% of UK trade is under EU treaties, either directly with the single market or via EU trade deals with third parties. 

Indeed, that's because competency to make trade deals currently rests with the EU.

While the UK can engage in informal talks any time it likes, it won't be possible to work out the details of any FTA until the future trade relationship with the EU has been determined.

It'd be a factor, but the real barrier is that the EU currently still holds the relevant competencies, and will until there is either an agreement between the UK and EU on how to move forward in the interim or indeed the UK leaves.

And even after that, the relationship with the single market will have an impact on UK trade with third parties.

That depends on the relationship. Outside of the Single market and the customs union whatever origin rules the UK and EU agree on will be relevant, but the EU won't be setting UK tariffs.. The EU obviously will be responsible for any tariffs that apply to the UK for UK/EU trade, but the UK isn't about to hand over tariff setting beyond what the WTO agreements are to the EU.

that would preclude a close relationship with the single market because the EU would have to protect itself against dumping through the backdoor.

Right.. And that applies to any country that the EU trades with.

It's an opinion on his part, putting aside that he's a bit of a dick,  he's probably right. I doubt the demographic shift are going to guarantee anything, there is more support for the EU amongst younger people, but I doubt that that is an entirely 'sticky' political view.  Then we have the issue of joining being a different argument to remaining, there was a lot of soft support on both sides of the argument, but I don't think even half the remain vote would push to join the EU, potentially under quite different circumstances in the near future.

<TEXT> I hadn't even considered this before, although I initially assumed it'd fall under Section 58(2) of the Firearms Act 1968 given you could argue that a canon would be a curiosity and so not subject to the provisions of the Act...  That it falls into the same area of regulation as shotguns really is a (really quite cool..) oddity.

Oh and the size limits are also interesting, we found a civil war canon ball a while ago with a diameter of around 2 inches, likely fired by a falconet (a civil war cannon) which would have a barrel length of around 48 inches.. Curious to think that you could own something that could fire it under the regs..

<TEXT> I'd agree that the argument that we need a *new* centre ground party is a bit silly really, the Lib Dems exist and there are many centrist Labour and Conservative MPs that should hold that ground, but it seems that neither the government nor the opposition seem interested in fighting for it in a lot of areas at the moment..

That'll be costly for Labour in upcoming elections, and potentially a bit of a boon to the Lib Dems too, but I do wonder to what degree.  After all, a real real threat from the centre would likeley (hopefully..) result in more centrist government policies and opposition policies (in theory at least, the current leadership of opposition may disagree..). So essentially the current Issues with the Labour party exacerbate the issue, the lack of opposition coupled with the party being associated more and more with positions that are quite a long way from the centre left (as well as the Damage done by elements of Momentum, some of the very pro-Corbyn types and indeed Ken Livingstone ). 

All that said, I don't think that the Lib Dems seem very centrist when it comes to the EU, and there are some severe limits on how far the Lib Dems can push their current position without looking a bit daft, right now I'd argue that they would have a very hard time convincing anyone who voted leave that they were a safe pair of hands to negotiate or carry out an exit from the EU.  Quite the reverse in fact. 

With that in mind, I'm not sure that the Lib Dems are the best party to fight a Tory hard brexit, it's the equivalent of going to the far left against a Tory government, it cedes the centre ground, it doesn't occupy it. The Lib Dems would have to be credible as a party that will take the UK out of the EU on better terms than the Tories (or Labour) to really take that centre, and I don't think they can. They'd alienate far too many of their own members and especially their new supporters if they did (well, unless any exit essentially changed nothing bar the name of our membership, and even then that'd probably cause issues..).

We don't need a new centre ground party to fight a Tory hard brexit, we need centrist MPs of all stripes to hold the government to account and ensure that the terms on which the UK leaves the EU are the best they can be for the UK, taking into account the views of  both remain voters and leave voters.  That would mean accepting the practical realities of the process of leaving and selling the notion of the UK outside of the EU, on the terms that the Lib Dems are happy with.

I'm not sure if that's possible, which is unfortunate, because the alternative could be a bit nasty and will likely take a long time to sort out.. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  To be fair the last referendum was under a completely different setting. Pro Britain = Pro EU. Now is the opposite.

To some degree, but not on the scale that people are suggesting... I mean if you look at Scotland now and the likely routes after independence, there is a good argument to say that Scotland wouldn't join the EU, it'd go the EEA route.  You will note that polling has hardly shifted since the EU vote and doesn't look like it's going anywhere unless something else changes..  So yes, some things have changed, but that doesn't change the fact that there was a referendum, and indeed that people in Scotland don't seem to want another one, and that their voting intention hasn't changed a lot even if there were one soon.

 As Germans we have  mostly because of WW2  a totally different approach towards history and nationality and to me it is contemporary whereas the British feel stuck in time.

You'd have a point if you said that the UK perspective of Europe is different to the German one, and that both are shaped by WWII. The UK doesn't see the EU as a guarantor of peace, it doesn't see it as a necessary progression from the horrors of WWII, both at least in part because it was neither occupied nor the aggressor in that war.  That's not a harking back to Empire though.

As I said since Brexit some people seem too proud and too sure to be on the right side. No questioning at all. Just victorious

People who have been arguing for the UK to leave, campaigned to leave and voted to leave will see it as a victory and no doubt believe that they are on the right side.. But that's in line with what they have been working for and what they think.  That's not really unreasonable.  It is unreasonable to ignore the views of anyone else, but to be honest a lot of the issues there are that the loudest voices have been talking about simply not leaving, or reversing the decision, or indeed running another vote in the hope of achieving either..  

We have to be very careful to find the right balance for the UK and the EU.

We do, and it should be a close relationship, but with the UK firmly on the outside of he political project. That's achievable and I think probably fairly acceptable to most people in the UK. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Something very drastic had changed. 

.. A lot of things have changed, but I don't think they will result in a massive reversal of the current political fortunes of the Liberal Democrats, especially not in the context of the Lib Dems doing better than Labour in a General Election.

 There are a lot of naysayers at the moment but lib dems membership has exploded since the referendum

Labour Membership exploded somewhat more drastically fairly recently, it hasn't been mirrored by their electoral chances though and polling doesn't suggest a huge swing to the Lib Dems either.

 people right now are identifying them as the party against brexit so with the shifting of people's opinions I think the crawl back of the lib dems willbe the major talking point of 2020.

I don't doubt that the Lib Dems won't see some improvement in some areas, but frankly I don;t think Brexit is going to be as important in 2020 as it is now, and I would also argue that the Lib Dem position on it at the moment is going to start getting harmful rather than beneficial, arguing for remain is one thing, blindly doing it when the UK is on its way out is another, arguing to rejoin would be something else altogether. </TEXT>

No government can be so dumb to waste so much money on such a petty thing when the NHS is collapsing.

It's the renewal of a contract, so it's not really new spending by the sounds of it, and whilst the NHS clearly needs a funding boost and a reversal in the current trends of how it is managed, it's not collapsing. Not to mention its not the only thing Governments need so spend money on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While there are a few interesting arguments that the Nazi regime did in fact have some socialist characteristics..

There are good arguments for it, I think when you are an authoritarian regime, there is a some reliance on populism that can often result in some traits you'd also associate with some forms of socialism almost regardless. It sometimes gets pretty twisted though, and at the end of the day, National Socialism is (together with its Spanish and Italian counterparts) almost seen as the definition of (one type..) of Fascism.  Not to mention fairly opposed to the Socialism and indeed communism by the definitions accepted then and now.

Feel free, but it clearly isn't spam, you may want to read the sidebar rules too.. Maybe add a comment when you report it to make your intentions and objections clear, you could perhaps outline what particularly offended you.

If you didn't have an ulterior motive going into this then you would have been more responsive to reason and logic from the other guy in this comment tree.

I discussed it with them,  I'd argue that's responsive enough, I do however disagree with them, which is unfortunate, but it does happen.

I bet it did, I had a fairly decent discussion with my kids about the rise and fall of fascism (eldest is currently covering the causes of WWII in history) and ended up talking about the more recent apparent surge of nationalism and the right wing currently in Europe.  I also get the picture that at least with my kids school, there is a bit of a distorted view being presented that Fascism ended in Europe with the end of WWII, handily excluding Spain in both the pre-war and post-war periods (I think probably because the focus is so heavily on Germany and Italy), it also excludes the impact of fascism in the Balkans...

<TEXT> Whether or not something is a "rant" is in the eye of the beholder. The teacher genuinely thought he was making productive use of class time to teach kids what's happening. Lars Larson is the one that called it a "rant".

True (I can't listen to the damn thing here, as it's early in the morning and I have a daughter asleep who has been having nightmares..). Hence the lack of comment on the actual link you posted..

I don't think it should be a conclusive thing until history has deemed it.

That's true of most things, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about it now.. After all, I don't see the answers to the question in the article, or the ones I posed as looking for a definitive, authoritative answer, but rather a discussion that leads to an opinion.. I mean, that's broadly what a huge number of history (and other humanities) subjects are about, you discuss and think and come to the best conclusion that you can based on whatever factors you consider.

Point being, in my opinion, stuff like this should be a facilitated discussion led by the students, with teacher "opinions" served only to encourage critical thinking (playing devil's advocate, for example), not a class lesson for the day.

Yeah, I wouldn't disagree with that, but I'd see the posing of he question as relatively neutral to the debate, if provocative, in the first instance, after all it can be answered with a yes or a no or anything in between.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's clear you misunderstand how dysfunctional the government is

That's entirely possible.. 

Sure, but courts have limits, and so does general civility. 

Of course.

War is hell, and the entire concept goes above government. I mean, it's a system of "it's ok if innocents die if we maybe hit our target." Obama murdered tons of innocent people holding weddings and funerals. No one "held him responsible" then. I wanted them to, but it's really annoying that Trump is being held responsible for something OBAMA DID when Obama still isn't being held responsible for that stuff.

The really antagonising element there is the lack of a war in any declared sense, we spent a lot of time over the centuries figuring out how we thought rules could be applied and people held to account, and then essentially watched almost everyone simply ignore it by avoiding declared wars and the responsibilities that come with it.. The public reaction is sometimes interesting in that regard too, not sure if you will have seen it, but a Marine in the UK was recently in court because he shot a shot Taliban insurgent under conditions that were not justifiable, the reporting and commentary was.. interesting.

Trump has been pretty normal from what I've seen so far. Our press has been hell-bent on saying things like looking at stairs or talking to people is Hitler 2.0. It's hysteria.

The hitler 2.0 stuff is pretty hysterical, although I'm not sure that this presidency has been entirely normal so far either, although from the election campaign that sort of seems to be he point..

If no one will report on it accurately then it's probably not an important story.

Except it clearly is an important story and the reporting is accurate enough. At the moment the biggest objection seems to be the headline.. Well, apart from the chap up the thread of feels that people suing about being on a kill list are just doing it for personal attention, which seems a little odd.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He has a responsibility to do things he doesn't even know about.

He's the president, he should either know how these systems work, or employ someone who does to be responsible to him on them.. I mean don't get me wrong, I don't expect him to micromanage everything, but I would expect the President to be responsible for what is administration does, especially if that happens to be killing people..

I said I understood that's your expectation. I disagree, but I just wanted it to be clear that's your position. I don't know how responsive he can be before he knows about it, as far as responsibility goes.

You have a point there and a very valid one, although at that point it comes down to where responsibility lies when things go wrong.  To a certain extent isn't that what court cases are suppose determine?

The President is not God. I excused Obama for similar stuff Bush did, but Trump is being lambasted no matter how no hand he had in stuff.

To be fair when it comes to this area, you can't really excuse Obama either. Both Obama and now Trump seem keen to expand on the use of drones and this kind of extraterritorial, legally 'interesting' kill authority, so there isn't quite the same firewall between the administrations and policy.  At least in my view.

The headline should reflect the god damned article. Fuck's sake, that's what I've been saying from the start. If the headline doesn't give a proper summation of what's in the article, it is misleading. This one gives a false implication and encourages people to react to the falsehood without reading the text.

It does reflect the article, but it's a headline, not a summation or a precis of the damn thing.

So nooow you want to distance yourself from the headline. Neat.

....No, again I think the headline is accurate and the article is clear. I don't think the headline is misleading, it could be better, but it is the best one I could find.. Again, it's not like I get to rewrite it..

The press fucking hates Trump, if you've been under a rock for the last year and a half.

I'm in the UK, so the reporting on Trump tends to be either Shrill, or neutral (depending on source..), I've mostly avoided it until more recently because it's horribly divisive with neither side doing themselves any favours. That said, the administration seems hell bent on screwing up things that they could void screwing up, but then I assume there is a domestic audience in the US that that they are appealing to that sees it differently..

Every headline is meant to be "accurate", but create a false implication that creates general smear by the general populous that doesn't read the article. It's total bullshit, and you've helped propagate it. Yay.

The alternative is not posting this story, which frankly seems like more of a loss.  Oh and whilst a lot of people don't read the headline, they are also generally not going to get into any sensible discussion on the subject anyway, so.. fuck em.  

Although to a certain extent I've gotten a little sucked into this whole discussion about headlines now.. So fuck me too I guess..

<TEXT> EU membership is both a carrot and a stick,Hungary gets billions in EU funds while constantly trying to sabotage the EU.

EU membership is EU membership, it means being in the club, having a say in how it works and abiding by the rules. It isn't a tool for some countries to manage how others work..  Hungary does get billions in EU funds (around 5.5bn in fact..) but that doesn't mean it can't press its interests within the EU, funding doesn't buy the EU the country..

Hungary currently has a parasitical relationship to the EU,one party gains(Hungary) while the other is harmed(EU) in the process.

If that were the case, surely the issue was allowing Hungary into the EU then, now that it is in the EU, presumably on the basis that membership would be mutually beneficial, it's a bit rich to call the relationship parasitical. Surely Hungary has every right to put forward it's views and act on them, even if that doesn't match the current consensus elsewhere...

I believe that if you aid and directly further the agenda of a power that seeks to destroy the EU from within you can no longer be considered to have the best interest of the greater union in mind,at some point it makes sense to cut the leash.

And we are back to leashes again...  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So even if he isn't aware, he's the one responsible for all decisions made by the previous admin. Ok, glad that's clear.

Oh come on, that isn't a fair response. He is the president, even if he doesn't know, he has a responsibility. He doesn't have the excuse of saying that it was the previous administration or someone else's job, at best if it's someone else's fuck up he can deflect some of the blame for the situation, but the responsibility still sits with him, and the other mentioned in the suit.

Accurate and clear are different. 

Indeed, and I said accurate, not clear. The article is clear, the headline is accurate, but not comprehensive.

It's a plenty interesting story, but the way it's phrased comes off as if Trump personally put a hit out on these people.

Sort of, it certainly implies that these people have an issue with the President, which isn't untrue either.

It can fucking hint at it though. I don't get how this is such a complex idea here.

I would have preferred 'administration' or similar, but again, it's not my headline, and the alternative sources were on a par or worse..

As an aside, is it just me, or has a lot of the US press simply dropped adding 'President' to the front of the names of Presidents since Obama, and started using the incumbents name rather than office far more often generally? It's a bit jarring at times and it feels more common now.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The trouble is, this is a particularly specialized question. How do you ground these kids in a working concept of political ideology? 

By talking about it and discussing ideologies..

You're talking about a lot of work just to get them to the place they can understand the question being asked. Academically, the nature of fascism is a debatable subject even if you constrain yourself to the obvious European case studies. For example, you can argue that there is not anything that can really be called "fascist economics." Can they recognize the issues with Eco's "ur fascism"? 

Absolutely, defining fascism is hard for academics with specialisms in the field, so I wouldn't expect a teacher, much less their class to do so.  However it does open the door to looking at comparisons and looking for similarities and differences.  Which, to go back to your first point, is a good way of building up an understanding of political ideologies..

Will they just regurgitate whatever HuffPo or Slate article comes up?

That'll depend on what their existing frame of reference is like and yes, the various views that they are exposed to at home and elsewhere. I'd assume it'd play a reasonably big part in how they frame their responses and shape the discussion at least initially.  It'd actually be interesting to listen to a larger group of younger kids do that in the context of history and modern politics..

By all means, discuss Trump, Free Trade, Cultural Marxism, War, Institutional Racism, Civic Culture, etc al. But don't try to fit things into a neat ideological basket that's actually not so neat.

True, but sometimes by asking if something fits in a box, you have a much better environment to do those things in, especially if you are contrasting historical movements with current ones, it means you are looking at something that is relevant now, rather than something that to younger people will seem almost entirely academic.

<TEXT>  While Hungary isn't an enemy of the EU like Russia is,it isn't a friend either 

It's a member for Christ sake.. It is part of the EU, not some external element that can be deemed friendly or hostile.  Granted elements of the current government doesn't seem overly impressed with certain aspects of the EU, but that is kind of their right as a member isn't it?

On the other hand a Hungary outside the EU would probably turn into a russian aligned fascist state capable of undermining the stability of central and eastern europe so it might be better to keep them in the EU.

You make it sound like EU membership is some sort of leash rather than something intended as mutually beneficial arrangement.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yet the shit headline implies that by him being sued that he had some hand in this at all. It's clickbait and you know it.

He is being sued, and he has a hand in it (not the initial listing, but the continued threat), in that he is now responsible for the fuckup by the Obama administration, it goes with the job..

What the hell is with this bullshit "yeah, the headline included 10% of the info you need to make an upvote or downvote judgement, but it's somewhat accurate".

The headline is accurate, it's clickbaity, but given I can't change that and it's a pretty interesting story I don't know what you want.. As to making an 'upvote or downvote judgement' man, that's up to you. I like to read the articles..

You shouldn't need to read the full article to know that the headline is misleading.

You shouldn't expect a headline to give you the detail either though, that's what the articles are for..

I don't even know what all the kill list implies. 

It would seem that it means that if detected and somewhere within reach of the US, they can and will be targeted (in the case of these journalists, have been targeted, and to be clear, whilst Obama was in office..) by drone strikes.

The term suggests that they're up for assassination, but they're not being assassinated, so something's strange here.

If you'd use the term assassination to apply to drone strikes then that'd be accurate enough. And whilst they haven't been successfully assassinated there have been attempts, not that that makes it a lot better. I suppose if either of the last two governments had been successful there wouldn't be a case to answer in court..

Why is "kill-list" always in quotations? Is it really a kill list or is that conjecture? 

It's formally known as the Disposition Matrix, informally as the kill list, hence the quotes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair suing our precious Obama might make him look bad, so it's obviously Trumps fault. Let the record show the Obama administration did no wrong during their 8 years in office

I think the bigger issue would be that suing Obama might not solve the issue.. I assumed it was an 'office holder' thing rather than an individual thing.

As to the notion that this somehow shows that the Obama administration did no wrong during their 8 years in office, I don't quite get that, surely this does exactly the opposite?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It says it's Trump and many in the various departments being sued

Yes.. That would be a group that includes Trump, so the President is being sued, I didn't say or suggest it was only the President being sued.  As you point out, the suit names the President, the Secretary of Defense, the CIA Director, Attorney General and others.

So you either didn't read it or are trying to fuck with people for a political reason.

I read it, I'm pointing out that Trump is being sued so the headline is accurate, but not comprehensive, the article however is fairly comprehensive... At the end of the day it's a headline (and not my headline at that..), you do sort of have to read the rest of it to understand what is going on in full.  

As to fucking with people for political reasons, I'm far more interested in the whole 'being placed on 'kill-list' by mistake' bit, than Obama being responsible for the names being added, or Trump being named as he is currently responsible..

<TEXT> You've proved that a large % of the liberals on r/politics don't read stories just the headlines. 

To be honest, it doesn't seem to be limited to liberals.. As a lefty Brit who isn't pro-EU it gets interesting sometimes..  

And as long as its Anti-Trump it gets upvoted with tons of knee jerk comments.

That is broadly true... Although happily even on /r/politics (hell, almost anywhere on reddit) there is still room for discussion.  There was an interesting piece I posted on teachers asking whether Trump was a fascist that sort of has a similar mix, but at least a few people are still interested in the issues.

So.. It could be worse, but given the sheer number of people on reddit now,  it's probably understandable too. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Creative commons photos being resold as commercial stock.. Any thoughts? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-26 13:12:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I put out a fair amount of photos under creative commons attribution licenses and am starting to run into a bit of an issue with stock image providers offering them individually, without attribution and without the relevant CC license, and charging for the privilege.

To be honest I'm a bit stuck as to what to do, so far when contacting the providers, they offer to remove them, but given they claim that they came from a variety of third parties who in turn claimed that they were their photos, it seems almost impossible to take any action to prevent it reoccurring.

Now my ideal solution would be for them to simply add attribution, if they want to sell them, that's fine with me even if I'm not getting a cut (so far it's all about images I want out there without a cost anyway) but that doesn't seem to be a possibility. That leaves me with a cycle of takedown requests and conversations without real resolution.

Has anyone else come across this and if so, how are you dealing with it? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I ended up having a chat on the train with a random passenger whose laptop bore the same damage as many of mine so I thought I'd share:

I've been using and looking after a small fleet of X2xx's (first 200's and 201s, now 220's and 230's) and one thing that I noticed early was that if you had nothing in the cardslot, inevitably cracks develop. 

Now you can replace the palmrest easily enough, and you can keep doing that as it happens again and again but it seems a bit silly, so way back when I decided to grab the cheapest card available (USB ports, smart card reader etc.. I'd love a blank but they don't seem to exist..) and keep it in the machine.  No more cracks, no more breakage, no more replacing the palmrest.

Anyway, thought it might be useful to someone here, although given it's incredibly obvious I'm sure I'm not the only one... Or maybe my kit just ends up getting more abuse..

<TITLE> I like Jeremy Corbyn's EU, but I don't think it's possible.. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-21 03:52:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The title pretty much says it all, but I'd like to flesh it out a little here.

Watching the various debates and the Sky Q A session from today, I find myself (probably not unsurprisingly..) very much in support of the sentiment that Jeremy is putting forward on the EU, just not the position it is supposed to support. 

The Sky Q A really hit home that I'm essentially taking a leave position on issues that Jeremy also seems to be pretty concerned with, I'd probably scatter some concerns about the fact that if we leave, and do see significant reform (not that I think that terribly likely..), it'll be Tory led reform that goes in the opposite direction that I'd prefer

A socially positive, progressive EU that works for everyone, ensures that governments can act on behalf of their people, that promotes an open and just society and protects the weakest would be great, but it doesn't seem possible. At the same time an EU that decidedly doesn't work is the status-quo and potentially a more hostile and less able and willing to protect workers seems far more likely.

And yes, I recognise that there will likely be a near term economic cost to leaving the EU, and no, I'm not terribly happy with the idea of a future government pushing hard to utterly dismantle free movement either, but the risk the EU poses, and the benefits of being able to act outside the EU without being linked to the project in its current form (and potentially after another round of integration..) seem to balance that out. 

What I'd have liked to have seen was something a little more compelling and substantive about how we might get the changes we want, and what sort of time frame we'd be talking about. I'd also have liked to have heard more about how we could mitigate the issues we do face, and indeed why there is value in remaining in an EU with an often regressive and sometimes dysfunctional regulatory system.

We go to vote on Thursday, and result aside, I think everyone involved has done a pretty crappy job of both pushing the debate and making their respective cases, even on the doorstep the arguments have been less than stellar, and that's one area where you do have time to have a bit of a conversation.

Anyway, I'd just like to add that I like the idea of Jeremy's EU, I don't think we can build it out of what we have at the moment, so maybe if we leave we should talk about how we go about building something like that in the UK, and then beyond.. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I managed to [smash the screen on my swift](http://i.imgur.com/zW8yfOh.jpg). The damage was the result of a drop from desk height onto a wooden floor, and landing dead flat and screen down.. It happened whilst I was setting myself up to take a photo of the VR goggles that I found worked well, and is the result of me not paying attention, so that's nice.

Anyway, first things first, the wileyfox case obviously doesn't protect the screen in any way (it doesn't extend past the  front of the phone) although I think it does make the phone easier to hold (and looks good..) I do wonder if without the case it might have fallen more randomly and not landed flat, but hey, not the cases fault.

However, I suppose it does give me the opportunity to test out the screen repair service and to outline how the process runs.  Now, I've never broken a phone screen before (And don't intend to again for that matter..) so I have nothing to compare it against like for like, however so far I've been pretty impressed with the people at Wileyfox.

I called their support number and the first person I spoke to was able to deal with everything end to end (which is always nice..). I had screen protection anyway, so it was a simple matter of confirming some details having the return process outlined (pack, include email and post..) and waiting for an email. As it happened the email came whilst I was still talking to the customer service person.. All in, it was painless, efficient and quick.  

I did ask about turnaround time and was told that they wouldn't give a firm commitment, but that they process repairs as quickly as possible. Frankly I was reasonably happy with that over being promised something that doesn't quite happen, but a worst case/maximum period would have been nice to know.

In any case, I just posted the phone (so it went out today) and it will arrive with their service centre tomorrow morning. So, it'll be interesting to see if it remains plain sailing from here or if there are issues, as well as how long it does take.

In the meantime, I'm back on my LG which means less battery time and quite a lot less performance... Although without a scratch or crack in the screen over the last few years, so i'll do for now.

I'll update this as stuff happens, if stuff happens! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Battery life after the Swift cyanogenOS 13 update </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-15 20:16:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I saw that a few people had issues with the update, and quite a few others didn't see much difference afterwards, so I thought I'd throw in a quick (and positive) observation on battery life.

I only switched to the Swift a while ago and was pleased at the battery life compared to my older LG (which had a relatively new after-market battery in..), essentially I went from having to charge my phone briefly during the day to it lasting from when I got up, to when I went to bed.  So that was a nice, although frankly an expected plus.  So all of last week with my nice shiny new phone, I'd have my phone charged to 100% as I got up and it'd be down to about 20%/30% when I was done for the day.

However since the update, the amount of power being used by the phone when it's asleep seems to have fallen quite dramatically (based on the power usage graphs anyway). It's a bit after 7pm here now after a day of admittedly light usage, but no additional charging, and the battery is still reporting 85% full [You can see the graph here..](http://imgur.com/HbHiLU2). 

Given I get notifications via KDEconnect on my laptop the phone does appear to have been doing it's thing with emails and so, it's been hooked to my company VOIP all day too, and I've had it in my hand more often than I would have my old LG (mostly because it has been dying slowly..) but it's looking like the 'standby' periods have been quite a lot less draining than previously.

Now, obviously it's a correlation, and I'll see what it looks like over the week, but even a moderate improvement in battery usage when the phone isn't directly being used would be a huge boost..

Anyway, keeps me happy, has anyone else noticed anything interesting?  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-05-12 12:13:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just replaced my (no longer quite so) trusty LG P880 with a swift. The LG was running Cyanogen Mod and I was pretty happy with the 'Eleven' music player. 

However, given I have a nice new phone that's running what appears to be a solid OS, and a promise I've made not to mess with it (so that I have it in a working condition all the time...) mean I've hit a mild issue in that the apk I have for Eleven, whilst working, results in semi regular crashes during playback and general unhappiness.

So I wondered what people were using that plays nicely with audioFX, is reasonably simple and works.. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-05-20 12:44:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Thank you for all your questions and I hope we managed answer most of them - Maria, George and Jack will drop back in and answer some of the remaining ones as and when (and you know how to get hold of them directly if you want to), they are off to deal with the last two days of campaigning now!

I'd just like to say it's been fun, really busy, some great questions and please remember, that if you are in the EU go and vote for someone you believe in on polling day!

------


Hi Everyone,


The three of us [Maria](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/maria-aretoulaki) (/u/PiratePartyUKMaria), [George](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/george-walkden) (/u/drgwalkden)  and [Jack](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/jack-allnutt) (/u/m2ys4u) are standing in the North West of England for the European Parliamentary Elections.


So, ask us anything!

(And then go and vote for us on the 22nd. Obviously).


----

OK, so our candidates have been going at this for about 5 hours now, thanks for all the questions so far, I'm just adding a note to say that Maria has to go to a pane event on immigration to make the parties case and will get back to your questions later (and probably tomorrow). Jack and George should be around for a while longer. 

I'll also try to make sure any questions not aimed at a candidate get an answer from me, or someone else from the party too!

(Deja-vu? Yes, this was initially posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/260mob/we_are_the_three_uk_candidates_for_the_pirate/) but we ran into some problems with the account it was posted from that we can't easily resolve so it's been removed and recreated here! - Do go and look at what has already been answered, but if we can keep the discussion here that would be great! - /u/subject3078 (I do campaigns stuff for the Pirate Party..)

*Edits: *

To answer a few questions up front :

Our policies are available [on our policy pages](www.pirateparty.org.uk/policy)

Our EU election [pages give an overview of us in this election](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/campaigns/european-elections-2014)

You can support our EU [election campaign via our crowdfunding effort]
http://www.pozible.com/project/180266) 

Last but not least, a lot of our [campaigns material, including posters featuring all of the three candidates are available too](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/campaigns/activists/materials) - Feel free to take, adapt, reuse and share (or, if you support us,  print and display..!)

Oh, and somewhat remiss not to include this, but - [You can Join the party and get involved (which includes standing in elections...) here](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/join). </TEXT>

<TITLE> UK Pirate Party makes the switch to Drupal </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-28 16:36:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I thought this might be appropriate here - The UK Pirate Party switched to Drupal and relaunched its website today (soft launch a week ago, pre-release for about 2 weeks and its been in development since around a year ago - lots of things got in the way!).

I lead that effort and thought I'd share a few things.

Firstly, what we needed.  It probably won't surprise anyone here, but the requirements for something that can be volunteer built, run and managed but also be the core of a political parties IT infrastructure are pretty complex.  

We needed something that first and foremost was a CMS, its all about the content! but it also had to be capable of a few other things too, not least managing our membership, handling mails outs for subscribers members and press, running internal elections, taking payments and donations (and reporting them sensibly), promoting events, and a whole host of other things.  Drupal was selected after looking at all of the available open source CMS's out there.

We also made a decision that for the build we wanted to do as little coding as possible - not because we didn't have the skills in house, or volunteers who desperately wanted to write code, but because we wanted something maintainable and easy to get people to transition on to.  So, apart from the theme and a few tens of patches to other modules (only included if they were accepted..) that's what we did.  No custom code (except a single one off script to migrate users...), no new in house modules.  Of course we use views heavily and there is a bit of using modules as glue, but you could replicate the whole site tomorrow with a list of modules and the theme.

The end result was quite a lot of work, finding a way of running concurrent development and future 'live' systems, trying to get a group of volunteer developers to complete specific tasks on a platform that doesn't lend itself that well to version control and generally working to find combinations of modules and work around to do what we needed.  I'd argue its usually harder to keep things simple than anything else, but that was the aim.

Given [pirateparty.org.uk](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk) is a fairly high traffic site, we also had to look at performance, with our IT lead putting in a lot of time working out how best to deploy drupal on Debian, with nginx in a redundant manner..  But hey, there is lots of documentation and a good community so its more than doable.

Now, the end result isn't earth shattering (and we are now working on phase 2 requirements) but it looks like its going to work very well for us and change the way we have been working for a long time.  It means we can get volunteers in more easily to help us manage and maintain the site and, its going to reduce the amount of time we expend on web related stuff by an order of magnitude.  On our old Django site, a press release took easily 20 minutes to format and publish, blogs and articles took a lot of time to complete, contacting members, donors and others was not-trivial and making even minor adjustments was a pain.  Now it takes us 2 minutes to publish something we have prepared, mail sending can be largely automated, membership management and review is easy.

All in all thanks to Drupal (and Debian, Nginx etc..) we are going to be able to do more of the stuff that we are here to do - campaign and make a difference politically in the UK.  Oh, and after 1 a year of this I can absolutely say that I love   hate Drupal with a passion..

<TEXT> And the missing poster with more details is here - https://twitter.com/Syncosia/status/414367260086927360/photo/1.  However Millie went missing a couple of days ago after (IIRC) another dog had a go at her.  She might still have her lead attached and may have been injured. 

(For clarity, she's not my dog - this is sort of an extension of the twitter word of mouth that's been going on - I live way down the hill and took my kids out for a look and I've been talking to dog walkers but the more people out and aware the better). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure if I can arrange it, but if I can is there any interest? /r/ukpolitics may be a better bet, but I figured for Sheffield MP's there may be some interest (we have a large enough community now after all!).  I think Paul Blomfield might be up for it, he's been running public meetings for a while, but I can try all of them...

Any thoughts?

The current crop of MP's for Sheffield are:

* Rt Hon Mr David Blunkett (Brightside and Hillsborough)
* Mr Paul Blomfield (Central)
* Rt Hon Mr Nick Clegg (Hallam)
* Ms Meg Munn (Heeley)
* Mr Clive Betts (Sheffield South East)
* Angela Smith (Penistone and Stocksbridge) </TEXT>

However, it's getting a little long in the tooth and I've been looking to see what might work as a sensible upgrade path - however, it seems that there isn't a huge amount of performance to be gained from newer models, there doesn't appear to be anything with a 4:3 screen nor anything without a touchpad on the palm rest...  Not to mention that the X230 I managed to borrow feels a lot more fragile (and less compact somehow..). Am I missing something, or does anyone have any recommendations?  Durability is a huge factor for me so if the newer models are less robust it would probably make more sense to stick with the X61s..

*edit: I should say, I'm in the UK...*

<TEXT> Question popped into my moderator inbox today from one of my fellow mods and, at first glance it seemed like a daft questions.  However, the more I think about it the more interesting it gets...  Obviously moderators have a particular set of things they have to do as moderators, but given that reddit is at least partly about imaginary internet points, it seems they might be a useful tool in moderation.

I wonder what the impact it would have on moderator behaviour having scores (on a per subreddit basis I think) for mod links and comments would have - or to take it a little further, to have stats on the number of posts or comments removed, users banned, replies to users etc...

Any thoughts?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Since we are talking about School.. I seem to have solved the homework problem. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-12 19:45:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'd just like to say that as my kids have gotten older, its become somewhat harder to make sure everyone does their homework sensibly and on time - I did have a day for each of them to sit down away from the general mayhem of the rest of the house at my desk to do their work - but that seems to have fallen somewhat apart (essentially trying to do too many things at ones.

As of last week we instituted school work hour for all 4 of them, at the kitchen table.  Mondays is music practice (brass instruments... I'm sorry neighbours..) so we do that in the sitting room, but the rest of the week is whatever the homework is, usually a mixture of reading and written work at the table, all together.

As of today, all the issues ironed out, I can only say I'm incredibly proud of my eldest two - I work from home too and about 20 minutes in I realised I was sat at a table with my eldest two, everyone working quietly, only pausing to query spellings between each other.. http://i.imgur.com/R3uQF7p.jpg  (I had to take a picture).

They get to choose the music for the period too, so yesterday was the Beatles, today is bond themes (by brass bands) and the Eagles..

It can't last, but hey, its nice right now. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi folks, I moderate /r/sheffield (amongst a few others) and over the last week we seem to be seeing a moderate number, for us at least, of spam posts that are all coming from users with a vaguely phonetic username that reads like an initial and surname with a group of numbers at the end (something like AMorse0000 or HTucked0000).  There are even repeats of the 'name' bit with different numbers on the end.

The posts themselves are incredibly obvious spam ('Awwww a dead hamster' as a subject that links to a US coupon site kind of thing) and most are picked up and dumped immediately into the spam queue, and some of the 'users' are being banned, but in a sub with just under 1,000 subscribers it seems odd to be seeing it at all. Essentially I can't see why anyone would see the value in posting there automatically or otherwise, there isn't the traffic.

So, if I am seeing it, is this common for larger subs? Is it a new thing (or have we simply become interesting enough in someone's perspective)?

Anyway, cheers. </TEXT>
