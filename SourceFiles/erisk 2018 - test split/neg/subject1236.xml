<TEXT> Hello, me and my friend where talking about where we first heard wars low rider and he said the movie robots. We skipped through it but couldnt find it, maybe you folks could help us out



To make it 200 words:
In a world of sentient robots, striving young inventor Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) wants to work for the avuncular Bigweld (Mel Brooks), whose Bigweld Industries makes spare robot parts. But Bigweld has just been deposed as company head by the villainous Phineas T. Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), who wants to make all robots submit to profitable forced upgrades. In this animated adventure, Rodney and his friend Fender (Robin Williams) go underground to fight Ratchet's evil plans. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [QUESTION] Help regarding recording a guitar track, specifically how can I sort of eliminate it from the song (so I don't have to use bad backing tracks w/o vocals) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-04 21:20:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello folks!
My guitar teacher let me borrow his processor, a Avid Eleven Rack if curious and I'm loving it and thinking about doing a cover. I don't need help with recording, mixing or stuff like that, rather than the song I want to cover.
How can I cover a song without downloading a crappy backing track without lyrics? I would love the lyrics to be there, I was thinking that fuck it, just gonna record over the song, it feels wierd however. The song I'm talking about is Gojira - From The Sky. Is there any way to sort of eliminate the guitar track completely from the original song or sort of volume it down in order to let me guitar be the dominant one.
Probably a stupid question, I hope to recieve an answer however. </TEXT>

<TEXT> hi fellas,  
i would love to learn a progressive metal song which is played on a 6 string guitar. I've found some great songs I would love to, unfortunately most of them are on 7 or 8 strings.  
Would be great that the song you recommend stays under 4 minutes.

thanks fellas

EDIT: would be awesome if your recommendations were something in the lines of Animals as leaders or scale the summit etc. </TEXT>

It's a video game that exists in a fucking virtual platform.   
I agree there's a limit, I would give several weeks of banhammer to 2 int's too, but fucking perma? I'm sure that you have inted in your playing time, whether it was 4 years ago or 5 or who knows when. </TEXT>

I got a Oneplus 2 for 4 months now and I needed to get some pics and videos to my pc. Well, when I connectit to my pc, 80% of the pics and videos are not in DCIM folder, nor anywhere else. In order to get them I had to import all the images and videos.

Here's a video of the problem. Battery in, input output cables into the amp and no sound what so ever. I can feel the pedal being warm when i touch it with my hands so it is getting power. It has worked before, not today though. When I push it hard, the amp makes some noise, similar to taking your cable out of your guitar when amp's on.

<TEXT> Ran into a little problem 5 minutes ago.
I have a Schecter Lady Luck, 2 humbucker pickups. Basically, If I have selected both and both pickup volmes are full, it makes sound. When I turn the bridge one down, there is absolutely no sound even though the upper one is still on max volume.
When I select the upper one only, it makes a sound though, and if both are selected and volume is up, by "punching" the upper pickup with my pick it makes a sound. Wierd shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, I'd figure I would come here and I ask if you could recommend/tell me any movies where the criminals - let them be bank robbers, just robbers, drug lords, hitmen etc.

Here's a passage I took from a review of Heat since simple under 300 character questions are forbid it seems:  

Michael Mann's writing and direction elevate this material.

It's not just an action picture. Above all, the dialogue is complex enough to allow the characters to say what they're thinking: They are eloquent, insightful, fanciful, poetic when necessary. They're not trapped with cliches. Of the many imprisonments possible in our world, one of the worst must be to be inarticulate - to be unable to tell another person what you really feel. These characters can do that. Not that it saves them.

My friend made money from selling shit in growtopia. He didn't even play it, he just found some kind of a site that double's your world locks if you gave these to them for a week and they are worth good money so he made some business. I remember I was with him when he was about to sell something, literally 11 year olds handed him 150 for fucking growtopia locks.  
  
  
Well once there was a kid who scammed him, because they made the trade online. But since it was on facebook. we had the kids name and all, my friend searched through the kid's facebook friend list and founder her mother. Gave her a call, mother apologized and payed the money.  

Just in case you wonder, my friend told me that selling the world locks for IRL money isn't even allowed, and they ban accounts where you can see stacked up world locks waiting to be sold. He had an account ban literally worth of 3000. Dude is 15 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thought i'd share you this gif of when it is exactly occurring when the adapter literally turns itself off. Whenever I plug something in the input audio jack in the pedal or in the amp (if the other end is in the output jack in the pedal ofcourse :D) the light turns off and power is lost. If I just have the power block connected to the amp and pedal everything's fine, adapter light is on. If i put the cable to pedal output, it still is green. If I plug the output cable to amp input, it turns off. When let's say I have put the output in the pedal, not in the amp input yet, but i put another audio cable to the input, without even the other end being connected to my guitar, it turns off. Horrible explanation, I can't explain it better, ain't a native speaker. 

TLDR; Input = no power

<TEXT> Continent is such a horrible term tbh. How large is that "large" piece of landmass to get recognized as a independent continent etc. Some argue that a continent is a landmass that is resting on one tetonic plate, but that is arguable, since there are some 10+ tetonic plates, some are just holding the sea with few islands, and we don't define it as a fucking continent. India is on a seperate plate than Eurasia's plate, we don't say that India is a continent, since it is also connected to the landmass of the giant Eurasia content. There is the carribean plate with islands, we don't define those as continents either.   
TL;DR: The term continent is fucking horrible and confusing </TEXT>

<TEXT> A continent is a large piece of landmass from others. Europe and Asia "areas" are on the giant Eurasia continent, divided into two "areas": Europe and Asia.  
I'm just a random 15 year old 4(B or C something i guess?) grade student from Estonia, some people may argue with me, but that's what I learned, i'm quite sure geographists agree with me, and it all makes sense to me myself. If you take an image of the [image of the Eurasia continent](https://thestateofthecentury.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/eurasia-map1.jpg), you can clearly see that Europe and Asia are on this one giant landmass.

<TEXT> I still read it even though I dont know a single narcissist, but the thing I have noticed is that some of posters think that being punished even once = max level narcissism. I dont know, but you  cant really raise a kid by letting him do everything he she wants, never punishing and telling what might be wrong. Some just cry there for 1 incident in their younger years and are going no contact now, years later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well first time I drunk alcohol was at like 4 when I asked to try beer from my uncle, disliked it. But I suppose you are looking for the first drunk experience. At a friends birthday, freshly turned 15 myself aswell, 1L rum and I had 2g of weed. Drank 4 glasses of 50/50 rum and cola mix, then went to smoke weed in the woods. Worst. Fucking. Idea. Ever. Such a fucking headrush and instant horrible feeling, I leaned onto my friend and somehow got inside, there I went and lied on a couch, swimmed on the floor and did the most random things ever. No big hangover though, so lucky me. </TEXT>

I thought about buying the cool lighters I see in shops, but then I thought how and can I even bring them on the plane back? Let's say about 5 lighters I would like to buy atleast. I read that I gotta put them in hand luggage not the checked luggage  

I know that I can buy them after the security check if there are some souvenir shops etc, when I went to barcelona I just bought 3 after the security check and later just walked onto the plane with them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My younger sisters (11) friend (12) isnt allowed to come and play with my sister at our place, it's about a 4 minute walk from her house. The friend's mother believes there are pedophliles and rapists. It is an area of private houses. I have driven this area through with a bike for hundreds of times and I have yet to see some wierd fuckers here. Only ones who are outside are kids and teens. It's a region for people who earn a bit more than the average salary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all I'm 15, maybe that's why I don't understand all the clusterfuck in the movie. I have one thing I would need some clarification on.

Were The Narrator and Tyler Durden 2 different people who just were each other copies basically?  
Or was it actually 1 person (narrator and durden), but it was depicted as 2 in the movie?  
Please answer in full sentence with straight answer  
The more I think about it, the more i don't understand.

<TEXT> Me and my friends wanted to go to waterpark in Prnu which is 100km away from my hometown. Told my mom I was going to a friends house as the lie. So we got there, everything was fun and good until I went for the last jump from the tower, 3m from the pool. One dude was before me, he jumped and i waited for him to swim towards the ladder and i jumped. But for some reason he swam back to the landing point and I fell almost on top of him. My right hand hit his shoulders. Huge pain was felt. Went to emergency, 2 finger bones broken and my hand was put in a cast. Went home with it, mom was angry as fuck that I lied, cant go out anymore. Im 14. </TEXT>

Here I am right now, 14 and loving the other Reggae aswell. I am still a big fan of Marley, but I dislike his ,,wannabe-fans'' 'cause they think that every Reggae piece is by Bob Marley. Some examples: Sweat (Inner Circle), Red Red Wine (UB40), Legalize It (Peter Tosh). They don't even have Bob's voice, yet people think ye it's reggae, so it must be done by Bob Marley, cause he is the most famous one, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> True that. The newest reggae song I like is Jesse Royal - Finally although it is about smoking weed, but I like the vibe. The others I listen are all before 1990's.

<TITLE> TIFU by not knowing that yellow raspberries exist my whole life </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-01 15:51:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So let's start off by saying that I love raspberries. They are my favorite berry by far. At home my mom grows like 3 bushes of them, aunt grows like 30, grandma grows like 30 aswell and uncle grows like 500 (uncle sells them for living along with other things he gets from his garden).  
Well, I am at my aunt's place right now and she needed some help outside for carrying 2 poles to another location, got my gloves and went to help her. We get the pole and walk to the destination and there are tons of raspberries at the buses we walked by. I said that ,,holy shit, so many perfectly red raspberries", she said that that is true. We get the pole on the ground and go back for another one. Suddenly she says that look how many yellow ones are ready aswell. I was like wtf there are yellow raspberries growing? She said ye ofcourse, feel free to take them, they are as sweet as the normal red ones. I was mindblowed. YELLOW RASPBERRIES?!?!?! I ate them and they were delicious. Sad thing that I realised after that they have been growing there for 14 years and I thought that they are raw since raw raspberries are kinda greenish yellowish.  
TL;DR: didnt know yellow raspberries exist for 14 years, turned out they do and they are delicious </TEXT>

After that I went to the kitchen to get some food and I come back to the room and it's empty. Thought that maybe he went to take a shit and went to drop down to my bed when suddenly a hand grabs my foot. He was  under my fucking bed trying to scare me and I hit my head so hard against a corner that I had to get 2 stitches on the head. 2 fucking AM. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love it! It is a relaxing piece of music that from time to time has a message in it aswell ;)  
I was like 11 when I first started to love Reggae and now  I absolutely love it, prefer it to every other genre of music.  Mm.. it's instead of albums I would just give you some reggae songs that I started to love reggae through. Gotta be honest, nowadays, reggae isn't that good that it was in the Bob Marley, Inner Circle and UB40. Yet, there are some artists that do some good stuff, but for a disliker of reggae I would recommend:  
[Bob Marley - Stir It Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3UqvWk8-uw)  
[Bob Marley - Three Little Birds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LanCLS_hIo4)  
[UB40 - Rde Red Wine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXt56MB-3vc)  
[Bob Marley - Kaya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JUm_Y0R6Og)  
These were the first few reggae songs I heared and from there on I listened more and I started to like it. Lots of B.Marley, cause to be honest, he is the best reggae artist of all time. I'm actually quite lucky though, that in Estonia, this nation that consists of 1.3 people, have an awesome reggae band called Bombillaz. You can check them out if you want to, but you won't understand anything unless you are an estonian, what makes it ever harder to understand them is that they use lots of estonian slang and speak quite fast.  
But yeah, I hope that my little-little comment here helps you a bit surviving to listening to reggae ;)  
EDIT: Feel free to listen to Bob Marley's children music. Ziggy has some great vibes aswell!  </TEXT>

Man/Girl, I would've litereally, escaped home to a friend or somebody. I have done it myself. My parents were cunts too, wasnt allowed to go outside except school and I couldnt meet friends that way. One night I made a deal with a friend who knew my problems and his parents aswell and they waited around the streets corner, I went out of the window at night with my stuff and went to his place. I was there for 3-4 days and then my parents got my friends number somehow and asked me some stuff etc. and I had a little talk and they cancelled their rules.  </TEXT>

Like litereally, make him buy a 2nd SIM and change it when he is home and use some crappy 30 buck phone where his actual messages are. If their parents still want to read them messages and phone things, maybe the dude can live in your house a bit so his parents maybe would understand that they are abusing the law actually. A child, BUT HE IS A FUCKING ADULT, has a right for privacy. Man if my parents would watch my phone, hell yeah I would throw it broken in front of them or tell them to eat ass or something. It is rude but they are ruining a grown up's life. How can he allow this, I have no idea </TEXT>

<TITLE> Redditi arvamused Graffitist leldse, ning selle liigist: tnavakunstist </TITLE>

<TEXT> Enda poolt eldes: Head graffitit ning tnavakunsti ma naudin. Sites 4 aastat sama bussiliiniga, vaatan ma alati mberringi kas nen mnda uut teost ning hindan mttes. Muidugi, lihtsalt lamp he jutiga sodimine on jubedus, kuid ilusasti tehtud piece, http://imgur.com/r/Graffiti/0UBDEB9, kus on mngitud vrvide ja kurvidega on minujaoks meistriteos. Piece thendab vhemalt 3 vrvilist teost, kuhu on artisti TAG kirjutatud ,,ilusasti''. Tnavakunst, ehk siis abloonidega tehtud meeldivad mulle veel rohkem. Eriti just Edward von Lnguse teosed (http://evl-genius.blogspot.com/) on vgagi meisterlikkud ning millimeetri tspsega vljaligatud abloonid ning tnaval on need nagu muuseumi eest. Kahjuks pesti Tallinas vanalinnas tema uusim teos maha. https://scontent-bru.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/11081425_810662002344600_4882830377801495164_n.jpg?oh=7e317099aa9d8dbe4f5eccbf5a883aed oe=55A5BE13 - Alasti keiser.   Vljatoodud blogis on 99% tema teostest.   
Tartus vetavat tnavakunstii hsti vastu, eriti Lnguse oma kus ta kige rohkem tegutseb, kuid Tallinnas on tal juba 2 td maha vetud. Kuulsaim teos on tal kas Kannalhabe ja niaktt vi Sure, koer mis on siin ka ks top post.  
Teie arvamusi tahan kuulda siin just selleprast, et Lnguse tga niimodi lks. Kasiti maha. Sadakond turisti oli tolle juures end pildistada lasnud isegi  
Suvalised mu**id seintel muidugi tuleks maha kasida raudselt :)

* When did you start playing League?  
* How did you get to League?  
* Did you play any other physical sports before you quit and started playing LoL?  
* If you answered **yes** to the question** before**. Then why did you quit?  
* How did you pro teams start to notice you?  
* How did they approach you to ask and join their team?  
* What does your family think of you playing videogames to earn and make a living out of it?  
* What do you think of older generation people who think that videogames are for children or a childish activity?  
* What do you think of TSM as an organisation itself and the team?

<TEXT> To start things off, I'm a lover of disrespect, fun and cool mechanical champs. I am a Nasus lover and also Singed lover. With Nasus I usually stomp lane no matter what, even when I get babysitted a ton or im against a counterpick that silvers believe is teemo. I have 400 stacks at 20 like 90% of times which I consider great. I usually farm up to 700-800 stacks and then start serious grouping. 
With Singed however, I can be 1/10 or something similar but I still manage to win most of the times because I proxy. Today, I litereally gave my team 3 dragons straight cause I was laughing and proxy farming in their base and my team also pushed bot and got inhib free there while I was having fun with 2 enemies at top which at the end of the day didnt kill me. What do you think would be the better way for me to rank up? </TEXT>

Basically police arresting a marijuana bearded man. The marijuana bearded man is actually a well know fiction charachter who had moss growing as a beard. It has a political message behind it cause in Estonia, you actually get more prison time by owning marijuana than lets say punching your wife to injuries (not always tho, if the injuries are very hard that the wife is now on wheelchair forever)

Famous Pulp Fiction scene with faces replaced with very well known film characters Joosep Toots and Arno Tali from film Kevade (1969) There isn't a Estonain who doesn't know what Kevade is. Either way he knows the original book from 19th century or the film made in the 20th century.


He has sold some of his stencils and work for over 600 (for collectors, not other artists, ofcourse)

I doubt its a mouse or keyboard problem cause they both stop working at the same time, it ain't windows fault too cause i just reinstalled windows.

<TEXT> I've been having this problem in past month or so that both of my mouse and keyboard suddenly stop working and i hear the plug out voice in windowows. I doubt its a mouse or keyboard problem cause they both stop working at the same time, it ain't windows fault too cause i just reinstalled windows. I think its either dust problem or USB ports are simply broken and i have to buy a new motherboard which means 100 gone. All drivers are the newest. Keyboard is Logitech K200 and mouse is SteelSeries Kinzu (v1) </TEXT>

<TITLE> DVI adapter question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-30 20:12:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi! So I recently bought a DVi-VGA adapter so i could connect my 2nd monitor. Comes out that my DVI adapter in the DVI hole has 4 extra parts: http://imgur.com/EaLjeLQ  
This is what my DVI connectors look in my PC: http://imgur.com/8ZhYHq6  
I wonder if the adapter will work when i punch these 4 extra parts in or basically break them or it wont. Dumb as hell question problably you thinking right now, but im just a dumbass and dont know if they are needed. By the way, Yes I know that PC is dusty as hell, going to the store tomorrow to buy some air in bottle-shaped thing :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im looking to main GP in Season 5 since it melts squishies, and i hate Adc so i just remove then from fight. In teamfights you first gotta get a good ult off, and ofcourse before teamfights poke the bitches. In teamfights, raise ur teams morale by using your so you give them some more AD and also a bit of mobility. In teamfights, if you get CC'd and you know it has a long CD eat oranges, so they basically wasted a CC, and you can do ur stuff on. Other than that, try to Q Q Q Q Q in teamfights. For build i recomment: Shiv-Triforce-IE-Hydra-Tank Item (depends on the situation). Also get Mercs somewhere there for ultimate CC reduction. Start building triforce by sheen, shiv by avarice and get like 500 extra gold from Q and Avarice together. Sheen gives you more slapping power. Critplank is the best version of gangplank. You will have 300+ AD with my pirate stuff and crit like 1200 so its quite amazing - Have fun and AHOOOOYYY </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gonna do this quickly. Will your hair grow as a dreadlock after you have made dreadlocks? Explanation: You made Dreadlocks to 20cm hair. Now they are 40cm. So do you have 40cm dreadlocks or is it like 20cm at bottom are dreadlocks at 20cm hair at top is just hair. I know, the question and my problem is dumb as hell but I just dont have any idea and I kill myself by overthinking. Thank you! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello folks!
I recently picked up Vladimir and I kinda like  him and I thought I would give this champion a go for main. I won a lane against a Gragas, shit on Xin Zhao with  him being lvl 2 at 8 minutes and carried the game single-handedly by destorying their carries with Q E and 2 autos and they were dead. I would love to know what kind of runes are good on him, and general tips about him. Also my build path looks something like this: Start - Ruby Crystal 2xHPots. Core: Hauting Guise - Sorc Shoes - Will of the Ancients - Zhonya - Deathcap - VoidStaff or Upgrade Guise to Liandry. Sums I have always gone Flash/Ignite. In lane at 20 minutes I end up with like 140-150 CS which in my opinion is fine since Vladimir's basic attacks are piece of shit but I somehow manage to last hit with them a lot. Maxing Q E R W

<TEXT> AT the beginning a woman drives a car and talks with her telephone but suddenly she makes a car crash with a person, who is a cannibal. She goes to see what she has done but ends up getting beaten and killed by cannibals friends. She was driving to a surviving in the wild without tools TV show. On the place itself, on the plains in the center of the forest near the road they all get to know the rules and leave to the forest and the cameraman goes to his bad-ass streaming studio on the wheels, a RV made to it. Already on the first hours they see wierd fast stuff which are cannibals and see their friends die. They end up in an old paper factory which is the cannibals base and there are tons of cars there who belong to cannibals victims. In the factory, some gang-bang happens and 3 of them survive. The show creator, and a pair who was made at the beginning - man and a woman. </TEXT>

AS for faster clear, obvious and 1 crit chance because of personal preference.
Movement speed for moving faster between lanes and in the jungle
Now yellows: All flat HP since I buy armor always more than magic resist, and +72health makes it easier to survive the first clears.
Scaling Magic Resist since I prefer to buy more armor which means I will have less magic resist than armor by quite amount. Most of the MR is straight for late, but early MR isnt bad aswell.  

Ofcourse depends on what enemy team is off but I consider it to a team atleast with 1 AP champion.  
  
Hopefully you understood everything, I know that my sentence ,,build'' is kinda bad but English isn't my native language.  
  
EDIT: My regular build would be TrailBlzWarrior TriForce Tabi/Mercs/Swiftness Randuins Warmogs and Spirit Visage OR the same build with an expection to replace TriForce with Frozen Hearterino/Sunfire Caperino if im the only tank. (the choice between frozen heart and sf cape depends if enemies have more AS dependent champion other than adc) </TEXT>

If you Mercs zell them get tabis and then get zephyr or reversed.  You can tank all inhib turrets but I havent yet found a way how to tank nexus turrets alone. Lasers do damage.

<TEXT> Nasus isnt that easy, must know how to pressure and last hit and stack effectively. 
Fizz early game is very hard, lasthitting with him is hard since when  you go and lasthit a creep you will get a lot of poke. gotta know how to roam good.
Jungler: Udyr: need to know stance thingies, calculations and pressuring.

<TEXT> Way too much stuff for ADC. Basically 2 passives: Black Spear that seems more of a support thing to me and then the dash thing. Also she has some kind of a ghost. I dont understand. What is wrong with just a passive like jinx or lucian has. Obviously Kalista is retarded and ridiculously overpowered. I just dont see the reason we need to put so much stuff to a one guy. Her E is the same as sejuanis but just 100000000000000x better </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! Im a Silver 1-2 player who has not yet found a champion that he can play 24/7. I have tried many. I get tired of them after 10 games. But I do not get tired of Katarina and Vlad. I like playing champions that are kinda rare like Vlad. My question is that has Vlad the pontentional to solo-carry a game kind-of? Like do most of the damage so your team can finish off etc? In my opinion like 60% and 70% ap ratios are quite okay, 45 for a AoE E would not be bad too, I have a nice ultimate that deals a nice portion of damage. In lane I could sustain and pool the gankerinos (hehe). So shall I give him a try? He seems so badass </TEXT>

where players flame eachother. There is you, the friendly guy who gets annoyed if others are flaming and tell them to shut up. Riot, the almighty god has made a nice feature, that when you press tab................................there is magical chat-shaped button in the flaming fellas horisontal line called ,,MUTE''.

TL;DR use the mute function its free and works flawlessly. No need to start flaming yourself to get one guy to shut the fuck up </TEXT>

<TITLE> Anyone with me? The new colors of new champions and icons </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-07 22:40:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> They are so blue, neonish and modern. Like in my opinion Kalista is a bitch with led lamps and they are all different kinds of blue. Maokai is a tree. Trees are green and brownish, sometimes white and if really old and wet its grey. Well the new maokai he is colored like shit, new ability icons are again some blue-grey shit. This is a change that i would never like them to implement. Like seriosuly, why does everything need to be so dark and grey blue shit? Anyone feelin' then same? Like I hate this even more than the new dragon and smite changes. Let them implement the jungle and dragon but please add some colors to the game! PS: Karthus rework turned him to a blue folk aswell

**TL;DR**
Every new piece of art should not be grey-blue dark shit

EDIT: Title isn't properly spelled, should be just The colors of new champions and icons </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1) Endless glitches and bugs, Teemo Blind not applying to an enemy and he just crits me.  
2) 8 game losing streak, unlucky teamfights where, for real, 5 games the last teamfight every enemy was below 100 HP.  
3) Toxicity  
4) LP Gain and Loss  
5) Matchmaking  
I know it's useless to talk here since  you get downvoted to oblivion, but I think this was the worst day of League of me, and also the worst day of this year problably. In Real Life had some shit things too. 
And also, this ruined a bit too -  the new splashes are horrible, too detailed for a simplistic game. Jarvan 4, Rengar, Orianna, Akali had much better older splashes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically my thinking; It was fun first tme but yeah that doesnt rely on big strategy: Just TP somewhere, tell your team to kill Xerath when you can but other than thet run and kill. Just has like  Baron in the mid that gives only One person the buff. Even Hexakill was more fun although i disliked the game mode. In Ascension I jsut derp around as trollcrank and have fun. But again always I get flamed for having some fun. Some folkes take it as a Challenger promo. But ignore option is my hero 3. I like the map theme thouhg, the sandstorm added to it, thats cool but otherways not that fun again :D 
TL;DR: not so interesting, you can have some fun, i recommend to ignore ur teammates. But for me, URF is love URF is life. Ascension doesnt match anything like URF </TEXT>

<TEXT> Imo he can max crit like 1000 with that AD. I dont know that much, I know im really wrong but: Crits deal 200% dmg normally which means 864 is the max crit. So 250% crit damage means 864 which is the 200% of your AD and then the 50% from the AD which is 216 and i can get here that the max crit is 1080. Can understand myself too how can you crit with 1836 dmg. It's clearly a 8 there too </TEXT>

And I usually mute my whole team to stay focused and I dont flame. Im the one who says like np buddy, we have a chance folkes, unlucky buddy (on a death) :) Not like: You motherfucking faggot go play tetris you little piece of shit
**EDIT:** By having fun in normals I mean: SpeedUp Team, Jumping team, AD fizz, ADC Orianna, AP Nasus, 5 junglers, 5 mid and stuff like that^^ </TEXT>

A 5 sec ult what you can cast during being CC'd. Seriously fuck that shithead. Bulshit in one piece. Akali: If she has been up on farming and stuff until lvl 6 she can 1v1 everyone. Easily. Even 1v2. So fucking easy. Katarina: bullshit million dmg ultimate, NO FUCKING RESOURCE just fucking spam Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q in lane.

<TEXT> Im stuck in Silver V and im 99% that without eloboost i wont get anywhere. I quit ranked games because playing or not I will drop down still. I'm just done with ranked. I better have fun in normals than tryhard in ranked for Defeats. Had 2 promos to Silver IV, 2 losses straight in both of them and had AFK every single game. 4 games with AFK. After I played more and 10 games a day with an AFK in in. 10 STRAIGHT 4v5 not fun. So advice to people who want to climb but are stuck in division: Quit Ranked, Have fun in Normals and if  you want to have a better division name hire an elobooster </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the day before yesterday I got 2 times to Silver IV promos. And I failed both of them, and in both of them i had 2 losses immediately and guess what?! I had an AFK every promo game, 4 games with an AFK. Basically in 50% of ranked games I have an AFK. It's ridicilious. I try my hardest to get to Gold and climb in the ladder but Riot doesn't allow me too. Every game where you have an AFK and enemy team ain't retards it's instalose. 
TL;DR It's impossible to climb when you have AFK in 50% of  you ranked games. And I main support, so I can't solo carry. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-04-22 22:48:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi! Just wanted to make some things clear. First, when I read the topic of how you pick free champs and there was a point and it said: We take easier champiobs that beginners can handle and put them free for a week. So.. your ingame Champ stats show the difficulty aswell and Orianna, who is constantlty free, her difficulty is rated at 100% by you and same for Zed who indeed is a very hard champion and the same for some more constant free champions also.

I started playing on S3 and to this very moment most of the champs that are.constantly free atleast repeat over 6 weeks, but Janna is almost every week for example but.. now to a new point: some champions haven't been free for 7+ months although I believe that with 15 weeks you should be able to make all the champions atleast 1 time free (15 weeks is about 3 and a half months. 
Sidenote: Yorick last free S2 aka 2 years ago

Thank you all who read my story </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello! First post here for me but that's not the point. Since im not the oldest League of Legends player - played for only a year, I enjoy watching LCS but now it's turning boring and boring every day. You think why? Well here begins the story:
I'm a fan of those champions that are not played that much and are unique and cool, like Poppy and Twitch and Miss Fortune etc. But LCS is getting boring because of those mainstream champions that you see almost every game: Thresh, Elise, Lucian, Gragas etc.
    Today I thought I'd watch some pro player picks and I saw some NA players there that still play and I noticed TheOddOne who is a great jungler in my opinion and then i saw there: TheOddOne picks... Maokai. Then I thought that he plays Elise most of the times in LCS, but when he likes Maokai so much why not play it on LCS? When It's a good champ for you that you can handle why not play it and show it to the world how good you are with these rare champions not with mainstream junglres like Elise or Shyvana? He also likes Jarvan IV as I searched some more information about him. Why not play it on LCS, I just can't understand. Anyway I think you got my point. And if you read it all, thank you </TEXT>

And now the killcam shows that i was on his right at his eye vision. Another one: Running to an enemy and he is straight forward to me, but in a killcam im at his side. KILLCAMS ARE BROKEN!
