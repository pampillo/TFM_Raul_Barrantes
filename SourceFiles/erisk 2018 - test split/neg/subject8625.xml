<TEXT> When I was younger we used to live across from a park. There used to be this kid who lived in a government house, the most foul person you would ever meet. 

One day he decides to go to the park with this sling shot trying to shoot anything that moves. He focuses on a tree full of crows, but lucky his shitty homemade slingshot had no power and couldn't hit anything. 

Everytime I see him I tell him to fuck off or I'll call that cops. He never listens and the cops do jack shit,  anyways I look out my window one day and there he is walking to the park with this sling shot. 

I get the phone ready to call the cops again, and watch him. I yell I'm calling the cops, he ignores it and loads his slingshot. Out of nowhere rocks and other objects fall from the tree, pelting this little shit and drawing blood. 

He cries in pain, and is covering his eye with  blood streaming from his face. It turns out the crows had armed themselves with rocks and ball bearings from the local mechanic shop, and gave this guy some bird justice. 

Didn't see the little shit after that, guess they moved to a new government house. 

Crows are smart birds, but murderous in a flock.

<TITLE> How do tow truck operators bypass the law? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 10:00:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I watched a small segment about tow truck rackets operating in city suburbs. 

How it works is, the victim parks there car in an area monitored by the tow truck operator.  They haul your car off to there private impound lot, and charge you $100's of dollars to release the car. 

More information can be found here 
http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/brisbane-tow-truck-ripoff-trapping-motorists-raking-in-thousands/news-story/fafbc5bd35590ab89f1a34d05c2e6856 

The scam seems illegal, but there must be some legal ground that these operaters stand on. It just seems as if these guys operate above the law somehow. 

My question is how do business that operate in such a shoddy manner and get away with it was from a legal prescriptive?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a legal sense is there any positives or negatives from continuing a de facto relationship to actually getting married.

I recently found out that my uncle and auntie aren't actually legally married. They have lived together for 20 years plus, have had kids together, bought assets and so on. 

Just out of curiosity what are the downsides or upsides of actually getting paper married to just continuing as a de facto relationship.

<TEXT> On a positive side:

-your age is not a big issue,  there are people starting their law degrees in there 30's

-your mental issue seem to be resolved and triggers are identified

-your family situation has seem to improved

-you have a passion to study law

On the negative side:

-the law market is not improving and finding a job is becoming harder

-competition for graduate level jobs have increased significantly 

-grades,  work history,  extra curricular activities, and  networking connections fuel most hiring decision 

Overall I say you should do what makes you happy,  only you can shape the future you want,  even if it takes a bit more hard work.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do lawyers have a higher chance of becoming depressed then other professions? I think yes and no,  it depends on your work environment,  the type of work you do,  and the company you keep.  I believe that all lawyers are prone to depression just like all other professions,  just that our industry doesn't directly like to deal with it....

As someone who doesn't drink,  I dread most company sponsored events the ratio is 80% alcohol to 20% food.  Not a good environment for someone who is an alcoholic or on the brink of becoming one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The great part about conciliation is that it is more flexible and a better communication platform for two disputing parties.  The main issue you may face is who has the better leverage to exercise more power throughout the process. 

As suggested above you should try to contact a lawyer who can at least advise you of the main points of concerns,  risks,  and how to minimise these. 

Many people on here can't give you specific advice as no one knows the facts of the case. 

Best thing you can do is understand the situation,  take out all emotional bias,  prove your case based on facts,  and know your employee rights. 

Most of this information can be gathered from your employee contract,  government websites based in your state,  and free legal aid.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am curious to find out what it is like to work in the wills and estates area. 

What is the work life balance like? Would you except a lot of long hours and after hour client calls or is it better then corporate. 

What stage of your career would you interact with clients? 

Is career progression slow or fast? And I do understand this is dependent on your networking and work ethic,  but I am more interested in a general view. 

Is job market for these type of lawyers stable or erratic? 

How is the salary compared to other areas? 

Any information would be helpful  </TEXT>

You also have the academia route,  but be prepared to undertake more study and forced to churn out well researched legal based papers. 

The law recurtiment market is expanding as more hr companies are trying to make their money.

<TEXT> I don't see a real issue why you can't undertake the bachelor of law option. A JD does cost more per year than a LLB,  but in QLD they are both seen equally as I have heard.  But most people opt for a LLB as the course material is slightly easier (apparently) and the cost are significantly lower. 

Overall it is more a personal thing in Australia,  whereas in the USA a JD is more pronounced than a standard LLB. 

I believe there was an article on lawyers weekly recently summing up the real differences.

<TEXT> Do you use a yes no answer tree?  

For example for non fatal offences (e.g. Common assualt,  etc)  I found that using a flowchart that ask if the physical elements are available,  then consent and so then end up with the most suitable offence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi all,

I would like to know if anyone here used flowcharts during their exam, and is there any structure or examples commonly used?

Would you advise someone to create a flowchart for a criminal law QLD exam and is there any examples of that particular subject?
