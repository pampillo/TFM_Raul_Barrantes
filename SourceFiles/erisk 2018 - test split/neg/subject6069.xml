<TITLE> Colorless Tsukuru - curious to hear the thoughts of long-time fans! </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just finished it and I connected with it in a very profound way - but from reading reviews, I see that some fans considered a lot of what was covered in the book to be ground that was too well-tread at this point. In other words, I saw that a lot of the character traits, themes, etc, felt recycled. This is only the third Murakami book I've read and I like each one more - he is quickly becoming my favorite author. So - for long-time fans who have read the book, did you feel this way?

Also, what did you think of the ending? I was infuriated since I connected so deeply. I wanted to see a true conclusion. But I am learning from reading Murakami that he tends to leave his endings ambiguous, so it's something I will just need to accept, I suppose. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you. This is an actual link. However, it does not back up the assertion that "there is no Russian connection". It backs up the idea that there is not evidence of collusion at this time. "No Russian connection" would mean they have concluded their investigation and that they found no link. No evidence at this time, during an ongoing investigation, is not that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage by Haruki Murakami. A lot of what I've read from reviews is that this book was a disappointment to some of his fans, because it's in many ways a rehash of a lot of the same character traits, plot points, and themes from his previous books - I even noticed it even though this is only the third book of his that I've read. I really connected to the sense of isolation while living in a major city, the feeling that your friends and people you know are all unique and interesting but that you aren't, and the transition between post-college life and actual adult life. It was sort of the exact right book for me to read at this stage in my life. I hated the ending but the rest of the book was "right" enough that I could deal with it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The bitter-sweetness of seeing a book you just read back on the shelf at the library </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 04:33:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just finished reading a library book that I connected with on a deep, emotional level. I had this book for a week - in my hands, in my bed, and in my mind. I felt something for it, looked at it affectionately when it was sitting on my desk. And then I finished it and dropped it at the library.

The next day I was looking for another book. I passed by the M shelf in the fiction section and there it was - the book I'd just returned the day before. Somehow, seeing it sitting there on the shelf made me feel both happy and sad, the way you eventually come to feel about your partner after a good relationship comes to an end. You see the book sitting there and you want to pick it up again and take it home - there is a longing for it that makes you sad. At the same time you know it will bring happiness to someone else, and it makes you feel happy, in a way. I was very conflicted.

So I went ahead and bought a copy at the bookstore. That's the nice thing about books, I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did you already forget that less than 4 months ago, one of the largest protests in American history took place all across the country (organized online)? Did you miss the spontaneous protests at airports after the travel ban (spread through social media)? How about the tax marches? The march for science? Both organized online. Americans are taking to the streets in great numbers my friend. You can join them or look the other way, coddling yourself with the false premise that no one is marching and that the internet isn't a powerful organizing force that has aided tons of on-the-street activism as of late.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mygale by Thierry Jonquet. The less you know going in, the better. It's dark - creepy - unsettling - thought-provoking - and a quick read. The film "The Skin I Live In" was based on it, so there's an excellent movie to watch after you read it, as well. In fact, this is a rare case where I'd recommend watching the movie *before* reading the book - the movie is structured more like a mystery than the book, and I think going into the film without the knowledge of what you're watching is the best way to do it. The book reveals the secret earlier on than the movie does, and it's different enough that it's worth reading even if you know the general outline of the story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel that there is a legitimate grievance to be had regarding the lack of discourse in places like college campuses, where those with opposing viewpoints have their speeches shut down. The flip side of the coin is that, when they're given a platform and a place to speak, you sometimes get situations like the donald, where it quickly devolves into hate speech and validation of, ya know, genocide advocacy. For this reason I'm torn. I think it's critical for all views to be heard, and disagree when speakers are shouted down by college students. But some views and ideologies are so detestable that they really don't deserve a platform, and giving them one is dangerous. Perhaps the solution is to encourage debates rather than speeches, so that both views can be heard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After two weeks of reading books I did not enjoy, I was happy to find **Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage** by Haruki Murakami this week. This is the third book I've read by Murakami, and I strongly related to the main character in the book. That's likely part of the reason that I enjoyed it as much as a I did. The sense of isolation while living in a major city - the sense of purposelessness - the feeling that you are not unique in the way that people you know are unique and special - all of that hit home with me. The ending was infuriating, though. [With this being the third Murakami book I've read, I now expect to be left hanging a bit by the endings, but this was a particularly egregious case which put a major damper on my overall enjoyment of the book. Things build perfectly to a conversation that we never get to read. It was a major letdown.](/spoiler) If anyone else has read this book - did you feel the same way about the ending?

Next week I'll be reading Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier. Looking forward to it!

If the majority were not apathetic and were more thoughtful about the consequences of elections, we wouldn't have Trump right now and we wouldn't have Brexit now.

<TEXT> Is there really a useful equivalent between not being able to afford a phone vs being bankrupted just to stay alive or help a loved one live a productive life?

<TEXT> I just can't get into home invasion flicks. The concept itself is scary as hell. But they are so rote. 

 - Introduce subject of invasion, demonstrate the "quirk" meant to differentiate this movie from all the other home invasion movies
 - Hints of incoming invasion
 - Night falls
 - Invasion begins
 - Boyfriend/Girlfriend/Neighbor shows up
 - Boyfriend/Girlfriend/Neighbor gets killed
 - Running around the house being invaded
 - Police show up
 - Police get killed
 - Eventually it either ends in the death of the invader or the invaded

Don't get me wrong, if my house was actually being invaded it would be fucking horrible. But I feel like once you've seen 2 or 3 home invasion movies you've seen them all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Much of the time I feel it comes from people being unfamiliar with films that don't hew closely to the traditional "hero's journey". Almost every single piece of writing or film-making makes it very easy for the audience to follow the trajectory of this storytelling formula. Movies like The Witch have more of an "inward" journey, and the main character doesn't wind up back in the same place (as a character) having undergone a change after their journey. In The Witch, [she becomes a witch after her family is dead - she changes but doesn't return to the starting point.](#spoiler) This is why things like "it was all a dream after all" are so evident in movies - they provide an end cap, some kind of closure that makes a movie *feel* finished. In the Witch you don't get that - you're left in a new place. If it had ended with her [saving her family or casting a spell that resurrected them instead of joining the witches](#spoiler) I guarantee there would be fewer complaints about how nothing happened, because it would have been a more traditionally "complete" story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I finished **Pines by Blake Crouch**. I've been burned twice now by this author - this book and Dark Matter both had interesting premises that I felt wound up being squandered. I wound up skim-reading the middle third of this book - towards the end things got a bit more interesting, but any chapters involving cliff climbing or chases through the woods were uninteresting filler. Oh well - I am just really hopeful that the book I go with this coming week is a winner, as the past 2 weeks have been struggles, and that is a momentum killer. I still haven't chosen what to read yet, but I'm thinking of going with The Hound of the Baskervilles! </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1 - Yes, they're too dense. Nothing weird about that. Again, ice cream: taking a bite, enjoying it, then taking another bite is great. Cramming a giant wad of it into your face is extremely cold, painful, and unpleasant, and doing it too many times can make you feel sick. Or for horror films: well-paced scares? Great. Zombies jumping out of every available crevice each time the characters walk past one? Quickly predictable and boring, no longer tense. Have you seriously never heard the phrase "too much of a good thing"?

2 - Yes, I do understand what comedic timing is and cramming the jokes into tiny spaces *kills the timing*. The jokes don't flow because they are just spit off rapid fire at the same pace regardless of what the joke is. They don't have the right timing to make the joke work much of the time. Jokes that need to breathe or need slight pauses don't have them. Everything is just crammed into whatever tiny space it can fit in.

4 - It definitely used to have an improvised feel, especially early on. It was originally an improvised show when it was on the local network. The hosts chuckle at each other's jokes, they wait until the audience actually sees what they're talking about. and they don't all start singing songs at the exact same time. [They set it up so that they play off of each others' jokes.](https://youtu.be/Bhg2ofmCSaY?t=916) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll just explain it for you again:

 - Any pause in the show is packed with jokes, to the point where if you're laughing at one you miss others
 - They aren't timed properly (see: comedic timing) as a result of the editing and the need to cram more jokes in during each pause in dialogue 
 - The jokes are crammed in to spaces where, at times, they refer to things that haven't been shown on-screen yet
 - The show has lost its improvisational feel as a result of this, which, in my opinion, is to its detriment.

This is how "too many jokes" becomes an actual point of discussion instead of a throwaway phrase used by people who have decided to be dishonest and obnoxious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will, yeah - one nice thing about that book is that I've found I can stop reading it for a week or so, and when I pick it back up I don't feel any more confused than I did before. I have to constantly use the family tree even if I read it daily, and the events of the book just sort of flow along, so I don't feel bad about taking pauses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I completely stalled out on One Hundred Years of Solitude, so I picked up something light and quick to get over the hump. It's **Pines by Blake Crouch**. To be honest - it's not very good. It has the issue I run into with some Stephen King books where every character talks in the same voice - everyone's witty and clever in the exact same way. This was an issue with the other book of his that I read, Dark Matter. Another issue in both books is that they read more like screenplays than novels. The type is huge, the sentences are

much of the time

spaced out

like this

seemingly just to fill up the page. This makes it feel like a very low-effort affair.

The story also isn't as engaging as I'd hoped so far. It reads a lot like the Twin Peaks fan-fiction that it is. The writer is really, really trying to make his narrator and characters "quirky". One particularly egregious scene is in a diner where the narrator begs the bartender to serve him a steak even though he doesn't have money. Finally she relents and brings it to him. He then says something like "you know what I do when I order a steak rare and it comes out well done? I send it back". This is intended to evoke the coffee + pie lines from Twin Peaks, but it's a piss-poor attempt that makes no sense since he just begged for the steak for free and has no room to be picky about it. It feels shoehorned in.

To be honest, had I realized this was the same author as Dark Matter before picking up the book, I most likely would have passed on it.

I plan to finish it anyways, this coming week. I was busy with a work project so I didn't have time for much reading last week - thankfully I was a book ahead so I'm still on track! </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I understand it's a bit of an overstatement that there's an "open ban" on atheists holding office. There may be a law on the books but is it enforced? From what they said about Texas on The Atheist Experience, it's technically a law but only in the way that those quirky old laws are still laws, where you can't use the sidewalks on Sundays in Pittsburgh or use an adze before dawn in Idaho. Basically it's in the legal code but has no teeth because it's been overridden by regulations and rules created further down the line. But they don't "erase" laws, they just become unenforceable. </TEXT>

Were they *technically* paid? I guess, if you consider getting reimbursed for your entry fee as being paid. But again, that's not what is insinuated by "paid protestor". The people the article refers to walked away no richer than when they arrived. They just got to go to a free event. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That rings to me as basically being the same thing as paying their entry fee, because this is also in the source:

 The email noted that to attend the event required joining the coffee club and paying $25. "If someone does have to pay, the Party is willing to reimburse the expense," the email stated.

So essentially, since you have to be a member to attend, they are paying the attendance fee. When I heard "paid protestor", "reimbursed attendance fee which also happens to give you membership to a coffee club" is not what comes to mind. I would agree with the OP that it's semantics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Which does not account for the fact that SCOTUS only hears cases that are contentious in the first place. They turn down the vast majority of cases that come before them because there isn't enough doubt in the lower court's decision to make it worthwhile to hear those cases. So this 80% figure is misleading. It's similar for other district courts because the cases that SCOTUS hears have enough doubt to make it worth hearing, so you'd expect the high overturn rate that accompanies all circuit court decisions that go to SCOTUS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I know it was always pre-written, but previously the lines were delivered in a way that most often made it feel like it was natural flow, and they tended to be based off of what the audience had actually seen onscreen already. That's what I mean when I say "constantly reminded" - in the older episodes you can forget that it was pre-written much of the time, whereas in this season you really just feel that they're reading off of a script. In season 11 they will start referring to things that haven't happened yet, which you only see a few seconds later. There was also *some* improv in the older episodes, just not a ton. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really want to love the new season - but I find it to be unwatchable. Not because the character voices are new, not because of any casting choices, and not because the riffs aren't funny (there are PLENTY of really good ones) - those are spot on in my opinion. 

It's the pace and the timing. It's overwhelming. Not a spare second of silence goes by without commentary. It's just too much - 3 to 4 jokes per 10 seconds of time is too many to process. If you laugh, you miss the next comment. If one of them is clever enough that you need to think about it for a second, you get derailed because the next joke is already halfway done. Many of the riffs rely on things that haven't appeared on-screen yet, so it kills the vibe of "three guys riffing" and reminds you constantly that the jokes are pre-written. Since they're trying to cram 5 jokes in, they don't give any of the jokes proper timing and they just rush through them. 

This is not how the show used to be. It's frankly exhausting to watch the new season. I watched the first 2 episodes and I read here that it cools off later in the season - people pointed to episode 10 as a good example. I'm 20 minutes in and nothing about it is different. Way too fast-paced, way too many jokes instead of just keeping 1/3 of the premium-quality ones, and the timing is still completely off in many cases. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **How to Stop Worrying and Start Living, by Dale Carnegie**

This is one of the most stressful periods of my life and I am hoping this book can help. It has already given me a few interesting ideas - for example, living in "day-tight compartments" where the past is sealed off and the future is curtained - the idea is to live within this day and not focus on the past or dread the future, which is something I find myself doing ALL THE TIME. It's pretty much common sense + illustrative examples, but the common sense is packaged in ways that help you to visualize and implement it rather than just looking at is as a cliche.

Also chipping away at **One Hundred Years of Solitude, by Gabriel Garcia Marquez**. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, the timing is really off on some of them. Lots of them. Going back and watching the older episodes, most of the time it feels like comments they *could* have thought up on the fly due to the timing (though I know most of it was written) - it felt more natural. For the first few episodes (all I've seen so far) much of the time the joke starts RIGHT AWAY when a scene cuts or it sometimes starts even *before* the scene, so it just reminds you over and over that writers came up with the jokes ahead of time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My only issue is that the riffing is dense and fast for all the episodes I've seen so far (3). Just for comparison's sake I went back and watched The Crawling Eye - there are times where 30-45 seconds go by without commentary and it makes for a much better experience. It's actually kind of exhausting watching these new episodes because so much is constantly being thrown out - I can't relax with them like I do with the originals. I've heard it gets less frenetic as the season goes on though, so that's good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is definitely the furthest I've made it. I think what doesn't click for me is the writing style. It was most likely an intentional choice by the author, but no event stands out from any other event - it is basically a big list of happenings, one after another after another, so that they all blend into each other. I like the magical realism and there are some beautiful passages for sure - I just find the experience of reading it to be a bit of a slog since it's just basically a bunch of things happening without a real feeling that any event is particularly significant. Again, could have been an intentional choice by the author, but still tough to get invested in (for me anyways). </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the show they aren't interruptions though. Clay's is the main narrative... Hannah narrates a few times throughout the show, which definitely suggests that she's the central character, but it's Clay for sure. The show is more about his transformation into a vigilante than it is about Hannah's suicide. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This week I read the first big letdown of my year so far. It was **In the Dust of This Planet** by Eugene Thacker. It seemed like the perfect convergence of interesting things - there was a radiolab episode about it, it was apparently one of the influences on Rust's character in the True Detective, and I am a major fan or horror films and writing, so I expected to love it. I did, for the first 10 pages or so. Once the prologue ends, it quickly got extremely heady and tedious. It was dense, and I often had to slow down to parse what was being said, but the thing is, each time I did, the information I was rewarded with was not really worth the effort. I kept thinking to myself "OK, maybe you're right... but so what?" It felt like an ultimately empty exercise. I wanted it to delve into specific, concrete, meaningful ways that horror intersects with philosophy, but instead, it was a philosophy book that only occasionally directly interacted with horror. I think my expectations did me a major disservice with this one.

This week, I *think* I'll be struggling to finish **One Hundred Years of Solitude**. This is my third attempt - it has just never clicked for me. But I'm more than halfway done so I'm going to push myself to get it done this time.

e: I'm also very much planning to read more of Octavia Butler's stuff after reading her short story *Bloodchild*. It was so disgustingly perfect. Short sci-fi doesn't always work for me because a lot of times there just isn't enough time to establish the world and its rules before the story ends, but this one balanced it perfectly, giving just enough info along the way. I am still cringing thinking about some of the scenes though - it's truly putrid. The alien life in this book is very vivid and much more interesting than your typical alien is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know, I have tried three times to read this book, and I have never been able to finish it. I agree - it's something about the way it's written. Basically, nothing seems to be any more important than anything else, so nothing is memorable or particularly interesting. The book is basically a giant list of things that happened with no real flair or dramatic tension to build up to events. It's just "this happened. then this happened. this this happened." All three times I have tried I have thought I might finally see the magic that people get from the book, but it has never happened. I thought maybe I just had a bad translation, but there's only one and it was approved by the author, so it must represent the way he wanted the book to flow. It just does nothing for me though.  </TEXT>

It doesn't work that easily when you're going for the largest amount of votes, full stop. If his approval rating (historically low) is any indication, he wouldn't have fared well. Perhaps he would have won, perhaps he wouldn't have. It would have been a different race. Thus - speculation, which is pretty worthless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would venture to say that episode is not reflective of the rest of the show. There are definitely some disturbing + morose episodes, and overall the show is fairly dark, but something about that pig episode was "next level" in a way that the others are not. I think a lot of people are turned off (literally) by that episode and bail earlier than they should - the rest of the episodes are much more Twilight Zone than that episode is. Jumping right to season 3 and then going back to watch the first two seasons might actually be the safest move. </TEXT>

If so, during your first year, be sure to walk into town, find a good looking gal/guy, memorize their schedule, and then talk to them (and only them) every single day, sometimes giving them odd gifts. The townspeople might think you're a weirdo for wandering into town once a day and only talking to the same person, but eventually you'll have a husband or wife, so it's worth it.

<TEXT> Two ways:

1. By choosing a book with a serious hook - typically, for me, that's a mystery, a sci-fi book with a great premise, or a well-rated horror novel. I try to push myself and expand my reading horizons throughout they year, but those three genres are fallbacks for me, so if I ever feel the slump, I look to them for relief.

2. By realizing if I've set a goal that's a bit too ambitious and that I'm burning myself out trying to reach it instead of enjoying the books I read. I shot for 75 last year because I was crushing books between January and April, but at a certain point I got tired of keeping up that pace. It became "work" to stay on top of my reading goal - I was no longer really enjoying it. So I said screw it, and dropped my goal down to 50. I wound up reading 56 books, which is probably 50 more than the average person reads in a year, so I definitely didn't feel like a slacker. Basically, if you aren't enjoying the pace, there's no reason to feel bad about adjusting it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I feel that an official spokesperson for the White House should be held to a higher standard than a random person on the street, don't you? It's literally his job to speak on behalf of the White House and he's had several significant goofs already. His holding the position makes the White House looks scattered and disorganized because his briefings are scattered, disorganized, and sometimes off-message (when there *is* a clear message from the White House, which is only some of the time). I watch the briefings from start to finish live nearly every day, for what it's worth - not just clips of them posted online.

As far as the "conflation" between bombings and the refugee situation - I think the actual content of what you're referring to is that it's a bit tough to take Trump seriously and at his word that he had a sudden change of heart on Syrian children and beautiful babies when his policies on allowing refugees from that same country to enter the country are still designed to prevent it. That's not a conflation, it's an apparent contradiction on Trump's part. If he was really deeply moved by the footage he saw on CNN, he would reconsider his policy on Syrian immigration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watch the press briefings live almost every day, and I'm constantly amazed at Spicer's inability to speak clearly - he stumbles and stammers and goofs pretty much every other sentence. It might seem petty to call that out, but he's a freaking *spokesperson*, so you'd figure he could speak. Personally, do you feel it matters that the White House have a clear communicator as their spokesperson, or is it not all that important?

I agree that he has a hard job considering the mixed messages constantly coming from the White House. At the same time, he's generated some of those himself. It seems to me that the real issue is that they need someone to take charge of the message and make sure everyone is on the same page, because it certainly seems like no one is doing that right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you look at the thread from /r/AskTrumpSupporters yesterday, many of them believe he's already done more in 90 days than Obama did in 8 years. They link to a "track trump" site which gives him "in-progress" credit for a bunch of things that may or may not even wind up happening - but if he signed something "starting" them, they count it. For example, the travel ban (blocked by the courts), pipelines (conveniently doesn't show that he broke his promise on American steel), the wall (hasn't even had funding approved for it), and on and one. The three substantive things he has done are withdrawing from the TPP, making deportation easier, and getting Gorsuch on the bench. And bombing Syria I guess, but we'll have to see how that plays out, and he explicitly said he wasn't going to do that stuff - of course, the tracker doesn't reflect that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a really interesting book BUT don't expect a traditional mystery - the mystery is sort of background for the actual story being told. I wouldn't necessarily say he uses mathematical puzzles and riddles to solve the mystery, either - rather, he understands the world through numbers and images, so they are frequently used throughout the book since he is the narrator. Great book - just don't want you to have skewed expectations! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Infinite Jest is great - but don't be surprised (or distraught) if it's mid-July and you're still working on it! I read it over the course of 3 months last year and really enjoyed it - it's not as "hard" as it's made out to be, it's more a matter of determination because of the length of time it takes to read it. Well worth it in my opinion. It will start to make more and more sense as you go along - you just sort of have to let yourself absorb details as you read the first couple of hundred pages - and then things start to click. That was one of the most rewarding parts of the book for me - it makes so little sense at the beginning, and makes more and more sense as you go along. Enjoy! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This week I read **Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World** by Haruki Murakami. Holy cow, what a book. It was a mind-fuck. The writing style and the content meshed perfectly, and I will be thinking about it for a long time. What a deep, dark, satisfying, mysterious, troubling book. After finishing it, all I want to do is read more by this author, so Im extremely happy he has so many books for me to read. I think the next one Ill read is Kafka on the Shore.

Between now and when Kafka arrives in my mailbox, I will read **In the Dust of This Planet - Horror of Philosophy Vol. 1**. I started it this week and its a quickie, but I absolutely love it so far. I am a huge fan of horror, so reading about the intersection of horror and philosophy has been great. Ive already added a ton to my list of to-watch / read as well. The most interesting concept Ive come across so far is that there are really three ways we conceive of the world: Theres the world as it relates to us (known as The World), theres the world-as-it-is (i.e. everything we know about PLUS everything we dont - know as The Earth) and then there is The Planet, the world-without-us. The Planet suddenly zooms us way out to see our World as just another among many planets - something that was around long before us and which will be around long after were gone. Part of the thesis of this book is that horror is a non-pjhilosophical attempt to think about the world-without-us philosophically. If youre a horror fan I recommend checking this book out. Neat stuff so far.

<TEXT> Trump talks this way about most strong-man types. He said good things about Duterte in the Philippines. He invited Egypt's leader to the White House despite him being barred during Obama's tenure. Trump admires strongmen, that's basically the root of it.

I do think there was collusion - but I could easily see it happening without Trump's involvement. Roger Stone, Carter Page, Manafort - those are pretty shady fuckers who may have just done things on their own. With Kushner getting tied in it does seem to be a bit closer to home though. I am hesitant to make any solid guesses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really *really* doubt the moves being made are that high-level. I get the temptation to try to link this to collusion with Russia, but more than likely, there was collusion between Trump's team and Russian agents which Trump himself didn't participate all that much in or perhaps didn't know about. To suggest that all of this is a plotted, schemed out cover-up attempt is really beyond absurd - as much so as 9/11 conspiracy theories. Most of the time these things are what they look like they are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If, as reported, there is a heavy presence of paid Russian trolls on social media, that could have a huge influence on a subreddit like the donald. For every one of you (an American concerned about this issue), there could be who knows how many troll accounts voting up posts they agree with, voting down posts they don't, and commenting in support of a narrative they support. I have no doubt there are actual concerned citizens posting. But that doesn't mean a larger narrative isn't being planted and encouraged as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unmask means the names were revealed to the national security adviser upon her request. It doesn't mean they were leaked or that the people whose names were unmasked were the targets of the surveillance. In fact, it means the opposite. It means that they met with people who WERE under surveillance. Say the Russian ambassador meets with a Trump transition team member at a coffee shop. If that ambassador was under surveillance, the surveillance is also going to pick up the person he's meeting with. If that person is a US citizen, their identity is masked. In order to get context or if it's needed for security purposes, those identities can be unmasked AKA revealed to the national security adviser upon request. So like I said, it comes nowhere close to meaning Trump or his team were spied on. It means they MET with people who were being spied on and appeared on those tapes / recordings / transcripts / etc - that is the meaning of incidental surveillance. You, too, could be picked up in incidental surveillance if you're, say, the barista at that coffee shop where the Russian ambassador is meeting with a Trump associate. Doesn't mean you're the target of the surveillance or that you're being spied on - it means you're in a place where someone else is being spied on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No idea proposed by Rand Paul is going to lead to lower premiums and universal coverage. The freedom caucus opposed the bill because it didn't go FAR enough in removing protections and coverage. So no, that won't be popular either, expect maybe among the Trump supporters who aren't paying attention to what's actually in the bill. (note - not saying ALL trump supporters won't pay attention to what's in the bill - just saying that only the percentage of them who aren't paying attention it it will support it)

My larger point is that Republican ideas aren't actually popular or good for the working class, and we're going to see that more and more as they bring legislation to the table. People forgot just how bought the Republican party is. They're about to be reminded. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think anyone thinks the battle is won just because Nunes stepped down. That's one small step in draining Trump's swamp - there are many more battles to be fought and won along the way. 2018 will be just another stepping stone. It's not even remotely proven Trump was wiretapped, nor even suggested by the evidence. Trump's team was caught up in lawful incidental surveillance, meaning they met with people being monitored by the government. Nothing about that suggests Trump was wiretapped. Even "unmasking" identities comes nowhere close to that - partly because the identities aren't know until they're unmasked anyways. Hard to call it targeted when the identities of the people weren't known until they were unmasked. </TEXT>

The AHCA had a 17% approval rating. People want the pipe dream promises of Trump, where everyone gets covered and insurance is cheaper. Republican ideas don't get you there. The Republicans just passed a horribly unpopular piece of legislation on ISPs. Their ideas really aren't very good for the average person, and people will vote accordingly when they realize that.

<TEXT> The IRS specifically said he was free to release the returns. There is no reason whatsoever, not extenuating circumstances, nothing, that prevented him from releasing the returns. It's a lie. Here are several of the times he said he's release them - keep in mind that the audit is not in any way preventing him from releasing the returns:

February 25, 2015: "I would release tax returns....I would certainly show tax returns if it was necessary....I have no objection to certainly showing tax returns."

January 24, 2016: "We're working on that now. I have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful, and we'll be working that over in the next period of time....We're working on it right now, and at the appropriate time you'll be very satisfied."

February 25, 2016: "I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously."

May 10, 2016: "I'll release. Hopefully before the election I'll release."

September 26, 2016: "I don't mind releasingI'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released....As soon as the audit's finished, it will be released."

October 9, 2016: "As soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns. I'll be very proud to. They're actually quite great."

And after the election, he had surrogates say bluntly that because he won, he won't release them. Ever. And he said himself that no one cares and no one but journalists want to see them. That isn't true either. Plenty of people still want to see them. This person is a prolific liar.

I mention April 15th because that's the day after tax day. Unless I'm wrong, on that day he could release at least 2016's taxes (without violating his own (invalid, made up, false) rule about being under audit). If I'm wrong about that, OK, I'm wrong about that. Nothing about me being wrong about that changes the numerious lies and exuses provided by Trump for not releasing his tax returns. Call some of the above examples "exuses" rather than lies if it makes you feel better. Some of them are invalid exuses (which, after they're proven invalid, become lies if you keep repeating them as if they're valid) and some are flat lies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> About not being allowed to release his tax returns because he's under audit - that was a lie. He also promised numerous times to release them at some future point, but then after getting elected, just said he wasn't going to anymore. Another lie. It's even possible he wasn't under audit at all because when journalists requested to see his audit letter, they were directed to his attorneys who just said he was under audit, but wouldn't produce the simple audit letter. The guy lies constantly. On April 15th the audit excuse (which makes no sense since he's legally allowed to release them while under audit anyways) will no longer be valid, but he's already stated he won't release them anyways. He's a liar. </TEXT>

 There was a lot of that in Skyward Sword. Lot's of silliness that didn't contribute much, from mechanics to design. </TEXT>

<TEXT> BotW is largely a derivative blend of many recent trends in games. It's Ubisoft+Tomb Raider+crafting+Shadow of the Colossus+Zelda. That's not a bad thing because they took the essential elements that make each of those things great and stripped out the bad things. They perfected the formula of each element. It's not, however, an original formula by any means. It's just a really well-done blend of many things that came before it (like everything else is). </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a way I agree - but the dungeons were great in most of the older games because they often felt unique and distinct, using different mechanics and challenges in each dungeon, and their length made them memorable. The only issue I have with BotW is that the shrines and beasts are not all that distinct from one another (visually or in content), and they're short. So I totally agree that the world is amazing in BotW and I'd much rather have that than the silly portal-linking overworld of Skyward Sword - but distinct, unique, lengthy dungeons would push this game to a new level. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm, interesting point - I haven't faced ganon yet, but the game definitely does seem to get easier as you go. I still wouldn't say it's trivial - I have a tough time with Lynels and if I'm not careful, I sometimes die while exploring and getting caught by a pack of monsters I didn't see. But it definitely gets easier - a fucking weak enemy could wipe you with a single hit early on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The blights were really repetitive, I agree. And I think I did the beasts in the "wrong" order, maybe. I did the elephant, the lizard, the camel, then the bird. I think the ideal order would have been bird, lizard, elephant, camel, based on ease of beast and benefit of power you get for doing them. But regardless, the beasts got repetitive in both style and action, so I would love for them to return to traditional dungeons in future games rather than beasts and shrines. Most everything else is perfect. </TEXT>

That said, there were a couple of times where you could definitely tell he'd been sort of "out of the loop" for awhile.

<TEXT> Even though I wasn't a huge fan of the film, I thought the acting was great - very naturalistic. There were a couple of points where Robert Redford seemed to actually goof up his lines (not sure if it was an actual goof but it really felt authentic) and they intentionally kept those moments in there. It made it feel very real. One example is early on when he asks the newsroom if anyone speaks Spanish - he accidentally says "does anyone speak English" before correcting himself and it seemed like he genuinely made a mistake, but it added to the film because the rest of it is so solidly acted. </TEXT>

Allowing types of people that you don't typically see in the "prime-time" slot to embody those classic characters is very respectful if you ask me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This week, I finished **Consider the Lobster** by David Foster Wallace. I really enjoyed most of these essays, especially his review of a usage dictionary (never really thought I'd say I enjoyed a dictionary review), John McCain's 2000 campaign, and the one about conservative talk radio. The essays about Updike and Dostoyevsky were less interesting to me, but for fans of those authors, I imagine they are worth a read. What I noticed most about his non-fiction writing (this was the first non-fiction I've read by him) is that he is great at making the essay about so much more than the subject he's writing about, and at making topics you would typically see as boring (such as "American Usage" or, literally, the boredom of riding a bus and doing a tedious job for weeks on end) incredibly interesting. He's very perceptive and observant as well - there are always multiple layers to everything he writes about, and he sees it from many sides. The interweaving of his personal experience into the subject he's writing about is done very artfully. I give this a 4/5 and I'm looking forward to reading A Supposedly Fun Thing later this year.

For my book this week, I'm reading **Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World** by Haruki Murakami. I read Norwegian Wood earlier this year and really enjoyed it, though I'd heard it was his most "normal" book. I'm now on chapter 3 of HBW and that seems to be an accurate assessment. I liked a short story called Ice Man that I read by Murakami, which is what initially got me interested. I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy this book. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The majority of other posters on this subreddit are not selling anything either, or telling other people they need to read 200 books. And people who are posting here who read tons of books aren't "demanding anyone keep up" either. Anyways, that's not what you take issue with in the post I responded to, either - no mention of monetization or sale. Your issue was that you felt like people were making it a contest or comparing the number of books they've read or using it as a measure of their intelligence, dedication, or worldliness. My point is that, in the very act of publicly reporting how many books you've read (12/52), you are essentially participating in the same thing. And my larger point is there's nothing wrong with that, particularly in a subreddit specifically created for people to post about their reading goals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being convinced one way or the other is a bad idea right now. There's an ongoing investigation that will hopefully yield results. If there's an investigation, there's enough to go on to make it worth looking into. At the moment we know there was Russian meddling via the targeted disbursement of fake news in swing states. This was confirmed in the open hearing Monday. We know there were several aides and members of the Trump campaign who had meetings with representatives from Russia that they did not previously disclose or that they lied about (Flynn). We know Trump's campaign manager (for five months of the campaign) was under contract with a Russian oligarch several years ago specifically to influence politics to benefit Putin. That's some of what we know, and the intelligence communities say they know more. What does all this mean and how do all the pieces fit together? That's what the investigation is supposed to turn up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "I just kiss. I don't wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab em by the pussy. You can do anything."

Can and could have different meanings. Can do means you are able to. Could do means you theoretically could. How would he know he can if he hasn't tried? He says that he walks up and kisses people without even asking. Why would it be surprising that he grabbed a pussy too?

Look again at how the sentences interact. Just after "they let you do it" comes "you can do anything." Taken together, that essentially says "they let you do anything" - the "can" functions as an indication of assumed permission, not as "could". "Grab them by the pussy" is just an example of the "anything" that you can do. </TEXT>

And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab em by the pussy. You can do anything." That does not read as theoretical by any stretch.

<TEXT> And the inherent flaw in the idea of unmoderated free speech is that at a certain point, without moderation, one group or another will dominate the conversation and drown out dissenting voices (much like the paradox of limitless liberty and tolerance, where to meet that definition, you have to give liberty to those who would take yours or tolerate intolerance). Conversely, with too much moderation, you get /r/the_donald, where dissenting views are disallowed entirely. There is a balance that should be sought, where speech can be free within a set of reasonable guidelines. Different platforms can define what reasonable means, whether it's a company or a team of moderators. The community either tacitly agrees to that set of guidelines through continued participation, or they move on to one that better meets their definition. There are plenty of bastions of truly "free speech" on the internet, but they don't tend to be highly trafficked because they devolve into one-sided echo chamber shit holes. </TEXT>

 So both of the twin towers were hit by airplanes, and they both collapsed. The thing is, they collapsed almost exactly in the foot print of their building. When you think about a building that large coming down, and the fact that the buildings surrounding it were largely unharmed, it seems unlikely. I am not a PE (yet!), so I can't really explain this.

<TEXT> After watching hundreds of horror movies, yes, I've definitely adjusted my standards. I think of "good movies" and "good horror movies" as two separate things with separate goals now. Sometimes, though rarely, there's overlap between the two. Thrillers tend to have a higher crossover with "good movies" - but more conventional horror has lots of movies that are great at being scary (and/or fun-scary) while pretty pitiful at everything else that makes a non-horror movie good.

Thinking more deeply about it, the Catholic bent of The Conjuring might have had something to do with its popularity, too. The film exists within a framework where god and demons, etc, are accepted as being real, in a way that many other horror films are not - there isn't a layer of skepticism about the existence of god and demons in the Conjuring like there is in a lot of movies, or at the very least, the question is firmly answered in the film. I haven't seen it in some time, but I remember walking away from it almost feeling like it was a "Catholic film", kind of like when you hear Christian rock and know it's Christian rock even if they *don't* say Jesus all the time. It felt "safe" for Christians/Catholics et. al. to watch, if that makes any sense at all. </TEXT>

I love horror, but I can recognize that, aside from the horror elements, many of my favorite horror movies are otherwise not very solid films. The Conjuring is a watchable film even for people who aren't horror fans. It's not a top-tier horror movie, but it's coherent and functional as a film *outside* the horror elements, so I think it has broader appeal than most conventional horror. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm reading *Consider the Lobster* right now and there are two essays in it that are very interesting to compare to the modern political environment. 

One follows McCain's 2000 campaign during the primaries. He was, in a much more dignified and respectable manner, the Trump of that election cycle - outspoken, an "outsider"/maverick, and someone that people felt was being genuine when he spoke to them (whether or not he actually was). And yet the big "scandal" in that campaign was that Bush and McCain had a handshake agreement not to campaign negatively against each other, an agreement that was broken with comparatively mild rebukes. The stuff Trump pulled in the race (and is continuing to pull) would have been in a whole different stratosphere.

The other essay is about conservative talk radio. The themes of hyper-partisanship and echo chambers is still very relevant today. Worth a read, imo. </TEXT>

If you like journalism, Jon Ronson has some funny and entertaining books. *Lolita*, while disturbing, is also hilarious. Kurt Vonnegut has some very funny books - Cat's Cradle and Sirens of Titan are my favorites by him.

<TEXT> I would say that's more of a rationalization based on outcome than an actual way of reading his actions, don't you think? Using that logic, anything that doesn't play out in his favor can be deemed long-term 4D chess that hasn't paid off yet, and anything that succeeds can be called successful 4D chess. Basically, using that logic, it's impossible for him to lose. With that in mind, it seems more like a justification than a realistic read of what's happening.

Considering Trump was full-throated in his support of the healthcare bill, and that he, along with his staff, spent many long days twisting arms in congress to get it to pass, do you think he would have been upset if it had passed?

If the new bill that goes to the floor (if there is one) looks a lot like the previous one, and Trump supports it, will you consider that actual support and endorsement? </TEXT>

<TEXT> News and news commentary are two different things. Those "whitelash" type comments are news commentary and analysis. They even introduce those people as analysts - a panel of analysts, not as anchors. Their job is to discuss the issues, not just report the news, and bias/political leanings will always play into that. In fact, that is the entire purpose of those segments. To foster a debate and conversation between the panelists *about* the news, not to report it. CNN doesn't do a great job of it because they're a corporate media outlet mostly concerned with ratings, but regardless, a straight-up news cast is a different thing than a commentary panel. Conflating the two as simply being "news" makes little sense, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> "To what degree" is a nonsensical question. As Nye says, it's the rate of change, the rapid change, that is concerning. We would expect to see changes in the climate - ups and downs over long stretches of time. As Nye says, it's unclear that we would have gotten to a point, at all, ever, where the temperature changed this quickly - so Carlson's question "how long would it have taken without humans" makes no sense, because we wouldn't get there at all without humans. We'd experience the normal ups and downs of the cycle, with temperatures gradually rising and falling rather than rapidly peaking. Think of it as putting a pot of water with an egg in it over low heat for 5 minutes, then putting it in the fridge for five minutes, vs throwing an egg in the fire for 2 minutes and then covering it in ice for 2 minutes. The temperature of the egg is rising and cooling, but the rate of change makes a huge difference in what happens to the egg. Talking over someone trying to explain that while wearing a stupefied expression that suggests what the other person is saying is ludicrous is not engaging in an honest debate, is it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nice! Since you've read them, if you feel like checking out a podcast that was a lot of fun to listen to, there's one called Alohohomora where they do a chapter by chapter reread of the series. I really liked listening to an episode after each chapter. They made it all the way through the seven books, finishing up last year. The first 10ish episodes are a bit rough, but they get into a groove and get better as they go.

Also, the illustrated editions are totally awesome! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can agree with this on everything except the Gorsuch nomination. By all accounts he's not in any way "compromised" in the way that everyone else associated with and/or appointed by Trump may be compromised. The danger of filibustering Gorsuch's nomination is that the Republicans will go nuclear and eliminate the need for 60 votes - meaning that next time, Trump can nominate *whoever he wants*, and all it will take is a simple majority to put them on the bench. If Trump *doesn't* get impeached and has the opportunity to nominate a second judge... we might be fucked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was amazed at how much I enjoyed reading it - it was the first thing I read by him. It has a reputation for being really difficult, and it did definitely take perseverance and 200 pages (plus many more of footnotes) worth of investment for payoff to start happening - but it was really funny and very insightful, so it didn't ever feel like a chore. Similarly, if someone told me I'd enjoy reading a review of a dictionary, I'd think they were crazy - but this is a fascinating essay, and just like Infinite Jest, very funny, too. </TEXT>

He also talks a bit about his childhood in this chapter - he was using words as a 12 year old that I have never even heard of before. There is also a pretty clear parallel between Avril Incandenza and his own mother with their grammar policing tendencies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No one would pride themselves on the opposite, but it seems that Trump's only substantive claim about his political skill during that campaign was that he is good at hiring. He hasn't expressed in any tangible way that he has acumen aside from that. You'd expect that a good leader would have other qualities aside from delegation to brag about - qualities like an inspiring personality, a highly-informed point of view that can lend valuable guidance, or passion and keen insight. Trump hasn't expressed or demonstrated any of that. Instead, he just says he picks good people to make decisions for him.

To be fair, he does claim to be a great negotiator as well - but I think recent evidence suggests otherwise, at least in the political realm, and I'm not sure he's provided any evidence of his negotiating skill (in a public forum anyways) in the business world either. It might be lurking in *The Art of the Deal*, but not having read it, I couldn't say. </TEXT>

And just to rant for a minute - if God has a plan for everything, do prayers change that plan? If god's all-knowing, wouldn't he know that change would happen beforehand? Meaning he didn't really change his plan, he just followed it. Meaning your prayer was foreknown and the change was already locked in place. Meaning there's no real freewill. All around it's a goofy system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last week I read two books since both were on the short side:

1. **The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time** by Mark Haddon. I really enjoyed this book, and it was quite a bit different from what I expected. In my mind I'd always pictured this being similar to that movie Brick about the high school detectives - but it turned out to be an interesting portrait of a kid with autism. I liked the way the author incorporated drawings since it fit so well with the narrator's personality. The first half of the book was stronger than the second, I felt, but it had a great conclusion.

2. **Multiple Choice** by Alejandro Zambra. This was a blend of poetry and short fiction in the format of a multiple choice test. There were a ton of interesting things about this book, and the format actually lends quite a lot to the experience. The first section is "fill in the blank" sentences, where you choose from a list of words, and often times, replacing a word or two changes the meaning of the sentence and creates a cool, contemplative experience. For example:

 I want to gather these words together, ________ nothing makes any sense.

 A) though

 B) so that

 C) even if

 D) but

 E) until 

I think my favorite from this section was:

 Last night I dreamed you were a ______ and I was a ________ and we were ________ together.

 A) dog  dog  barking

 B) leg leg dancing

 C) tooth tooth biting

 D) nun priest sleeping

 E) ghost ghost always

There are several other sections like this, such as one where there are a few options on the order of sentences, where, again, the order changes the meaning of the paragraph, and there are a few short stories at the end. I loved it overall - lots of themes explored, like loss, ennui, nostalgia, and of course, love.

---

This week I'm reading **Consider the Lobster** by David Foster Wallace. This is my first dip into his non-fiction after reading Infinite Jest last year. I'm really enjoying it so far - he has a very analytical perspective. I think I may also read **The Hounds of Baskerville** alongside it. </TEXT>

The shitty thing is that Republicans may now do nothing to attempt to fix the issues they see with Obamacare and they'll "let it fail", blaming that on democrats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> However, none of those Republicans campaigned on the idea that they'd cover everyone and that everyone's premiums would go down, etc. Trump did. He backed them into a corner - Republicans in congress would have been fine with a straight repeal and working on a new system (probably not the smartest move, but it would have been doable in congress). Trump set expectations that were completely un-achievable under any Republican approach. It's lose-lose for them because of that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem (well, A problem) is his laser-focus on keeping his campaign promises, whether or not the solution is a good one. Sure, this bill would have "repealed Obamacare", or at least would have let him say it did, but it was a piece of shit bill that would hurt his own voters. The Wall was supposed to be paid for by Mexico, if I remember correctly, but now it's in his 2018 budget. He just wants to be able to say he did what he said he was going to do, but doesn't care at all about whether those are actually good things to do, or about how he gets them done. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump is the ultimate illustration of privilege and its hollowness. He gets into office and the stock market goes up and we get a better than average jobs report. He takes the credit for it because he created a "positive business environment" just by being there, despite the work put in over the past 8 years to revive the dead economy left us by the previous Republican in office. So he's done nothing other than get elected and markets get a boost from it - fair enough, markets do what markets do and business "feels" more confident with Trump in office. No need to mention that he's inheriting a functional, growing economy, right? Rather than having to turn an economy in nose-dive right side up, as was his predecessor's task. That's the same privilege at work that Trump has benefited from his entire life. Other people work hard and he gets credit for by mere fact of existing (see: Fred Trump, for starters).

And now we get to see how his actual governing and leadership impact things, if anything actually ever gets done on that front. We'll get to see just how far in the hole we wind up after however many more years of this cluelessness we have to deal with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last week I finished **A Walk in the Woods** by Bill Bryson. I am a hiker and I worked at one of the visitor's centers mentioned in the book, in addition to having hiked some of the New England portions of the trail. I am also a fan of Bryson's from some of his other books, so this was a hit for me. He's a very perceptive person and a good researcher, so I always feel that I gain a good insight into the topic when I read his books. I was a bit surprised to see some negative reviews on goodreads where people bemoaned Bryson's negative attitude and judgmental tendencies - he's an equally harsh critic of himself as he is of anyone else, his "superior feelings" are nearly always ironic (because he's a notorious bumbler), and the awe and appreciation he often expresses balance out his grumblings (which are frequent - but humorous). I guess it just comes down to things working for some people and not for others!

I started **The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time** and I'm a fan so far. It is in the tradition of Flowers for Algernon and The Sound and the Fury in that it offers a perspective you don't often see from a narrator. I appreciate the way the author works his narrator's tendencies into the book through the use of graphs and images, and it's also very entertaining. Since this is a short book I'm also going to start **Consider the Lobster**. I haven't read any of David Foster Wallace's non-fiction but I'm pretty excited about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it were a more consistent theme throughout the films, it would fit better. It was also a strangely-framed scene - having no music actually does a much better job of conveying the awkwardness of the scene. Including the music puts you more in Peter's mind rather than the perspective of an observer seeing a weirdo snapping and strutting down the street.

<TEXT> Yes, absolutely - the story is about the specific instance shown in the video, where Trump appears to refuse a handshake after being asked by both Merkel and a reporter. The subheading of the article is: "President greeted German leader with handshake upon her arrival but appeared to ignore requests to do so as the pair sat together in front of TV cameras". I am guessing most people posting photographs of them shaking hands and calling it fake news didn't even open the article. They shook hands earlier in the day, and Trump's body language and decision to ignore requests for a shake after the closed-door meeting indicate that something happened over the course of that meeting to sour relations between them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was the claim that Trump didn't Merkel's hand at all? No, it was that he refused to shake her hand. Which he appears to have done in this instance, as he was asked both by her and by a reporter, and he acknowledged neither. He was just fine with shaking it before their meeting - once they sat down behind closed doors, something appears to have happened, as Trump emerged looking like a chastened child. In fact, if you read more than the headline, you'd have seen that the first thing under it is: "President greeted German leader with handshake upon her arrival but appeared to ignore requests to do so as the pair sat together in front of TV cameras" </TEXT>

Someone walks by and wants to chat - or I get pulled into a meeting I don't really need to be in - or I'm halfway through the 5 minute walk to get to the bathroom and someone calls my name from down the hall... it is really amazing when I compare the amount I'm able to get done from home, where I get to sit down and actually focus, vs being in the office. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, it's absolutely worth the vague notion of "the degradation of the prestige of the office" to get universal health care codified in law. Once the US gets universal health care it's very unlikely we'll ever go back. Getting there is nearly impossible and there's no chance it's going to happen under Trump with a republican congress. But if it did, in this fantasy world, it would absolutely be worth a hit to the prestige of the office. That can be remedied and rectified later. Universal health care would be an unimaginably important step forward. Any chance to get it needs to be taken advantage of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This leaves us in the scenario we had before the ACA, where people went bankrupt and/or couldn't find insurance to cover them because they were ill and insurance companies didn't want to cover them since it would cost them to do so. There are some areas of life where it makes sense to have some government protection of the people. Defense is one - health care is another. We're literally talking about the health and wellness of the population - there's no reason we need to leave that up to the whims of for-profit businesses when a better solution has been demonstrated by pretty much every other developed nation in the world.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doesn't insurance only work if people who aren't using it pay into it? That's how most forms of insurance work - you pay for it when you aren't using it so that you can use it, and other people pay into it when they aren't using it so that you have it when you need it. If everyone who is paying into it is also using it at that exact moment, there aren't funds in the account to cover everyone. That's why you need healthy people paying into it - and the healthy people have it in the event of an accident or if they do wind up developing a condition for which they need care. There are definite fixes that need to be made to balance costs for healthy people, but fundamentally speaking you need to have healthy people (such as you and I) paying into the system for it to work at all. Right? </TEXT>

That's how you avoid clumsy bullshit like "admittedly more situationally capricious than particularly courageous." Get rid of half of the words and the meaning is far clearer.

And "ubiquitous trait" is a terrible way of describing a part of the human body. A neck/skull is not really a trait, and if he meant to refer to its fragility, "property" would have been better than trait. 

Finally, you would in fact not be surprised to find something "common" if it were ubiquitous, since that's exactly what being ubiquitous means. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, that was not the question posed to Sessions. The question wasn't even about Sessions' meetings. The question was what Sessions would do as AG if he discovered that anyone associated with the Trump had met with Russia during the *course of the campaign*, not *about* the campaign. And Sessions took it upon himself to deny having met with Russian officials despite not being asked about that. He didn't specify that he had actually met with them, just not about the campaign. He said he hadn't met with them. In other words, he lied, and his excuse is bullshit. It's the cover-up, not the crime, that's the problem - that is, unless the crime is worse than what we've led to believe and they actually *were* colluding with Russia during the campaign - in which case the crime is definitely worse and the reason for the lies starts to make a lot more sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> These people were terminated (asked to resign) effective immediately and no indication was made that there were replacements ready for them. Typically, as in Obama's tenure, replacements are phased in over time and appointees are given notice to prepare. There are hundreds of other positions in Trump's government that are unfilled at this point, and no indication has been made that these or any of those other positions have ready replacements. There's either a lack of replacements or a lack of transparency - come Monday morning, we'll know for sure which, as 46 attorneys' desks will be empty.

Also, for some reason you're reading a bunch of things into my comments for which there's no evidence whatsoever - I'm not surprised by that, as Trump makes baseless accusations on a frequent basis and provides no evidence for them, so it's in his mold. If you can point to somewhere in this conversation where I've come across as "aghast, threatened, and frightened" rather than simply conversing with you, I'll give you a high five. The reality is that you're making bad arguments and you know it.

The bottom line is that phasing appointed positions out over time and having replacements ready for them is the reasonable and responsible way of handling this.

Some of them are, of course, convinced that it's a genius political ploy by Donald - that he *wants* it to fail so that he can "write his own bill". It's pretty entertaining and worth checking out any thread on health care over there right now.

e: when you can find threads on health care there, that is. I've only seen a few. For some strange reason they aren't all that excited to talk about it... </TEXT>

Same thing with Obamacare. He said they'd repeal it so much that he's forced to back the piece of shit bill going through congress right now. You should see /r/the_don right now - they don't know how to take the fact that Trump is lobbying so hard for "Obamacare-lite" drafted by the evil Paul Ryan. Well, some of them don't know how to take it - others are of course convinced that this is a master strategy by Trump and that he WANTS it to fail (even though he's lobbying hard for it) so that he can write his own bill... if that makes absolutely no sense to you, you're having the logical reaction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Typically, dystopian work uses symbolism and hyperbole to exemplify and criticize current and historical events and trends. In Puritan society, men governed, women were not allowed into positions of community leadership, they were expected to fulfill certain roles, primarily as mothers and homemakers. Gilead is an extreme version of that meant to illustrate the psychological and sociological impacts that kind of powerlessness has on people and societies. The parallels people see in current politics are not that women are going to be forced to birth children against their will or wear hoods that control what they can or can't see (again, that's symbolism) - but that the people in power would contribute to the erosion of women's rights and advocate for more "traditional" gender roles, removing autonomy and choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are too many weird things related to Russia with this administration that it seems likely that something strange is going on behind the scenes. Why do people keep lying about meetings with Russian officials? The story keeps changing. Why did Trump staffers work to soften the GOP's statement on aiding Ukraine in standing up to Russia? Why do many of Trump's positions and appointments happily align with Russian interests? Why did he constantly praise Putin during the campaign? Trump openly requested that Russia continue to hack and release DNC documents. Among all of that, each individual instance might raise eyebrows but would not be a huge deal. But all of these oddities keep piling up, and the fact that Trump's people aren't being straight-up about these meetings really looks dirty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the long view you imply is stretching plausibility. The people in control want to remain in control, consolidate power, and make as much profit as possible. That much is certain. Where it goes off the rails is the "wait until the birthrate drops, etc" part. That's Alex Jones FEMA camp material. I can see why it's tempting to go down that rabbit hole, especially considering this insane leak today. But why is it not more logical to simply stop at "these people want power and money" than to continue down the road to "they want depopulation by attrition"? Unless the idea is that these people plan to like for like 400 years on the blood of children, there's no reason to think it's about anything more than immediate power and profit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw what happened after 9/11 and I know what a republican president will do in reaction to a serious terrorist attack. It led to two wars, thousands of lost lives, and the erosion of civil liberties. Trump will be a whole different level of overreaction and the toll will be multiplied massively. The political ramifications are no small matter - they will lead directly to the loss of human life - probably on a scale we haven't seen in a long time. So yes, that's what I'm most concerned about, because we haven't even seen how much Trump will overreact to a small-scale terror attack, let alone a large one. If his actions so far are any guide, it will be a horrifying thing to witness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although I STRONGLY disagree with this ban and agree with the DHS that this ban actually undercuts our ability to fight terrorism, I have to wonder if, in the grand scheme of things, it's best if this holds up in court and goes into effect. I am picturing the absolutely disastrous fallout if at some point a person from one of these countries who immigrates to the US or comes here as a refugee from Syria commits a terror attack. It hasn't happened yet but that doesn't mean it won't happen - and the overreach, clamor for war, and consolidation of power under Trump if an attack like that does happen will be UNREAL and earth shaking. I am really scared for what's going to happen after a terror attack of some kind happens here, because it's basically inevitable that SOMETHING is going to happen at some point no matter what we do to prevent it. Coda: I mean "radical islamic terror" rather than the right-wing terror we've already seen, which Trump has taken no real steps to stymie. </TEXT>

It's a strawman, which is unnecessary when the actual argument Trump is making is already unfounded and crazy.

And none of it points to Obama wiretapping Trump Tower. It points to the FBI getting FISA warrants to monitor several members of the Trump campaign for possible collusion with Russia.

<TEXT> Watched the entire thing - nothing backs up the claim that Obama asked for Trump tower to be wiretapped, or even that the executive branch made the decision to center an investigation on the Trump campaign. Everything he talks about in the video has been known for a long time now: the FBI obtained FISA warrants on several members of Trump's campaign, and they along with 5 other agencies followed up on suspicions they had of Trump's campaign's possible collusion with Russia. None of what he reviews in this video does any favors for Trump, either... and this video definitely does not "break down Trump wiretapping claims" considering the claims were that Obama tapped Trump Tower.

<TEXT> This week I finished **The Handmaid's Tale** by Margaret Atwood. It was on my "to-read" shelf for years and I finally decided that, with a TV series being made out of it later this year, I ought to read it. It was great - terrifying, but great. Scarier still is the idea that there are actual theocracies like the one depicted in the book in full operation in parts of the world. It's also creepy to imagine how an erosion of our civil liberties could lead us from the kind of world we live in now, here in the US, to a world like the one in the book. A lot would have to change, but simultaneously, not much would have to change. With the wrong people in control, the slippery slope towards theocracy could easily drop us into a Gilead situation. I would hesitate to make any direct real-world comparisons since at this point they would be overblown, but there are definite parallels between the trends we've seen over the past 40-50 years (with dips and peaks, not a direct line) and the way things play out in the book. And of course, that's the point.

I am rereading **The Golden Compass** this week - when I heard that there would be a new trilogy set in the world of His Dark Materials I knew it was finally time for me to reread these books. They were my favorites when I was a teenager and I am extremely excited to get back into them.

Breath of the Wild has been eating up a little too much of my time, but I hereby swear to myself that I won't let it derail my reading goal this year! </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a strange reading of it considering he said "Trump is famous for firing people" and that that's exactly what he and many others want him to do. Not so much an inevitability, as you put it, but an actual feature they were looking for. In reality Trump claimed he was going to put "the best people" in these positions, and instead, as you put, he has found people who were poor fits for the job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump knew about Flynn for almost 2 weeks before he fired him, and ONLY did so once it became public knowledge. Same with Sessions - he ONLY took action after his meetings became public knowledge. This is not taking responsibility, it's damage control. They keep trying to sweep this under the run and it keeps growing in scope with no signs of stopping anytime soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, strange how his decision to recuse himself came only *after* it was made public that he had met with the Russian Ambassador, not before we knew about it - kind of like how Flynn was asked to resign only *after* his meetings became public knowledge even though Trump had known about it for almost 2 weeks at that point. So strange how those things just happen to coincide with damaging news reports... </TEXT>

<TEXT> You created your own copypasta and gave me that instead of bothering to read my comment, that's cute.

The Franken question wasn't even about Sessions specifically - it was about "anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign" and what Sessions would do if it was discovered that any of them had communicated with the Russians *during the course* of the campaign - not *about* the campaign, an important distinction. Sessions chose to make it about himself, (even going so far as to mention that he has been called a Trump surrogate!)when he didn't even have to - and said he did not have any communications with the Russians, full stop.

You can try to spin this however you'd like - and just keep telling yourself, "the leaks might be real, but the news is fake!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Officials from the Justice Department. Any thoughts on why they choose to remain nameless? Perhaps because it would have catastrophic consequences for them if their identities were revealed. You also realize, I would hope, that these officials are not nameless to the reporter - the reporters keep them nameless in print as a condition on the part of the leaker. 

You'll notice from the reaction to this from congresspeople on both the left and the right sides of the aisle that this report has major traction. I am very curious to see what the fallout is - I expect it will be something similar to Flynn, where it becomes a big enough story that Sessions has to go. But if it makes you feel better over the next few days, just listen to daddy when he tells you "the leaks are real, the news is fake". </TEXT>

I think an automod post for the weekly thread would be completely fine, since it's a routine post that doesn't really change week to week. I understand wanting a personal touch, but don't think the weekly thread needs it - so since it would make life easier for the mods *and* more consistent for community, my vote is on automod for the weekly book thread! For a personal touch, whoever is responsible for monitoring the automod could add in their book ahead of time to customize the post each week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, it's largely about how society perceives you, actually. Think about Mulan. She dressed up like a dude and was allowed into the army - not because she identified as a man (she didn't), but because she was perceived as a man. It is largely societal perception from which things like privilege are derived. "Passing", as it is sometimes called.

<TEXT> ANYONE who actually THOUGHT about it knew! It's a complicated issue, duh! There is a reason the ACA was a massive bill - because you can't do healthcare legislation in a piecemeal way and expect insurance providers to get on board with it. For insurance providers, the stuff they like (individual mandates, for example) and the stuff they don't like  (required coverage of pre-existing conditions) has to be packaged into the same bill. They will not sign onto piecemeal legislation that has the "bad stuff" only, with the expectation that the "good stuff" will come down the road. Alternately, they will only get on board with legislation that benefits them, if done in a piecemeal way, and will not get on-board with anything that doesn't. It's a complicated issue and there is not a simple solution (other than single-payer of course...). </TEXT>

<TEXT> This film is offered as one of the free films you can watch on United flights, so I gave it a shot while flying last week. Even on a plane, without much else to do, I could only make it 30 minutes in. 10 minutes after the character intros ended I just had to bail. Everything about it was just unpleasant - the tone, the characters, the pacing, the exposition dump, the lighting, all of it. I had the same experience with BvS - got to the "court room piss" scene and just had had enough at that point. 

e: sidenote about that flight, for the first time in my life I witnessed someone purchasing one of those "snack boxes" that they sell for like 8 bucks. Never seen someone actually pull the trigger on those before. And this was like a 2 hour flight, not a long haul. Took me aback to say the least. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say you have to get to know someone before you can decide if they're a good guy - which is obviously an inherently subjective idea. I have met people who have broken the law who I would describe as good people (I'll bet you have too) - and people who are, as far as I know, law-abiding but are complete assholes. It is not possible to determine whether or not someone's a good person just by whether or not they own a gun. If you know someone has a gun, that is all you know about them. All other characteristics have to be determined from that point onward. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright, I will look into it. I would argue that even if crime rates are low in areas where people own guns, it does nothing to further the idea that gun owners are "good guys" rather than just guys. Following the law is pretty much a bare minimum standard - it means you are a normal person operating within the bounds of the law. Your reasons for doing that can be wide and varied - maybe people aren't breaking the law in these areas for fear of getting shot. That doesn't mean those are more likely to be good poeple people than those in areas with low gun-ownership rates - it means the consequences of breaking the law are higher in areas with high gun ownership rates.

Whether or not someone can be called a "good guy" is, again, not related to whether or not they own a gun. Those are two entirely separate things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This week I finished off **Authority** by Jeff Vandermeer. I LOVED the first book, Annihilation. This was a major change of pace, and in my view, a step down. It was very cool that the author was willing to depart so much from what made the first book as compelling as it was - but there just wasn't enough in this book. I feel that it would have worked very well as a short story or novella. But at novel length, there was just too much deliberation and padding. There is one AMAZINGLY creepy scene that made the book worthwhile for me, but I just wish there could have been more of that and less directionless wandering. I don't need all my questions answered - far from it - but too much of this book went nowhere for me to be satisfied coming away from it. The "big event" just sort of... happens, all of a sudden, in a very vague way. Overall I did not enjoy it. I might eventually read the third book but I'm not going to jump into it, that's for sure.

I am now reading **The Handmaid's Tale** for the first time. I'm 20% in an absolutely loving it so far. Really scary stuff.

Sidenote, I'm watching The Handmaiden now, a 2016 film directed by the Korean filmmaker of the original Oldboy. Amazing film so far. </TEXT>

He *can't* "replace" members of congress so that's a pointless addition to your comment. He claimed with no evidence that 3 million people voted illegally because he lost the popular vote (the scary part of that is that he seems to be refusing to accept the results of an election he WON - how do you think he'll react to an election he loses, if that happens in 2020?).

<TEXT> Eh, to me that hearkens back the idea that rural voters in the states that swung for Trump have votes that "count" more than those in more populated areas. The percentage each vote counts for in rural districts (which largely went for Trump) is much higher than in more densely populated districts with big cities. Fewer voters means each vote has a higher percentage value in determining the outcome of that state.

i.e.: 5 people vote in district A: each vote is worth 20%

20 people vote in district B: each vote is worth 5%

Cities went for Clinton (and usually go D) - rural districts went Trump (and usually go R). So rural (Trump) voters do in fact have votes that "count" more - i.e. a disproportionate voice. </TEXT>

We have emails revealing that intent - we DON'T have recordings of phone calls they made. We DON'T have transcripts of conversations they had in person.

<TEXT> That's a bit disingenuous. They talked about 
*getting someone to ask* about his religious affiliation because they knew it would probably have an impact on how he was received in a couple of states:

 It might make no difference, but for KY (Kentucky) and WVA (West Virginia) can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.

They didn't just casually ask what his affiliation was. They wanted him to be asked publicly (on a debate stage) because they thought it would impact his reception in Kentucky and West Virginia. People should not be pretending that the DNC didn't do what it could to undermine support for Bernie Sanders.

<TEXT> You only have to look to the comments section and see what the audience of Brietbart articles has to say to find why it's an extremist site. The content on that site is written to inflame a very particular group of people. Here were the first two comments from their article on Leslie Jones when I opened it just now (top headline at the moment):

 I rather have harambe than this ugly tranny

and

 That is one fugly n***r woman.

Would you say that Breitbart just "accidentally" has an audience that posts shit like that? Remember that Breitbart is not a content aggregation site like reddit, where users post links to articles - Breitbart has a staff of writers who create this content. And it *just so happens* that the comments section of every article is filled with hateful, horrible shit. It's no accident. This content is created to pander to this audience. 

Reloaded the comments and these are the newest:

 This is why people go to the zoo. Nature is amazing.

and

 We got a gorilla onstage.

It's a never-ending stream of hatred, racism, bigotry, etc from their audience. It's not an accident - this is their platform. The articles don't have to say these things explicitly but they know exactly who they're talking to when they write them. It is an extremist site.


Edit:


Another fresh one:

 Light that afrosheen on fire , and watch run around like Richard Prior...lol
That would be funny...

Just reload and enjoy, it's never-ending. Somehow the NYT, Washington Post, etc manages NOT to have comments sections filled with this... wonder why? Perhaps because they aren't extremist sites.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am somewhat concerned about the constant "he should be impeached, but the cowardly senate will do nothing about it" or "the spineless republicans will never hold hearings on this issue" refrains that I see on every single one of these articles. It conflates all these issues as if they hold the same weight and have the same importance. Some of these things are HUGE deals. Every single one isn't. Some of them may or may not be. But just relying on the idea that "the weak republicans won't dare to investigate this" line makes it impossible for the average observer to discern which of these things actually IS worth investigating and creates parity between all these offenses, some of which are not abnormal - they just went unobserved before. It also creates an incredibly monotonous, oddly normalizing ecosystem for these stories. There is nothing to be gained from comments sections on these articles because they ALL say "wow, if only the republicans had the guys to investigate this. But they don't!" EVERY SINGLE ARTICLE has this same string of comments, most often multiple times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was for executive employees only, and also removed the two year ban on informal lobbying, which is the same thing as lobbying except you aren't registered as a lobbyist. Additionally it removed a two year restriction preventing executive branch employees from taking a job with an agency they had tried to influence. So that order was very limited in scope to begin with and is a total mixed bag. In many ways it's window dressing because it applies to a tiny fraction of people and it just pushes the lobbying under the table.

<TEXT>  Colbert was taking orders from the Clinton campaign

No, the Clinton Global Initiative, back in 2013, pitched Colbert for 2 episodes that had content on the CGI University. That is not "taking orders from the Clinton campaign", as you phrase it, which would imply a much more far-reaching, insidious involvement between Colbert and the actual Clinton campaign, which the CGI U was not anyways. So if that's all you've got it's weak sauce.

To address your second point, I simply offered a warning to Trump and his supporters - don't get comfortable convincing yourselves that all this outrage is astroturfed or it's going to bite you hard in the ass in the next election cycles. However, if you feel that cavalier about the idea of changing the constitution I'm not sure how much respect you have for our system of governance anyways...

The third paragraph is more or less a rant so, OK, I understand that you feel that way. Hollywood celebrities are generally not the people to turn to for incisive political commentary or reasoned thought regardless of your political affiliation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TPP death I'll grant you, that was good, so he does have one good thing.

The lobbying ban did not apply to "politicians", only to employees of the executive branch, and it also *removed* the two year ban on informal lobbying, which is the same thing as lobbying except you aren't registered as a lobbyist. Additionally it removed a two year restriction preventing executive branch employees from taking a job with an agency they had tried to influence. So that order was very limited in scope to begin with and is a total mixed bag. In many ways it's window dressing that just pushes the lobbying under the table.

Many people have advocated for term limits, that's nothing new, but it won't happen anyways. It's an easy position to take since there's no political cost or work involved for the president - congress has to pass that themselves, and it ain't happening. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well that's an interesting take on it. Did the DNC donate to comedy central and HBO? First I've heard of that - otherwise I'm pretty unclear on which "party" gave "them" money to "campaign" - those are all pretty nebulous claims. Isn't it perhaps more likely that they are comedians who have an audience that they perform for that enjoys this kind of material? 

Not everyone that disagrees with you is a shill involved in a liberal conspiracy, you know, whether it's me or John Oliver - Obama learned that in the 2010 midterms after the Tea Party was largely dismissed as astroturfed but wound up sweeping congress. Trump's about to learn that lesson in 2018 and 2020 if he and his supporters keep telling themselves this is all fake outrage funded by George Soros and propagated by the leftist media elite. The voters will teach him otherwise.

Hate to say it but I'm not spending 30 minutes watching that video this time either, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> His bungling of the first big move of his presidency (the immigration EO) revealed the disarray and incompetence of his administration, so I would not be at all surprised if some of his supporters were less than thrilled with him so far. Once that EO was blocked the Trump Train slowed wayyyy down. He got BTFO. Now they have a huge mess on their hands in finding an actual replacement for the ACA after promising it over and over - that's going to be a nasty fight. The investigation into the campaign's ties to Russia are stepping up after Trump kept a known liar on his national security council for more than 10 days after he found out he lied - only asking him to resign once the media got hold of it. The EO's he has signed so far have also been almost entirely symbolic, clarifying priorities for other organizations. He hasn't done much of anything, honestly, other than starting to deport mothers and fathers instead of focusing on the criminals. Tbh it's a fail so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And like the person above said... they never claimed to be fair and balanced or actual news. They claim to be comedy shows, which they are. Partisanship and comedy are not on the same spectrum - comedy doesn't have to appeal to everyone to be comedy, or to be non-partisan to be comedy. I think you are seeing some kind of negation between politics and comedy when in fact they are two items on a Venn Diagram overlapping. Bottom-line though, Trump is just a comedy goldmine, so they would be doing themselves a huge disservice not to mine that ore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's fine, but it's worth recognizing that there is a massive space between "the lowest common denominator of discomfort" and being OK with changing in a room full of people. Plenty of perfectly normal, well-adjusted people fall into the space between those two. It's not the binary system you paint it as, where normal people who go outside and socialize are on one side changing together, while all the freaks who only live to get offended about things are on the other side. There are many reasons why someone might want a bit of privacy and it's really not an indicator of either of the situations you indicate above.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I generally respect Joe's willingness to talk to anyone about anything and I like his approach. It works really, really well for most people - athletes, scientists, and comedians especially. Where it becomes less smart an idea is when you bring political ideologues on without a countering view. The people Joe has on are just able to spout off with a very occasional uninformed check by Joe, who then turns it back into a conversation about something else and typically doesn't follow up. He does well with that sometimes - but the impact of giving a platform to someone so that they can spread bullshit is a lot more significant when the information can lead people to be misinformed about serious issues vs fun stuff like MMA or comedy. I don't particularly like the "just say what you want" approach if it's an ideologue guest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember casually suggesting that there be a "guys night" at the bouldering wall in my college gym since there was a "ladies night", where for an hour only women were allowed to climb. I was told that there is no reason guys need private space like that. I can see both sides - guys can be pretty douchey, getting extra "coachey" to the chicks, constantly hitting on them, etc when they just want to climb and do their own things sometimes, so a ladies night does seem generally more justified - but at the same time, the dynamic is definitely different when it's just guys around, and I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with letting that happen if the ladies get the wall to themselves for an hour a week. </TEXT>

More often he intentionally blurs the line and pretends to believe things he may or may not actually believe, but says them in a "sincere" enough way that people who actually do believe those things will walk away feeling like their ideas got an endorsement. You only have to look at who his fans are to see the truth in that. He has a far-right following for a reason, it's not an accident, and much of the time his satire is just a cloak. He is not a satirical character in the way that a comedian like Colbert was a satirical character, finding truth in the ridiculous.

<TEXT> Empathy involves the ability to recognize that just because I am not personally impacted by something doesn't mean I overlook it. It means that I can see what other people are going through - friends, relatives, and people I have never met - and sympathize with their struggle. So even if nothing impacted me, personally, I would still feel the way I do. I can relate to the people who are having a hard time making payments on the insurance they got through the ACA and feel that we need to pursue a solution to those problems, just as I can relate to the woman whose young child was detained at the airport due to Trump's travel ban, or to the Iraqis who helped American troops during the war but were stuck in airports trying to come to the US and in some cases sent back to Iraq, to a high likelihood of death. I do not need to be personally involved to recognize these things.

But as for me, personally:

 - Several people I know who rely on changes made to healthcare laws through the ACA have no clue what's coming down the road for them, and this uncertainty leaves them in a position where they have a difficult time planning for and proceeding with their lives, as major changes to the structure of our system will completely change their financial situations if enacted.
 - The budget proposal recently rolled out includes cutting funding for Americorps, a massively beneficial program that I am and many people I know participated it. It's an organization that does great work for communities all around the country in addition to granting experience for young people in many fields of work.
 - Environmental protections are an issue I am very passionate about as an advocate for publicly accessible outdoor space, and the future of such spaces is questionable given the new policies and staff appointed to manage them.
 - Several members of my family (extended, not nuclear) are no longer on speaking terms after the election, as any discussion devolves into gloating from the Trump supporting side and mockery of any objection to Trump's policies
 - I feel deeply uncomfortable with a first family openly bilking the government and the American people

That's "it", so far. </TEXT>

So is Milo old enough to have realized this yet? I feel like he's old enough to have realized it and can stop spreading the idea that he was the predator now, right?

It's sad that it happened to him, but take his statements as a whole - listen to both podcasts - he brings out every abuser's line in the book.

Their combined effect is beyond the pale - although they're pretty damning individually anyways. The problem is that he is providing the exact reason that abusers give for their crimes. He does this in every conversation he inserts himself into - takes the most confrontational and controversial view on the issue.

<TEXT> You have elucidated the central problem with Milo's whole persona, as I explained earlier. His fans just choose at their leisure what to believe and what not to believe, just as you are choosing to believe he was abused and that that explains his stupid, inexcusable views on pedophilia as a larger societal issue rather than just his own experience with it, while at the same time choosing not to believe that he knows the identities of pederasts (including the person who abused him - so is he making that up too, or choosing to withhold it? Can't have it both ways). You are deciding what is and isn't true in what he says to align with your own narrative. You are trying to take the high ground here, but you don't hold it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look, you are more interested in the reason he delivered a stupid and dangerous message so that he can be excused for it, while I am more concerned with the content of the message and why it's dangerous regardless of the reason he delivered it, because that's far and away more important. At this point it's clear you care more about his personal story and finding an excuse for him than the wider ramifications, and I care more about the damage sending messages like this does in the wider world. 

I urge you to read the post I linked, as it does a nice job of phrasing what I've been saying this entire time, and since I can't seem to get through to you, maybe someone else's words will. He is allowed to talk about his personal story as much as he wants. Spreading messages like the ones he's spreading, given the platform he has, is dangerous, stupid, and inexcusable.

And saying the police should investigate the pederasts Milo knows the identities of is obvious. That doesn't mean he shouldn't reveal them to the police to make their investigation easier, so it's no excuse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That makes zero difference. It is incumbent upon the adult, the responsible party in that situation, not upon the child, to not engage in an inappropriate and illegal sexual relationship. The idea that 13 and 14 year olds are the "predators" taking advantage of older men is a line that has been used by abusers to defend their actions for a long time now. Even if he *felt* like he was the "predator" in his situation, he was not. It is incumbent upon the adult to not allow these situations to take place. </TEXT>

However, there does need to be a line drawn and maintained on what is disallowed. Since food industry lobbying opened up what was allowed to be purchased, I fear that too many restrictions could be exploited by the food industry as well - i.e. certain conglomerates' (corn industry, etc) products given a pass while others are restricted.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you have a large platform and are speaking to a large audience, you carry more responsibility than the average person. Speaking in generalizations as he did is irresponsible and dangerous. He did not just say one stupid thing, he said several stupid things on at least two occasions. No matter where it stems from, even his own experience, it's still not OK to propagate those ideas like he did. As I said, those are arguments *used by abusers* and that's not a secret, it has been widely understood for years. If an idea is bad it is bad. When an idea is bad it should be treated as such, not given a free pass. 

The fact is this guy makes his living off of controversy so it could be that he is still processing trauma, or it could be that he knew these arguments were used by abusers and therefore it would be controversial for someone who experienced abuse to publicly espouse them - or, most likely, it's a mixture of the two. His entire career has been built of blending the line between what he actually thinks and what will get a rise out of people - it allows him to shrug off anything he doesn't want to associate himself with and then pick it back up later. This is a boy-cried-wolf situation - for years, he has taken up controversial positions intentionally, and thrived off of the blowback. He made his bed, so he gets to lie in it when people take him at his word.

<TEXT> No, we should support positive and productive messaging and absolutely cast out dangerous and unproductive attitudes *regardless* of who holds those opinions. If he wants to talk about his own experiences in a personal way, that is fine. That's completely understandable and justifiable. People experience the world differently. 

Going beyond that and justifying it in a larger sense is not OK and is not something he gets a free pass for. He is no longer speaking for himself, and as an adult he understands that his experience is not universal. Nonetheless he spreads dangerous ideas about pedophilia that are not new. These ideas have been around for awhile and are used by abusers to justify their activity. The idea that it's good for young boys to experience older men, that some 13 year olds are OK to molest because they're "mature", that the responsibility sometimes lies with the 14 year old and not the adult in the situation. He is an adult and should carefully consider the impact of his words.

Hiding the identities of known pederasts is, once again, also not at all OK. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As I said in my other reply to you, if he were speaking solely about his own experience that would be one thing. He goes far beyond it to make larger claims about the "benefits" that pedophilia offer to young boys, and makes several other statements and claims (such as personally knowing other pedophiles but refusing to act on that information) that are totally worthy of derision.

Just as being gay does not mean you have a free pass to say discriminatory, hateful stuff about gay people, neither does having been the victim of pedophilia mean you get a free pass to spread dangerous ideas about the "benefits" of molestation for other victims of it, or to protect pederasts that you know personally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If he were speaking solely about his own experience that would be one thing and would be entirely understandable. Where he steps over the line is in generalizing his experience and claiming that, in a larger sense, boys sleeping with older men is a good thing. He gives the exact justification for it that NAMBLA gives during his appearance on the Drunken Peasants podcast.

 In the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men  the sort of coming of age relationships  the relationships in which those older men help those young boys to discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable sort of rock, Yiannopoulos said.

This is no longer processing of his own experience, but justification of pedophilia in a larger sense.

That, and the claim that it's not really molestation if the 13 year old is sexually mature. He also claims to have been at several Hollywood parties where very young boys were sexually involved with older men during the JRE podcast, but has done nothing to report those people and refused to name them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So in the apology he posted, he says he is completely against pedophilia. 

 I am a gay man, and a child abuse victim, he wrote. My own experiences as a victim led me to believe I could say anything I wanted to on this subject, no matter how outrageous. But I understand that my usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humor might have come across as flippancy, a lack of care for other victims or, worse, advocacy.

Anyone watching the above video would clearly walk away thinking he is wholeheartedly defending pedophilia (even if only "in some cases" (like, 28/13)) AND saying that he was the predator (as a child) in the situation he was involved in. There is nothing jokey in the tone or content of his comments. Additionally, "deceptive editing" does not play a factor at all in the linked video, though Milo claims it did. Neither does it play a role in the comments he made on the Joe Rogan Experience - Rogan's podcasts are 3-hour long, uncut conversations with no editing whatsoever. The comments he made are not cut in any way. In both cases it's an extended conversation and the entire thing is right there, available for anyone to listen to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good point. One of the biggest sticking points with this Milo guy is that he is not arguing in good faith - that is, on any given point, he may or may not actually agree with what he's saying, and he makes little effort to clarify which views he actually supports, allowing people to run with or sideline as jokes the ideas he promotes at their leisure. But neither is what he says justifiable under the definition of satire, as his entire shtick is using his own, actual identity as a gay man with a black boyfriend as a prop to allow him to say offensive, derogatory, unproductive things. For those reasons he should not be taken seriously or viewed as a satirical character. He is just a troll. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Sweden is the "rape capital" of Europe mostly because they collect data differently than most countries.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden#Swedish_rape_statistics) For example, data is collected right when it is reported, not when it is verified to have occurred, so any incidents that are later overturned are still counted as rapes. And if a woman says she was raped by her husband every day for a year, Sweden counts that as 365 rapes while other countries typically count it as a single instance. The legal definition of rape is broader in Sweden than elsewhere, and there is not as much of a taboo around reporting as elsewhere. That is why there is such a disparity - not because it's vastly more common in Sweden. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well the headline was "DHS weighed Nat Guard for immigration roundups" and the up to 100,000 officials in 11 states number (which is in the article, not the headline though) comes from the number of National Guard members who would be eligible to participate in the 287(g) program, allowing state and local officials (and National Guard members if this memo were put into action) to act as immigration authorities. The memo directs the head of ICE to seek out and pursue all opportunities with state and local jurisdictions to enact the 287(g) measures. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to the first comment of yours that I replied to so we can get back on track and you can explain it, since you've just been dodging it instead:

 The women's march was against women having the freedom to vote for whoever they want.

This is the contention I've been asking you to support. The march was not arguing that women *can't* vote for whoever they want to. It had plenty of advice on who people *should* vote for, but to say it was *against the freedom to vote for whoever they want* is a completely disingenuous overstating of the facts.

AP: you should go ahead and [read the actual AP report](https://apnews.com/5508111d59554a33be8001bdac4ef830). It says:

 DHS spokeswoman Gillian Christensen declined to say who wrote the memo, how long it had been under consideration or when it had been rejected.

How was the author miscredited to make it seem worse when the author of the memo was never mentioned in the report?

 A DHS official described the document as a very early draft that was not seriously considered and never brought to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly for approval.

So as you said, it was a low-level memo. The AP report doesn't say otherwise. [Here is the memo itself - it has lots of numbers, but I don't know what numbers you're saying it doesn't have, please clarify.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3467508-Trump-National-Guard-Draft-Memo.html) Again, everything you say the report doesn't say, it does say. So labeling it fake news and false exaggeration is inaccurate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First paragraph - again, explain how turning away pro-life groups means they are saying people can't vote for whoever they want to...

Second - the results were within the margin of error for the aggregate polls. It was statistically unlikely that Trump would win but unlikely is not impossible, as we see every day when unlikely things happen. The AP report simply said that DHS considered the option of using the National Guard, which is true. There was an early draft memo on the option. This is the problem with calling all reporting, polling, and news that you don't like "fake news" - it is almost always the case that the report is actually accurate and that more was read into it than it actually says by people who want to freak out and claim there is a false news epidemic. Another example: when Trump called CNN fake news for reporting on the fact that he and Obama were briefed on the existence of the Steele dossier. That was something that actually happened - that was not fake news. They were briefed, and that's what CNN said happened. 

Third - now we're in anecdote country so I'm going to just let that go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First paragraph - still wondering where you're getting the idea that a movement representing women's rights means it's against women being able to vote for whoever they want to, as you claimed.

Second - really hard to parse what you're saying - all we've seen from Trump is consequences for lying? He hasn't faced nearly high enough a price for all the lying he and his administration do. Also wondering what you mean by the media lying its ass off to prevent his election - can you elaborate?

Third - Why would you presume I or anyone else thought it was a perfect system prior to this election? I have felt for years that ranked choice voting would lead to more representative outcomes and have wondered since Bush vs Gore whether or not the EC makes sense in the modern media world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have no doubt that it was his clumsy speech that created the issue. But that's why it's worth thinking about what the fuck you're going to say before you say it - perhaps even carefully planning a speech and making some digressions from it on points that you really want to emphasize. Fact is, he brought up "last night in Sweden" without specifying anything about it, and then listed cities like Brussels and Paris and Nice where terror attacks have happened. This really would be no big deal at all if he was just Donald Trump, rich guy making a speech. But he's the fucking president. The things he says matter very very much for that reason alone, and this style of speech where he just gets up and rants and raves is dangerous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Due to an insanely busy work schedule I decided to read a short book, or rather, collection of stories. It was **Clarkesworld: Issue 124** - a monthly publication featuring short sci-fi. It had six or seven stories and a few non-fiction articles. Although the stories were mostly interesting, I discovered that I'm not a huge fan of sci-fi short stories. One of the joys of sci-fi is getting to jump into a weird world that's different from our own due to technological advances, in much the same way that fantasy is cool because magic changes things. In short form, though, you barely get used to the rules before the story is over. The gears shift too quickly. I thought I might like it because I'm a big fan of short horror, but it was not to be. Still, it's really cool that these stories are available in print each month.

This week I will have the time to read **Authority** by Jeff Vandermeer. I started it last week and I'm not as gripped by it as I was by **Annihilation**, but that may change. The spooky, mysterious facility and the mystery of the former director is intriguing, but the family backstory is less so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the problem with Trump though. He says things in such a vague and undefined way that people can say "he meant X" when he might have meant Y or Z. People on both sides of the issue can do it because he is so fucking imprecise that it's basically a Rorschach test.  He doesn't specify "what happened in Sweden last night", and then goes on to list several cities where there were terror attacks. It is pretty easy to see why people would read that as him implying there was a terror attack. He most likely does this intentionally so that people can take whatever they want from it. If he were simply running a business that would be one thing - but the president sets agendas nationally and internationally and clarity is extremely fucking important in that arena.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm willing to bet there were plenty of people sitting around saying things like "our grandparents fought *real* X or Y" during the rise of past fascistic governments, and look where it got them. The great part about our system is that we get to voice our opposition to where our government is headed. We get to start heading it off at the pass instead of letting it flourish. Personally I feel that focusing on the incompetence of Trump's administration, and his betrayal of the working class that put him and the rest of the Republicans in office, is going to be a far more effective technique in unseating him.

I am pretty much on your side about the Milo shit, the protests get him more notoriety. He would not have been on Bill Maher without that bullshit. Saying the women's march is against women being able to vote for whoever they want is disingenuous and goofy though. And when people cite the popular vote victory it is typically to demonstrate that Trump doesn't have a mandate, or to suggest that we ought to consider reform in our system of voting, both fair points to raise.

We have seen explicit threats and table setting from Trump to silence free speech with the force of the government through a concerted campaign to discredit any journalistic outlets that dare to question him, and he is, after all, the president, so what he says has a hell of a lot more weight than some gutter punk antifa at Berkley. We are still in the very early days of his administration so those threats are incredibly worrying and need to be monitored.  </TEXT>

*BUT* unfortunately our president mainly interacts with other heads of state, and those are the people who will determine our fate as a nation. The lower we sink, the less interested people will be in working with us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello,

I have long thought that therapy would be very beneficial to me due to extremely high levels of stress, bouts of loneliness due to travel, and several other reasons. Since I travel so much it would not be feasible for me to keep solid appointments with a therapist in person. Does anyone have recommendations for services that are affordable and offer therapy by phone? Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This popped to mind while I was showering today - is there any interest in a weekly podcast discussion of that week's book? I have only recorded some (very) low-key podcasts mainly for my own entertainment in the past, but I think it could be fun. I'm envisioning a discussion of the book where people can connect and chime in if they'd like, a section where we highlight some reviews of the book (professional reviews or funny ones from amazon), bring up some of the points mentioned by users in the discussion thread, maybe some information on the author... any interest and / or thoughts on other sections that could be good in podcast form? I would very much to host and/or help get something like this off the ground! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Incessant Fundraising - Strongly considering Cancelling my subscription </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-04 15:00:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Is anyone else feeling this way? It permeates every conversation that TYT has these days. I get that they're trying to make a ton of money for their investigative reporting teams, but there's a reason NPR only does periodic fundraising drives and then just has occasional mentions about donations in bumpers between shows. That reason is that it drives the listeners insane to *constantly* hear about donations and fundraising. It seems like that's all TYT has really focused on over the past few weeks, and considering they still want to raise $1.4 million more, it doesn't seem like it will be ending anytime soon. This makes me want to cancel my membership for at least a few months until this ends. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 52 books: my highlights and lowlights </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-06 05:23:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First of all, thanks to this sub for keeping me on-track - I lurked throughout the year and picked up some great recommendations. Instead of a full list, I will just give five highlights and five lowlights. Well get the bad out of the way first - these arent necessarily the worst books I read this year, as I rated most of them 2 stars, and read several one star books - but they were the most disappointing compared to my expectations. I promise you I am not trying to be edgy by hating on popular books - I read several popular books that I enjoyed quite a bit this year. Anyways, on with the lists!

**LOWLIGHTS:** 

**Ready Player One** ** by Ernest Cline - I loved the first 50 pages of this book - it hooked me hard. But I quickly grew tired of the endless lists of references - they started to seem less like an interesting stylistic choice and more like a total bore. I could hardly handle the parts that just describe our hero playing a video game or reenacting a movie - that was about as uncompelling a storytelling device as I can possibly imagine. It had its moments, and a very strong opening, but on the whole I was very let down.


**Dark Matter** ** by Blake Crouch - Another highly-compelling sci-fi concept that wasnt explored in enough depth. The central narrative severely limited the scope of this story, which could have been boundless and infinitely (literally) interesting, but instead felt very confined by the characters choices. It also explained several fairly well-known scientific concepts (Schrodingers Cat, the Multi-Worlds Theory) in the way that Crichton does - but the concepts werent out there enough to work the way that Crichtons books tend to. It felt elementary. Its also called Dark Matter, and they explain what Dark Matter is in the book, but Dark Matter has seemingly nothing whatsoever to do with the book. 


**Good Omens** ** by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman - It felt rambling and tangential, and more than any other co-authored book that Ive read, it felt like two people wrote it. Maybe it just isnt my type of humor, but I just didnt enjoy it all that much.


**Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas** ** by Hunter S Thompson - It seems to me like this is a book I would have absolutely loved while I was in college. Part of the point was that these guys (sort of) realize that theyre assholes at the end of the book, but it didnt make reading about them being assholes for a couple of hundred pages any more enjoyable. I do think back fondly on the mushroom trips Ive taken and on (some of) my drunken escapades with friends - but we were nowhere near as shitty as these two are, so its tough to get on board with them. Some of the writing was quite good though.


**The Man in the High Castle** ** by Phillip K Dick - To be honest I just found it dreadfully boring.

**HIGHLIGHTS:**


**Infinite Jest** by David Foster Wallace ***** - This one was very much about the journey, a 3-month one for me. I can see why this book has a reputation, but in all honesty, it was a much more enjoyable book than I would ever have expected simply by virtue of the fact that it is often absolutely hilarious and frequently prescient and insightful. It is also extremely confusing and seemingly tangential for about the first 200 pages - the pieces dont start to click together for days and days worth of reading. But once they do click its a pretty amazing feeling, and the pieces fit together better and better as you begin to understand what youre reading and get further into the book. The sections about addiction and alcoholism were especially meaningful to me, as I had recently quit drinking and was struggling with that myself. I will absolutely reread this someday.


**Lolita** by Vladimir Nabokov ***** - Some truly excellent writing. I found it to be a very alarming experience to get seduced by Humberts eloquence and comedy, drifting into sympathizing with him as I read, then only later remembering oh shit, hes a rapist and pedophile. The writing was absolutely top-notch. As disturbing as the implications of the book are, and as creepy as I felt reading it in public (which I did only once, for that very reason), it was a hilarious, tragic, and discomfiting ride.


**Mans Search for Meaning** by Viktor E Frankl ***** - Incredibly powerful first-hand account of what it took to survive a concentration camp. Makes you take a seat and think wow, my life *really* isnt all that bad after all. Ever since my decade-long crying drought ended during the first 5 minutes of Up, I have been more and more sentimental as time goes on, and I will admit that I shed a few tears during this book at some of what I was reading. It is seriously fucked, what people went through, and a lot of survival just came down to random chance. The second half of the book details the mindset Frankl used to mentally cope with what he was going through, and its very applicable to everyday life. Essentially, having a purpose, a reason for being, is what keeps people going. Without purpose, direction and motivation evaporates and people faded to dust in the camps - but with a purpose in mind, its far easier to deal with what life throws at you.


**The People in the Trees** by Hanya Yanagihara **** - The first half of this book was such a different experience from the second half. You are treated to an anthropological exploration of an incredible, strange culture, and theres a mystery afoot. Then, all of a sudden shit starts to get weird. And from there on out it gets weirder and more depressing and disturbing until the end, which is completely devastating. 


**The Beach** by Alex Garland **** - An incredible character portrait - a book where I wasnt fully sure what was going on until 250 pages in, when things started to click and I realized this character I was reading about - all the weird things he had done that I had excused because I was seeing them from his point of view - was something different than what I had been thinking of him as. I was also a big fan of *Ex Machina*, which Garland directed, and *Enslaved: Odyssey to the West*, a game which he wrote. Hes directing a film adaptation of *Annihilation*, another book that I greatly enjoyed this year, so Im excited for that to come out in 2017.


Fittingly, I am finishing out the year by reading **The Sixth Extinction** by Elizabeth Kolbert. This year seemed set on periodically shooting a fire extinguisher at my sense of what is right and just in this world, so why not read about mass annihilation to close it out!

Edit: Just in case anyone is curious, I do have a standardized way of rating books - it's entirely based on my own opinion/evaluation of course, but it helps ensure that my ratings are based on the same criteria and not just an impulse:

Is it a book? +1

 - By virtue of being a book it gets a point.

Is it interesting? Up to +1

This can mean entertaining, informative, intriguing - basically, how much did it capture my interest? Score can be 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1 - the higher the better.

Quality Writing? Up to +1

How strong was the writing - was it consistent across the book or were there weaker sections? Did the plotting make sense? Did the writer seem to achieve whatever their goal seemed to be with the book? Was there anything particularly memorable about the writing style? Etc.

Message? Up to +1

Did the book leave me with something to think about? This is important to me, but might not be to others.

Extra: -1 to +1

This is to build in wiggle room if something was especially great or especially terrible, or if something truly stood out about the book (in a good way or a bad way). In order to get a 5 a book has to be especially great in some way to get the extra +1.

So I just have a spreadsheet with each of those slots on it, and I type my numbers in, then round up or down depending on what the number is to get my star rating for the book. Pretty simple! </TEXT>
