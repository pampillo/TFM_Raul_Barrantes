<TEXT> Yeah, like I was beyond disappointed. I almost felt like I had wasted my time. She went through so much just for that. I  was glad Kelsea got her face back tho. It had bothered me a little that she looked like Lily and not herself but tbh I just pictured her as Emma Watson regardless of how she was described.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. Before reading the book I had heard that there was a twist at the end and it was so hard for me not to look. What did you think of the other books in the series? Also, what about the ending did you not like? The ending made me feel hopeless kind of. You?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> (This is my first time posting any then on Reddit and my first time reviewing something) 
I first started this series a couple of years ago. I LOVED the first book and found it really refreshing to have a cool female protagonist.( I remember telling people that and them saying that since I was a guy that was odd but whatever). Anyway I loved the second and was happy to have finally found out how that how crossing over thing worked and how they discovered an entirely new land. 
Now, overall I liked the third book but there were some things I didn't care for. Like the tearing down of the fetch's character. Like, it was almost impressive how how much I was forced to dislike him because in the end Kelsea did. Also I  like the narative of the gatekeeper who was looking for his wife ( I literally have forgotten his name. I finished this book a while ago) but at the Same time his narrative was a bit unnecessary. Had it not been in the book nothing would have really changed.   
I've always loved the Red Queen's character but it felt so weird seeing her work with Kelsea. And how easily Kelsea began to sympathize with her. I understood that she had been inside her mind but it still felt forced. 

Now onto the ending: I feel like the ending makes sense and happens to be what's  best for the characters but it just broke me heart anyway! It felt odd after after reading two plus books and page after page of Kelsea defending her kingdom for it to not exist. It makes sense I know but it hurt. It also felt too fast paced and ended a bit abruptly. On one hand I like that but at the same time I don't. It also left me with many questions. Overall a good read and a series that deserves more attention.  Sorry for rambling. 

Anyway what did you think of the ending and the entire series? What did you like and what would you change?  </TEXT>
