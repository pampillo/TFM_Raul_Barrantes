<TEXT> Oh my god. No. And no. 

12 is extremely standard and probably more on the smaller side for live 1/2. Leading river is fine, it's a disaster if river gets checked through which he does w a large range of his value hands after being called on flop and turn.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well worth it.  The tasting system is pretty sweet.  They give you a small tasting glass along with 4 orange poker chips.  You then can trade in your chip for a pour of whatever they happen to have that day - they had 6 brews when I was there.  Each pour was very generous and you're basically on an honor system to go pay at the register.  Its $5 and you keep the glass, so that was cheap.  Crowler/growler fills were a little pricey but that's okay.  </TEXT>

Been shipping USPS ever since and have never had a problem with medium/large flat rate boxes.  I put each can in a plastic bag, individually wrap w bubble wrap, add padding to the walls of the box, and usually throw in some loose rice as a noise maker.  If anyone asks whats in the box, "care package for a friend who just came back from a year long volunteer abroad trip"

<TEXT> Depends on your fermentation. For my NEIPAs, normally takes me 7 days to reach my final gravity so I can dry hop literally during high krausen and then a few days before racking. 

It won't do much harm if you leave your beer in primary for longer so that you're not dry hopping before final gravity is reached. In short, should be fine! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know how many lbs of fermentables you're using, so I tried to "reverse engineer" your recipe.

I have 12 lb total, 8.5 MO, 1.4 white wheat, 0.7 C80, 0.47 choc, 0.47 dark choc, 0.47 carapils. 

 That should theoretically yield:

1.061 OG

1.015 FG

5.97% ABV

SRM 30.82

Personally I brew 2.5g batches and have used 0.5lb choc and 0.5lb of roasted barley.

I would say maybe replace some of the carapils with some roasted barley?  Just FYI, im no expert. </TEXT>

<TEXT> yea $150 or so at least imo. K7ss has a lot of equity but probably not the best hand if the board bricks out.  We have no problem taking it down here but if we get it in that's not bad either.  Bad would be if QQ guy flats and turn is a 10h or some shit.

<TEXT> You can't play every hand "being scared of a set."

That's a sign that poker is not for you. His sizing on the flop is small imo but it's perfectly fine to raise w a pair and second nfd. You fold out some hands better than yours and if you get called you still have good equity.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Um there's no 4-bet to 82... there's a bet, a call, and a raise (2-bet) to 82. 

QQ open should be to at least $18 imo. 

The squeeze to $192 is flat out terrible. K7 guy is never folding there given size of the pot and J9 is almost NEVER good in that spot. In fact, he got it in against the very bottom of the guys range and still is an underdog to scoop the pot. He literally beats nothing but pure air.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is probably about my 5th batch, BIAB - Details below.

Target OG: 1.074

Target FG: 1.018

ABV: 7.32%

IBU: 102.06

SRM: 4.61

Fermentables:

2# Flaked oats

3.54 # of pale 2-row (.04 was just from a heavy hand)

1.5# of carapils

0.5# of corn sugar (used to boost ABV as I was limited on kettle size for my mash.  I really didn't want to do this, but oh well?)

Mashed at 153F for 45 mins

Boil Size was about 3.25g

0.75oz of mosaic at 60

Whirlpool of 0.25oz mosaic and 1oz citra for 20 mins

5 day dry hop of: 1oz Amarillo, 1oz citra

3 day dry hop of: 1oz mosaic, 1 oz Amarillo

OG reading came to about 1.072, so I'm fairly happy with that.  The color during the mash was awesome, after the boil it looked more grey than anything which was a little disheartening but RDWHAHB right...?

Its fermenting healthily with 1056 right now at about 65F in my basement. 

Batch size somewhere in the 2.5g region




EDIT: Also, I have not messed with creating water profiles yet.  I am literally using bottled water from the grocery.

1.055 OG 

1.013 FG

1056 ale yeast pitched 4 days ago 

5lb golden promise 

0.25 lb crystal 10

Fermentation temp 63F wrapped in a blanket 

Krausen appeared and was active but never more than an inch thick or so, much less and shorter than my IPA batches. 

Should I just take a gravity reading to see where we're at?

I can provide a pic but basically looks like solid yeast cake on bottom of carboy and almost clear top of the wort, like it's done fermenting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Currently have 2 batches - a coffee stout at around 1.012 SG and 5% ABV ready to bottle and an IPA that will finish around 1.025 and 7.25% ABV.  

Both are about 3 gallons or so.  I have 23 swing top 16oz bottles that I plan to use for the IPA.  My question is, can I carb the stout in my 64oz growlers from breweries I have visited?  It'll be low carb (2 volumes or so) so I don't think ill be making bombs?

I'd prefer not to hunt down empty bottles and cap and I don't have CO2/reg for the keg I just bought.  </TEXT>

2 lb oats steeped at 160F for 20 mins in 3.75 gal water. Removed oats, bring water to boil. Stir in 6.6 lb of "Extra Light" LME and added 1 oz Citra for bittering. 60 min boil to about 3.25 gall final wort volume. 

At this point, it's already dark as hell. Has nothing really to do w burning at the bottom. So idk... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've tried 2x now to get a NEIPA out of a LME brew. Both times, the color is so dark and malty. The first batch was made w Pilsen light and turned out dark. The second batch I used extra light LME, steeped some flaked oats, then proceeded as normal. Still, suuuper dark...  

how the hell do I get the lighter end of the SRM spectrum? The brew tastes pretty great and has a super tropical nose but the color is off putting to me as I'm local to Tree House, NEBCO, Trillium, etc lol  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok got it. Well, my thought would be to add a kidney loop that extends lower beyond the bottom of your current setup. Assuming the coil is in a cylindrical shape, can you make a smaller diameter coil that sits within (and taller) the original? If you can fit a cylinder within a cylinder then you can achieve the longer height and effectively add more cooling surface area. Something like this:

<TEXT> First time stout brewer, looking for comments/advice. 

60 min boil, 3 gallon boil volume, 2.75 or so gallon batch?

Going to steep 0.5 lb flaked oat, 0.5 lb roasted barley, 0.5 lb American chocolate 

4.5 lb Dark LME

0.5 oz summit at 60 mins

0.25 oz fuggles at 30 mins

0.25 oz fuggles at 0 mins


Safale American Ale Yeast US-05

OG: 1.062

FG: 1.012

6.55% ABV

66 IBU and 40 SRM


I ferment in my basement at a steady 62 F and usually just use Poland Spring drinking water. I haven't messed around w my own water chemistry yet. I will probably add coffee to this. 

Is there a way I can get a higher FG for a thicker mouthfeel?

<TEXT> Creating a coffee stout extract recipe on brewers friend and had a couple questions. Brewers friend has the option to add a custom fermentable (fruit, coffee, etc) but it's asking for PPG and Lovibond values for the additive. Without going into too much detail any idea how I can calculate that if I plan to add either dry beans or cold brew?

Also, if I want a higher final gravity what's the best way to achieve that? I'm looking at an OG of 1.061 and final of 1.012. I'd prefer a little more body  </TEXT>

You also say he opens to 15+. I'm not sure what your live experience is like but that is not uncommon at all. Live games are much different than the standard 3x of online that was once common.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm almost ready to rack my NEIPA (LME recipe). We brewed on 1/21 and fermentation has visibly come to almost a stand still. Should I take gravity readings straight from the carboy w a siphon or can I transfer everything to my secondary/bottling bucket (with a spigot for ease of pouring) so that taking samples/hydro readings is easier?  My bottling bucket has a lid w a hole for an airlock, so if the gravity hasn't stabilized I can leave it in there I assume. 

Main concerns are oxidation.  

Also, once I have everything in secondary, I was planning to use a priming sugar calculator, dilute w a touch of water then mix it in w the beer before bottling.  Is that standard practice? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My basic recipe- 2.5 gallon batch 60 min boil
Steeped 1/2 lb of flaked oak in 155 F water for 30 mins and removed bag. 

Added 2 gallon of water to the steep and brought to a boil. 

Removed heat and added my liquid yeast extract (about 5.05 lb of CBW Pilsen Light)

Add initial bittering hops 10 mins into boil (citra - 0.5 oz I thinkkk) 

Add hops w 10 mins remaining (.75 oz azacca, .75 oz mosaic, .5 oz Citra)

Chill to 180F

Add .75 azacca .75 mosaic .5 Citra 

Sit for 30 mins, remove hops, and chill to 80F. Add yeast (M36 Liberty Bell Ale dry yeast - 74 to 78% attenuation) 

Transfer to fermenter and top off to 2.75 gallons 

45 hours in I added a dry hop of 1.5 oz Citra, 1.5 oz azacca, 1.5 oz mosaic

I added the dry hop slightly after high krausen occurred. 

Now here's the tricky part... I didn't taking a starting gravity. I know I can just wait for the fermentation to be stable after 3 days, but how do I know what final gravity I should be aiming for? 

The color looks a tad dark but I think once all the trub settles it'll lighten up and probably still keep the hazy look.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Opinions on swing top bottles?

I am fermenting my first NEIPA batch and don't want to start off kegging.  I figure bottling would also be a pain in the ass so my brew partner and I were considering filling 16oz swing tops and maybe a few 750ML growlers to give as gifts.

Any special equipment I would need for this or just priming sugar and cap? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks so much. I will double check on the strain when I get home and update.  

I had a 3 gallon batch that I have fermenting in a 5-6 gallon carboy at the moment.  I have an 8 gallon or a 5 gallon bucket that I could dry hop in.  I imagine I wouldn't want to drop the hop (in hop sack) in the carboy as it'd be a bitch to get out? Then just siphon the liquid into the new bucket without the sediment?  Or am I way off... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Check your local distributors.  I know the A10V used to have an unreal lead time from the factory (literally over 50 weeks), but there should be a Rexroth distributor in the area.

Alternatively, you should be able to directly cross it over to a Parker P1 pump.  Parker distributors have a program that can get certain arrangements in less than a couple days if they don't already have them on the shelf.  If you need help finding a Parker Store or Truck Hydraulics Center, let me know.  I don't work for them (anymore) but have several contacts in the company still.

<TEXT> Because opening to 12-15k essentially accomplishes the same thing when stacks are so shallow. Raising ~30% of our stack and having to fold is literally the worst option. It's also much better to raise all in than to call all in, as you are being the aggressor and will more often than not take it down pre.

As you said, c/r that flop w a made boat seems like value suicide. Just lead larger on the turn and this should play the rest of the hand out.

<TEXT> I agree that his range is super wide.  I disagree that vs a described villain a 4b w JT is good.  This guy sounds like a typical passive live fish who is stuck and wants to see flops w tons of holdings.  I think he flats way more than he shoves or folds and that puts us in really weird flop spots if we whiff and he can play the hand in position.  I don't see the need to go nuts against this guy who is going to pay off your value hands when you make them anyway.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think if bb pops to 30 we just fold without much thought to it.  Torching $4 by limp folding is fine by me in this spot most of the time. Tossing away 2 bb is sorta trivial to me when were playing in a game that is being played way bigger post flop anyway.  I think BB and UTG are more than happy to see a flop multiway for cheap (yet still inflated pot due to straddle). 

Open mucking here just seems so nitty... If this is your rule of thumb then what range of hands do you complete here with?  Are you really only ever raising or folding?  
Appreciate the comments, I'm not trying to come off confrontational either - this conversation is a healthy one and I look forward to hearing different thought processes.  That's why I posted in the first place, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just visit this page:
http://treehousebrew.com/on-tap/

They update it regularly.  When the beer is done canning they will update the page with limits, price, and a description of that brew.  

Wednesdays are cans only and hours are 12-6 although they have been opening early to allow for better traffic regulation and parking.

Thursday and Friday are cans and growlers and open is 5-8 (early, same as above).  

Saturday is open for fills, whatever cans are left over, and sometimes a rare release of a Native (sour) or sometimes a pour permit where they offer on site pours.  

Your best bet is to just follow them on twitter or update the On Tap page. 

Cans range from $3.25 to $5 per can depending on release.  Limits also vary based on rareness, case yield, etc. but is usually 3-10 cans (most usually 4-6) 

Edit: If you have any other questions just reply or PM me.  I go every week and am about 45 mins out as well from the Hartford area.  </TEXT>

Also was blown away by BA Vanilla Shake from Mikkeller and the Wide Awake Its Morning from Funky Buddha (tastes like a freaking McGriddle and coffee breakfast)

For a brewery? Really pleasantly surprised with the stuff SingleCut in Astoria NY has been releasing.  They had a bourbon maple stout that was excellent and the 18 Watt session was insanely juicy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> live 1/2, hero sitting on about 300.  I am a 29 year old white male, used to play in this room all the time when I lived in this city and some of the regs recognize me and are making friendly banter.  I think people see me as very competent but maybe a tad on the LAG side. 


Have history w villain 1 in BB.  He is a drunk in his mid 40s, usually also on pain meds or some other pharmaceutical. He has about 240 to start the hand.


Villain 2 in hijack is an unknown black male around age 40.  Seems fairly decent but limps too much and I recently saw him stack off on a 258r flop and muck to shown AA when he was 3b shoved on. He has about $180 to start the hand.


Hero sits in sb, there is a $4 straddle utg. 3-4 limps around and hero completes w KcJs.  I don't see any point in squeezing here as we get called in multiple spots imo.


Flop runs Jc8c2c.  Hero leads for $15 into $24 or so. Villain 1 and villain 2 flat, others fold.  Turn Jd.  I have a feeling im up against at least 1 fd so betting turn seems ideal.  I also have a fairly premium J as AJ I would expect a raise pre. 


Hero leads turn for $30.  Villain 1 min raises to $60, and villain 2 fairly quickly shoves.  


Hero???

I think its possible were up against at least one made flush.  V2 shows up w clubs here sometimes but I have a feeling that V1 probably has some Jx. 


So... Flat?  Shove? Fold?
Will post results after some discussion.

Interestingly, I saw same villain 3b pre to like 45 and open jam for 200 on a 852r flop. He was called and villains AA held up. Idk why the huge overbet w that type of hand but it really made me think about the JJ hand over and over again. So weird.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hero has been sitting for maybe 5 hands and has $300 effective, villain covers. 

Villain is a reg, haven't played w him before but I recognize him. Has missing teeth, gnarly meth head looking guy but clearly capable of making plays and seems like a thinking player (ironic I know). 

Hero picks up JsJc in MP and raises to 12. MP+1 and cutoff call and villain on button makes it 41 to go. Hero flats and others fold. 

Flop Qs10h6c. Hero checks and villain checks back. 

Turn 2d and hero checks and villain bombs for $103... hero???

Sizing on the turn seems really very strange to me. I feel like most of his value hands should be betting like $50-75 and not a full PSB. Perhaps this is AK? Perhaps this is a weirdly played set? Really hard to say. 

We check the turn to allow villain to continue with bluffs and for pot control. I think if we lead turn and get raised it's a pretty gross spot. 

After a few replies I'll post some showdowns that I saw villain in that occurred after this hand.  </TEXT>

OP is really lucky that he was 4b and that makes this a super easy shove, but getting all the money in pre in PLO is always kinda LOL to me. This isn't NLHE, PLO is a post flop game. This hand plays super tough OOP if we get callers behind, we only really like flops w top set or nut spade draws.  </TEXT>

1 dollar for almost all pots. 2 for pots in the like 200-500 range. 1k+ I usually throw like $10-15, $25 if I like the dealer and we're friends. 

Best times to play generally are weekend nights. Try 9-10pm and later on a Saturday night to get some drunks and random tourists.  If I cash an odd amount like $234 I'll tip a buck to the dealer when I leave, buck to the cashier, and keep singles for valet or drink tips.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok from what I have found on a 753 those are running a gear pump for auxiliary functions and a hydrostat for the propulsion.  So to answer your question - by increasing the speed of the engine you are increasing the output of the pump which is most likely increasing the speed of the motors.

EDIT:  The only benefit to this (completely a guess) is that you have enough HP to burn if you wanted to go full throttle on the propulsion and dead head one of the aux functions (ex. raise a cylinder at full speed) at the same time.  Its possible that performing both of these at the same time is putting the hydraulic system in an overdemand situation and it will stall or bog down the engine.  Again, without reading the article, maybe that's why they are doing it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends: Are you running a fixed displacement pump (gear pump or vane pump or fixed bent axis piston)?  Are you running a variable displacement piston pump?

Your flow is a function of displacement and of speed.  So if you keep the displacement the same, and increase the speed, naturally your pump flow will increase.  However, some more complex systems with variable displacement piston pumps allow you to change the displacement of the pump as its running to achieve a desired amount of flow, regardless of the input speed.  For example, say you want a pump to run at a fixed 30 GPM but your input RPM fluctuates between 1000 RPM and 3000 RPM;  we can reduce the displacement at 3000 RPM to achieve the same output flow.  Hope that makes sense.

<TEXT> Hopefully I am understanding your post correctly...I assume you mean they are replacing the skid steers motor to drive the same stock hydraulic pump and motor?

If that is the case, the larger HP motor will obviously produce more power and can handle more torque.  The limiting factor on this would be your hydraulic motor.  Is it going to run at the same pressure and speed?

Assuming you use the same displacement pump and run at the same pressure, nothing will change.  If you run a higher displacement pump (or increase the RPM on the pump) the flow rate will increase (and most likely increase your motor RPM). 

Its really hard to say what youre talking about without a better description of the application.  
Sorry for the confusing response lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pre is absolutely a fold.  Multiway this flop is a slam dunk call for me.  Raising puts you in strange spots on a lot of turns.  What happens if a heart falls on the turn? A lot of the time this Qh is not the best flush out there.

This whole hand seems fairly standard after your preflop mistake. As mentioned, 6,7,9 do not make your hand the nuts.  This is an easy way to torch a couple buyins - chasing non nut draws.  Fold pre and avoid it all.  Also pretty hilarious that bb minraises w top set on the turn lmao... Lighting money on fire... </TEXT>

Raise gives villain opportunity to stop and go and make us fold lots of flops. Raise call is meh. Raise fold is horrible. Flat is bad for obvious reasons. Fold leaves us in the BB with 6BB remaining and villain is shoving button w almost entire range.

<TEXT> Can you explain your setup a bit more?  Former hydraulic systems engineer here and would love to help.

So are you pedaling the bike to turn the pump, then the pump generates flow to turn the motor to the wheels?

The larger the motor you use, the slower it will turn.  You can calculate all the theoreticals of this.  You know the size of your pump and the speed at which it will spin, so you can calculate Q or your flow rate.  Take your flow rate and your motor displacement to calculate the RPM output of the motor.  You can also calculate the torque produced T = CIR * PSI / 75.36 to yield torque in ft*lbs.  

Hope that helps and wasn't talking down to you at all - I'm not sure how hydraulically inclined you are! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like checking back the turn better. If he's calling a flop bet on such a dry board he likely has Kx or sets. I don't think the bet on the turn accomplishes much other than exposing ourselves to c/r and bloating the pot when we know we probably aren't folding the NFD. Pretty sure villains hand is always 2p+ here and river fold is fine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> H1: very easy fold as described villain never shows up with less.  TP w decent kicker is never good and we don't have a fd or sd to add any equity

H2: flatting $27 is perfectly fine, and honestly probably optimal. 3b is bad as described villain is rarely opening worse. AP, its almost ALWAYS QQ+ but I think more heavily weighted to KK or AA. I don't see OMC just ripping it in w AK or JJ/TT/QQ.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate to sound harsh, but maybe they should do a better job of marketing themselves?  Some places obv gain popularity vi word of mouth and develop a cult following (ie. Tree House, Alchemist, etc) but you have to put some of that burden on the brewers themselves.  If people don't know about it, they aren't going to seek it out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wall of text, but worth the read IMO.  It felt good to write this all down and I'm kinda laughing about it now.

During college I came home for Thanksgiving (class of 2010 for reference).  The night before Thanksgiving everyone generally goes out and gets wasted at the bars.  This particular night, I went out to Hibachi style dinner with some friends for a girls birthday, we have drinks, dinner, etc then head to a bar downtown.  They have 22oz drafts of anything on tap for $1, so I proceed to have quite a few.  Finally, I feel that rumble... I go to stand in line for the bathroom, there are 3 urinals, and 2 toilets behind these weird western saloon style swing doors facing each other.  It gets to be my turn and I know this is going to be ugly but it has to be done, so I say "sorry guys but im going to shit my pants if I don't take a shit now... enter at your own risk."  I proceed to have the most explosive mud bomb explosion in which I must have been airborne for a slight period of time.  People start clapping and jeering as I walk out of the bathroom.  That is part one....


A few mins later, this girl starts chatting me up.  She's petit, pretty cute, and I've somewhat seen her around as she was from my town but we ran in different circles.  We're hanging out and some dude walks by and says "yooo youre the dude who took a shit in the bathroom!" and offers me a high five.  I sort of chuckle it off and she is visibly disgusted and walks away.  Fine, whatever.  I few hours later I end up at an afterparty.  She is there, we are really drunk by now and she says "well are you going to bring me home or what?"  So, we walk about 3/4 of a mile to my house.  My dad is basically an insomniac, I can see him in the living room on the computer. We sneak in, and I lead her to the basement stairs (where I normally sleep).  My dad asks how my night was from the other room and I just say "great, going to bed see you tomorrow."  We screw each others brains out that night, it was pretty unreal.  I wake up in the morning to the sounds of my parents walking around upstairs, clueless that I have a completely naked girl in my bed in the basement.  Then, I hear my father open the door to the basement and start to make his way down.  I cover up the chick as best I can and pretend to be asleep.  He says "hey time to get up, we have to go to the football game" and I say ok and I would be up in a minute.  Now the panic sets in as I have no way to get this girl out of the house.  Her mom calls her and asks where the hell she is, she says she stayed with a friend and would be home after work.  After hanging up she looks at me and says "so can you give me a ride to work?"  Well, no, no I cant - I have no car here and I have to go to a game with my dad. Mind you, her work is about 40 minutes away from where I live.  Finally, it dawns on me that when I was in highschool I would sneak through the crawlspace window and out the neighbors yard at night.  I look over to the girl, tell her the game plan, and was briskly greeted with "Youre fucking kidding right?" I say nope, and boost her up to the window to make her escape.  I tell her if she walks a couple blocks south there is a pretty main strip of road where she can likely find a cab.

The football game was pretty fun.

**TL;DR:** took a mean dump at a bar and was berated for it, took a chick home to my parents house and made her crawl out the basement window and figure out how to get to work 40 mins away.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The line moves incredibly fast, way more efficient than any other big release brewery imo.  A 2.5 hour line at Trillium Fort Point would be like 45 mins tops at Tree House.  They really have their shit together and its overall just a really well managed establishment.  I really don't have a single bad thing to say other than sometimes the field smells like shit from the septic system lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> As other users have stated, the amount of force exherted (or absorbed) over a period of driving time is significantly higher with braking than it is with shock absorbtion.  These systems also weigh a lot.  Some manufacturers for hydraulic regen braking systems make the giant accumulators out of wrapped carbon fiber to save on weight - but its a double edged sword as that accumulator is then extremely expensive.

<TEXT> 2008 to 2010 or so I was staked mostly for $26 freezeouts on FTP, obviously I played a ton of miniFTOPS and some of the actual FTOPS events.  We did pretty well, I shipped the 35k for like 9k once and a couple other 4 figure scores.  I was in college so my volume wasn't insane but I had a pretty damn good ROI with a medium'ish volume.  One day, my backer just fell off the face of the earth - to this day I have no idea what happened but I think he prob just went busto.  Occasionally I would catch him playing PLO up to 25/50 and just getting hosed.  </TEXT>

I would just say be safe leaving the home game.  Make sure no one follows you out, make sure you have safe travel back to your final destination.  I was robbed once leaving a club game and it was not such a great memory.  </TEXT>

Another girl said "Nope" freely and moved on.  Kids started to poke fun that I was blushing and I remember saying "I wish I was black so you couldn't see me blush."  The girl who said "Nope" was African American.  I literally had no idea what I did was wrong at the time.  I was called to the principals office and was like wtf is going on I didn't even do anything bad!??  To this day I still feel like an asshole when I think about it. :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> Would disagree on H1 and I think betting flop is fine.  Villain who limps the CO rarely has aces in his range as he should be raising them in late pos. You get called by a lot on this board, weak Qx hands, flush draws, etc.  There's a very good chance that youre winning the hand and we have redraws to improve so building a little bit of a pot is fine.


H2: seems like a trivial fold as mentioned. Everything gets there and we're holding middle and bottom 2.  Soooo many hands that crush us completely.  Just fold and find another spot.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would agree. The playability if this hand OOP is pretty shitty even thought think he can do this pretty light because of how strong it looks. It could honestly just be to ISO you in position vs the other limpets who are almost ALWAYS folding... The question tho, is if you ship what is his calling range? Do we think he's folding big hands? I think a jam looks incredibly strong on our part but who knows.   </TEXT>

That is literally awful advice. We are WAY too short to be c/r flops.

The only play here is to shove pre or fold.  Shove  Fold  Flat.  Flatting is so horribly exploitable and allows villain to barrel almost every flop. If our hand does not flop well, we basically are giving away chips even though we can be ahead of a lot of his range.   </TEXT>

Going to try to keep this as my inventory list.  Will be open to trades - would prefer IP but would ship if you have a solid rep and the price point/ratios are fair.  Thanks!

<TEXT> Played a super frustrating 1/2 PLO hand last night live.  Was sitting on around 450 or so, villain in hand is BB and has about 400.  


Had 10c8c9s6s and raised to $10 UTG+1 after a limp.  2 calls, and villain raises to $40.  BB UTG calls, I call, button calls.


Flop 9c7s4c and BB fires $50.  Things get fucked up here - I did not see that UTG had cards and I announce $240 before he acts.... He ends up folding, my $240 goes in, BB is all in for like $50 (whatever) and BB tanks and says I gotta be ahead and ships the rest in and I call.  Villain shows AhAd9d2d.... huh?


Board runs out 3x3x and he scoops.  He racks up 1 hands later and says I knew I was ahead. 
EDIT: Just ran equities, 81% in this hand ughhhhhhhh </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hand 1: You are short at this table, with less than 50 BB this hand plays much differently.  Check back the turn and plan to call most rivers.


Hand 2: 4x is NOT huge in a live NL game.  5-10x is commonly used - depends on the table dynamics.  AP the fold is fine.


Hand 3: No need to squeeze to $40 with TT oop.  Its fine to check w that hand imo, some people will tell you otherwise.  Flop is an easy c/r as it is such a wet board.  If they flopped a straight then whatever its a cooler.   No one has TT or QQ as it was a limed pot.  You get value from all Kx, all xxhh, and all 2 pair combos.  Make it $75 or so on the flop.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> if youre going to donk the flop (which I highly recommend against) you shouldn't be leading for more than a PSB... wtf is with the sizing....


If villains range is so narrow, then why not c/r his cbet?  Also the turn jam is lol as you never get called by worse.

<TEXT> I don't think the type of nit villain you mentioned is c/r w an overpair on this flop.  I think he likely goes into c/c mode with 99-QQ.  I can expect him to show up w 88 here sometimes; completely reasonable for him to set mine here if youre that deep.  

I expect him to almost never have AA here. Probably going broke on this hand but wouldn't be surprised to see 88.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guess I'll go t keep this rolling.
Used to play in a 2/5 NL club game in college.  Some nights they would spread a 5/5 Uncapped - but it was usually scheduled like a week or 2 out.

Place had 2 off shift cops who worked the door, with their service pistols and wore them on their hip during the game hours.  The game was really actually pretty well run.  They offered cool perks - free drinks, free smokes, food runs, a lounge w an xbox/PS, pool table, some arcade games, and sometimes there were some methy looking hookers roaming around in there.  

I parked about a quarter of a block from the place one night and walked in to play the scheduled 5/5 game that night.  I brought 5k, was planning on 1.5k/1.5k/2k bullets (or top offs if it was playing deeper).  I ran pretty well and played pretty well and ran a stack up to 10k or so.  Game was slowing down, I had class, etc and decided to rack up.  Was given all the cash, checked outside the doors and cops let me walk to my car.  Someone sneaks up on me, or popped out of an alley, idk, but takes me in a headlock w one arm and pressed what I can only assume to be a gun in my back.  He says confidently "I know where you have been, just give me what you have in your pockets and we wont have any trouble"

I froze up a little and eventually forked over all the cash.  He took my cell phone an broke it in half so I couldn't call the cops (probably would not have anyway after playing in an illegal club game? idk).  Of course the club claims they had no knowledge of what happened, were not a part of it, and didn't think it was fishy.  Never went back there again now that im typing this im kinda getting pissed about it lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> The weird part about his line is the flop is so dry... rainbow flop and only straight draws are wheel wraps.
The fact that he has 3b here is strange to me.  I fee like 22xx and wheel wraps are flatting most of the time.  Bad aces is certainly possible as he is in SB and does not need to inflate the pot and play against 4 villains OOP. 
Seems kind of nitty, but the more I think about it I just give them credit unless you have them noted as a maniac.  Vs a solid reg I think its a fold. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always wondered whats optimal in these situations.
Hero sits w 200 BB and has two red Aces.  Raises to 8bb pre (this is a live cash game...) from UTG+1 and 5 people flat.  3 of them cover, one is short one has about 100bb.  

Flop is AT4 all spades... Whats our sizing?  Surely it depends on our table dynamic.  Whats our action if its LAGGY, as opposed to loose passive, and opposed to tight passive?

I have wondered if its optimal to bomb these flops, make smallish cbets for pot control if a spade hits the turn and we want to draw to fill up.  Interested what r/poker has to say about this situation </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've definitely noticed this dynamic in live poker too.  Sometimes you almost need to underbet the pot to get action.  If you have a nutted hand like this I don't think theres anything wrong w better smaller.

Think about it, how often have you seen OMC fire flop turn and river for $15 a pop w the immortal nuts?  And he gets called every time.... But if hes firing 75% pot all 3 streets, he NEVER gets action.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Congrats on your success.  I'm thinking of starting a similar challenge but wanted to set a loftier goal.  I haven't played too much online after Black Friday and have gone in spurts of 40+ hours a week live to playing almost zero hours in a month.  At the very least I would like to set a volume goal for live poker - but along with that should come some sort of bankroll challenge as well, I feel like.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's accusing you and your father for cheating or colluding against him. Basically by him betting and you raising you are isolating and making it a lot harder for he villain to continue the hand. When you fold the river it looks to him like you were raising and squeezing the villain off the hand only so your dad or yourself could win the pot. 

I can see why he would be upset, but it's hardly collusion... I would have just told him I had 47 and were counterfeited  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  RESULT:
I'm not happy with how I played this hand - even though it worked out.  My friend commented that he liked the line, but the more I look back at it I don't like it.  I tank checked, trying to make it look like a missed flop and cbet.  Villain fired $45, I thought for a 10 seconds or so and looked at his stack and jammed the rest in.  I got called and doubled through but I really got lucky to get all the chips in the middle I think.

I think betting the turn is necessary.  $80 or so seems like a good number.  It may induce some bluffs, but I think he draws w hands and gets stubborn w one pair type hands for this amount. </TEXT>

Sitting on around $500 in the hijack w QTcc and straddle from UTG.  One limp from a tight passive player w around $80 from MP, Hero pumps to $17 with one flat from button who is a drunk Mexican who is playing super strangely...limping AK, but cold calling w hands like 95o, sits on around $300.  Likes to bet when checked too, but likes to call a lot of bets too.  BB also flats, and MP folds ( LOL ).
Flop runs QT5sdc.  Checked to hero who bets $36, Mexican calls and bb folds. Turn is a 2c giving us top two and a fd.  


Bet (how much)? Check/r (how much?)
I'll provide turn action after some feedback. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really doubt he is shoving the river with KQ or QT.  Those hands are more or less bluff catchers after you bet the river and if he jams hes turning his hand into a bluff really.  I can maybe understand him taking this line with AQ (which we chop with). 

So river shove is crappy... We don't beat many hands that would shove river for value.  That being said we have 95 bucks back on the river with an effective 305 in the middle (30 pre, 60 on turn, 120 on turn - plus his shove of 95 effective).  With over 3:1 on a call here I think it sucks because he is either very nutted or completely aired; gotta rely on some table history/reads w this guy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think youre really lost in this idea that villain has trips if hes calling or raising.  This is one of the driest flops in poker - he almost NEVER has a 2 here.  

If we cbet and get called, its most likely 55-TT type of hand, some Jx, and MAYBE 2 overs like KQbdfd or QTbdfd like SkeetRag said.  If we bet and get called, outs are likely all Q and all A, and backdoor broadway cards; meaning if we turn a Q or A we can effectively extract 3 streets of value against some opponents.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seems super dry and we fold out a lot of whiffs.  I don't think people in 1/2 are floating this very much.  If we are confident our hand is the best why give a free one?  There's a lot of brick turns for us - do we check or lead?  If lead then what do we do on brick river? 

Seems like I'd rather just take a stab with like 20 on the flop, idk, personal preference.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I c-bet this flop with some regularity but whatever, check is fine.

Turn and river are fine.  I don't think he has many 2x in his range at all.  I expect to see AQ sometimes, JJ sometimes, and air sometimes really.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great post here.
I was going to comment something similar once OP posted desired speeds.  I can't imagine OP wants to spin his grinding wheel at 3600 RPM, that seems outrageously fast and dangerous for something of such mass.  So the question still remains, how fast do we want to spin?  We can also gear down an electric motor assuming it can produce enough torque, or, as I mentioned, go to a low speed high torque hydraulic motor...

Maybe I am biased as I used to be a hydraulic systems engineer :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> How fast do you need to spin it? Your startup torque will be the initial hurdle, I would assume a hydraulic motor would be much better suited for your needs as the power density is much greater than that of an electric motor </TEXT>

<TEXT> First post here... reg poster on 2+2, P5s etc but currently at work and unable to access, so now ill become a reddit reg :)

A friend of mine recently had this hand and was asking for advice/strat.  I have my own thoughts, was wondering what the community would offer.  Villain is a pretty solid reg but hero has little hand history with him. 

Hand in question is 2/5 NL.  Effective stacks are 650 and hero is in sb with [As](/As)[Ac](/Ac).  UTG open to 25 and folded to hero who 3b to 65.  UTG thinks and pops to 200.  
How do we continue the hand?  I think stack sizes make this a pretty interesting hand and not a unanimous correct answer.  
  
Option 1: flat and evaluate flop for c/r all in or lead/call
Option 2: shove pre
Option 3: 5b very small </TEXT>
