<TEXT> Oh man, Tuesday's with Morrie is the most emotional book I've ever read. It's in my top 5 of all time and I loved it ever since I read it for the first time back in high school.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely need some sort of twist ending, and I do want to work on interactions between the crew. I am leaning more towards the latter, with them arriving back to Earth relatively early on, and focusing on the after effects. This is where I'm stuck. What are the crew going to do now? Where do they go? Do they attempt to go back to the surface of the planet? Is the planet even still whole? Where did the survivors (if any) flee to...perhaps the moon? Mars? I'm hoping to have some ideas spit out for me to sift through and expand upon. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help me develop this hard sci-fi idea? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-19 03:43:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Sorry if this isn't allowed here, but I have an idea for a novel, but I'm looking for some ideas to help develop my single idea into a plot. This is just a fun little project I'm doing for myself to try my hand at writing something other than non-fiction. I'm trying to keep this theoretically possible. So here's my little blurb:

The Earthen Federation (or some sort of government) creates a new, advanced ship with the first ever warp drive. A small group of engineers, scientists, and pilots are selected to take said ship on the first test of its new warp drive. All seems to go well, however, when returning after what they have assumed to be only a day or two, they return to an Earth in ruins. A side effect of the warp drive was inadvertent time dilation due to the distance travelled. This wasn't anticipated, as they assumed the warp drive would move them instantaneously, whereas in reality they experienced the full amount of time (relative) of traveling to the location and back without the warp factor.

This (to me) seems like a good opening act of a novel, but as far as how to get to this point, and what to base the rest of the story on is beyond me. So, I'm looking for ideas to help develop this premise. Plot points, sub plots, etc.  </TEXT>

I usually don't go out to the theater too much, because I spent thousands of dollars to create my own home theater in my living room haha. As far as music, I listen to just about everything. Some favorite bands include Panic! at the Disco, Pink Floyd, Mother Mother, The Beatles, Billy Joel, Daft Punk, and Anything Classical, or Musicals. How about yourself? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well hello there! Let me first start by saying I'm a 27 year old male with almost identical interests as yourself. I'm a classical pianist, love literature of all eras, own a 1930's typewriter which I use quite often to spark my creativity, have a weak spot for musical theater, and almost double majored in English and Philosophy. (Currently working on my second degree...Physics with a minor in Math). I'm looking for a snail mail pen-pal that I can handwrite (or use my typewriter!) to on a regular basis. I love talking books, philosophy, science, music. I'm also a hopeless romantic. So there's that. PS, I'm also a fellow INFP. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Translation differences in From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-31 23:21:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, a little information about me: I read physical copies of books during the day, and the ebook at night, in bed. Recently though, while reading From the Earth to the Moon, I started out reading my Bantam Classics edition physically, and when I went to read the ebook, I noticed it was COMPLETELY different. Literally every sentence is written much differently, some parts are completely omitted, and some seem like they were added. I can tell that the ebook is the original translation (i.e. they mention the War of the Rebellion as opposed to the newer translation listing it as The Civil War). 

Anyway, the point of this rant...what is your opinion on something like this? Have you run across translations where the ebook is completely different than the physical copy? I feel like I'm reading two different books when I go between them and it sucks! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-11-08 15:45:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm throwing together an honest trailer for a board game. If you've never seen honest trailers, check out the YouTube channel ScreenJunkies. They're hilarious! But I digress, this is just a fun little project for myself to go into a demo reel, so I'm not able to offer much. How about $10? Looking for someone with a deep voice much like you'd see in a movie trailer. (Think the clich "In a world...").

Sample of the script:

"For anyone who aspires to be Indiana Jones, but from the comfort of their dining room table comes a fast paced, temple exploration game by Queen Games.

With exciting features like:

Rolling dice to discover new chambers
Rolling dice to move around
Rolling dice to acquire gems
Rolling dice to unlock treasure chests
Rolling dice to roll more dice.

Seriously, this is all you do."

Please post a sample below if interested! Thanks!!

Edit: Completed. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> An iPhone or iPad would work perfectly. You can set one up stationary and use an app to remotely control its camera controls and shutter. Some apps even allow you to have the photos directly sent to a computer as you take them, allowing you to leave the camera still without having to move it to do anything. 

Edit: Here is a link to the one I've used with much success. 

Remote Shutter - Camera Timer with Lens filter by i-App Creation Co., Ltd.

Edit 2: Here is another similar app, however I have no experience with it personally but it seems like it would do the trick.

As far as the weighted keys, they seem a little heavy to me, it takes a few minutes to go between my digital and an acoustic piano, but again, for the price, I can't really complain. I would definitely recommend it if you're on a budget.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was watching a documentary on fallout shelters, and in the discussion someone had posted this:

"Know this, if and when Marshal law is in effect, the decision has been made not to try to evacuate those whom are in bunkers, the reason is the safety of the officials and the public as the occupants are heavily armed, and equipped, so as in such an event, the order will be made, if no answer is to come from the located bunker in short time given warnings over radio, or international Morse code .. order is to . weld them shut."

Is this a true statement? And if so, I how could that possibly be legal?

<TEXT> Haha I do like the idea of the energy efficiency. It will be a constant temperature throughout the year. As far as natural light, I wouldn't be too concerned as my design for the tiny house itself is half glass. The basement would be designed as a true fallout shelter, feet of concrete and rebar, and many feet below ground. 

With regards to emergency exits, it would be similar to a standalone shelter, a main entrance i.e. ladder from the house, as well as an emergency exit, via a tunnel or stairwell to the surface at another part of the property.

I never thought about covering the basement in grass. How feasible would that be? It would need sunlight to grow, no? It would need to be mowed. I don't know how well it would work out to have an underground lawn. Although the idea surely is fascinating.

edit: grass. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I've always loved the idea of having a huge basement/fallout shelter under my house. I also love the idea of having a Tiny House. I was wondering how possible it would be to build the basement, cover it up, and build a tiny house over top of it. The house would be much smaller compared to the size of the basement, and in the house would be a trap door in the floor that opens up to a ladder that you would descend down into the basement/shelter. Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TITLE> I Made a Complete Game Checklist for Every Console (US Only), And am Looking for Feedback! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-12 04:37:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! Throughout the years of my collecting, I have always wished I had a definitive list of games for each console. Ive spent many, many hours creating such a list, and Im ready to beta test it, if you will. Im looking to get some feedback, as well as hear what you would like to see implemented in it in a future release. Im also toying around with the idea of writing this into an iPhone/iPad app to give it a bit more functionality.

Heres some of the features Ive implemented so far:

* Available in 2 formats; .numbers (For Mac and iPhone/iPad), and Google Docs (For PC)
* The .numbers version is designed to integrate perfectly with your iPad, allowing you to scroll between consoles, and tap the checkboxes to add a game to your collection.
* Each game, for each system is split into three checkboxes, indicating Game, Box, and Instructions.
* Each console is split into three separate sections: Games (Licensed), Unlicensed Games, and Other. Other includes items such as Demo Carts/Discs, etc.
* In the interactive version, as you check systems off your list, it will automatically count your total and display it at the bottom of the list, along with the total amount of games in that particular category.
* The Table of Contents page includes a listing of each console in the order it appears, along with the total amount of licensed games needed for that set, the number that you currently have, and the percentage of completion you are at.
* Consoles that are still seeing new games are listed under (Other), at the end of the document, and games will be entered manually by the collector, as there is no definitive list yet. In exchange for providing this, please do not remove my copyright.

As I receive feedback, I will make changes to the original files and list them here.

[Mac/iPad Version - Be sure to "Open in Numbers"](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1cb685e45p43uai/AADEtWXMolrAVGNiW1cRviUya)

[Google Docs Version (Place an "X" in the box for it to be counted)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dWx7AkVqol71gwsNlk4PMsO5qdn5_yD7Au6ozHl0q8c/edit?usp=sharing)


EDIT 1: Ported the Mac version to Google Docs. Doesn't look as nice as the iOS version, but it's functional.

EDIT 2: Added Neo Geo, Neo Geo CD, Neo Geo Pocket

EDIT 3: Added a Version number to the Table of Contents so you always know if you have the most up to date copy.

EDIT 4: Added 3DO

EDIT 5: Both Versions now update total amount on Table of Contents automatically (V1.1)

EDIT 6: Version 1.11 - Added 3 games to Nintendo GameCube (Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings, Baten Kaitos: Origins, Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As is common practice for many a collector, consoles are normally displayed and stored out of the box, as to prevent damage from opening/closing the box more than necessary. I'm wondering what everyone's preferred method of displaying/storing their games is.

Me personally, I store the games out of their boxes. For example, I have a shelf for all my loose NES games in sleeves. On another shelf, I have the boxes to said games where applicable. For Sealed copies of games, I usually purchase a loose copy as well to display with the loose games.

Games for consoles such as the Sega Genesis, are made to be stored in their box, so for those such games, I keep them in the box, and for the loose ones, they are on a separate shelf until I can acquire boxed copies of them.

How do you display your games? </TEXT>

I'm currently working on a pretty ambitious project that I can't fully disclose right now but it will be revealed on kickstarter pretty soon. 

I'm seeking advice and designs for a modern looking museum with a retro feel. I have a basic layout in mind, with room for expansion however I have no architectural imagination whatsoever. If anyone has any experience with this sort of thing I would greatly appreciate some help and would love to hear from you.

<TEXT> I have a story developed for a text based game that I'd like to create, however, I'm trying to find the best way to go about doing it in Unity. The lower half of the screen would be a console of sorts, with the input/output text and would be the main part of the game. The upper half would display sprites and images that would change based off of the advancement of the storyline.

What would be the best method to create the input/output text system? Could it be scripted in C# and then set to display the output and recieve the input from a window on screen? Or is there a more visual way to do this? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Good morning reddit. I'm trying to hone my animation skills but don't have any fully rigged/controlled character models. I have a model with a skeleton that I would like to use however it does not have a control rig attached to it and I'm afraid I don't have the skills to make a complete rig. Would anyone be willing to help out and put a complete functional control rig with driven keys, facial controls, etc. onto my model? It would be greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the advice. I'm not looking to spend more than $2,500 at the moment for a portable solution. Seeing as the specs are greatly increased from the 2011 model to the Late 2013 model, I'm guessing that it will probably handle a bit more intensive animating. (the i7 in it is rated only a few points lower than the PC model i7-4770 according to cpubenchmark.net), and having 16 gigs of ram, it should fare quite well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting, I was always under the impression that the GPU is what helped with rendering. With that logic then, I'm assuming I should get decent performance from an i7 in the MBP. I am going to be upgrading my desktop to possibly a Mac Pro (Xeon) in the future, but for now I am looking for something portable that I can get by with for rendering out animations as I need to be able to work on it at home and at work. </TEXT>

Also, you're running it on just integrated graphics?? I'm sure that this 750M will give a huge improvement in render speeds then.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As the title states, I'm looking for some reviews of Maya's performance on a MacBook Pro (Retina).

2.3 GHz i7
16 Gb Ram
GT 750M (2 GB)

I'm mostly an animator, so I'm concerned about viewport performance when animating, as well as render time and heat created while rendering. I'm coming from a PC that I put together a few years ago:

AMD Phenom X4 255 (3.2 GHz)
8 Gb Ram
GTX 660 (2 GB)

Anyone with insight as to how they would compare would be greatly appreciated. The reason I am making the switch is because I MUCH prefer the OS X operating system, and I need a portable solution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll experiment like you said using simple geometry, and I agree, it is part of the fun! And it is going to animate from old, crumbled ruins, to what it used to look like when it was new. As for that, I suppose I could just use the new geometry and then change the textures and break it up, and just animate it in reverse so to say, and put a render layer for each texture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That seems like a decent workflow, however, my camera is going to be moving, so it will definitely be very render intensive. Also, the set itself, as well as the character's clothing, will be changing geometry, not just textures/materials.

I suppose, using render layers, I could put both geometries in, like you suggested for the textures and then follow your advice for the transitioning using masks and effects.

During the transition area, how would you go about doing that? A third render layer? And then composite the three together? </TEXT>

I'm not looking for anything rare or expensive, just something fairly cheap to diversify my collection. More of a conversation piece than rare piece of history. Let me know what you have!  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Sorry if it doesn't belong here but you all are more familiar with Provident than other subreddits. I just wanted to hear some silverbugs opinions on diamonds as an investment. It doesn't seem too promising to me because the value of every diamond is different whereas metals have a set value. Although they are selling quite cheap. Opinions?

<TEXT> That's some good information there. So far I've only dealt with two suppliers, Monarch and Bullion Direct. I was extremely happy with Monarch but not so much on BD. I'll probably give Westminster a shot and get a few generics although Monarch is most likely going to be my primary supplier  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for you're opinion. I actually did see that post a while back, however I'm more looking for opinions about their generic bullion and not so much about the company itself, as I have heard good things about them.

I do own a tube of buffalo's and those are no-named, however I was under the impression that they are well known and I would have no problem reselling when the time came. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I only ask this because I noticed they have very good prices. They have a large selection of silver rounds in some pretty nice looking designs, and as of right now are only about $1 over spot. I'm hesitiant, however, because there are no mint markings or anything showing where the silver came from and who minted it. Would you trust those rounds, does anyone already own any and can vouch for them?

<TITLE> Casting/Selling Home Poured Silver, Could Use Some Advice! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-27 01:34:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, I have a question or two. By trade, I am a Graphic Designer and 3D Modeler. I'd like to integrate my skills with one of my hobbies, Silver hoarding!

I have been looking into pouring my own silver bars for some time now and have access to all the equipment needed, including a CNC mill (for making custom molds) for more intricate pieces down the line. For now I'm planning on just doing simple hand poured, hand stamped bars of varying weights. I am getting a custom stamp with my logo, as well as a set of alphanumeric stamps.

My question is this: Is it worth all the effort to buy .999 silver shot for pennies over spot and then casting my own bars and products to sell? And also, is it legal for me to stamp them with .999FS and the weight. I won't be changing the purity, just melting and pouring. Is this something people would buy, or not really?

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!

Whenever I try using the new modeling toolkit, my mesh will turn Transparant and look almost X-rayed. However none of those options are selected in the viewport and there is no way other than closing and reppening the software to fix it. Any suggestions? Thanks! </TEXT>

The chase car is in radio contact with the pilots and once it touches down, two "pogo stick" wheels are placed on the wings so that it can taxi, since the only wheels on it are the two down the center of the fuselage. </TEXT>
