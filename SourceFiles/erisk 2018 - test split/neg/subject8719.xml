Hi, guys.

In Part 1 I explained what happened in that godforsaken building and how we had to leave Sebastian behind. It's been almost a week since we escaped and until today, I thought my best friend, the guy who had stuck with me since we were teenagers, was dead.

Unable to get the police involved - we would be looking at a *long* time in jail if they knew what we had done - I decided that we were going to take matters into my own hands. My grandfather used to take me shooting when I was younger and I inherited his old rifle when he passed away, and Callum managed to get ahold of a wicked hunting knife.

All that proved unneccary, however, when I heard a sharp knocking on my front door yesterday evening. Callum looked up from his computer (just thought I should mention that he was staying around to plan our trip). I set off downstairs and opened the door.

My jaw dropped. It was Sebastian. "Holy shit" was all I could utter as he stepped through the door, offering a weak smile and slumping into an armchair. He looked like he had aged in the short time he was missing. His skin was unnervingly pale and seemed almost droopy, and he smelt a little off too, but a man who'd spent the best part of a week surviving being hunted by what you guys have labelled a wendigo he didn't look that bad.

Callum grabbed him a beer as I sat across the room from him in awe. I honestly couldn't believe he was back.

We sat quietly by the TV for a bit, before I could muster up the courage to speak. "What happened to you, man?" I asked. Sebastian frowned, and when he spoke there was something definitely off about his voice. It wavered slightly and he seemed to be struggling to speak. "I came back"

There was another awkward silence before Callum started to describe what we were planning to do to rescue him, but before he could finish Seb lunged to his feet with an unearthly bellow. "NO!" the hairs on my neck prickled as he stood there, twitching slightly as Callum and I exchanged concerned looks. "Are you feelin' alright?" I queried. The glare I received was the fiercest I've ever seen in my life. "I'M FINE."

By this point, it was beginning to get late. For fear of upsetting Sebastian further, I offered him the sofa to sleep on and that we all turn in for the night. He nodded and curled up in a ball as Callum and I trotted upstairs. 

Neither of us spoke as we slowly got ready for bed, but we both knew something was wrong with out friend. I wrote it off as just shell shock 
from the time he spent in the sanatorium and fell into an uneasy sleep.

I awoke in the early hours of the morning. I wasn't acutely aware of what woke me until I saw him, stood there in the doorway. It was Seb, or rather it wasn't. Hunched over and leaning against the frame of the door, he wheezed and rasped as his glinting eyes surveyed the room. His gaze locked onto me as the all too familiar smell of copper filled my nostrils, almost making me gag.

I held my breath and lay still until I heard him returning along the hall and downstairs. Then, after an ominous silence, the shattering of glass. The fuck? I jumped out of bed, snatching the rifle from my desk as Callum jolted awake.

By the time I got downstairs, he was long gone, leaving a smashed window in his place. I called the police, clutching the gun in my hands until I heard them pulling up in my drive.

I gave them a heavily edited version of the events of the past week: Seb had mentioned going to some abandoned place, followed by what had happened when he returned. I didn't like to drop him in it but there was something wrong with him and I refuse to believe that it isn't related to what we saw in the sanatorium.

Since then, he hasn't been seen again. But I've heard him. Clicking and wheezing away. Right outside my window.

I don't know what happened to the man I called my best friend. But let this serve as a warning. Places like hospitals, laboratories and sanatorium. They're abandoned for a reason </TEXT>

My friends and I are urban explorers. For anybody who doesn't know what that means, in a nutshell we explore abandoned buildings for fun. Hope that isn't too underwhelming of a description.

I digress. Outside of town, a mile or two into the forest, is an old, abandoned sanatorium. It's been empty for decades, and was just left there to rot. In other words, the perfect place to let ourselves into. I'll spare you the whole planning and preparation stage of this story, because I'm sure you get the idea, but within a few days we had gathered some necessities: torches, spare batteries, little masks for avoiding a lungful of asbestos, beer... the works.

It was about noon when we finally pulled up to the place. I wanted to leave earlier but Sebastian's a lazy bastard and nearly bailed on us in favour of laying in all day. Despite it being a fairly warm day, the building had an unsettling vibe to it. The closer we got to the entrance, the weirder I felt, and I could sense the hairs on the back of my neck prickling as we scouted the area. The doors would most likely be locked, but I spied a high-up window that had seemingly been completely removed and would make a perfect entry point. 

Walking up to the hole in the brickwork, I motioned for Sebastian - I'll start referring to him as Sebastian - to give me a leg up. Months of relying on teamwork and co-ordination to get us in and out of places like these were paying off as I pushed myself through the window and dropped down into the unknown.

The first thing I noticed about the room, as Callum dropped in behind me, was how cold it was. Outside it was still reasonably warm, but just a few metres in it was evidently at least a couple degrees lower. A tap on my shoulder nearly made me jump out of my skin as Callum explained that Seb couldn't climb up on his own and would wait at the entrance for us to unlock the doors. I nodded in agreement as my torch flicked on and the room was lit up.

We were in some kind of archive room. Shelves lined the walls, mostly empty but with a few old papers lining them. Callum looked briefly at a few but, finding nothing interesting, we moved on. My breath felt hot against my face as I circled a desk shoved carelessly into the middle of the room, bushing my fingers against its dusty surface. The wood felt chipped and slightly jagged in places as I withdrew my touch and followed Callum into the next room.

Connected to the archive room was a small office space. It too had been cleared out, leaving behind a musty aroma and a huge hole in the ceiling, wires dangling down from above. I stepped out into some kind of corridor, about to ask Callum what he thought when I heard some kind of noise.

It was faint. Very faint. An odd raspy clicking that seemed to rattle through the building. I honestly wasn't sure what it was, but I felt goosebumps forming up my arms. Callum heard it too. "What was that?" he asked.

I shrugged. A lot of old buildings make weird noises, most likely due to their crumbling foundations, and even though there was something unnatural about the way this rattled through the vicinity.

Either way, we kept moving in search of the entrance and I discovered what seemed to be the lobby. The two metal front doors were blocked off by some debris that had fallen from the ceiling. I shouted through the doors at Seb, letting him know what was up. The rebar protruding from the ceiling seemed easy enough to shift, but there was no way of telling whether or not the whole building would come down with it. Callum vetoed that it would be unwise to move it, telling Seb to find another way in, and we stood there in silence until I heard footsteps crunching away through the leaves.

As we turned to resume our exploration, the noises rattled through the building again. It was... a lot louder this time. Almost as though the source was moving towards us. Accompanying it was a very strange smell, of copper - like when you taste a coin. The noise eventually trailed off into a hoarse croak, and we looked at each other.

"No way is that the building. Somebody's messing with us." Callum exclaimed, shining his torch down the gloomy corridor we had previously exited from. I wasn't sure, myself, but suggested we keep moving. 

We explored further for a while, finding little other than old documentations of patients - none of which caught my attention - and long abandoned furniture. Then I saw it. Tucked away between two desks, barely visible under the thick coating of dust that had accumulated over tens of years, was a metal hatch leading into the ground. I walked up to it, tugging at the handle and fighting against the two decades worth of rusting.

It was difficult, but with Callum's help the hatch popped open, leaving us to peer down into the abyss.

The hole was very deep. You could scarcely see the bottom even with both flashlights aimed directly down the drop. Every part of me begged me to not enter that hatch but I felt myself slowly lowering my body into the unknown. The only thing I could hear was the blood rushing through my head. I was about to let go of the sides and drop down below when I noticed how eerily quiet the room had become. Not a single creak or crack. And... the smell had come back. The disgusting, coppery stench was once more assaulting my nostrils and I felt bile rising up my throat.

I looked up at Callum, who was beginning to back away. He pointed at the hole beneath my feet. I looked down.

Just a few metres below me was a slender, emaciated figure. Its skin was pale and deprived of sunlight, taught and stretching over its bloodied lips. Its eyes were wide and soulless, yet they showed a deep and insatiable hunger, as this hideous thing reached up towards me with an outstretched arm. Reaching for my legs which were dangling right above its goddamned lair.

I felt sick, paralysed with fear as the creature slowly drew nearer. I couldn't move. If it weren't for Callum reaching down and hauling me out of the way, who knows what would have happened? He yanked me out of the hole and I slammed the hatch shut as the angry screams of the creature echoed from underneath the metal hatch. It didn't close all the way and I could see long fingers stretching out from underneath the lid.

The next thing I knew, Callum was leading me away from the room as I heard the ear rending grating of metal from somewhere behind us. We made it back to the archive room and he boosted me out of the window. I clawed my way out, crying and spotting as Callum followed suit.

We ran back to the car, leaves crunching underfoot as the sky grew darker and darker, leaving that wretched place behind us. I scrambled into the front seat and started the engine, pulling out of the entrance and starting to drive away. Callum's hand fell onto my shoulder. "Where's Sebastian?"

It felt like a punch to the gut. Sebastian had to have gotten inside by now. That thing was in there with him. My foot paused over the accelerator. We couldn't leave him.

Then the piercing shriek of the creature rang through the evening sky and self preservation took over. I stamped down onto the pedal and we sped away from the building.

It's been three days and there's been no sign of Sebastian. We've tried calling him. No answer. We can't call the police. If they knew we went there, both of us would be in serious trouble. There's no way they would believe us, anyway.

We have to go back. I'm dreading it with every fibre of my being but as soon as we're prepared - with guns - I'm going to go back there with as many people as possible and save my friend.

That's my story, Reddit. I'll update if anything else happens, but for now any advice would be appreciated.
