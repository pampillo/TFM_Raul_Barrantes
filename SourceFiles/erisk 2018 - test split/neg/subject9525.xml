Get another burst damage potential support and/or carries and you're set even if you're close to a team fight. Watch kuro's aa games. He's always pretty close to the fights. And almost always clips at least 3 people with his ult even if he only hits one of the enemies. The aoe gold after a kill doesn't hurt with the aghs rush either. Try it out. GLHF.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm just thinking on the lines of set up for the egg, mate. And the draft would benefit more from a support duo who can set up each other instead of a void or ds in the core line up + insane amount of sustenance. Sure, they will lack a bit in the disable department but once the laning phase is done, there are hardly any core heroes who will keep farming (except maybe spectre, but haunt so...) and because the supports are self sufficient in ensuring a good team fight, core picks can be more damage or push oriented instead of more team fight. Imagine this lineup: ck, Dp, treant, tide, Phoenix. 
You got the crowd control from tide, pushing power and team fight from Dp as well ck, sustain from bird laser, living armour. And they have plenty of catch from ck stun, Dp silence, tide gush.  </TEXT>

Treant can get away with being greedy in that case. Also, ppd is the one who plays treant on EG (the one team I'm expecting it from). And he doesn't play greedily at all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Yes, The International is the biggest tournament in Dota 2. Valve recently introduced the Majors system. Now, including TI, there will be 4 major tournaments organised by valve throughout the year. You can check those out. Teams qualify that through open qualifier matches for the Americas, Europe, SEA and China. Some teams are directly invited to participate in these tournaments based on their previous performances or standings in the world of pro dota2. 
2. There's no one best player or team in the pro Dota scene. You make up your own opinions as is the case with all other sports (as you well know, Dota is now a sport in itself). 
3. You'll get to see and understand all the strategies and playstyles of teams and individual players only by watching them play. Some rat, some play head on. Some slow the game down and outfarm their enemies. But the current meta favors huge team fights and taking advantages past those team fights. 
4. There are tons of analytical articles on gosugamers or joindota. You can check those out. Also, check out a channel called simply Dota. Roro gives us good analysis of the individual game play and helps us see where we can improve ourselves.

<TEXT> Consider this situation. You've lost all or most of your tier 2 towers. You need to take towers and take back map control before they snowball. 
Would a deso be good in this situation to push out the wave faster, take a tower, tp back, defend and repeat?

<TEXT> A huge chunk of his income does come from killing heroes. But a battlefury is good at clearing waves, works good on clumped enemies during Omnislash and it doesn't hurt to farm faster 
Ember gets a battlefury because sleight of fist is a mini Omnislash. 
So, basically the same principle

<TEXT> Mom is a common item, so I added that. 
I agree with you about manta and skadi. 
But I'm asking if desolator is a good item in the situation that you've lost plenty of towers and you need to counter push fast and then tp back (basically rat) 
Or your opponents are high armour and you have no other way to counter that
Situational is the keyword.  </TEXT>

Sometimes basher is picked up, yes. But the most picked up items are stats based items </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most popular = the build that is most commonly made by most professional players 
Aghs is expensive and ends up being overkill because juggernaut scales really well. 
And if you need lifesteal, vlad's would be better because of all the stats + aura 
So, no. I don't mean the mom + aghs build </TEXT>

<TITLE> Desolator on Juggernaut? </TITLE>

<TEXT> The current most popular build on Juggernaut is battlefury into agility items. 
Desolator would provide him some extra damage + the armor reduction will work wonders with Omnislash. 
Is it a good item to build for him? 
If not, why so?  </TEXT>
