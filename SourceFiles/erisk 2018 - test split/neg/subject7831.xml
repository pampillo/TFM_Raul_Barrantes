[[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/69p2ge/willow_house_investigation_day_two/)]

I started this log in order to keep a written account and diary of hard cold facts.  There were only two options in my mind.  One being that we would describe the logical ways in which these phenomenon were occurring, the other being an account of facts that could not be reasonably explained. "Facts" and "evidence" now seemed like the candy I would eat as a child.  Sweet, indulgent, plentiful and deceptive but without nourishment, without truth, without sustenance.  I craved the mundane now that I had seen the lie of it. More than ever before I wanted that assured false sense of reality back.

The night following our previous investigation was distressing to say the least. The night I arrived home, showered and turned in, it began.  I recall awaking from a nightmare only to find that I was still in it.  I could feel cold limbs pressing my shoulders to the bed, holding me on my back as my eyes widened and I tried to scream.  The limbs were hard, cold and sectioned like the limbs of an enormous exoskeleton. What I saw before my eyes was little more than the dreamy swimming darkness that seems so rich with the life behind the eyes as you squeeze them shut.  But I could feel it. I could feel the cold dead weight on my body.  I could feel the putrid snorting breath on my face seeming to come from both sides.  I could feel a pain, no not a pain, a pulling in my chest as I began to fear blacking out.

I could also feel that sensation rise in me.  It began as a stirring just above my genitals.  The stirring turned into a warm whirlwind that quickly shot upwards through my throat as I hoarsely yelled.

"No!" The shout hung in the dead air.  The room now devoid of everything.  The room now empty, quiet, real.

I pulled the blankets off of me and ran for the standing lamp to illuminate the space and confirm what I already knew.  It was gone. Over. Whatever I had experienced was finished, as sharply as if a mesmerist had clapped his hands loudly bringing his subject out from hypnosis. I could not sleep.  I considered reading, but was far too distracted.  I thought about taking a bath to calm down but I could not bring myself to sit naked and vulnerable in the bathroom with the door shut or open. I headed to the fridge to make myself a snack and a drink.  That's when I heard my ringtone from the bedroom.

"Jesus Jason, what the fuck are we doing... I can't do this, it has too...I think..." It was Thomas and he was clearly hysterical. "It fucking... Fuck man are you there?"

I assured him I was listening.

"It followed me man. Fuck, It's here... or it was and...." He took several long breaths.

"Me too Tom.  Just minutes ago." I felt for him. I understood his terror.

"It was everywhere.  Slamming doors, opening drawers.  I swear my house shook, I don't know what the fuck to do man, what do we do?" 

Clearly neither of us would sleep tonight and I decided that we should get together. I knew that I would feel much better if I was not alone.  Shit. Alone. Neither of us.  The disparate thoughts coalesced in my mind and I started to feel a panic before I had even formed the thought.

"Tom, have you heard from Sam?" I asked hurriedly.

He hadn't.  Neither had I.  It seemed reasonable that if this thing had followed us both, then it must have followed Sam as well.  I told Tom that I was on my way to his place which was very close to Sam's.  I called her several times on the way, and each time I got no response.  By the time I arrived, I was beyond consolation thinking of her and had Tom ready on the road near his house to swing straight over to Sam's apartment building.

Buzz. Buzz. Another and another.  No answer was forthcoming.  We had seen her car in the lot outside the building so we knew she was home.  The sinking feeling in my stomach was stopped short when we began to hear muffled banging from inside.  

We looked at each other and both simultaneously said "We need to get in there".

"Kick the door open!" Thomas yelled.

"You've got to be kidding I'm not doing that. You do it." Embarrassed by my immediate childishness in an emergency.

We looked around and decided that we could reach the kitchen window if we moved some trash barrels below it.  We would smash it if we had to, but once I was up I discovered that I could easily push both the screen and window up.  In a series of extremely clumsy motions I was over her kitchen sink and pulling Tom into the apartment.  We followed the banging sounds into her bedroom tripping over the clutter of dirty clothes and knocking over her bong along the way.

The banging was coming from the closet in her bedroom. We could see the door reverberating with the assault it was receiving from the inside.  My feet remained planted quite far back as I cautiously reached out and turned the doorknob.  When the door swung open we saw our friend.

Her eyes were wide and red and full of tears and mascara. Her face and arms seemed covered in scratches, some bleeding moderately.  Her ankles were bruised.  After a moment of slow recognition she sprung from the closet and embraced us both sobbing into our ears as she hung on our shoulders.

That night we sat in the diner until 3am talking and comforting each other as we shared our experiences. We talked until we felt that we had turned these nightmares into stark facts. Facts we could speak about in the light of day.  War wounds that soon we became somewhat proud and exhilarated to bear.  We also got to business. Samantha managed to reach her friend and relay the evenings happenings.  Once she understood the severity she agreed to meet us the very next day at the Willow Street house and do anything possible to end this.

***

The conversation I had with Mrs. Felworth the next day was quite strained.  She was clearly unable to sleep or cope with what was going on.  I informed her that we would visit that day with the sole intention of removing this thing from her home, and that we were part of it now with her.  I tried to ensure her so that she did not feel alone.  I'm not sure that it worked, but she was certainly eager to try, and agreed to host us that evening after Lily's Karate class.

Thomas, Samantha, Dawnstar and I had planned to arrive at six o'clock.  We had packed up all of our gear this time wanting to document and study everything possible tonight.  We had five camera's and one portable, the recorder, EMF reader, a pair night vision goggles, flashlights and headlamps, one digital and one film camera, as well as a container of holy water. 

Our van cruised down the highway when Dawnstar said dreamily. "It found us".

That very moment we heard what sounded like a gunshot, as the van veered hard to the right towards a ditch.  I managed to pull hard on the wheel keeping us swerving back and forth between the breakdown lanes, narrowly missing an SUV, until we could safely come to a stop. We had blown a tire.  Or a tire had blown.  With all of us working on it we had the spare on in all of ten minutes and proceeded.

We getting very close to the house when I saw something in the road and slammed on the brakes, screeching to a halt.

Before us maybe five feet from the hood of the car stood a Buck with a full rack of antlers.  It was standing perfectly still, and facing the side of the road. It was almost entirely covered in blood, and the eye that we could see from our side had fallen from the creature's face and hung.  Even with a single busted eye visible the animal seemed stunned.  We looked around for the car that must have hit the buck, but the stretch of road was empty.

We heard rustling in the van and looked back to see Dawnstar, in her little hippie dress and sweater, tearing through her large pack.  She extracted two knives, one with a black handle, and one with a white one.  She tossed the white handled knife back into her pack and exited the vehicle.  We were all too stunned to speak.  We just watched her.  We watched her proceed languidly up to the creature in the road before us and slowly put a her hand to the side of it's face, clearly not bothered by the blood and flesh there.  Her frame looked minuscule near the beast but after a moment she rose onto her bare toes and with one quick slash cut the animal's throat.  She didn't move back, or even remove her hand from stroking it's face.  She did raise her other hand and hold the animals chin up as blood charged from it's neck in pulses that slowly grew more infrequent.  After a time, the animal fell and Dawnstar returned.

She calmly cleaned and returned her knife to her bag.  Then whispering something to herself she wiped the blood from her fingers between her eyes in a small vertical line. She cleaned her hands and looked around to each of us in turn, unfazed by our shocked faces.

 "It made a mistake.  We're connected now." This was spoken very naturally, in light of what we had just witnessed. "Let's get there. You can drive around."

We did.  And we arrived shortly thereafter.

***

Mrs. Felworth was quite taken aback by Dawnstar's appearance being that she had blood on her forehead, but with some limited conversation about what had happened on the way, and assurances that she was a person who had some experience with situations like theirs, she was welcoming.  Once again Lily remained in her room as we setup our gear. This time Dawstar had some setup to accomplish as well. She removed three long wooden slats from her bag, white and covered in symbols.  She placed them in the shape of a triangle under the kitchen table. She then poured table salt in a large circle on the hardwood floor in the den several feet from the table. We focused on our equipment and did not question or interfere with what she was doing.  Seeing what I had just seen earlier I trusted this person to have the knowledge and wherewithal to accomplished what she had promised she could.

Once we were prepared Mrs. Felworth brought her daughter out in her little sleeping gown to sit at the table with us.  She looked angry and defiant.  She was clearly not happy to see us and we sat in silence for a moment.

"Lily.  Last time we were here I lied to you.  I want to apologize.  That was not very nice of me." I pleaded with my eyes.  It took her several moments to meet them.

Eventually her face and body relaxed and she smiled. "It's ok.  I lie too sometimes."

"Thank you Lily.  You're quite grown up to be able to forgive me for being mean." We needed her cooperation, and I was happy that I was able to be the one to get on her good side.  Tom had always been so much better with children than I.  "We want to talk to Mister Thin-Man one last time.  Would you let us use your board?  We have a new friend for him to talk to." I nodded towards Dawnstar.

She agreed and ran happily to her room, grabbing and setting up the board on the table just as she had before. She looked at Dawnstar for some time before slowly handing over the planchette to her. It was if Lily had not wanted to, but could not resist.

Dawnstar took it softly from Lily and addressed her directly. "You know that we won't be friends don't you Lily?"

"Yes" Lily looked down at her lap.

"You know why too, don't you? You know that Thin Man does not belong here.  That he is bad for people, even if he seems friendly."

Lily stayed quiet.

"I am calling upon the spirit that is called Thin-Man, Mister Thin-Man. Come and speak with us at my behest!" This was a loud as I had ever heard Dawnstar speak.

Her hands instantly shot around in circles on the board at speed. She bent her head backward and closed her eyes as her body jeered with the circling motion of her arms.

  "I feel you here. Give me you name spirit!" She demanded.

In rapid succession she received T...H...I....

"By the highest and by the lowest, Give me your true name!" She interrupted the response.

T...H...I...

"Lily, do you have crayons and paper?" She asked playfully. When she said that she did, Dawnstar had her fetch them and bring them to the table. "Now Lily, I need you to draw for me.  I want you to think of Thin-Man, think about what his skeleton must look like underneath.  Can you draw it? Like a stick figure."

"Sure, I'll try." She agreed.  She drew a long bent line and then three sets of branched lines across it.  "That's him I think."

Dawnstar told her she did an excellent job and took the paper, and then a lighter from her pocket.  She let go of the board and held the paper over Mrs. Felworth's tea cup and flicked the lighter.  Everyone pushed back in their seats from the table when we saw the Planchette jerk.  No one was touching it now, but it moved several inches, resting over the "No" printed on the board.

Dawnstar put her instruments down and returned her hands to the planchette.  "You have one last chance, I demand by the most high and by the dwellers of the most low. By the winds, the fire, the tumult of earth and by the sea, I demand that you give me your true and faithful name!"

A...Q...R...A...B...U...A...M...E...L...U

"I need everyone to leave the table now and go into the den.  Stand in the circle but please do not disturb the salt." Dawnstar's command was both quiet and unquestionable.

We did as she asked, Mrs. Felworth guiding her daughter over.

"Aqrabuamelu, I command you to leave this location. I command you to leave these people. I command you to disperse to your abodes and trouble us no longer." She stood now and pushed the table back towards the counter top, revealing her triangle on the floor. "I bind you here until you commit to what I ask.  I bind you spirit in the name of Michael. I bind you, and will cast you into the brass pot unless you disperse and trouble us no longer."

She then withdrew a small brass kettle with a lid from her pack and placed it on the table.  Just her body language indicated that this was a severe threat.  She was not someone to be trifled with.  We did not understand it at the time, but it was clear that she knew what she was doing.  This was rather comforting for a time.

"The fire and the pot, or the past Spirit!  The fire and the pot or the past!" Dawnstar repeated this over and over several times.

In that moment the house came alive.  The lights flickered.  The boiler roared.  The floorboards across the home creaked randomly.  Then we saw the door to Lily's room swing violently outward smashing a doorknob sized hole in the wall.  The wind picked up gusting outside, and the shutters banged against the exterior of the house.

"One last time, Aqrabuamelu, The fire and pot, or the past!" She was shouting now over the din.

It was Lily's voice that now shrieked. "You're hurting him!" She ran full speed from the circle into the kitchen as if trying to stop what was happening, distraught of the pain that her Thin-Man was being made to endure. The moment she reached the space where the table had been, the lights went out completely.

For a moment, just for one moment I had seen it.  This hanging light green glow in the kitchen.  It was low to the floor with a tail that reached back and up over it's own mass. Just a glimmer of a shape in the lightest fluorescent mist. And then the lights came back on.  And there was nothing of it left.  There was also no trace of Lily.

Dawnstar put her face into her hands and sobbed. "No, no, no" she whispered through her tears.

"Lily! Lily where are you?" Mrs. Felworth became frantic and started running around the home.

The rest of us looked at each-other dumbfounded with no idea how to proceed.  So we took up the mantle of trying to locate Lily. The house was small and it quickly became clear that she would not be found unless  she answered our calls.  Luckily the front door was the only exit possible so we locked all of the windows and returned to speak with Dawnstar about how to proceed.

Before we could question her I saw it.  There was something strange, a familiar shape at the wall.  It was the hole that the doorknob had made in the wall near Lily's room, there was something there that caught me.  It was an eye.  The green pupil of Lily staring through that hole from the inside of the wall.  And then it was gone.  She had seen me see her and fled.

"She's in the wall!" I shouted quickly. I ran to the corner where I had placed the portable camera on the side table.  I grabbed it and flipped through the menu until I reached infrared, and quickly turned it to the side of the house on which I had seen Lily.

The image was blurred, but well defined.  On the view-screen I saw little Lily's shape, all red against a field of blue, and before her was a tall skinny shape with an upraised tail that towered over his head leading her down the thin corridor between the walls. Everyone gathered behind me examining the screen as we began to follow.  Once we reached the hallway we watched, mouths agape, as the figured climbed upward.

"The attic!" Mr's Felworth said.

She reached up and pulled the string hanging in the hallway, bringing down a collapsible staircase and we cautiously climbed the stairs into the dark attic.  Be the time we got our bearings, and I located the heat signatures in my camera, I found Lily's shape directly above us.  I looked up to find her perched on the rafters above our heads, back hunched, on her hands and knees, as if protecting her stomach from a bully.  We pulled some furniture below her and climbedto her level, carefully pulling her off of the beam that she was curled upon.  

A small shine caught my eye from underneath where she had been.  I could not see well in the dark but felt something smooth with my hand.  I lowered myself down with Lily over one shoulder and a small cold object in my right. We got her downstairs before trying to speak with her and ascertain if she was ok.  She seemed well enough. She was crying and angry that we were going to make her friend go away.  She was very clear about this.  After some assurances and many questions from her mother, Lily agreed to lie down and take a nap on the couch.

I peeled open my hand to reveal the item I had found in the attic. It was a small gem, similar in appearance to amber.  Inside the gem was the body of a scorpion, frozen in time, it's death eternalized by the whims of man. Next to the scorpion seemed to be a very tiny sliver of paper with indiscernible minute scribbling upon it.

"This is it." Dawnstar drew a white cloth bag from her pocket and used it to scoop up the gem from my hand, and cinched the top closed with two white strings. "It will be over now."

We all spoke for some time after that, and then took our leave.  From what I understand the item in question went on quite a journeythe next day.  It was brought to the ocean, it spent some time upon a mountain top.  It was cast into a bonfire.  It's remains were then buried deeply at a crossroads in the wilderness outside of our town.  What I do know is that the moment that object was found and removed, the thing that had been plaguing the Felwroth's and us had stopped.

Lily was sad for some time, but got over it, and returned to her normal self.  The electrical and other issues at the Willow Street house abated.  Thomas, Samantha and I were troubled by no further visits in the night. Dawnstar did not speak openly to us about the experience, preferring to leave it in the past, but clearly she had been successful.

We had done our job. We had done good work.  We had had a real experience. 

And all we could think about was locating the next. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/69c4h1/willow_house_investigation_day_one/)]

Coming home after our first day at the Willow house felt just like that. Coming home.  After some time to think about, perhaps obsess about, our experience at the home I came to a conclusion.  It was the same conclusion that any rational person would land upon after some time and attention.  Our interaction with the Ouija board was simply coincidental.  When you thought about it, it would make perfect sense for my mind to connect a young child with "Sweetness".  Beyond this there was honey on the table that Mrs. Felworth was using in her tea, as well as talk of perfume.  There were many influences that would have triggered my subconscious to pull up the words "Taste Sweet".  The fact that Lily had a condition causing too much glucose in her bloodstream was mere coincidence.  Easily explainable by random chance.  Had I "divined" those words at any home in any situation there would be some similar such correlation. I was sure of it. 

I was embarrassed having let myself slide down the mental slope that so many people do.  I had lost my critical mind and had been a shill as soon as I had had a single strange experience.  I discussed these conclusions with Jason and Samantha who generally agreed with my assessment that this was certainly not proof of anything.  Samantha was a bit resistant but in the end she could not deny that the connection between the words we saw spelled out and the condition that Lily has was more likely coincidence than proof of something more dark or menacing.

Over the following days we reviewed the tape from the recorder, digitized the video interview and reset all of our equipment.  We had already promised to return, though now it seemed like we had maybe jumped the gun on that decision.  Even so, we would return once more and see if we could shine some light on the situation for Mrs. Felworth.  I really did feel for her, she was worried about her daughter, and frankly, I was as well.  It did not seem healthy for a child of six to be so attached to a spirit board.  It did seem like it could become a psychological issue, though I would hesitate to share that opinion with her mother.  This thinking lead me to begin forming a plan.

"So we'll just fake it?" Samatha looked somewhat incredulous as she adjusted her septum piercing.

I assured her it was for the best, and in the best interest of Lily.  She didn't like it but she agreed not to interfere.  I had decided that at our next meeting I would use the board again.  This time I would spell out a prepared set of messages that would inform Lily that Thin-Man had to leave and that we should take the board home with us to keep it safe in case he ever wanted to talk to her in the future.  It was not a complex or well thought out ruse, but you don't necessarily need a high level of skill to fool a six year old. We hoped that without her daughter constantly "speaking to a spirit" that Mrs. Felworth's anxiety would be greatly reduced.

We arrived at the Willow Street home on the 17th, about a week after our first visit and began as we had on the prior visit. There were pleasantries, basic equipment setup and all parties were present at the kitchen table within twenty minutes of our arrival.  Samantha was giving me dark glancing looks as if she was having trouble feeling great about what we were about to do, but she remained quiet.

"Lily, I want to thank you for letting me use your board. It was a very nice talk I had." I smiled and spoke calmly.  "I have a few more questions for your friend though, could I ask him?"

I reached out for the box and Lily did not object.  Honestly she seemed a bit distracted and withdrawn.  I focused on getting the message through to her and reassuring Mrs. Felworth with my eyes as I unpacked the board. Within moments I was circling the planchette again, faster than last time and with a completely clear head.

"Mister Thin-Man, why are you here?" I looked up as I addressed him, as Lily had done .

With complete control and clarity I darted the my hands around the game board to spell out "Lily was sad."

"Is that true Lily?" I asked "I'm sure you've been sad, but you're not sad now, right?"

Lily agreed. I continued my conversation.  I spelled out the whole story.  Thin-Man had come to make Lily feel better, but he should really be at home.  At home he had beautiful things and friends.  He just could not stand to see Lily sad because she was special. The plan went better than expected and withing ten minutes everyone was agreeing, even Lily, that she was fine now and that he could go home.  Lily even made an effort to convince "the spirit" that she wanted him to go and be happy, and that she would be ok.  Thin-Man suggested that the board should go home with our group so that we could dispose of it properly and everything seemed settled as I ended the conversation and pushed the planchette toward the friendly "Goodbye" on the board.

I never saw that word beneath the clear warped plastic.  Before I could reach it all the lights in the house suddenly cut out, leaving us all in utter darkness. Silence reigned as our eyes began to adjust, just starting to make out silhouettes in the dim lights from the street lamps outside. Suddenly out of that darkness came two words.

"You Lied." It was Lily's voice but it held a level of severity that was quite unlike anyone her age and life experience.

I wrenched my head to my left and gasped as I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder. In the sporadic motion I managed to kick the table hard which sent everyone in the room into a frenzy of standing and trying to get their bearings. 

"Thin-Man is angry." Lily stated matter-of-factly at the exact instant that the lights flickered back to life and we were illuminated once again.

"Jesus!" Jason spat as he reached for the back of my shoulder, and pulled my t-shirt down. "You're hurt, lets wash that."

I could not manage to bend my neck enough to see the wound, but I would find out later that I had a rather large set of semi-circles cut into my back.  The highly resembled a bite mark that I had seen when one of my nephews bit his sister.  Unlike that one, mine was rather wide, and the punctures were far more random and misshaped. It was as if the biter had three rows of teeth, each row missing sixty percent of it's inhabitants.  The punctures were scattered at varying depths.

Jason ran to the sink and snatched up some paper towels to run under the faucet.  He stopped dead just staring down for long enough for us all to begin to wonder.

"What is it?" Mrs. Felworth asked concerned, holding a reassuring hand at the back of her daughter.

"The water." He said quietly, almost to himself.  He slowly moved the faucet back and forth a number of times before continuing. 'It's draining counter-clockwise."

"So what?" Mrs. Felworth asked, shocked to be distracted by something so trivial.

"It shouldn't.  We're in the Northern Hemisphere.  It's the Coriolis effect.  Water drains clockwise in the North and counter-clockwise in the Southern hemisphere. This..." he was hypnotized."This is impossible."

Samantha jumped up and grabbed the portable camera, positioning it over the sink to validate the claim.  It was true.  Sam, Jason and I stood transfixed watching the water circle unnaturally around and completely forgot about my minor injury.  Once documented in detail they returned to their task of cleaning my wound and Mrs. Felworth was able to provide a sterile pad to cover it.

Turning back towards to the table my eye caught the spirit board, where the planchette was now resting perfectly over the word "Hello." Only Mrs. Felworth noticed what I was looking at and we shared a dark meaningful stare for several moments.

I asked permission for our group to be excused for some time and the mother said that she would read to Lily until she went to sleep.  She assured us it would likely only be ten minutes or so. We said our goodnight's to the young lady and headed out onto the front porch to converse.

"It hurt you, it affected the real world!" Samantha harped immediately into excitement.  "We have it on tape, that and the water.  We have something here!"

I asked Jason his opinion before offering my own to find that he was also convinced that we were experiencing something unexplainable. I had not choice but to agree.  The silence before my "bite" was complete.  If anyone in the room had gotten up to fake it, it would have been heard clearly.  No one had moved.  No one who we could see in the room anyway.  We additionally discussed the water, Jason having read of such phenomena in a number of famous paranormal cases. And then there was the perfectly timed change in lighting at both the start and end of the incident.  There were too many coincidences, mixed with a fair number of indisputable oddities.  The fear and pain of the injury started to turn into excitement, not quite matching Samantha's.

"We have to be careful. About them." He looked through the window on the porch towards Lily's bedroom.  "We can't be excited in there.  We have to be serious about this.  They could be in danger."

"You're right." I confirmed. "If we all truly think that this is something unexplainable, something other-worldly, they could be in danger.  It would be like having a disease that you don't understand.  We need to find some way to help them, and try not to focus just on gathering more evidence."

We all sat silent, each of us sightly depressed by the fact that any attempt to focus on proving what was happening here could cause danger for this little family.  We knew that our first priority needed to be to stop these occurrences, but could not bury the desire to cause more incidents to occur and then document them.  Even just the material we had collected so far was impressive and likely get our group quite a lot of respect once we edited and added them to our website.

 Once we were all on the same page as far as our conclusions and course of action we re-entered the home to find Mrs' Felworth sitting at the kitchen table smoking a cigarette.  We had not seen her do so on our last visit and she did not typically smell of Tobacco.  Her level of stress became immediately apparent, especially when she rose and began to question us.

"You've been here twice now. What is this. What is going on? Are we safe? How do we get rid of this thing?" Her eyes were red, and cheeks flushed.

"Ma'am, we usually come to cases like this and disprove them.  Many times people misinterpret sounds, smells, and other things as ghost activity and most of our job is finding realistic causes of the phenomenon." I explained sympathetically.

"No! But you got hurt, it hurt you." My calm explanation had apparently done little good . "And the water, the lights..."

"We believe that these are true experiences.  We cannot explain much of what happened tonight and we believe you.  We agree with you. None of us can explain what is happening here rationally." 

"Good." She relaxed a bit and puffed at her Newport. "So what now.  You know it's real, how do we get rid of it?"

"Well. We have some options I suppose.  You could try spending time away from the house, and if that works you could consider moving." I offered.

"I can't just buy and sell houses. I'm not rich, I've sunken every single penny into this place, and between the purchase and her father's funeral costs I have nothing left." She was becoming despondent.

"In that case.  I would suggest that we take a spiritual route.  We fight the spiritual with the spiritual.  We could call in a priest from our parish and he could cleanse the house." I was not able to think of any better plan.  I was embarrassed that my best idea was one inspired by 1970's horror movies.  I had never come across the need to cleanse a house of a force like this.  I had no real advice or ideas.  I only had what I had seen in heard in popular media.  It was the best I could offer.

"A Priest?" rolling her eyes "We're not Christian.  We're not religious and the last thing I want is some Priest in here blaming us for being sinners who don't accept Jesus.  I just... I'll try it but...."

Samantha caught my attention and spoke up. "There's another way. Do you remember my friend Dawnstar?"

I remembered her. She was one of Samantha's more normal friends, at least in appearance.  She looked like a model California beach community resident set against a plethora of goths and punks who typically kept company with Sam. She was spacey though, and could be very strange when she spoke.  She was heavily into practicing meditation, puling tarot cards, laying out crystals and the like.  A bright and sunny person, but how she chose to spend her time made her an outcast.  This is probably what led to her spending time with Sam and her pack of riff-raff.

"What about her?" I asked.  I had not seen her in about a year at this point.

"She's part of a group.  They meet twice a week to..." She glanced at Mrs. Felworth and then back at me. "To practice and experiment with situations like this.  They know what they are doing.  I think that they can clear the house."

"Like Wicca?" Mrs. Felworth perked up and actually seemed a bit excited about this idea.

"Something like that yes, but also different." Sam was addressing the mother now. "I've seen them do things.  Things that assure me that they might know how to fix this."

"When can they come?" She was clearly on-board.

We made plans to return with one or more members of the morbid little club over the next few days.  We parted ways and had yet another heated discussion on the way back.  I couldn't sleep that night.  Every time I turned, my shoulder burned. Each time it burned I had a surge of wonder and excitement that made my heart race.  We had experienced something real and startling this night.  Something beyond anything I had hoped for.  We had proof of something beyond what scientific laws could explain.

***

Update:

The day after this investigation as we organized the captured material and footage, we found something we had not expected. Once we had synced the time codes on our video footage to the audio that we captured on the tape recorder, we found a voice.  A voice that did not belong to anyone in that room.  The moment the lights went out, just before Lily spoke and I was injured, you could clearly hear on the audio tape (but not the video) the words "They Lie! They Lie Lie Lie!" in a dark, thin, shrieking voice.

<TEXT> I agree. Its what I've come to after some rest and a day to ponder it. I think I actually lost a bit of my senses while it was happening. Its interesting to see how most people are misled in their conclusions from their perspective, but we will return with our skepticism intact shortly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, this is why I reacted badly to seeing my hands spell that out.  It felt like I was saying something of the sort in front of her mother.  Of course I would never think like that but it did make me really self-conscious.  As if my subconscious had thoughts like that. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Willow House Investigation - Day One </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-05 04:38:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is an official accounting of the investigation that took place on Willow Street, in October 2016. Members present were myself, Jason Renaud, and my associates Thomas Burgher and Samatha Bennett. Each can substantiate the experiences and offer up noted materials to support the claims made about the case.

I personally took the call from Mrs. Felworth approximately a week ago on October 9th and made some basic notes regarding her experience.  She and her daughter Lily had moved into a new home less than a month previous and reported several classic signs of haunting. Being somewhat familiar with the idea of spirits and general spirituality she decided to call our investigatory group and ask that we visit the home to assess what was happening. She seemed reasonable but slightly flaky on our call.  She was a devotee of meditation, yoga and had some dealings with people who considered themselves modern pagans.  My original impression was one of her wanting to believe that there was something other-worldly happening in her home.  That was until she began to speak about her daughter Lily.

Once the subject of her child came up she expressed nothing but a mortified attitude concerning what they had been through together.  She was clearly worried, and as much as I was sure that there were reasonable explanations for all of the phenomenon she mentioned, I decided that we should visit.  Even if only to allay her fears with twenty of the most common issues that made people believe that their homes were haunted.  We would tour her basement, showing her the knocking pipes.  We would point her toward old or faulty wiring that caused electrical issues.  We would locate the dead rodent that was certainly causing the stench that she mentioned.  This work was satisfying to us. All of us left investigations like this without being let down by the absence of a discovery, but instead happy to have helped a struggling parent.

We arrived at approximately six o'clock once I was able to pick up my friends.  The home was rather unimpressive, worn, but new enough to detract from any sense of history expected in common claims of haunting.  The yard and siding were somewhat unkempt, and the porch boards creaked as we reached it to put down our packs.  

Mrs. Felworth greeted us almost before we could ring the buzzer and ushered us in, helping with our gear.After a short moment of pleasantries I let her know that it was best if we began setting up a small cadre of equipment before speaking and she let us do so.  We did not bring all of our equipment this day, not expecting much, but we did setup a camera in the kitchen where we would interview the mother, and prepared the portable camera as well as our EMF readers and tape recorder for EVP analysis.  We did not expect much, but it was best to have these at minimum for any investigation.

"Is Lily home tonight?" I asked as Tom and Samantha were finalizing the setup.

"Yes, she's playing in her room. Do you want to speak with her?" She sipped her tea.

"Not yet, let's discuss what you've experienced before we bring her out and see if we cannot find some explanations." Tom and Samantha finished up and we all sat at the kitchen table together.  "So we understand that you've been smelling something strange, the lights are flickering and you've been hearing noises at night."

Mrs. Felworth look at me with some small disdain.  "Um, yes, but more than that. They all... they coincide with other things.  It's rarely just one thing."

"They all happen at the same time?"

"No, not necessarily those things but... " She looked to her left to Lily's room before proceeding. "The other night I went to use some perfume, as I was about to go out with a friend.  Lily had a sitter. Anyway, before I could reach the bottle on my side table it fell and smashed. On it's own.  And then there was this horrible smell."

The three of us looked at each other pondering that. Either could be explained quite readily, but certainly the combination of the two made a realistic explanation more difficult.

"That's not all." She seemed like she was desperate for us to understand.  "It fell on carpet. Soft carpet. But he bottle shattered."

I told her that it this was certainly intriguing, though it was certainly possible that the perfume had reacted with the carpet in a way to produce that smell.  It was likely some sort of chemical reaction. She confirmed that she did not have any more of that style of perfume so we could not test the theory. We moved on.

There were more examples like this.  She would feel a hand on her shoulder coming out of the bath and going down the hallway at the exact moment that the lights flickered.  She had seen a shadow cross the east window of the house, while a door slammed on the west wall behind her.  She would lose things only to find them days later wrapped in a tissue, or in the exact place she had thought she had left them days prior.  

"And then there is Lily." She looked down, deeply into her tea cup. "She's been, well, talking to someone. On a spirit board."

At this point Samantha sat upright from her slouch and began paying attention.  Thomas and I kept an extremely healthy skepticism about these sorts of things, but Sam was always the first to be excited about pursuits of this sort.  I don't know if it was part of the goth culture or if she was simply a serious horror fan, but she lit up at the mention of Ouija.

"Does you use it with her? Do you get responses?  What are they like?" Sam asked in quick succession startling the client slightly.

"No, Lily uses the board alone. I've never tried it myself.  But she does get answers.  It scared me so I packed it up and put it on top of the fridge a couple days ago, underneath the counters.  She had it again the next day and... was not herself for a few days.  It scared me so I let her keep it."

I told her that we were interested in speaking to Lily about that with her permission after proceeding to do a sweep of the house.  We toured the small two bedroom home rather efficiently noting any signs of common problems along the way.  We ran the water at each faucet to test for loose pipes that might create noise, or any dark water that might explain a foul odor.  We found no issue there.  We used the EMF reader and did an visual inspection of the wiring.  It was dated, but we could find no signs of gnawed wires or other damage that could explain the lights flickering.  We looked for any sign of infestation, rodent or insect, without result. After a time we returned the the kitchen table with no more information or explanation that we began with, and decided to get Lily to come speak with us.

Thomas greeted her immediately and spent a few minutes describing the things he liked about  her room. He was excellent with children and clearly made her feel comfortable with her new visitors. They were laughing about something in "Minecraft" before the silence fell and Lily turned to everyone and spoke.

"You wanna talk to him now?" Lily turned slightly toward her room.

Silence fell on the room heavily, and at that moment the lights in the kitchen began to flicker.  I shot a look at Thomas and then the camera.  He nodded affirmatively.  We were recording.  

"Talk to who sweetie?" Thomas asked her softly.

"Thin-man. He said you were gonna come talk to him." Her hands were on her hips now, as if she was accusing us of something.

Thomas asked her if he had told her we were coming as I met Mrs. Felworth's eyes.  She slowly shook her head no.  I took this to mean that she had not told Lily who we were and why we were there.

"Sure Lily." I said. "If it is ok with your Mom, let's talk." I spoke slowly but clearly.  

Her mother confirmed and Lily ran happily into her room to get her Ouija board, bringing back to the kitchen table. She slapped it down and unpacked it expertly, as if she had done so many times before.  The board was a standard variety game board that you could purchase anywhere, though it was a bit older and worn around the edges. The moment she had the planchette on the board she placed both of her little hands on it and looked up.

"Mister Thin-man. Hello." She giggled as the planchette wiggled back and forth under her fingers.  "That's how he says Hi now."

"Can you ask him what his name is?" Samantha prodded her.

"Umm.." her hands moved swiftly toward the "no" on the board.  "He doesn't like when you ask that. I just call him Thin-man."

"Can you ask him when he died?" Samantha tried again, giving the impression that she had also done this several times.

She agreed and asked him out loud.  She voiced out each letter as the planchette sped across the board.  "D... I...D...N...O...T. Ha, did not. He didn't die silly."

At this point because there was no possible way we could consider this evidence, I decided to change our tack. There was no way that we could trust that Lily wasn't simply spelling things out as she was only one on the board, and even if it was subconscious, it meant very little towards any kind of proof. In addition to this I was concerned about a child this age getting attached to a spirit board,  and began asking her how often she used it. I also asked her what kinds of things they talked about.  Each question was met with vague answers.  She said she used it once in a while when she wanted to talk, and that they talked about "all sorts of stuff."

All the while her hands were circling the board, around and around.  They began striking and stopping at letters once again, and spelled out the word "hand."

"He wants you to use the board." She looked at me and lifted her hands.

"Me?" I asked, somewhat startled by the request.

"Yep, your turn."  Lily spun the board around so that it was upright for me and sat back.  "Just make circles and see if he says something."

I looked at my partners and Mrs. Felworth before tentatively placing my hands on the planchette.  I was both expecting nothing, and fearing that something would actually happen.  I made a clockwise circle with the planchette, around and around. Everyone was dead silent and I could start to feel the silence like pressure in my ears.  I circled and circled, and felt heavier and heavier pressure on me as I did so.  The silence became oppressive and my head began to droop as if I was hypnotizing myself.  I struggled to cling to this idea as I began to feel somewhat nauseous, telling myself that this was how these things worked.  You get hypnotized running your hands in circles and bring up your subconscious to spell things out. I decided to try anyway.

"What do you like about Lily, Thin-man?" I was trying to keep things simple and natural, just as Thomas had broken the ice by complimenting her room. 

T..A..S..T..E.. the planchette pulled at these letters. It felt like my hands were being dragged along with it, not controlling it.  I tensed up and fought against the impulse, stopping completely.  Feeling that I had broken the illusion, I relaxed a bit.  The moment I relaxed it began again.

S...W...E...E...T

I looked up at Mrs. Felworth feeling shocked and rather embarrassed by what I had spelled out.  I pulled my hands away as if I had been caught doing something heinous.  The only thing worse than my embarrassment was the look in her eyes.  

Mrs. Felworth shot up from her seat. "Ok, thanks for showing us that Lily. You did a great job.  Why don't you go play, it's late and everyone needs to go home soon."

Lily was disappointing but did what she was asked. She made a point to say goodbye to each of us before packing up her board and returning to her room.  The moment her door swung closed, Mrs. Felworth began to leak tears in a steady stream.

I tried to reassure her. "This is perfectly natural.  Lots of kids have imaginary friends, this is just like that.  I don't see anything to worry about, it's just a developmental phase."  I was no psychologist but this seemed both true and comforting.

"You don't get it." She shook her head, tears dripping from her cheeks onto the table.  "This is not imaginary.  You were the only person on the board, and there's no way you could have known."

"Known? Known what?" I was perplexed.

"Lily... she's..." she sniffled. "She is Hyperglycemic.  It means she has very high blood sugar."

Silence fell again as what she was saying sunk in for all three of us.  I was the only one touching the board, and she was right.  I did not know this fact about Lily.  Yet it was my hands, or maybe not, that had spelled out those words about why the Thin-man liked Lily so much.  She tasted sweet.

Having had enough we decided to part company.  We also agreed that we should come back and do some further testing, and further documenting.  At this point I could not come up with any reasonable theory to explain what had just happened.  And an unanswered question like this demanded further work.  It seemed that perhaps something here was amiss.  Something unexplained was happening.  It was everything that the three of us in the group had hoped for, and also the last thing we expected or were prepared to deal with.  We left on good terms and had quite a heated discussion on the long ride home.  We plan to return within the week after we decide on our course of action.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Some nights when the humidity is just right and the skies are clear, the glazed and mirrored cobblestone streets jump at you unawares.  Even after a few drinks, a small pile of pills and two days without sleep they can startle you. Shock you back to lucidity.  That certain flavor of clarity that you can only compare to sobriety, even though it's well beyond the intensity at which anyone sees the waking day. 

They jumped at me that night.  The dull textured curves of each stone seemed to eject themselves from the road toward my windshield.  I had been dreaming, but then I was awake. I can only imagine what it looked like when my boat of a Chrysler skidded twenty feet sideways.  What I do know is that it felt like an eternity on the inside of the behemoth. Regardless of the fact that I was in town and quite far from the ocean, there was still that sinking feeling of flying off into the distance.  Like a tether had been cut and I would hopelessly float through space counting the seconds of slow dreary emptiness.

The world stopped. The sounds ceased. I even sensed the smell of burning tire subside in a matter of seconds.  The buzzing inside my skull remained. There was no noise from the vehicle when I reset and turned the key.  Scanning the streets I found no one out at this hour.  I should not have been out at this hour myself, if I had not heard about a new speak-easy opening on North Willow. It was another place I didn't belong, among the young, naive and hopeful. The rich and carefree.  I had stayed for hours watching them soak up ten dollar drinks and smoke electronic cigarettes. Not a real person among them. No men, no women, just a conglomerate of children who had somehow become important for no particular reason.

I was determined not to let them end me.  Half of them had refused even to acknowledge me at the bar, while the others had bought me drinks with scorching pity in their eyes.  It was enough. I would not let their little hipster enclave end me like this.

I left the car, just like my father had taught me before the end.  I can still feel his hand on my shoulder and his ice blue eyes boring into mine the day he handed over my first set of keys.

"Wear your belt. Don't speed in your own neighborhood." Father had obviously had a list for me. "And if you've had some drinks and fuck up, just walk away.  They can't give you a breathalyzer if you're not there."

The man was not a great parent, but tried to do me a service.  That's how he was.  Always ready to offer a hard piece of advice from his own experience.  Always ready to try to keep you out of the cesspool that his life had become.  Always ready to accept the worst in you, and teach you how to live with it properly.

I took his advice and decided to try to find somewhere to sleep it off.  By the time the morning came I would sort out what to tell the police.  By that time I would be cleaned up and presentable.  I decided that I could even pass it off like I had gotten a concussion.

Elm, Franklin, Maple, Grove and Cross streets. I spun in a circle trying to get my bearings and remember motels in the area.

Wait. Cross? Cross Street?  I stared at the sign building a mental image of the town.  I turned and verified the many landmarks I recognized.  The Laundromat, the Dunkin Donuts, and the package store were all within spitting distance.  But then there was also Cross Street, between Maple and Grove, standing out like a void of understanding, like a dark gap in my internal compass.

I stumbled forward peering down the dark street.  It appeared entirely residential, with no storefronts, hell it didn't even seem to have street lights. I told myself that I must not know the street since there seemed to be little of interest on it, until I saw the small illuminated sign in the distance.  I covered my eyes, blocking out no light whatsoever as I squinted enough to make out the letters "B B".  The building sat at the very end of the street where it seemed to dead end.  The porch was lit gloomily in a dark red color.  It was the only color or light on this street and I could think of no other housing in this area.  I began to walk.

This walk also seemed to go on forever, looking left and right and taking step after step that seemed to get me no closer to my goal.  More and more I could make out the deteriorating cedar shingled exteriors of the homes on either side, if you could call them homes.  Some were entirely crumbling, others offered vast pools of standing water around the foundations.  Front doors hung at wide angles and shutters were disturbed and creaked in the slight breeze.  The smell of decaying plant matter began to overtake my senses.

I stopped looking to my sides and focused instead on the growing red glow of the porch light ahead of me. I walked and walked.  Assaulted by the growing stench of putridity, and starting to feel woozy again now that the adrenaline had surpassed. My legs began to fail me and it was all I could do to focus on my goal and get there before I was sick or lost consciousness.

I made it to the steps before dropping and vomiting violently over myself and the wooded steps at my feet.  My eyes bulged and burned as my consciousness seemed to be projected forward in the tumult of bile and whiskey spewing from me.  I raised my head gasping for breath once the sickness subsided. That is when I saw him.

My father.

Dead for twenty years.  He was standing on the porch looking down on me shaking his head.  I could recognize the particular pattern of oil stains on his coveralls. I could smell the rolled tobacco and gin all around him. He reached a hand down to me and his eyes burned with a strange light as he addressed me.

"I hoped you wouldn't join me."

Like the reflection on wet cobblestone, those eyes startled me out of my state.  I was running before I could even recognize the decision to do so.  The adrenaline was back and it carried me for what felt like miles.  My heart raced. Sweat poured from my body.  And still my legs pumped like a machine, until my foot caught something in the street and everything went dark.  Not as dark as Cross Street, but empty.

It was days later, when I awoke in the hospital that I learned about my discovery.  I was told by the officers attending to the door of my room that I was found spread out and unconscious on the hood of my car.  Apparently, while running back towards it, I had tripped over the tangle of bike in the street.  The bike's woner was ten feet behind my car, a limp, lifeless, broken little bearded man who I understand was named James.

Even today, years later I can appreciate this one thing about that night.  Prison is heaven, having managed to escape Cross Street. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Unexplained Incident in New Haven </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-10 00:06:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Greetings everyone.  My name is Dwayne.  I'm a state trooper out of New Haven Connecticut.  I've been on the force for almost 20 years and a few months back something strange happened that I've not been able to shake.  I've always been a bit of a drinker but ever since that night things have been bad.  I've been irritable, out of sorts and frankly drinking through each day.  I'm hoping that maybe sharing this with someone will help.  I can only imagine what my ex would say, so I'm turning towards the anonymous internet instead.

It was a fair day and I was cruising down 95 heading back to the station when I got the call.  "Young woman causing a scene crossing interstate 95." This was the entirety of the report. I called in to get the mile marker and found that I was relatively close.  I had been in a hurry to get off of work that day to see my daughter, but frankly the idea of seeing her mother was enough to encourage my to respond. I called in that I was on my way and headed toward the reported scene.  

This internet age is crazy.  Before I even reached the location I was watching a Youtube video of a young girl running and spinning in circles in the middle of the highway.  Sammy at dispatch had texted the link partially so I would know what was happening, but mostly because Sammy was a bored busy-body who loved gossip and glamorization.  Regardless, by the time I reached the scene I immediately recognized her.  She was hard to miss.  She was half naked, with the rags of a white camisole as her only protection against the elements.  She was crouched with her shoulder pressed alongside the concrete barrier and frantically peeking over, and then ducking back down.

I positioned my car to protect her from the flow of traffic and called in my position.  I carefully got out of the car, and approached her a gently as I could.  I had spent years dealing with domestic disputes, which more often than not, included some paranoid, drug addled husband.  The state of this woman looked very familiar, and I knew not to provoke someone as high as she must have been.

She saw me coming from long off and locked eyes with mine as I, step by step, got closer.  I held my hands low, palms down, showing that I was not a threat.  I was good at this and it worked.  She let me get within speaking distance without becoming startled, though her eyes were wild and full of trepidation.

"Sweetheart, I'm here to help you."

She ignore me, instead popping her head up and looking over the barrier to the opposite side of the highway.  I looked and saw nothing.

"You're in danger, young lady"

She spun her head to eyeball me intensely.

"Yes!" she whispered forcefully.

"Ok. Let me help you.  Get into the car and we'll leave."

I walked towards the car, looking over my shoulder to see her positioning and preparing to follow me like a cat.  The moment my door was open she darted from her position and was in the back seat of my cruiser faster than I would have imagined possible.

I pulled away and headed back to the station, all the while looking at her in my rear view.  She was cut, bruised, scraped and clearly not well.  She kept darting from one window to another looking for something.

"You're going to be ok now.  Can you tell me what happened?"

"They're coming."  She was distracted, still on the lookout.

"Did someone hurt you?  Are they here?" I slowed the car a bit in case the perp was in the local vicinity.  She did not answer, yet her answer was clear.  She was obviously worried about being found by  the people who hurt her.  I called into dispatch telling them that I had secured the girl, and that I was on my way back now.

She completely flipped out.  She started kicking the seat behind me, spinning her body and screaming.

"No! No!  They'll hear! They'll find us!" tears were streaming down her cheeks.

"Shh. It's ok. You're safe with me.  They won't be able to hurt you.  Do they have a police scanner? Is that what you mean?"  I was now starting to realize that this girl might not be crazy or drugged.  Her eyes were clear, and although highly disturbed, she did not seem to have the classic signs of a tweaker.

"They will hear." She lowered her voice, looking into my eyes in the mirror.

"Ok. Ok. No more radio.  We'll get you back to the station."

She calmed a bit and fumbled with her hands between her knees.  We only had a few minutes left until we reached the station and the detectives would take over.  My curiosity got the better of me and I continued to ask questions.  I knew that this was perhaps my only chance to actually figure out what was happening, and frankly the idea of tracking down the scum that hurt this young girl was exciting.

"Who did this.  Do you know where they are?"

"Elsewhere.  They took me.  They took me long ago and.... it's different. That place. They found me, and they're looking again.... to take me back, to take me." She was slow and despondent now.

"What does it look like, the place?  

"It's... It's bad, and purple.  It comes in waves but they hurt.  They pull at you, tearing. And the flashes, they... they pull too... but... your brain, your eyes."

This was getting nowhere fast.  I decided that I was not likely to get any legitimate information at this point and stopped.  My silence was interrupted by her fresh screams.  She held her temples with the palms of her hands, fingers extended, shouting "They're here now, they found me!"

Over her deranged shouting I heard the break of my radio, and answered it.  

"Car 19, this is dispatch, what's you're location?"

This was so routine as to be automatic for me. I looked out the drivers side window to check and replied instantly.

"Mile marker 36."  Then something stuck me. "Sammy?"

Silence.

"Sammy, that you?". I got nothing in return. "Hello?"

Silence.

And then it was too silent.  I looked in my rear view to nothing but an empty seat.  I jammed my breaks and pulled to the breakdown lane,  and ran out of the car.  I checked the back thoroughly to find nothing. No one.  She was just.... gone. There was no sign she'd ever even been there.

I came back to the station empty handed.  I was questioned about what was going on.  I told them the truth.  I told them every single part of what I'm telling you.  What I got in return was a 3 week leave, and to never be looked at without concern since.  I still have my career, but no one on the force treats me the same.  I don't treat myself the same.  I learned on that day that there was something enormous and unexplained among us.  I was no threat to it, probably not even a consideration compared to that.  But "that" exists.  My reality is theirs.  They are here, and there is nothing I can do about it.

I just pray that they never want me. </TEXT>

I awoke screaming.  The memories of that day flooded me immediately and I thrashed, my vocal chords screaming in pain.  Then I realized there was no pain. I turned my head to the left to examine my wound to find something that shocked me out of my immediate reaction.  There was no wound. No missing finger. There was however blood, dark and crusty on my hand and smeared down the side of the bed to the floor.  I gripped my hand, waggled my fingers and stared in astonishment to see that I was whole.  

"You're ok." Erica whispered from the bedside at my feet.

I raised my head as high as I could to see her, sitting in a small folding chair, hands folded in her lap.  The skin around her eyes were red and she looked like she had not slept for some time.  The sides of her mouth twisted as she struggled to meet my eyes with hers.

"Erica, let me out.  Get me out of here!" My voice sounded like an old jazz singer who smoked two packs a day.

She looked down at her feet, and remained silent.

"Let me out!" I managed a hoarse yell.

"Shhh. They'll hear you. Please, please be quiet." she pleaded.  "I'm so sorry.  You don't understand.  I'll explain everything. Just keep it down before they hear us."

She cautiously put her hand on my leg.  Her head darted to the right, and then to the left.  I saw her nostrils flare as she inhaled in each direction, and held the silence for several moments.  After a minute she relaxed and removed her hand and lowered her head into her palms.

"This was the only way." Tears streamed down her cheeks.  "The only way you could survive.  They were going to kill you, because.... because of me."  She wept openly now.  Though I was overcome with anxiety I still found myself able to give her time to process.

"I knew that they would never let me be with an outsider.  I just... I thought that if I was careful, they would not find out.  I needed to be in the world, to be part of something normal.  To get away and have something of my own, something normal." Her words were rapid and desperate. "I needed that.  I'm sorry, I should have known. I can never have that, and now...."

"Now what? what are they going to do to me?"

"They won't kill you.  They can't kill you now."

I was overcome with frustration at this answer.  I'd had enough of being in the dark.  I instinctively raised my fists until the chains stopped the motion and raised my head.

"Tell me! Tell me what's going on! You owe me that!" My guttural voice shocked me.

"You're one of us now.  You're a Lycanthrope.  I did this, I made you this.  I'm so sorry but it was my only choice.  The only way to save you from elimination.  They would have killed you without blinking an eye. But now they can't.  We don't kill our own kind, and now you are one of us."

I let this sink in.  I had known it already. I had subconsciously understood what was happening.  Having someone actually say it outright helped me to accept the facts, though it still took me some time and effort to accept the obvious.

"So I'm... I'm a werewolf now? And your friends there cannot kill me?  So what now.  Are they planning on keeping me chained as some kind of pet?"

"The council has been discussing you for hours.  The local chancellor of the Order is on his way to partake in the decision making.  My assumption is that they are going to stay very close to you as things develop until they can trust you.  I assume that your training will begin as per normal once they are finished."

"What do you mean by my training?  What is the Order?  What do you people do?"  The more information I received led only to more questions.

"Listen, I don't have much time.  I am expected at the council shortly to receive their ruling, so I'll try to answer quickly.  We work for the Order. You could say that we are the military branch.  We're their right hand acting as mercenaries and are allowed to continue to exist in return.  It is very rare that we can reproduce, which makes you very special.  Only one in a hundred manage to survive the trauma I put upon you and survive... and turn.  That's why our prime directive is to never destroy our own kind.  Our line is too precious, too rare and the Order insists that we consistently grow our numbers.  You will be trained in how to fight.  How to turn. And use your senses to accomplish the Order's goals.  How to retain your purpose through the transformation.  You will be trained to be one of us, until they feel you can be trusted, and then you will be their soldier, and our brother."

I listened intently, taking it all in.  Before I could ask another question, Erica stood and told me that she must leave.  That the council would be back in session until the morning, and that I should get some rest for tomorrow.  She clearly rejected any further conversation, apologized again and left swiftly.  She left me in that dank empty room.  Chained, overwhelmed, and in complete despair.

My mind raced, going over everything she had said.  Remembering the torture and it's lack of lasting impact.  Remembering those men, those "brothers".  What they looked like, how they acted.  They were animals in the bodies of men, dispensing pain like hapless goons.  I smelled the filthy, hairy, sweaty truth around me.  And I knew.  I knew that I could never be a part of this.  I focused on planning my escape.

The memory of this night is still painful for me.  The desperation, the pain, the blood, and the madness that took over my being is beyond my comprehension.  The plan was fast and dirty, and the action began before I could even consider any other option.  I began tearing at the mattress with my finger nails.  It was probably thirty minutes before I made any real progress, and in that process I had damaged my right hand quite badly.  I tore two nails completely off of my fingers by the time I managed to get through the outer material, and both my hands and the mattress were thick with blood.  

Knowing that I would heal was of no comfort to the pain of the moment, but I continued frantically.  My fingertips could now grasp the metal springs inside the mattress and I rapidly pulled and pushed them back and forth trying to generate friction.  This process took another agonizing thirty minutes, but I did finally managed to dislodge a four inch piece of steel spring.  This was likely only possible due to the advanced age, and rusting wear on the metal.

I pressed the end of the coil against the metal bed frame to straighten enough of it to suit my purposes. Once I had this tool I set to work on the locks that held the chains together around my left wrist.  I began to worry that even if the council was tied up all night I might never succeed.  There was no turning back.  Someone would surely see what I had done, had I tried to hide the tool for another time, so I persevered.  After an hour I gasped as I heard the "pop" of the master lock opening on my left cuff.  I set to work on my feet and right hand.  These went much more quickly now that I had a feel for the methodology, and soon I was free of my bonds.

And like that, I was up.  I sped around the room, checking the door, examining the walls, and then searching through the large trunk in the corner.  I found a machete and tucked it into my belt against my back.  After examining my inventory and surroundings I decided on my best course of action.  There was no way that I was getting through the door, so I turned my sites on the wall.  I located a position in the west wall that was clearly above ground. I could see where there had been a basement window there previously.  I also hoped that this now patched portion of concrete might be less stable than the rest.

I was relieved to find that the battery-pack-powered saws-all that I had found in the trunk was charged and functional.  I readied myself for the noise it would make.  I knew that it might bring my "brothers" and prepared myself for needing to fight if they came through the door.  After ensuring that the machete was easily drawn, I began pressing the running saw into the creases in the concrete.  I was about eighty percent through tracing a body sized square when the blade broke.  I cursed, and ran back to the trunk to retrieve the small sledge hammer, and began smashing at the center of my framed outline.  In a ten minute fury of smoky, pounding and rubble I could soon see the woods and had enough room to escape.  

Even though I had moved the trunk to this wall in order to lift myself through the hole, I still tore my chest and stomach badly as I dragged my body though the tight space.  The concrete ripping at my skin was excruciating but I knew that time was of the essence.

And then I was free.  Bloody, torn, bleeding profusely, and free.

I tore through the woods toward the nearest road.  I did not make it far before my body began to make it very clear that it was finished.  I imagine that it head been at least twelve hours since I had eaten, or had any water. I had lost a lot of blood and overexerted myself for hours straight during my escape.  The falling stars beginning to overtake my vision convinced me that I had very little time left.

I ran in circles, moving outward to locate somewhere to hide. To find some salvation of any kind that might ensure that I could not be tracked or found.  What I did find at the last possible moment was the driveway to the complex, in which sat one single car.  It was a polished, pitch black Jaguar. And to my relief it was empty.

I found the car unlocked, and quickly checked for keys as my legs began to give out on me.  No such luck.  I did the only thing I could in the last few moments of consciousness.  I got into the trunk and pressed my body as far back as possible after closing the lid tight.

And once again, darkness took over.

[[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5i8ujt/i_met_someone_wrong_on_okcupid_part_3/)]

I apologize for the delay in updating.  If you understood what has been going on, which you will soon, I'm sure you will understand.  I am currently at a library in New Jersey, and frankly not very happy about being back in the exact same spot that I was in when I last wrote. Let me try to catch you all up.  I'm hoping that some of you may have some advice for me.  The comments last time were helpful in thinking about different ways I could proceed, though frankly the outcome has not been very successful.  It may take me a couple posts to cover everything that's happened since last I posted though.

Several people mentioned that I had no idea what I was up against with "The Order" in it's size, scope and reach.  Once I settled and recovered from my sister's death I realized that this was true.  I realized that this notion of going in, guns blazing for revenge, was a completely illogical and suicidal maneuver. I also took into account much of the advice given regarding how to mask my scent and perhaps deter the pack from locating me.

In the end I decided that information gathering should be my first goal, and that I needed to proceed cautiously.  I cashed out the debit card that I had and bought some supplies at a local hunting store.  I bought and adorned a set of "Scent-a-way" hunting clothes, applied some apple cider vinegar to my boots and around my body, and stole off into the night towards Erica's house.  This seemed the only move I had to get more information about what I was facing.  Knowing where she lived was the only lead.

I parked my rental about a half a mile away, behind a small church at about 10 pm and begin to hike up the hill to her home.  I was careful not to approach it directly, but to cut a circuitous path around the back of her house. When I got within a decent viewing distance I stopped behind cover and watched the house. I was astounded at my luck.  Only minutes after I arrived at this position I saw her exit the back door and walk into the woods.  Keeping a safe distance I slowly and quietly trailed her through the thicket.  She eventually reached a large patch of bamboo growing alongside a small cliff and began chapping at stalks using the machete she had brought with her.

This was my chance.  My chance to speak to her alone and find out what was really going on. I slowly began to approach with my hand gripping the 9mm in my jacket pocket.  She stopped dead and spun around as soon as I was a thirty feet behind her.  

"Erica, it's David." I said quietly, trying to ensure that I did not startle her.

"David! What the fuck are you doing here, are you crazy?" she dropped the machete and ran towards me. "You can't be here! You need to leave now!"

She gripped my shoulders hard. I could feel her nails digging in, even with the thick hunting jacket between us. She lowered herself looking pleadingly up and into my eyes while she began to repeatedly whisper the word "no" and close her eyes.  In a moment I noticed why. Over her shoulders I could see several yellow reflective eyes in the thicket behind her.  There were at least five but I instantly assumed that there were just as many at my sides and behind me. They were all moving, bobbing left and right, and getting closer fast.

"Fuck!" I shouted starting to turn to attempt to flee.

She held me hard, it was almost as if there was no possible way I could turn my body as she looked at me deeply in the eyes, and whispered "I'm sorry."

The searing pain made me scream for only seconds until my vocal cords tore at which point there was only silence, and my vision was filled with crimson.  Erica, in a split second, had drawn her arm back and slashed my chest.  I saw no weapon in her hand but the instant agony I felt made it clear that she had harmed me greatly.

There was the pain. There was the red overtaking my vision.  And then the red turned to black.

***

I awoke.

The first thing I recall as I awoke was the searing white light burning my eyes.  The pain in my head was splitting, but dissipated quickly and I was soon able to get a feel for my surroundings.  I tried to sit up to no avail, finding that each of my limbs were restrained.  My wrists and ankles were wrapped in thick leather cuffs, each wrapped through large eyelets with heavy chains.  I was strapped down onto a dirty mattress and metal bed frame that looked like it had been stolen from an abandoned prison.  I looked down at my bare chest to where I had remembered being hit or stabbed but there was no obvious injury. I quickly concluded that perhaps I had been injected with something.  That could explain both the pain and the quick loss of consciousness. The room around me was almost entirely empty.  Just bare concrete walls, sections stained in a variety of colors and patterns that made my head spin. 

There was one door in the room.  It was a large steel freezer door with the handle removed.  The only other item in the room was one old rotting trunk in the corner.  I did not like this look of this.  The single light above my head swayed very slightly back and forth, making the shadows of that box waver slightly, drawing my gaze toward it again and again.

I thought about screaming and quickly decided that it was in my best interest to take some time to think.  Even if it's only affect was to delay what was coming.  I focused on perceiving anything I possibly could about what was going on around me.

Now that my eyes had adjusted to the light I started to notice that there was something strange about the room.  As dirty as it was, and even though the lighting was not very bright it had a strange feeling to it.  It was very crisp, like everything here had been meticulously outlined.  I began to listen closely and I could hear footsteps and muffled speech. The steps did not sound as though they were being made on the flooring though, they had this soft low impact.  They sounded like someone in heavy boots stomping on the ground.  My hopes were raised slightly thinking that clearly this room was near an exterior wall, and that it must be a very thin one for me to hear the men outside.  Perhaps if I managed to escape my bonds I could use the metal bed frame to get through the cinder block over time.

My attention followed the sounds of the people outside. I felt like there were three of them.  They smelled quite strongly, their mildew-like scent assaulting my nose and I traced their movement across the wall in front of me.  I could feel their presence.  The sound and the smell all accumulated into this almost vision-like sensation of their forms playing in patterns on the wall.

Something was wrong with me.  My pulse quickened and I began to hyperventilate.  Something was really wrong.  My only thought was of change.  I needed to be up.  I needed to get a hold of myself. Just sit up and put my face in my palms, or my hands on my pounding heart.  I twisted and turned, pulling, almost turning the bed over with my thrashing.

"He's up." I heard very clearly from the corner of the room.  The voice was coming from outside, but I could then feel them moving.  Then a door opening, then steps, then the door next to me unlatching.

The three men that entered were dirty, smelly and intense.  They each looked like they had been Hell's Angel's in a past life, and then had taken up hunting and camping for a year straight.  There was no "Order" to these men.  They were like animals.  Clothes torn. Stains everywhere. Each a patchwork of leather, denim, camouflage and grease.

The darker man moved to the corner, squatted and opened a can of dip, pressing some between his gums and dark teeth.

"Wayll Eddie, herie is." One of the still standing men said to the other, while the squatting man remained silent in the corner. "Watchya think then?"

"Jaysus, really?  For this scrawny fuck?" The other standing man replied.

He moved toward me, and I tried my damnedest to sink my body back into the bed away from the approaching man.  He was big, about six foot two, wide shouldered and muscular. He bent over me closely, putting his face inches from my own. His smell and his greasy pock-marked skin began to make me nauseated to the point of heaving.  He then drew in a long nasal breath moving his head down from my face to my chest.

I started to retch. He stood straight, drew back his arm and slammed it with all his force into my stomach, pinned on the hard mattress.  My body tried to curl up and protect my core, but was prevented by my restraints.  I cannot even explain the pain, the fear of not being able to breath, the sheer primal instinct that took over to protect myself.  The two men laughed and pushed at each other as they watched my pain.

"Ain't much to lookat, but hay, maybe he got something special inside, Dane." Eddie said back, answering Dane's question. 

They both laughed repeating "Yeah something special on the inside..." as they walked over to the box in the corner and began rooting around in what sounded like a pile of tools.

"Aight, let's see" Dane said now coming back at me with something in his hand.  "Maybe issin his foots?"

He bent over my legs, and pulled off my sock.  The pain from the gut punch just starting to subside, I raised my head as best I could to look.  He had a pair of rusty garden shears in his hand and pressed them against the bottom of my left foot. I pleaded. It was all I could do, as tears started to stream down my face.

"She ain't no foot girl Eddie. Maybe she likes somethin' else? Ya think?"

"Oh, yeah maybe that's it!" Eddie pulled at my belt and put the shears hard against my crotch. 

I screamed. I yelled for help. I twisted, swore, spat, and leaked frothy spittle and tears.

"Naw, I think HE likes that more than she does." Eddie stood straight removing the shears as I quieted down into a whimper. "Awww... she must love those though.  Lookat those lily white hands.  There ain't an ounce a' work on those.  Ain't they just lovely Dane?"

"Yays they is!  I wish I had dem lovely fingers a' his. Like a baby's."

"A'right you can have one." Within seconds Eddie had the pinkie finger of my left hand between the blades of those rusted shears, and a second later the pain once again overwhelmed my consciousness. 

As I began to black out I remember seeing Eddie throw something to Dane as they danced and laughed.  They were making a game of tossing my finger back and forth as they circled they room like monkeys.

They man in the corner stood up slowly looking right into my eyes.

"Not much to look at, true.  But he is one lucky fuck." These were his first and only words this day.

Then once again, blackness took over.

[[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5i1n3o/i_met_someone_wrong_on_okcupid_part_2/)]

I have to say, I read many of the comments on my previous posts and scoffed.  It seemed at the time that some of the people on this forum were as, if not more, disturbed as Erica was.  I know better now.  You were trying to warn me of something that you understood and I did not.  Hindsight is always twenty-twenty. I want to humbly thank the people who posted the more extreme warnings. You tried to help, and it fell on deaf ears.  I'm currently sitting in a Starbucks in Southern New Jersey, face dirty and teared as I wish, more than anything, that I had listened to you.

I know that it's important to stop for a few hours and post this.  It may very well be the only chance of ensuring that a record of these events can survive. I don't expect any of you to put yourselves into any danger for me, but if i do disappear perhaps this will serve to convince someone that there is something bigger happening here.

After the fire filing of the police report, a representative from my home insurance company met met.  He gave me a prepaid debit card, since I had lost my wallet, with an advance on the future claim.  This turns out to be standard procedure after a house fire and was immensely helpful as I processed the shock of my ordeal.  At first I felt fine.  An hour after I checked into the sparse hotel room I began to not feel so well.  I spent hours vomiting and coping with the sudden onset of emotion now free to flow, now that the ordeal was over.

I had no home. I had almost been killed.  My carefully constructed life was falling apart around me and I had no power in the situation.  All I had was myself and that was crumbling, unable to recover from the trauma.  I won't call it a breakdown, but I had a very difficult night, with little sleep and no comfort.  In the darkest hour I did something I have not done in a number of years.  I called my sister, Evie. 

I love me sister, and she loves me.  That said, we were always extreme opposites and it always made out time together explosive.  While I secured a solid job at an insurance company, she traveled freeloading off of random strangers.  In college when I drank too much, she tried to convince me that alcohol was poison and that I should smoke more marijuana instead.  When I hosted Thanksgiving one year she was suddenly vegan.  You get the picture.

She is always there for me though.  And I have always done my best to do the same for her when she was in need.  I think that she had been in need much more often than me, but that is neither here nor there.  Upon receiving my call and hearing my voice along with some basic details about the fire, she insisted that I get up to her house as quickly as possible.

By yesterday at 10am I was there, pushing aside a multitude of wind chimes to enter her quirky little cabin.  She embraced me until I felt extremely uncomfortable, and  then kept going for another few minutes.  Over a pot of tea that she had actually cultivated herself, I told her the same story I told the police, including all the detail I could remember.  She sat, sipping her tea, and kept her eyes wide, drinking in everything I told her for an hour straight without saying a word.

"Draw it." She said at the end.

"Draw what?"  I was pretty sure that she was trying to induct me into some weird art therapy or something by having me creatively express the events.

"The symbol on your door, draw it for me."

I grabbed a pen from her counter and did as she asked.  

She stared at my drawing and immediately said a word that I recognized from some of the redditor's posts.  

"Thurisaz... I..." she jumped from her seat and left the room.

After a few moments of stunned silence I slowly followed to find her in a small room filled with disorganized stacks of books. This is just like her, I thought.  All ofher money spent of hundreds of off-the-wall books and nothing left to buy a bookshelf. She flipped through and flung three books in the corner before finding what she had been looking for.

"Ok, here it is.  I was right" she moved her finger across the lines of text in the book she was holding.  "This is one of two things, David.  Some interpretations consider this a protective rune, and other interpretations consider it to be a Thorn and describe it as a mark of coming destruction."

"Ok, so it is a mark of something?  It means something in particular?"

"[muttering].... catch up already. What was in it? You said something was in it."

"Oh some plant. The whole symbol was stuffed with this plant."

"What did it look like?"

I described it as best as I could, telling her it had small leaves, tall stalks and little purple flowers.  She seemed to come to a realization, and again began tearing apart her book stacks like a banshee.

"This?  Like this?" she held color photos of the plant I had removed from my door much too close to my face.

"Yes, I think that's it.  What is this about?  What are you thinking?"

She rose and took my hand in hers, holding it warmly.  She lead me back to her kitchen and refilled out tea.  This mysterious act was starting to piss me off, but I let her retain the drama.  Trying to get her to not be dramatic usually made it worse.

"You need to call that girl.  She was trying to protect you" She said matter-of-factly.

"It's some protection symbol then?  Protect me from what?"

"Just... there's something after you David, she was trying to stop it."

"What is it?" I asked, getting more miffed by the second.

We stared at each other for what seemed like minutes before Evie lowered her head.

"The herb that was inside, and charging the protection symbol, was Wolfsbane.  Wolfsbane is only used to protect someone against one thing."

I sat quietly looking at her, until it hit me.

"Oh come on." I stood up quickly. This was too much, and I needed sanity at the moment, not more madness to deal with.

"You had a protection rune on your door, David.  It was stuffed with wolfsbane.  And you said yourself, you heard dogs but there was no sign of them on the camera footage." She was being cautious, I could tell.  She was not saying it outright but trying to lead me to the conclusion that she had clearly made.

Thinking about that rough panting noise did strike a cord.  I was not one to ever possibly consider such an outlandish notion, but there were some congruent facts here. I decided to consider it for a moment and give the idea a fair shaken knowing that in five minutes I could at least say that I had considered it after I blew it off as laughable.

"Ok so basically, you think that Erica came and tried to protective me from werewolves.  That the noise I heard was just that.  That I'm being hunted by, what, a pack I guess?"

"Do you have a theory that fits better?" she had this little smirk as she sipped at her cup.  "Why don't you call and ask her?"

I remembered at that moment that I had in fact picked up a disposable cell phone on the way here to call Erica.  Again, I must thank those who posted this advice.  Calling from a landline was certainly not a good solution.

I called Erica, and I got her on the phone immediately.  I told her who it was and asked her what was going on.  I was in a rush and got right to the point.  She took the bait and made it clear that she had knowledge of what was happening.

"Fuck David, what happened? are you safe?" she was whispering harshly. "How did they get past the door?"

I told her that I had replaced the door, and that they had burned my house down.  I asked who were they were and how I could make this all stop.  I begged her to help me.

"You need to go now.  The Order, they're coming. They will find you, your not safe, hide now.  They're different David, they can smell you, they will find you no matter..."

Then there was silence.  I was shocked back to reality by the busy signal now ringing in my ear.  Repeated attempts to call her back yielded no results.

"So, they can smell you?" Evie had that little smirk on again.  She had obviously heard Erica's side of the conversation.

She beckoned me to follow her as she opened her cabinets and started handing me several containers of salt. She hurried me to her front yard and started pouring a thick stream of it on her front walkway drawing it slowly and meticulously around the house.

"Evie, what are we doing?"

She told me that she thought that this might protect us.  In no uncertain terms she made it clear that we could talk after we drew a complete circle around her house.  Once that was done Evie told me that she was not positive that the salt would stop the things that were after me, and that she needed to do more.  She shot down my complaints and attempts to bring her back to reality.  

I can't even cope with writing this right now, so I'll just give you the facts.  She told me that there was a patch of wolfsbane in the woods just outside her house and needed to get it.  She asked me to collect branches while she was harvesting the herb so that we could fashion another protection symbol.  The woods were bright that night,  with the clear skies and bright moon, which made it very easy to accomplish our work.

Just as both of us rose from collecting, her with a basket of wolfsbane and me with a bundle of branches under my arms, we heard it.  We heard the howling.  The penetrating low tone of wolves around us.  We could hear them in the South and the East coming from the deeper forest.  We could hear them even closer in the West and North near to her home.

I can still see her eyes.  Lit by the moon and weeping slightly, locked onto mine as her torso was unnaturally pushed sideways, and her body followed.  The enormous bundle of ears, paws and teeth had come flying from nowhere, leapt and carried her several feet without a sound.

I left her.  I fucking just ran.  I didn't even look back.  I even felt relief as two more wolves shot past me toward her location.  I'm sorry Evie.  I'm so sorry.

I've got nothing left.  No family. No home. Nowhere to go. No one to help me. Not only that but I am now a person of interest in my sisters death because I fled the scene.  I have no choice but to try to disappear and I can only imagine what it looks like to the police investigating her murder.

So I'm sitting here in a random Starbucks. I'm hunted by police.  I'm hunted by wolves.  I'm haunted by the knowledge that I killed the only person that I really loved. I have nothing left to protect. I'm cornered, and I have only one move.  To find The Order and stop this, or at least avenge poor Evie.  I'd like to say that my pain has lead me to gear up, get angry, and fueled me to bring the fight to them.  But I don't feel that way.  I just feel like my only option, is likely suicidal.  But I have no choice.

I'm getting back on the road now.  I've withdrawn the cash from my debit card, and have an Uber coming to drive my further north.  I plan to find a safe location, attempt to finally act on the information that I now have regarding protection, and locate the Order.  I will update you as soon as I can.

<TITLE> I Met Someone *Wrong* on OkCupid [Part 2] </TITLE>

<TEXT> [[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5hug40/i_met_someone_wrong_on_okcupid/)]

Today I took action. I decided that most of the people who were generous enough to comment were probably right and I needed to protect myself.  I drove to a couple of stores and bought myself a new door, a 9mm hand gun, and a security camera system.  I ended up skipping work to to install the door and one of the cameras at the entrance to my house.  Replacing the door was a terrible pain, but once that was done, the camera / DVR install went pretty smoothly.  I even managed to get to the shooting range before it closed so that I could  get used to the new firearm.  I'm not a huge gun fanatic, but I have shot a handful of times so I became pretty comfortable with the weapon quickly.

By the time I got home I was really exhausted.  Frankly I was happy for that, knowing that I was nervous enough to suffer some serious insomnia.  I hoped that wearing myself down with all this activity would help me to sleep. The new camera / DVR system had a phone and tablet interface and I was able to lie in bed and set it to record on movement only, as well as send a notification to my ipad.  I made sure the volume was up and left the tablet at my bedside table.  I put the gun in the drawer of my side table next to the bed, sipped a glass of whiskey and turned in.  I was right, I fell dead asleep almost immediately.

But not for long.

I awoke to a noise I had never heard before.  It was similar to those 1950's bomb raid cycles you hear in old war movies.  My eyes focused on the near full moon hanging outside my window as I rustled around for the source of the sound.  It wasn't until my hand touched the ipad that I realized what was going on.

"Movement Detected, Camera #1, 2:46am Dec 11, 2016" I read on the notification bar.

I switched apps to the live camera stream to see that my two "friends" were back. This time they were right against my front door, one of them clearly pushing in the vicinity of the knob.  After some consecutive movements, I could see that he had a pry bar in the door frame and was trying to pop it.

"Shit". I jumped out of bed, and in retrospect made an idiotic move.  I put my pants on. Had I been thinking I would have headed for the phone first, but in this moment I was so overtaken by instinct and emotion that my first choice was to be clothed.  Instinct can be a serious detriment in these situations.

After I hefted my jeans on and grabbed the gun from my side table, I ran downstairs to get the cordless phone.  This was another absurd mistake.  I have no idea why the hell I decided to head all the way to my kitchen to get a cordless phone to dial 911, rather than just using the mobile in my bedroom.

I made it only two steps down before I heard the door snap, and the sound of fast heavy boots in my front hallway.  There was no way I would make it to the kitchen for the phone. I knew it immediately and turned quickly heading back upstairs.  I was running for my bedroom to grab my cell phone when I heard the boots tromping up the steps behind me.  They were so close.  I did the only thing I could think of and darted into the bathroom, locking the door.

The door was solid, I told myself.  It was thick wood, and the ancient designer barn bolt was extremely heavy duty.  I would be safe here, and even if they somehow got through the door, I did have my gun.   I moved the wood cabinet that held my towels and toiletries in front of the door, got in the bath tub and prepared my weapon. I had considered blocking the door with my body but decided that if they could get through that door, they could certainly get through me at the same time.

I braced myself and focused on calming my breath as I heard them approach kicking open doors as they came.

"Hurgh hurgh hurgh"  I head the low panting breathing outside of the bathroom.  

"Shit." I thought. "They brought dogs this time. They will definitely know where i am."

The guttural panting got louder and louder. I imagined that this animal must have been huge and exceptionally nasty.  I had always had a fear of being attacked by dogs and I had never in my life heard a sound quite so threatening.  The pounding, pushing and grunting started immediately.  The men were clearly trying to force their way in.  I trained my gun on the door, ready to fire if they managed to burst through.  

I heard a horribly intense creak as I imagined them pushing the pry bar into the crack of the door, and resumed slamming against it as hard as they could.  The door bent and shot cracking noises into the air, hit after hit.  This went on for some time but the door never split and eventually it all stopped.

I let out a sigh as I heard them trade some muffled words and heard their footsteps going down the stair case.  Even so, I was going nowhere.  I was committed to sitting in that cold hard tub all night until I knew for certain they were long gone. So I sat and waited.

I heard rusting downstairs and my mind raced as to how they could possibly get to me,  and what they might be doing.  It was only minutes before I smelled it. Gasoline.

The moment my mind recognized the scent I heard the telltale "whoosh" sound of the flammable liquid igniting.  Judging by the sounds of movement, they had lit the first floor and bolted out of the front door.

I sprang into action, tossing the cabinet aside and unlocking the bathroom door.  My knuckles were white and red around the gun grip. I swung the door open and headed to the staircase only to find that the floor at the bottom of the steps were burning intensely.  I didn't think that there was any way I could get through that inferno undamaged no matter how quickly I moved.

I turned back up the stairs and into my bedroom, swiftly opening the window.  I thought to grab the ipad with the intruder footage as well as my cell phone and crawled out of the window onto the roof of my garage.  The cold night air took the breath from me, being shirtless and accustomed to the high temperature in my house.  This was made worse by pressing myself against the cold iron pipe running down the corner as I lowered myself near to the ground and jumped.

I stayed low for a minute scanning the street, looking for the pickup truck.  It was nowhere to be seen. I listened intently for any sounds of movement before deciding that the perpetrators were certainly gone at which point I ran to my neighbor's house and began pounding on the door.

"David, what...." Louis was in his robe and had clearly been sleeping soundly.

"My house is on fire, I need help" I pushed my way into his hall and picked up his phone to dial it in. Again writing this now, I'm realizing that this was unnecessary since I did have my cell phone on me.  It's interesting how the mind fails in these intense situations.

The police and fire crew arrived relatively quickly but far too late to save even a portion of my home.  I was questioned on site, and then agreed to go directly to the police station to file a report while I still remembered all of the details.

I told them everything.  I told them about Erica, her muddled talk about some secretive club.  I told them about the vandalism to my door, the men in my yard and showed them the security footage to back my claims. Unfortunately the footage was extremely blurred. At no point could we find a single frame that clearly showed their faces.  They were always motion blurred, or distorted by flashes of light coming from the road.  One frame where one of the two men had faced the camera directly, showed a solid black face with two bright white lights for eyes.  No detail, no clear lines outside of the silhouette.

In the end, there was little to go on.  The truck was not on the footage, so there was no chance to get a license plate number.  No clear faces or identifying marks were recorded. I had never seen the intruders myself.  It became clear that while they were looking into it, there was nothing solid at this point, except for tracking down and speaking with Erica.

There was only one thing that bothered me about all of this.  While the camera footage was blurry, the camera was pointed low enough to see the walkway and front porch.  At no time during the entire recording did I see the dog that had frightened me so badly in the bathroom. I watched it several times looking for that beast, to no avail.

I'll keep everyone updated as soon as I find somewhere to stay and deal with the insurance company, etc.  Obviously, I'd still appreciate any advice you can give me.  The comments yesterday were extremely helpful.  Had I not had the gun and the security cameras I would certainly be dead.  The people posting who lead me to that decision may have very well saved my life.  Thank you all.

That said, I have been in the position of truly loving more than one person at a time (I mostly kept these to friendships in the past) and I believe that if you feel this way, if you truly have love for more than one person, that it would be a terrible thing to waste or throw away.

There is so much hate and discord between people in this world, I feel like we need to use every single opportunity for connection, regardless of social norms. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I Met Someone *Wrong* on OkCupid </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-12 04:46:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I met Erica on OkCupid. 

After sending hundreds of messages on that site, trading occasional likes, and following down several winding paths that led nowhere, I found her.  She was quite a bit younger than me, attractive beyond all reasoning, intelligent, experienced and overall seemed like a very caring person.  We shared some phone calls after graduating from chat, and finally, the other night we managed to arrange a first date.  Being somewhat rusty in the dating scene, and being someone who always aims to please the people around me I asked her to decide what she would like to do.  We agreed to go bowling.  It was whimsical, sort of ironic in a "Lebowski" kind of way, and seemed to be a mutually safe place.

Erica did not have a car, so I drove down the winding gravel paths into a surprisingly rural area about a half an hour from my home in Bucks County.  I had lived here for decades, but had never seen the amount of deer that seemed to make her home theirs.  It took several wrong turns, google navigation, and a bit of instinct to find her house but I managed to do so right on time.  

She came running out of the dilapidated stone farmhouse immediately. I got out of the car and we immediately shared a warm hug.  As she leaned in towards me I noticed her eyes.  They were brown and seemingly normal, but when we got closer I noticed the intricate black wheel spokes leading to her pupils.  At that moment I did recall her mentioning her penchant for decorative contacts during one of our conversations.

The contacts were pretty edgy and cool, and Erica was an exact replica of everything I find attractive in a woman.  She was skinny, about 5'6", had several tattoos and wore leggings that would drive any sane person mad.  Hugging her in the driveway seemed like the start of something wonderful.  She was so warm and immediately disarming.

Bowling was a blast.  She immediately suggested that we share a pitcher of beer, and over the following hours of bowling, drinking, talking, and innocently holding each other I was feeling extremely positive.  We left the alley somewhat tipsy, and through the course of dinner I started to notice that the alcohol was beginning to affect her.  This got much worse over time.

Erica began asking me the same questions over and over again.  It got to the point where I had felt that I told her how old I was almost thirty times.  I realized that she had also been frequently asking me how I got up in the morning.  It started becoming clear that she struggled with depression quite severely and I did my best to listen and comfort her when I could.  She told me about being institutionalized for a few years, the cutting that she had done on her arms, and her tattoo.  Erica boasted an S.S. Iron Eagle Tattoo on her lower back. When she told me that I recalled that she had previously asked me if I was Jewish and I began to wonder if I was on a date with a skinhead.  I eventually brought the conversation around to her tattoo and question and was relieved to find out that she was not racist, but Jewish herself.  She had in fact,  gone out as a teenager and decided to locate and get the most offensive tattoo possible in an act of rebellion when she was younger.

This was this kind of extreme uniqueness that made me like being with her.  She was off-the-wall, and up until the point where we spoke about the cutting and the hospital, it seemed fun-crazy.  It soon surpassed that and just became clinically crazy. When she asked me how old I was again I pointed out the fact that she had asked this many times and did not seem to absorb my answer.  She stared at me dead in the eyes pausing first and then speaking up.

"No.... **They** are telling me to ask you that." She looked at me knowingly, as if I would understand.

This was the point where I decided that Erica was clearly mildly schizophrenic.  It was also the point where I decided that I would take her out for one last drink, since we had discussed a specialty bar near my home, and then immediately bring her home.

At the bar Erica became extremely erratic.  She would hug me, then push me away, hard.  She would shout at me asking why I was looking at her "like that?" and then  storm off.  She would return and sit in my lap, wrapping her legs around me.  This was when she told me that "they" don't want her seeing me.   She said that "they" were never fond of outsiders, and that she was only allowed to be with people inside "The Order."  I inquired about who she was speaking about, but only got several non-sequiturs mixed in with random information, such as the fact that Sir Elton John was part of "The Order". 

I became quite overwhelmed with her behaviour and breaks with reality as you can imagine, and drove her home quickly.  I was quite relieved when she fell asleep during the car ride.  

Upon arriving at her house and waking her, I helped her to carry some of her items in where she did everything in her power to get me to stay.  I stood firm as she tried to pull me into her bed with her.  The idea of it was beyond exciting, but Erica was sick. Anyone could see it and I could not bear to entertain even the thought of taking advantage.  I tucked her in, and kissed her on the forehead.  

"Kill me.  Please.... Kill me" she whispered softly and lovingly into my ear.

I told her that I had had a lovely time and left.  Quickly.

I drove home with very mixed feelings.  One one hand I was quite fearful that she could be dangerous in the right situation. I recall being relieved that she had not been to my home and seen where I lived.  On the other had, I felt quite deeply for her.  The pain that she was in.  The mental state which she had little control over.  I pondered whether or not it would be possible to maintain a positive friendship with her, without risk or harm to either of us.

Yesterday, the day after our date, I came home from work to find that the front door of my house had been vandalized.  I was shocked because I live in an upper-scale area and had never experienced this before.  As I walked up my porch steps I realized that what I had first thought was spray-paint was actually quite worse.  A shape had been literally carved deeply into my door, and was stuffed with some plant stalks with small purple flowers.  The symbol looked like a crude letter "P", if the curve in the "P" was a triangle, and placed lower down the vertical line it's the left.  Like so: |

I immediately felt a sinking feeling in my stomach.  Clearly Erica had found out where I lived.  I scanned my memory to see if I had left my wallet out, or told her my last name.  I could not recall but it was clear that she had found out somehow. 

"Fuck." I whispered heading into the house to get a trash bag.  I spent twenty minutes pulling the plant matter out of the door and examining my options. I was going to have the replace the door completely, no doubt.  I thought about calling Erica's parents or family but decided against that because she had spoken about them as if they were horribly abusive people.  The last thing I wanted was for her to suffer further at my hands. For the moment I decided to leave things as they were I would be cautious and vigilant, but I would attempt to simply let this pass.

I had a terrible nightmare last night.  Erica was sitting in my lap facing me, as she had done in the bar.  Her eyes started to change, slightly moving and morphing in a swimming kind of pattern as she opened her mouth wide and moved her face toward mine.  Her teeth began to replicate and shift, row after row like a time lapse of a shark's mouth over a lifetime. She unnaturally stretched forward and enveloped my face.  I shot upright in the pitch dark sweating and breathing heavy. I clutched my chest feeling my heart pounding hard, like a torturous drumbeat.

The beating stopped and silence took hold of the room.  It was dead quiet, but tense.  There was something here, something in the air.  I couldn't explain it but I felt it quite intensely, and began slowly stepping toe to heal towards my window.  I pulled a single shade and peered towards the street and my yard below.  And there they were.

Two men, dressed in dirty hunting clothes were moving back and forth over my front lawn.  They seemed to swap sides, moving fast but keeping low as if trying to make sure that no one could see them over my hedges.  I watched in awe as they darted around the perimeter of the house and one of them slowly tried approaching my front porch.  He got one step up and then turned and ran back to his companion, taking his shoulder with his hand and hastily saying something indistinguishable to him.  The two of them then hopped over the hedges and ran down the street to a blue pickup truck parked on the corner.

This was last night at about 3am.  I've not slept since.  The only story I can come up with is that maybe Erica told her family or friends that I had done something to her. Threatened her maybe.  And that they came to keep an eye on me or seek out revenge. 

I don't know if I should call her, her parents, or the police.  I'd like to leave her be if possible and not increase my involvement in her life, but I truly feel like I am not safe at home.  For now I think I'm going to go to the store and get a security camera today.  

If anyone here has any advice it would be highly appreciated.  I've never been in a situation like this and I have no idea what the right course of action is at this point.  I'm not sure I can let another night go by without doing something.

<TEXT> Tonight, I'm going to off myself.

So I guess this is my suicide note.  Although, it is more of a story and probably belongs here, if nowhere else.

Before you all get your liberal sensitivities in an uproar, and start begging me not to, I want say a few things.  Don't bother posting that life is worth it, and I'm a good person, and start asking why I'm doing this.  Fuck that. I could tell you that I am a piece of shit.  That I've always been a piece of shit.  I could back it up too.  I live in a shitty room in a boarding house in Philly for recovering addicts.  My roommates keep me up, ass-fucking each other every time the mood strikes them. I've been through three goddamned divorces and have two kids I've not been allowed to see for a decade now.  I work on and off in a warehouse packing and shipping crappy kink magazines like "Lactating Babes" or "Men in Diapers".  I haven't gotten off with a girl for years without paying for it. And yeah, the rest of my life follows suit.

But the fact is that none of this is the reason I've decided to end it.  I like fucking street whores.  I like low shelf whisky in my Schlitz.  I like the filthy fucking life I've created.  It doesn't bother me in the least.  I live for me.  I'm not proud. I enjoy myself when I decide to. It ain't all bad really.

So yeah. Why?  Why did I buy the 9mm off the street today from Black Frank?  I'll tell you.

My life started falling apart after my mother died.  I was fourteen years old and I had gotten really sick.  I never had been vaccinated, and I got the measles which almost killed me.  The worst part about it though was that when I broke the fever, I found out that my mother had died from an aneurysm. So at fourteen I woke up and my mother was dead. Gone. boom.  And she was the only one that really raised me.  My father was a mechanic and spent most nights working late and then at the bar afterwards.  He was just never around.

When she died, my father made a 180 degree turn.  He got all religious and preachy. He started riding me hard. Cracking down on me, keeping me from seeing my friends.  He generally went all Nazi out of nowhere, and it really rubbed me the wrong way.  At this point I had written him off completely. Now my mom was dead and here he was trying to take charge when I was becoming independent.  Let's just say that it didn't work out. I went twenty years without seeing my father.  I moved out, got a trailer, and lived it up since shortly after my mothers death.  In and out of rehab, a short stint in prison, years working and years not.

Yesterday I got the call.  Actually the boarding house got the call and it took a day for them to find me, but that's neither here nor there.  My father had been diagnosed with late stage lung cancer and likely only had a few weeks. It took me a while to decide whether to see him or not, but I decided to man up.  This was my last chance and time had worn away the anger I had been holding all these years.  I was left with only apathy for the man, but this was a last chance opportunity.

He looked like I remembered him, if some child had assembled his body from tree branches.  He was so skinny. Twisted.  The nurses told me that they were putting a tube down his throat tomorrow so I'd better talk to him today, while he was still on nasal oxygen tubes.

Right off the fucking bat, there it was.  That instant disappointment in his eyes, seeing me. I almost turned and walked out immediately.  I decided to sit.

After a few minutes of him slowly, wheezing, asking me about my life, and then dropping into silence, he told me he had something important he needed to share.  He actually apologized for riding me after my mom died, but honestly it didn't seem very sincere.  I pressed him.  I was pissed and I unloaded.  I told him he was a shitty absent father who never knew me.  I told him that riding me like that was the only way he could feel like a good parent, that he was selfish and that he should have known better.

"I needed you to succeed." I could see his eyes water up. "For your mother."

Needless to say, I knew this and it didn't excuse him from being horrible to me as a teen.  I unleashed on him even harder. Yeah, I was a dick, really harsh.

That's when he told me the story.

He told me that the night Mom died he had been out drinking, as usual.  It was getting late, and he had medicine from the pharmacy for me in the glove box of his Oldsmobile, so he cut it short, downing his last beer, and speeding home.

He knew something was off the moment he walked in the door.  He said there was this horrible rotting smell all through the house.  I had been ill for days, and certainly had been putting off some bad breath and body odor, but he said this was like a punch to the stomach.

All the lights were off, except my bedroom, so he dropped his keys and headed over to crack the door of my room where he saw my mother kneeling at the foot of my bed looking straight up and pleading.  

"You can't take him, he's just a boy" she was saying, staring three feet above my bed.

"Why? Why do you want him?...  but what will happen to him?"

He said that she would ask questions then stop for several seconds listening intently. He was paralyzed watching this surreal show play out.

"No!" she screamed. "I'll do anything. You can't have him!"

Then she dropped her head onto the foot of my bed sobbing.  My father said he almost walked in the room at that point, but stopped himself when she began again.

"Yes" she said. "Yes I will.  And you'll leave?  .... Just me? .... and that will be enough?" She looked up again, tears streaming from her eyes.

"I do... Yes.... I declare myself yours.... Yes... I declare myself the property of... Ibn Iblis.... and will accompany you.... to Jahannam." She struggled with the words, starting and stopping.

At the very moment that sentence ended she dropped to the floor. She was stone dead.  And my father said that at that same moment, I had gasped an enormous breath and sat up.  My fever broke within the hour, after my shocked father had removed my mother's body and called the coroner.

Today I found out that my shitty fucking life was given to me in trade for that of my own mother.  I learned that all that good she had, all that love had been given up for me.  For me to get drunk. For me to fuck disease ridden whores.  For me to shoot up and nod off in my chair.  That's what I've created with the price she paid.  That's what her sacrifice was for.

I'm sorry Mom. Goodbye. </TEXT>

<TITLE> There's Something Going On at The Julliard School </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-15 07:33:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello everyone.  My name is James and I saw something tonight.  I reached out to my friend Frank in Seattle and he suggested that I write a post here.  He told me, and I confirmed after reading several entries, that you all have a solid grasp of unusual situations.  I have no knowledge of the supernatural, conspiracy theories or anything of that ilk, but I do need  help.  I don't know what to do tomorrow and I'm hoping that you can help me decide.

I suppose that some background is in order first.  I have the best possible job, and I absolutely love my work.  This is not something that people are used to hearing from a groundskeeper so I'll help you to understand.  I always had a strong work ethic.  Growing up in the rural Midwest, this always equated to working with my hands.  My father had instilled these values in me before he passed, and my whole life has been filled with satisfaction around this kind of work.  There is nothing like seeing the immediate, direct impact that my manual labor produces before my eyes.

I spent twenty years developing these skills, running small teams, and working on bigger and bigger jobs.  When I turned thirty five and Susan and I had our son Michael I decided that I needed a change.  This was also attractive to me after cancer had taken my wonderful wife Leena. The change I was looking for was not in career, but to find a position that did not require quite so much of my time and attention.  I was a single father and needed to be present to guide my boy to manhood.

With my long and exceptional portfolio of work, along with recommendations from several very influential people I had worked for, I landed my position.  I am now, and have for ten years been head groundskeeper at the Julliard School for Exceptional Children in upstate New York.  Don't bother looking it up, you won't find any sort of public presence.  This school is exclusive beyond the normal definition of the word.  At most there are only ever twenty children here, mostly in their early teens.  There is no application process.  There is no waiting list.  The students that come here, simply come here. New students are always expected and we are forbidden from inquiring about their families or background.  My assumption has always been that these are the children of those holding very high level positions in the government, or the ultra rich.

The grounds of this boarding school are beyond reproach.  There are only five buildings on the grounds proper, but each are incredibly beautiful converted 1800's farm houses and barns.  The campus is surrounded by thirty acres of fields and forest, several streams, and a separate cluster of homes for the staff a mile or so from the educational buildings.  This is where Michael and I had made our home for the past decade, and we loved everything about it.  Beyond all of this I must also say that the salary is enough for me to consider full retirement in the next five to ten years which is rare in my industry.

I have a good thing here and I am serious about keeping it.  Being such an exclusive and, I imagine, expensive school there is quite a large list of regulations that are required of the staff.  It never really bothered me before.  I had a job to do. I was paid well.  All I needed to do was keep my head down, follow the rules and things would be fine.  I was sometimes annoyed by the curfew, but I had my son at home anyway and should be there for him even if he's already asleep.  I stayed clear of the classrooms when school was in session, and in the few times that I almost accidentally intruded, I found that the classroom doors were kept locked.  Most of my interactions with the students were kept superficial though occasionally one of them would communicate something very personal to me or strangely deep and confusing.  I was careful not to press too hard but it would be a lie to say that I was not intrigued by the minds of these very special children.  You could see the wisdom in their eyes.  It was apparent, and it was somewhat unnerving at times.

Tonight I broke a rule.  I had read online that there was to be a super moon, the likes of which had not been seen for fifty years.  The sky was clear, full of stars, and I had had a couple glasses of scotch.  Michael was asleep and I could feel the night breeze calling me.  I grabbed my corn cob pipe, put on my jacket and decided to take a midnight stroll through the hills to see the moon up close and personal.  

I have to admit to you all at this point, that the pipe did not contain tobacco.  I know it's more accepted these days, but for me smoking marijuana is not something I'm very proud of.  I don't do it very often, but now and again I do enjoy a puff or two.  I hope that this doesn't cause you to question what I'm about to tell you but I wanted to be up front about it.

I was about halfway between my home and the campus, just cresting over the top of a small hill when I saw them.  The moment I did, I dropped my pipe and knelt down.  I did not want to be found breaking curfew, never-mind with contraband in my possession. I peered over the side of the hill to get a better look at what was going on.

In the valley below were all of the students and one teacher, Mr Krone.  The student body was in a circle sitting Indian style and facing the center while Mr Krone slowly circled them with his hands held behind his back.  He was wearing what appeared to be an old British schoolmaster jacket, long black and flowing.  In the center of the circle was a wide flat stone.  Upon that stone was one student sitting bound and blindfolded.  I tried to determine which student this was but I was simply too far away and a light mist was present in the valley.

I started hearing this low droning sound coming from below.  It seemed to have several levels of turning melodies melding into this multi-tone tapestry of constant sound.  The low register of the overall affect was surprising as it was clearly coming from the children.  I started to swoon a bit at this point, getting that over-tired feeling that you sometimes do after smoking.  I felt heavy and began to break out in a light cold sweat, though it could have been the moisture in the air.

I watched as Mr. Krone pulled two long black poles from his jacket.  As he walked around the children he would occasionally strike them hard against each other making a loud cracking noise that echoed through the hills. Each time I would flinch, hearing the echo of the sound behind me and wrenching my neck to check behind me.  Upon the fifth such crack he spun and pointed the sticks at the child in the center of the circle in one lightening fast motion.

What I witnessed then was beyond horrible.  That boy. That poor boy.  His body lurched upward, his back twisted and bent backward.  I swear his body left the ground for a moment as his head bent almost fully behind his spine.  His limbs broke their bonds as they twisted in wrong and alternating directions. I could hear his elbows and knees snap as each twisted left, right and back upon themselves. God.  His eyes.  His eyes looked directly at me even though I was behind him.  His head now hung behind his neck covering his back and I swear he was looking at me, hair falling down over his tailbone. He let out one long, horrible, piercing shriek that seemed to stop time dead in it's tracks while those eyes were trained upon mine, until he simply stopped and slumped to the ground lifeless.

I am not ashamed to say it.  I ran.  I ran faster then I think I ever have and didn't stop until I slumped with my back against the locked front door in my kitchen.  After a minute of getting my head straight I checked on Michael to make sure he was safe and in bed which he was.  I haven't slept since.  It's 6 am here now and I need to start work again soon, but I have no idea how I'm going to do that.  I can admit it.  I'm more scared than I've ever been in my life.  More scared that I was losing my wife to illness and taking responsibility for my child.

If you have any ideas about any of this, please tell me immediately.  At this point I feel like I have a few options.  I could confront Mr. Krone or the children and try to figure out what's going on, but this seems dangerous.  At least too dangerous to attempt unless I sent Michael to stay with friends.  I could pretend everything is normal and try to figure out what's happening, perhaps gaining access to Mr. Krone's office.  I could call the authorities and see what they can do and if they can keep my name private.  I just don't know what the correct course of action is here.

Something is going on.  It is dark and it is scary.  Perhaps I should just pack up and leave as soon as possible, though it would be a shame to have to go back to working long hours and settle in a new town. I would appreciate any feedback or advice you can give me.  If you have any idea what I witnessed that information would be very helpful as well.  

Your's truly,

Fearful and out of my depth. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Please Don't Take My Heart </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-10 23:12:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This will be the first time I share this story in it's entirety.  It will also almost certainly be the last story I ever share.  I have a very short time and limited resources, so please do forgive me if I make this somewhat brief.

My name is Daryl Jacobs.  If you've not heard of me, I ask that you please read my account here before you search for my name online.  I will share the details that made me infamous, but I would prefer that you hear them from me first.  Public opinion can be  detailed, but it rarely has an empathetic or complete picture of those who suffer it's judgement.  My situation certainly exemplifies this.

I suppose that I should start with my condition.  When I was twenty-four I discovered that I had a severe congenital heart condition.  I was diagnosed with a large atrial septal defect that was growing and tearing over time.  At the time it was discovered it was so severe that a transplant was chosen as the first possible course of action.  For those that are in the know about these things, this is quite unusual.  It speaks to the severity of my condition at this point, and I was informed by many doctors during the time that I was lucky to be alive.

This situation was incredibly scary and painful as it was.  It was made worse by the fact that, at this point in my life, I had been enjoying my new family.  My wife Samantha and I had given birth to our daughter Selena just three year before this discovery.  We had bought a new home, and had been living in the honeymoon period after our recent marriage.  We had just had our first Christmas at home all together a short time before the incident that landed me in the hospital.  The thought of losing all of this so quickly, so near the beginning of this new adventure was unbearable.

Samantha had some very difficult emotional times over the following months.  Our lives were full of worry, tears, and anxiety.  We learned a lot trying to communicate about how we could structure things so that if I did pass, that she and Selena could support themselves.  These were very difficult conversations for us both but I felt entirely responsible for ensuring the continuation of my family if I did not survive. As often happens the particular difficulty of my situation became my saving grace.

A combination of my young age, decent health and new family moved me to the top of the transplant recipient list.  Only four months after my diagnosis I was being scheduled for a heart transplant from a donor who was very similar in age, size and health. We were overjoyed, but not without worry.  The success rate for heart transplants are not overly comforting.  The expected life span, post surgery, were also a grim reminder of the intensity of what I was about to go through.

As you most likely inferred, the surgery was a success.  I left the operating room at Cedars-Sinai approximately six months after my initial diagnosis, and twelve days after that I was allowed to return home with a clean, though frequently monitored, bill of health. I was also able to return to work that year having been given an open-ended leave of absence, and within one years time my life went from death sentence to a reasonable expectation of another twenty to forty years.

As dark as some of that time was, I came out of the experience with new values, and a lust for life and love for my family that I had never had before.  I was in an exceptional place mentally and spiritually at the conclusion of this little saga.  It was this, the incredible mental positivity I had, that made the upcoming ordeals feel so strange and alien to me.

The first incident that I can recall happened after Samantha and I had had an argument in the kitchen while making breakfast together on a Sunday morning.  I had this friend Kimmie at work.  She was a very attractive and incredibly intelligent thirty-something Asian woman and we had hit it off as soon as we were put into the same department a few years earlier.  We got pretty close at work and frequently shared lunches together.  There were the usual comments from our co-workers who would call her my "work wife", but it was truly just a platonic friendship, though intimate.  I guess that I had been talking about Kimmie for some time that morning and my wife Samantha just had too much of it.

"Can we please just stop talking about Kimmie!" She threw the spatula into the pan and turned glaring at me.

I felt really hurt.  I had been trying to tell her something important and I felt like she was really out-of-sorts with her own jealousy.  

"Fine." I shot back. "I'm going to go check on Selena."  This was a common relationship dysfunction that we had.  Any time we would fight one of us would step up as some kind of parenting super-hero.  

I headed down the hall to our daughter's room with the intention of spending some time playing with her while Samantha cooked and cooled down a bit.  When I pushed the door open I found Selena standing and staring directly at me, as if she was waiting for me.  I saw that she had been playing with her letter blocks on the carpet and I saw that her little left hand was pointing down at them.  For a moment, when my mind first recognized a readable word I was brimming with pride in her development.  When I read the word, and saw the smile on her face I swooned and grabbed the door frame to stop from falling.

"Betrayer" was spelled out in wooden blocks on the floor and Selena's smile turned into a giggle as she pointed at me.

I was overcome with shame and this feeling of suffocation.  I found it nearly impossible to breath and lowered myself to a squatting position, putting my face in my hands to overcome the incredibly overwhelming feeling.  Sweat beaded on my forehead as I struggled to regain my composure.

"Daddy Ok?" Selena's little voice broke the spell.  She put her little cool hand on my head and I righted myself.  When I did regain my composure I saw that the blocks were simply a random pile with no discernible pattern.  I went so far as to turn the pile of them over until I proved to myself that they could not have possibly spelled that word, even if Selena could have done so.  There were only half the letters present to spell "Betrayer". 

When I returned to the kitchen with Selena, and apologized to Samantha about going on about my friend, she immediately made me lay down in bed.  Apparently I was sheet white and sweating to a point that was immediately noticeable. I never told Sam what I had seen, just figuring that I must harbor some serious guilt about being so close to Kimmie, and it had come to a head after that argument.

In retrospect I see this as the first time it happened. I had many other similar, but different, instances of this type of thing over the coming months.  I recall walking past Selena's room one day weeks later, while Samantha was talking to her.  In just the split second of passing the door I saw my daughter look up at my wife holding her hand and asking "Why won't daddy just die?" 

I stopped dead and returned to the room. "What did you say?"

The both looked at my questioningly and asked why I was asking. 

"I thought I heard my name." I lied.

"We were just talking about her homework."

"Selena, you weren't asking about Daddy?" I was starting to feel like I was being patronized.  I had pretty clearly heard what was said.

"No Daddy. want me to?" She said it playfully, but she had this curl in her smile that felt goading.  Like it was a threat.

"No, I don't want to hear it." I was getting red in the face, I could feel it. I stormed off to the garage to work on a table I had been refinishing.

Moments later Samantha came in hot, and we fought for an hour about the way I had spoken to Selena.  I never told her what happened, just trying to blame it on a bad day.  She was not happy or particularly interested in my attempts to excuse myself.  It took a few days for us to completely recover, in which I paid particular attention to being extremely kind to my daughter and wife. This did seem to pass.

A few weeks later I got into a hot bath after dinner.  It had been a very stressful day. I found out that I was on a list at work, being considered for layoff.  Only half of my department was considered and I was included in the selection.  We were worried about income and Sam was putting a lot of stress on me to start searching for alternative employment immediately.  Selena was in a poor mood after being up late the night before and I just needed some escape.  As a father, the bathtub has become a sacred space for me to get the personal time and space that I need.  This day that peace was shattered.

I soaked and relaxed for the first couple of minutes.  I then started to notice that the heat of the bath was becoming too much and I was overheating.  I started feeling really thirsty and my heart began to beat louder and louder.  It got to a point where it felt like my heartbeat was shaking the tub, and pounding incessantly into my already aching head.  Then it just stopped.  I don't mean that my heart stopped, I mean that the intensity of the heat and noise stopped stealing my attention, and I began to hear the muffled sounds from the bedroom across the hall.

".... loves her... no ... not anymore.  I know....  we can't let him...." Sam was clearly talking to someone other than Selena. "No... done... He thinks... Kimmie and then Selena.  I know.... touched her.... middle of the night.... fuck, he's dead.... this time next week.  yes.  yes.  poison.  I need your help.... yes. hospital at 9pm.... yes. yes.  .... already dead."

I sat bewildered, intensely focused on hearing each word as this got more intense.  Her voice was cold and harsh. She sounded angry but resolved.  I had never heard Samantha talk like that before and it was frightening.  I jumped out of the bath, grabbed a towel and popped out into the hallway, trying to catch her on the phone before the conversation was over.  I found her in the kitchen doing dishes.

"Hey, who was that?" I asked.

"Who was who." without turning from the sink.

"On the phone."

"I wasn't on the phone."

I looked at her closely.  She had stopped doing dishes and seemed frozen, but still not turning towards me.  I could see tension in her shoulders.  I could feel the stillness in the room, and it set me off immediately.  I grabbed her shoulder and spun her to face me. She shouted, grabbing her left hand as I looked down and saw that she was bleeding.

"What the fuck!" She bent over gripping her hand, examining the cut and grabbing some paper towels to wrap it. "What the fuck is wrong with you?" She looked me dead in the eyes this time.

I stared.  I was caught between anger at her lies and the guild of having hurt her.  I couldn't seem to choose either direction.

"Mommy, Daddy hurt you!" Selena was now behind me.

I turned to comfort her and she flinched and backed up.  That's when the anger overtook me. My vision became like static, and started going red.  I spun and shouted "I want to know what the fuck is going on!"

Selena ran to Sam who held her close.  Sam's anger at being hurt seemed to be pushed aside instantly.  

"Daryl.  Why don't you go dry off and get dressed.  We can talk when you're ready."

It took me a moment, but the empathy in her eyes did calm me down.  I did just that, dried off and got dressed in the bedroom.  I came out to an empty kitchen. I searched the house to find them both gone and then the phone rang. Samantha explained to me that she was worried about me. That her and Selena were going to stay with Sam's parents until the weekend and that she wanted me to see my doctor.  At this point I had calmed, and Sam was very calm and reasonable, expressing a lot of concern about what was going on for me.  I was tempted to open up and tell her what I had heard from the bathroom but something stopped me. I knew what I heard, and if it was true I needed to be careful.  I was honesty afraid that Sam thought I was hurting Selena and was planning to do something about it.  The idea drove me mad, and  I didn't have any idea what to do about it.

I saw my doctor the next day, after Sam setup the appointment for me.  I assumed that she had been quite adamant and detailed about what she thought the problem was in order to get me a slot so quickly.  When I saw the doctor he said that he understood that I was experiencing some emotional swings.  After a checkup, his solution was to refer me to a psychiatrist.  On the way out of his office, headed to the front desk he inquired about any heart issues, and I described the strong heart beat in the bath tub.  I was informed that this was natural but that I should be mindful in the future with very hot baths.

He headed off to see another patient leaving me in the now empty lobby to provide my copay.  The woman at the desk was a wide eyed twenty something who looked like she was halfway between a goth club, and a Wall Street office.

"Oh, you're the guy that got his heart, right?" She said with wonder on her face.

"I had a transplant.  Do you know the donor?"

"Uh, of course, everyone was talking about it.  Wait... " she suddenly stopped and looked down.

"Who was he?"

"I'm sorry.... I." She started pushing papers to sign over the desk to me. "It'll be fifty dollars."

I could feel my temperature rising.  I bent down and slowly pushed the paper back toward her meeting her eye line.

"Everyone is talking about it.  You were about to tell me who my donor was." I recall seeing fear in her eyes. I recall that it aroused me slightly, in a way I had not felt before.

She looked to her left and right quickly, seeing no one around.  "JJ Harrow."

"Who is he?" I had no recollection of the name, though it seemed clear that she expected me to know him.

"The Philly Cutter?" concern in her eyes.

I stopped for a moment, thinking.  Then I remembered the newspaper stories from the previous year or two.  This guy, JJ, had been found guilty of several murders in the Philadelphia area and some surrounding states. I remember that he had begun randomly slashing women with a razor blade on busy center city streets.  Suddenly a victim would find themselves bleeding profusely to find later that they had been cut quite deeply near a major artery in their leg.  After a few weeks of that scare, it had stopped, and women had started to go missing at an alarming rate.  Over two months he had abducted and tortured twelve women in Pennsylvania and Tennessee.  He had strung them up and cut them slowly until they bled out.  Eventually they had decided to try him in Tennessee because that state had the option of the death penalty, which was the verdict in this case.

It all came together.  I had been giving the Cutter's heart.  I felt ill, and I could see the contention on the secretary's face.  I paid and left quickly, saying nothing further, and then returning to my empty house.  I made an appointment with a psychiatrist and had many talks over the phone with Sam and Selena over the next few days.  I didn't tell her about the heart, it was just too much and I knew it would just scare her.

That Sunday was the day.  It was the day they returned.  It was the day everything ended.  The last thing I remember was finishing a nice meal for them, and sitting on the couch waiting.  They were supposed to be home around one o'clock.  I remember it turning two. I remember sitting on the couch looking at the food getting cold on the table.  I remember hearing them come to the front door several times only to find that they weren't back yet. Then I remember nothing.

When the police cuffed and lifted my body from the pool of blood in my living room I could see the bodies of Sam and Selena.  Their eyes were wide, their mouths open.  I can still see them. I see them every day and all night.  I do my best to not think about them at all if I can help it.  They plague me and I ignore them.  There's nothing I can do for them.  I could punish myself but there is only a short time to do so, and I don't see the point.   I don't know exactly what happened but it was not me.  I. I am not me.

This brings me to the real reason I am bothering to write and smuggle this out this at all.  I am to be executed in five days.  Before I was locked up I had chosen to be an organ donor.  The prison is not allowing me to change this being so close to me execution (and I think just to deny me something, more than just my life, as further punishment.)

So I ask you.  No matter how ill you are.  No matter what you are going through even if it is assured death.

Please.

For your own good.

Please don't take my heart. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hold Tight to your Children in the Dark Woods. [Part 3] FINAL </TITLE>

[[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/59b8ck/hold_tight_to_your_children_in_the_dark_woods/)]

It took our group three full days to get to New Orleans.  It was Tony and I, our two children, all of our gear and Tony's cousin Theresa.  We had offered to pay Theresa to travel with us and watch the children, as she was the only semi-responsible, unemployed person we knew.  I didn't know her exceptionally well, but we were positive that there was no way that Tony and I could deal with whatever might come, having the children at our side every minute.  

During this trip we shared quite a lot of what had happened with Theresa, and had filled the children in on some key points.  I could not bear for Hunter to know that he had this impending sickness to look forward to, so our story was simply that this man had made Samantha sick, and that we were going to find him, and force him to make her better.  Samantha was very quiet throughout the journey, clearly suffering.  This was heartbreaking for both Tony and I to watch this sweet little girl slowly wasting away mentally and physically.  It was a lot for Theresa as well, though she did an excellent job of engaging her.

We arrived in New Orleans on a Tuesday night and checked into a moderately priced hotel.   Tony and I decided that it being nighttime, it was in our best interest to immediately scope out the house under the cover of dark.  Theresa was given some spending money and asked to take the children out for dinner, and generally entertain them for the evening.  

We dressed in black, grabbed a couple of handguns and a small assortment of gear and headed out. We parked five blocks from the location of the house, and slowly made our way to the home.  When we reached the block on which the house stood we squatted in the back yard of the home across the street.  Both houses were dark, and we were able to secure a position where we could not be seen from the street.

We used our binoculars and night vision googles to visually explore the house before us.  It was a gorgeous historic two-story with wrapped balconies and columns.  There appeared to be no one home at this moment.  We began preparing to get closer and see if we could find any possible easy entrance.  Before we could cross the street however, we started hearing  footsteps tapping down the sidewalk.  We ducked deeply back into the shadows.

Click. Click. Click. The hard shoes tapped away at the sidewalk getting louder and louder as we saw the figure enter the lit area beneath the street light.  Perfectly erect but walking languidly, Jack was approaching his front door.  He was casually dressed in brown slacks and a sweater.  He appeared to be just as he had been before, unharmed, unruffled and perfectly at ease.  He turned from the sidewalk away from us toward his front door and stopped.  The small gas lamp above his head lit, and he turned facing toward us.  We watched, my breath held, as opened a small pouch, extracted his pipe, and began to smoke.  He appeared to be looking directly at us, but we knew that we could not be seen.  For five full minutes he stood there, perfectly still outside of the movement it took to smoke.  He then tapped his pipe upon a stone near his walkway, turned and entered his home.

Tony and I had a short whispered debate about whether or not we should try to enter the house tonight.  It seemed like Jack was home alone now, and we felt that we did have surprise on our side, being so soon after our last encounter.  We decided against this plan since we did not have Theresa on the ready to bring the children if we managed to discover how to reverse what had been done to them.

In the end, we setup a small video camera to the side of the house we hid against, aimed at the front door of Jack's home.  We were able to connect the device to a nearby wifi hot-spot that was not password protected, so that we could view the live stream from our room. Being a hunter, Tony was very much interesting in gathering information by tracking Jack's comings and goings.  His position was that it would be best for us to enter the house when empty, and surprise him when he next came home.

That night we went back to the room and spent a few hours with the kids before turning in.  We explained our plan to Theresa and made sure that she would be prepared to bring the children to that location once we signaled her via text.  

We spent the entire next day watching movies, ordering pizza, and keeping a solid eye on Jack's house.  There was no activity whatsoever until about 8pm.  At that time, we were alerted on my laptop that movement had been picked up on the camera.  We watched as a black sedan pulled up to the house, Jack stepped into the vehicle which then promptly headed towards the city.

We acted fast.  We were standing in the private back yard within thirty minutes, and quickly found a viable entrance.  There was high window slightly ajar and by our estimation it likely lead to the kitchen.  I was able to boost Tony first, and then Tony assisted in helping to pull me up.  As we expected, we entered over the kitchen sink, and lowered ourselves into the dark room.  There was just enough light coming from the windows to allow us to navigate the room.  We quietly searched but we knew that we would be more likely to find information in other areas of the home.

We pushed through one of the two doors in the kitchen into a pitch dark room.  We did not want to risk turning on any lights so we decided to attempt to use the night vision goggles we had brought.  The moment I strapped them to my face, there was a searing pain in my eyes and head.  I was confused and I tore them from my face thinking that I must have stabbed my eyes when putting them on.  

After a moment my eyes adjusted to find myself standing in the center of a well lit ballroom, surrounded by about thirty men and women dressed as if they were attending a party.

"Surprise!" someone said mockingly from the back of the circled crowd.  He stepped forward slowly clapping his hands.  Jack stepped through the last line of participants smiling at the two of us.

"Truly a surprise to us all." he seemed to be giving us credit as the crowd tittered and whispered amongst themselves.  "We have not had your kind of distinguished company at my home in many many years.  I dare not tell you just how long."

Tony muttered an insult and made a move to charge Jack immediately.  He was stopped by two thick and heavy men dressed in black suits who held under the arms.

"I like that energy, Tony!  That may come in handy for you.  Why don't you save it for a moment though, we have much to discuss."

"I'll kill you." Tony growled, struggling against the men restraining him.

"Ah yes, but that't the rub, Mr. Freid." he paused smiling, "You've already done that.  I do so hope that both of you are adaptable.  It will be a necessary quality shortly."

Jack turned toward his surrounding circle of guests and politely requested that they move to the sides of the room.  I had become fearful that their intention was to crowd in on us, and do god-knows-what, but this was not the case.  Once the party guests had cleared the back of the room, we could see what had been behind them.

The back of the room housed an altar and a balcony.  It was much like an altar at a catholic church, but rather then being decorated in pure white, the cloth covering the altar was red and trimmed with gold.  Above the altar was an elevated platform on which stood what looked like two ornate, standing coffins.  They were almost Egyptian looking, but there were some consistently different design elements that were clearly not of that origin.

Worst of all though, standing in front of these containers were Samantha and Hunter.  They were bound, blindfolded and sitting Indian style before the containers, with a guard on either side of them.  

Tony and I both struggled, and were now both restrained.

"Yes! You see now.  This is why you are here." he raised both arms above his shoulders indicated our children behind him.  "This is always how things should be.  Your love and loyalty to your offspring have brought you here.  Here and now.  With me, and with us.  It is beyond Poetic."

While most of the guests looked interested, chatted and sipped upon their drinks, I saw one woman push her way to the front.  She must have been six foot three, tall, dark and Romanian looking. Her face was cruel, the light only increasing the shadow in her thin, shallow features.

"Let's begin!" She croaked with a heavy accent.

Jack's eyes rolled to the ceiling as he turned toward her.  "Oh Lizette, Would you please give me a moment.  Tonight's festivities will be enjoyable for us all, but more so if we can invite our guests to understand the impact of the game.  May I?"  He questioned her in a mocking tone, and proceeded after several moments of her frowning silence.

"Gentlemen.  You are here to save your children. I wonder however, if you understand the meaning behind what you have witnessed?"

Before I knew it I was shouting. "You take them. You steal away their lives, so that you can live.  You're vampires."

"Very good.  Much what I expected, though your mythological interpretation is a tad droll.  In essence though, you are correct.  They die so that we may live.  I will not try to convince you that what we give back to the world is worth this sacrifice.  I cannot expect you to even consider that, your position being what it is.  What I can do." he paused for several seconds "is return to you what has been taken."

Tony and I looked at each other questioningly. Was Jack offering to reverse the damage done to our children?  Would we return home with our children healthy and happy?

Jack watched us closely, smiling.  He was clearly enjoying the tension in this moment and reveling in it.  It was sick.  His eyes, his smirk.  This was his design and he took an unholy pleasure in it.

"For one of you, of course." He let that statement settle. "In a few moments you will both be given knives.  The man who kills the other will have his child restored, fully.  If you refuse we will take you after we have taken your children as you watch.  You see, eternity does become very tiresome. We have other needs, beyond your years.  Now, you may be struck with the urge to attack me or my brethren here." He indicated the people around the room.  "I can assure you that it is simply moot.  I think you now understand that there is no chance of winning in this situation, unless of course you follow the path that has been laid for you, generously by yours truly.  If you choose to take a guest or two with you, so be it.  I will not protest.  But understand that it would simply accomplish nothing."

Jack signaled the men at our sides.  Tony was dragged to the opposite end of the room.  The visitors backed against the walls, as we were made to kneel and each given long, thin stiletto blades.

My mind had been scrambling to find a way out of this, but at the point at which the knife was in my hand, the thinking had stopped.  The reality of the situation took hold, and I was just a man with a knife facing an opponent.

"One more time before we begin.  When one of you is killed, the other will have his child restored.  At your convenience, please begin."  Jack and his guests became still, staring and examining the scene intensely.

Tony and I began to circle each other, slowly at first, then speeding up.We were just from arms reach when I whispered to him. "I have an idea."

He looked to his left and right, as if to see if anyone had heard the communication, and clearly excited that I thought there may be a way out of this.  He nodded his head to me.  He was ready for me to make a move and put my plan into action. I leaned in, close to his ear getting ready to whisper my command.  Then my knife was in his neck.

There was nothing for it.  I was again given a choice to save Hunter, or let him die.  Nothing could change this.  And nothing would change my choice.  Ever.

I forced myself to look Tony in the eyes as he bled out on the floor before me.  I saw his pain, his anger, his submission.  I think that I saw the understanding behind all of it as well though this may have been a hopeful interpretation.

The crowd moved forward, bending and examining Tony's body excitedly.  Three of them eventually carried the body out as there were raucous cheers and congratulatory looks from the party-goers.  I remained kneeling, staring at my bloody hands after dropping the knife to the marble floor.

"I am so very happy that it is you.  And Hunter will be as well." Jack smiled at like a loving father would, betrayed only by his dark eyes.

The two men upon the raised platform escorted our children into the two standing coffins, and shut the covers.  Shortly thereafter one of the men opened the tomb on the left and extracted the now still body of Samantha, carrying her out the same door through which they had removed Tony. 

"Now, we have another winner, aside from my friend here, namely me! More importantly, we have a loser." Jack smirked coldly.  "Lizette, if you would my dear?"

Jack took Lizette's hand in his, and lead her up the platform and guided her into the now empty casket which Samantha had occupied a moment ago.  The lid was shut and I watched as everyone in the room bowed their heads in silence.

I immediately began to weep when after a minute, Jack opened the cover of the tomb on the right and Hunter stepped out.  I saw the guard near him remove his blindfold, and point to me and whispering something. Hunter quickly ran down the steps to embrace me.

This was it.  It was done. I had my boy, he was healthy and I could put all this behind me to move on with my son.  I swept him up in my arms and stood.

"May we leave?" I asked Jack politely but forcefully. 

"You may." he stated from the platform, looking down at me. "But there is one final piece of information you may want to hear."

The bastard actually waited until I asked him what it was before speaking again.  I was once again becoming furious at these turns.  I wanted out of this place, immediately.

"Your son, Hunter.  He is special now.  He is part of our Society.  You see, due to the wager that was made, Lizette has provided your lovely son with not one lifetime, but several.  Hunter will remain as he is today, strong, healthy, and energetic for just under five hundred years, thanks to his benefactor.  You must also know that Hunter will remain exactly as he is today.  He will not grow, age or develop any further.  And, I would think, that he will continue to need his loving father in his life."

I stood in shock.  This only got worse.  Each time I thought that I had made the ultimate sacrifice for my child, the reward was tainted.   Each outcome worse than the last.

"You fucking bastard." I could only whisper it as I fell to my knees.

"Yes well.  I have been a bastard of this world in which you live for some time now.  But I am not heartless.  I have done nothing but give you choices, and now I will offer the final one.  You may leave with your son and care for him until your years expire, at which point he will likely return to our society for guidance and care taking.  Or you may collect on the remainder of Lizette's wager, and live with him until you have both expired together."

I silently took in the entire history of what lead me to this moment.  I had lost my son, recovered him, gained knowledge that I would lose him again, and was now standing here after killing my friend, being offered extended life.  It was too much for my mind to handle.  I focused upon only one thing.  My son. My Heart.  My love and greatest achievement.

I took the deal, and before morning we were both headed back home.  We had lost Tony. We had lost Samantha.  We were informed that Theresa was no more as well. I had only one thing left, and I love him so much.  I will love him for centuries to come.  I will share my entire self, my entire life with Hunter, always.  Until the long awaited end of our days. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/59069x/hold_tight_to_your_children_in_the_dark_woods/)]

I never expected to be writing here again.  Frankly I am devastated that this is the case.  I wrote my first post as a means of confession, to display my sin to the world and ask for understanding.  Thank you to everyone who commented and suggested alternative courses of action, as well as those who simply expressed sympathy for my decision.  I am now in the very unfortunate position to admit that my choice had been the wrong one after all.  I thought I was saving my son.  I now know that I was sorely mistaken.

I will pick up where I left off in my last post.  I had submitted completely to the man who seemed to have the power to appear and take my child at will, by promising to deliver to him the daughter of my sister.  That very day I reserved a small vacation cabin in the same forest in which I had lost my son.  I called my sister to explain that I had reserved that cabin each year and had forgotten to discontinue the repeating reservation.  I told her that I could not bear to be there, but I would feel honored for their family to use the cabin as a tribute to the wonderful times that Hunter and I had spent there throughout his life.  The ploy worked perfectly and my sister, her husband and their daughter Jessie made arrangements to take a vacation.  

I was crushed after I hung up the phone, but reminded myself over and over that this was the only option.  This was the only way that my beautiful boy could remain in this world and lead a full life.  Besides which, she would be returned, good as new sometime in the future. It was selfish, but only as much as it was protective.  I could not convince myself that I was doing the right thing.  I could only manage to steel myself against changing my decision.  I literally felt as if I was turning to stone, bound to accepting and participating in this madness out of unquestionable necessity.

Two days previous to the reservation I received a visitor.  I was surprised to hear a knock at my door, as I had made almost no social connections in our new home.  I immediately feared that it was my sister who I dreaded facing in person.

I opened the door to find Tony. I had not seen him in almost seven years but recognized him immediately.  He had changed and not for the better.  He looked like he had aged twenty years.  His hair was grey, his shoulders slumped, and his face seemed to droop from his skull as if it had given up holding on to his skull quite some time ago.

"Thomas." it stuck in his throat, and took him a second to recover. "I think you know why I am here."  His eyes looked up from his lowered head like a dog who knows he is about to be punished.

"Yes. I do."

"We need to talk." clearly relieved at my measured response. "Samantha is in the car, I didn't want to bring her to the door right away. I didn't know...." his head dropped again.  "May I bring her in?"

"Sure.  Hunter is playing in his room.  She can join him."

Tony went to the rusty station wagon parked on the curb and helped his daughter from the car. I could immediately sense that she was not well. She seemed to lean to one side, favoring her left foot and Tony held the palm of his hand to her back all the way up to my door.

I looked down to greet her as best as I could, but stopped dead.  Samantha was about twelve years old.  She clearly had a cataract in one eye, was shuffling with her bad leg, was missing at least one tooth in the front and seemed to be developing grey in her hair.

"Hi Sam" I managed to expel in a shuddering whisper.  

I looked up to see Tony's eyes welling with tears, locked onto mine intensely.  He needed to say nothing.  What he had come to discuss was already quite clear.  My heart sank as the full scope of the situation became apparent to me.  

No. It could not happen again.  I had lost my boy for years, I could not fucking do it again. A rage burned in me as I thought about this happening to Hunter.  I raged at my choices, at my lack of fight, at my deception and assistance in spreading this cancer.  I held it deep inside to smolder and burn as I introduced Sam and Hunter until they were comfortable playing together alone with Hunter's door shut.

The moment it closed I pulled Tony into the den.  I opened my mouth to begin questioning him, but he beat me to it.

"She was fine for about nine months.  Everything was perfect." He began to weep again.  "Then she got sick.  They thought it was just a bad flu and treated her with antibiotics. Then her leg. They couldn't figure it out, but they tested her for bone cancer which came up negative.  Then her teeth began falling out, then her eye, and just...." He fell to the ground, squatting awkwardly.  "It's just getting worse, faster and faster."

My mind raced.  Nine months.  I could only assume that this would also happen to Hunter in in a similar time frame.  I dropped to the floor and sat, putting my hand on Tony's back as he struggled to regain his composure.  I could not hate this man.  I understood his actions all too well.  

After a time, we both made our way to the couch and talked for several hours.  We compared stories and started a mental examination of the details of our interactions with this man, Jack. One of the first differences that stood out was that Jack's demand of Tony was simply to choose a child that he knew.  Someone that he had ties to.  As you may remember Jack had demanded that I actually arrange the trip that would lead to the abduction of my sister's daughter, Jessie.  Tony indicated that myself and my son had immediately popped into his head the moment he was questioned even though he had not seen us for years. Furthermore Tony said that Jack seemed to smile knowingly after hearing our names, as if he had expected them.

Aside from that, almost everything else seemed to be basically inline with my experience.  Samantha had disappeared when Tony brought her along for one of his hunting trips, the first time he had ever chosen to do so.  He came upon the man on another such trip years later.  His description of the contents of the "room" matched mine exactly, though Jack was dressed differently during his interaction.

At the end of several hours of conversation, emotional instability and heated debate we quickly came to a conclusion.  In two days we knew where Jack would be.  It would be our only chance to locate this man, capture and question him.  It would be our only chance to find some way to determine if we could repair the damage done to our children, and to then ensure that it never happens again.  We decided that our primary goal was to find a way to save our children, but regardless we would stop this forever.

It seemed that Tony had come prepared for this conclusion.  His station wagon was loaded and ready with an array hunting and camping gear, as well as a wide collection of army surplus items.  We informed the children that we would be taking them on a camping trip for which Hunter became very excited.  Samantha however, took some convincing.  Tony and I spent the rest of the night planning and sharing food and a couple of beers.  I liked the man.  He was entirely different from the boy that I had known in school, but he had a very quiet, thoughtful deepness to him while he retained a simplistic life.

We packed up and left my home early the next morning for the long drive to Allegheny.  Upon arrival we located the cabin that I had reserved and spent the next few hours finding the perfect place to setup camp.  We wanted to be somewhere where we could easily observe the activity of my sister's family without making our presence known.  If my sister spotted us, there would be some serious explaining to do.  In the end we picked a site on the side of a hill overlooking the cabin approximately three hundred yards away.  We setup our tents, got the children situated and began our preparations.

There were two trees very close to each other in front of our camp where Tony and I setup two tree-stand seats. From this height we were unlikely to be seen, and using his high powered binocular's we had the ability to observe almost every angle of the cabin.  We also prepared go-bags, knowing that at any moment we may have to move out and track the activities of my sister's family.  Since we had a night left before their arrival we also had the opportunity to examine the cabin's surroundings a bit.  We were lucky in that there was a motion detection light post near the entrance way to the cabin.  Having had some experience with electrical work, I was able to rewire the light to remain on permanently.  This would illuminate the grounds at night and ensure that we could clearly see any activity after sundown.

After hours of preparation we spent the evening involved with the children by the camp fire.  I remember Hunter starting to become very protective of Samantha, holding her  around the waist by the fire.  Tony and I met eyes and became silent at the sight of this, trying to hold back the despair, and hold onto our anger.  We would catch this fucker.  Jack would pay, and we would do everything possible to reverse this damage.  Focusing on this was all I could do to hold onto my self. 

After a moist and uneasy sleep we began our watch.  We sat in the trees and each watched our children playing below, and my sister's family arriving and beginning to move luggage into the cabin.  It was very odd to silently and remotely watch every move they made, trying to fill the silence of their distant conversations in my mind as I tracked their movements.  Throughout the day Tony and I took turns watching, and spending time with our kids.  When they made trips to the park offices Tony tracked them, taking his walkie with him to alert me of any unusual activity.   Most of the day passed without incident, and they  did not leave the cabin often, likely just settling in and relaxing.

That night was when it happened.  Tony and I both were in the trees and completely alert, each watching the cabin with our binoculars when we saw the front door swing open.  Little Jessie stepped out in her white nightgown, and closed the door very cautiously.  We watched as she stepped off of the front porch onto the lawn and pointed her finger straight in front of her, eyes wide. She then slowly spun as if drawing a circle in the air around her with her finger-tip, then stopped facing directly to the west. Jessie then lowered her arm and began walking in that direction into the woods. The way she was headed was perhaps only thirty degrees from our campsite, so she would pass us by two hundred feet or so.  This gave us time to do a bit of extra preparation.

 We grabbed our bags, and told the children that we were going to take a nighttime hike.  We told them that we had seen Hunter's cousin Jessie and were going to make a game of following and protecting her.  I cannot say that either child bought our story completely but they complied.  Tony had brought a hiking backpack that had a child's seat built into it.  Samantha was much too old for this, but he managed using it to carry her as we followed Jesse.  The moon as nearly full and the night was clear so we did have enough illumination to be able to navigate safely without using our flashlights and risking discovery.

In approximately thirty minutes we started to see this warm light in the woods directly ahead of Jessie.  We again stressed that we needed to be exceptionally quiet to Samantha and Hunter, and cautiously continued until we had a full view of the scene from a hundred feet away.

There he was.  Jack was sitting in his leather chair dressed to the hilt in a full tuxedo, and surrounded by his complete collection of living room furniture.  This time the lamp was off, and instead his little "room" was decorated by tens of candles.  

"Take Sam." Tony whispered urgently.

Withing a minute I had her off of his back and situated.  Jessie was quickly approaching the "room" and Tony was fitting an arrow to his hunting bow.

I lowered down to a squat and told Hunter and Sam that Jessie was in serious trouble, and that the man in the distance was evil.  I asked them to sit quietly and close their eyes while Tony and I made sure that Jessie was safe.  They accepted this and did what I asked of them, though clearly they were beginning to become very anxious.  Again Hunter reached out and comforted Sam as they sat facing the other direction.

"Five... Four... " Tony began, setting the pace and then becoming silent.

I heard him inhale, and exhale as the arrow flew through the air.  The moment I saw it strike Jack, I yelled Jessie's name and ran toward her as we had planned. I was there in seconds scooping her up in my arms protectively.   She seemed to come to as she said my name in surprise. I ran with her back to Hunter and Samantha and commanded the three of them to stay exactly where they were, as Tony and I headed toward Jack.

We could see that Jack had by now pulled the arrow from his right shoulder where it had been lodged.  He held it in his hand as he peered at us walking slowly toward him.  His recognition took a moment, but it came.

"Well, look who it is! Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner!" he boomed.

Tony and I picked up our pace, seeing that he was mobile.  The last thing we wanted was for him to escape, leaving us without answers. 

Jack reached quickly into the pocket of his jacket and extracted something, heading for the door.  It appeared that he was attempting an escape so Tony yelled for me to tackle him as he stood firm and fired another arrow.  The arrow struck his right leg, as he inserted the key into the door and turned it.

The moment the key was turned, the contents of the room seemed to fall and spread in a million loose, smoky particles around him.  As I entered the area I could see the dark wood colored cloud that had been his coffee table swirling around my legs. In the split second it took me to reach the man himself, Jack had taken the arrow that he had freed from his shoulder, and plunged it into his own neck as he stared at me dead in the eye.  He fell.

I dropped and turned his body over, blood gurgling from his mouth and throat.  I demanded he tell me how to help our children, demanded that he fix what he had broken.  He only looked me in the eyes calmly as he shivered and then fell silent and still.  His body was now the only thing in the darkening clearing. All seemed lost.  Jack was dead, but our children had no remaining hope.  I sat upon the cold ground and mourned.  I mourned what I would soon have to face, watching Hunter die a slow death.  This failure far outweighed the success we had in ending the man before me.

Tony headed back to collect and protect the children.  After a time I began to examine Jack's body, all while wondering what exactly to do with it.  Upon his person, in the interior of his jacket pocket, was one single item.  A letter.  It was elegantly penned, stamped and sealed with a small wax circle, crest and all.  

Over the next ten or so hours, Tony and I completed our immediate work.  We returned all three children to the cabin, giving hurried and worrisome information to my sister.  We told her enough to allow us to leave, return to the scene and bury Jack deeply.  We came back afterwards, tired and dirty and explained everything from start to finish to my sister and husband.  I don't know what I expected from that conversion, but at this point I am positive that it is the last one I will ever speak with them. We packed up and returned to my home, the four of us together.

We repeatedly studied, examined and discussed he contents of the handwritten letter we had found on Jack's person, which were as follows:

+++

*Jack D.*

*1XXX Third Street*

*New Orleans, Louisiana 70130*

*My Dearest, and most wonderfully despised Lizette,*

*I have heard, via my usual sources that your collection has grown by great bounds this decade.  I find it disheartening that you continue to focus so mindlessly on quantity over quality.*

*The way you destroy this art of ours is abhorrent. The way you just end things, and leave those souls to be found in such a mundane and obvious manner. Why do you insist on this stark outcome for those we collect, my dear?  There is no artistry, no beauty, no flow in what you do.*

*I take pride in my work.  Every single one I collect is a symphony of anguish.  Everyone affected by my reaping takes a journey. They follow a wondrous arc of emotion. The loss, the recovery, a miracle and then the despair of a destiny they could never have escaped.  Beauty my dear.  This should be about beauty!*

*But you have no eye for aesthetics.  You base, shallow beast.  This was so obvious to me the last time you murdered me.  Such a poorly constructed and thoughtless action, so beneath our kind.  How dare you treat me in such a gauche manner.  A shotgun to the stomach.  Frankly it was just like you, base and trite.*

*I assure you Lizette, that you will learn my artistry whether you will to or not.  I will show you what can be accomplished when one is passionate about their work, rather than a mindless hoarder such as yourself.  I shall do so posthaste!*

*All of my Love,*

*All of my Hate,*

*Jack*

You can interpret this for yourself.  I cannot take the time to explain what we gleaned from this letter. The most important thing however was the simplest.  We had an address.  We had a location.  I am packing up my laptop now that I am finished writing and we are beginning our road trip to New Orleans. This is not fucking over.

<TEXT> What I am going to share with you today started many years ago.  It was a time in my life marred by tragedy, severe depression and several near attempts at suicide. It took an immense amount of emotional exploration and healing as well as time, but it did lead me to my passion for travel and exploration that became the most meaningful thing in my life.  The dark did eventually lead me to light. But that was only temporary.

It was six years ago that I lost my son.  My heart.  My wholeness.  I had been a single father for almost all of Hunter's life until then.  His mother went off the rails and left for Colorado with her dealer almost immediately after recovering from her pregnancy. It seemed that the year she had spent clean had simply been too much for her.  She snapped back from the unusually long period of sobriety and clearly was not able to cope with the responsibility of parenthood.

I was not perfect either.  But to be fair and allow myself to simply be proud, I will say that I really stepped up as a father.  With the challenges I was given, I did an exceptional job of putting myself aside and making Hunter the center of my life.  I did everything for him, and the love that we shared was the most rewarding thing I had ever experienced.  Until he was suddenly gone.

We had been on a three night camping trip in the Allegheny Forest.  Hunter was six years old, and though he was becoming slightly more resistant to the plans I would make, he absolutely loved camping.  We would sit by the camp fire at night, and he would begin these conversations that would quickly become philosophical.  It was so wonderful for us to discuss whether or not we both saw colors exactly the same way, and try to answer all of the child like questions that would lead to mystical and esoteric exploration.

It was mid afternoon when we broke to eat lunch.  We had just climbed hundreds of vertical feet to the top of an incredible waterfall.  We sat, eating  cheese and pepperoni on the boulders near the head of the falls.  We rested, lied back and warmed our bodies in the sun.  Fat and happy we soon both swooned in the beating sunlight and took a small siesta.  I remember maybe thirty minutes of that strange dreamy, restful but half conscious sleep that happens in direct sunlight.  Odd shapes and scraps of memory paraded through my semi-consciousness.

 When I turned on my side to check on Hunter, he was gone.  There was no one in the area.  I called for him and searched for hours alone, absolutely distraught.  I cannot even allow myself to describe the state I was in because frankly, I cannot bear to come anywhere near to experiencing that feeling again.  Please forgive me.  I cannot.

After what seemed like two hours a family came hiking through the area I was in.  I told them what had happened through tears and worry beyond comprehension.  Within hours the rescue teams came in, along with local police and the hunt began. Bless these men and women.  Bless them and bless the local people who took part in the search.  For five full days they searched, day and night, through storms and overcast skies.  I never had a single moment where I thought that more could have been done for my boy.  My heart. My life.

After five days there was no choice but to slow and then stop the search.  There was not a single sign of Hunter.  There was nothing, and in the end after another five days of my wandering the trails, scanning the waters, and haunting that forest like a ghoul, I went home.  The moment my front door shut behind me as I entered, my soul was destroyed.  Coming home without Hunter was very nearly the end for me.

I drank constantly for months. I took painkillers, frequently mixing the two in the extreme, nearing overdose many times.  It was during this period that my sister visited.  We had been estranged for years at this point.  I won't go into detail and I don't want to be unfair, so I will just say that our personalities just never meshed.  It was like mixing fire and gasoline every time we met.  We always loved each other but the incredible intensity of our respective personalities was simply too much to exist peacefully in one space.

She did love me.  She did care.  She invited herself without my knowledge, showing up at my home on a Tuesday with her new one year old, Jessie in tow.  She found me in my boxers, nearly unresponsive, unkempt, unshaven, and living in filth.  She stayed for a week, cleaning, propping me up, getting me involved in grief groups.  She even found out that my friend Tony from school had lost his daughter just a year before Hunter went missing, and put us in touch.  I tried so speak with him and share the common experience, but he seemed never to be able to open up.  I would try to share my grief and he would just cry and say nothing, clearly turning inwards with his pain.

My sister did help, but I had a very difficult time being around her daughter.  It was simply too much to live in that house with her child. Eventually when she felt that I was stabilizing, she returned home and consistently checked in with me on the phone or on Skype when she wanted to see my face, and see that I was not failing back into severe self-medication.  For the most part this did not happen.  For the next three years I was on a slow and painful journey, but it was a journey towards partial recovery.

At this point I had come to my life's passion.  Over those years I discovered that the thing that made me feel most whole was exploring new places.  I became a seeker.  I had sold my small house, collected unemployment and traveled full time.  I would stay in hostels at times, camp often, and once in while treated myself to a nice hotel room where I would shower for hours and sleep like a baby.  I traveled much of Europe, spent some time in Chile and Bogota, lived in Spain for several months, but eventually returned to the States to begin camping up and down the east coast.

The day that my life changed again was during a hike through the thick forests of Maine.  It was after noon and slightly overcast which gave the woods this rich mossy feel.  As usual I was hiking and contemplating the universe.  Thinking about reality and how the level of randomness in probability theory must ensure the possibility of the incredible.  My mind often wandered towards such elusive and mind bending topics.  However, before this day I had never actually experienced the possible impact of such expansive considerations.

I had left the marked trail perhaps twenty minutes previous and was exiting a very thick section of forest, into a small clearing.  I stopped dead in my tracks, my eyes widening and my mouth gaping like a buffoon.

There before me was a gentleman sitting in a leather chair in his living room, wearing a paisley silk robe.  When I say he was sitting in his living room, I mean it.  However there was no house.  In this small dark clearing there stood the entire physical contents of what appeared to be a very dated, but classy living room.  He sat with his legs crossed, one slipper dangling over his knee next to a standing lamp in front of a mahogany coffee table. There was a very old wooden radio in "the room" and a small fireplace with free-standing chimney burning and smoking before him.  The only other actual structure whatsoever was a single door, and door frame behind the man.  Everything else was just a collection of common household items.  Picture frames on a small side table.  A set of coasters, and glass of whiskey on the coffee table in front of this gentleman. 

"Well, hullo!"  The man put down the book he had been reading and rose to greet me with a wide, welcoming smile beneath his thin black mustache.  "If you would forgive my informal attire, I would love for you to join me for a moment."

I stared blankly trying to comprehend this situation as the man remained standing, laying a welcoming hand toward the chair beside his.  I cannot tell you what I was thinking.  I don't know if I was thinking.  The oddness of this experience seemed to lead to some strange state of hypnosis. The result was that this was an incredibly unique and valuable experience, and I had no choice but to be a part of it.  Doing otherwise would be to cast aside a miracle.

I calmly approached the man, skirting around his furniture and introduced myself, shaking his hand.  I remember that his hand was incredibly warm, almost hot.  The whole space he was set in felt exceptionally warm in comparison to the forest I had been exploring.

"My name is Jack. My mother used to call me Cracker Jack as a child.  I must have been quite the handful" he smirked warmly as we both sat.  "So what brings you to my home here today?"

I explained that I had spent the last year exploring and camping, dodging several inquiries about what had lead me to this lifestyle.  I was generally mesmerized by the situation, but could not bear to tell this strange man of my loss.

He pushing a small plug of tobacco from a pouch on his side into his pipe and lit it.  He inhaled deeply, raising his eyebrows slightly. His eyes narrowed, examining my face very closely.

"We just met sir. I understand your trepidation.  But I am only here for a very short time.  I am happy to share this time with you, this unique opportunity for connection.  But I do know why you travel.  I do know why you seek."

His eyes locked mine as if they were trapping a rabbit.  He peered intensely and I could feel him seeing me in fullness.  It was not entirely uncomfortable.  It felt like I used to feel as a young child when I prayed.  It felt like God could see every corner of me being in completeness, but there was benevolence there.  He saw me, and it was perfectly safe.

"Hunter." he whispered.

I put my face in my hands.  I had no compunction to ask him how or why he might know my son's name.  There was nothing there for me but the sorrow that this name still evoked.  I was seen.  I was laid bare to this man. 

"Yes, Hunter.  Such a wonderful child, and such a terrible loss for you. Let us end that loss, Michael.  Shall we?"

I raised my eyes to look at the man, wondering what he could have possibly meant.  I did at this point start to feel slightly anxious.

His answer was to put his pipe on the coffee table, slowly rise, turn, and open the door behind him.  

My God.

Standing there was Hunter.  He was just exactly as he was the day he was lost.  He was the same age and wearing the same clothes. His face lit up seeing mine, and he ran to me embracing my neck with his warm, wonderful smelling arms.

My knees gave out completely, dropping me to the ground to accept this unworldly embrace.  I cried and collapsed as my hands explored and felt his little body.  His face, his birthmarks, the way his hair smelled and his bright little eyes were just as they were.  He was here.  It was him. My boy.  My heart. My love.

After several minutes of just holding him I raised my questioning face to the man in the robe.

"I want nothing more than to send you home with your son as soon as possible." He stated.  "As I am sure that you understand. I have done something wonderful for you and it is only fair that you may offer to return the favor, yes?"

"Anything." I whispered through my tears.  And I meant it fully.  There was nothing I would not do, for this to be reality.

"I appreciate that.  And I can see that you are being completely honest with me." he sounded so very sincere. "You may take your son home now and enjoy the rest of both your lives, and I ask only one thing.  In one year I will visit you.  At this time I will make one single request.  You must do that one thing for me.  It will be a small simple errand. It is the only thing I ask in return for your wonderful boy."

"Yes." I said simply.

"Very well Michael.  Be on your way then, enjoy every minute and every facet of that wonderful young man."  He smiled at both of us and ushered us away from the living area, and back toward the path.

Just as I had walked out of the forest missing Hunter years previous, I now left this forest with my son by my side.  He remembered nothing of the years after our previous trip and seemed completely and utterly himself.  We talked, and joked, and hugged occasionally as we made our way to the trail, then to the lot, and then back to Pennsylvania where I located a job and bought a small condo.  I could not go back to our home town since there would be too many unanswerable questions, so we started a new life.  Hunter and I spent every waking moment fully engaged with each other until he started school.  This entire time I continued to speak with my sister but could never determine any possible way to share the knowledge of Hunter's return.  The story was too odd, too unbelievable for me to consider attempting to explain.  I simply lived in the bliss of having him back, and decided that knowledge of his existence would be mine alone.

Shortly after Hunter's seventh birthday I dropped him off at school and headed home.  I descending the steps into the building's laundry room with a basket slung over my shoulder.  I stepped through the laundry room door to find myself standing in a timeless, 1950's style living room with the man from the forest sitting in that same leather chair before the fireplace at the eastern wall.  Everything was exactly as it had been in the forest, except that there were walls surrounding the room rather than forest.

"Michael, wonderful to see you!" He rose and shook my hand.

I immediately fell into the chair by his side, feeling strangely worried and defeated.  I didn't think that he would take Hunter away from me, and I did not necessarily fear the request that I knew he would present.  It was just simply that I knew the score.  I was a passive party here, with a job to do.  And I would be informed as to what that job was and I would do it without question.

I was correct.

Jack very simply explained to me that I needed to convince my sister and her husband to take a camping trip.  It did not matter where, as long as the forest was thick and dark.  Furthermore, I must convince them to bring their daughter Jessie.

I did it.  I knew, and I did it.  In fact it was even worse than that. The moment I heard the request, everything fell into place.  I realized immediately that my old high school friend Tony had lost his child almost exactly a year before Hunter went missing.  I knew that Jessie was next in line for the same fate, and that this might continue forever, in a never ending chain of parental despair unless someone stopped the cycle.

I truly hope that someday, someone will.  Until then I live for my beautiful growing boy. My heart.  My love.  My soul.

<TITLE> He Rides Upon the Storm </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-18 07:38:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It was August 23rd when the storm came. That chaos that pummeled the earth and altered my life forever arrived amidst a sense of such peace, that I will forver consider it to be inherently evil.

I was only twelve years old at the time, running amok amongst the trees outside the cabin we had rented a week previous.  I recall tearing through the woods, ducking from tree to tree, trying to escape the site of my little sister, Sasha.  We had made a game of this that lasted days.  Despite her size and the age difference, I could never seem to lose her no matter how fast or skillful I was.

Typically this would have been the type of game that my parents would have guided me to avoid, expressing that it was cruel to try to evade my sister.  Today however, and this week in general, they had been acting in a rather peculier manner. Looking back I can now understand my juvenile observations and know that there was a certain strange tenseness between them on this night.  I recall them frequently ducking around a corner and speaking intently to one another in hushed tones.  I recall specifically at one point my parents putting their hands upon eachother's matching tattoos, and my father bowing his head and weeping.  I just stood there, worried and unsure at the sight of my father being so emotional.  It was unlike him.  It was also unlike both of them to invite our uncle Jack to a holiday part, nevermind a two week vacation.  Yet there he was, sitting on the porch cleaning his collection of guns.

I got very excited that evening when the sun began to set behind the mountain rainge in the distance.  This was the night that we were slated to have the bon fire we had been piling wood for, for so very long.  The warmth of that fire was a wondeful backdrop to the evening with my parents who began to recount tales of our youonger selves, and continiually inform my sister and myself of how proud they were of us.  I felt somewhat uncomfortable as the love being doled out reached a certain level, but I was happy in my heart, as I was warm in the smoke filled summer air.

Then it began, with a thundering, shaking and an unmistakable crack of lightnening over the lake in the canyon below us.  My mother shot from her log like a bowstring at that noise, and my father raised to pull her back to her seat with a strange, watchful protection.  He began scanning the area around us as he comforted my mother.

"Dad, what's the matter? It's just a storm. We can go inside" worried about the tension in our little family.

"Just stay close." I heard as he continued to scan our permiter.

Stay close. I immediately turned to relay that information to my sister, only to find an empty bench at my side.  She was suddently gone and I panicked. I jumpted and turned only to just barely glimpse her behind a nearby tree.

"You don't lose me!" she whispered adventurously.

I immediately knew that she had not heard our father, or caught onto the clear concern that our parents had at the moment, and I ran to grab her. Before I reached her she had managed another few feet into the woods, and then another.

The light summer rain began to fall.  Then it began to pour.  I shouted at my sister to stop where she was, telling her it was serious.  That worked and she stopped dead, looking worried.

I told her that Mom and Dad were worried and that we needed to get back to the fire immediately.  Within seconds I was shouting through a torrential rain, howling wind and snapping cracks of lightening all around us.

I went to grab her hand, and was stopped by her wide staring eyes.

"We have to go!" I shouted.

Her eyes only got wider, and her mouth hung open.  I realized that she was not looking at me, but behind me.  I felt my chest cave in, like a black hole had formed in my solar plexus, as I turned and backed towards my sister.  It was as if I knew we had a guest and I wanted to stand by her side to greet them, or prepare for what they would bring.

This guest was a nothing more than a black figure agaist the lightening-filled sky.  He seemed present in moments of flashing and nothing but dead space in the suddenly pitch dark between.  I recall him standing almost nine feet, though I question whether my percetion of height was skewed at this age. The tall thin man stood maybe five feet from us and began to stoop and draw closer.

I held my sister around the shoulder and stood petrified, solid and unmoving.  I simply knew that there was no moving, that it was not a viable option.  It truly almost never entered by mind as a possibility.  The only choice I partook in was to hold my sister strongly as the man reached out to us.

It seemed like he had moved perhaps one foot closer to us.  He reached out his hand, and his arm seemed to extend further and further toward us.  I could feel the forest bending around us, and started feeling extremeley nauseous as it's hands reached us both.

When the icy, black, clawed fingertips reached the necks of my sister and myself simultaneously, the man was suddenly there, directly in front of us.  Then the lightening increased in frequency, as we both yelped from the pain of those ragged claws penetrating the skin at the bottom of our necks, and we fell to the ground, beginning to losing consciousness.

But I did not black out until after I heard the voice of that man, that creature, that monster.

"Ten Years" it escaped his whole body like wind being tunneled through reeds.

Then eveything was black.

When we woke, and my sister and I did actually awaken simultaneously, all was white.  We were in a hospital room.  We soon learned that there had been an intense storm, and it had torn our small cabin from the mountain-face and into the lake.  No bodies had been recovered but our parents were missing.  It took almost an entire year before our Great Aunt, who cared for us afterwards, began to admit that our parents and uncle Jack were almost certainly dead.

That storm came from nowhere it seemed, and wreaked havoc on our lives.  It took everything from Sasha and I.  It left one thing and one thing only.

It left a small black mark at the top of the crest of our collarbones, at the base of the front of our necks.  And this mark matched the tattoos that my parents had shared for our entire childhood, in exact detail.

I am twenty-two now.  Sasha and I left our families 30 days ago, to spend a month in the stone farmhouse we are now fortifying for the coming storm.  We both knew it was coming.  We both started having the dreams months ago.

The Dream was always the same. There was this shape in front of an enormous storm.  He was thick and muscular, but had wings spreading from his sides, and a sectional tail as thick as it's legs poising and positioning behind him.  His eyes glowed amber-yellow and he said only one thing.

"Come to Me. Pazuzu will have you." It would howl.

Tonight is August 22nd. Tonight we will sleep, we must.  Tomorrow, the storm comes. It comes for us both. </TEXT>

<TITLE> One Bad Night on The Road </TITLE>

<TEXT> Have you ever seen the episode of "It's always sunny in Philadelphia" where they ask a sailor how he lost his hand expecting a good sea-fearing story only to find out that it was diabetes?   That always made me laugh, even before losing my hand.  Now it's even more so with the added irony that I actually have an excellent story if anyone is ever comfortable enough to ask me.

I'm Laura Davis. I'm 26 years old this month, and I'm a survivor.  Some of you may have heard about me in news last year, but I refused to do any interviews and ensured that my name was kept from public record.  I'm not interested in being known, or even in recounting the awful event that gained me public acknowledgement.  I am however interested in sharing this story with the young, seemingly helpless population.  I want you to know that unless you choose it, you are not a victim.  Facing anything, and choosing not to be victimized will lead to two possibilities.  Death and survival.  Either is preferable to victim-hood, so when faced with insurmountable odds, you fucking fight tooth and nail.  Win or die trying, but never, ever lay down.

That night was so dark.  Beyond the fact that there was only the slightest shiver of a new moon in the sky.  Besides the fact that I was speeding through Kentucky in the middle of nowhere.  The incredibly thick claustrophobic clouds had wrapped the area in a cold, dark embrace through the day and into the night.

I was doing about seventy miles and hour, and pounding my palm against the steering wheel to an old Joy Division CD I had burnt for this trip.  They always reminded me of Erin.  I could picture the times I had had hanging at her apartment back in High School as I screamed along to the track.  I could almost taste the Jack Daniels that had always been her go-to drink, and I couldn't wait to see her.  It had been almost ten years and for a moment I imagined tasting the Jack on her lips again.  I bit mine, and punched the gas.

I managed another two hours like this, before sleep started to overtake me.  I had had it mind to try to do the trip in one straight shot, but it had been over nine hours so far and I had barely slept the night before. After the nodding started, I decided that I would definitely need to get some shut-eye before continuing to my destination.  I considered finding a cheap roadside motel somewhere, but I hated the idea of spending $60 just to get a few hours of sleep.  I could find much better things to do with that money, and ever since I lost my last job things were pretty tight.

I finally decided to pull into the next rest stop, kick my seat back and sleep for a while, then continue on. It was a while until I found one and there were several instances of highway hypnosis before then.  I pulled up feeling relieved that the danger was over.  Silly me.

I pulled up to the small convenience store just before closing.  I rummaged through the trunk of my car to locate my toothbrush and paste from my luggage, and cleaned up in the store's restroom after buying a pack of cigarettes.

I decided to move my car to the far edge of the rest stop, so that I wouldn't be kept awake by all the lights, and also to try to prevent me from being seen by workers, or police officers that might happen by.  Once there I eased my seat back, covered myself in a sweatshirt and fell asleep pretty quickly.

It was only and hour or two before I shot up, as if shocked back to waking life by some sound, though I don't remember actually hearing anything.  I did however see something that was immediately disturbing.  Directly in front of my vehicle were two Mac trucks, parked cab to cab, their trailers at a ninety degree angle blocking my view.  Panicked I turned around as I put my fingers on the keys in the ignition, only to find that there was a third truck behind me.  The three of them had my vehicle completely penned in. There was no space to exit this trap.

Swearing profusely I grabbed my cell phone from the console and started to open my phone app to dial 911.  This was no joke, and I knew that this was not right and that I was in real danger. 

Crack!

I was stunned, half deaf and reeling from shock before I had any understanding of what had just happened.  I bent my head down and put my hands to me ears.  I saw my cell phone, now a tangle of chips and shattered gorilla glass on the floor of the car in front of me.  Looking up I saw a dime sized hole and spidering cracks in my windshield.

"That!" The voice blasted from in front of my car.

I saw the man, holding a bullhorn and standing the the roof of the cab of his truck.  He was dirty, oily, bearded and slightly overweight.  Your traditional trucker type.

"That, is the last time anyone will use a firearm tonight." His tone sounded like someone announcing a monster truck rally.

I ducked lower in my seat, not trusting the promise of discontinued shooting, not trusting any of this.

"You have seven hours until sunrise, missy." he spat. "It's real simple.  We won't enter your vehicle. There will be no more shooting.  If you get out of this area, you win and we leave.  If the sun rises and you're still in here, we get back to shooting, it's over for you."

I sat and listened. There was no point in doing otherwise.

"Now you have a good night now, missy." He climbed down from the roof, threw the bullhorn into his cab and climbed in after it.  

I never saw the man's face.  It was dark, and he had held the bullhorn for the entire time he was speaking.  I knew that there must be others, so I started to examine my surroundings.  I could just barely make out that each man was in his cab.  They seemed to be wearing masks, but all three of them were just sitting calmly in their respective driver's seats.

"Fuck, fuck fuck!"

I started looking around me, looking for anything that might help.  Anything I could use as a weapon, but there was nothing.  Loose change, CD's pens, a coffee cup, nothing helpful at all.

Then I looked ahead, where the two cabs of the trucks in front of me met and started thinking.  I felt like if I could get some decent speed I might be able to ram my car through them, pushing them aside and squeeze out.  That seemed like my best bet.  They had even said that they would not enter my car, so if that was true, and even if I didn't make it I might still be safe while I figure out other options.

Without another though I turned the key.

Nothing.  Dead silence, not even that clicking noise.  Thy must have disabled my car while I was asleep.  There was nothing for it.  I just needed to get my body out of this space.

I continued to look around at the men in the trucks, making entirely sure that they were all still in place in their cabs.  One of them had even pulled a stetson hat over his mask as if he were taking a nap.  Fucker.

I weighed about 112 pounds at the time, had run track in school, and marathons after graduation.  I was in really decent shape.  These guys were older, overweight and sloppy.  I started thinking that my absolute best bet was an immediate push.  Just fling the door open, book it towards one of the trailers and slide underneath toward the woods or toward the lit up store.  In the end, I decided that I would run straight towards and under the trailer in which I could see the napping trucker. It seemed like my best bet.

I put my hand on the door handle and started breathing fast, pumping up my adrenaline. Withing seconds I was halfway there, running full tilt and getting prepared to throw my body under that truck.  I saw the door swing open to my right, but ignored it, just completely focused on the dead center of the trailer.  

Suddenly I felt like I had slammed my arm on something I had not seen, and spun in pain.  I raised my right hand as I turned to see that it was completely missing, blood pumping from the stump at my wrist.  I fell backward, hard onto my spine.  Over me I saw a man in denim overalls, donning a clown mask, holding a machete in his right hand, and my hand in his left.  He raised it up like a trophy and turned to the other two men who were now surrounding the area that I had been heading for.

I knew my time was limited, I picked myself up and bolted back to the car.  They didn't even bother chasing me, too wrapped up in hooting and shouting and playing with the piece of me that they had managed to steal.  I had kept my left hand clamped hard on my wrist, and even manged to shut the car door without letting go.  I knew I needed to make a tourniquet however, and only had one hand to do so.  Luckily I happen to be left handed.

I managed to get my shoes off, and even lift my shoe up into my lap using only my feet.  I used my arms, while still clamping my right wrist, to raise the shoe to my face and over what seemed like ten full minutes, I had the shoe lace off of the shoe completely. With only minimal fumbling I managed to get the shoelace around my wrist three times, knot, and tighten it solidly without losing too much more blood.  I knew I was successful when the pumping stopped, and I immediately passed out from the pain and shock.

I shot forth from the blackness of unconsciousness like a wolf charging from a dark wood.  I gasped and shot upright, and somehow had this immense focus and energy.  It was a damn good thing too because by the looks of it I had been our for hours and dawn was clearly on it's way. I wanted these bastards dead, and there was only one thing for it. To determine how I could take them out.

I was hit by a spark of inspiration. I turned and climbed into the back, and unlatching the seat I gained access to the trunk.  Using my good, remaining hand I started pulling everything from the trunk, and frantically opening my luggage, rummaging through bags, and spreading everything I had at my disposal into view.  My right wrist ached like it had been turned to hot stone, but I tried to ignore the pain and focus on a plan.

The plan began to form, and quickly.  Out of everything I had, I grabbed three things and began my preparation.  Once done I scanned my surroundings to see that each and every driver was at their respective cabs, this time outside and ready.  I grabbed my gear and took action.

I bolted from the car just as before, headed straight for one of the three trucks, near the center of the trailer, but this time a bit nearer the cab.  The man at that cab yelped a good 'ol southern battle cry and headed for me with his baseball bat.

He swung. I ducked.  Then I rose and sprayed him directly in the eyes with the brake cleaner that my ex had left in my trunk months ago.  I kept spraying until it was clear that the man was entirely rehabilitated and the clear liquid build-up was dripping from his face and hands, as he tried to shield his eyes from more pain.

I turned swiftly, knowing that the next attack would be from behind and barely missed another swing of the machete that had stolen my hand from me.  I darted past the swing behind his bulky frame, reaching into my jacket pocket.

I pulled and threw the liquid-filled condom at him, bursting over his upper body, and immediately reached back into my pocket.  He swung again before I was able to dodge and the blade caught my right shoulder.  That arm was dead anyway.  I had no need for it.

The blow did take me to the ground however, but I managed to get the lighter out just as he was bearing down upon me, now bare handed with the clear intention to strangle me.  I flicked the lighter, and in moments he was a dervish of flame, twisting, turning, screaming and running directly away from me as I lifted myself off of the ground.

The cleaner spray, and the condom filled with nail polish remover were my last and only weapons. I did however bend down and grab the machete from in front of me.  I turned and saw the final attacker about seven feet from me, staring.  

I smiled.  I casually walked straight toward him, eyes locked and my smile getting wider with each foot.

I've never seen 300 pounds in overalls run so quickly in my life.  He was the lucky one. As much as I wanted it, I did not have it in my to chase that redneck rabbit.  I walked cautiously to the convenience store and smashed the glass storefront, setting off the alarms and alerting the police.

To this day I don't know what happened to my hand.  It was not found at the scene and I can only imagine that rabbit has it.  Fucking rabbit took my hand.  

So that's my story.  Like I said before, I'm sharing it to put one message out there.  You are not to be fucked with.  The only person that can kill you, is you.  Let fear overtake you, and you've already lost.

There is one more lesson here that I've not shared.  It's a tricky one. I cannot say too much about it, But the lesson is this: It is never over.  

It's been one year since that night, and tonight, I'm heading out in the very same car.  I'm driving to Kentucky.  And I'm coming home with rabbit for dinner. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was out in the woods behind my house today and I came to a realization. I realized that I have a story to tell.  In fact I've held this particular story for some time, almost thirty years now.  However, I did not know that I had a tale to share until very recently.  I had always assumed that this memory must have been a nightmare that I had as a child, and remembered it as a real waking experience as often happens in childhood.  We do not fully learn to  distinguish between the internal and external experiences until a certain age.  

I was six. 

I was camping with my parents in the Finger Lakes if I remember correctly. We had arrived later than expected but with enough time to setup camp and get a nice warm dinner fire going well before sundown.  It was a special time.  My father had just arranged a rather large business deal and he and my mother never seemed so happy or in love.  Their cheer spread and I remember sitting by that fire with the internal warmth of one's most meaningful memories.

After dinner I was told that we had an hour before sundown and that I was allowed to roam freely as long as I could still see our tent.  This was my invisible curtain, and I was a master at pushing the boundaries.  The limitation was instantly transformed into a challenge in my mind.  I walked and walked, weaving through the woods around the camp, but always keeping the most slight, distant sliver of the tent in my vision. I was finally as far as I could go. I pushed my back against a thick pine and peeked around it ever so slightly, satisfied that I was as remote and hidden as possible from my parents without breaking their rule.  That's when I first heard that voice.

"Hey. Hey you." in a hushed throaty shout.

I turned toward the direction that the voice came to find nothing.  I spun a full three hundred and sixty degrees two times trying to pick up sight of the owner of that voice to no avail.  I peered up into the trees, not knowing what reason there would be for a man to sit up there, but still searching.

"Down here, boy." with slight urgency. 

I looked down at the ground in that direction and saw him, the man in the earth.  In front of me was a hole in the rich black soil, about the diameter of two adult fists.  In this hole was was the face of a man looking directly up at me.  His skin was charcoal, complete with minuscule cracks in his skin and a strange light behind them.  His eyes were a odd sickly grey color, as if someone had plucked them from his head and let them soak in black tea.  He was bald, and his white teeth stood out like my socks would under a black light.

"Hello!" It said up to me, with a great welcoming smile.

"Um. Hello" I believe was my response, nervous but polite.

"I'm happy you came.  I need your help.  Would you like to be able to help me?" brows raised.

"Sure." I was clearly noncommittal.

The entire scene was so unreal it caused some shift in my forming mind.  This was like nothing that had ever happened, but the proper responses in this scenario were obvious.  They say hello and you return the greeting.  Would I like to help? Sure I would like to help.

"I am burning under the sun.  Would you pile some sticks and give me some shade?"

Realizing that maybe his face being so dark was a product of this very issue I hurried to begin piling sticks and small branches, eventually blocking the low setting sun from the man's face.  His eyes followed me as I moved around the area to collect material, and his mouth hung open in an excited expression.  I was very careful to not get too close to his face, feeling a bit uneasy.  At no point did the face do anything that alarmed me, and once I was finished I felt a bit more settled.

"Ah, much better!" The face exclaimed.  A few inches to the right of the hole that held this man's head I saw the earth start to move.  Soon pebbles were tumbling from the top of a small but growing hill.  Then small earthworm colored protuberances began to pop out from the mound.  Soon a full sized, dirty hand was above the ground, and it was holding something small.

"This is to thank you for helping me."

I looked closer without getting too much closer to either his face or hand.  The hand was holding a shark's tooth.  Two weeks previous to this trip I had lost this item from a necklace that I had purchased with my own money at Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut.  I was sad and had a sinking feeling in my stomach every time I recounted the loss.  Here it was in front of me. My eyes lit up, and my mouth dropped as I lost all sense of fear and gently took the item from the hand.

"It's mine! Thank you!" I said ecstatically.  I noticed the particular shape of the tooth edge as exactly matching the one I had had.

"You're very welcome young man. You are very kind.  I wonder if you would be so kind as to do one more thing for me?"

"Sure!"

"Would you get me a cup of water from that creek to your left?"

I agreed, and quickly located a large leaf which I cupped and used to carry a bit of water to the man.  I was nearly back when I began to imagine having to feed the face in the ground.  The idea of putting my hands so close to his mouth started making me feel uncomfortable about the situation again.

"Aim it.  Close your eyes and I will open my mouth wide.  Pour it with your eyes closed and then step back, opening them."

I was relieved that I did not need to get too close.  I did as he asked, moving closer, but not too close. Closing my eyes in this situation made me very anxious but I did as asked, and then slowly poured the water.  When I opened my eyes I saw, for a split second, blackness in the hole.  Then the face snapped back into place instantly and the man smiled again with big wide eyes and thanked me.

There was an uncomfortable silence which I decided to break.

"Can I help you out of that hole?" I inquired, feeling generous and helpful.

"Oh!" the face became overwhelmed with joy. "Would you? I only need one thing."

"Ok" I prompted.

"Just go get your mother and being her here.  She can help me."

"Oh." I was slightly disappointing that it seemed like I could not help and needed a parent to do the job.

"Yes, it's very easy, just tell her that you found something amazing. Don't tell her what it is.  Perhaps you could tell her that it's the most beautiful crystal you've ever seen and you need her help to get it."

The suggestion seemed like a good way to get my mother to come here.  I realized that telling her the truth would simply not work, that she would probably not believe me.

"Go now! before it get's dark. If you're mother comes I will be able to get out. Help me, and I have another wonderful present for you!"

"Ok." I replied hesitantly. 

I turned and headed back to that sliver of orange between the trees.  As I walked, it became bigger, more real, more like the real world.  The face behind me started to feel less real, like it was a dream I was walking away from back into regular life.  Step by step, my mind pushed the experience aside, as "other", as something I should stop thinking about.  

By the time I reached the tent, I had decided that I should not lie to the smiling face of my mother.  I decided that nothing would happen if I simply stopped helping him now.  I decided to stop thinking about the man in the earth completely, although the memory of this incident has stayed with me throughout my life.

Later in life I never told anyone of this, never shared it.  I had in fact decided that it was some kind of false memory, a dream, the product of a fever, or a hallucination from banging my head in the woods.  Logic took over and my mind and fit this into the most realistic category possible and segregated it from "the real world".

That is, until tonight, almost thirty years later after I cut a small poison ivy bush from the woods behind me home.  Until my seven year old son Jacob ran up to me and asked:

"Dad! Can you come help me.  I found an awesome huge crystal in the back yard! Help me pull it out!"

I lead him back into the house immediately, and drew the truth from him amidst his tears and apologies for lying.  I have never let him stray from my side in the woods since that day, and never will. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Lucid Gifts from The Dream Lands </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-30 06:25:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello Everyone! I'm a long time Reddit lurker but rarely post.  I am posting here today because I need some advice and want to share the incredible experiences I've been having lately..  I have no way to convince you of the truth of what I'm going to tell you, and it is, on the surface, quite unbelievable.  Nonetheless, I need help and advice about what to do and I do hope that the excellent people in this subreddit can help me figure out my next move.

Funny enough, this all started when I stumbled on a post by a user called "Magus_Somnia" on the /r/luciddreaming sub-reddit.  Don't bother looking for either the user or the post, I have spent weeks trying to track down the original post or poster after the first time I read it about a month ago.  I only have what I recall as being the content of the post which is not by any means complete.

I had been reading, researching and practicing Lucid Dreaming methods for about a year before stumbling unto that particular post.  At first things were very slow going.  I would try a new method every few weeks and have limited or no success. I would focus on the method that gave me any results whatsoever no matter how small and try to get better at it.  For some reason this never worked.  If a method such as "WILD" would work and make me Lucid for a moment before immediately waking, it would always happen that way in the future.  No matter how much I practiced I would always awaken when reaching lucidity.

Needless to say this was very frustrating.  After months of trying to develop one method or another I decided that I simply need to try other methods until I found the one that worked  for me immediately and consistently.  The hunt was on!  It took quite a long time, lots of research and many strange nights filled with broken fitful sleep but I finally located a method that worked perfectly.

It was strange, because the method did not come from any material about Lucid Dreaming at all.  After spending six months reading so much literature on the subject by many authors, posters, etc. I ended up locating my perfect method because I was browsing around about a movie documentary.  I had just seen "Jodorowsky's Dune", which was excellent, and I realized how little I actually knew about Salvador Dali's life.  For those that don't know, Dali was to be the actor playing the Emperor in this rendition of Dune.

As I was reading about Dali I stumbled across a mention of an exercise that he used to perform to enter a hypnotic state.  He would sit in a comfortable chair holding a spoon over a metal bowl.  As he would begin to nod off he would drop the spoon which would then would clatter in the bowl and wake him up. This would keep him constantly between sleep and wakefulness which he would use to draw and paint his dream images.

It was approximately three months ago when I tried this method for the first time. It was immediately effective for me.  Usually around the third spoon drop I would "awaken" in the dream rather than in waking life and instantly become entirely and solidly lucid.

I was ecstatic about the incredibly reliable results and not a night passed without my practicing this method. This went on for months.

At night I would fly.  Everything was at my fingertips in my dreams and I could create almost anything I desired for myself. I would go on grand adventures, live beneath the oceans, leave for the stars, and every day I would awaken refreshed and excitedly planning the next night's journey. 

I did not have complete control regardless of my seemingly endless abilities.  I was always able to call things into existence and control my body, but foreign elements would always present themselves regardless of my design. Mostly these were people and animals, along with the environments that I would discover when traveling.

 I never truly became bored, but I did begin to wonder what else I could accomplish in this realm.  I was pleased with my accomplishments and knew that with patience and diligence I would be able to find some way to take it even further. 

It was then, reading through the Lucid Dreaming sub-reddit that I came across that fateful post.  Magus_Somnia posted a short article claiming that he had devised a method by which dreamers could pull an item from their dream into the real physical world. His method was to call a pen, marker or paintbrush into the dream and draw five symbols, one on each fingertip  of your right hand. You would then grab the object in the dream tightly and wake yourself as sharply as possible.

I immediately blew off the idiocy of the claim.  I may treasure Lucid Dreaming but I am not any sort of crystal worshiping alien abductee type. Dreams were internal and psychological.  The premise was simply absurd and I put it aside at once. 

Clearly though, some part of me must have held onto the idea. 

That night as I was exploring the rich world that I had found after tunneling deep below a strange tree in my neighbor's back yard, it happened.  Before I knew what I was doing, I had raised my hand to the sky (in this case, the luminescent ceiling of a deep but brightly lit cave) and called down a Japanese paintbrush from the sky.  Though I was lucid I felt that my actions were being carried out without my full intentional will.  They occurred swiftly and without thought.  I drew the symbols I had seen in the post upon my fingers, watching as they glowed and shifted, as did my hands. Once complete I could sense this heat and heaviness from my right hand as if I were carrying a heavy molten hammer.

The sensation was beginning to become overwhelming so I quickly scanned my environment.  My eyes found themselves upon a white stone, smooth and slightly translucent similar to quartz.  I shot my hand from my side grabbing the stone and twisted my body quickly. I screamed as loud as I could while turning my body into a tornado of chaos.  A great intense light filled my eyes overtaking the landscape and blinding me.

Thump!

"Fuck" I murmured, pushing myself up from the floor.

It seemed that I had thrown myself out of the chair upon which I had fallen asleep.  My vision was blurry and my head muddled. I started to stand and was beginning to realize that something was wrong. My eyes were not adjusting, everything still seemed very blurry and reddish.  

When I looked down, I leaned two things.

First as I saw the blood spilling onto the floor in front of me I learned that I was injured and bleeding quite profusely.  It seemed that I had cut my forehead in the tumble.

Secondly I learned what I had hit my head upon.  Through the glaze and swoon I saw to my right, resting upon the floor, a white quartz-like stone with a red stain on the side. 

Unfathomable as it is, the method had worked.  I had grabbed hold of an object in my dream and brought it back to me in the waking world.  The implications of this were staggering and the experience was all mine.

I spent that night in the emergency room.  It turns out that I needed twelve stitches in my forehead along with a barrage of testing.  After a questioning, neurological testing, a CT scan and hours ensuring that I was no longer nauseous after the stitches were in, they sent me on my way with a clean bill of health.  I did not even really consider the injury or experience the frustration or pain regarding the injury.  I was too busy considering what had happened at home and what I would make of it with time.

I was sitting outside in a wheelchair waiting for my sister to pick me up when the worry struck me.  I realized suddenly that I had just had a moderate to severe head wound, after a semi-hypnotic practice.  Logic told me that the most likely scenario was that I had simply hallucinated the stone based upon my experience and expectation.  I became quiet in the car, depressed and worried that I would return home to find this to be the case.

I hurriedly left my sister's care and transport to find myself moving full speed to my den. I dropped to my knees smiling as I lifted the heavy, solid, real stone to my face.  In my relief I noticed something strange.  I have always had a very intense sense of smell.  As a child I would frequently tell my mother that there was a fire, only to find out later that my father had passed one on the way home from work miles away.  It was frequently a very annoying ability to have and lead me to being an extremely fastidious person, since the odor of day old food stuffs would intrude on me throughout the house.  

The point is, this stone had no smell.  And I understand that you will likely say that stones don't smell like anything. This is simply not true.  While stones do not have an overpowering or distinctive odor, there is always a strong trace of their original environment.  Whether it be a moist thick earthy forest, or dry desert sands, stones carry an odor.  This one did not.  This item had no smell whatsoever and frankly it disturbed me deeply.  

My trepidation took control of my excitement and I decided to simply go to sleep.  Normal sleep.  I spent the next day pondering the situation and my options.  You would think that spending an entire day deciding on what to do would result in something more,  but the result was strikingly simple, and honestly pretty silly.

That night, the spoon dropped and the sound rung in my ears as I opened my "eyes" to see the city around me.  I did my best to expect to experience this as if it were New York where I had been as a child, full, and teaming with people and businesses.  I was not able to conjure the amount of people to match even a small city, but the buildings, stores and houses were reasonable facsimiles.

I walked until I found what I was looking for, the bank.  It was large, cold, marble, and empty.  I strode right back behind the counter and headed toward the vault.  On my way I did see one man in the back offices of the bank.  He looked like a classical banker with his pin striped suite and greasy black hair.  He simply stood erect behind the window of his office, openly and penetratingly starting at me as I moved.  I watched his eyes follow me as I made my way. Once inside the vault I began pulling safety deposit boxes and after what seemed like a minute I had a stack of hundred dollar bills about as tall has I could hold with my one hand.

Just like the first time, I called a brush into existence, painted the symbols upon my ever changing finger tips, grabbed the stack of cash, and jolted myself awake screaming and twisting.  I knew that this time I would not be severely injured, had I again landed head first onto my treasure.  It seemed that I had gotten better at waking and remained in my chair with a small jolt.

I looked down and found my hand absolutely full of bills and leapt off of my seat in excitement. I jumped and shook them over my head, the sense of triumph overtaking me.  I would never have to work again, I would be rich and setup for life. No one could possibly take this away from me ever.

Then I took a closer look. The bills were green and patterned and at first glance appeared like a stack of 100's.  The "100" in the corners was clear and distinct and the entire design looked generally acceptable.  But the face of Benjamin Franklin was strange and incorrect.  The text of his name, as well as all other text on the bills were blurry and unreadable.  This was more like an impressionist painting of money, perfectly reasonable from a yard away but an obvious mess in the close light.

"Shit."  It was clear that while the trick had worked, my mind had simply not created a fully detailed and realistic impression of the bills in the dream.  And here I was with the result.  A stack of bills that looked as if I had drawn them from memory.  In the end I burnt them in my fire pit out back.  They were useless and additionally likely to get me arrested as the worlds worst counterfeiter ever, if found.

My next plan came to fruition quickly.  Clearly identifying the issue regarding cash lead me to this idea which I had actually already vetted and proved possible. If I could produce a passable stone, then I could certainly produce gold.  I needed to do this with something simple, not overly complex and gold seemed the perfect solution.  At first I was envisioning gold bars, still thinking about the bank.  Over time though when I began picturing myself walking into the nearest "Cash for Gold" storefront with a $500,000 bar, I changed my plan.

I needed to start small, but I also needed simplicity of shape and composition.  Something that would be quite clear in my mind when I was dreaming.  I decided on a gold wedding ring.  It was simple, easily envisioned and pervasive as a symbol.  Aside from that it would be very easy to sell.

The plan went without a hitch, just like the night previous.  I decided that using the city and bank were still viable and that it would be best to repeat that scenario, simply expecting the safety deposit box to contain a wedding ring.  The only difference in the entire experience this evening is that when I got behind the counter of the bank there were 5 offices, each with the shades open, and in each office were two bankers staring directly at me with wide strange smiles on their faces.  

I stopped for a moment and looked back, examining them.  Their smiles seemed to grow slightly as if they were pleased that I was paying attention to them.  They leaned in and stared even more thoroughly as I made my way into the vault.

Strange as that was, dreams are always this way even when you have some semblance of control. I proceeded quickly, found a wedding ring as expected, returned and was very pleased.  

I had done it.  I was holding a perfect, round gold ring in my hand, in my den, in the harsh light of reality.  The next morning I was able to sell it without a hitch and walked home with $350.  I was convinced that this was the method I would stick with, especially when I learned from the clerk that the gold was 24 karat.  

I simply couldn't sleep that night and instead did some research.  It turned out that there was a gold bar much smaller than the ones you see in the movies, called a kilobar.  The kilobar is used in investment and seemingly more common than it's larger counterpart.  In fact it was very common for survival types to buy and store these to use as currency if the monetary system broke down.  I had another plan, and even a believable story for the pawn shop.  I would tell them that my crazy uncle had been a "prepper" and had a cache of these kilobars buried under his shed when he passed away and left the property and belongings to me.

I still found myself unable to sleep that day and decided to wait until the next evening before proceeding. I spent my time studying the images of these kilobars and practicing imaging them in my mind.  Luckily, even though most are stamped, there are blank kilobars out there. When the next night came everything began perfectly smoothly for the third time in a row.  

Except for one thing.

When I entered the bank, there was no counter.  There were no offices.  It was a huge empty marble shell with none of the previous accouterments.  This was odd but I was also a bit relieved that I did not have to deal with the bankers staring at me from the back offices as I walked toward the open vault.  They were really unnerving, though they had made no move toward me or showed any signs of malice.

I entered the vault, pulled drawers and eventually had a six inch high stack of kilobars on the table. I called my brush, painted my fingers and turned to pick up the bars only to find the bars, and the table completely missing from the now empty vault.  Shocked, I looked out of the vault door to the main area of the bank to see an incredibly frightening scene.

There must have been thirty of those bankers in the main area, each staring, smiling impossibly widely and completely transfixed on me.  The ones in the center of the group began to drift slowly and smoothly to either side.  

Then I saw the Beast.

Behind these men was a two foot high mass of snarling, bucking, black dripping muscle and chaos.  The thing shook the room with it's very presence and it's red eyes fixed upon me quickly.  I could hear the words in my head in a guttural soul-shaking tenor.

"Prey.  Door."

It tore at me full speed emitting a sound like a pack of wolves fighting tooth and nail. It was faster than I would have imagined possible, on me in a split-second.  I could only react.  

It's face, if you can call it that, was in mine instantly as I was pinned to the ground.  I instinctively grabbed it's head to keep it from biting me, though I only saw it's razor sharp pitch black teeth after the fact.  It writhed, and twisted and seemed to change shape in my arms as I let out an intense scream and turned to attempt to throw it from my person.

I awoke.

I awoke at the hospital in incredible pain and confusion, partially due to the morphine.  I had been found by my sister who had come to pick me up and bring me to work.  I had been on the floor, on top of the shattered remains of my chair bleeding and unconscious.  I had three broken ribs, several fractures and contusions galore.  The police had said that it seemed like a wild animal, likely a buck, had managed to gain entry into my home, attack me in my sleep and exit by crashing through my back patio doors which were now completely destroyed.

I know better.

I did it.

I brought something out of a dream into our waking world.

I brought a nightmare.

God help us. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Snake Man Came to Us </TITLE>

<TEXT> Grandfather has a story to tell.  He is very old and does not know how to use a computer so I am helping to share his story.  I will type everything he says and I hope that his story will pass dawn forever. The fire is lit and he begins.

++++++

I am an old man.

Once I was a young boy.

When I was a young boy I was very ill.  The sickness took my body. It took my mind.  But it was a blessing.  The spirit gave me eyes. Eyes to see. It was a gift.  

All gifts carry weight.  The gift gave me sight but I could not always see what was good.

I saw my father.  My father cared for rabbits and my father was rabbit.  He would duck and bolt and turn. My father had the rabbit spirit with him.  I could see it when trouble came.  When the law men came.  Danger would come and the rabbit would twist and turn.  The rabbit would escape swiftly. Then danger would go.

Many times this happened.  The guns came. The law men came many times.  Fires came.  Machines came and roads came. All times my father he escaped the danger.

As a child I was happy with the rabbits.  I played with the rabbits my father kept.  I watched my father happy and content.

But rabbits are not strong creatures, not proud creatures.

One day the Snake man came.

The snake man is sneaky.  He does not come with big danger.  Snake man is not big, does not capture your eyes.  The snake man came to our family like nothing, like a light wind.

But I saw it.  My blessing helped me see him.  

Snake man was a white man.  He wore desert colors and his face was between clean and bearded.  Snake man was thin and his body twisted. His eyes like the dead.  There was no life there, no fire. Worst I could see his animals.  My gift let me see those circling snakes beneath his clothing.  The Snake man was had by the snakes.  He was surrounded by them small and thin.

That day Snake Man came to our house.  He took our paper money and he gave a bottle to my father.  I yelled but my father scolded me.  I ran but he caught me and beat me. I yelled because I saw it.  I saw the snake come out of the sleeve of the Snake man and bite my father.  I saw the little snake sneak his way into my father's shirt.

It was a small snake.

It made my father angry. It made our house angry.  But every time my father drank from that bottle the little snake grew.  It moved more and more. I would see it crawling over his shoulder on his chest. I would see it wrap his neck. It grew and grew.

It killed our rabbits.  I found them dead and sickly looking.  I knew at once that the snake took them. Poisoned them.

I told my father. I told my mother.

"The snake man, he gave you the snakes." I said. "They killed the rabbits, they will kill you."

They did not listen.  The Snake Man came back again and again.  He brought bottles and he brought snakes.  I watched them grow as my father got more and more.

I would watch them play over his body when he shouted.  I could see them curl to strike when my father hit me.  The snakes owned the house now and I would hear them roam at night.  They would come for me.  But every time they did I would stomp my foot.  Stomp Stomp! It scared the snakes and kept them away.

The snakes bit my mother one night. I heard the scream and cries.  I knew they had gotten her.  She ran away crying that night and did not come home.  Our home was theirs, not hers.  She had no home.

I was a boy but I was strong.  I took a rock and prayed on it.  I walked to the crossing and waiting.  I knew the Snake man came this day and I would be a warrior.  He did come.  When he came I rose up and threw the rock.  I was quick and strong and I hit the Snake man hard.  He fell.

I was wrong to do this. He fell and the snakes fled.  I watched them as they fled to my house.  I chased them and yelled.  I tried throwing more rocks.  But the snakes were too fast and tricky.

I got home and the snake were on my father. I was too late. He was covered.  He shouted.  He was angry.  He shook me and asked me what I did.  He slapped me but I ran.  I ran like the rabbit.  I was in houses and out of houses. I was in the hills.

I sat there all night.  I tried to find the way.  I tried to be strong.  But I cried.  I was very young and I cried. I had no father. I had no home.  

Worst of all, when my father shook me he gave me one.  It was on me. I could feel it.  It was a baby but growing.  When I grew up it grew.  It took many things from me in my life. But I was careful.  I had only one and I kept it close.  I did not want to give my snake spirit to others. I keep it close so that I could dance with it when we both die.  

That time is close now. I am prepared to die.  But today I woke and my snake was gone.  It has become big and strong. It likes my family and it is gone. </TEXT>

So it's been a while, and things have really gotten away from me.  I want to apologize first.  I came here for help because I just didn't know what to do.  At this point things have changed.  I'm writing this final update for a very different reason than I started this, but I feel like I owe it to share the rest of what happened, and to be fair I have another motive now.

From the time of my last post things became intense but continued down the path I had begun.  I spent the rest of the time before the play enjoying what I had.  I spent the days and nights smoking, eating, drinking and fucking.  I lived like I had never lived before, in complete comfort and luxury. All of this was shared with Ella who moved into the apartment and shared time with me constantly. This became the status quo.

Ella had begun watching me and giving me pointers regarding my performance which was now occurring several times per day.  We were getting closer to the performance quickly and she was spending all of her time with me to improve my work.  After the incident when we were woken she started teasing me about a Spirit showing up after every performance.  Having had a tough time explaining some of the random events that kept happening after my work she would always be snarky.

"Oh, obviously the demon you just called started that lightening storm" or "Clearly your little pet turned out all the lights."

It was like that too. Every single time that week crazy shit would happen, over and over.  It became expected and honestly added a lot of fire to my performance.  There's nothing like a freak thunderstorm suddenly sweeping the city as a sound track to an occult based play.

Before I could even post one more update to this forum, the day had come.  In a blur of weed, sex, practice and luxury the time had come.  I remember waking up that morning after some truly crazy dreams and seeing Ella with an immense setup of breakfast food in the kitchen.  Believe it or not she wouldn't let me eat any.  In true strange, artsy Ella fashion she told me that the meal was a gesture, a good luck momento but that I should not detract from my focus by eating today.  We spent almost a half an hour sitting in front of the meal on the table, smelling the food, laughing and enjoying the way the spread looked.

As a thank you for understanding and another treat Ella spent another half an hour scrubbing me in the bath.  Seated behind me I remember her singing this tune in a very low voice.  It was not in English and when I asked what the tune was she said it was Sumerian. 

When I asked where she had picked it up I only got the reply "I learned it in Hell, from Zuul" in her very best guttural ghost-busters impersonation.

Regardless the hours flew just as the days had and when I voiced concern at D. not showing up, Ella told me that we should simply meet him there.

"There." was the oldest strangest cemetery I had ever seen.  It had long been abandoned but all of the original stone paths, gateways and walls were still present though worn and damaged in places. The forest surrounding the clearing was really amazing.  The statues that used to litter the cemetery had been enveloped by growing tress, and you would frequently see half of an angel statue, armed raised coming out from the side of the large oaks.

"That's you." Ella pointed to a large circle on the grass in the middle of the clearing. 

At first I thought that they had painted the circle and all the symbols on the grass, but as I got closer I found that it was different sands or powders that had been intricately laid out, almost like one of those Tibetan sand paintings.

I looked up at Bella, with the full moon behind her as she kissed me, approaching my face slowly with her eyes locked on mine.

I felt it immediately and my body tensed up.  There was something in her mouth that she was passing to me and it was very familiar.  Before I could place the feel of it she bit me hard on the lip drawing blood.  I started to react, but she just continued to kiss me harder until I relaxed.

When she was done I put my fingers in my mouth and pulled out a strip of five hits of paper acid.  I turned my eyes from the little star decorated stamps and looked at her questioningly.

"I love you. You're going to do great.  Take this." handing me a black strip of cloth. "Put it on and sit in the circle until you hear a bell ring.  Be careful not to disturb the circle they made you, and stay dead silent until that Bell. Once the bell rings you can take off the blindfold and begin the performance."

She turned and left me standing in an empty cemetery holding nothing but my own blindfold, scared about the immanent trip and confused about why she would dose me with so much LSD right before something like this.  As ridiculous as it was, I trusted her and did as I was asked, knowing that there must be a reason, and that it was in my best interest, somehow.

I sat down, tied the blindfold around my head tightly and completely, and sat.  For the first five minutes I was full of anxiety and could not stop thinking and stressing, hearing every creak of every branch around me. That began to pass and I started just focusing on my breath and preparing myself to perform.  Then the focus went away.  I was left just silent and dark.  The noises around me simply were.  They would come and pass, come and pass, like my thoughts.  At some point I felt like i was falling asleep, and began dreaming.  I would get these two second long scenes in my mind like walking through some alien landscape. I knew thought that i could not be falling asleep because by this point I started to feel that classic gripping intensity that happens when you take acid, and it's coming on strong.

 I must have sat like this, taking tours through my mind and vision as the trip began to intensify for what seemed like two hours. I was reeling, awash and afloat in myself. There was nothing outside me, I had no concept for the exterior world whatsoever, no idea where I was or what I was doing. Just endless black and endless potential.

"Ding." The vibration of the bell tore through me completely, splitting my mind like an axe but bringing only instantaneous clarity and focus.

I tore the blindfold from me eyes and rose in one second of perfect action.  When I realized that the entire cemetery was entirely and exceedingly empty I only smiled knowingly.  I knew what I was here for, what had lead me to this point in time.  I performed.

I performed with every bit of my being, leaving nothing back.  The monologue was my reality.  The circle glowed with amber, smoky light and rose from the grass, surrounding me.  I could feel the grass growing towards me ever so slightly as my mouth and person recited and emoted the content of the ritual.

And it was a ritual.

When I called the names inscribed in the circle it pulsed and expanded. When I called, the wind roared, a fiery ball glowed in the south, the creek behind me swelled, and in the north the earth shook. Glaring up at the heavens and demanding the light made the stars supernova before my eyes. They danced, and swirled and spun. When I knelt to the ground it rose up to meet me as my legs made their home under the soil.

I called upon the watchers and was awestruck by the multitude of light glowing orbs starting to fill the woods around me.  I saw them turn, some low and some high but all eyes on me.  That's when I noticed my own radiance. I was lighting the area and as I performed all light was coming to me, building up in my chest until I almost couldn't bear it.

"Byleth, I demand you presence in true form and with no ill intention.  Byleth, show yourself!"

He did.

Suddenly I heard a blast of trumpets and horns, settling into a full orchestra of energetic music which I can in no way describe to you.  My eyes began to weep at the incredibly foul smell that filled the air about me like burning hair and ammonia.  Keeping myself from fleeing the stench and leaving the circle I steeled myself and forced my eyes open.

Through the tears and confusion I saw the shape of a hooded man riding a pale horse.  Suddenly the image shifted, like turning a mirrored corner and I saw an enormous toad,  He was decked out with gold jewelry and holding a spear like a large thorned rose stem. The frog opened his mouth and turning inside out, became a panther. The head of the panther emerged from the toads throat and carried the former body into the new as it lept toward me.

"The man on the Horse!" I stated gruffly. Calming I repeated "Take the form of the man on the horse."  This was where I left the script completely knowing that from here on out it would be my show.

It did.

The man's eyes burned red as he stared down at me from this steed.  He stood silent.

I knew what to do.  I commanded he Daemon.  I convinced and put this creature under my command, fully.  That's why I was here.  That is why D. found me. That is why Ella trained me and lead me down this road.  I know that now.  This was a setup from the start aimed at me, but not against me.

D. and Ella, and the others who appeared after my work was complete.  They are nothing but love and power.  They want for nothing, yet work tirelessly for those around them who show promise.  They scour the sewers of the world and when they find potential, they nurture and develop it.

I am one of them now.  And we are many.  Many of us all around you.  Dressed like beggars and businessmen. Floating in and out of the most mundane of places.  We are true spiritual evolution, commanding forces beyond comprehension. 

This world is a play and are writers. 

Until the day we meet.

I slipped the key into the lock, and walked into an unbelievable apartment.  D.'s place was amazing inside even though it just looked like another Baltimore warehouse on the outside. This place was a capitalist dream with huge full wall-sized windows, granite counter tops, stainless steel everything and just clean modern lines everywhere.  

After taking a tour and checking out the bedroom and bathroom (most of the place was open space including the kitchen and main area) I checked the fridge.  I always got a bit hungry after drinking and this was no exception.  In the front of the top shelf of the fridge was a big covered dish which I grabbed and opened on the counter.

"Oh, Fuck yes!" I let out to the empty apartment.

The casserole dish was absolutely filled with the most beautiful looking bud I have ever seen.  There must have been 2 ounces of weed in there and I was smacked with that overwhelming smell of quality.  I didn't need an invitation, but there was a small business card with a note on it, stating simply "Help Yourself" with a pack of rolling papers affixed to the back.

I twisted one up, kicked back on the leather couch and looked out over the city for hours.  I was feeling beyond great, such a strange overwhelming happiness after the shit that happened earlier.  It's strange, this was clearly temporary, but I just felt like a King hanging in this ridiculous pad, all the bud I could smoke, food in the fridge.... and oh fuck!  A bathtub!

I leapt off the couch, made sure the door was locked and headed for the bathroom.  I can't remember the last time I took a bath.  The A-worx had a shower stall that used to be some sort of chemical wash station.  As you can imagine, it's not the most impressive or luxurious shower in the world, and the water was often brown or cold, or both.

Getting setup and turning on the lights, I started to play with the extra switches on the wall. I kid you not, one of them heated the towels hanging by the clawfoot, and the other heated the goddamned floor.  This was the shit. I filled the tub, and soaked for a long time finished off my J-bar.  I don't think I've ever been this relaxed in my entire life.  

Shit anyway, I'm getting all caught up in this.  The place and everything about it was just ridiculous and incredible. I got clean, fed, stoned and swooned into that big white bed to sleep like I haven't in years.

I remember dreaming that night.  I dreamed that I was walking towards the A-worx from a couple blocks away and started noticing this big black dark figure in front of it.  Near him I could see that part of the building was colored this rich gold color and as I got closer I could see the arm of the figure moving up and down.  This thing was like nine feet tall and painting the A-worx pure gold, but no matter how much closer I got, I could not make out who or what it was.  It seems to just suck in light and only ever appear to be pitch black.  Then it dipped it's brush again, raised it's arm and started a new section, only this one was crimson.  I stopped dead.  The person or beast or whatever, licked the red brush, dipped it again, and then started covering the crimson color in gold. Then it started to turn towards me slowly.  I could only make out the silhouette but when that slow turning movement was recognized I awoke very suddenly with my heart pounding, covered in sweat.

I grabbed up the covers around me instantly and pressed my back into the headboard, absolutely shocked to find someone in the room with me.

"Don't you say hello?" The look she gave me was almost cold, not a trace of humor in her face, like a challenge.

"Um. Hello."

Then she smiled, a wicked sarcastic grin.  "You kinda look like a conservative suburban housewife all wrapped in your blankets like that.  Ok, shy-boy. why don't you get dressed." She turned and closed the bedroom door behind her.

I jumped up and grabbed my clothes from the floor   quickly got dressed and headed into the main space where I found using her cell-phone on the couch. She put it away and looked back as I came into the room.

"Hmmm... cool gettup." She thought for a minute "Cuter without it though."

I looked down at the dirty, worn denim, spikes and patches that I had been wearing since I was 16, weirdly feeling a bit ashamed.  Maybe it was the contrast with this place, or the way that this girl pulled off goth and class at the same time.  She was skinny with black hair and this little black dress that was just between alternative and cocktail party.  She was probably about 19 or 20 and really fucking cute.

"So. Who are you?" I asked.

"Such a wide and esoteric question!" with lots of snark "I will assume that what you are asking is more like what is my name and why am I here right now.  My name is Ella and I care-take for D.'s apartment while he travels."

"Oh, he mentioned someone watching the place."

"And you must be Jason.  D. told me that you are an actor. What is it that you love about pretending to be someone you're not?"

This lead to hours of really crazy deep conversation.  Ella was insanely intelligent and did not hold back whatsoever.  She was totally bad-ass and impressive.  We ended up rolling another joint, then making drinks and food, and generally relaxed and got to know each other. After dinner she kissed me, and things went on from there.  By 8pm we were sleeping together and frankly life was fucking wonderful.  

Laying in bed with her, listening to my heartbeat start to slow she turned to me.

"You should practice your script." It was a statement rather than a question.

"It can wait." I let out with a sigh. 

She jumped up on top of me. and grabbed my face with her hands.

"Go practice your script, and in an hour we'll be ready to get back in this bed."

Her eyes seemed to gleam with this beautiful amber light, moving and shifting.  She was so beautiful, there was no way I could say no to her.

"Okay.  I'll use the main room and be back."

I was a bit uncomfortable at first performing with her in the house.  It's ridiculous, I know.  I had no trouble with an anonymous crowd, but knowing that my new girl who I just met could hear me performing made me really self-conscious.

I grabbed the script and setup some space in the big open main room, took a second to relax and got started.  At this point I had memorized most of the material so I was able to flow a bit better than before not having to continually read from the script.  Soon I started to feel my anxiety let go, and the more I tried to remember the lines, the more they came to me naturally.  Before I knew it I was cruising through most of the performance almost entirely on autopilot.  I did however try to focus more on feeling and emotion since I seemed to have memorization down.

As I got to about three quarters of the way through, I started hearing this little noise.  At first I thought it may just be random voices from the street outside, every few minutes.  Then it got louder and it sounded more like someone being hurt and letting out gasps.  I tried to ignore it but my mind kept focusing on it as I started to reach the culmination of the performance.  My heart started beating hard. I started feeling overheated while the room felt like it was getting colder by the minute and all the while the noise began increasing now, becoming rhythmic.  I was confused with my attention split between what I was doing and that noise which I now placed in the bedroom.

As the play crescendo-ed it became clear that the noise was Ella reaching orgasm in the next room. She was reaching the point of fury during my final lines and this energy just overtook me.  I began shouting the final part.

"Appear now before me! Appear!" I shouted, heart pumping and sweat dripping from my forehead.  I felt like I was both here and in the bedroom with Ella, fucking her hard at the same time. 

I took hold of myself and ran into the room to see her, legs clenched, eyes rolled back in her head and just racked with pleasure.  I just wanted to be with her so bad and got into bed to hold her and put my hands on her alabaster body.

"Jason, yessss. That was wonderful" she sighed in a long exhale.

 I laid there caressing her, overtaken with this lovely creature.  I ran my fingers through the contours of her body, gripping her neck with my other hand for almost an hour until blackness took over and both of us fell asleep, wrapped in each other's tangle of limbs.

I jolted upright in bed, startled by this incredibly loud noise.  I cannot begin to explain what it sounded like, but it was as if a Lion was in the bedroom with us, right behind the headboard.  The roar was incredibly loud and intense seeming to shake the woodblock pictures on the walls.  For a second I was shocked and confused beyond belief, before laying back down, realizing that I must have had a crazy intense dream.  I had had night terrors as a child, but it had been years since I experienced something quite that intense flowing into waking reality like that.  I began falling back to sleep when I heard Ella whisper in my ear.

"Jason, you've done it, he's come" </TEXT>

Ok, I'm gonna try to get caught up to the current time period so that I can get some advice from you guys.  Big Ups to the people who already responded, I'm starting to think that you guys are right and there might actually be something to this ritual in the play. Anyway I want to thank you all for the response, and I'm hoping I can get some more info on how I should proceed.

So I left off about a week or two in after meeting D. Since then a lot has gone down.  I told you all that we had just really terrible shit go down with my old friend overdosing, fights among everyone at A-worx, etc.  It was a nasty few weeks, but I kept at my practice as much as possible between the back to back shit-storms.

Honestly at that point, closing myself in my room and studying and acting in the play started to become like a refuge from all the other shit going on.  It started to seem like every time I entered my room with the intention to practice, all the crap that was going on in my life would just fall away and I felt great for the next couple hours.  It was strange, just walking through my door started to give me that warm feeling, like popping just one or two Oxy's or something. So I kept at it.

I practiced more and more the next few weeks, and more and more it was the best part of my day.  While that was going on though, the A-worx was changing a lot.  We lost more than half of our regulars who had been crashing there for years and we starting pulling in new people.  Mostly these were squatters for the south and mid-west, coming in on train cars. A lot of them had dogs which was pretty common for this crew, so soon the A-worx had about 13 tenants and 5 German shepherds.  This crew was a bit more fucked up than our standard mix though, most were long term heroin users (we always had a few nodders but the balance increased) and a lot of them were older than our normal crowd.

Anyway, I'm just saying that the vibe really started to change.  We went from a bunch of energetic, younger anarchist kids to this crew of 30 and even 40-something addict drifters.  It started to affect everything.  Some of the guys were dealing from the space attracting a lot of gang members from the city, and the police starting showing up asking about robberies near our block.  Mostly the cops were cool and didn't mess with us about the space or how we were living (no rules and regs shit) but I was always the one to speak to them and they were getting more and more pushy about the newer people staying there.

And of course it came to a head about a week later (about three weeks from the date scheduled for the play.)  I was in my room practicing, just at the end of the ritual and culmination of the play, demanding over and over that Byleth appear before me and do my "bidding" or whatever.  And right at that moment with me feeling really strong and good about the role, putting all this emotional energy into, a fucking gunshot rings out.

I dropped the persona and ran outside to see Red running to some of the back rooms, covering his stomach with his hand and pouring blood on the floor.  Two more shots ring out and I see the shooter, some 20-something gang-banger with sweat pants on trying to take him out as he ran.  I took cover   dropped until the dude stooped down, grabbed a bag and took off down the hall to the exit.

"Motherfucker!" a few of the others started yelling.  

One of them headed down the hall after the shooter (fucking idiot) while me and the others started headed towards Red.  We followed his trail of blood in, out and around the sectioned out spaces at the west end of our space.  I hadn't been back in those small spaces for a while, since the new squatter crew had settled in that end of the space and mostly tried to keep to themselves.  When I got there I instantly regretted that, being a long term member I should have been better about checking up.

So we find Red sprawled out at the back of the western-most space, surrounding by broken glass and there's smoke pouring into the air around him.  I knew what was up immediately cuz a friend of mine who I won't name used to have a lab in his apartment.  These guys must have been cooking meth out of this room for a while.  The realization came about as fast as the flames starting rising from the growing pools of mixed liquids on the floor.  

I gotta tell you, you always hear people talking about flames "licking you".  I get it now.  The fire started on the floor a few feet away from me, and within a couple seconds they leapt and "licked" the side of my face.  I was out fast.  Red must have been dead already and even if not he was most certainly fucked. There were a few minutes as I headed to the slop sink where I thought we'd be able to put out the fire. Two minutes later the place was a tinder box and all of us ran to escape the building.  But I grabbed one single thing first, the script.  It was the only irreplaceable thing I owned and was foremost on my mind.

That was the end of the A-worx.  Everyone staying there scattered into the city to avoid questioning, including myself. 

It was a weird feeling. I was pretty fucked up honestly.  There I was just walking block after block in a straight line from what had been my home for years, holding this script and almost nothing else.  I had nowhere to go, no idea what to do about the fire, being that I was on the lease.  I had nothing and nowhere to crash.  I had spent a summer like this years back, sleeping at the train station or trying to catch shut-eye in the city parks when the weather was good, but that shit gets old fast.  I was not ready to go back to that, but had no options.  I started thinking about who I might be able to couch surf with, or trying to ask around about local squats.

What I really wanted though was to get a bit lit to calm me down.  I had no weed, pills or anything else on me, they were all in my backpack which definitely did not exist any more. I started looking for working payphones which were pretty rare at this point when I passed Dirty Fred's bar.  This was one of my favorite hangouts and I quickly decided that the $40 i had on me was best spent there. Yeah, I'm smart.

I walk in amidst the awesome typical blast of music (The Germs, I love this bar) and smoke and noise and I stop in my tracks dumbfounded.  Sitting in the booth closest to the entrance is Fucking D!  He was just sitting there alone with both hands wrapped around his glass of Scotch like he was waiting for me.

"Jason" he looked up and invited me to the seat next to him. He turned his head and said in a low voice that I could barely hear "One more for my friend."

I have no idea how the bartender could hear him over the din in that place but I was seated and drinking scotch with D. in like two seconds.  I couldn't even form a sentence, and had no compunction for small talk.

"How are things?" he savored a sip in his mouth and waited patiently.

"The piece is going well, I'm really feeling it. I think you'll like my work" I struggled to give him an update "What are you doing here?"

 "I'm just having a drink before I leave for Boston. I trust that the play is going well. I trust you.  I was asking how you were, personally."

"Well, not too good.  The A-worx is on fire. Like right now as we speak." I blurted.

"That is unfortunate." calm and understated.  He stopped for a moment and seemed to be thinking. "I suppose that you might need a place to stay, and an advance on your payment."

"My payment?" I was astounded.

"Yes, True art is valuable.  You are performing true art. Let's see." He again paused, tapping his glass slowly.  "I do have someone who has agreed to check in on my Baltimore apartment while I am gone, but I suppose under the circumstances..."

D. reached into his suit jacket and took out a checkbook and started writing. Then he did the same with a small pad, and pushed a check, a note and a key to me over the table.

"Here is the address, and a $500 advance for food and clothing. You are welcome to stay there as long as you wish. I don't expect to be back until our little performance and even then I'll be staying with friends in the Historical House."

"Shit, I can't..." I started.

"Shit you can, and will.  You must understand that I mean to make a fair deal of impact and money from this performance, and it's subsequent showings.  You will be further compensated after the play and I think that you will be very happy with what I have in mind, now that I know your situation."

"What  do you mean?" I was both excited, and honestly feeling a bit greedy.  I hadn't expected any payment but D. made it seem like I'd really get something out of this.

"I was going to wait to tell you this, but I suppose under the circumstances it is only fair." He looked me in the eyes, holding a stare. "I am in town because I just finished acquiring another building in the city.  My hope was to develop this into an community building dedicated to performance art.  If things go well, I will grant you a ten year lease for one floor of the building at no cost, and you may if you wish, re-assemble your little community."

"I don't know what to say." I really didn't. This was crazy and I was both confused and excited that within minutes of losing something I had worked on for years, it was destroyed and being given back to me.  I'd be able to do so much without having to pay rent.  The new A-worx could use the money it raises for outreach, an improved free book program for local prisons, funding for "Food not Bombs", all kinds of shit.

"Then say nothing.  Finish your drink, maybe get another, and get some sleep. But I must go. I have a flight to catch." He rose quickly.

"Wait" I tried to stop him. "The play. The ritual in the play, what is it?  Where did you get it?"

He stopped only for a moment. "Jason.  You should know better.  Pure art is mystery.  Live in the mystery and I will answer all of your questions once the performance is over.  Until the Sixth, my friend." He left quickly.

I did have another drink. And then I had another two.  

I kept looking out the window, fearing that the police or firemen would find me any moment and start to question me, but they never came.  I just sat and stewed for hours thinking.  My life really had gone to shit since I accepted this part, there was no denying that.  I started thinking about all the implications, thinking about doing this ritual in the play over and over and everything falling apart around me.  This is the point where I really started to mentally connect everything, but what could I do?

I had nothing left, except for what D. gave me. And I had to put on the performance to get back what I had.  I was worried, but I was on a path.  There was only one good outcome in sight at this point.  Buckle down, do the play whatever it took and then I could put my life back together, brand new with better opportunities.

I think that's all I can share tonight. I didn't even manage to get to tell you about the apartment, Dervish, or about my friend's girl Camilla yet but I've gotta pack it in for the night, I'm exhausted and I have to get one more practice in before I crash out.

Promise to write more soon and get you up to date before the performance.  Cheers everyone and thanks for the feedback.  I know you guys are right, but man.... I don't think I have any option here.

<TEXT> Hey Everyone.

I was gonna post this to /r/occult but it seemed like the crew in the sub-reddit has been really helpful with other people dealing with really strange stuff. So I'm posting this here instead to ask for advice.  I hope you'll forgive my shitty writing.  Sometimes it seems like people who post here are crazy detailed and just really professional or something.  I ain't that guy, at all, but I really need help and I hope you can give me some advice about what's been going on.

I guess I'll just jump in and start telling you where this all started.  I guess that's where D showed up at our place.  So it's like a Tuesday night around midnight or so and we're hanging out bullshitting politics and getting fucked up like usual.  There were about eight to ten of us living there at this point.  It's not really like a squat or anything because the building it legit (but I don't think it's actually zoned residential). 

Anyway, in walks this guy. Wearing a fucking suit.  A really crazy nice suit, all straight lines like it was made for him.  Now, I don't really care what people look like but most of us at the A-Worx (it's our name for the anarchist collective) are pretty grungy.  You know. we're all spikes and denim and stuff with a mix of leather lovers, goth chicks and thrift store junkies.  So it was weird to have this dude all clean cut looking like money walk in in the middle of the night.

He doesn't even say anything but everybody there eventually sees him   stops talking. We all start looking at each-other like "what the fuck" and then Bean-boy jumps up, pulling on his shirt and yelling. 

"D! motherfucking D! yeah! hell yeah!" waving his arms around.

"Bean, you know this guy?" I asked.  

I felt like a bit of a dick but I had been around the A-worx for the longest out of everyone there. So I felt like I needed to know who was around and keep things on the level.

"Yeah man! Fucking D!" pointing at him with his good hand. "This is the dude I was telling you about. The fucking mad writer!"

Now I remembered.  Me and Bean-Boy were hanging out after this anti-capitalist puppet show a couple weeks back. It was sweet, there was this awesome chick who opened for it playing Misfits songs on a Ukulele. Fucking epic.  Anyway he was telling me that he met this guy in NYC that put together this naked fire dance in the middle of the city with about 50 performers.  Turns out that he's a playwright too and he told Bean-boy that he'd be down this way soon and look us up.

At this point Freddie, Dervish, Faks and the rest of them started talking and lighting up again,  a bit less interested now that they knew the guy was cool.  I, on the other hand was really interested and introduced myself to D.

"You must be Jason." Dude stared deep at me.

"Yeah I'm Jason. Bean tell you about me or something?"

"Yes. We talked about you quite a bit.  I understand that you are the actor of the group." It wasn't really a question but the silence was weird.

"Well, I am really into performance art.  I've done a few things that A-worx put together and did one formal play a few years back.  It was received pretty well."

"You do have something. I can see that. Let me tell you about the project I want to put on." He started to walk into the space.

I was getting excited. Acting and performance art has always been my thing and this guy seemed like the real deal.  It wasn't about money or fame or any of that bullshit for me.  It's the whole idea of putting on masks and changing how people think about the world.  

So then frigging Faks gets up, slaps D on the shoulder and starts to hand him a bong.  I try to stop him, mostly cuz I know that it's like half weed and half dust, Faks loooves dust. I was pretty surprised  when D put up his palm to me and torched a huge hit.  I was even more surprised that D started moaning "Ahhh... PCP" when he exhaled.  This guy might look all fancy but he's pretty bad-ass.

Anyway we started talking.  He had written this script that he was really into.  The thing only had one single performer for the whole play. I was fucking psyched, this was a huge opportunity, especially since this guy was known.  So not only that, but it was about a guy who's trying to raise a Demon, and that's cool enough but there's more.  D insisted that this had to be performed Guerrilla style at this old-ass cemetery at midnight and we'd have to climb the walls and break in.

 D said he could get a cadre of about 200 people to break in to see the performance live and that it would be professionally filmed and then shown to small exclusive groups. I was so excited about the whole thing, I immediately started hounding him about reading for it and asking for a script.

"Jason. Do you want this?  Do you agree to put on this performance under my guidance?" He was looking me dead in the eyes.

"Yes, I do. I'll do whatever I need to to make this great." Feeling a bit weird about being like a beggar, but this seemed like an incredible opportunity.

He shook my hand and told me the part was mine.  He said I had something.  He didn't even care about me reading for it or trying out or anything.  D decided right there it was me.

Then he explained that there was one single copy of the script.  He told me that I could never show it to anyone and said that even though he was not that kind of guy, he would sue the ruin out of me if I copied it or showed it to anyone.  He made me sign some papers and handed me the script.

The first thing I noticed was that every page of the script had a seal stamped into the paper I guess to mark the original copy.

The title of the piece was "Byleth".

"Jason. Take this script. Find some quiet private space."he looked around the A-worx like he was trying to make sure there was private space here, since it was mostly open industrial. "You have sixty days. In sixty days, on May the 6th I will be here in the afternoon to meet you and escort you to the performance area."

"Wait, you're leaving.  You're not going to check up on what I'm doing or give me notes or whatever?" I was shocked and getting a bit nervous about my skills.

"This script is all you need.  Study it inside and out.  Make it yours. Read it, act it out and feel it.  It's that simple." he put his hand on my should and said "May sixth, be ready."  he turned and walked out the door.

Fucked up right?  That's a lot to put on somebody and expect that they're going to do a decent job of something so important.  I'm a fucking cowboy though and I can pony up for shit like this.  I was determined to do this right and got right to it.  I took a quick puff and headed off to my room to start reading and studying the script.

The script was fucking sick.  It was just like he described it, a solo piece about a kid who turns to the occult to gain power and does this big elaborate ritual to bring this Demon to help him. The ending was not really anything climactic, just the end of the ritual but overall the play was amazing.  I started work on memorization and performance the next day after I read through it a few times that night.

Over the course of the next week shit starting happening that was really messing with my concentration.  My buddy Fleek who lived with us at the A-worx overdosed and died.  I found our cat, Chaiman Meow, fucking gutted and nailed to the wall. This caused a huge rift among everyone in the space and it ended with fist fights, a broken nose and three of our regulars moving out. And there were just like a hundred other little things that just kept coming up, really fucking with the A-worx, our friends and my concentration.  

But I sucked it up and did my best.  I practiced and memorized lines 6 hours a day, every single day. I tried on different voices and personas. I did it sober and and I did it high. On blow and on weed, drunk, whatever.  I really experimented with it trying to find the right way to play this.

Ah shit.  I've gotta run right now.  Faks is freaking out about his girl Camilla, she's been missing for a few days.  Anyway I promise I'll write more soon, I need some help   gotta get through this.

For now, has anyone heard of D?  He was a big writer and performance artist in NYC.  Anyone ever see or hear about a play like this? Or know anything about this shit?  Please let me know if you do.  I've got to tell you the rest of what's happened so far but anything you know about what I wrote so far might help with what I'm dealing with right now.

Write more soon.

[[Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4wtqtk/information_you_must_consider_part_three/)]

At this point I had no idea what to accept. I thought about trying to somehow trace her phone position by calling our mobile provider, but decided against this and instead sped home. I know my wife very well, and planned to question her and examine the situation at home in order to discern the truth of the text.

My head was, as you would imagine, alive with theories and possibilities. But I will not list all everything that I considered while driving. My purpose is to share this information in an effort of preservation, not to aggrandize myself for my impotent analytical ability.

I was there in no time avoiding the previous traffic fluidly, and flew into the front den, my son perched on my hip. I stopped dead in my tracks to find that my wife was sitting on the couch between two men in suits, who were then flanked by two security guards.

She called my name in a sympathetic tone but did not seem frightened as she quickly rose to take S. from my arms. She turned to look inquiringly at the men behind her who were now standing up from the sofa.

"What did you tell them?" I pulled at my wife's arm sleeve.

"Everything" not even turning back to face me.

"I trust that you can arrange care for your child quickly." The man in the suit to the left of my wife inquired.

I thought for a moment.

"Yes, let me call our neighbor and tell her it's an emergency."

"It is." He confirmed peering into my eyes, clearly making a statement, and clearly angered that I had not come into the lab sooner.

I made a phone call and arranged for child care for the day, or even the night if necessary and within 30 minutes our son was being watched at our home and my wife and I both were escorted into a black SUV in front of our building.

'Are you Ok? What happened?" I asked, examining her face.

"They arrived thirty minutes ago and said that there had been an incident at your lab. They said people were possibly spreading something, like a disease and that I needed to tell them everything that happened since yesterday." She looked concerned but relatively stable.

"Did you leave the house today?" This may have been my only chance to ask.

"No they arrived right after I texted you, when I woke up. Why? Do you think I have something and would spread it? Oh god, our son." this is where the tears began.

"I don't think we're sick. It's Ok. Let's just see what they know." I put my arm around her in the back of the truck as we drove to the lab.

I inquired about what was happening with the two security guards in the back with us, as the driver had the privacy window up and were inaccessible. As I had expected they were of no assistance or information other than sharing their orders, which were to deliver us to the lab.

When we reached CERN it was almost as if my second home had been completely transformed. The grounds were now surrounded by four levels of barbed wire chain-link fence and there were concrete barriers littered in front of and in between sections every few feet. There was a new makeshift security entrance that had a staff of ten or so armed guards. It took fifteen minutes of conversation and phone calls even to allow their own SUV onto the grounds where we found an entire secondary protocol at the front door. There we were thoroughly searched, scanned and questioned, and my credentials were retrieved before we were allowed access.

Once inside, there were further similar but smaller hurdles as we were escorted downstairs.

"Dr., please" the bald man in the suit gestured to one of the many doors to small offices in the hallway. My wife and I proceeded to enter the room, but he quickly but gently took hold of her elbow.

"We need to ask you questions. Separately." It was clear that there was no way to prevent this.

"Misses, please" gesturing to the room right next to mine.

I caught my wife's eye, and clearly both our eyes contained some worry.

"It's ok." I reassured her "I'll be right next door."

I was sat at a small metal desk, upon a metal chair. The room was entirely devoid of furniture or decoration.In only a moment after sitting I received my expected guest, and was a bit surprised to not recognize the man whatsoever. This was a large enterprise and there were many people involved, but after working here for over eight years most people were familiar to me, if not known well.

This man was unfamiliar and also a bit unsettling. He was of average age and height with short black hair. He was fit but seemed to draw his body into the room as if he was both completely relaxed, and expertly tensed at the same time.  From the moment the door opened his eyes were peering into mine intently.

"Doctor, as you know we've had a breach, the results of which are specific temporal anomalies.  I understand that you have experienced the Phenomena." he held his hands behind his back, ever so slightly leaning forward over me.  His statement seemed so matter-of-fact that it took me an extra moment to respond.

"Yes." I said quietly.

"Yes? You must tell me about what you have experienced." his lips pursed coldly.

"What is happening?  What was that experiment, and exactly what is it causing?  I need to know if this will affect my family."

"For your family then." raising his eyebrows slightly "The experiment was the successful confirmation of a new theory regarding the method by which matter could be made to exceed light speed.  Accomplishing this has caused an ongoing shift in space-time culminating in temporary distortions of reality. We are trying to determine how this is, and what can be done to reverse it." He spoke very quickly, as if scripted."Now what have you experienced?"

I was not entirely satisfied with the answer I was given, though it seemed to be both clear and true.  It was lacking detail and seemed like an attempt to discard the question by satisfying it minimally.  I felt that in order to get more information I may need to give, so I began to recount my experience while I was in the Lab, describing the first door. I decided to stop here, and ask a question.

"The other employees are they still here? Have they had the same experiences?" 

"We are questioning the employees, collecting information and then sending them on their way. Some are here, other's have answered our questions and have gone home. Most have had this same experience regarding new Doors in their homes or other locations. Now, when you arrived home?" He inquired.

I continued my story explaining that my wife had traveled through a door and exited from a distant building. I recounted everything that had occurred with one large exception.  I did not inform the man about spotting my wife in the city, entering the apartment or seeing that someone had a dragged a body through one of these doors.

"And that is everything?" He looked deeply into my eyes, examining them.

"Yes, why?"

"Others, who had friends or loved ones travel had some further experiences." 

"Such as?" trying to prompt him for detail.

He studied me and seemed to make a mental decision "Various things.  No matter. If that is your complete experience then we are finished.  I've been told there is one other person to see you in a friendly capacity. I'll send him in."

The man turned quickly to leave. As he did so I noticed what looked like an almost unnoticeable tattoo on the back of his neck.  It was a series of dots in a formation that resembled a Cyrillic letter.  The dots were scattered but seemed to be some sort of geometric formation, similar to a QR code. I wondered if this was a requirement for this man's position in the organization, or a bio-metric security system.  It did strike me as I'd never seen before on anyone in the building including security staff.

In a matter of seconds, Leonard entered the room. I was a bit surprised to see him as he had been absent from the office lately. Leonard and I had worked together closely for two years about five years ago.  He was a reliable person and a good friend though we had not seen each-other quite so often after he was reassigned.

Leonard smiled at me meekly.

"Leonard, how are you. What do you know about what is going on?"

"I'm doing well, considering the circumstances.  Frankly I do not know much about the incident, but I did hear some stories from others."

"I've seen the doors, what else have you heard about?" I asked.

"Well" he said slowly and quietly "I heard that some people saw others going into and out of doors. Have you seen anything like that?"

I held my ground with my original story, feeling that it was important not to tell anyone about the scene I had seen at the apartment. I decided instead to inquire further.

"They saw people coming in and out? What were they doing? What did they say?"

Leonard looked displeased for a split second before recovering himself and asking "Only the people who experienced it could tell you. I'd love to learn more before they let me go home, did you see anything like that?"

I sat silently trying to navigate my answer when we were both startled by a loud knock at the door. I was jolted and Leonard turned to answer the call.  

That's when I saw it. My "old friend" who I had known for years, who was so traditional and routine that he categorized his socks by week-day had a tattoo similar to, but slightly different from the man who questioned me.  It all fell into place. I was not speaking to Leonard, I was speaking to his double.  I was questioned by a double, and now my old friend was being emulated in front of me. My wife had one out there in the world and she had committed a violent crime for some unknown reason and dragged the body through that door to god-knows where.

Whatever had happened, the outcome was that these doors were some sort of cosmic photocopier for our species.  Duplicates of human men and women were being made when one stepped through, and they were acting in our world with their own unknown agenda. The revelation was fast, and though I was awestruck I also steeled myself for action.

"Leonard, wait. I did see something." I blurted out quickly.

He turned back to me with one hand on the door, waiting for my response.

"I don't trust those guards, can you buy me a minute? I want to talk to you about this, not them." I said trying to curry favor and get rid of the other intruder.

Leonard cracked the door, had a word with the man who had knocked and came back to me.

"It's my wife," I said in a low voice "You know that she stepped through.  Well I saw something else. But..." I paused "I haven't gotten a chance to speak to her about it, and I want her here to get the full picture.  Can we bring her in?"

Leonard looked unconvinced.

"Lenny...." I said pleadingly "You know us! We do everything together, and I just couldn't tell anyone, and I haven't told anyone, unless I share it with her too. You know how we are."

"Alright, I'll fetch her and then you can both tell me?"

"Yes" I confirmed. "Thanks."

He left the room swiftly and as the door swung shut I shot up and headed for the corner of the room near the door.  I knew that this was my only possible chance, and even if we got out of the room together, our chances of escaping the building were very unlikely.  However, after the shock of realization about what was happening had finally hit me, it was easy to let go of probabilities, fear and doubt.  There was only one chance, one option pitted against us never leaving this building alive.

My wife walked in first and seeing the empty chair turned her head to see me crammed into the corner.  I put my finger over my mouth and gestured that she should keep moving forward toward the empty chair.  She caught on quickly and she managed to block the view of that empty seat from what looked like Leonard.

Once they were both inside the room and the door was swinging shut, I leapt. My years of  Krav Maga classes paid off in this moment for the first time.  I had taken them before I had started working in New York City in the late 90's in order to protect myself. In retrospect I never would have thought that I would be in more danger in Switzerland of all places.

Within a split second I had my left hand covering Leonard's mouth while my right arm was wrapped around his neck strangulating him.  After a short struggle at acceptable noise levels Leonard was unconscious on the floor.  My wife was looking shocked and scared but was clearly understanding that the situation was dire.

"Everyone here, they are not what they seem.  They will never let us leave this building alive. We must find a way out." I whispered frantically to her.

She nodded her head slowly "How? There's an armed guard right outside the room!"

 This room was absolutely bare with no other possible exit. I pointed at the ceiling. 

"We might be able to find a vent."

I got up on the table as quietly as possible and started handing ceiling tiles down to her.  After a few it became obvious that this was not going to get us out of the room.  There was only solid concrete one foot above the drop ceiling which small holes for the pipes and wiring.

"Shit." not used to swearing often "Ok. We're going to have to take that guard out and get his gun."

Clearly this was not a popular option with my wife, as she looked absolutely horrified by the idea. She started shaking her head no, and dropped her face into her hands sobbing slightly.  I reached out to her to hold her and reassure her that there was a chance.  This could work if I could get his weapon.  I continued, explaining that I knew the building well, that we could get to the warehouse and force the loading doors, that we could in fact get out of here if we played our cards right.  At that moment there were several loud knocks at the door again and I lifted her head by the chin.

She looked up at me with tears streaming down her face clearly scared but accepting the reality of the situation.  Then her eyes widened.  She was no longer looking me in the eyes, but looking behind me.

Expecting to see the guard entering, I turned.  But there was no guard and the door was still closed.  However, about one foot to the right of it, stood another.

With one meaningful glance between us, we were gone. The implications of using one of those doors was not considered for a moment.  At that time it's appearance was a miracle.  Only later did I smirk about that horror being our only salvation.

This is where we come to the end of what I have experienced.

We safely exited a door in an office building only two miles from our home.  Our fortune was incredible.  Within minutes we had convinced an employee to bring us to our house where we picked up our son and began our journey.  It was not simple and we were forced to be very cautious and even break a few laws to exit the country.  It did not stop there.  It took us three months of rides from strangers, borrowed money from friends via western union, several illegal border crossings and lots of camping outdoors before we reached Morocco via a ferry from Southern Spain.

Here we felt safe enough, at least far inland where we situated.  We were able to get a  friend to access our accounts and send it to us via mailed packages addressed to some locals we had befriended and paid well.  We were able to rent an apartment in a small remote town under false names and over time we trusted that we had managed to leave as little of a trail as possible and that we were safe.

Even knowing this we agreed to never allow ourselves to spend more than six to nine months in any one locality, at least for the foreseeable future.  We've managed to live ordinary lives in the years past the incident, always with some worry, but comfortable considering what we have seen.  

That is my story, and I give it to you in hopes of only one thing.

If you see a door that should not be there, do not use it.

If you know someone who has gone through that door, be wary of them always. They may not be themselves.

If you see someone with a strange dotted geometric tattoo on the back of their neck, get away from them at all costs.

Our world has been invaded.  The uninvited are here, among us, with an agenda. They must be stopped if our race is to remain in control of it's own destiny.  Spread the word, spread the knowledge and Godspeed in our defense. </TEXT>

I had barely slept.  Analysis, speculation and nightmare scenarios left me turning over in bed for several hours when I realized that I needed to get my son, S. to school.  Though the recent events were astounding and all encompassing, I did not want to sacrifice my family's stability by changing his schedule abruptly.  Frankly I think that my desire to retain a sense of normalcy was my main motivation.

My wife seemed deeply asleep and I chose to let her take refuge in that for a time while I cared for the business of the morning convincing myself that I would be returning in thirty minutes time.

I was frustrated to see the traffic become almost impassable as I neared the school and tried to calm myself by realizing that it would only add perhaps ten minutes to my trip.  I chatted with S. as our car inched closer and closer to the building.

That was when I saw them.  Outside the school building were three black SUV's and alongside them were six men in suits.  One of the men I clearly recognized from the institute, his oddly shaped bald head standing out very clearly.  I could see them peering down the street towards us, speaking into their microphones and pressing wired receivers into their ears.

Without even realizing what I was doing, I pulled hard to the right down the nearest side street which was relatively clear and escaped the scene.  The staff was obviously there waiting for me because I did not arrive at CERN last night.  In no way would I allow myself to be escorted to the office and separated from my child under any circumstances, and this would certainly be the outcome if I was seen.

I weaved through the town toward the highway that would lead home, explaining to my son that it looked like school was closed today.  He giggled and asked me if it was Christmas, to which I replied that today might be a special secret holiday.  We talked about what kind of holiday today could be distractedly, as once again I found my car in standstill traffic.

"Is that why Mommy's here?" S. inquired excitedly.

"Mommy?"

"Right. there." he pointed out the open window to a small cafe on the left side of the street.  

After a moment of casual scanning I saw her.  K. was seated at an outdoor table at the cafe sipping coffee and laughing across from a local resident.  I had no doubt whatsoever that it was her.  Everything from her clothes (the ones she was wearing yesterday) to her mannerisms convinced me immediately of another fact I could not possibly reconcile.  I had left her sleeping, drove here at a relatively fast pace, and yet here she was in the middle of breakfast with a stranger.

I sat dumbfounded watching the man pick up the check, taking her hand and the two of them leaving the cafe.  They were walking down the street laughing and looking like they had some private joke between them before turning the corner.

I quickly maneuvered the car to follow them and watch them ascending the stairs of a complex on Chemin Du Renard, and then disappear into an apartment.  My mind buzzed, split between reality and madness. I went from thinking that she was cheating on me, to thinking that she must have passed through another door at home and exited here.  What I could not do was to allow this to unfold without knowing what was happening.

I pulled the car over into a small space much too near the intersection, but safe enough to park for a short time.  I put on my blinkers and calmly explained to S. that I was going to lock the doors, and he should stay in his car seat.  He did not complain, acting as if this were a game we were participating in.  I kissed him on the head and told him I would be right back.

I ascended the stairs, becoming overly excited and even enraged.  I knocked on the door, waited, then knocked again.  There was no sound from inside, and no response to my inquiry for several minutes.  I then began to pound heavily on the door, shouting my wife's name.  Nothing.  I twisted the handle, and impotently shoved my shoulder against the door.  There was nothing for it.

I quickly had an idea and executed it.  I ran downstairs to the main entrance of the building and located the office.  I burst in and frantically explained that my wife had locked our son in the car, had the keys, and could not hear me from the apartment that she was in.  I think that my excitement and agitation had great effect, as the manager immediately got the super and we headed up to the apartment in question.  

"Mr. L's apartment?" The manager looked at me inquisitively.

"Yes, that's her friend. Please, I must get those car keys, he's just sitting there screaming." I pointed to the car on the corner.

The manager and the super shared a concerned look, but after knocking and getting no response they unlocked the door and the three of us entered the foyer.  

"K.," I shouted, barging into through the foyer quickly.  

When I reached the bedroom I saw it, and was able to act quickly.  There was one door in the bedroom, leading I suppose into the master bath.  On the floor to the left of that door was a thick trail of blood, as if something large and bleeding had been dragged.  The blood trail ended abruptly at the wall, one foot away from the bathroom door.  

I turned quickly, blocking the view of the super and the manager and ushered them back to the front door.  

"She's not here, but I found the keys in my jacket," I uttered as we left.

I rushed back to the car in a panic and drove away before I could even hear or acknowledge their response. As I pulled away they were still standing on the landing watching me drive.  I have no idea whether or not they re-entered the apartment, and I cannot imagine what they would think if they had.

I saw the screen of my phone light up in the cup-holder of the car and raised it.  It was a text from my wife,  It said "You bringing S, to school?  Could you pick up some aspirin on the way back?".

I did not have even a moment to consider the implications of this phenomenon taking place in my home, miles from CERN.  I was immediately shocked into action as my phone began to ring and I swiftly made my way to our kitchen to answer, so as not to wake my wife or son.  

"Yes" I spun around looking behind me toward the bedroom, feeling very paranoid.

"Dr N. Listen to me carefully." The voice was metered and fast "There has been a security breach at CERN,  We are this time requesting all personnel to immediately make their way to the institute.  There is nothing to be concerned about but your presence is integral at this time. Please confirm your arrival."

"I what has happened" I stammered.

"Mr. N.  I can only share that your presence is required immediately.  Please leave your home, we are expecting to see you in thirty five minutes." at which point I heard the click of disconnection.

I looked behind me toward the bedroom, and then down at the phone as I slowly placed it in it's cradle.  

In all of my time at the institute nothing like this had ever occurred.  I could only assume that the phenomena I was experiencing had been noticed and was being acted upon.  I wondered for several minutes what the organization or the security staff would possibly do with the information regarding what I had witnessed.  I wondered if they knew that it was continuing to have effects off-premises, and that being the case what action they could take.

My fear overcame me quickly.  I knelt down holding my chest as I allowed the surge of blood in my ears and the pounding of my heart consume my thinking.  I gasped after realizing that I had stopped breathing and began to focus on calming myself.  I understood how to mitigate the effects of this panic attack, having had them for years in college.

After centering myself, I decided that there was no other option than to comply with the security personnel.  I turned back to the bedroom to dress and wake my wife informing her of where I was going.  

"No," I stated matter-of-factly when I saw the bed empty, the bathroom door open, no sign of my wife, and only our usual single bedroom door.  "No, no, no." I repeatedly like a mantra as I tore around the room and then the remainder of the house.  My son was asleep in his bed, undisturbed but there was no sign whatsoever of my wife, K.

She went through, I thought.  She must have been woken by the call and came to check on me. She probably didn't even notice that there were two doors in her sleepy confusion. My eyes went wide, the pounding of my heart began again, my head was swimming with thought, and I must have lost consciousness.

I awoke again to the phone ringing. There was a very sharp pain at my right temple and upon later inspection I realized that I had hit my head on our dresser.  I groggily made my way to the kitchen again, not having any idea about how much time had passed.  I assumed that this would be a follow up call from the new security contingent at CERN, but I was wrong.

"Hon, it's me." I was entirely startled by the soft tired voice of my wife.

"Oh God. You're ok," I exhaled fully "Where are you?"

"I I am in Annemasse," she said questioningly.  "I am at the MJC Youth Center."

I looked at my watch and saw that I had only been unconscious for minutes.  Annemasse was almost an hour from our house.  My eyes widened in wonder.

"I don't know what's happening to me," she whimpered "The last thing I remember is getting up to come see who you were talking to.  And then," the rest was indistinguishable through her now full out crying. 

"Listen," I said "You are ok.  There's nothing wrong with you. Do you hear me K?"

"But," I did not let her continue.

"There is nothing wrong with you. This is something else. Please, tell me what happened after you got up to some see me."  I wanted to know just what she had experienced.

"I got up, opened the door, walked through it and then I was in another room instead of our hallway. That's what it seems like, but I must be going crazy.  I keep thinking it's a tumor, or an aneurysm, I'm so scared." 

"It's not. You are fine.  I can explain everything, but just know that you are well. I will come get you.  I'm leaving now and will get the neighbors to come and sit for S. He is still asleep."

"Alright.  I'm ok.  I am in a dormitory room with two students.  They are very kind and gave me some clothes to wear.  I will say goodbye and meet you near the front office."

"I will be there soon.  Stay calm, I'll explain shortly." 

I hung up the phone, arranged a sitter and left the house posthaste.  I was relieved and incredibly worried at the same time.  She sounded safe however there was no way to quantify what this experience may have had on her, mentally or physically.  Thoughts of the darkest kind ran through my mind as I sped to her location.

When I arrived I calmed her, explained everything I had experienced and decided to take her to the hospital and tell the doctors that she had lost consciousness, demanding a full scan and workup. We sat waiting for hours until finally she was given a clean bill of health, confirming that all her scans and physical responses were normal. We both decided not to talk too much about the events that were unfolding.  We were tired and concerned enough without intentionally aggravating both of our imaginations. We focused on confirming that K. was well and deciding to spend tomorrow examining the situation over breakfast.

It was near to sunrise when we returned home, relieved the sitter and took a very short and fitful nap.  We were feeling somewhat relieved but pensive regarding the intense unknowns of this situation.  

Lucky for us we had no idea where this would lead, until the next day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My name is Dr. N.  I choose not to reveal my identity for the sake of my family, and will provide no details that may put my anonymity at risk. I will be able to provide no evidence,no background or laurels for myself or my colleagues.  I share only the record of what I have experienced, posted anonymously. I do understand that the incredible nature of what I am choosing to share publically will likely result in my findings being immediately discredited by anyone who comes across them.  There is nothing that I can do to ensure that this message is heard by the general public without putting my family, my life and my career in immediate danger.

I am resigned however, to try, for the chance that the information may become historically important at some future date.

I am a research assistant at CERN working with data gathered from the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) experiments in Geneva.  Three months ago the CERN institute underwent some large scale development, and security policy enhancements.  It soon became clear to me that there was a new project preparing to be implemented and it was being strictly monitored to prevent communication regarding the nature or scope of the work to be undertaken.

An unknown military contractor was hired and within days our labs, data centers, and the entire premises was overtaken by this new personal.  I am not comfortable with weaponry of any sort and I must share that the sheer number of armed personnel made me uncomfortable for the duration of their stay.  This became a very tense time and I was often unable to focus due to the stress.

I will do my best to keep this as non technical as possible, as the information that is most important to share is actually of a very non technical nature.  I began receiving large sets of data to analyse. It was clear that the new experiments were now operational and the collider was running at full operational capacity.  

Based on the data, I can say that the LHC was now actually operating well beyond operational capacity, as far as it had been originally conceived.  It took me nearly a week, but after processing and analyzing the data sets I was given it became clear that somehow the LHC had managed to accelerate beyond the speed of light.  I questioned the data, checked and triple checked and I became convinced that this was the case.  Furthermore it seems quite clear based on my calculations that the accelerated material in question was not a subatomic particle at all, but a full and complete AU (gold) atom. This made the issue of acceleration even more astounding and groundbreaking.  I only had various small pieces of data however the story they told when assembled and analyzed was quite clear.

At this point my curiosity got the better of me and I began to inquire frequently and widely regarding the current experimentation.  Over the following days it became immediately apparent that I knew a great deal more than anyone who was not central to the operation. The security protocols were very stringent and entirely successful, as no one outside the inner circle (of which I do not know the members) knew anything of substance.

This is the point at which you will likely discard what I am about to share with you as a hoax, the imagination of an insane man, or any number of explanations more scientifically reasonable than what I am presenting.

It was 7:30pm on Wednesday July 27th, 2016 and I was ensuring that my analysis processes were running properly before leaving for the evening.  Everything looked to be in proper order and I turned to exit my office.  It struck me as I took hold of the door knob.  There, approximately one foot to the left of my single office door was an exact duplicate,  There was at that time a second door, exactly like my only office door in every detail offset by approximately twelve inches on the same wall.

My first reaction was absolute paralysis.  I stood staring and not taking my hand off of the pre-existing door handle for some time and I experienced a deep intense sense of dread.

It was at this point that I quickly concluded that I was being made the focal point of a somewhat strange but almost typical prank by my co-workers.   The scientists who made up the staff at CERN were varied, most being very intense and serious people.  However there was a contingent which was heavily into what is called "Geek Culture" and who tend to very much enjoy mixing their fascinations with pop culture with their work.  Dr F. from Switzerland for example kept a poster in his office with a Kitten hanging from the entrails of a Zombie character stuck in a tree which held the caption "Hang in there Baby".  Dr. F. and his similar cohorts were known to occasionally pull pranks such as putting popcorn kernels in the heating units and other such partially disruptive but somehow accepted undertakings.

I turned toward my computer monitors and stated "Funny, gentleman" attempting to be affable.  Our monitors all were equipped with cameras that could be accessed on site or remotely and I had assumed that they were watching my reaction to their hijinx.

It was at this point that I realized that the cameras also stored footage for security purposes and I began to access the recordings in order to determine who had installed the false door and when.  Being that there was no possible way they could have done so while I was in the office, I skipped backwards to the previous day after I left in the video log. I confirmed that the door was not present yet, and began fast scanning forward.  I was confused when I reached the morning, and more confused when the timecode approached this past hour.  The door had appeared instantaneously 7 minutes before I got up from my desk to leave.  In one frame it was not present, and in the next it was.  

I shot up and turned my back to my monitors facing the new door and I began to examine it closely, first visually and then cautiously approaching it.  It appeared exactly as the original in every detail including scratches, the small dent that was added when new equipment was moved in last week, and even the frame and thin space beneath it were exact save for one detail.  The light coming through the base of the new doorframe was red. It was not bright or intense, but there was a clear red hue that could be seen at the base of the door.
This is when the noise began.  There was a bump against this new door.  At first it was solitary, sounding as if a ball had hit the other side of the door.  Then the bumping noises increased in frequency. The sounds were random almost similar to a fish flopping on a desk.

My initial reaction was to open the door, as it almost felt impolite not to do so.  I stopped myself and took a much needed moment to ponder the situation.  I closed my eyes, took off my glasses and pinched the bridge of my nose as I went over the facts in my mind and where they may lead.  Although clearly subject to information bias, I concluded that the recent experiment had somehow created this effect. The effect being the duplication of a solid structure in my office.  Unbelievable, however the evidence clearly suggested it as the most plausible causation.  As far as the red light beneath the second door I concluded that it must be generated by some type of safety lighting system in between the walls of the building.  I had never seen nor heard of safety lighting being installed inside a wall, however it would be useful when the staff were wiring.

I decided to investigate and prove my hypothesis regarding the light and rose to open the door.  

The door was no longer present.

I was as shocked by the disappearance of the door as I was of it's original appearance. It was at this point that I decided to leave.  I collected my things, left the office, went down the hall, outside to the parking garage and drove home quite hastily.  

When I arrived home I was plagued by the thoughts of the day's events but tried very hard to be present with my wife and son and take comfort in the fact that the anomaly was no longer existent, and my world was restored to sanity.  I read to my son, tucked him in for the night and spoke to my wife for some time before she also turned in, at which point I took a bath and prepared for bed myself.  The bath had helped me calm my mind further. I had in a matter of hours allowed myself to mentally compartmentalize today's event and move on with the remainder of my work and life.

That is, until I left the bathroom and saw the two doors in my bedroom.

Subject: Final Status	

____________________________________________

Greeting Mrs. Brenson,

My name is Lori Steinman.  I am a regional claims specialist for Sunfire Insurance company and I have been put in charge of your account.  Typically these claims are handled by our junior staff but due to the unique nature of this particular case, Sunfire Insurance wanted to ensure beyond all double that this matter was handled both efficiently and completely.

I have spent the last week working closely with the Maynardville police department, the local fire department as well as our internal claims investigation staff.  As i'm sure you know there have been many questions regarding the details of the incident that lead to the loss of the property on Red Oak Road.  At this point however we feel that enough information has been gathered to secure a ruling regarding cause and liability in this case, and I am emailing you today regarding the final status of the claim.

Before we get to this, I want to sincerely extend my condolences to you regarding the loss of your brother and his partner.  I cannot imagine what you are going through during this troubled time and I want you to know that all of us here share your pain and wish you the best during your period of grief.  I am very unfortunate, and very sorry to add to your burden at this period, but company policy regarding the findings of the police and investigators (both internal and external) clearly dictate the outcome of this claim.

Sunfire Insurance is denying the insurance claim for coverage on the home fire due to the following:

According to the local police department and the fire sheriff's office, the property fire at 1823 Red oak Road, Maynardsville on June 8th, 2015 at approximately 12:45am was deemed to be intentional, malicious and caused by the resident or residents.

I understand that this is likely to come as a shock to you, but the evidence found was unmistakable.  After an exhaustive search of the remains of the property the fire inspectors tracked down the origin point.  They found that the electrical socket on the Eastern end of the master bedroom was the source of the fire.  Normally an electrical fire would be fully covered, however the cause of this particular electrical fire was a small butter knife which had been bent and inserted into the outlet.

The police and fire department did report that they had seen cases where there was accidental insertion of objects in this manner, however our final assessment is that the fact that the knife was bent in half, and both ends were positioned quite clearly to fit the outlet rules out any chance of accident in this case.

Furthermore the police have determined that in all likelihood, this action was taken by a resident or both residents of the home.  There were no signs of break in and no police reports of strange activity from the tenants or the neighbors.  Furthermore it seems that your brother and partner only knew one resident of Maynardsville who was quickly cleared of suspicion.  There are no other suspects who may have had intention to do the residents harm.

It is therefore the determination of the police department, fire department and our company that on the night of June 8th, 2015 at approximately 12:45am one of the two residents of the property in question intentionally bent a knife, inserted it into the electrical socket in the master bedroom, and then got into bed.  As you know they were subsequently both fatally injured in the resulting fire.  I want to share that the fire department confirmed that they likely suffered little or no pain, being that they were suffocated by smoke and unconscious prior to their fatalities.

In regards to contents, there was very little remaining.

The vehicle parked at the property has been released from police impound and you may arrange pickup or sale at your convenience.  The remaining salvageable items are being handled by our fire mediation specialists, are available for delivery, and include:

- Several ceramic pieces from the kitchen including tea pots, cups and ephemera.

- Brass and stone planters from the front garden.

- The entire contents of the potting shed in the back yard including potting materials, and yard tools.

- One small antique china doll, and a small decorated box which were found between the exterior brick wall and the cinder block construction in the corner of the master bedroom.

I again want to offer my sincerest condolences for your loss and the grief that must accompany this information.  If you have any questions regarding our findings you may request the investigation packet of information which will provide you with crime scene photos, police reports, fire inspection reports and other supporting materials.
We at Sunfire Insurance appreciate your patronage, and are available at any time to answer any further questions you may have regarding this claim or anything further.

Thank you and be well. </TEXT>

Subject: Ok I have no idea what to do here	

____________________________________________

To be honest things are really not going well, and Leah and I have been completely out of sorts for the past few days.  We're exhausted, fighting constantly and just generally having a really rough time.  I don't want to unload on you, but you've always been supportive and I don't really know anyone here that I can talk to about this stuff.  Beyond the fighting and relationship problems we've had some really really weird things going on here, that I don't think I would ever tell anyone else.  I know you won't judge me, and I'm thankful to have your ear.

Jesus, where to start?

The day after I wrote last Leah took off to her acting class and I decided it was the perfect time to try to locate and deal with the rodent problem.  I wasn't ever really going to lie to her if I found rats or signs of them, but there would be a big difference between her seeing them, or coming home after I had dealt with the situation.

So I got a drywall saw, and decided to start low to the floor in the bedroom wall behind the headboard (we are sleeping in Mom's old room).  So I removed a section of the drywall to take a look and see if I could find droppings or nests or whatever might explain all the ruckus we've been hearing.

I found nothing in that section, but continued on the other end of the room, where I did find something really odd, and totally not what I expected.  So I open the wall in the east corner of the room at the floor and there is this shiny pile of stuff sitting there on the floor in the space between the bedroom wall and the exterior of the house.

There were trinkets, some of mom's old jewelry, ribbon, a marble, a little tied up bit of black hair (mine? From my first haircut way back?) and just a bunch of other random little bits and pieces.   I recognized some of them from our childhood like those earrings that mom used always complain that you were taking, and that little "eye of god" think I made out of yarn and popsicle sticks at summer camp.  Poring through the stuff I was a bit freaked out to find a tooth in there as well. I'm assuming it was one of our baby teeth.  I can't say that I liked touching that.  

The really odd thing was that there was absolutely no sign of rodents.  The pile was not shaped like a nest or anything, like you might expect an animal collecting stuff to make one.  There were also no droppings, or scratches in the wood or drywall, pee stains. Nothing. So I had no idea what the heck is in there making noise and collecting stuff from the house at this point, and I had nothing to tell Leah (who is really starting to get touchy at this point, after not sleeping well for so long.)

So I grabbed all of the items and threw them out, since there wasn't anything in there really worth keeping.  I didn't tell Leah about that, figuring it was kind of pointless, but I let her know that I had looked and found no signs of rats, and replaced those sections of drywall.

That night really sucked.  Leah got home in the evening after going out for drinks with some of her classmates and immediately got this displeased, wrinkled look on her face when she walked in and threw her keys on the table.

"Jesus it fucking stinks in here" she threw out immediately.

"Really? I don't smell anything." I didn't. I'm not the cleanest person in the world, but it's not like I left food out or anything.

She let out a disgusted sound and told me she was getting in the shower, and I resigned myself to a very shitty night with a very cranky sleep deprived girlfriend.  I tired to put on Netflix on my laptop to watch a show while she was showering, but every time I turned it on, it started to boot and then just immediately shut off.  Just what I need, a dead laptop which I can certainly not afford to replace.

Then I start hearing Leah shrieking like she was being murdered in cold blood, and jumped up sprinting to the bathroom at full speed.  I swear in that moment, all I wanted to do was to stop that horrible noise.  It felt like the whole county must be able to hear it.  I tear open the shower curtain to find her crouching in the tub absolutely covered in red and black muck, crying.  And this time, I could definitely smell it, it stunk to high heaven.

It seemed like maybe it was rust with the red-orange material, but that doesn't really explain the black crap or the horrible stench.  I was pretty sure there was no way that sewage lines could cross over into the water supply pipes, but then I remembered that this house has a well.  So it looks like now we need to have that looked at too.

So, we used some old throw-away towels to get her cleaned up   ended up driving out and buying a gym membership, just so she could take a decent shower.  The water quality improved a little bit in the house, but it was still running brown on and off after that initial deluge.

God, I'm sorry this is so long I'll try to wrap it up.

So we get home from the gym, not really talking and go to bed. You've been married for a while, I'm sure you're familiar with that cold silence in bed, where neither person can sleep but both pretend to.

We finally start to go down, and then it frigging starts.  Not scratching this time, but tapping.  Like this fast tapping noise, in bursts of a couple seconds, on and off.

"What are they doing" I hear Leah ask, half asleep.

"You hear that?"

Leah sits up rubbing her eyes and looking around.  "Yeah, what is that?".

The noise happens on and off for like 10 minutes as we struggle to listen. 30 little taps, and then nothing, then 10 more taps and then nothing.  This time it sounded like it was coming from the kitchen, and I figured I must have scared off whatever it was from the wall that morning.

Before i know it, Leah is out of bed switching all the lights on. 
"Oh my god, fuck this" and she headed toward the kitchen turning on every light along the way and muttering angrily.

I have to admit, I was paralyzed. With her out of bed, and me being alone in the room, I didn't budge an inch.  After a few seconds of silence I was about to call out to her when she beat me to the punch.  

All of a sudden she was at the bedroom door absolutely screaming full tilt "Oh very fucking funny, you fucking asshole!" and she throws something at me in the bed which hits me full in the face.

"What the fuck?" I ask as I taste blood in my mouth and start to tongue my front lip.  Looking down I see Mom's old white china clown doll in my lap, some of my blood on it's face, and I look up at her questioningly.

"Don't even" she crossed her arms. "I can't sleep, you're being an asshole, I get showered with shit, and you think it's funny to set me up like that?  What the fuck are you thinking?"

I've pissed her off in the past, but I've never seen her like this in my life.  I took a second to calm down and wipe the blood from my face before slowly calmly telling her "Leah, look at me.  I have no idea what you're talking about".

"The fucking clown.  You positioned it on the table like it was opening your little dream box or whatever.  Are you trying to freak me out or what?  Why would you do that?"

"What? I didn't do that."

She just looked at me disbelieving, and then threw up her hands.  She turned and I heard the front door slam, and then the car starting.  I tossed the doll and ran outside just in time to see her tearing down the road.

I sat down and waited for a couple hours, hoping she'd come back but she didn't.  I tried calling her, but I could hear her cell phone ring inside the house.  After a while I submitted to trying to get some sleep alone.  When I got back in the house, I cleaned up my face with spring water from the fridge, and grabbed a rag to clean up Mom's doll since I thought it might be worth something to someone.

Only I couldn't find it.  It wasn't in the bed, or under it.  After 20 minutes I gave up looking, and decided that maybe Leah had grabbed it when she left or something. Honestly, I was freaked out.  I kept trying to tell myself that she must have taken it, but I swear she didn't leave the doorway or bend over or anything.  And I'm pretty positive it was in my lap and I threw it after she left.

The rest of the night was quiet in the house, but I didn't sleep a wink.  I just rolled around all night.

Anyway, she called me an hour ago, she had slept in the car, drove around this morning and is heading back now.  We didn't really talk about anything real other than trying to make up and me trying to comfort her.  I honestly don't know what to say to her when she gets back.  And frankly I still have no idea what the hell happened.

I'm wondering if maybe Bob Blakemoore had come in and left that doll on the table or something.  He is always leaving his carvings with people.

Shit, anyway I'm gonna clean up.
I'll be in touch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I appreciate your concern.  I don't want to come off like a jerk but the fact is, I'm just not into any sort of religious or spirit stuff.  Seems to me that if those were real experience they would have been exposed to the light of day at this point, with cell phone camera's etc.

Occam's razor right?  

We're in an old house with bad wiring that hasn't been lived in since my Mom passed months ago.  Hey! Actually you may have just REALLY helped me figure something out!!!

It's got to be the Rats probably chewing on the wires!  I didn't even consider that till just now. THANK YOU for helping me think this through!  The rats are causing both the scratching AND the electric problems, totally makes sense!

Thank you! </TEXT>

Subject: Some Issues	

____________________________________________

Thanks for your reply.  I'm really glad to hear that Justin is feeling better.  I've heard that fevers at that age can be really crazy scary.  I'm sure you dealt with it well and I wish him a speedy recovery.  Tell him his uncle thinks he's a warrior!

I am so not complaining, but holy crap mom had a LOT of stuff.  Leah and I have been working like 12 hour days just going through clothes, boxes, drawers and doing our best to sort out mementos from trash, from stuff we might be able to sell on Ebay.  Think we're gonna make a small fortune on those old orange juice cups with the star wars characters on them.  Might be able to make a living off of the geek crowd!

You asked how things are going, so I wanted to give you an update.  

Honestly, things have been a bit weird over here.  You said mom didn't ever mention anything about rodents or whatever, but we've honestly not gotten a decent night's sleep since we got here.  It seems to be getting worse too.  It ramped up to the point where every hour or so at night there's this scratching noise that seems to be right in the room with us.  It seems really loud, but maybe it's because we're asleep and it's so quiet out here.  Then when we sit up or make any kind of movement or noise it just stops dead.

I swear Leah and I must have sat up in bed and just looked at eachother apprehensively for like 2 full minutes 10 times last night.  She is now totally convinced that it's rats, and furthermore she thinks they must have had babies.  That would explain the increase but I still think her phobia is getting the better of her.

She insisted that I do something about it, so I'm going to head to home depot tonight and get some tools so that I can open up some of the wall behind the headboard and check it out.  I'll have to do it when Leah's out at her class so I can "Say hello to my leeetle friend" :)

So one more question.  The lights.  There seems to be a problem with the electricity.  Did mom ever mention that?  I know you  talked to her a lot more near the end than I did.  Honestly if she mentioned anything about any issues in the house, can you try to remember and let me know?

Every once in awhile they flicker or dim.  At first I figured it was brownouts (this is a really rinky dink town) but it's been going on since we got here.  Once in awhile it seems like we get a surge or something as well.  The lights will just go super bright for a second, or the tv will turn on all of a sudden and I'll catch this weird burning smell.  

I don't want to make this your problem, just wondering if Mom mentioned anything.  Starting to expect aliens showing up at this point or something.  Oooh maybe it's the Grey's scratching at our walls to test our reflexes!  I'll have to ask Whitley Streiber. Ha.

Oh God, I almost forgot.  You'll never believe who we saw today. Here's your hints: Corn Cob pipe? straw hat? Feeding us candy cigarettes by the carton?

You got it!  I'm standing in the kitchen doing the dishes and I almost fall over.  Bob Blakemoore is literally pressing his wrinkled face against the kitchen window right in front of me. So once he had completely freaked me out we got him in through the front door and had coffee and reminisced for almost an hour. 

He was really sweet as always, and told me that the year he spent living with us after Dad died was the best year of his life. He's still smells of whiskey and tobacco, still smoking a corn cob pipe and still after all these years has those piercing light blue eyes.  It was really something to see him again, and believe it or not as he was leaving he pulled a little carved wooden dog from his pocket and gave it to me, just like when we were kids.  He must whittle ten of those things every single day and give them to everyone he comes across.

He talked a lot about you as well and we laughed for a while once he found out that you became a lawyer.  He snorted and said "That girl. Boy she loved to argue, every single minute of every day".  I think he had you pegged from the beginning. Anyway I filled him in on your family, kids, career and everything else.  He told me to make sure that I sent his regards.


Well, I'm really beat.  I'm going to try to get to bed early tonight and get some sleep before the nightly ruckus starts up again and I have to soothe Leah and try to convince her that it's definitely cute bunnies in the walls and not rats.

Chat soon!

I'm going to open the wall soon and see what I see.

And dude, you are going to freak Leah out with that creepy nightmare stuff and your theories.  That's the last thing I need to deal with.  Once I find out what's in the wall this will all be settled. </TEXT>

Subject: We've arrived!

____________________________________________

Hey Sandy!


I want to make sure you have my new email address.  I'm using this one now since I left that job in Atlanta.

So, Leah and I arrived safely yesterday and we're getting all setup here.  The move was pretty easy, it only took one small U-haul truck.  It was weird to think that all of my possessions fit in the one big rolling box, but I guess I always was a bit of a free spirit.

I have to say, it is really strange being back here, the house hasn't really changed at all.  How many years did mom live in a house with both of our rooms almost completely intact?  Feeling a bit sad about that now, thinking about her passing our childhood bedrooms every day to get to the bathroom.  I guess when you're a parent you never really let go.  You'd know better than I (PS: how are the kids?).

I want to thank you for dealing with the estate paperwork, that was a huge load off and I am much more suited toward dealing with the house and her stuff.  Not to mention I need to thank you again, and again for agreeing to let us live here. I never thought that Leah and I would own a home together, and least of all our old house.  It means a lot that you'd give up the sale profit for now so that we could try to start a family here.

Anyway, I was thinking of you today.  I ran out to grab some cleaning supplies and when I got back you won't believe what was sitting on the kitchen table.  My old nightmare box!  Remember you brought that wooden box back from Salem when Grandma and Grandpa took you there for Halloween?  I think that was the first gift you ever got me. We were what like 8 and 12?

I was so happy that day.  Remember how I always used to wake you up every time I had a nightmare?  Then one night you suggested that I should "put" the nightmare in that box and close it instead of crawling into bed with you?  Totally worked, I would do it every night picturing the images in my nightmare being shut into and trapped into that box.  You learned those parenting skills pretty early with me :)

Anyway, Leah found it in my old bedroom   was checking it out.  I think she was hoping there was some money or some weed in there or something.  She thought it was pretty cute when I told her what it actually was, and it was quite a stroll down childhood memory lane.

Oh hey, I wanted to ask you.  Did mom say anything about rodents or problems in the house before she passed?  We both got woken up last night by this crazy scratching sound that seemed like it was coming from the walls.  Leah is really freaked out by rats, and I really hope that's not it.  I could deal with a squirrel or something, but if it's rats I might need to keep that quiet and take care of it without her knowing. She'll definitely freak out.

Ok, I feel like I'm rambling now.  
I just wanted to touch base   let you know that we're taking care of things here.  I'll be in touch soon.

Ciao!

<TEXT> I am sooooo psyched!  Today was the big day and I just can't help but share it with someone!  I can't tell anyone else, so I'm totally sending it to the anonymous interwebs instead!  Please please please leave replies! You're gonna be the only people who know.

Today was my sweet sixteen.  We had a great party, all of my besties were there, and even though my Dad was totally being ridiculous and emotional we managed to have an awesome time.  Amy, Sandra and Divan we're totally styling, dressed to the hilt and crazy happy with the snacks and drinks (virgin of course, thanks to Dad). We hung out, ran around, dipped in the pool and partied like all day, it was soooo fun.  Oh yeah, and mom totally splurged and bought me an awesome dress, I was beyond hot, and all the boys that came were totally bugging out.

Anyway, that was really cool, but it was nothing compared to the gift I got myself after the party.  I'm getting goosebumps again just thinking about it.

I know this sounds totally uppity, but I'm special.  I was just born that way and I can tell that lots of people see it.  They crowd around me, want to be near me like all the time.  There's just something I've always had. I'm different.  And special people have to take care of themselves.  I read that in this book that my mom has.  Mostly it's filled with silly hippie junk, but there was this thing about a goose that lays golden eggs, and if the goose doesn't take care of itself, it can't make any more.  Totally hit me, and I started planning my gift to myself.  Gotta make sure I take care of that goose!

So after my party, after my mom and dad went to bed and my friends left I got ready.  I went makeup crazy first and totally smeared my face.  There was no way anyone would recognize me, I totally looked like some freaky clown, that like got caught in a rainstorm or something.  I covered my hair with a black beach hat, got dressed in my black dance leotard grabbed my shoulder bag   headed out.

Sneaking out was easy just like always, but I had to walk like 2 miles cuz I wanted to get far away from my house.  I'm special but I'm not stupid or crazy! LOL!

This is where the fun started!  It's so silly, and I know I'm a bit old for it, but I started playing eenie-meenie with the houses.  Feeling so silly, but kinda cool too.  I landed my little finger on a small ranch house, which looked perfect.  I wanted to do this by chance, leave it up to the universe ya know, but this place was dark and small, and there was probably only one or two people who lived there.

There were no cars driving around at all which was perfect. It was really easy to get behind the house without anyone seeing me, and boom! Totally found a window cracked open!!! This was soooo meant to be.

I lifted myself and climbed into the window that was over the kitchen sink.  No sound at all, I was a total ninja.  My ballet shoes made no noise at all, as I walked around the house like i was taking a tour.  I was pretending that I was gonna buy the place, thinking about all the crappy cupboards and carpet like my Mom did when before we bought our house.  Too bad those totally hot dudes from house hunters weren't there. LOL!

I was solid, not scared at all and messed around looking at pictures, the food in the fridge and the magazines and stuff piled up near the couch in the living room.  I was pretty sure this was a single dude and when I got into the bedroom I was totally right.  One dude, like 30 something, kinda fit but a bit redneck. He was asleep, snoring like a freight train, face down on his bed.  His back had no gross hair or anything, but it was all pimply. Kinda disgusting.

I opened up my bag and grabbed the ice pick (my grandfather would have freaked out, it used to be his before he croaked.) Then I took a second to breath and be really ready.  I wanted to really take it all in and make sure I enjoyed my gift here.  This was like the only time I was ever gonna do this and I had to make sure I remembered it! Right?

"Happy birthday to me." I whisper-sang and then I leaned on the ball of the ice pick, pushing into the guy's back.  I swear! I almost totally blacked out, it was such a RUSH!!!

Dude sounded like a fish gasping and trying to turn over, and I knew I did it just right, just like in that youtube video I saw.. I got the pick right in his lung! (Of course, I'm awesome. applause, applause..)

I pulled out the pick and let him turn over.  His eyes were all like "what what? Who who?"

"Awww. You're a little owl with those eyes" I said. (ha! I was sooo cool, just so me right then.)

I put on my pouty face and then I went like totally angry-crazy!  I stabbed and stabbed and stabbed, like all over.  He flopped like a fish and I got him in the belly, in the chest, in the arms sometimes, and I even aimed for his cock once but that wasn't that fun really.

Blood started shooting out of some of the hole (but not others which was weird) but I just kept going and going.  It was so Hot!  I totally get how dudes love plunging into girls now.  I don't think any of my friends will ever understand it like I do now.  

Then it all stopped. The dude went still, I got really tired and then we just cuddled for a while.  I curled up all tired and put my arms around him and it was like total bliss.  I soaked it all in and sighed.

So this was the one! The biggest ever pressie to me! I got a present that like NOONE ever gets.  Did something totally cool and totally unique, and I will alway always always have this memory.

When I'm like 50 and chillin' on a yacht with like Hollywood stars I'll have this with me.  I am like super awesome, super powerful and nobody can ever ever take this away.

Anyway.. I'm 16 now! Totally gonna take on the world! Wish me a happy birthday, it was an awesome one!

<TITLE> She rode me home </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There was a time in my life where I had wanted nothing more than to leave this harsh world.  I was 15 years old and was utterly and completely alone in the world.  My grandmother cared for me and though she did her very best, but was simply not equipped for properly caring for me.  I had no true friends, only acquaintances that were sometimes friendly, but mostly kept me around to fill the role of a whipping post.

I was overweight, unattractive, too sloppy to be grouped with the popular or athletic kids in my High School.  I was too dull and quiet to be seen as interesting with the geek crowd, and I was far too much of a social pariah to be popular with the girls in my neighborhood.  In short I had nothing going for me, and chose to just embrace it, and find comfort in solitude.

I had always been in poor physical shape (I like to blame my Italian grandmother who considered pasta and cheese to be the mainstay of every meal) but as slow as I was, I began to take to long walks through the woods on the outskirts of our town.  These were deep, lush woods heightened in color and thickness by the moist Pennsylvania air.  I always found the wet rock faces, and rich moss to be very soothing for me as I explored the winding creeks, riverbeds and complex weaving game trails of what I always called the "dark forest".

Over the year of 1992 I had explored these game lands fully time and time again to the point where I could walk the trails in my own mind before going to sleep, which I did often to assist with my insomnia at the time.  There was no corner of that area that i did not know intimately.  Because of this I was very surprised when one day I pushed through some brambles at the eastern edge of the fishing hole, to find a small clearing which I did not recognize whatsoever.

The clearing was only maybe nine feet across and thickly surrounded by thick Maples almost completely blocking light from entering the refuge inside.  I immediately felt an intense love of this spot, along with a strange growing uneasiness about how encapsulated it truly felt. I was at once both a moth who had finally embraced a flame, and a butterfly suddenly ensnared under a glass dome.

My reverie was quickly dispersed as I fell backward hard onto my tailbone, the instant my mind recognized the shape of a young woman sitting and sobbing at the center of the small clearing.

"Ma fuh." I so eloquently uttered as I fell, sounding like a mentally challenged cartoon character.  

At this, the waify towheaded young woman looked up, eyes teared over and examined me as I both backed away and attempted to regain my composure and my footing.  She looked at me pleadingly through her obvious pain, questioning and hope beginning to light her face.

She was my height and maybe 90 pounds soaking wet, wearing a simple thin white dress, and apparently nothing else.  Her hair was light and blonde almost to the point of being white, and her features beyond fair.  She was barefoot and bare legged, though there was not a trace of dirt or grime on her alabaster limbs.  To every extent she was delicate and beautiful save for one very odd feature which did not ruin her appearance, so much as accentuate her other perfections.  Her eyebrows were thick and as black as could be, and flared wildly across her brow seeming to extend into, and jut out past her hairline, pointing outward from her temples.

"Haallo" her small intricate drawn out voice was subtle and enchanting.

"Hello".  This was the extent of my charm, and ability to deal with this unusual encounter.

Her eyes rolled slightly upward and her lips began to curl slightly into a smile, as she slowly reached out a thin hand toward me, inviting me toward her.

At this point, I was at my feet but feeling a bit apprehensive.  My eyes darted around, as if this was some trick being played upon me, and I was being lured into a trap to be beaten by some of the more aggressive kids in my school.  I could hear and feel my heart pound and then pause, and the hair on my arms stand on end. 

In the end, this trepidation turned quickly into cautious excitement.

As likely seems clear, I had never been very popular with the female gender and certainly had never been an object of their interest.  But here, suddenly, there was only me and the lovely creature, and she was in some kind of trouble or pain, and was reaching out to me.  I cannot say that I was lured by any sort of expectation, but I was certainly intrigued, enchanted an steeled myself to not allow this strange opportunity to pass unfulfilled.

I swallowed hard, and stepped toward her, slowly reaching out my hand so as not to scare her, and gently took her hand in mind.  This connection was overwhelming, and the warmth of her hand in mine was like nothing I had felt before.  My heart swelled at the feeling of that warm (no that feverishly hot) appendage in my palm.

"Are you ok" I inquired caringly.

She only smiled, and raised her other hand to caress my cheek, and then my neck.  The heat from her hands was overwhelming, and the touch was all encompassing.  Her right hand continued to explore my neck, pull on my ears, push soft and then hard upon my chest as I consciously tried to let go of the shame I had for my own body and fully be in this moment.

Things progressed so quickly. It was a delicious blur of heat, exploration and passion as we kissed, caressed, undressed bit by bit, our bodies responding, and before I could think for a moment, for the first time ever I was making love.  I was making love to a beautiful young woman in these woods that were my refuge without shame or fear or anything other than ecstasy.

She had pushed me to the ground in the center of the clearing, and was riding me slowly and then faster as our passion increased.  I swooned as she bit her lip staring upward at the sky and blood began to trickle from her thin lips.

This sight pushed me to the edge, and I could not stop myself from immediate expenditure.  As my head cocked back and eyes began to roll I was startled as she quickly jumped off of me and put her cupped right hand between her legs, scooping the fluids now amassed there.  She then quickly spat the blood from her mouth into this same hand and shouted something indeterminable as she flung the collection of fluids onto the ground above my head.

What happened then, I am at a loss to accurately describe.  In a blur of motion and overwhelming sensual impact of sound, light and even smell, the trees about us fell away, the ground breathed and moved beneath my back, the sky darkened and lightened assaulting my eyes, and the pressure of gravity upon my body, which I had never felt or considered before pulled at me and then released it's grip slightly but noticeably.

At once I felt as if I was in a confused dream.  Around us were plains of searing crimson brush like no other vegetation I had ever seen.  Small lights like fireflies migrated through the air and even through our bodies in the thousands as I took in the strange collection of shrieks, clicking noises and piping in the distance.  The ground beneath me was wavering and gelatinous but I was not pressed into it as my body felt lighter and almost frictionless against it.  As I tried to turn over i found that the push I made upon the earth (or what I still choose to call earth regardless of the obvious change in environment) was enough to send my body reeling upward toward the enormous leaf shaped wisps a hundred feet above our heads.

Her quick but gentle hand caught my pant leg and she effortlessly pulled me back toward the ground and she secured my position with both hands.  She then rose them to my face, holding it gently and whispered to me, peering directly into my eyes.

"I am home, and I thank"

I flinched as she dug her fingernails into my lip, slapped her hands together and then smacked me hard, directly on the forehead with a great cracking noise, that sent me falling backward onto the hard ground.

The hard ground.  The trees.  The stones. The thick moist air of the Pennsylvania forest, in that small clearing, where I visit time and time again, for the hope, for the chance of seeing my lost love, who I helped to return home, but will never, ever forget.

<TEXT> I know that writing this is pointless.  I know that it will likely be of no help whatsoever.  At this point I'm left decided between trying and not, doing something or just accepting the fact that I will never find solace in sleep, or in a dark room for the rest of my days, marked as they are.

I'm going to try.  I'm going to convince myself right here and now that maybe, by the grace of some higher power that If I share this story with someone it may relieve some of the burden that I have carried for the past two years.  Perhaps writing this down and putting this out to the world will exorcise the fear and horror from my subconscious and bring this darkness into the light.  Perhaps the onus of the scarred mark on my chest will feel a bit lighter, more surreal in the light of day.

It was a dream come true.  After years of scrimping and saving my wife Rebecca and I had finally reached a point where we could take our first vacation in several years.  We were ecstatic to arrive in Madrid in the spring time, check into our hostel and begin to eat our way through the city.  Our plan was to tour the entire country of Spain over 14 days beginning and ending in Madrid.

Our lives had always been defined by chaos.  We managed small businesses, were heavily involved in the lives or our two children, took part in community organizations, read, crafted and generally drove ourselves through life, experiencing everything we could at every turn.  On this trip we decided to spend out time without a plan, to take each thing as it came, to drive through the countryside and do whatever caught our fancy in the moment.  Finally we would spend some time not pushing ourselves and just seeing where the world may take us.

Our trip was immediately marked by both wonderful and tricky situations.  On our first night in Madrid both of our cellphones were stolen by a young thief.  The skill at which this young man asked for directions and set his paper map upon our outdoor dining table was without measure, and it took hours for us to realize that both of our cell phones had been on the table and were now missing.  Shortly thereafter we found an old egyptian temple that had been moved from Egypt stone by stone and placed in park in the city.  This was an astounding place, so out of character for the city, but historic and wonderful.

Our trip went on like this for a week as we drove the small rental car up north to Bilbao and visited the Guggenheim, further east near France to experience the wonderful outdoor restaurants and exceptional food, and then south toward Valencia.  At each turn we randomly and freely found incredible experiences, places to be, things to see and quite often wonderful meals and Spanish wines to consume.

Wonder after wonder, we were enchanted again as we drove from Valencia toward the beaches of Malaga to see off in the distance some very interesting ruins.  I remember my wife looking over at me inquiringly and then both of us smiling knowingly as we took the closest exit and made our way up the hill toward this destination.  We quickly found ourselves navigating very narrow, ancient stone lined streets through a quaint little village and were overwhelmed by the historicity of this town.  Parking the car on a small dirt lot we hiked the remaining half a mile up the hillside overlooking the village and explored the minimal remains of a moorish castle that stood at the top of the hill.  

I remember the sun shining at the very edge of the only remaining complete wall of the castle, pulsing as it started to fall behind the corner of this magnificent structure.  The grounds in front of the wall, which would have been the interior of the castle were broken stone leading close to the edge of the cliff where sat a single almond tree, gripping the dirt of the cliff's edge for fear of falling over.  The strangest thing about the ruin was that the wall that did stand complete, had a very large entrance where you would imagine thick wooden doors to be hung.  The doors were likely long ago destroyed and in their place was hung thick canvas, darkened by the dust and arid weather of the Spanish climate.  This hanging seemed very out of place, and my wife and I pondered and talked about why someone might hang this in the entrance of these ruins.  We could come up with no good reason, but continued to poke around and enjoy the environment, and the view from the hilltop.

When we finally decided to get back on the road, we headed down into the village below and started heading towards the car.  It was at this point we started noticing that on several roads through the village were hung streamers, and on other roads there were large wooden blockades painted blue.  

Rebecca turned to me, "Wait, there's something happening here today.  Let's stay."

The sound of a small engine entered my consciousness as a small old gentleman rode up to us on a scooter.  His small dog sat upon the floor of the dusty vehicle between his feet and the back was a bundle of buckets strapped with bungee cord.  The man parked, smiled at us with a wide grin and took a bucket and trundled over to us with a very welcoming look.

Rebecca and I spoke no Spanish and this man did not know English, but through a series of clumsy gestures and sounds we understood that today was a festival day.  As we attempted to communicate about the festival he fed us delicious fresh figs that he had picked from the fields outside the village.  They were warm from the hot sun that day and were a wonderful treat.

We were then lead over the barriers and into the main street where the occupants of the village gathered, and were astounded when a large bull was lead by a rope into the street with us and let loose.  We anxiously laughed and ran through the streets with the collection of european youths as the bull snorted and charged, turned and bucked for near to an hour.  This was an exceptional experience and we were giddy with falling upon this random happening.  

As the sun began to set, the bull was pulled back into a fenced area and the crowd began to disperse, as did we.  As we walked away from the main street we heard a single gunshot, and realized that this was likely how this festival ended, with the killing of the animal.  We tried not to judge, but that shot set a darkness over the event that we did not expect.

Before we reached the car, we once again ran into the small man who we had met earlier.  He offered us each one more fresh fig and bowed low as if to say goodbye.  Unable to refuse one last taste of these exotic fruit, we savored them on our tongues.  Almost as instantly my world went dark, and I only remember wondering why the ground in front of me was lurching toward my face.

+++

When my eyes opened once more, my mind struggled to assemble the image of the castle upon the hill which we had visited earlier.  I turned and searched my surroundings to find that I was gagged and bound in place, tightly tied to the Almond tree on the cliff's edge, inches from my wife.  We had been stripped completely naked and I felt the warm night air upon my body as I took in the scene before us.

We were facing the curtained opening of the ruin's wall, and between us and the opening were three men, two in black robes on either side of the doorway, and one in a crimson robe directly between us and the canvas curtain in the doorway.  The two men in black robes each had buckets near to them, and were chanting in low tones as they cautiously tossed figs between our tree and the opening as if marking a walkway with rose petals.

I cannot say what I felt in this moment.  I recall the whimpers and sounds of struggling around me but I have no concept of whether they came from me, Rebecca or both of us.  There was only thick and heavy panic and pulling at our binds as I tried to comprehend what was happening before us.  

The man in Crimson approached us, his face in the shadow of his hood, and the small knife in his hand catching the glint of the moonlight as it was lifted towards my wife.  The shriek that left my body as he cut into my wife between her breasts will haunt me forever.  It was an unearthly sound that was so unnatural streaming from my vocal cords and being warped and tangled by the gag in my mouth.  My eyes teared instantly and I gripped my eyelids shut as I heard my love cry and then moan through her gag.  When her sobbing began to subside I opened my eyes to see the small symbol letting blood upon her chest, and the man in Crimson beginning the same work upon my body.   

I am not a proud man, but I can simply report that I was able to remain calm and silent as the man drew the knife upon my chest, cutting a small circle and two horns between upon my solar plexus.  I was likely less fearful due to the fact that I had first seen the extent of this actions upon my wife before I, a fact of which I am certainly not proud.

This work completed, the man in Crimson dropped his knife upon the stone at his feet, slowly turned away from us toward the opening, and shouted something indistinguishable as he raised his arms high in the air with much fervor.  We saw no-one very close to the opening but at that moment the canvas burst into intense flames, and as the smoke cleared we could see the multitude of stars though the opening.

These were not our stars.

I have no proof, no description, no understanding of how or why I felt this so intensely in that moment. I can only state, as a fact that the night sky through this doorway was not ours.  They were misaligned, skewed, shifting and corrupt.  Just seeing this small swath of ill omened stars turned my stomach and I began to fear that I would choke on my own vomit, held by the rag in my mouth. 

Thunder began to shake the mountain top.  The wind began to howl and the smell of ozone filled my nostrils, as I began to notice that stars were being blacked out in the doorway before us.  One after another, beginning at the ground, blackness overtook layer upon layer of starlight, and a shape began to take form.  I could begin to make out the shape of a large lumbering oval backed beast approaching from the other side of the door as the chanting of the robed men began to rise.

For a moment rain blasted the hilltop on one quick sweep.  The wind spun, the thunder increased in volume and intensity,  The ruins became chaos as branches and dust flew through the air in confusion.  I struggled to pull my wrists from the binds, as I trained my mind to be ready to free Rebecca and not become lost in fear and immediate escape.

The ominous pitch dark shape of an other-worldly Bull began to emerge from the gate and into the ruins.  It's slick black coat seemed to be covered in sweat, or oil, or some organic fluid as it bucked and snorted and fought the air as if it was somehow constrained. The man in crimson was chanting louder and louder, hands raised as if encapsulating the animal as it slowly approached him and us.

I had never been religious, or believed in anything outside of what I could see hear and prove at this point of my life.  But at this point I was faced with the unexplainable.  I was faced with a madness and a horror that made me lose every preconceived notion I had ever have about the sanity or trust in the natural order of our world.  

I prayed.
I pleaded. I begged.  I gave myself up.  I let myself go. I in that moment accepted the complete loss of myself, without holding back.

There was only immediate darkness for me.  And then there was immeasurable light.

Looking back afterwards I realize that at that very moment, what had actually occurred was that lightning had struck the tree to which Rebecca and I were tied.  There was darkness, then light and then freedom.  In the chaos of the moment, as the tree split and fell behind us, I was able to fully free and ungag  myself and Rebecca.  In the confusion I saw that man in Crimson turn toward us enraged, and at that moment saw the bull break free of it's invisible fetters, charge and impale him upon it's midnight black horns.  Blood poured from the already crimson robes as the two men in black, Rebecca and I each ran down the sandy path of the hill.

We never looked back up at the ruins, there was only running for us.  Naked, bleeding, and tearing full speed through the fig fields, Rebecca and I looked only forward until exhaustion overtook us completely.  I have no concept for how many hours passed as we ran, for how we stayed together though the mad flight, or how we found ourselves sinking into delirious sleep in the fields close to the main road together.

I only know that we awoke at sunrise, torn up by a multitude of lacerations from the trees, completely naked and with a darkness in our souls that we had never had thought possible.

As you must imagine, we reached the road and found assistance, avoided the authorities and eventually found ourselves back home, mostly unharmed outside of the marks upon our breasts, and the unbeknownst horror in our hearts which we have never yet shared with anyone.

There is only one thing for us now.  We are marked.  We carry the seal upon our bodies, every passing day and each sleepless night.  

We know, you see.

We know that this mark is clear, that regardless of where, of when, and of what door that beast may find travel in the future, we are the intended.

<TEXT> I know that writing this is pointless.  I know that it will likely be of no help whatsoever.  At this point I'm left decided between trying and not, doing something or just accepting the fact that I will never find solace in sleep, or in a dark room for the rest of my days, marked as they are.

I'm going to try.  I'm going to convince myself right here and now that maybe, by the grace of some higher power that If I share this story with someone it may relieve some of the burden that I have carried for the past two years.  Perhaps writing this down and putting this out to the world will exorcise the fear and horror from my subconscious and bring this darkness into the light.  Perhaps the onus of the scarred mark on my chest will feel a bit lighter, more surreal in the light of day.

Sharing this with you now, is a tribute to hope and nothing more.

The bottom triangle represents the "fire" of prayer and is often red in color, while the upper triangle (pointing downward, and often blue) represents the divine influence (mana) raining down upon the world.

1) My wife liked it, and we could share it
2) was a "solution" or compromise for my Poly nature

There was no issue of jealousy, things went generally really well and I had a great experience, though my wife was just sort of disinterested in doing it again.  She didn't "get anything out of it".

Additionally, I think we both know that this was not a "patch" for my being Poly and her being Mono. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, after 16 years together, lots of pain, work, discussions and a successful swing-session at a club this past weekend, we have landed at a trial separation.  sad face.  

We have two teenage kids and both live and work together.  We're both very mature, loving and understanding, but it looks like this will break us, at least for now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife and I have been negotiation Poly for almost a year without any action.  We've had lots of up and downs, and it looked really bad for a while.

Tonight she has her first date in 16 years!
Feeling very strong, and I am so happy for her to potentially have a great time, though her interest in seeing others is relatively low.

Really interested in the outcome! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not great.
Been discussing for a year, made some excellent progress was confirmed to be able to go out on a date this week for the first time, with complete honesty and openness (and some positivity).

Then my wife (and center of my life) had an emotional reaction that lead her to trial separate today.  We are now discussing handling the kids while she stays with friends.

Really fucking crushed today.
Don't know what to do other than support her the best I can.

<TEXT> If she can focus, clear her mind and truly and honestly do this small practice, she WILL feel Michael's presence (proof of success in her being fully genuine in her prayers / work) and it certainly will help.

Michael is the Lord's Sledgehammer.

<TEXT> If she is not comfortable with that talisman, it will likely not help or protect her.

My suggestions based on her background is that again, she pray to, light candles to, and place images and items related to Michael around the house, asking Michael for protection and to clear the house of the unwanted influence / presence.

What is important is that she does this in a way that is meaningful and powerful to her.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What is your religious background? Or the background of the new tenants?  If you or they are Christian (or at least closer to Christianity than anything else) I would highly suggest that you focus on calling upon the archangel Michael to clear the space.

Light candles, give offerings, pray, call upon Michael, hang images of him, Ask Michael to bless water and splash it around the house, etc. 

Otherwise, any further info may help.  Communicating with the troublesome entity is not advisable, so stay away from that unless you really know what you're doing. </TEXT>

**Introduction to Alchemical Philosophy**

Penn LGBT Center, 3907 Spruce Street, Philadelphia PA

Alchemy is the quintessential hermetic science. It is a clear embodiment of the well known maxim from the Equinox: The Method of Science, the Aim of Religion. Furthermore it is the foundation for a great deal of the symbolic representation found throughout hermetic writings. A deep understanding of alchemical logic and philosophy is an invaluable tool to any student of the Hermetic Arts. The traditional alchemist is a spiritual scientist, one who investigates the laws of the material world to further understand and develop the soul. Please join Frater Marius for an introduction to alchemical thought, philosophy, and symbolic systems. There is a suggested donation of $5 to cover space rental costs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, this batch was a family effort and not necessarily the cleanest, best rolls that we can make.

But the only advice is practice!  If you want to get good at something, just do it as often as possibe.  Watch some youtube instructional videos, and then focus on one certain type (regular rolls, or inside-out rolls, etc.)

I will say that the first mistake I made was to not thoroughly wash my rice.  Now I hand-wash the rice in water at least 3 or 4 times before cooking it which has greatly improved the quality.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe $20 for the entire meal which fed 3.

We had leftovers as well..... the only problem being that the fridge will ruin the rice, refrigerating left over rolls is really not an option.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have sushi-grade fish at our local Wegmans at the sushi bar.  

Frankly though I have just typically use fresh fish from our Asian grocery without issue.

From what I understand, there are really no FDA requirements for sushi-grade fish that are not already required or suggested by law.
