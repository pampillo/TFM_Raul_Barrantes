<TEXT>  Bush realized halfway through that there would be video of him saying "shame on me" which would be run in election commercials. So, mid-thought he tried to switch gears, and kind of fell on his face.

You sure about that? I mean Bush fooled us once making us think he was competent and well.... you know that old saying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> those who can't get visas because of criminal ties, are the ones who come over the fence, those are the ones that the wall target and I'm okay with that. It will reduce crime.

Not all these people are criminals. It's not like crime lords are hopping the fence to get into America. Crime lords want to stay in Mexico where there's much less law enforcement. The people that are "hopping the fence" (Much more likely traveling through tunnels, on boats, and smuggled in cars) are the lowest income families in Mexico/central america/south america (Mostly CA) that dont have access to amenities such as the internet to apply for visas and are only interested in running from the crime lords of their town.

The amount of actual criminals that are coming across the border is tiny compared to the amount of people. Even if they do have a record Legal and illegal immigrants are both less likely to commit crimes than native born citizens. Why would they immigrate to a place with harsher penalties to try to commit more crime.

<TEXT>  This argument seems to rely on Trump taking no action to change legislation around visa issuance or deportation enforcement.

Trump has hinted at expanding the H1B visa program to look for higher skilled work but i haven't seen him hint toward changes for low skill work. Especially since trump uses these visas to hire people for his own resorts.
Source: http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/28/news/donald-trump-foreign-workers/ 

On deportation he does have ICE deporting people but i dont see it ever greatly reducing the amount of Illegal Immigrants.

Not to mention a 33-50% decrease in illegal immigration is still huge...

Just because you build a wall instead of a fence doesn't mean that 33-50% goes away. A good percentage of those people are definitely not hopping fences. There's still tunnels, boats, and people being smuggled in cars. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Using your logic you're telling me Prisons should drop their fences and walls because they dont work..

Walls are great at keeping people in... not so great at keeping people out.

272+ MILES is small? What?

Yes very small when compared to the 1,989 miles of the U.S-Mexico border.

Are you really suggesting the Berlin Wall and the Great Wall didn't work? The Great Wall helped secured China for many many years, allowed ease of troop movements, long distance communication and still stands to this day. The Berlin wall did hell of a job dividing Germany.

Yes all rose and fell. They did do a great job while they were up but that was during war when they had constant patrolls and they were still toppled. This wall that Trump is proposing is going to cost billions to put up. Hundreds of millions to maintain. And is going to serve what purpose? Keep out hard working mexicans that we inevitably fly over anyway with temporary work visas? or Keep out drugs which are obviously in high demand if they are being smuggled in? Its a ridiculous proposition that if built would only serve to display the racist and prejudice underbelly of America.  </TEXT>

Idk about a 25 year low but illegal Immigration from the southern border has been declining since 2007. This has nothing to do with the wall.

Israel disagrees. Hell. Bel-Air and almost every upscale neighborhood in the country, disagrees.

I'm guessing that this is you saying that you think walls work?? Maybe for small areas like Israel and "Bel-Air" (No clue what you're referring to) but if you want an example of large scale walls failing to enact their intended purpose look no further than China and Berlin.

<TEXT> However, for a typical seasonal farm worker, a 40 percent wage increase could raise earnings from $10,000 for 1,000 hours of work to $14,000  lifting the wage above the federal poverty line.

Ok I know we were discussing prices at supermarkets but I'm going to look at this a different way. What would be the price in the supermarket if we offered livable wages on farms since that is the only way you will get Americans working there.

I'm going to use Texas for my example as Texas contains the most farms for any state in the U.S. The livable wage in Texas is $10.67 ( Source: http://livingwage.mit.edu/states/48 ) (assuming 2080 working hours). But farms are seasonal. Using the above of 1000 hours, the per hour rate to reach the living wage would be $21.77. 

But that's assuming they only have 1 job. Ok lets backtrack and use the 14k from this 40% raise and assume this person picked up another job for the 1080 hours that they were not working on this farm. At minimum wage of $7.25 they would make $7830 if we add this to the 14k from before you end up with $21,830 which is still $363.60 short of living wages. And mind you this is all assuming you're only providing for 1 person.

Now for your price at the supermarket if we assume that you're getting paid living wages from the farm ($21.77) and that is your only job. From the original mark of $10.07 (avg pay from article)
this is a 116% wage increase. The 10 cent farm labor becomes 22 cents and the $1 apple becomes $1.22. 

This is all considering 1 adult trying to make a living. Add a wife who may or may not have a job or add a kid in the mix and this person is right back under the living wage. To top it all off what is being asked is 1000 hours of back breaking work.

<TEXT> If you need to have illegal workers to keep your farm afloat, maybe it needs to go under.

Following this most U.S farms would go under. Then when you go to your supermarket you will have 2 options.

Fruits and vegetables covered in pesticides. or Extremely expensive fruits and vegetables.

Our country would be screwed without illegal immigrants picking our food. These are back breaking jobs and honestly America has become too lazy to do it ourselves.

I'm sure the migrant workers are more loyal and work harder. They don't have a choice.

They absolutely have a choice. They came to work here. No one is forcing these people. They just saw a way to better their lives and are taking it. </TEXT>

This dispute he has raised against illegal immigrants is much like hitler did with jews in the early term of his leadership. He is reaching out to the poorest of our country and telling them that this populace of people is responsible for their hardships when that is demonstrably false. Trump even took a page from hitlers book and decided to compile a list of crimes from his targeted populace and print it out.

But you are right he does represent a sect of our current state as a society and nation but it is not a representation that we should be proud of. </TEXT>

I'm speaking of before that was made into a rule. At one point in time you could bring liquids on in your carry on. Then one guy brought an explosive liquid and now you no longer can.

There's no good reason to prohibit someone from checking one in their luggage, and there's no good reason to prohibit someone from having one outside the secure area.

I understand your point but its always a tricky situation allowing guns into highly populated areas like airports. Ofc you want to allow someone to check their gun but at the same time these places become a target for mass murders. </TEXT>

That is so hard to check. How are you going to keep track of what every customer brings for a carry on.

But because one person does it it should be banned for everyone?

This is literally how the TSA runs. The entire reason you cant bring liquids on a plane is because one person had a liquid explosive.

The law won't prevent this in the future, it just means someone's going to start shooting before they get in the door or once they are out of it.

Or you just go to a different grocery store... sounds like you're trying to create a community of debtors.

so you must somehow be selecting who you feel sorry for and who you don't.

Yes its called a conscience. 

So the government asks government for permission to go onto your property? Still shows who owns the property by who is giving permission. In a private property system, then the owner is the only person that can grant permission.

So say someone is running a meth lab out of their house in a residential neighborhood. Whose to stop them? Will it be perfectly fine since its on their property?

If someone could just default on everything and have nothing happen to them why would they ever pay a bill?

Why do you care about helping the poor then? If you don't think your success is related to their failure, then why do you feel that you owe them anything?

Because i feel for other peoples struggles. I'm just a person who doesn't want to see people dying because of lack of food while others are just throwing food away.

So if a cop or code enforcement is on my property, then I can demand that he leaves? No, clearly not true. The owner always gets access to his property, therefore the government owns the property.

Unless they have a warrant you absolutely can demand that they leave.

 If someone left a trade worse, then they would be unhappy.

So if you get scammed but you left the trade happy its a win-win? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your argument here is that taxes are the price of services rendered. The problem however is that they are services that people don't ask for. So the natural response to not paying taxes is stop the delivery of services.

These services are things such as garbage removal and street cleanings, etc. They are not things that you can just say "no dont do my house".

Imagine for a second that this was to happen in capitalism, where an unpaid bill gave the service provider the right to seize whatever private property they wanted to pay the bill.

Thats often what happens now under capitalism. It may be the govt enforcing it but what you would rather have a situation where someone can default on a loan and have nothing happen?

OK fine. Do you feel any guilt for being born into a system that has kept your family richer than some other people?

Why do you have a fixation on guilt? No i do not. Guilt implies that you could of at one point done something to change the situation.

As long as government can seize anything it wants, that makes everything public property. At best "private" property today is people just renting things from government.

Not at all. You can demand that anyone you do not want on your property leaves your private property. There are far more rules to private property then you are aware of.

 You realize that a bank is powerless without a government court first approving everything? When the men with guns come to drag someone out of their home, it's government employees that hold the guns.

So what your solution would be to give the guns to the company's employees? Can't see any way that can go wrong.....

Right, it's win-win because you are happy when you walk away with a $200 bottle of water.

A win-win trade does not just mean that both parties are happy. It entails both parties coming out for the better which often does not happen in capitalism.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not just land, but any property. The government can seize anything it wants to. I can share videos of government stealing farmers milk for themselves to show that no private property can exist as long as government is allowed to take whatever it wants in the name of the public good.

I already stated that i don't think the govt should be confiscating things but this has nothing to do with govt activities and everything to do with corruption. But what does that have to do with taxes. They are not charging you for simply existing they are charging you for the services that they complete around you.

And yet you don't feel any guilt or responsibility for the system making you richer than them?

The system doesn't make you rich. The system can help keep you rich or help keep you poor but it does not decide for you.

That's because today's system isn't capitalism, so you can't use examples from today's system.

Today's system is absolutely capitalism. What do you think makes it not capitalism?

Foreclosures are carried out by government.

No... foreclosures are often carried out by a bank.

we respect each others property

Right there is where this moves into a fairy tale situation. A win-lose trade can happen anytime but an example would be if one person owns a monopoly on a needed good. Say there is only one lake of fresh water on this island and its on my land. Say the going price was $2 per bottle and one day i decide to change that to $200 per bottle. You would still need the water so you can call that new trade still a win-win but really I'd be taking advantage of you.

<TEXT> Well true capitalism never existed either. So what are we living under right now?

True capitalism has absolutely existed. What we are living under now is capitalism with rules. Rules that have been designed after seeing previous failures of capitalism.

Right, so as long as government can tax and confiscate whatever property they want, then it's not private property. Private property means that it is out of reach of government or anyone else.

Private property has nothing to do with taxes. But i do agree with you that the govt should not be able to confiscate land.

Why were they poor in the first place? Was it the system or their own fault (i.e. lazy)? I would say it was the system.

Yes its the system. The system is designed to keep the poor poor.

As long as a trade is voluntary, then both people walk away happy. If someone wasn't happy, then they wouldn't make the trade.
Only government forces people to act in a trade that they don't want.

Absolutely not true. Plenty of corporations force people into situations that they would not like to be in. And just because someone is happy with a trade does not make it win-win.

Can you give an example where someone walks away with what they don't want?

Foreclosures. That's a prime example of a private entity taking your property to disclose your debt. But either way its not about what people want. You said capitalism is comprised of win-win trades. Win-win trades are not subjective. A win-win means that both people came out better than they were before. A majority of trades in capitalism do not pan out to a win-win. </TEXT>

No i want the poor families to have access to facilities that would allow them to break out of the cycle of being poor.

Definition of capitalism: an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market

There is nothing in there about "win-win trading". Win-win trading is so rare that it could be considered a myth. In almost every trade you will have one loser. In capitalism whenever you expand your wealth you are taking it from someone else.

 Which is socialism, which is what has been happening for the past 100 years almost. The income gap is not a result of capitalism, but rather socialism.

False. True socialism has never existed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're weirdly reading guilt in a place where there is no guilt. I feel no guilt for being in the position I am in. I do know that I have had a good upbringing that has helped me a lot but I have put in a ton of work to be in the position I am in. The reason why I feel like the poor should have access to more is to ensure that their kids have access to everything they would need to bring themselves into a similar situation. You seem to have this idea that if we can not provide them with a similar experience to what people would pay for that we shouldn't even try to give them anything. I see that as just giving up.

We have data and studies that the income/wealth gap is widening each year.

The system (capitalism) is designed to widen the wealth gap. Capitalism with or without a govt overlooking it will eventually end up in a situation like we see today where 1% of the population owns a majority of the wealth. The middle class is unsustainable within capitalism. The most we can do is to subsidize the lower class to give them a better chance of sustaining a middle class.  </TEXT>

No... Govt does not always do the worst possible thing. They might not do the best possible thing but worst is a stretch.

Why do you insist that it must be absolutely free, rather than just a minimal fee? By leaving a small fee, it allows us to eliminate taxation and therefore redistribution of wealth.

Cause a small fee would not allow you to eliminate taxation.

You admitted that they were not all that great compared to the paid museum experience. You seem to want to shove anything in front of a poor person, just so long as you appear to be giving them something.

No they are not great compared to paid museums but you get what you pay for. You have some weird misconceptions about money and valuation. 

You seem to have some obsession about the system rather than the results it brings. life for poor people would be much better without the oppression of government and a free museum doesn't make up for what was taken from them in the first place.

Govt does alot more for our poor population than free museums. There are plenty of organizations meant to provide support for those who are poor. I dont understand why you think life would get better for our poor population without a government...

 So I think you recognize that they have been screwed over by the system, so you have some guilt that you think will be made up for by making museums free.

I do realize that a lot of people have been screwed over by the system but the solution is not to throw out the system. Without the system a lot of people would by much worse off then they are now. At this point you're taking this beyond free museums. You want to just throw out everything and hope that people will live on better. Its an optimistic view but I don't believe its realistic. </TEXT>

Same thing that governments do with criminals today.

What makes you think that these people who have lives that are already stressful with jobs will do any better than a government.

Which means that you're fine with giving poor people low quality stuff. I suppose this is why Flint Michigan has lead in their water.

Not at all the filnt issue should of been solved immediately. But ofc free resources are going to be lesser quality than paid.

Chances are you won't, especially if there are a lot of poor people there. I probably care more for poor people than you do and even I will admit that going to a park filled with poor people is not all that much fun.

Why do you keep trying to make accusations about me? I donate and voulenteer at charities pretty often...

Now compare that to the private museums I went to and they were much more peaceful and enjoyable. I will admit that I felt cheated by the fact that i had to pay, but the experience was a lot less hectic.

Ofc it was less hectic. Lots of people were not able to go because of the cost. I dont get why we cant have both private museums for people who want a less hectic experience and public museums for people who can not afford it. Really the taxes you pay toward museums are minuscule compared to the taxes you pay for schools, military, housing, property etc... Literally these places are supposed to be public spaces for those who can not afford to pay or simply don't want to pay. They are an incredible resource and abolishing them over a tiny tax is just absurd. Public spaces like these are honestly one of the best things our govt uses our tax money for. </TEXT>

Does this neighborhood group pay? What are you going to do with public property? What are you going to do with criminals?

Notice that those are all things that are doing poorly and rich people pay to replace the moment they can afford to.

Ofc cause there will always be better options if you throw enough money at a situation but what about those who cant throw money at the situation?

government still took your money and made you buy a car. Doesn't matter if you say "I didn't support it!", they don't ask for your consent, they just take. By this i mean they gave GM the money and you got nothing in return that you wanted.

Im not arguing with that it was a bad decision.

No... a park or museum is something that i could use at any point that i want. The GM bailout gave me access to nothing. This gives me access to a museum or a park. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   so what the hell do I care who is "most effective" at "running" healthcare? How about no government has the right to control my health?

Ok. I agree. No govt should be able to control your health. But if you get sick and go to the hospital who would stop the hospital from gouging you with prices.

what power? The #1 way that rich people get power is through government. No government = much less opportunity for abuse.

Yes the #1 way the rich get power is through govt BECAUSE govt controls regulations. Without something/someone putting in regulations the companies would be able to do whatever they want.

A doctor or someone who studied healthcare would know alot more about the ins and outs of why our system is not working. Apparently these lawyers can not figure it out.

How about we get rid of the rulers so that those evil rich CEOs have nobody to influence to get power?

Let me guess, you think we need to save the white race before it gets replaced by brown people?

Lol i am brown.

Taxation. I refuse to visit museums, so you make me pay instead for museums through taxation.

Same thing that happens with schools, libraries, city hall, parks, yes.

Same thing happened with the GM auto bailout. I refused to buy crappy GM cars, so the government taxed me buy a car from them.

I did not support the GM auto bailout because that is a private company.

<TEXT> Can you see the irony here? You are afraid of too many companies and too few, both at the same time. Do you think the government knows the right amount of companies to allow to dig up peoples property?

I think that's one of of the main responsibilities of a govt. I'm not saying that our govt currently has this under control but neither extreme is an ideal situation.

If a poor person can't afford to pay for it, then they will survive.Art is not an essential part of life. Can you walk me through what you think might happen if poor people didn't get free museums?

No art is not an essential part of life but it is a part of american culture and i just don't think we should be throwing that away. What will happen is art will eventually become a niche that only the rich can afford to view. 

I think you just want the things that you like and you're willing to enforce this with violence (i.e. government).

<TEXT> So if we eliminate government, we'll have solved that problem.

No we haven't. Who is going to stop companies from just going around tearing up streets laying fiber cables over eachother. You run into a lot more problems in the scenario.

Yes i can compare them. It's my life and you can't tell me what value to place on different things. If i like apples more than oranges, then it's not your place to tell me that I must value them equally.

What I'm saying is that they do not operate in the same way.

I know you are concerned about poor people visiting museums, but why aren't you concerned about them visiting NASCAR or disneyland? What makes looking at the mona lisa more important than going on a roller coaster?

Because the mona lisa is a part of history! Art has cultural impact. Disneyland while being entertaining has no cultural impact. If you could find a way to make a free disneyland id be all for it but it is not a priority because beyond a fun time there is nothing that disneyland can offer you. It is a For Profit business unlike museums which are not for profit and meant to be available to everyone no matter how much money you make.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not permitted by whom? Verizon, Time Warner or someone else?

The city. Laying fiber is a very difficult process so they made a contract with verizon to have verizon lay all fiber for NYC and have not permitted any other company to lay fiber since.

I'm not sure if you own any art, but is it fair that your art is locked away in your home? I want to see it just like you want to see the mona lisa.

That's the point of keeping museums open to make sure that everyone who wants to see it can!

I think you missed my point. People don't want museums, they want disneyland.

You cant compare a private business to a public company.

How about we at least take a vote, rather than you telling me what I should prioritize as important in my life? We agree ahead of time to respect the vote and we decide whether people would rather have free museum tickets or free disneyland tickets. I think you'll lose.

Ofc i would lose that vote! You're comparing a private entertainment company to a public museum. You're completely missing that point!

This whole discussion has turned into how you want me to pay for what you think is important. Sorry i hate museums, but if I have to pay for NASCAR or disneyland tickets, then you need to pay for museum tickets.

NASCAR and Disney are PRIVATE for profit businesses. You can't compare them to a public non profit museum. If Disney tickets were subsidized you'd be funneling money into the owners pockets. When museums are subsidized you're funneling money into keeping a building open. Those are VERY different things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, so would it be fair to say that you're not so much concerned about museums as you are with welfare for the poor? The rich can continue to pay for their museum experience.

No... I'm concerned about the museums staying around. Yes they are mostly populated by poorer Americans / children but there are still plenty of rich people who go. I just want them to be around and the culture of america to be accessible to anyone who wants to view it.

Monopolized how exactly?

I know particularly in NYC no other company is permitted to lay fiber cables. Laying fiber is a very difficult thing to do in a city since you have to rip up streets to get a lot of it underground. All fiber optic services in NYC are run through Verizon's cables. 

Are you concerned about having the Mona Lisa in private hands?

That would never happen but in a theoretical stance yes. I think it should be able to be seen by anyone instead of just locked up in some rich guys house.

Why not the same treatment for Disneyland?

Disney is a private company. They can do whatever they want and charge however much they want. This is about public services staying public not about what you personally value as more memorable. 

America = Disneyland, not an old painting.

This is a huge problem in America right now. We have come to relate our patriotism to companies and now aim to idolize them. This should not be the thought process of our future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Based on what evidence? I haven't visited a free museum in a long, long time. I have however visited several private museums and paid something like $20-$30 per person for tickets.

Mostly that free museums/libraries are often populated with lower income citizens who would not be able to spend $20-$30 on a day to a museum.

 I think you're forgetting that it was government that awarded these cable companies their monopolies.

Not really.... They made a deal with eachother to separate by counties. actually the govt recently stopped them from merging and becoming a true monopoly.

but given enough time there is nothing stopping them from expanding into each others current locations.

Actually Google fiber recently stopped expanding due to the cost of actually running fiber. In addition it will never spread to large cities as Verizon has monopolized Fiber in many areas.

You're calling government to force Time Warner to serve you chicken nuggets.

I'm not calling Govt to force anything. I clearly stated that i think they should stay out of businesses. 

Yes, absolutely. those are what anarchy is primarily focused on eliminating.

That would be chaos. Who do you call if you're getting robbed?

Yes, you're right I do assume that art is sold like cars. I have an art gallery in my local mall. You can walk in and spend a few thousand dollars to get a painting. I always wonder how they manage to stay afloat, since nobody is ever inside buying anything.

Art galleries in malls are very different then actual art galleries. Mall galleries are all for sale. Actual galleries are more for critiques and art enthusiasts.

Then they can charge $30 per person. Why do you insist on it being free?

I insist on it being free because its supposed to be a cultural experience that anyone should be able to see. I don't want a price point on it because i don't want the poor to be excluded from culture just because they are poor. There is no product to be sold here. This is not commerce. This is culture and I don't believe that you should be priced out of culture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, of course. If someone is not willing to pay for something, then they don't really want it. I would like a trip to Japan for free, but I'm not willing to pay for it.

But you're not distinguishing luxury items from public knowledge. You can go without a trip to japan and it wont really effect your life. If you remove things like libraries and museums it will effect many peoples lives.

There are alternatives to cable internet, such as DSL, fiber, wireless and even dialup. What you're really saying is that you want an exact service delivered at an exact price and in an exact way.

Those are not the same product. When you switch to DSL, fiber, wireless your price goes up like 5x. Comcast and TWC have basically monopolized the industry. Without govt regulation whats to stop other companies from doing the same in different industries?

there was a crazy lady one time that called 911 to complain that McDonalds wouldn't serve her chicken nuggets. That is the equivalent of what you're doing here.

How is that what I'm doing? 

I apply this to everything.

So what about military? Police?

If this was 100 years ago, you'd be complaining that henry ford's new automobile would be destroying the buggy whip industry and insist that government should keep the buggy whip industry alive.

Not at all I'm 100% for a free market when it comes to businesses and products. If youre selling something for a profit the Govt should have not input on anything. No business should be kept artificially alive. That's where I make my distinction. Art is not the same. You seem to think that art galleries work in the same way that car shows do or boat shows but its not the same. Art is rarely sold and if it is the galleries make no profit. Galleries are much like libraries where people can go and view the current culture of America. They can go and study what is happening in the world of art. </TEXT>

When you say business you imply for profit.

Absolutely! I can fire a large business, but I can't fire the government.

Go try to fire time warner cable or which ever cable provider monopolized your section of america. You have way more control over who is in your government then who is running the businesses.

 you said that private people fund the large galleries. Now you're saying the majority of people don't want to even pay a dime for them

Yes they are considered an educational resource just like a library.

If these types of culture can't spur anyones interest enough to support them, then they should die off.

Do you apply that for everything or do you just feel like that for "cultral" things? Is there anything you do believe everyone should pay for?

OK, so then offer copyrights to artists and the problem goes away.

How would you copyright art? You cant.... 

Yeah, just 90% is crap. So instead of the large galleries paying for it, taxpayers should. thereby increasing the profits of the large galleries.

Art galleries/museums rarely pull any profit. All donations are spent to keep the lights on and they rarely own any of the art pieces. Its supposed to be a Govt service into culture not a business for profit. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   Lets assume it dies, yet there are a bunch of people dying to pay to watch an NBA game. Well if that's true, then the business owners will find a way to remedy the lack of government schools teaching basketball to children.

So you'd rather have large business trying to interact with your child rather than them just learning through a govt funded program?

Well then the large galleries should charge more and feed that money back to the small galleries.

I think you have a big misunderstanding about how the art world works. Most art museums are free to enter. They are considered a public resource much like a library. Art museums often do not reach out to small galleries as the galleries contently move. They are often not a permanent location and they often rent out space to hold a function.

The difference is that only the people that like art will be paying for art. In the end the people that want art to survive apparently want the non-art lovers to subsidize it for them.

This makes no sense its culture not something to subsidize but something to keep alive.

Music is a form of art. If it works for one, then it works for them all.

Thats not true at all. Music has been cultivated by copyrights to make a profit. They also sell music under these copyrights. Imagine you had to pay to look at an image on google.

All the small gallery art you say we should be supporting is crap. That's why nobody wants to support it. All you're saying that the large galleries shouldn't be the ones paying for the crap, but instead the taxpayers should pay for crap.

Its not all crap! Small galleries are where most of the stuff from large art museums originates!

That's not how business works though. Businesses that produce crap risk only their own money, not taxpayer money.

Not everything is a business!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<TEXT> If it requires government and taxation to keep alive, then by definition it's not profitable. Profitable means that it stands on it's own without assistance.

I'm referring to how profitable the NBA is. College ball is also profitable. But without Elementary school / high school basketball (both not profitable) neither college nor nba would be a thing.

If I'm not willing to spend those dollars, then you're not going to appeal to my sense of emotion regarding it. So yes, the things that I am not willing to spend money on, I couldn't care less on.

This is exactly why we have the govt support it rather then citizens. Most people like large art museums and have no problem supporting them. But they do not realize that their large museums would not survive without small galleries...... so the govt supports the small galleries that keep the large museums alive.

You're separating parts of things when in reality those parts work together.

For example, I hate heavy metal music and i refuse to spend a second listening to it.

Music is a completely different culture than art. Music is 100% profit based. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So prior to government subsidies, how did big galleries find art? We should examine history to see how all the works of arts we see today in museums came about without government subsidies.

Sure if you want to delve into art history be my guest.

besides that, if the NBA can't survive without college basketball, then maybe that means that basketball should die off.

That's the problem with your thinking. You're willing to eliminate something that is extremely profitable and prosperous just because some of the steps below require funding. That's ridiculous.

How about the need for fighting small wars, is it the responsibility for government to fund periodic small wars or else we will get out of the habit of fighting large wars?

You cant compare wars to art or basketball come on.

If people don't step forward to support the small galleries, then the art community deserves to die off.

So you're willing to throw away part of the culture of America just because you don't want to spend a couple dollars? NOTHING in this world has ever started out prosperous. Everything takes investment of some form and if you are not willing to invest in something you will never profit from anything. </TEXT>

Most things that you find in large galleries have been displayed and critiqued in multiple small galleries before gaining enough traction to be showed in a large setting. Small galleries are the infrastructure for the large galleries and the entire culture of art to sit on. Without the small galleries the large galleries would never get any new pieces and would eventually fail. If we stop funding small galleries all were doing is setting up large galleries to fail no matter if they have funding or not. </TEXT>

I've never seen a successful PSA. The most they do is create general awareness. They do not motivate.

You just said though that the citizens support the big galleries. That means that the government funding should be going to the big galleries.

I said the problem is that the citizens only support the big galleries... Govt funding should never discriminate. Govt funding should be allocated based on need.

Are you saying that everyone should be forced to pay $1 equally, even though they don't want to?

Yes unfortunately in this country and really every first world country you as a citizen end up paying into things that you might not have a personal interest in. But this is the basis of taxes. The Govt is a very expensive entity but the securities and essentials it provides are almost priceless. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There is no denying he wanted people to think that some bad would be happening.

I think something bad would happen... Most of the Personal funding for the arts goes to the large Art museums such as the MOMA but smaller galleries rarely get personal funding. A lot of art rises through these galleries and gain attention. No art just shoots to the MOMA unless it's done by an artist who is already famous. Govt support is a big portion of what keeps those smaller galleries alive.

 Are you suggesting that the country is not the sum of it's citizens?

No i am saying the exact opposite. The country is a sum of it's citizens and should support what the citizens support. So if there is support by the citizens into the arts there should also be support by the Govt into the arts. The Govt should act like a large satellite propagating what the citizens of the art community are interested in. That's how culture is formed.

 Would the country be donating $10 to the arts at that point or more somehow?

The country would be donating $10. See but in your scenario you have 100% donations from citizens (much like a tax). Now if you alter your scenario to 2 people giving $5 it would no longer be the country donating. It would be 2 individuals donating.

I cant really talk about your roads argument because i dont know where thats coming from but in reality Govt support of infrastructure is important.

I'm saying that some Govt funds should be put toward the arts rather than relying on citizens to pay directly. There is a big difference between support by citizens and support by the country. Support by citizens is amazing but support by the Govt builds culture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes education is the best approach but it doesn't work for everyone. I personally only run windows defender and occasionally run avg scans and i have yet to get a virus in the past 6+ years. On the other hand... I work in the IT field and if i could explain some of the viruses users get (and how often they get them) you would be dumbfounded.

The issue is that we desperately need a tool that could be semi perfect and handle all the issues that users throw at. McAfee and Norton describe themselves as such but they tend to slow your computer down more than some viruses would. They run constant scans in the background and eat up resources and rarely clear any cached data.

The solution to this would be a program that could theoretically run a constant scan but is smart enough to not need to. In reality 90% of the folders on your pc are rarely touched. Viruses as you stated are mostly downloaded and your downloads are probably something like 1% of the data on your pc. Instead of scanning your whole pc these programs can theoretically scan any opened folders and traveling data then quickly dump cache files after.

Thank You for your reply! It was very informative on the behavior of these products. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm saying there's very little regulation on all of those things and in each case you end up with a monopoly. When there's very little regulation companies can cut corners to lower their price and easily end up with a monopoly on a certain demographic. 

When regulations are introduced yes it makes it harder for smaller companies to enter a market but it also makes it harder for larger companies to corner a market thus more competition. 

Take cars for an example. Market is extremely heavily regulated up to the point on where emissions tests are required every year in some states. While its extremely difficult to enter the car manufacturing market there are plenty of competitors because as long as your product can pass quality tests it can be sold. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But that's rarely the case. Regulations when used correctly are basic standards that a company has to keep up with. Having theses basic standards leads to competition because companies have to see who can offer these standards while providing the cheapest product. Yes its harder for small businesses to thrive but if a small business has a demonstrable competitive edge they will thrive.

When you eliminate regulation you end up with something like the current cable service provider industry. They have almost no regulation and a very elastic demand yet they are able to provide crappy service and stay in business because they are fundamentally corrupt. They've managed to eliminate competition by making deals with each other and buying out every small company that tries to emerge in the market. More often than not, when you eliminate regulation you eliminate competition. </TEXT>

This wall has been estimated at 12-15 billion dollars which is honestly on the low end with hopes that nothing goes wrong. Then after its done you have a yearly upkeep on it. The wall will have a huge impact on our economy.

I'm not sure Trump is so libertarian. Hes libertarian in the terms of less govt involvement and regulation which isn't always a good thing. Without regulation whose to stop companies from gouging the consumer? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Considering the huge amount of resources that have been spent trying to get one big dirty thing on the Clintons for decades... I'm inclined to believe she's likely less corrupt than most people at the level of power in government.

THIS. This is exactly why Trump dropped it once he got into the WH. There was literally nothing to see.

We needed Lisa Simpson, and we got Cartman.. on a bad day.

That's Hilariously true.

IMO both he and Obama should have come out swinging hard for HRC as soon a the primaries were over.

Honestly Obama couldn't of done more cause he was sitting president and Bernie did support her, Bernie's voters just weren't happy about it.

A private server mind you that was set up during Bill Clinton's presidency for him to use as an email server. I'd be willing to bet that half of our govt officials use private email servers for govt business most of which have not been set up by the secret service.

Hillary was an un-likable candidate that's exactly what i was saying. The DNC thought that they could beat and rep candidate with either Hillary or Bernie so they chose the one that would work with them more. OFC Hillary is not around any more. She got embarrassed, she would have no say with any voters anymore; hence, shes no longer useful. Bernie is still around cause he attracts people with what he says, Hillary doesn't know how to do that. </TEXT>

Once primaries were over Bernie had no chance of winning. Too many people right now just vote on party lines for us to elect an independent candidate. He already had attention from the primaries and if he completely joined Hillary's team he could of been put into a position where he could make some change happen.

If you voted for Bernie when it came to national elections (which would have to be a write in since he removed his name from the ballots) you threw your vote away.

<TEXT> Yeah but why? Honestly I am 100% sure that most if not all of these immigrants would come in legally if they were able. The wait to enter this country for people without a lot of money has become ridiculously long. Either we fix this or expect illegal immigrants. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was founded on Immigration! Doesn't matter legal or illegal. The only reason illegal immigration is happening is because our entire immigration system right now is broken and completely money based. Our country was founded off of bringing in the weak and the poor but now we neglect the poor in favor of profits. This is why our country is failing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> SSA reported this income. They are not scamming anyone. If you don't give someone a legitimate way for them to pay how do you expect them to pay? 

Immigrants entering our country is what the country was founded on. I know you expect them to enter legally but our immigration system right now is beyond broken. 

Having low skill labor with anything but low wages just leads to automation. So basically you have to choose between low labor wage or no labor wage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cause it wouldn't need to be nearly as expensive. I don't think the issue was that people didn't think they needed it, everyone gets sick. Everyone will eventually need a doctor for checkups and simple stuff, but people saw how expensive it was and decided that they didn't need it enough to pay that much. With a healthier population health care costs should go down across the board allowing for competition between providers for the lowest sign up cost and therefore the most clients. As the price goes down more people will sign up and the entire system will become more profitable. This granted a high population of healthy individuals vs. Sick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, we would require them to cover high risk individuals just as they are now. There will always be high risk individuals but there will be enough healthy individuals to balance out the pools to make the insurance companies still profitable. The reason why were seeing such an unstable market right now is because when this bill was drawn up they made an estimate of how many high risk indivuals would be signing up. Turns out they drastically underestimated how many high risk individuals there were in the U.S which inevitably made the system much less profitable for insurance companies than predicted.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why do you think they are impossible to quantify? The $12b number was taken straight from the Social Security Administration.  Income taxes are most likely not paid but once again that is our fault not theirs. You absolutely can not assume employers are not paying payroll taxes. The numbers might not be 100% correct but they would get caught so fast not paying payroll taxes.

You would NOT hand out green cards at the border. You would first allow all illegal immigrants currently living in the U.S to apply for a green card. Then you offer an expedited green card system to any people that would like to immigrate into the U.S purely for working purposes. After this you can start to crack down on immigrants who refuse to adapt to this system. It would be incentive for millions to enter through an actual system rather than just coming over. You cant stop people from moving to where they want but you can make a system so that you can actually track who is entering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like i said before in 2013 they paid $12b in local and state taxes. But you're missing the point. You're complaint is that they do not pay taxes, they keep wages low, and they crowd social services. My point is that they do contribute to taxes and the only reason they do not pay more is because it is impossible/very dangerous for their us status to file taxes. Most of the jobs they do take from U.S citizens are very labor intensive low paying jobs, most of which would have already been automated was it not for the low wage option. And ofcourse they crowd social services. Name one low wage community that doesn't. But honestly the U.S is missing out on a real opportunity. Imagine we allow these people to stay here and give them green cards. Now you have an entire new community to tax (Maybe we can reduce some of that $600b deficit) along with a work force for the low wage labor intensive jobs and honestly less strain on social services since they will now have access to insurance, and immigrants are less likely to visit a doctor than nation born citizens anyway. It honestly sounds like a win-win. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is illegal immigrants do pay taxes! All illegal immigrants pay sales tax, and in 2013 about 50% of illegal immigrants paid sales taxes, excise taxes, property taxes and personal income taxes. Accounting for $12b in State and Local taxes! I'm sure if wern't afraid of deportation some would of even filed federal taxes. It is not their fault they are not paying taxes, it is ours. They are absolutely necessary for some American businesses. No intelligent business man would hire illegals if they could afford to hire Americans like really the risks alone not even considering the increase in quality of work is enough to veer you away if there are other choices.  </TEXT>

In 2013 illegal immigrants ended up paying $12b in local   state taxes.(Effectively 8% of their income) They do inevitably crowd social services but imagine our tax revenue increase if 100% these people were granted citizenship and were paying full taxes.

<TEXT> I don't get how Trump can run a campaign about cutting costs and excess spending then try to pump more money into the military. It literally doesn't make sense. This article states how the U.S is in marvels of Russia's and China's new military strength. Yet if you take both of their military budgets, combine them and double it you still don't reach the U.S. spending. We need to cut this budget at very least down to 500b and junk all these old weapons were trying to use. We constantly stock pile as if were going to war tomorrow and not only is it costing us billions its also eliminating the economical bump we used to see from war (which republicans historically count on). Our military is over inflated and pumping more money into it will solve absolutely nothing. The U.S that Trump is always talking about that was so great, relied heavily on Science and Immigration (illegal or not). Trying to make the U.S great without those two is like trying to eat soup with a knife. </TEXT>
