<TITLE> The Evil Within (2017) The spiritual successor to "The Room" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 10:17:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I finished watching this and have no idea what its about or gone on, this is as if The Room crossed Forrest Gump as a horror movie. Dialogue is hilarious "You think i'm a stupid mongoloid?", tons of exposition, dream sequences that cut to a different random guy and his own story... all with those sweet practical effects.

Andrew Getty the person who made this passed away before this movie was completed and had a decade of post production spent on "perfecting it". One thing this has in common with "The Room" is the dedication and belief exhausted into both projects. 

https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/14/the-evil-within-horror-movie-andrew-getty-millionaire-meth

To turn out as hilarious as it has is a testament to the little guys that want their project to materialize without intentionally making trash like Sharknado or 50 Shades of Black etc.

This is more competently made than the room though. Highly recommend watching this fucked up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I need help getting Siegward Of Caterina to appear in the well at cleansing chapel?

Here's a rundown of what iv'e done.

- Against the fire demon from earlier in the game he helped me and did not die in the battle.

- At cleansing chapel iv'e opened both locked door to the left and right of the bonfire, iv'e also killed both giants and raised both bridges.

- Now I have no idea how to get up those bridges and i'm up to the part where I catch that lift to the rooftops and head to rosaria's fingers. Apparently if I make it there I will block Unbreakable Patches from showing up hence ruining Siegwald's quest? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's because it's on primetime and they also have encore episodes which all get factored in the ratings. Part of the reason "Big Bang Theory" is the most watched comedy ever, is it's usually on at 7pm and three back to back episodes take it to 8:30pm.

It's messed up that we got breaking bad, walking dead and eastbound   down on free to air at one point but they got the graveyeard shift with no episode continuity. Sometimes it's on at 11:30pm on Mondays, then the next Monday it's suddenly not and got moved to wednesdays. </TEXT>

<TITLE> (AUS QLD) My father and his "buddy" made a bet together, but the "buddy" gave him a minuscule amount of the winnings. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-03 11:17:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just wanted to check and see if my dad can get some money out of this if we got a lawyer or if it's a lesson learned don't repeat scenario.


My dad is a regular at the TAB, goes about 2-3 times a week with about $100 each time more as a hobby than addiction. He's older and the friendly chatty type. He usually stays for 4hrs betting $3-8 per bet. To explain his "buddy" in context, he's not really a friend but more of an acquaintance you see every now and again. Try and imagine a guy at your gym that you chat with at the gym and get along well with, but don't hang out or talk or anything outside of the gym.


So this buddy is older and loaded, made a fortune investing in property and is enjoying his retirement in contrast to my dad who does not own anything of value and drives a shitbox (but he's still  employed for his age). He goes to the TAB about 3-5 days a week with 8k or so and does the same as my dad but with larger bets etc. $70 trifecta compared to my dad who would do a $4 trifecta.


They get to know each other a bit and sit next to each other talking about their personal life, horses etc. and this buddy begins to trust my dad.


So here we go.

My dad makes his own bets with his own money as does his buddy, and for about the last 6 months his buddy would give my dad $50 every now and again and say something like "bet it all in one go, whatever happens we split it" this guy is absolutely loaded remember, his mid 30's son is basically on an allowance living it up.


Usually not much happens, my dad always returns the ticket to him after writing it then putting it into the teller. And on this one occasion a ticket paid out close to 8k. My dad having previously bet in a race for himself decided he'll just do the same bet again with his buddies money but for a larger dividend etc. Dads ticket cost $8 for 44% of the winnings, while the other dudes ticket cost $50 for about 300%. My dad physically goes up to the teller to put his buddies ticket in and also picked the winning numbers. (The employee at this place knows my dad is not a big gambler if it helps). My dad could win $5k and will still only bet up to $8 in any race.


So same thing as normal when he gave my dad the $50 "whatever happens we split". We had a birthday party to attend that afternoon and my dad left the TAB earlier than normal and missed the entire bet which his buddy collects the winnings from solo. He got me to check his $8 ticket which was a winner and was ecstatic to realize he gets half of his buddies ticket too.


So after a couple days they bump back into each other at the TAB and his buddy says "we only had it for about 90%, I got around 2k and lost it all. Iv'e got $700 on me right now here you can have $200" which he accepted in spite. (The claim he got 2k is a lie, my dad knows! he wrote the ticket! as his $8 ticket was an exact copy but for less winnings) the buddy did not know that my dad also won on the same race so I guess he's trying to misinform him.


It absolutely pisses me off that this rich guy would F my dad over like this, 4k would help our family out alot but is just spare change to this guy. I want to check with you guys if there's anything we can do? </TEXT>

"That's my favorite movie! i'll put that on" :/

It does seem the theory that the majority of people just want to see what they already are familiar with is true.

Also all I want in a summer blockbuster could be something like The Mummy with Brendan Fraser but about Atlantis and it's never going to happen because studious are heavily investing in proven franchises and superhero properties. </TEXT>

So out of these three what is best value or very special and a must try scotch in AUD dollars.

3) A plot where they are grounded, not take down the Colombian druglord and hardest heist in the world nonsense.

4) It was about babes and importantly cars.

5) Stunts, cinematography and soundtrack were A+.


Only nitpick was the supporting actress not being a very good actor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I recall correctly in one of those seven losses they were up against the cowboys and got out to a 18-0 lead within 25mins... but proceeded to concede a shitload of points and not score themselves again. Hurrr Durrr it's Johnson's fault, something something he's not steering the team around derp. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair was what they were doing before working in the first place?

I thought attack was good, Dragons just nailed every 1on1 tackle and warriors were never able to build pressure through their kicking game either.

But hell that try where dugan ran through mannering and lillyman was not the coaches fault. I even saw the player outside lillyman shove him to cover the gap as if anticipating it but he budged an inch and stood like a statue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was thinking how as tech advances and we get stuff like siri but actually useful, hearing Tommy's voice would be heartmelting.

Imagine getting into your self driving car and hearing Tommy say "Oh hai (users name) where does my best friend want to go today?" and as your driving along a random "Anyway, hows your sex life?" drops or "You look so sexy today".

Also saw Francos movie 'Why Him' and he has an AI home assistant with Kaley Cuoco's voice... I realize it's fictional but that's the idea!

I hope he might be up for something like this if he get's a good paid offer to read the words and lines. </TEXT>

B) Change to golden point for regular season (If scores are tied at 80min, each side gets a point... if there is a winner of 10mins extra time they get an additional point)


C) A 6 man bench (Seriously necessary cause of the new concussion rules)


D) A overhaul of player eligibility rules for SOO and Test footy. And revised international games/schedule so there's some prestige about it and granting funds to smaller nations so they can get the likes of Milford etc. I currently do not give two F's for test footy since every year it's OZ's comp to lose.


E) A virtual grid for the bunker to check offsides. 


F) A short 2 round NYC draft (Though will require alot of work and overhaul of the current system, no point in the warriors developing a talent another side can nab)

<TEXT> If anything it would be a joke if the NYC stays the way it is and we start pumping money into a womens game. 

In tennis they fought and eventually got equal pay (even though mens grand slams can go for 5hrs, to about 2hrs for womens). If Serena Williams played the best 15yo boy in the world and lost, I wonder if they would have kicked up a fuss in the beginning? 

But yea I'd rather money goes into growing our game overseas and a higher quality comp for the NYC before (gurl power, we can too... its 2017) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't see why some out of the lot can't pick up the learning curve, there could be some good props and wingers over there...

I honestly think that if the NRL was serious about pushing the game over there they need to send some ex players and training/coaching staff over for a tour of about 5-6 of the more prominent college football schools.

There they register interest from guys playing for their college and go through drills and fitness levels and pick out some standouts. At that point they can go "If you don't enter the draft or get drafted at all, your invited to come down to australia and attend a league camp". At that point they would get some hopefuls that will go through rugby league training and potentially go play reserve grade.

If there is financial backing from US something like this can be done once every 2-3 years, down the track they can pool a US team together in reserve grade.... and just maybe the US could take an interest in supporting the side further. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm totally for this, and they should scrap the trial games.

This is a big wishlist and probably never going to happen, but I wish the NRL would take over develoment of grassroots footy/NYC so we can get a draft in the NRL. Would work the same as NFL/NBL but only go for 2-3 rounds and whoever wins the nines can also get an extra automatic 1st overall pick with priority over the team that finishes 16th on the ladder. If you finish 16th, but win the nines you can effectively pick out the x2 best players in the NYC straight away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just finished painting a nerf element, 3 coats of flat black vinyl dye then dry brushed gold, silver and gunmetal.

I've reached topcoating time and have a duplicolor clear topcoat i'm going to use. My question is:

How heavy do I go with the top coat?

The can says: Apply several light coats , allow paint to become touch dry between coats. 

Since this is automotive spray for a plastic toy, seven is overkill right?

Also I lightly applied about 3 coats of black vinyl dye inside the shell to the dart holder, is it a bad idea to topcoat inside there? it's not sanded but was washed with warm soapy water beforehand.

He pretty much made the same movie even set in japan again, but with the bigger budget looked more polished.

I'd imagine that if the original wailing director got the nod again, he'll set it in South Korea but just make the protagonist a white guy from america or something. </TEXT>

I guess some kids got them without doing a range test and were satisfied it hit a little harder. Now what mods do you get for $70 you say?

The only way to make meters is spam the pass buttons to the right then back to the left willy nilly.

The incredible logic in building a team where you can literally have x17 wingers with 99 speed/acc/stamina and pwn properly built teams.

The god awful AI who will run right next to you in support and just as you've drawn in the last cover guy and press the pass button, the dickhead in support stops and your pass goes over the sideline.

Still no fantasy draft options when starting a frachise mode career!

<TEXT> Blair witch honestly was not that bad, but not good either.

I'm not too high on the original blair witch, which benefited from the pre widespread internet status of today, otherwise their blair witch was a solid sequel... 

Goodbadflicks did a video on the book of shadows, and I reckon even if done properly people mostly wanted to see a re-tread of the original. Which this one was but was more eventful. 

However as a horror/found footage movie on it's own it's rather forgettable,and yes hopefully they work on their own projects for future movies.

Just wanted to get my opinion out there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sequels must be considered canon and watched to get the entire story... then i realized some franchises will never be left to rest in peace despite the what the ending concludes with.


For example:


I only recognize 2 blade movies, trinity never happened!

I only recognize the first 2 terminator movies.

I only recognize alien and aliens, the shitty sequels don't exist!

<TEXT> what i think big budget video game movies suffer from.

The checklist of tentpoleness handed down to whoever the director is.

- Must be PG13 so the kiddies can pay to watch it.

- Dumb it down so kids in the Philippines can follow along.

- Add forced humor, shoehorn a love interest.

- No practical effects, CGI all the way.

- We need to be able to sell toys, no scary character designs... if needeed make mongoloids like doomsday.

and pretty much whatever is birthed from such a checklist will turn out garbage... best hope would be a indie filmmaker who's a fan of the source with a 10-20mil budget and having creative control  </TEXT>

It's so weird that it doesn't go well with much and is quite overpowering... not saying it's bad. I tried a mojito with 60ml and it overpowered the bitters/mint/lime. Only delightful drink ive made with it is lemonade, lemon lime bitters cordial syrup, gin, pernod, parfait amour.

<TEXT> i'll never forget in a game at half time, the stats came up while one team was up 10-0... the stats were quite balanced apart from 1 linebreak and 3-4 missed tackles.

she says "well looking at the stats ___ have been dominating" and i'm at home going WTF while darren locker actually corrected her and said "no, you'll find its quite even just ___ has taken advantage of their opportunities".

Also pre grand final the team were talking about the sharks new recruits and the influence they've made, she comes in with "james maloney what a story he's been, to think he was unwanted at the roosters last year" and again got corrected that the sharks chased him hard.

I often find she regurgitates what the panel says, without actually adding to what they say or at least come up with her own analysis..

I hope allana ferguson or sammy bremner get a gig. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i take records from pre NRL with a grain of salt, it's easy to win 91-6 when everyone from back in the day didn't have competition to steal their spot in the team and sides were thrown together at signups in the pub.

Because this is a reply to you, i'm not trying to be a dick or lecture everyone or anything don't take this as a shot at you. I'd wish though we could drop the records and stats from pre NRL, today even if your team is shit your 'usually' trying your best because contracts are huge and if your not having a go someone else will gladly take your spot and these NRL guys are never spotted again.

I doubt league was as cutthroat back in the day and losing sides didn't give a F if they let teams walk tries in when it was already over.

I think the sharks flogging of the knights and the big streak was largely glossed over TBH as "eh they couldn't beat the old record of 3 seasons undefeated by the eastern derp-dadurks, no big whoop" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our league guys all have good hands which means their best shot is on offense, the defense part of the NFL requires a ton of instinct that you cant teach in 2 years.

Lolo - TE as a pass catcher/blocker
       - FB  as mostly a blocker, power back on short yardage situations

Holmes - A returner only, if he makes it and commits long term he can eventually be a 3rd/4th WR...

Taumalolo has the best hope I reckon </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with most of what you said except for the entirety of giving union shit, it's a traditional yet boring rugby code but it's international scene takes a dump on league.

This is a big issue for me as I WANT to like test footy but ultimately don't give a F cause it's predictable. Also there's no investment with test footy. Cause I support the broncos seeing them get into the finals after a 26 week marathon yet the sprint is about to begin is thrilling.... that finals pressure is a whole different beast. Four nations however my team AUS will go into the tournament at WINX odds and either do as expected after four games or be disappointing and lose in the final. 

They should overhaul eligibility rules, give funding to the smaller nations so they attract the milford type players and re-structure the tournament events.

Until things change i'm happy just watching club footy, and origin when it rolls around.

<TEXT> my take on the odds are:

- Broncos   Storm still genuine premiership contenders

- Raiders should have little origin rep players and beat up on teams at the midpoint of the season. Got them 3rd favourites.

- Cowboys   Sharks set to drop off while other teams will be improving...either one or both could fill 6-8th on ladder, not suprised if either just miss the 8. Sharks losing Ennis will hurt way more than Barba. He led the team for try assists in their 2015 season. Cowboys lose Tamou, still have a gun team but I feel they were the first genuine back to back premiers we've had in a while and it's no coincidence they dropped off part to Granville who was soo influential in 2015 having had a poor 2016 season... he and Cowboys could bounce back however.

- Panthers top 8 near certainties, but at that price you pretty much can only add the $1.40 to multi's you don't mind a later payout on. I do not consider them premiership contenders however due to the youth on stock especially at 6 7 whether its Cleary/Martin or Carty, they'll be able to muster wins during the season but finals pressure is a whole different beast for a young halves combination. Future is exciting though, they'll be contending from 2018 unless some kind of scandal or mass players exodus happen.

- Roosters, Warriors, Titans, Rabbitohs, Bulldogs top 8 hopes with Warriors, Titans and Rabbitohs most likely of the five to emerge as dark horses. I'm really keen on the warriors chances this year and at their price i'm going all in with Top 4, Top 8, Reach GF and win GF going in ALOT of multis. I totally feel they've gotten their shit together with the right coach, right players signed from other clubs, right players have been retained and Shaun Johnson coming of a career year in 2016.

- Eels, Dragons, Tigers, Knights are the no hopes. Can not even consider any fluke bets on them to pull out a 2016 Titans revival. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work at a BWS in brisbane aus and we have a pandora playlist running in the store, at night the tracks turn towards edm/house/chill... theres one song i'm after and when I finally decided to find out what it was they changed the playlist!

Google and running through tracks on youtube with you take me away has been no help.

This song would have to be recent from at least 2013 onward, house/tranceish with female vocals.

The only lyrics I can recall are "you take me away" from a soft female voice and the songs gets to a loop with this kind of beat in a rapid loop.

'ah.duh.duh.duh.duh.duh.ah.duh.duh.duh.duh.duh' and that goes on for quite a bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They lockdown the ruck and always get three guys involved to smother the ball carrier in a tackle and will slow that shit right down. If you don't have good offloaders your pretty much going to be limited to possession in your own half.

Kick pressure from cam smith compounds this with munster/slater able to get to everything on the full and return it to the 30m line. They don't miss many tackles either.

With their goal line defence they mark up better than other teams, your best scoring opportunities usually will rely on the 1 on 1 situation and beating the storm guy. etc. hard to get an overlap against them of one of those shitty second man plays but when/if the ball gets to the fullback/centre/winger they need to beat their man rather than stroll into a gap.

Also they hand brown paper bags of cash to the referees as insurance to make sure the penalty count is in their favour.

But the warriors have been making the right moves with bringing up young players,retaining current and signing from other sides without sending out a new look team year in/out.

<TEXT> lachlan maranta:

1) He was really slow, in the nines dale copley from an overlap gets him good ball and they create a break. Maranta gets dragged down from behind 15m downfield... wtf. This happened twice in the same nines game. 

2) Poor workrate/forwards have to do it tougher/his hitups were weak as fk and can't get the set on a roll from a kick return.

3) Can't break tackles, suffers from run 8m foward and get tackled back 5m syndrome. 

4) Not even a good finisher, hodges would throw him a sweet pass where maranta is on the outside of the winger with a wide open tryline and he can't back himself so he cuts back in.

5)I believe he only really played because of nepotism.

I'm not trying to completely crush the poor guy, but he was always a reserve grade player. Vidot got flack for being shaky under a high ball but he did all those other things excellently. But no-one bats an eye when Maranta dropped a few bombs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm ape shit over club footy and don't really care about origin, but origin is one hell of a spectacle and am totally in awe of the constant high quality it delivers. I WANT to love test footy but it's a boring mess. Test footy needs a complete overhaul of eligibility and tournament structures. Better we ignore it so they realize changes must be made. 

There's no underdogs to root for, when Fiji, Samoa, Tonga unearth some beasts AU   NZ will groom them like a internet pedophile. When Cronk   JT retire you'd expect Milford will be the next in line however I'm annoyed that:  

a) He has no incentive to play for Samoa, money talks and AU will get their man.

b) The standard of rosters nowdays is exceptional with tons of talent spread across the comp and AU can easily pick a great five eight who will do a great job but will instead step on Samoa's balls by picking Milford. (Same for the likes of Semi)

Also I feel there's no prestige in test footy, AU are always good every now and again NZ compete. While England might one day join them it's always a AU   NZ circle jerk whether its a tri nations or world cup victory. Winning a grand final is a 26 week marathon with a 4 week sprint where the winners are gladiators of the competition. A tri nations victory is pretty much, beat up on England play NZ in the final and sometimes win as if it's one mighty achievement anyone should care about. 

Test footy should be ignored until we get a better standard. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-10-03 19:18:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Was thinking about how hard it is to make a case for anyone in this years eight to miss out... but it will happen due to the impossibility of getting the same eight two years in a row.

Titans likely drop out but they have a good roster, I don't like the dogs cause of Lichaa who's a big problem for their attack but man Hasler is just always in the finals isn't he.

I'm liking the Rabbitohs, Roosters and Warriors to push their way in... Before everyone comments how the warriors will lock up 9th, they're due for finals footy and Kearny has sprinkled some magic on the test team who have been outstanding. Rabbitohs spine is one of the best in the comp, but Gurgess needs to bounce back into form since they lost Nathan Brown. Roosters were crippled at the start of the year without Pearce, Cordner and JWH also Latrell's inexperience at a key position let them down, he'll need this season on the wing for his development while Gordon provides immediate reliability.

In my eyes only the Eels, Tigers, Dragons   Knights don't have a case. When you dissect the Eels roster they are in real trouble, Robson and Degois are G.O.A.T players though so who knows. Tigers might be one of the two youngest rosters next year, no way they'll be consistent. Dragons roster got worse, no evidence to show they can turn it around. Knights self explanatory. 

Who do you guys reckon will make it? </TEXT>

Threw 10 on ennis for clive churchill and a multi Panthers, Cutters, Sharks. I reckon fifita   gals offloads will set the tone of the match, can the storm wrestle the offloads away? 

This will go one of two ways, storm win 1-12 or sharks 13+ depending on how well the storms defence can smother. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ray warren is gonna fire these stats of tomorrow like a semi auto as if they will factor into the result. 

Also regarding stats, they need to separate records from pre/post NRL so we can better recognize achievements. Like the biggest ever winning margin was in a time where players got signed up at the pub and smoked durries during the warm up in 1935.

The sharks 15 game streak was Huuuuuuge in the state of the NRL right now you need to have an elite roster, little/no injuries, good calls from the refs and luck to pull something like it off yet after the draw with the titans nobody but their supporters gave a shit about them after cause they couldn't surpass the (this is a off the top of my head made up fact) eastern suburbs 1968 streak of 22.

Cause of the incredible production of wingers, most young kids that come through do an equal job to the mature players attacking wise but face a learning curve defensively.

<TEXT> for those who missed it, these were the dodgy calls titans were fed with... my flair is broncos but I fkn had $50 on titans with sportsbet... titans didn't help their cause with errors coming out of their half though.

1) Roberts kick: Personally i don't think much of it but as sterlo said if they go back to it titans get a penalty and march down the field instead of the broncos try 2 plays after.

2) Corey oates kamikaze penalty: In the first half Hayne made a break and bronc player swats it down with ref ruling a titans scrum... Bunker overturns it which was RIGHT but the fact they didn't for the oates penalty is a joke. Broncos march down the field and score from that penalty.

3) God forward pass: 5mins to go hayne throws a cutout ball to hurrell who offloads to his winger 40m away for a linebreak when they stop it there. It was fair game, though broncos were in cover and could have shut it down we don't quite know for sure. Don't hold me to it but I believe broncos score the set after.

And anyone saying "yea but they conceded 44pts, if you do that you deserve to lose" don't quite understand how being under pressure works. When you shouldn't even be under it to begin with, you won't concede points in the first place!

<TEXT> Good on him, though let's still look at this guy going forward.

The wing is the most productive position in the NRL, year in and out we get freaks debut and sometimes develop their skills to move into fullback/center/second row and become versatile. Those guys that stay stuck on the wing have to compete against those 20yo prodigies year after year.

Then you arrive at a crossroads go down the Jason Nightingale path where your high workrate, finishing and versatility sees a productive career... or the Nathan Merritt path where while young will call upon freakish try scoring instincts but then as you move into your late 20's speed will drop off and season try tallies of single digits.

He will be a liability on the defensive side of the ball on the wing, if we are gonna see the best of french hopefully he's got some amazing ball-playing ability to move to fullback. He does not have the high hit-up workrate to sustain a career on the wing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> this won't solve squat... it neeeeds to be used in 50/50 situations like when a tard drops the ball and the ref gives a penalty, play has stopped and the captain has about a 10sec window before they tap it or kick to touch to go to the ref and challenge.

Also in golden point when we hit fieldgoalathon everyone is offside, if you get charged down by someone who jumped the gun i'd be spewing for a penalty or a challenge on it.

With regards to tries only we are still gonna get the bunkers messed up interpretations of what appears to have happened.

Sooo many times in the past you would see out of favor players gun for that 3+ year commitment and when they get signed produce flaming hot garbage.

Warriors need to work him into their cap next year... also they need to keep tui and move him into centres, it will be extremely important to their depth when they pick up an injury to RTS or the halves and have him slot right in for the duration of the injury. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a game last year where she was on the panel with locky   johns at half-time. Score was 16-4 or something and they brought up the stats like line-breaks,missed tackles and whatever.

The incarnation of supreme rugby league knowledge sampson says in regards to the team leading "Well when you look at the stats they are completely lopsided and the ____ are in total control".

At the time i'm thinking WTF cause the stats were quite similar, about 3 missed tackles difference, 1 line break, possession had about a 2% swing and Darren lockyer says on air "umm no, you'll find that it's been pretty close and the second half is up in the air".

She don't know shit but is on the panel, and often will regurgitate whatever johns says when she closes of a discussion.

Man I hope she gets sacked from footy. </TEXT>
