<TEXT> That's pathetic. See below for the real story. So many of you are looking so desperately for a hero that you overlook the truth. The crew used this girl and ordered her to stay behind, with others. And ypu applaud that she dies while they survived. Are you a Christian, perhaps? 

This is not an isolated event. Some are asked to sacrifice their lives while others survive at their expense. Teach your kids to fight for their lives,  not to obey orders while someone walks all over them.

<TEXT> This is what happens when you teach your children slave mentality. You risk losing them. It's not heroism. I'd rather teach my daughter to survive than to be a sucker helping others get ahead at the cost of her life.

Also, forcing a child to go out into the world before she's ready is not an inherently good thing. Listen to your kids. If they'd rather stay home there might be a good reason for it. When they're ready they'll go and how. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tell you what the problem is. Guys who use only online dating have no balls because they become accustomed to the virtual process of hitting on a woman, as you'd do in a video game.

Women who are worth a dime know this. So we'll go to a bar and meet someone with the balls to talk to a real live woman. We don't care if it requires beer or drunkenness--at least you can smell his fucking breath and use non virtual chemistry to take in his pheromones ;)

Be a man. If you want a woman, get offline.

<TEXT> I'm very grateful for your reply. I'm going to try again tonight and ensure that I am following through. I was also unaware that you have to lead blaster bolts to the ship.

I find the upgrades difficult to understand. The descriptions presuppose prior knowledge, unlike my own ship's upgrades. 

I applied 3 or 4 upgrades and then gave up when I noticed I was still doing no damage. It's bizarre because I do space missions way above my own level.

Anyway, I'll give it another go but with the time commitment required to learn what all the armor and weapons do, I'd have to stop playing my non-GSF game.

I really do appreciate your awesome reply.

<TEXT> Apologies, internet guy. I should have cited the academic journal I got this from but I thought I was posting on reddit.

His approval ratings were based on 1. Over a decade of perseverance and 2. Hatred for the previous administration/bad economy. And yes, his propaganda was censored. So lots of people had no clue what he was capable of. 

Censorship is always wrong. And if you defend free speech you have to defend it for the views you hate most.

<TEXT> This is disappointing. I always looked up to Australia as one of the few nations to stand up for both the environment, health and animal rights -- its recent actions against Japan, for instance, with regard to to whale hunting . Australia has made gutsy moves that other countries do not dare to make, like the banning of certain GMO products, which pisses off several large corporations. 

I'm prepared to criticize the government for this latest reluctance to move forward on environmental issues, but the pieces don't seem to fit. </TEXT>
