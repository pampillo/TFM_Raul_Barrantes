<TEXT> A new European concept called the Small Mars System (SMS), described in a paper in the journal Ars Astronautica, would use a helicopter drone, among other items, to explore the surface. The European Space Agency funded a feasibility study of the project that concluded in May 2016. The team  led by the Aerospace Laboratory for Innovative Components is hoping to move into Phase A work soon, but that will require more grants to fund specific parts of the system. </TEXT>

The company originally confirmed to The Verge back in March that unlocked versions would be arriving in May, and now Samsung will let you put money down with an availability date of May 31st. As we noted when the Best Buy listings first went live earlier this year, this timeframe is about one month earlier than past unlocked Galaxy devices have been made available in the US. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The real cost of the bailouts is that they demonstrated the willingness of the government to save large financial institutions that get themselves in trouble. In doing so, they give banks an incentive to be even more reckless in the future.

Both JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs worked with hedge funds to bet against the toxic mortgages after the crash had started. They made money by selling short on the financial catastrophe they had created. We should have let them crash and hope the new ones learn from their mistakes.

<TEXT> In the game, the player's character joins one of three world-controlling secret societies attempting to repel, mitigate or exploit the attack of Lovecraftian entities and other immortal beings in coastal Maine, rural Egypt, Transylvania and a quarantined section of Tokyo, and advance their society's agenda over that of the others.

The game uses a contemporary setting, borrowing heavily from the horror fiction genre and folklore, with a fog-ringed, zombie-infested New England fishing village for the novice player, mummies and cultists in Egypt for the mid-level player, followed by vampires and werewolves in Transylvania and ghosts, robots, Oni demons and an interdimensional occult cancer in Tokyo. Mission content bleeds into player faction headquarters in London, Seoul and the DUMBO neighborhood in Brooklyn, and into the game's transport network, along the subterranean branches of Yggdrasil in Agartha.

Unlike many other MMORPGs, there is no need to stop to use most of a character's attacks and abilities; as a result, combat is faster and movement-based. The character is free (and at higher levels, occasionally obliged) to redevelop their abilities on the go, to better prepare themselves for specific threats or better integrate into a group. Unlike traditional MMORPGs, advancement is primarily through equipment, using experience points to buy additional abilities and more powerful weapons. </TEXT>

"The K5 has a maximum speed of 18 miles per hour (29 kph), but usually it moves at 1 to 3 miles per hour. It is designed to use mapping software to create a geo-fenced perimeter that makes it stay within one area. The K5 creates a point cloud to show a 3-D image of the surroundings in the geo-fenced area. The K5 also uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects in surroundings and movements of its wheels. The K5 detects criminal records through facial recognition. It scans up to 1,500 license plates per minute. When the K5 detects a license for a known criminal on "hot list", it will alert the law enforcement force. It can also check its database to confirm the match. It has "360-degree high definition video capture" The K5 uses the infrared light to collect about 90TB of data every day, and the infrared light can function at night. The thermal imaging sensor detects and measures minute temperature differences. Also, it can cooperate with the microphone to check whether there is a bright glare after a loud sound possibly from an explosion or gunshot. It can detect objects 24 hours a day. " </TEXT>

<TEXT> The authors's conclusion is stark: "Artificially sweetened soft drink consumption was associated with a higher risk of stroke and dementia." But that seems to be overselling the results for dementia. For stroke, there do seem to be more consistent associations that are worth following up on.

But, as the authors spend extensive time in the paper discussing, there's no way of telling why this association exists at this point. "Sicker individuals [may] consume diet beverages as a means of negating a further deterioration in health," they posit. "Indeed, in our study, diabetes mellitusa known risk factor for dementiawas more prevalent in those who regularly consumed artificially sweetened soft drinks."

In other words, don't clear out your fridge just yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mirai, the botnet that threatened the Internet as we knew it last year with record-setting denial-of-service attacks, is facing an existential threat of its own: A competing botnet known as Hajime has infected at least 10,000 home routers, network-connected cameras, and other so-called Internet of Things devices.

FURTHER READING
Why the silencing of KrebsOnSecurity opens a troubling chapter for the Net
Hajime uses a decentralized peer-to-peer network to issue commands and updates to infected devices. This design makes it more resistant to takedowns by ISPs and Internet backbone providers. Hajime uses the same list of user name and password combinations Mirai uses, with the addition of two more. It also takes steps to conceal its running processes and files, a feature that makes detecting infected systems more difficult. Most interesting of all: Hajime appears to be the brainchild of a grayhat hacker, as evidenced by a cryptographically signed message it displays every 10 minutes or so on terminals. The message reads: </TEXT>

Passengers would have their photos taken immediately before boarding, to be matched with the passport-style photos provided with the visa application. If theres no match in the system, it could be evidence that the visitor entered the country illegally. The system is currently being tested on a single flight from Atlanta to Tokyo, but after being expedited by the Trump administration, its expected to expand to more airports this summer, eventually rolling out to every international flight and border crossing in the US. </TEXT>

The system is currently being tested on a single flight from Atlanta to Tokyo, but after being expedited by the Trump administration, its expected to expand to more airports this summer, eventually rolling out to every international flight and border crossing in the US. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Enter a new study device developed by MITs Hyunho Kim. His idea is to work with a unique class of materials called metal-organic frameworks. Organic, carbon-based molecules form links between metallic ions to create interesting 3D structures that can have lots of open space internally. This allows the structures to do strange things, like make a high-pressure tank hold far more hydrogen gas after its first filled with granules of the right metal-organic framework material.

Kim worked with a zirconium oxide paired with an organic molecule. The combination has the useful quality of grabbing and holding onto water vapor at lower temperatures, but also letting go of that water as the heat rises. So the basic idea is that a device based on this material could passively harvest water vapor from the air at night and then release it (to be collected) in the heat of the day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The GPS-guided MOAB weighs 21,700 pounds and is filled with 18,700 pounds of H6 explosive. The thirty foot long aluminum casing weighs only 3,000 pounds, which is an unusually low proportion of the bomb's overall weight. Unlike many bombs, for which steel shrapnel is a primary effect, the MOAB is designed to generate explosive shockwaves and is stuffed as full of as much explosive as possible. A bomb that kills through overpressure, the MOAB is well suited for destroying cave complexes. Waves of pressure entering a cave system cause injuries and fatalities, and the shock can collapse earthen tunnels.

<TEXT> Alert sirens, especially older ones like those used in Dallas, are usually controlled by tone combinations used by the Emergency Alert System broadcast over the National Weather Service's weather radio. Alternatively, they can also be controlled by Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) or Audio Frequency Shift Keying (AFSK) encoded commands from a dispatcher or command center terminal sent over UHF radio frequencies that were set aside for emergency agencies' use by the FCC in 2004 (these are typically in the 700 MHz range).

If the frequency used by the sirens in Dallas for DTMF or AFSK wasn't monitored, an attacker could conceivably broadcast an endless number of guesses at DTMF or AFSK encoded commands until the sirens were set offand then just play that command signal repeatedly. But it's possible that someone managed to gain access to documentation for the siren system and knew exactly which commands to send. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The entire concept of Razers Blade series represents a compromise, too: its a gaming laptop thats much smaller and more portable than almost any other PC gaming machine, but that comes at the sacrifice of the long-term upgradability that a desktop or even a bulkier laptop provides. Like Microsofts Surfaces or Apples MacBooks, the Blade is a closed machine  even the RAM is soldered down, and youll void your warranty just by cracking open the case. So whatever specs you buy it with are what youll be stuck with forever. Fortunately, the newly upgraded Blade packs some serious specs that should carry it for a couple of years. </TEXT>

Stark shouldn't even be in this movie.  It is like they were afraid of it failing so they brought in a few ringers. It's sad and pathetic. I don't thing I would watch it for free. How is it that they keep messing up these movies. Who thought Vulture would be a good villain for a movie?  I didn't even like him in the comics.  Who going to be the villain in the next movie, The Spot? Oh I know, It will be Mindworm! </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are many approaches to solar fuels: react carbon dioxide with water to produce hydrocarbons and less water. Another approach is to crack water to make hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen can be used directly or reacted with carbon dioxide (or carbon monoxide) to create hydrocarbons. In either case, the energy used to drive the processes is renewable, so you end up with carbon-neutral fuel. And, if you make a longish hydrocarbon chain, it will be liquid, which has some serious advantages with respect to storage and transport. </TEXT>

Corn is also turned into corn syrup and ethanol. Canada sometimes gets as much as 50% of us ethanol exports. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I said everything but detasseling could be done with just a few people. Detasseling takes about one to two weekends where I was. They hire the local teenagers and young adults. They drive them through the fields on the back of trailers and they remove the tassels.  They have few people follow behind to get one that were missed.

Watching them harvest corn is pretty interesting. They really have it down to a science.  The combine is all but automated, It drives in near perfect lines. Running along side the combine is a truck with an open trailer that the corn shots into. As the truck fills up, another takes it place.  Once a truck id full it drives to closest silo where it unloads and then goes back to the field.  The entire field is harvested by just a few drivers. I know a few tractor companies are about to start selling automated combines.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It hot, dirty muddy, dusty job. You a get sinus filled with corn pollen.  Even with sunblock you tend to get sunburned,. They paid $15 an hour so they never had problems finding workers. I did it once in high school.


Detasseling corn is removing the pollen-producing flowers, the tassel, from the tops of corn (maize) plants and placing them on the ground. It is a form of pollination control, employed to cross-breed, or hybridize, two varieties of corn.

Fields of corn that will be detasseled are planted with two varieties of corn. Every corn plant has both male and female parts, so if both varieties of corn were left intact, some of the resulting seeds would have non-hybrid parents. Removing the tassels from all the plants of one variety leaves the grain that is growing on those plants to be fertilized by the tassels of the other, resulting in a hybrid.

In addition to being more physically uniform, hybrid corn produces dramatically higher yields than corn produced by open pollination. With modern seed corn the varieties to hybridize are carefully selected so that the new variety will exhibit specific traits found in the parent plants. The detasseling process usually involves the use of both specialized machines and human labor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually corn cultivation really does not need that much migrant work unlike fruit which need plenty of migrant work.  With corn, Machines do most of the work the only real time you need temp workers is for detasseling and all teenagers in the local towns do that over the course of a weekend.  Beside detasseling, whole counties can be done by just a few people.
But this article is wrong. Japan currently is the Number one exporter. Mexico buys 23% And if the US has a surplus they just turn it into corn syrup which seems to be in everything now.

<TEXT> SATURDAY AM UPDATE: Disney's Beauty and the Beast is looking at a monster second weekend, appearing as if it might outperform even the most optimistic expectations after it brought in an estimated $23.6 million on Friday. Disney is estimating a weekend in the low-to-mid $80s while rival studios estimate it may actually top $90 million, dropping less than 50% for a second weekend that will rank in the all-time top five as it pushes well over $300 million in just ten days.

Elsewhere, Lionsgate's Power Rangers is leading the weekend's new releases raking in nearly $15 million on Friday, heading toward a three-day opening in the low $40 millions. The film scored an "A" CinemaScore from opening day audiences, of which 30% were under the age of 18 and scored the film an "A+".

Sony's Life brought in an estimated $4.4 million heading toward a three-day weekend around $13 million while WB's CHiPs is performing mostly as expected, bringing in an estimated $2.6 million on Friday, heading toward a three-day around $7.6 million.

You can check out all of Friday estimates right here and we'll be back tomorrow morning with a complete look at the weekend estimates. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Ricky Ross, one of Gary Webb's primary sources had spoken to Gary in the days before his death. Gary told Ricky that he had seen men scaling down the pipes outside his home and that they were obviously not burglars but 'government people'. Gary also told Ricky that he had been receiving death threats and was being regularly followed. It was also mentioned that Gary was working on a new story concerning the CIA and drug trafficking.

Gary described the men around his home as 'professionals' who jumped from his balcony and ran away when Gary confronted them


Original Associated Press reports stated that Webb had died of gunshot wounds (plural) to the face. This was later changed to 'single gunshot wound' when people began to question how or why a man would shoot himself in the face twice. This represents a concentrated effort to cover up the nature of Webb's death. There have also been reports that the coroner on the scene had originally reported 'multiple gunshot wounds' but later changed his story.

Newspapers also reported the fact that Webb's body was found by removal men without questioning why a man who was about to commit suicide would plan a house move.

Former DEA agent Cele Castillo concurs that Webb was murdered and that in such a 'revenge hit' situation it was common in his experience that the murderers would have likely talked to Webb at length about how and why they were about to kill him.

In a death of this nature a homicide investigation would be par for the course but the media is complicit in bleating like well-behaved sheep to the acceptance that this was a suicide."

<TEXT> Dick Durbin must be off his meds. The Senate's H-1B is SOOOO much better then Trumps.  The senate bill will double minimum wage and give power to police the system. Trumps plan is to auction the Visas to the highest bidder.  Why the hell would Durbin want Trump to Act? There is even talk about adding more to the bill that would stop a company from contracting their visa workers to other companies.  Companies like Infosys. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The researchers propose a "humanoid-bioreactor system" with "structures, dimensions, and mechanics similar to those of the human body." As the robot interacted with its environment, tissues growing on its body would receive the typical strains and twists that they would if they grew on an actual human. The result would be healthy tissue, grown for the exact area on the body it was destined to replace. Mouthuy and Carr note that this would be especially helpful for "bone-tendon-muscle grafts... because failure during healing often occurs at the interface between tissues." </TEXT>

The change allows backers to shelve a proposed "opportunity tax" that would charge companies for the "privilege" of doing business in the state. That ran into opposition from business groups. But the broad nature of the sales tax expansion is likely to spawn arguments that it hits hardest those least able to afford the increase." </TEXT>

<TEXT> A nonpartisan budget watchdog group is calling for dramatic action to get the states budget back on track, saying Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democrats are out of easy choices and need to consider raising taxes, among other things.

A five-year plan to be released Friday by the Civic Federation calls for a strict spending limit that caps growth at 1.7 percent a year, hiking the personal income tax rate from 3.75 percent to 5.25 percent, eliminating Illinois' tax exemption on retirement income and lowering the sales tax rate from 6.25 percent to 5.5 percent but expanding it to apply to more services.  </TEXT>

Also the concert was way to dark to film.  It greatly reduced my enjoyment of the concert.  Rob actually asked the crowd to put down their phones "for one fucking song" and they didn't do it.

<TEXT> he surgical device, called a power morcellator, has been on the market since 1991 and is FDA-approved for use in minimally invasive gynecological surgeries, including removing benign uterine tumors (fibroids). The device shreds tissue into small pieces so it can be removed from the body through small incisions. But in the event that a patient has an undiagnosed cancer, the device can fling cancer cells throughout the body, where they can seed new tumors. The first time the FDA got a report of this happening was in 2013and it was from a patient, not a doctor or hospital using the device. By that time, at least 50,000 US women were having surgery with the device a year, The New York Times reports. </TEXT>

He also told Variety that the program "was simply not set up to deal with the hard-core repeat infringer problem.

<TEXT> source one: Travel ban is an terrible but far from fascism

Source two: is not even news it a blog about someone worried that the Trump admin might manipulate numbers like every other presidency has.

Source three: Again, the travel ban is not not fascism

Source four: is article about Steve Bannon speaking about a war with ISIS.

Source five: Huff Post is far from a creditable source and again, the travel ban is not not fascism

Source Six: is an article about who trump is handing over his company too. If he was a fascist then he would refuse to turn over his company and arrest anyone that complained about it.

Source Seven:  Again I HATE how trump did this ban but again that is not fascism.

Source eight: again this is about the ban. CEOs being afraid  to speak out about the ban.  Sound like the CEOs are cowards. Many others spoke out and nothing happened. If Trump was a fascist he would have put all the CEO and media outlets in work camps.  

source nine:  A badly written speech is far from fascism.

source ten: is about a missing link on the whitehouse website that was restored 

Source eleven: is a  blog article from the observer(not news
) that compares trump to Hitler so that prove how unreliable the article is.  There was no coup

source 12: Again, the travel ban is not not fascism

source 13: Again, the travel ban is not not fascism

source 14: Is an interview with a angry bitter buthurt old man who said his new Prime Minister and Trump are walking hand in had with fascism.  If either were then he would be in jail or dead.  He is still angry about Brexit and his party losing power. 

So what else do you have? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Democratic Senate President John Cullerton and Minority Leader Christine Radogno told the Chicago Tribune editorial board last week, that they plan to put the proposal to a floor vote Wednesday. It would raise income taxes, borrow to pay off overdue bills, expand casino gambling, and freeze local property taxes. Cullerton said "the Senate must act quickly in part to fend off lobbyists lining up to kill parts of the plan."

Sounds like the lobbyists won. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dr Mark Post and his team at Maastricht University used these cells to grow 20,000 muscle fibres in individual culture wells, each one a tiny hoop of greyish-white protein suspended in a gel-like growth medium that contained antibiotics and a serum extracted from cow foetuses.

After a few weeks of growth, each hoop of fibre was removed by hand, cut open and straightened out. The fibres were then pressed together, coloured with beetroot juice and mixed with saffron, breadcrumbs and some binding ingredients to form the burger  biologically identical to beef, but grown in a lab. The total cost of the project was 250,000 (215,000), funded by Google co-founder Sergey Brin. </TEXT>

<TEXT>    The hacked databasewhich appears to be one of the largest ever single data breaches in historyapparently contains account details for numerous adult properties belonging to the California-based Friend Finder Network, and includes customers' e-mail addresses, IP addresses last used to log-in to the site, and passwords.


   According to data breach notification site LeakedSource.com, the passwords were either kept in plain text format, or used the largely discredited SHA1 hashing algorithm. It claimed to have cracked 99 percent "of all available passwords" which "are now visible in plaintext."


   This is the second data breach at Friend Finder Network in the past 18 months. The first, in May 2015, uncovered personal details for 3.5 million active users of the site, including questions on their sexual preferencesdata which apparently wasn't compromised this time around.

<TEXT> They have a terrible shortage of priests. It is so bad most are not allowed to retire.  This is a self inflicted wound.  All they would have to do is allow women to be priests and allow priests to wed.
 
"Worldwide, the number of priests in 1970 was 419,728. In 2012, there were a total of 414,313 priests. While the total number of priests worldwide has therefore remained about the same since 1970, the Catholic population has nearly doubled, growing from 653.6 million in 1970 to 1.229 billion in 2012.[2] In 2012 the global number of candidates for the priesthood also showed its first decline in recent years."

<TEXT> Instead these candidates bickering back and forth on same thing the two have over decades, shouldn't they be discussing the near future where are going be fewer and fewer jobs with automation.  I listened last night was amused by how both have their own plans for bringing jobs back.  We are on the cusp of an automation revolution and that is what they should be discussing.  How can either of them claim to have a plan to bring jobs back when so many will be replaced?  Is it their age?

The sad thing about the game whales is they don't get special treatment.  Most games now even take more advantage of these whales by not letting buy what they want.  They now sell them a change to get what they want.     For example they will sell them a magic chest they will contain one random rare item.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Crazy Blonde Brownie </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-22 21:27:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ingredients:
1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) butter

2 cups brown sugar, lightly packed

2 large eggs

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1/2 teaspoon butterscotch or vanilla-butternut flavor, optional

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 cup Whole Wheat Flour

3/4 cup All-Purpose Flour

2 teaspoons baking powder

2 1/2 cups chocolate, butterscotch, or cinnamon chips; toffee bits, or a combination

1 cup diced pecans or walnuts



Instructions
Preheat your oven to 350F. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan. Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan. Add the brown sugar, and stir until the mixture is smooth.
Remove the pan from the heat, pour the butter-sugar mixture into a medium-sized bowl, and allow it to cool to lukewarm. Add the remaining ingredients, except the chips and nuts, stirring to combine. Fold in the chips and nuts.
Spread the mixture evenly in the pan, and bake the brownies for 30 to 35 minutes, until they're light brown on the edges and top. Remove them from the oven, loosen their edges with a table knife, and cool completely before cutting.

<TEXT> Did you even read my post? I never said they didn't work hard I said it was unskilled labor.  I worked at two different fast food restaurants.  Then I went to college and got the skill-set that allowed me to have a higher paying job.  Then I got paid for classes to get certifications that then help me obtain even better jobs.  I didn't graduate high school and expect me to paid well.  That is the whole reason for going to college.  California should NOT be raising min wage, it should be making community college free.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Prompted by AT T, Missouri passed a state law in 1997 that hamstrings towns and cities looking to build local networks to shore up broadband coverage gaps. Since then, AT T has made repeated attempts to expand those restrictions further, fearing a growing rise in public/private partnerships from the likes of Google Fiber, Ting, or the countless towns and cities tired of AT T's pricey, slow broadband service. After a failed attempt last year, AT T this year introduced protectionist bill HB 2078, shortly after shoveling $62,000 in campaign contributions to state leaders.  </TEXT>

OG = 1.096 FG = 1.020

IBU = 65 SRM = 63 ABV = 10.7%

16.5 lbs. (7.5 kg) 2-row pale malt

2 lbs. (0.91 kg) amber malt

1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) roasted barley (500 L)

1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) black malt

20.8 AAU Warrior hops (60 min.) (1.3 oz/37 g at 16% alpha acids)

White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) yeast (3 qt./3 L yeast starter)

<TITLE> $1.50 Falafel Lunches </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-12 17:31:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I used Guy Fieris Falafel Recipe, but I took out the tomatoes and used flour tortillas instead of pitas. I cooked all the falafel then individually froze them on a cookie sheet. Once frozen I stored them in a bag in the freezer. Then then I just defrosted around five of them when I wanted a lunch. The recipe cost me $15 to make but it provided me with 10 lunches. $1.50 a lunch and it is pretty healthy.
If you don't have a food processor, you can get by with a blender.
