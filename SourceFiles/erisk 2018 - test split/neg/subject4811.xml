<TEXT> Here's an update to the situation. I'll be sure to post the next part soon!

I dont remember much of how I got back up to my house. The clouds above broke with the force of a monsoon. Though the dense tree cover afforded some shelter, a good amount of it filtered through and soon I was drenched. I couldnt care less.

Visions of my dog were burned into my retinas. His broken body, his gentle eyes, that thumping tail, the nest of pale purple innards going taught and yanking my dog away. And now the ball. 

Wanna play? It was a taunt. Visceral and foreboding. Choking back a sob, I gathered the ball in my arms and began scrambling back up the embankment. 

Somewhere in my mind, the sensible part of my conscience screamed bloody murder at me to get out of there. Whatever had done that to my dog was ravenous, predatory, and ruthless. I could do nothing against it now. I was nothing but a wiry kid who saw something no one should have to see. For once I listened to the logical part of my mind and got out of there like a bat out of hell.

As I scrambled up the embankment, sobbing and shuddering, I heard a sound I will never forget. The squish of teeth scissoring through flesh and the final whimpers of our beloved pet. 

I was pallid by the time I broke free of the thick ivy. My black hair was a mop of tangles and mud, braided with twigs, leaves, and crusted blood. The ball was clutched under one arm. I had planned to show it to my parents, as proof of the monster that had ripped apart our dog, but the rain and my jacket had smeared it. I tossed it aside as I dashed into the garage, shouting for my parents. 

It was half past 6 in the morning, around the time my parents usually got up. My dad, bleary eyed and dressed in a bathrobe, was the first to here me. He was pouring himself a cup of coffee and ended up drenching himself with it. His curses joined my cries as my mom pounded down the stairs. She was probably fixing herself up for another day of moving boxes, but now she charged into the kitchen, looking half prepared and half asleep.

When she saw my father clutching a burned hand and me huddled on a kitchen chair, sobbing, she almost laughed. Perhaps she thought something funny had happened. That Id scared my dad when he was getting coffee by accident and now we were both reacting to a loud, uncertain situation. She was half right. 

My mom is a wonderful woman, average height, shoulder-length brown hair, bright blue eyes, and always patient. When she realized the true gravity of the situationnamely by looking at the raw fear spread over my face, she kicked into high gear.

As I lay slumped over the dining table, she crossed the kitchen and dug out an ice packet for my father. Then she sat him at the sink, turned the faucet on at high blast, and told him to hold it there no matter how much of a mess it made. My father complied with a stream of gentle curses. 

Then she turned to me. I felt her arms slip around my sides and pull me against her. Whats wrong, sweetie? she said softly. 

I-IDysonI sa-saw somethingterrible. D-Dyson. Down the hill. Dead. B-b-bleeding, monster, ate him, ivy! The words wouldnt come out in cohesive sentences. Instead they were a torrent of abstract sounds pieced together in a way that made my mom look to my dad with a hes in shock expression. 

Sweetheartwe know you miss him. But hes only been gone a day. You had a nightmare. My mom stroked my hair, picking out the twigs and leaves. Were you searching for him?

I nodded and shuddered, my thin shoulders shivering under my jacket. She seemed to realize my clothes were soaked through and she added delirium to her list of reasons for my bumbling. She slid my coat off, then my shirt, and wrapped a towel around me. 

All the while my dad watched from the sink, a thoughtful look on his face. His hand, which had minor reddening and one or two blisters, was already looking better. He flexed his hand as he looked at me. I dont think thats shock, Karen. Ive never seen him like this before. 

My mom nodded thoughtfully. Well lets make sure both of you are alright before we jump to conclusions. She moved over to the refrigerator and began rummaging through our meager rations for breakfast stuff. My mom always did that. Filling in uncertainties with something comforting. In this case it was blueberry pancakes and orange juice. She sent me upstairs to get changed and bandaged my dads hand in gauze in the time it took for the first pair of pancakes to toast. 

As I got changed, my heart rate decreased enough to feel somewhat normal, but the visceral images of my poor dog lingered. The memories were sharp as ever, yet mercifully surreal to a certain extent. I peered down into the green abyss for a moment, envisioning all the things it could hide. What could have done something like that to a family pet? Let alone a large one? And the ballthe most unnerving aspect of all. Whatever tore Dyson apart could write and it was sadistic enough to taunt a child. 

Wanna play? 

I shook my head and headed back down to the kitchen where I at least had company. 

My mom gave me a sympathetic look as I eased myself at the table. Outside the rain poured down with a vengeance, turning the world into an expanse of muted greens and silvers. I dug into the pancakes while my parents talked to one another in hushed tones. 

Words like disturbed, exhausted, young, shock, and frozen, trickled through my mind, but it didnt bother me. I was only ten. I had seen something gut wrenching to the point where even I questioned its existence, and adults had a way of rationalizing the words of a kid to the point where they could be easily discounted. I knew what I said was difficult to believe, but at the very least my father vouchsafed my explanation with a second look. 

He wanted me to show him where I had seen Dyson. I gulped down a piece of pancake and reluctantly agreed. We waited for the rain to subside, and in that time I managed to convince my father to bring a gun in case there really was some sort of rabid animal. As a hunter, he was pragmatic enough to entertain the possibility of some sort of predator inhabiting the ravines. 

My mom spent the time busying herself with the dishes and then continuing on projects around the house. That was something I noticed early on about my parents. My mom took difficult news like it was a chore, because that way she could turn it into something useful. 

My dad was different. He a big, lanky guy who took difficult news in a somber way and mulled it over in his mind until he came to terms with it. When I fled up that hill and into the house, choking on my own sobs, thered been a brief moment where he read the sheer panic on my face. He was thinking about what could scare a kid that bad. Only that pot of coffee burning his hand kept him from digging any further. 

Now he flexed his burned hand and loaded a .410 pistol outfitted for shotgun slugs. It was meant as a deterrent for larger game that might charge us in the woods, but I wasnt sure if anything could stop whatever could tear a full-grown lab open and drag him back with the ferocity Id seen. And that ballit flashed endlessly in my head as my dad slid five shells home.

Click. The ball rolled forward from the ivy.

Click. The reddish brown words burned into my retinas.

Click. Wanna play? 

Click. Wanna play? Wanna play? Wanna play? 

Click. My dad chambered the final round and slid the cylinder home. 

Ready, bud? He gave me a small grin. There was stubble on his face and rings under his eyes.

Yeah, I said reluctantly, a shudder catching in my chest. I almost told him about the ball, but remembered it was blood-free now. If I mentioned it, my dad would probably just leave me behind. 

Together we went into the garage and donned our boots, all-weather pants, jackets, and fluorescent vests. As we prepped, my dad looked out into the trees with a newfound interest. You know, its funny, he said, slipping the pistol into its holster, I dont think Ive ever seen thicker vegetation in my life. Working through that stuff yesterday, great workout. He patted his vested stomach, Guess we can work off those pancakes your mom made. 

Yeah, I said again. I could tell he was trying to keep things light-hearted, but that just made things worse. I just want him back.

My dad nodded as we crossed the driveway and stopped at the edge of the rain-slicked ivy. In the overcast it looked black as oil, gross and slimy to the touch. Well find him, he assured me, I promise. 

Yeah, I thought, that was the terrifying part. 

Together we descended into the deep-green void. Much like my previous trip, the going was slow and the vegetation ominous. Everything below the sixty-foot mark was plunged into a perpetual twilight, illuminated by a hollow, yellow light. Beneath the initial canopy of broadleaves, ivy-clad giants and stunted, black trees reined supreme. Our footing was constantly tested by the tangles of vines and little, green leaves so dark they looked black. 

In spite of my fathers company and that pistol hanging from his hip, I couldnt shake the feeling that every moment we spent here was perilous. We didnt belong in places like this. We only visited it, hunted the creatures that inhabited it, and left before we realized we were out of our depth. I began to imagine this as another hunt. For something other than whatever we were currently looking for.

To make matters worse, I couldnt shake the feeling that we were being observed. From some vantage point in this twisted, hidden world of ivy-choked vegetation, an entity watched us. I wondered if it had watched Dyson, too. Perhaps curious as to why the dog would return to its domain. Or why I would either, for that matter, after the horrendous things Id seen. 

I found the tunnel entrance with relative ease this time around. A ten-foot opening smothered in cascades of rugged greenery. I began trembling as visions of my slaughtered dog returned. My dad had to take my hand and gentle guide me around the edge of the sewer. He left his gun holstered, but unhooked the strap around its grip which made me feel a little better. 

We knelt at the entrance of the tunnel, quiet as sin. A foul odor breathed through the vined-entrance, causing me to choke. Rotting meat. 

My dad plugged his nose too, but he only laughed. Whew, that sewage is nasty. Hope you didnt flush anything toxic down here in the past hour.

My vision swam. The smell was sickening to me, not laughably disgusting. It reeked of decay and malcontent, like the corpse of an animal struck on the highway. My dad thought it was just a backdraft of sewagethe type of stench you plugged your nose at and looked for someone to jokingly pin it on. 

Dadits not sewage. Its Dysonremember what I said? 

He tugged at the bandages on his sore hand and wiped the sweat off his brow. Like me, he had thick, black hair, streaked faintly with grey. It made him look older now as a hint of sadness weighed down on his efforts to remain humorous. I know, son. I know what you told me, butwhy would he go in there? Why would anything live in there? Itd screw up their scent pattern and-

Just look in there, dad. I was panicking. If he didnt believe me enough to at least look, then I was on my own.

My dad sighed and nodded. All right, step back for me then. He took out his gun in case there really was some animal lying in wait. Perhaps a rabid coyote or cougar holed itself up. 

I stepped back and waited as my father softly drew the vines back. He flicked on a flashlight in his other hand and rolled its beam all over the entrance to the sewer. I craned my neck, expecting to see some terrible black beast looking back, but there was nothing. His beam reached fifty feet back, illuminating more of the same cruddy, rusted out corridor. Some limp plants hung from the sides of the wall, and a faint line of scummy water filled the bottom. Aside from the dinginess of the place, it was remarkably ordinary. No blood, no guts, no fur or skin or bits of bone. My dog was gone, devoured or taken somewhere else. 

Well its certainly creepy, my dad laughed, trying once more to lighten the atmosphere. I can see why you think Dyson mightve disappeared in there.

I shook my head. Nosomething pulled him in. I dont know what it was, but I saw it. 

My dad rubbed my shoulders and pointed to the where the extremity of his beam faded out. It caved in. Its hard to tell with the metal being the same color, but theres a wall of dirt. Dyson couldnt have gone this way.

I bumbled at the revelation, searching frantically for an explanation. My dad seemed content with letting me talk, but he wasnt listening anymore. For him, wed achieved resolution. He holstered his pistol and began to lead the way back up. 

I followed slowly, numbed by the feeling that I really mightve hallucinated the entire thing. Guilt, grief, exhaustion, all of those conglomerating into a delusion that removed my part of the blame. I dont understand why I would imagine something so horrendous, and neither did my parents. And they didnt want to know where there child came up with such atrocities, so they pandered me for an appropriate amount of time, before delivering their own explanation. Which I was ready to accept as I steadily clambered up the hill. 

At least until I felt something tug at my jacketa draft of wind being sucked into the tunnel, trying to take me along with it. Something about that felt wrong, but I was too dejected to investigate. All I knew was that wind didnt blow through a dead space. There was probably another entrance. 

After we rejoined the modern world at the top of the ravine and shrugged out of our hunting attire, I was ready to focus on something else. I guess that was my moms doing. I wanted to find something to occupy myself for the rest of the day, and my dad was all to happy to oblige. 

We spent the rest of that day painting the kitchen and living room walls in a light shade of yellow. It fit the homes spacious, contemporary furnishings, and warded off the oppressive greenery around us. 

That night I fall asleep with little trouble. The shadows of the swaying trees above me lulled me into a hypnosis again, and I stayed that way until I was on the precipice of slumber. Just as I was ready to pass out once again, the scratching returned. As ever, it was a frantic, pitiful sound. Thin shadows darted along the space between my door and the floor, and I watched them passively. Fear mingled with the desire to sleep, and for once I let sleep win me out. The scratching faded with the darkness.

The next morning I awoke at 6:32. Rather early for me in spite of the past couple days wearing me down, but it felt good to be free of my bed. I got dressed quickly, hearing my parents moving about down the hall as well. 

As I slid a bright green shirt sporting the logo of some tacky restaurant over my head, the memory of the scratching returned. I shuffled over to my door curiously and opened it to check for a detail I hadnt thought of before: claw marks. Whenever Dyson slid on our wooden floors, my mom always flipped out about the scratched he would leave, but I never saw him inflict too much damage. Just a small graze amid the thousands of our home.

The base of my door was scratch-free, however. Not a mark where I expected a tons of them to be. I scanned the small lip of wood where the doorframe met the floor and gave it a closer look. I started on the left side and moved right, taking in every inch of the raised wood. Something caught my eye when I got within a couple inches of the right frame. 

It was small and faint, carved in the same sketchy righting as the blood-smeared ball: We gonna play somedaaaaay!

I shuddered at the childish enthusiasm. It was the type of writing one could expect from an adult talking to a kid or a dog. Condescending and syrupy. I gagged at the thought that whatever killed my dog mightve thought it was only playing. Tug of war with his guts? There was no way. No way. My mind reeled at the message, trying to dampen the fear blossoming in my chest. But then a bone-scorching scream from downstairs shot that fear through me like a bolt. 

I scrambled downstairs in seconds, my father two steps ahead of me. This time he and I were careful not to jostle one another for fear of another accident as we stumbled into the kitchen. We found my mom standing paralyzed in the kitchen, a glass shattered at her feet. She was gaping at our refrigerator. 

My heart was seized in a cold fist as I saw the gristly sight too. A thin line of blood trickled down along the sleek metal surface of the fridge, coming from a long, ragged, yellow tail nailed into the fridge door. It looked as if it had been brutally hacked off, with a couple vertebrae dangling from the thicker end. 

My dad cursed and swept my mom up in his arms, while I watched on. If this was a game to whatever had done this, was the horrific sight before me some twisted variation of pin-the-tail? I didnt want to know, didnt care too. All I knew was that we were being toyed with in a sadistic childs game. And whatever the thing was had invited my parents to play as well.

<TEXT> When I was about ten years old, my family moved. We ventured to a semi-suburban part of Georgia, where my parents opted for one of the older neighborhoods rather than the newer clusters of uniform homes. 

The neighborhood we selectedIvy Cascadespossessed a haphazard layout, with the homes and roads built along the tops of deep ravines and steep hillsides. My parents settled on an older, two-story brick home situated at the top of one of those ravines. 

I remember standing on our driveway, looking down that hill in wonder. It was one endless expanse of ivy, with thickets of underbrush, weeds, and trees clinging to the precipitous banks. I tried as hard as I could to make out the bottom, but it was lost in the green swirls of foliage. 

As we moved everything into the home, I gradually gained more and more freedom as my parents found less use for their scrawny son. I turned to the family dog for entertainment. Dyson, our two-year-old Labrador retriever named after a vacuum brand, took to our massive yard with glee. 

I hunted with my father, and wed trained Dyson to live up to his breed. Though he got distracted from time to time, the robust lab never seemed to tire of romps through the trees. To placate my boredom, I took Dyson out to the driveway and found a red ball in the garage for him to fetch. 

Together he and I made our way to the edge of the driveway. 

Cmon boy! Whats this? Wanna play? Wanna play?

Dyson nosed my legs and spun in circles, his eyes fixated on the ball. I tortured him a moment longer by holding it aloft, pretending not to know what he wanted before a pitiful whine finally broke my cruelty. I launched the ball as far as I could and Dyson went after it, a bolt of yellow shuffling down the deep ivy slope. 

My eyes stayed glued on the ball until it disappeared in the leaves. Never before had I thrown something so far or so high. I knew in reality it was the angle of the ravine, but still a sense of power swelled in my chest. 

I waited for my loyal friend to return, eager to try it again. It took longer than expected, but eventually Dyson reappeared, ball in jaw, slowly clambering up the side of the hill. The ravine mustve been deeper than I thought.

Once he crested the hill, he plopped onto one side, panting and happy. I eased the ball from his mouth and bounced it teasingly. He looked at me reluctantly, fighting between his desire to fetch and to loaf about. Eventually the retriever in him won out and he stood. 

With glee, I whipped the ball hard and long into the green abyss and Dyson followed it. This time I watched the dog rather than the ball. The lumbering, yellow animal had all the stealth of a bulldozer as he tromped down the ivy hill, but eventually he was swallowed up once more. 

I sat at the edge of the driveway, kicking my feet and enjoying the Georgia sun on my shoulders. It took a couple minutes longer this time around until I heard the rustles of my faithful lab trundling up the ravine again. He looked tired, but happy. A long, pink tongue poked out to one side of the ball as he picked his way up and reached the top of the incline. 

I hugged him tight and spoke to him in a sappy voice, telling him what a good boy he was in the way my father did when he retrieved a bird. There were a couple of scratches along his snout and jowls, but I figured they were from thorns or branches. He dropped the ball in my lap and pushed his head against my chest, clearly wanting more of the same treatment. I indulged him for another minute, building up to what I wanted in return. I held up the ball on more time and he whined. Something almost human glinted in his brown eyes. Hesitancy, perhaps? Fear?

I didnt listen. I shouldve, but I didnt. I was ten years old, infused with the power of throwing a ball farther and longer than perhaps any ten year old preceding me. Dyson pressed his head to my chest again as I stood. 

Cmon, boy, just one more time, I said, rubbing his ears. He wagged his tail a couple times, giving me enough reason to launch the ball once more.

Dyson followed after it loyally, navigating the ivy-laden terrain with impressive speed. I watched him go and sat down again to wait. The swirls of bright green leaves and deeper, emerald ivy soon drew me into a trance. They moved with the wind, relaxing me as I waited. I mustve held that trance for fifteen minutes, zoning in and out of the world around me. A thud from behind me caught my attention. It was my dad, dropping a couple boxes in the garage before the door slammed behind him.

I shifted my weight nervously. Dyson still hadnt returned. I waited for another ten minutes, then another five, then an extra ten to be safe, but there was no sign of him. There were a number of things I knew could have happened. When we went hunting there were always possibilities our dog would get distracted or injured. But this was a residential neighborhood, not the wilderness.

I went and got my dad. After explaining what happened, he told my mom to take me inside while he went looking. The thick vegetation would be difficult to navigate without the proper equipment, so he dressed in his hunting gear. My heart beat wildly as my mom tried to calm me, but I didnt listen to her. 

A sense of fear had been mounting in my chest. Not outright terror, but dread. Together, my mom and I waited for hours as my father combed the ravine and surrounding area. I could hear him tromping through the undergrowth, cursing on occasion as he slipped on dead leaves or some ivy. He found no sign of Dyson. 

We all came to the same hopeful conclusion that he got distracted and wandered off. That a neighbor had found him and would call us soon, but I could tell my father shared my doubts. That lab was trained, loyal, and able-bodied on difficult terrain. Rubbing his eyes, my dad told us wed continue to search tomorrowput out flyers, talk to people. Though it would be difficult seeing as wed just moved in. 

By the time my father had returned, it was close to nightfall. We opted for an early dinner, which passed in dreary silence, and then an early night. I went to bed after kissing my parents goodnight. My dad held my back for a moment, reassuring me and telling me this wasnt my fault. I suppose he thought it helped, but even at my age there was an awareness to these heavy situations where I knew some of the blame was mine. 

Sleep did not come. My bedroom, which sat at the back corner of the house with a big window overlooking the ravine, waved with leafy shadows. I watched them, falling into a similar trance as earlier that day. Hours passed this time, but I didnt care. The shadows were comforting in a way, just an endless sea of leaves. 

Im not sure when the scratching started, but I noticed it when my clock read 2:38. It was a feeble, pathetic sound, emanating from the base of my door. It sounded very much like someone was digging at it from the other side. I shivered and leaned over my bed to lower my eyeline with the space beneath the door. I could just make out something black scrabbling at the wood flooring. It dug with ferocity. 

Gulping down my fear, I let my hope of Dysons possible return guide me to the door. I slipped across the room, feeling the shadows accompany my movements as I neared the door. Slowly, I grasped the door handle and yanked the door open to revealnothing. 

An empty hallway with boxes cluttered at the other end and patchy spots of paint covering the wall. At the other end, the hallway dead-ended at a curving staircase, which led to the front door. My thin chest was pulsing as I lingered in the doorway of my room for any sounds. Part hope and part fear kept there, wanting it to be Dyson or for it to be nothing at all. Worst of all it could be something else. I heard the scratching again.

It came from down the hall. From down the stairs. Outside the front door. For a moment I considered just going back to bed, but guilt and longing for my dog lead me through that hall, down the stairs, and to the front door. This time I didnt hesitate. I could hear the scratching at our door, clear as a bell. I grabbed the handle and yanked it open. 

Nothing again. Just an empty stoop and a brick walkway leading off to the driveway. With a sigh, I shut the door and went back to my room. The adrenaline wore off pretty quick. My PJs were soaked with sweat, so I got changed before climbing back into bed. This time sleep came quite quickly.

Something awoke me at 5:42 in the morning. I wasnt sure what. Outside it was a dark grey overcast with just the barest hints of sunlight creeping through. I didnt hear scratching, or see shadows on my ceiling, or black things clawing at my door. It felt oddly surreal and tranquil. I slipped from my bed and got dressed. There was something I wanted to see. 

I slipped into the garage and opened it from within. It slid open slowly, so I ducked under it. From there I crept to the edge of the ravine again and peered into it, trying to find the bottom. I wasnt sure how far or deep my dad had ventured down there the day before, but hed been gone for hours. He didnt know about the scratching, either. Why couldnt my father, an experienced hunter, find our big, yellow dog in the middle of a suburban neighborhood? 

I tried to focus. My ten-year-old mind envisioned nothing but my father and my dog descending down into the same ravine. Both were trained, both were comfortable in the wilderness, both had every reason to come home. Then a revelation hit me. Or at least the most logical solution a kid could think of. My dad had been searching for our dog, and our dog had been searching for a ball. 

You didnt look for dead things the way you did for the living. Yes, this dead thing was a toy, but a search for an inanimate object was more invasive than a hunt. My dad wouldve scanned the area for our dog, but Dyson, in his search for the ball, wouldve probed it. Invaded it with his heightened sense of smell. And hed been successful the first two times. Something went wrong that last time. I had to discover what. 

Rubbing my chin, I headed back to the garage and dug through a couple boxes until I found what I wanted: another rubber ball. 

It was a long shot, even for a kid, but I could think of nothing else. Plus the sky above was an ominous grey, with shaggy clouds so dark they looked purple. I needed to do this now. 

Treading back to the edge of my driveway, I gripped the ball in my slim hands. It was neon blue, so at least it would stand out. I took it in one hand, cocked my arm, and lobbed it down the slope. As it sailed down, I slid after it, skidding through thick tangles of ivy. 

The ravine was deeper than I thought. Far deeper. At least five hundred feet of sheer, dead-leaf covered slope shrouded in a layer of foliage thicker than the cloud cover above. As I descended I noticed something else. The trees that grew along the ravines precarious edges darkened all that was beneath in a perpetual twilight. Everything looked stunted and gnarled, with stubbier trees and pitiful bushes fighting for the limited sunlight shining through their brethren. 

I made the mistake of touching one of these trees, and pulled back to find its trunk slimy and moist. A black, oily substance coated my fingers. I had to keep from gagging as I reminded myself why I was here. There was a ball somewhere further down, so I kept on going. 

As I delved deeper into the rotting depths of the ravine, I noticed that the only plant life that did not change was the ivy. It blanketed the slope in emerald tendrils, stealing its share of the light and choking other plants. More than once I saw trees absolutely covered by its infestuous dominance. The trees resembled giants, taken over by time and petrified under cloaks of ivy. 

I kept searching for the ball, hoping to spot a spark of artificial blue in the world of undulating greens, browns, and blacks. The further I went, the thicker the ivy grew. 

My method of descent was to press myself against the leaves and slip down little by little. My left foot was extended in front of me and the right remained hitched to the side of the hill. I continued to slide, feeling my way around and trying to ignore the ivy giants hunched over me.

About halfway down, my left foot hit a deadfallsome leaves caked atop a cluster of rootsand it broke through before I realized I hit empty air. I tumbled forward, crying out and slammed into the dirt hard. It didnt hurt terribly, but the impact did knock the wind from my lungs. I sucked in a breath, gaping like a fish as I scrambled to my feet. A clod of mud and roots lodged itself in my hair, and I shook it free. 

Something glinted in the corner of my eye. The ball. It lay nestled at the base of a large cascade of ivy, which hung limp like a curtain. I mustve fallen off the top of that thing. 

I reached forward to pick up the ball, but cut my finger on something sharp when I tightened my hand around it. Quickly I withdrew my hand, sucking on the finger and tasting the liquid as it seeped forth. Once I staunched the flow, I took a closer look. 

Whatever cut me was metal, rusty, and curved. It seemed to stick out perpendicularly from the slope at a similar angle to the cascade of ivy. I guessed it was an old sewer opening, completely congested by the surrounding wildlife. A cold feeling of unease slithered down my back, similar to what Id felt that night. Above a low peal of thunder echoed through the trees, but I would be damned if I headed back now. 

Ever so carefully, I leaned forward and lifted one of the strands. Something dull and brown glinted back at mean. I almost screamed until I realized it was my dog, his eyes kind and gentle. Id found him!

I leaned forward to give him a hug, but he growled softly, remaining absolutely still. I looked at his eyes. Something almost human resided there. His tail thumped softly, but the rest of him remained shrouded by ivy. I tentatively reached a hand forward and lifted another vine free. Dyson licked my hand once as I screamed and recoiled.

He lay on his side, a massive wound torn through his middle. The poor labs intestines were strewn out on the cruddy metal floor, snaking back into the darkness of the tunnel. My heart pulsed and my ears roared as blood rushed to my head. I almost threw up, but my dog, for the final time, gave me that almost human look. Just before something yanked on his guts and pulled him back into the darkness with an inhuman screech.

I sat there, babbling, pale, and cold. I had thrown a ball down that ravine three times, and hed retrieved it every time in spite of whatever resided in that sewer. I knew I had to get out of there, to get away. My lab warded me off with his growl, saved me. But I couldnt move. 

I peered into the darkness, tears flowing freely and mixing with the blood staining my hands. Then something bounced forward, out of the darkness. It was a ball. A red ball. 

It was crusted in blood and two words were smeared along its surface. 

Wanna play?

<TEXT> I walked into the wrong apartment...I must have. There's a man sitting at a table very much like mine. His face is covered with something red. Strings of yellow and pink are dangling from his mouth. He looks rabid. I am trying very hard not to make a sound as I back away from him, my hand is scrabbling behind me for the doorknob. 

I bump something.

The man turns. His face is smeared with meat and gooey red matter. He looks startled, but smiles, extending a chunk of that horrendous substance toward me. 

"Want some?"

I turn pale as a sheet and turn around to yank the door open, only glimpsing the number on the apartment for a split second. Wrong number. Thank god. I run as fast as I can for safety.

Back in the apartment the man takes another bite of his meat-lovers pizza and shakes his head. "Crazy vegans."
