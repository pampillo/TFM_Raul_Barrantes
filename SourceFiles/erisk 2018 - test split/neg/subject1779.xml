<TEXT> Why feel guilty? It's not as if there's anything actually wrong with being able to frequently visit the Omaha zoo.

If anything, you're doing a very good thing encouraging others to go--the more that go and give Omaha some of their money, the more services for the animals the zoo will be able to do. Some of their programs are very important to helping endangered species. 

I've only been to the San Diego Safari Park once, but I'll never miss an opportunity to recommend it.

I also went to the San Francisco Zoo a lot as a kid--and from what I've heard, they've actually improved dramatically in recent years.  </TEXT>

Alternatively, which films do you feel best exemplify motherhood?

My favorite author, and a firearms expert, wrote an essay on the subject on gun control, and included several passages on the idea of teachers wielding guns to protect schools.

It's a very long read, but well worth it.

<TEXT> A mixture of things.

Caillou has two basic episode types---one where he learns something in a new environment (camping, a trip to the aquarium, the elementary school for "Little Brother or Sister [or Neighbor] Day"), or one where he must learn to get along with people.

The former episodes aren't that bad, but they're not that good either. Anything Caillou does has already been done, and done better, by Arthur and his friends or Franklin the Turtle or Little Bear or Richard Scarry's cast.

Caillou has a very irritating voice, as far as children show characters are concerned.

And then there's the episodes where Caillou must learn to get along with others. And they're not well-liked, and for good reason. 

One particularly notorious episode revolves around Caillou getting ready to go to the circus. He throws a tantrum when he learns that the circus trip isn't *today,* it's *tomorrow.*
Rather than a lesson in patience or carefully planning events, Caillou pouts and whines until his family put on their own little circus at home. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TV Show: *How I Met Your Mother,* Season Six. Episode "Bad News" ends with Marshall stunned to learn of his father's death. 

The twist is that Jason Segel's script didn't include that revelation, so his heartbroken shock and stammer of "My dad's dead?" is genuine.

Movie: *The Avengers,* specifically when the team is beginning to organize and examine the scepter. Tony Stark waltzes in and offers Bruce Banner a blueberry. 

That's not only unscripted, but Robert Downey Jr. apparently would hide food on the set and then eat it when he was hungry. So not only was the line not in the script, neither was the eating of blueberries.

Honorable Mention: This must be a thing with Robert Downey Jr. In the film *Captain America: Civil War,* there's a scene where Tony Stark is talking to Peter Parker and Stark asks Parker to move his leg so he can sit down. 

That's real. Tom Holland, who played Peter Parker, was star-struck and forgot his precise seating position. So Downey asked him to scoot over and they kept it in.

Edit: I can't count. It was Season Six.

<TEXT> The sequels actually have their share of dark themes as well.

"Goes to Mars" flat-out states that the appliances intend to destroy the Earth with a nuclear missile. There's also the elements of planned obsolescence, with machines falling apart far earlier than their predecessors. 
Also, Toaster and his friends, notably Kirby, accept their fate as objects that are not intended to last forever--Kirby affirms that "There's no shame in wearing out, if you've done what you've been built for."

"To the Rescue" has its share of darkness too. Sebastian the Monkey was experimented on in a disgusting animal laboratory, his arm mutilated, and then shown to the audience via silhouette. When Radio accidentally breaks the rare tube required to fix the supercomputer, he pulls out his own to use instead--effectively killing himself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The book is even sadder.

The hound and the fox aren't friends at all. They're mortal enemies and the hunter trains the hound to hunt the fox, after the fox causes the death of another hound.

But the fox is clever and the hound is a proud hunter. And as their world becomes more and more modernized, and less and less wild they become more reliant on each other, since it's the only thing that is familiar.

The fox loses his first mate and kits to the hound and the hunter. He also watches as his woods become smaller. Worst of all, he watches his fellow foxes, not become extinct, but become less and less civilized. His neighbor foxes stop mating for life and resort to scavenging garbage, instead of hunting game.

The hound's master is constantly told by the townsfolk to retire to an old folks' home. One that does not allow dogs.

The book climaxes with the hunter and hound chasing the fox one final time, after an outbreak of rabies. The fox collapses from exhaustion and dies, and the hound is near death as well. The hunter nurses him back to health, but then is once again pressured to the retirement home. The book ends with the tearful hunter picking up his shotgun, and taking his ancient hound outside one final time.

<TEXT> Mind if I chime in? I love the big cats and have lots of random facts about them.

The term "panther" is generally thought to refer to black jaguars, or more traditionally black leopards. Bagheera from "The Jungle Book" is probably the best known black panther.

However, the term "panther" can be used to refer to any of the five species of cat in the genus Panthera. The lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, and jaguar are all "panthers" in this respect.

These five species are also commonly called "Big Cats," an informal classification which also includes cheetahs and cougars in popular vernacular. Clouded leopards are occasionally grouped in here as well. Independently of this, cougars are sometimes called "panthers."

"Panther" is a term most commonly associated with melanism.
Melanism is a genetic condition that leads to an abundance of pigmentation, and is the opposite of albinism. Albinism is the complete lack of pigmentation, and must not be confused with leucism (a lack of most pigmentation--except for melanin).

Classic example of melanism include the black leopard and black jaguar. There have been very few reports of black lions or black tigers, but as far as I know, they've never been confirmed. What have been confirmed are pseudo-melanistic tigers, which have a more heavily striped coat and are actually somewhat smaller than their normal cousins. Conversely, the golden tabby tiger has been observed. As the name suggests, it has no dark stripes. It should also be noted that while the pseudo-melanistic tiger has been observed in the wild, the golden tabby tiger is strictly a captive beast, having been bred accidentally from white tigers.

Outside of anecdotal reports, African lions do not appear to exhibit melanism. However, there is at least one, potentially, partially-melanistic individual that has a leg that is noticeably darker in color than the rest of its body.

Despite many sightings, there has never been an authenticated account of a pure black melanistic cougar.

That said, native tribes of Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and Spanish explorers, told of "Onza." Similar to the mountain lion in most respects, it was said to be slimmer and some specimens had pale brown stripes on their legs, and most intriguingly had non-retractable claws. It was also said to be ferocious, capable of taking down fully armored conquistadors in broad daylight.

A cat was shot in 1986 matching the description of the onza and was found to be a mountain lion. So, "onza" appears to be a sufficiently rare mutation of mountain lion.

For what it's worth, cheetahs are among the only members of the cat family that have non-retractable claws, and they are the species most closely related to mountain lions. Several cryptozoologists hypothesized that the onza had been a relic of the American cheetah, which lived during the Ice Age.

As previously mentioned, melanism is the opposite of albinism. While there have been a handful of albino individuals among the Panthera species, the White Tigers and White Lions are more well-known. White tigers and lions are not albinos. White lions have the aforementioned condition, leucism, though the genes of white tigers are a bit more complicated.

Most white tigers have chocolate brown stripes and blue eyes, compared to the red eyes characteristic of albino individuals. So-called "stripeless" white tigers have been reported, and this is likely due to inbreeding. And again, the genes that cause it are similar to, but not identical to, leucism.

White Lions have a broader range of color, appearing anywhere from blond to white.

Finally, there is the King Cheetah. Similar to the pseudo-melanistic tiger, King Cheetahs have a majestic coat that features bars and stripes as opposed to the polka dot pattern characteristic of cheetahs. When originally discovered, they were believed to be hybrids of leopards and cheetahs. Conversely, there exists a single known specimen of a spotless cheetah.

************

While it is popularly assumed that only lions live in groups, this is not strictly true. While most cats are indeed solitary, male cheetahs have been seen to form small groups of two or three, occasionally more. Called coalitions, these groups tend to be made up of brothers of the same litter, but some coalitions include cousins or even unrelated members. As cheetahs are among the weakest of the "top" African predators, yielding their kills to lions, leopards, hyenas, and even Cape Hunting Dogs and baboons, hunting in coalitions allows them to take down larger prey.

Very recently, in the first photographic evidence of its kind, game cameras in Siberia captured a male Amur tiger assisting the female in raising the cubs. Occasional reports of male Bengal tigers raising orphaned cubs, and there have been unauthenticated reports of male leopards staying with their cubs from the Congo as well. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2986109/Do-male-tigers-play-dad-Camera-trap-captures-rare-family-portrait-Amur-tiger-couple-three-cubs-wild.html?ITO=1490 ns_mchannel=rss ns_campaign=1490

<TEXT> I toyed with the idea of an oath for my Shepherds, but I'm undecided on whether or not to actually follow through. 

The Scriptures the Shepherds live by contain passages that can be interpreted as saying that oaths are not righteous (As I am incorporating a sort of Judeo-Christian worldview, the verses "Let your yes be yes and your no be no" come to mind, though I'm reading some interesting articles arguing otherwise at the moment)

In any case, in the event that I do decide to have an oath, it will be something like this:

*As surely as the Lord, God Creator, lives so I swear upon my soul this oath*

*With all my heart, I will serve the Monarch, Most High, with the strength of lions and the gentleness of lambs*

*With all my soul, I will hold the crook of the Shepherd, protecting the flock of the Lord, everything that is life.*

*With all my mind, I will learn, defending myself from evil, and defending the will of the Lord.*

*With all my strength, I will commit myself to the cause. I will protect the realms, until it is time for me to sleep.* 

*I will serve the Living Lord, God Creator, Monarch Most High, and Holiest Spirit* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, in the Bible, there's a few examples that can explain it.

The unnamed young man in the Gospel According to Luke, tells Jesus that he has kept the commandments all his life. Jesus says that this is good, but in order to gain eternal life, the man must sell all he has and give it to the poor. The young man walks away discouraged, for he has considerable wealth.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_and_the_rich_young_man

Susan does not want to make the sacrifices necessary. She likes material objects. And in both cases, the individuals meet Jesus/Aslan.

There's also the Parable of the Sower. The wheat (meaning Susan's faith) is planted, and cultivates, but is choked out by weeds (the ways of the world).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower

This one is pretty self-explanatory. Susan is caught up with "nylons and lipsticks and invitations" rather than the literally-everything-else, including Narnia.  </TEXT>

.....

In all seriousness though, by all means, read them and enjoy them just as much as you did as a kid.

C.S. Lewis said it best:

When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty, I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.

<TEXT> Thank you!

I never understood the confusion surrounding Susan's fate, given the foundation that had been set in the previous books.  

And I also think it's worth mentioning that C.S. Lewis did say that Susan could find her way back into Aslan's Country, "in her own time."

Considering this in the context of *Screwtape Letters,* where a demon tries to tempt a church-goer, I find it odd that people consider this Susan's final fate.

On that note, while a lot of people seem to like Neil Gaiman's short story "The Problem of Susan," which I find...bothersome. 

If anybody is interested in fan fiction for Susan that explores a different interpretation, you can't get much better than this:

<TEXT> If the story of Christ was boring, then what kind of ultimate truth is that? He knows that's not a knockdown argument for the existence of God. But he thinks if the Christian story was dull, that would be evidence against it, so it matters to him that it isn't. For the record, I think he's right... whatever else you think about the Bible, it's a pretty damn good story.

<TEXT> Oh, the crisis of faith/temptation in *Silver Chair* is one of my very favorite scenes in the entire saga.

(Context, the villain is using a spell that dulls the senses and try to convince the heroes that the city she has built far beneath the earth is the only world, and there is no Aslan. Puddlegump, a Marsh-wiggle [Sort of a frog-elf] objects)

"Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things  trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that's a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We're just babies making up a game, if you're right. But four babies playing a game can make a play-world which licks your real world hollow. That's why I'm going to stand by the play-world. I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it might help to put Susan into proper context:

Susan becomes a very vain and superficial person as an adult, and it was foreshadowed as far back as Prince Caspian, when she not only is the last of the children to see Aslan, she actively tells Lucy off for imagining things.

In Voyage of the Dawn Treader, she is allowed to go to America with her parents, because she "was the pretty one." She is also described as not being good at schoolwork, contrasting Peter, who is studying with Professor Kirke for examinations. Susan is being rewarded by the world, for the world's virtues. Virtues that are not necessarily in alignment with Aslan's.

In Last Battle, we learn that Susan is only interested in "invitations, nylons and lipsticks." She's a shallow young woman whose primary concern is social events. Compare this to Lucy, who loves Narnia most, or Jill, who has joined the British equivalent of the Girl Scouts, and is active in her community, directly because of her experiences in Narnia.

Most damningly, Susan laughs at the very idea of Narnia. She tells Eustace "fancy you still thinking about those games we played as children." </TEXT>

A few years back, there was a faith-based film called "To Save A Life," which focused on a teenager dealing with the aftermath of the suicide of a childhood friend. 

Now, I enjoyed "To Save A Life," but given that there has been a lot of criticism towards "13 Reasons Why," I wonder whether or not the film did more harm than good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Grimnoir Chronicles by Larry Correia.

Science fiction meets diesel punk meets noir meets superpowers.

The books are a heck of a lot of fun, but what makes it stand out to me most is the following exchange when the protagonist, a man with the power to manipulate gravity, is asked a question about President Roosevelt's plans for registration:

"FDR can go to hell. I'm a man. Not a type, not a number, and sure as hell not something that can be summed up as a logo to wear on my sleeve. A *man.* And I ain't registering *nothing.*" </TEXT>

Not necessarily. The Bible says not to cast your pearls before swine. It also says that believers may find themselves opposed to family members they love, but they must love God more.

But then, Lewis always had a very martial view of Christianity what with all the battles and killing. Didn't relate a lot to what Jesus preached.

Next to Billy Graham, I don't think there's a single person in the twentieth century who has done more for Christianity than C.S. Lewis.

(Also, I'd argue that the MCU's version of Captain America is not a liberal, at least in the current sense of the use of the word. He seems above mere politics, in pursuit of what's right. If I had to describe him as anything, I'd say constitutionalist)

<TEXT> So she lives her life in our world to the fullest--she was told outright she'd never get to be a queen in Narnia again. 

No. Susan lives life by the standards of the world. And the standards of the world are **not** the standards of Aslan. 

I'd agree with you assessment about Susan if the novel Prince Caspian didn't include that revelation from Aslan. She sort of had no choice but to give Narnia up.

It's a darned certainty that Aslan instructed her and Peter the same way that he instructed Edmund and Lucy later on, to take what they learned in Narnia and apply it to their home world. And to know Him by the name He has in their world.

Peter applied himself to his studies, while Susan shrugs off schoolwork as unimportant. 

Lucy and Jill apply what they learned in Narnia to their own lives--Jill joins the Scouts and takes up archery to be ready if the need ever comes again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That IS what happened. Thank you, SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY READ THE BOOKS!

To elaborate on your point:

Susan becomes a very vain and superficial person as an adult, and it was foreshadowed as far back as Prince Caspian, when she not only is the last of the children to see Aslan, she actively tells Lucy off for imagining things.

In Voyage of the Dawn Treader, she is allowed to go to America with her parents, because she "was the pretty one." She is also described as not being good at schoolwork, contrasting Peter, who is studying with Professor Kirke for examinations. Susan is being rewarded by the world, for the world's virtues. Virtues that are not necessarily in alignment with Aslan's.

In Last Battle, we learn that Susan is only interested in "invitations, nylons and lipsticks." She's a shallow young woman whose primary concern is social events. Compare this to Lucy, who loves Narnia most, or Jill, who has joined the British equivalent of the Girl Scouts, and is active in her community, directly because of her experiences in Narnia.

Most damningly, Susan laughs at the very idea of Narnia. She tells Eustace "fancy you still thinking about those games we played as children." </TEXT>

I also focus on characters that received some, but not a lot, of attention in canon. I find that more palpable than building something out of nothing in an existing universe. (How on earth did Daphne become so popular?)

On that note, I liked the stories that focus on the "Silver Trio" a lot:

<TEXT> "Nightmares of Future Past" is one of the original Peggy Sue stories, and as such, has some of the tropes that you've mentioned, though it does so in a relatively mild way [Dumbledore isn't evil at all, he's merely seeing Harry's actions as disturbingly similar to Tom Riddle's and conflict arises accordingly].

Seeing as it more or less started many of the tropes that make up a huge chunk of canon-deviant fan fiction (compared to Missing Moments like "Fire and Air"), it seems worth a mention.

<TEXT> Most people know that a "liger" is a hybrid cat, whose father was a lion and mother was a tigress. Ligers are huge, weighing up to a thousand pounds--this is due to their lack of a growth inhibitor, and posses both spots and stripes.

But other hybrids exist too.

"Tigons" are the offspring of a male tiger and a lioness. Unlike ligers, they do not grow to abnormally large sizes, and their coloration is considerably fainter.

"Leopons" are the offspring of male leopards and female lions. Considerably rarer than other hybrids, leptons have traits of both parents and there may be documented cases in the wild.

"Jaglions" are the offspring of male jaguars and female lions. These large cats possess the rosettes of the jaguar, and the tawny fur of a lioness. However, there does exist a melanistic jaglion, whose father was a black jaguar.

Ironically, it's actually a little dated now, given the most recent studies indicate that Eastern Wolves and Red Wolves are actually hybrids themselves, and not unique species. This in turn raises significant questions about the protections they're due under the Endangered Species Act.

<TEXT> If two creatures can create viable offspring, they are not necessarily considered the same species. What matters is whether or not the offspring themselves can produce viable offspring.

Mules and hinnies, the offspring of horses and donkeys, cannot produce their own young.

The different species of big cat can breed with each other, and produce offspring, and these offspring can produce their own young, but it is very rare, though not unheard of.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera_hybrid

Canis species on the other hand, are incredibly fertile. While gray wolves in western regions only seldom breed with coyotes, red wolves and eastern wolves will readily breed with coyotes, and the resulting hybrids can and will produce offspring.

The most recent studies actually indicate that most coyote populations east of the Mississippi River have large amounts of wolf DNA. 

And furthermore, domestic dogs are considered a subspecies of wolf. Their scientific name is *Canis lupus domestics.*

<TEXT> Ooh, that's a good question....I think it was back in eighth grade. 

I looked up "Bigfoot" on Wikipedia because I was bored. So that got me to thinking about cryptids in general.

And then in ninth grade I started watching *MonsterQuest* and I liked it. And I saw a special on Travel Channel about Mothman and the Jersey Devil.

I liked the idea of monsters and mysterious animals.

So that started the initial idea. 

A group of cryptozoologists knew the animals were real and fought against evil ones.
It kind of spiraled out of control... </TEXT>

***********
1a There are no video games whatsoever in *Terra Xira,* though the notion of sports is not completely alien to Minotaurs or Wolfmen.

1b Video games are essentially virtual simulations. Lots of first-person shooters, in historical veins, but with heavy doses of propaganda. 

1c No video games. No electricity at all. But there are lots of physical sports and games. 

2a  7,000 years

2b The world itself is quite old, but the Machine Empire only came to power a few decades ago. It just came hard.

2c Nobody's really sure, since people have had shipwrecks and vanishings at sea since forever, so nobody's bothered to do any studies of the sort. Not that they have the technology to carbon-date anything either, but still. 

3a
There are six continents on *Terra Xira.* The largest is about the size of North and South America combined as one landmass. There are two continents the size of Antartica, though neither of them is icy. All three of the races mentioned throughout this post live the largest continents. 

3b
There are three continents in the world, but the technology is so throughly advanced, and the world is so connected that the very idea is a moot point. 

3c
There are no continents in the World of Oceans. There are many islands pocketed throughout the Oceans, but none of them are particularly large (The very, very, largest is about the size of Iceland). Just about everyone lives on the ships, though there are a few small settlements on a few of the larger islands.

4a
As the Minotaurs are highly militaristic, pottery is seen as not the best medium of making memorials of the battles and tournaments fought. Murals and mosaics and even statues are far more common, and even then these forms of art are not nearly as common as grandiose speeches and whatnot.

There's not much in the way for pottery for Wolfmen, due to a general lack of available soils. Art is primarily in the form of carvings, from bone.

Centaurs use pottery as a form of art, occasionally in abstract.

4b
Historical relics in museums, but that's about it. Pottery and sculpture are not priorities in the schools in the Machine Empire's world.

4c
Not much in the way of clay pottery, due to its fragility, but there are carvings of sea glass, driftwood, and coral.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It all boils down to "What can they do with it? Will there be any New?"  for me.

*Jungle Book* has gorgeous special effects, (though I was surprised by how similar it was to *Jungle Book: Mowgli's Story* which was a BAD live-action film from the 1990s)

*Maleficent* for better or worse is a retelling from the villain's perspective. YMMV, but it's different. 

*Cinderella* fleshes out the Prince. And gives a little mantra for Cinderella--"Be courageous, and kind."

You get the idea. 

Aladdin's humor is absurd and cartoony, but I actually think a live-action film in the Disney style could be like watching *The Princess Bride.* A live-action cartoon Aladdin could be great.

The real question is why the heck they're doing a live-action/photo-realistic CGI *Lion King.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1a.
Minotaurs and Wolfmen have fur, rather than hair. Fur only grows to a certain length, and then stops. They don't particularly have need for barbers, though Minotaurs sometimes adorn their horns for ceremonies, or else take steps to prevent their bangs from obstructing their vision.

Centaurs sometimes shave their heads in their quest to meet enlightenment. Others let their hair grow out continuously.

1b. Strict haircuts are set in place by government-trained barbers. Heavily regulated. Standards firm--men's hair is not to go past the earlobe. Women's hair is to not go past the underarm.

1c. Several ships have barbers of sorts, with razors made from coral. 

2a. Different races have different court customs. 

The Minotaurs resemble military tribunes, with the highest ranked Minotaur in the region presiding. 

Wolfmen are judged by a council of five. 

Centaurs discuss as an intellectual group. Interclan disputes are settled by a third party.

2b. Mass surveillance and an immensely powerful state has rendered courts meaningless. Trials are a formality.

2c. Jury trials of a sort. Three judges deliberate and a group of ten sailors decides the fate of the accused.

3a. Minotaurs have fairly traditional prisons, with cells and schedules. 

Wolfmen are imprisoned in caves. For severe offenses, such as murder, the pack will move on without the imprisoned. 

Centaurs reject government, so their form of a prison is generally banishment.

3b. Horrible camps, where the imprisoned are subjected to physical and psychological torture.

3c. What's a ship without a brig? The accused stay below deck, at lower-rations. 

4a. The enforcers are among the most respected of the population, due to their long terms of service in the military prior to their joining of the force.

The swiftest and most nimble hunters track criminals (of which there are relatively few) and are generally respected by the community. The strength of the pack comes from the family. 

Centaurs have no police force to speak of.

4b. Desperately feared. Intensely hated. Even accidentally striking an officer is a terrifying offense. 

4c. Due to the extremely close living quarters, a standing police force is relatively unnecessary. However, piracy is despised and dealt with on an as-needed basis.

5a. As I have mentioned, there are many races within the boundaries of this world. Minotaurs and wolfmen and centaurs exist. There are also satyrs and fauns, dragon-men, golems, Sasquatch and others.

5b. Due to a very powerful government, selective genetic engineering has eliminated variances in ethnicity and dialect.

5c. As the population is comprised of the crews of ships that vanished without a trace, there is a wide range of ethnicities present. Dialects have become fairly ubiquitous as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have several worlds. I'll add as much as I can.

1a. 

In the lands of *Terra Xira* there are a number of nations, each with their own form of government: 

The Minotaurs follow something of a monarchy, with feats of strength being ways to advance their power. Challenges and alliances are freely made.

Lycoans run on families and packs, however the mothers are the heads of the household, and the packs (which are made of several families) are led by matriarchs. (This is a nod to real-world wolf packs, where it is often the alpha female who is the dominant member)

Centaurs recognize no form of government. They operate together based on schools of thought. 

1b. The Machine Empire [once again, I'm working on the name] is the fascistic government of the Metal Lands. 

1c. In the World of the Waters, there are loosely organized governments. As the population lives entirely on ships and a few islands, there is little that needs to be done beyond Survival. 

2. 

2a. Different beings travel differently, as one might expect.

Minotaurs march. Not particularly fast, but they can travel without sleep for two days without getting ill. Incredible stamina.

Lycoans travel as a family, in caravans, and then setting up their group dens for months at a time.

2b. How don't people travel around, would be a better question.

Bullet trains, pod carts (kind of like large hamster balls, but radio-controlled), fire-boosted gliders, airships, hovercraft, teleportation devices.

2c. Ships. The entire population lives on ships, so they swim and sail.

3. 

3a 

The most "developed" of the examples I'm listing here, the Minotaurs have a currency system based on precious metals

The wolfmen are very insular, and each job is directly connected to each other. 

As communal vagabonds, centaurs rarely have a need for traditional forms of currency.

3b Currency is extremely restricted, with daily rations being allotted per household.

3c Not really. There's definitely barter, but for the most part, the people aren't really established enough to justify the use of a currency system

4. Languages are a bit tricky for me. I am not J.R.R. Tolkien. So...everybody more or less speaks English

5. 

5a Yes

5b Yes

5c Yes

6. Seeing as each of these worlds is actually set in the same universe (and yes, they'll eventually meet each other), one could make the argument that they're all aliens to each other. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Certainly. 

Enjoy these facts on the lion.

**Lion** *Panthera leo*

Probably the most immediately recognizable of the big cats, lions live in the tropical grasslands of sub-Sahara Africa and in the Gir Forest of India, though they were once ranged throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere. Curiously, there are still occasional sightings of surviving American lions--but that's a discussion for another day. (To say nothing of the debate among paleontologists about whether *Panthera Atrox* was actually more closely related to jaguars)

Lions live in prides, ranging in number from four or five to upwards of twenty. The prides are led by a small group of adult males, while the remaining females are almost all related to one another. Male cubs leave the pride when they reach maturity, while females stay with the pride their entire lives.

Lionesses generally do most of the hunting, though when pursuing larger, more powerful game such as giraffe or cape buffalo, males will assist. Lionesses hunt by ambush; a few will charge the prey towards pre-positioned hunting mates. Lions primarily hunt ungulates--primarily zebra and various species of antelope, including impala and wildebeest. Yes, wildebeest are a species of antelope.

Lions are among the larger of the big cats, surpassed only in size by Bengal and Siberian tigers, with fully mature males weighing up to five hundred pounds. Due to their size, lions are apex predators--upon maturity, they will not be hunted for food by other carnivores and their presence is vital to healthy ecosystems. Females are considerably smaller, weighing up to three hundred pounds, though it's rare that a male exceeds four hundred pounds.

Lions are not terribly long-lived. Because males are driven from the pride upon reaching maturity (usually after about two years), they must fend for themselves. Littermates have a tendency to stick together, but lions have high infant mortality rates. When an outsider male lion challenges the pride's male, it is not unheard of for the fight to go to the death. Furthermore, if the outsider male in the victor, he will kill any cubs of the dominant male he just ousted.

Despite their reputation, lions are not the fiercest of Africa's predators. A lone male can be driven off by traditionally-armed Masai warriors. Lions have an antagonistic relationship with hyenas, with both species frequently stealing kills from one another. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember that episode. But it spiraled out of control (Of course, that's Law   Order for you).

One of the baby daddies was killed by an enraged relative of one of the teenaged mothers. 

The ringleader of the mothers was killed by her boyfriend (who was not actually the father) when he "tried" to quiet her down.

****
And it's entirely likely the show's done another one of the episodes.(Or perhaps one of Teen Mom) The one I described still had Stabler on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mind if I chime in? I love the big cats and have lots of random facts about them.

The term "panther" is generally thought to refer to black jaguars, or more traditionally black leopards. Bagheera from "The Jungle Book" is probably the best known black panther.

However, the term "panther" can be used to refer to any of the five species of cat in the genus Panthera. The lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, and jaguar are all "panthers" in this respect.

The five species are also commonly called "Big Cats," an informal classification which also includes cheetahs and cougars in popular vernacular. Clouded leopards are occasionally grouped in here as well. Independently of this, cougars are sometimes called "panthers."

"Panther" is a term most commonly associated with melanism.

Melanism is a genetic condition that leads to an abundance of pigmentation, and is the opposite of albinism. Albinism is the complete lack of pigmentation, and must not be confused with leucism (a lack of most pigmentation--except for melanin).

Classic example of melanism include the black leopard and black jaguar. There have been very few reports of black lions or black tigers, but as far as I know, they've never been confirmed. What have been confirmed are pseudo-melanistic tigers, which have a more heavily striped coat and are actually somewhat smaller than their normal cousins. Conversely, the golden tabby tiger has been observed. As the name suggests, it has no dark stripes. It should also be noted that while the pseudo-melanistic tiger has been observed in the wild, the golden tabby tiger is strictly a captive beast, having been bred accidentally from white tigers.

Outside of anecdotal reports, African lions do not appear to exhibit melanism. However, there is at least one, potentially, partially-melanistic individual that has a leg that is noticeably darker in color than the rest of its body.

Despite many sightings, there has never been an authenticated account of a pure black melanistic cougar.

That said, native tribes of Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and Spanish explorers, told of "Onza." Similar to the mountain lion in most respects, it was said to be slimmer and some specimens had pale brown stripes on their legs, and most intriguingly had non-retractable claws. It was also said to be ferocious, capable of taking down fully armored conquistadors in broad daylight.

A cat was shot in 1986 matching the description of the onza and was found to be a mountain lion. So, "onza" appears to be a sufficiently rare mutation of mountain lion.

For what it's worth, cheetahs are among the only members of the cat family that have non-retractable claws, and they are the species most closely related to mountain lions. Several cryptozoologists hypothesized that the onza had been a relic of the American cheetah, which lived during the Ice Age.

As previously mentioned, melanism is the opposite of albinism. While there have been a handful of albino individuals among the Panthera species, the White Tigers and White Lions are more well-known. White tigers and lions are not albinos. White lions have the aforementioned condition, leucism, though the genes of white tigers are a bit more complicated.

Most white tigers have chocolate brown stripes and blue eyes, compared to the red eyes characteristic of albino individuals. So-called "stripeless" white tigers have been reported, and this is likely due to inbreeding. And again, the genes that cause it are similar to, but not identical to, leucism.

White Lions have a broader range of color, appearing anywhere from blond to white.

Finally, there is the King Cheetah. Similar to the pseudo-melanistic tiger, King Cheetahs have a majestic coat that features bars and stripes as opposed to the polka dot pattern characteristic of cheetahs. When originally discovered, they were believed to be hybrids of leopards and cheetahs. Conversely, there exists a single known specimen of a spotless cheetah.

***********

While it is popularly assumed that only lions live in groups, this is not strictly true. While most cats are indeed solitary, male cheetahs have been seen to form small groups of two or three, occasionally more. Called coalitions, these groups tend to be made up of brothers of the same litter, but some coalitions include cousins or even unrelated members. As cheetahs are among the weakest of the "top" African predators, yielding their kills to lions, leopards, hyenas, and even Cape Hunting Dogs and baboons, hunting in coalitions allows them to take down larger prey.

Very recently, in the first photographic evidence of its kind, game cameras in Siberia captured a male Amur tiger assisting the female in raising the cubs. Occasional reports of male Bengal tigers raising orphaned cubs, and there have been unauthenticated reports of male leopards staying with their cubs from the Congo as well.

<TEXT> I think this is a fair question. I'm not quite as familiar with the Bible as I should be, but the general interpretation that I know is that the thief was genuine. 

Remember, Jesus was being crucified for being the Messiah, and if the thief was aware of the recent circumstances (the overturning of the tables in the Temple, the pardoning of Barbaras), he may have pieced together what might be happening.

This particular article is a good take on it:

http://www.jesus.org/death-and-resurrection/last-words/the-penitent-thief-a-model-of-true-repentance.html

And this one is a good writing on what to make of such scenarios in general.

<TEXT> Personally, I think my favorite is possible the story of the Penitent Thief. Quite appropriate given that it's Easter.

In the Gospel According to Luke, when Jesus is crucified, he is placed between two thieves. One thief mocks him, but the other declares that their punishment is just, while Jesus has done no wrong. He looks to Jesus and asks "Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've said it several times before, and I'll say it many more times again. 

When you raise the stakes too high, there cease to be stakes. Generally speaking, we know the good guys will win. The question is, how? And at what cost?

In regards to relatively small threats, Ant-Man does a good job. The bad guy is more or less an arms dealer, willing to take extremely dangerous technology and sell it to the highest bidder. The good guy doesn't have any particular personal involvement in the fight (at first--it's not until later that Scott's motivated to fight because his daughter's in danger, and also to avenge his pet bug) but falls into it more by chance. 

On the other hand, the Avengers had a world-enslaving invasion from aliens. Beating them was awesome, but what made it grand was the emotion behind it. Iron Man very nearly gave his life for the cause, and I don't think Tony thought he was coming back. Thor was desperate to get his brother back. And, as a whole, the Avengers came together.

Having said that, *Winter Soldier* and *Civil War* show this  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Original prompt: https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/645d6w/wp_the_glass_of_water_was_half_empty/

******************

Tall glass, three ice cubes, filled to the brim, no straw.

That was the exact way Lily liked to drink water. Cold and refreshing--and unlike a carton of ice cream, none of her little cousins she was babysitting would demand any. She could enjoy it all by herself.

Or at least, that's what was supposed to happen. 

There was a thumping upstairs. As if something was being moved...

"Henry!" Lily called. "Aunt Nadine isn't going to be happy that you aren't in bed! It's almost nine o'clock. Your bedtime was half an hour ago!"

There was no answer. Rolling her eyes, Lily walked upstairs. The hallway was dark, but there was light streaming out from one closed door.

Lily stomped over and yanked the door open. Her eight-year-old cousin, Henry, had dragged his toy chest across the room.

"Henry..."

"I saw that the Shadowman was going to get me. So I'm blocking the door so that he can't get me."

"Shadowman?"

"I closed my eyes and then there he was. He's this big evil monster dressed like a ninja. He's got teeth like a lion."

Lily felt her irritated expression soften. "Henry, you just had a bad dream. It's okay, I promise."

"But the Shadowman is big and tall and scary."

"He's not real, kiddo. I promise. And I'll keep you safe. If anything wants to get to you, he'll have to get through me." 

"Okay...."

"C'mon, let's get you back in bed."

Lily tucked the covers back around Henry and ruffled his hair, before turning out his light. 

Now that Henry was settled, Lily thought, as she walked back into the kitchen, she could enjoy her glass of water.

Her glass of water...it wasn't on the counter where she left it. It was on the edge, near the sink. And there was something else...

Lily walked on trembling legs over to the sink, her bare toes curling against the linoleum tiles. 

**The glass of water was half empty.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair, the reason why Spectacular Spider-Man ended how it did was because of the deal Disney made when they bought Marvel. Simply put, Spidey has separate television and film rights--Disney bought the television rights, but had to make only original stories. They couldn't continue the Sony-run Spectacular. 

Which is a damned shame, since Spectacular is one of the best animated stand-alone superhero series of all time (I'm not sure whether it's fair to bring up the DC Animated Universe here) </TEXT>

<TEXT> We met at college, freshman orientation. She was smart and funny and had dark brown hair and deep blue eyes. She didn't wear much make-up, but she always colored her fingernails and toenails with Magic Marker (She explained that it was much easier to clean that way).

She didn't like to party at all. Which was okay with me, since I didn't like the taste of alcohol (My parents let me have one glass of champagne at my cousin's wedding. Didn't care for it then). So we'd spend our Friday nights watching tv or going for walks on campus.

She was a business major, but she also loved reading and drawing. Just reading for fun and drawing for fun. When we would spend time together, sitting under a tree, she'd bring a book and read aloud.

I could never fail to make her laugh. She'd laugh at pretty anything, from dad jokes. She snorted when she laughed really hard. After she had had a bad day (getting a B- on her first test), I tickled her and she laughed so hard, she cried. Between her giggles, she said "thank you," and then she kissed me.

Our romance was short-lived, sadly, ending in October, about six weeks after we met. 

See, it turns out she was a Yankee fan, so I had to break up with her. Red Sox forever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Citadel [Once again, a bit of a place-holder name] is the headquarters/school/sanctuary of the Shepherds, a group of knights who took it upon themselves to protect the realms. 

The Citadel is first a castle--not unlike Hogwarts, or the Academ from *Codex Alera* by Jim Butcher, or even Bone Academy from *Children of the Red King.*

The consciousness-shifters act as gamekeepers, maintaining the castle, and making sure there are plenty of statues and suits of armor for their souls to take in the event of attack. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The consciousness-shifters, [I haven't decided on a proper name yet], are a race of humanoids that live throughout the realms, though their largest population resides on the greater grounds of the Citadel where the Shepherds live.

Consciousness-shifters posses the ability to leave their bodies behind, and take on the form of other existing objects. Suppose you were to leave your body behind to animate a statue or a suit of armor. 

More powerful consciousness-shifters, if they sit in close proximity to one another, can take on multiple objects and share the new bodies. 

Unlike golems, the consciousness-shifters are not limited to organic matter, and can even take over machines. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair, Legend of Korra was meant to only be a miniseries (With that in mind, the first season isn't that bad, if one considers it stand-alone)

Season 2 was an abomination, with one shining gem of a two-parter. Though "Beginnings" does raise plenty of questions of its own, related to the nature of the Avatar in general. I'm fairly certain the writers originally said that the "Avatar spirit" was the "spirit of the world" which allows for moral grayness. Ravaa and Vaatu made it good-versus-evil/order-versus-chaos.

But I also recognize that the writing crew for "LoK" didn't have their best writer. Aaron Ehasz didn't return. </TEXT>

In the "Infancy Gospel of Thomas," Jesus kills several other children, and blinds their parents.

<TEXT> He's likely referring to the Gnostic gospels, a collection of works that emerged starting around the middle of the second century A.D. or later. (For context, the canonical gospels were written between 60 and 90 A.D. or so. Several of the letters attributed to St. Paul are dated between 50 and 60 A.D.)

The Gnostic gospels include "Secret Gospel of Mark" and "Gospel of Thomas" and "Gospel of Judas." They included some stories of the early life of Jesus, and the depiction is less than flattering. 

They were thoroughly discredited by the early Christian Church and  condemned as heretical. </TEXT>

That's something to that I think. One thing I noticed in Rogue One is that the two main characters in particular are rather unnecessary to the plot. Jin's father already had that one defecting pilot bring the secret information to the rebels. 

And I definitely agree that about the "fuck yeah" moment. Force Awakens may have been a bit paint-by-numbers, but darn it if the actors playing Fin and Poe weren't having the time of their lives doing it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great - but: Would you guys really want to be lumped in with all the crazy?

I'm not an atheist but I am familiar with the phenomenon. These "atheist churches" sprouted up because the members missed the aspect of community. Or the music. Or the organization. 
And some atheists attend Unitarian-Universalist services, which emphasize social justice. 

I mean all religious people are IMHO delusional (loved the book "The God Delusion" - Thanks Mr. Dawkins!)

I. Am. Not. Delusional. Have you ever actually discussed religion or spirituality outside of the Internet? 

You bring up Dawkins? Have you ever read the works of atheists who found faith? C.S. Lewis? Lee Strobel?

hell, by starting an "Atheist Church" you kind of go down to the fucking level of SCIENTOLOGY (that fucking sect started by a fifth rated (if not worse!) science fiction author should IMHO be forbidden!), I just don't know if that's worth it!

I am insulted on behalf of all atheists for that statement. And Ron L. Hubbard is one of the best science fiction writers of the twentieth century. If you think he's "fifth rate," than I am genuinely curious to see what masters of wordsmithing you consider to be good.

ps: Germany is great this way, we have a lot of atheists here (former East-Germany (the disbanded German Democratic Republic!) had a lot of non-believers because they tried to get people away from church during the cold war (when that part of Germany was under socialist/communist "management")) 

You do realize that the Soviets had a habit of slaughtering priests and other religious figures? They had a god, and it was the State. That's not exactly something to get excited about.

so we kind of have a voice in parliament (sure the believers often manage to drown us out (in certain instances they really pile on the pressure and muslims stand with jews and christians against us non-believers...strange right?)

If by "voice in Parliament" you mean advocating for complete secularization of society. I haven't forgotten that Germany outlawed home-schooling, and threatened Christian parents with arrest.  

Also, the inter-religious conflicts of the Abrahamic religions is far more complicated than what your statements imply. And I don't know where you get your sources, but in the West, Christians and observant Jews have been getting along recently--to use your juvenile terms, we like each other.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why bigoted? 

Not so much in your original post, but scrolling down you mention your complete disdain for religion, snidely referring to it as akin to having "imaginary friends."

That's bigotry, that is. 

I want her to seek treatment for what I see as some grief left over from seeing her mother die and some delusions from her dad who raised her as best he could but actually needs treatment himself?

We have no notion that Luna didn't get some sort of treatment. She's clearly far more at peace with the idea of death, and the possibility of an afterlife, than anyone else in the canon, except perhaps Dumbledore or Nicholas Flamel. 

There is nothing to indicate that Luna suffers from delusions, which are neurological in order. Conspiracy theorist and amateur cryptozoologist she may be, but the fact of the matter is she is **not** delusional. 

At only a very few points in the canon do we actually see that Luna is factually wrong about the various conspiracies. [Sirius is not a musician. The Rotfang Conspiracy is most likely bogus. Fudge is not baking goblins into pies {though I wouldn't be surprised if he's killed a couple; we know he was trying to steal away control of the banks).

And similarly, Xenophilius does not appear to suffer from delusions either. </TEXT>

Cap didn't die until after Civil War was over though, and to be fair to Tony, he was distraught over it.

I don't get it about comic book writers either. The comics are written with a very...authoritarian bent (They came out and said that Tony was meant to be the good guy in Civil War. And that's not even factoring into the even worse Civil War 2, which had the side that advocated imprisoning people before crimes were committed).

Contrast that to the extremely popular Captain America films that some have argued possess a libertarian world view. </TEXT>

In a world with Billywigs [tiny electric blue wasps that cause people to float when they're stung], those two are remarkably plausible). Luna is not delusional.

There's no indication that Xenophilius is delusional or deranged either.

<TEXT> Sometimes I think that Civil War gets a bit of a harsh deal. That said, I only read the original seven issues (all in one volume).

The instigation/prologue/whatever-you-want-to-call-it isn't bad at all by any means. It makes sense that collateral damage would eventually lead to public outcry. We've seen it before in our own world many times.

And some of the side stories are great. Peter's defection to Cap's side. Hank Pym being sick with remorse over what's happened. The role of the Punisher.

And Hercules, he was awesome! Just plain awesome! When is he getting a MCU movie?

But there's also a lot that really, really, really sucks. 

Richards and Tony go on and on about how "the public wants this to happen." They say public wants, I say mob rule.

And that ending--okay, so the Constitution means squat, Captain AMERICA?! So long as the public gets what they want?

Vernon's a bigger arse than before? It's all but stated there's Someone Else trying to pull strings.

Snape's a villainous villain from Villain-ville? It's pre-DH, the fandom was split down the middle on Snape's allegiance.

Malfoy? The kid could pull off Serpentsorsia as a second-year. 

Politics? The most we really see outside the custody hearing is that one party at Longbottom Manor. And it's more a bunch of stuffy old people being stuffy and Neville barely escaping being bored out of his skull.

If PBS were to lose its federal funding (and that's a mighty big IF), most of the children's shows would be just fine.

Sesame Street (which now airs its newest episodes on HBO) and Arthur have lots of merchandise--picture books and plush toys and video games. Arthur would be able to adjust and find a new distributor.

What would be at risk if PBS were to lose federal funding are the regional shows that are allotted the aforementioned funds in the first place.

What would be at risk if PBS were to lose federal funding are the regional shows that are allotted the aforementioned funds in the first place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's wrong with the focus on DW? 

D.W. is, to put it frankly, an obnoxious, self-important, spoiled brat, badly in need of discipline. 

She lies and throws tantrums without anything remotely resembling remorse, and she is far more prone to Aesop Amnesia. 

As a pre-schooler, her episodes are far more limited in their scope than the elementary-aged Arthur and his friends.

It's good to have more female representation and primary protagonists on shows for little girls who may not be able to easily relate to Arthur.

Did I ever say it wasn't? Female representation means squat when the character is horrible. Little girls deserve far better than D.W. to watch on television. </TEXT>

A lot of the earlier episodes felt a bit more timeless), it still manages to hold its own among other children's television, especially on PBS. </TEXT>

One episode, "MacFrensky" is a re-telling of Shakespeare's *Macbeth.*

While Arthur has gone downhill in the last few years, for various reasons--a bit too much kid slang ("besties" ugh), not nearly enough focus on Arthur, WAY too much focus on D.W. and her friends, the show maintains its nearly unparalleled ability to handle mature issues for children.

Remember how they dealt with the issue of divorce with Buster?

<TEXT> The Grimnoir Chronicles could be superb.

Picture this:

It's the 1930s, and for the last eighty years, people have had magic. Some have super strength, some pyrokinesis, some have rapid intelligence, etc.

Called "Magicals," or, for the more powerful, "Actives," America remains in the Great Depression while Japan has fully embraced magical powers is run by a mysterious man called the Chairman.

A man named Jake Sullivan is a private eye, a decorated war veteran, and an ex-con. After making a deal with J. Edgar Hoover, Sullivan tracks down magical crooks. On a case, he finds himself facing Deliah Jones, an old...friend. And a conspiracy that involves both the Chairman, and a group of magic users that call themselves the Grimnoir Society.

They're my all time favorite novels. There's airships and Tesla weapons, samurai and knights, ninjas and gangsters. John Moses Browning and General Black Jack Pershing.  </TEXT>

Good grief. Just good grief. I've seen good men get falsely accused of racism before, and let me tell you, it sucks. 

This reminds me of the Sad Puppies (a relatively loosely organized band of science fiction writers of every race and creed), and the subsequent outrage and false accusations of racism against them and some of their followers. 

Thanks for the history of Walt Disney, I wasn't aware of that.

You're welcome.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dang it, that was it?! That was it?! 

There's nothing that makes me angrier than phony outrage and false accusations. People condemn PewDiePie for that?! When there are others who have said far worse things and gotten off scot-free?!

Rowling should be ashamed of herself for jumping on the bandwagon like that! How many times did she get falsely accused of encouraging witchcraft or turning kids against Christianity, when her books are actually some of the most Christian-themed in modern fantasy literature. 

As an aside, one religious science fiction writer I know of said that *Deathly Hallows* may as well be subtitled: *The Passion of the Potter.*

Thanks for the video, I'm happy to know the context, though I did notice one glaring error in the video--Walt Disney was not a racist, nor was he anti-semitic. 

Per Wikipedia: 

Disney has been accused of anti-semitism,[193][z] although none of his employeesincluding the animator Art Babbitt, who disliked Disney intenselyever accused him of making anti-semitic slurs or taunts.[195] The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons.[aa] Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities, he was named "1955 Man of the Year" by the B'nai B'rith chapter in Beverly Hills,[196][197] and his studio employed a number of Jews, some of whom were in influential positions.[198][ab] Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concludes that the available evidence did not support accusations of anti-semitism and that Disney was "not [anti-semitic] in the conventional sense that we think of someone as being an anti-Semite". Gabler concludes that "though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not anti-Semitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-Semitic [meaning the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals], and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life".[199] Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s.[200]

Disney has also been accused of racism because some of his productions released between the 1930s and 1950s contain racially insensitive material.[201][ac] The feature film Song of the South was criticized by contemporary film critics, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and others for its perpetuation of black stereotypes,[202] but Disney later campaigned successfully for an Honorary Academy Award for its star, James Baskett, the first black actor so honored.[203][ad] Gabler argues that "Walt Disney was no racist. He never, either publicly or privately, made disparaging remarks about blacks or asserted white superiority. Like most white Americans of his generation, however, he was racially insensitive."[201] Floyd Norman, the studio's first black animator who worked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, said, "Not once did I observe a hint of the racist behavior Walt Disney was often accused of after his death. His treatment of peopleand by this I mean all peoplecan only be called exemplary."[204] </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is how I feel as well. Which is why I have not bothered to read any pottermore, any other extended universe. I simply do not care. The original Harry Potter books were written from the heart, JK Rowlings baby. She was nobody before those books, and they came from the heart. She Harry came from misfortune and she fully understood that more than most writers because of her own misfortunes.

Though I don't believe I reach the full level of dislike for expanded universes that you do, I do find myself leery of them often. But I do think you have a point about Rowling. There's a level of earnestness in the books that simply isn't present elsewhere.  

I like it when authors start out by writing what they know. (If you ever want to read urban fantasy, I highly recommend the Monster Hunter International series. It's about a group of mercenaries that hunt werewolves, zombies and vampires for a living. It's written by a firearms expert).

I truly do not give one flying fuck about the egotistical, drama seeking person JK Rowling is now. Providing dumb extended universe arbitration. I could feel the passion in JK's writing.

I do think that there are some elements that are good about the Expanded Universe. For example, she did give an explanation for why Fenrir Greyback bit Remus Lupin. It was alluded to in the books, but never actually stated. But other elements seem...unnecessary. 

 It is gone now, because she was fully okay turning her art into a product.

I can understand the sentiment. My favorite comic script of all time is Calvin and Hobbes, and the creator flat-out refused to let there be much merchandise behind it. (Besides the book collections, there's a couple of rare calendars and a short study guide).

I will always love the original books. The 7 books.
I will never go onto Pottermore. I will never read the extended universe. I will never take buzzfeed quizzes to see which house I am in, or which character I am.

So will I. I love the original Harry Potter books, and the original movies. And I will buy new copies of the books.

It is the story about Harry Potter, it's not my story. I know people become so obsessed with the fandom they have to include themselves in the art. It's not my art, or my story.

I take it you don't read much in the way of fan fiction then?

I certainly have my issues with the fandom in general as well. I can't exactly condemn the people who draw themselves as Hogwarts students, but I do dislike some elements of fan art. Or rather, the common elements of fan art that are not canon, but a lot of fans treat as canon. </TEXT>

And due to her profile, she gets a lot more attention than may be appropriate.

And, regardless of views, Twitter sucks for political commentary in general. </TEXT>

However, I feel that other films left out more important information. 

PoA left out some of the most important scenes from the book--the feud with Hermione is diluted, and the scenes in the Shrieking Shack are cut short. A not-insignificant subplot is the implied comparisons made between the friendships of the Marauders, and that of the "Golden Trio." 

Similarly, the adaptation of Half-Blood Prince left out a lot of material on the Horcruxes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mind if I chime in? I love the big cats and have lots of random facts about them.

The term "panther" is generally thought to refer to black jaguars, or more traditionally black leopards. Bagheera from "The Jungle Book" is probably the best known black panther.

However, the term "panther" can be used to refer to any of the five species of cat in the genus Panthera. The lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, and jaguar are all "panthers" in this respect.

The five species are also commonly called "Big Cats," an informal classification which also includes cheetahs and cougars in popular vernacular. Clouded leopards are occasionally grouped in here as well. Independently of this, cougars are sometimes called "panthers."

"Panther" is a term most commonly associated with melanism.

Melanism is a genetic condition that leads to an abundance of pigmentation, and is the opposite of albinism. Albinism is the complete lack of pigmentation, and must not be confused with leucism (a lack of most pigmentation--except for melanin).

Classic example of melanism include the black leopard and black jaguar. There have been very few reports of black lions or black tigers, but as far as I know, they've never been confirmed. What have been confirmed are pseudo-melanistic tigers, which have a more heavily striped coat and are actually somewhat smaller than their normal cousins. Conversely, the golden tabby tiger has been observed. As the name suggests, it has no dark stripes. It should also be noted that while the pseudo-melanistic tiger has been observed in the wild, the golden tabby tiger is strictly a captive beast, having been bred accidentally from white tigers.

Outside of anecdotal reports, African lions do not appear to exhibit melanism. However, there is at least one, potentially, partially-melanistic individual that has a leg that is noticeably darker in color than the rest of its body.

Despite **many** sightings, there has never been an authenticated account of a pure black melanistic cougar.

That said, native tribes of Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and Spanish explorers, told of "Onza." Similar to the mountain lion in most respects, it was said to be slimmer and some specimens had pale brown stripes on their legs, and most intriguingly had non-retractable claws. It was also said to be ferocious, capable of taking down fully armored conquistadors in broad daylight.

A cat was shot in 1986 matching the description of the onza and was found to be a mountain lion. So, "onza" appears to be a sufficiently rare mutation of mountain lion.

For what it's worth, cheetahs are among the only members of the cat family that have non-retractable claws, and they are the species most closely related to mountain lions. Several cryptozoologists hypothesized that the onza had been a relic of the American cheetah, which lived during the Ice Age.

As previously mentioned, melanism is the opposite of albinism. While there have been a handful of albino individuals among the Panthera species, the White Tigers and White Lions are more well-known. White tigers and lions are not albinos. White lions have the aforementioned condition, leucism, though the genes of white tigers are a bit more complicated.

Most white tigers have chocolate brown stripes and blue eyes, compared to the red eyes characteristic of albino individuals. So-called "stripeless" white tigers have been reported, and this is likely due to inbreeding. And again, the genes that cause it are similar to, but not identical to, leucism.

White Lions have a broader range of color, appearing anywhere from blond to white.

Finally, there is the King Cheetah. Similar to the pseudo-melanistic tiger, King Cheetahs have a majestic coat that features bars and stripes as opposed to the polka dot pattern characteristic of cheetahs.
When originally discovered, they were believed to be hybrids of leopards and cheetahs. Conversely, there exists a single known specimen of a spotless cheetah.
**********
While it is popularly assumed that only lions live in groups, this is not strictly true. While most cats are indeed solitary, male cheetahs have been seen to form small groups of two or three, occasionally more. Called coalitions, these groups tend to be made up of brothers of the same litter, but some coalitions include cousins or even unrelated members. As cheetahs are among the weakest of the "top" African predators, yielding their kills to lions, leopards, hyenas, and even Cape Hunting Dogs and baboons, hunting in coalitions allows them to take down larger prey.

Very recently, in the first photographic evidence of its kind, game cameras in Siberia captured a male Amur tiger assisting the female in raising the cubs. Occasional reports of male Bengal tigers raising orphaned cubs, and there have been unauthenticated reports of male leopards staying with their cubs from the Congo as well.

Hindsight is 20/20, they probably were expecting people to keep wanting to go into stores to buy things.

<TEXT> Speaking for myself, I always found "My Old Lady" to be among the saddest episodes.

Specifically, I always found Turk's patient, the young man not a day over twenty, saddest.

JD's patient was a little old lady, who as you said is happy. She's lived her life, and by all accounts, it was one hell of a life.
Elliot's patient is sad, but we spend very little time with her. It's hard to get attached.

But Turk's patient is just a kid, and we do spend a lot of time with him, and we do get attached and it's pretty clear that he's terrified. He's young and he has his whole life ahead of him, but he's sick, and he doesn't know what happens next. You can really see this right when Turk starts to reach out to him.

The worst part is when they wheel him into surgery. He's smiling. This kid is stricken with cancer but he's smiling. He is smiling because his doctor is his friend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In addition to this, it was Passover, so Jews from all over the Roman Empire were traveling to Judea for the ceremonies.

Because of this influx of many additional travelers, the money changers were able to cheat the Jews gathered for Passover, by exchanging extremely unfair rates. They also were selling animals for temple sacrifices--essentially saying that you had to pay money in order to be forgiven.

<TEXT> I think u/okmvfr is referring to James Garfield actually surviving for eleven weeks following the assassination. 

One of the bullets was lodged in Garfield's side, and doctors used dirty, unsterilized tools to attempt to find it (Not that they managed to find it; they were actually looking on the wrong side). Infections from the botched attempts to remove the bullet, combined with malnutrition brought on by Garfield's severely limited diet, contributed significantly to Garfield's death.

Many historians and doctors now hypothesize that had Garfield gotten proper medical attention with more capable doctors, he likely would have survived the assassination attempt.

The assassin, on the other hand, was put on trial in November of that year, in one of the first prominent cases involving an insanity defense. He was eventually sentenced to death in January, and executed by hanging in June 1882. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, my favorite Young Adult fiction author is Caroline Cooney. She's best-known for the *Face on the Milk Carton* books, but personally, my favorite is *A Friend At Midnight.* You want realistic teenagers? *A Friend At Midnight* is top-notch in that regard.

To me, I think the popularity in YA fiction is a mere advancement of the books about primary school aged children.

To clarify, the books we read in elementary school were often books about children our age. The cast of *Sideways Stories from Wayside School* are, what fourth graders? Encyclopedia Brown is ten. Harriet the Spy was in the sixth grade. Henry Huggins was eight in his first book, and twelve when his stories ended.

By comparison, a lot of the classics we read in high school were most certainly not about teenagers.

Now books about teenagers have existed for decades (Sweet Valley High comes most readily to mind), I think there was still a bit of a vacuum. Combine this vacuum with our desire to read about heroes, and the increasingly large number of Young Adult fiction makes sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A mixture of reasons.

Keep in mind, it's been quite some time since I saw the films.

**Shrek**

The first Shrek is a bit of a spoof on fairy tale movies. It plays with, while still maintaining many of their tropes. 

There's an ogre? He's not kidnapping anyone or destroying crops or livestock. He's not out to hurt anyone, he just wants to be let to his own devices.

There's a talking animal? It talks. That's it. There's no curse on it, it didn't use to be a human. It never shuts up. It's not a wise sage--though he does have some advice on when it comes to treating people  decent.

There's a quest to save the princess? The prince doesn't feel like doing it himself. He'll send a knight. But all the knights get beaten up? Okay, he'll send the one who beat them up.

You get the idea. But Shrek also holds true to some morals that are not completely unfamiliar to what you'd see in Disney fairy tales. "It's what's on the inside that counts" sounds very much like a lesson Disney would endorse (Beauty and the Beast, for one).
*****

**Shrek 2**

If the original film was a spoof on classic fairy tale ideas, then the sequel is a spoof on Disney itself. All the fairy tales are apparently real, and it's a whole world.

There's new environments--Far Far Away is a much larger city than the gimmicky Duluth. In a way, it's like the writers were making fun of themselves as much as Disney. They don't pull punches against anyone. A lot more jokes are made, many of them at Hollywood's expense in general. The award ceremonies, the gazillion Starbuck coffee shops, etc.

Shrek 2 also introduces characters that were quite new at the time. Puss in Boots is a trained assassin, but also steadfastly loyal to Shrek for sparing his life. A mercenary who has honor. 

Prince Charming is reminiscent of Gaston, but bratty and prone to tantrums. 

And the Fairy Godmother is brilliant. The best villains think themselves the heroes, and that is certainly true here.

And the themes are nice. 

While the first film was built on Shrek and Fiona overcoming their own personal insecurities, and falling in love, the sequel is focused on the idea of family. When you marry someone, you marry their family. And although Shrek loves Fiona, and he knows Fiona loves him back, the world still doesn't.

The overall theme of Shrek 2 appears to be not so much "it's on the inside that counts," but "you must value who you are, and who others are." It's not so much "Be Yourself," but "Be Your Best Self." Shrek may be an ogre, but that doesn't mean that he can't be friendly with his in-laws. 

Donkey and Puss are total opposites, but they can still be best friends, if the end of the film is any indication

King Harold has spent his entire adult life putting on a show, hiding his true nature, because he was ashamed. But in his actions with the Fairy Godmother, he became a very unpleasant person, that he himself dislikes. It is in his last act as a human, that he shows the best humanity, in his attempted Heroic Sacrifice to protect his daughter and son-in-law. He is reverted back to a frog, but Queen Lillian tells him that this is the best he's been in years.
******
Shrek the Third has none of that. 

The humor is a lot more crude--Dreamworks has a well-deserved reputation for crass humor and slapstick but there was a conspicuous lack of wit in Shrek 3 that had been present in the previous films.

The new characters are boring at best, and flat-out annoying at worst.

And the climax was supposed to be fantastic--Shrek is willing to sacrifice himself to save Prince Arthur, in front of all the villains of all the fairy tales.

But there wasn't any decent build up. Shrek and Arthur have very little rapport. 

Worst of all is the very boring moral. Arthur gives a little speech to the bad guys and it feels like an After School Special, and that's because it IS an After School Special. Arthur the High School Student tells all the bad guys that they can be anything they want and then that's IT. </TEXT>

These mecha--they can't be too large. My main heroes have melee weapons and small firearms. I can't let them get too overshadowed.

Not blades that were on fire, not blades of pure plasma, but swords of actual fire. Or metallic weapons that could switch their state of matter (solid, liquid, gas). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like slice-of-life fics, especially those featuring Ginny and Luna's friendship. But keeping it platonic. Let some of Luna's Luna-ness rub off on Ginny. 

Ideas? It may be nice to see more of Remus as a teacher--not many fics focus on him during Prisoner of Azkaban, but don't have him pine over Sirius. How would he interact with McGonagall or Snape or Hagrid? Imagine his reaction if he overhears students bullying another (who may or may not be Luna)?

Plot points? I'd like to see more Harry-and-Dudley-reconciliation fics. Or where Krum stays behind at Hogwarts and joins the Order of the Phoenix.

Funny scene that I want to see? I'd like to have seen Sirius and Snape get into a fight. A Muggle duel where they pull hair and bite and kick and Sirius mentions that Snape has to get over the ghost of Lily.

Other funny scenes? Zacharias Smith getting beaten up in various ways would be nice. </TEXT>

Could part of it be how old we were when we saw it? Or what was going on in the world when it happened?

I was in college when Winter Soldier came out. My political leanings were shifting--Cap's ideals of right and wrong, combined with his resolve to stand against corruption and consolidation of power, was something I was experiencing first hand.

******

Maybe the trick is to see Evans in his other projects--he's got a new movie due out in just a few weeks.

If we get used to Evans as Not-Captain America, maybe that'll help seeing Not-Evans as Captain America. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I was just saying in another comment - my enjoyment of the MCU is so deeply tied to Chris Evans' depiction of Cap. When he leaves, it's going to be really hard for me to get as excited for future MCU stuff.

There's Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie. Assuming that Bucky and Falcon survive the Infinity War, one of them is bound to take up the mantle and be Captain. YMMV on Comic Captain Falcon, but if Mackie's improvement in *Civil War* over his already excellent role in *Winter Soldier* is a glimpse of things to come, I'm delighted.

I'm also keeping my fingers crossed for Falcon to appear in Black Panther.

Also, Black Panther. Black Panther is something to get excited about. He damn near stole the show back in *Civil War.*

I had high hopes for Spidey, but I'm really growing weary of RDJ's Tony Stark. I hope Spidey can succeed without a heavy dose of Iron Man.

Personally, I've long thought that Spidey is best suited for a Netflix series. Preferably one that takes a lot of influence from the animated *Spectacular Spider-Man.*

That said, I'm looking forward to the movie. Tom Holland did a great job.

As for Stark, I'm still fond of him, and since I barely knew of RDJ, I still like his interpretation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A perfect example of this, from *Winter Soldier,* concerns that one computer technician. His name is Cameron Klein.

Brock Rumlow and the rest of S.T.R.I.K.E. have guns pointed at him, demanding he release the codes. But he remembers Captain Rogers giving his little speech about how *the cost of freedom is high, but it's a price I'm willing to pay.*

The only person that Klein could take in a fight is pre-Serum Rogers. He knows that Rumlow could trounce him. He knows he'll get his brains blown out if he doesn't do what H.Y.D.R.A wants. But he still takes a stand.

What makes Captain America truly special is that he is able to make others take a stand as well.

Edit: I stand corrected. The name of the computer technician is Cameron Klein. </TEXT>

In 2004, a Gallup survey 38% of Americans either owned guns or lived with someone who did. In the most recent survey (I think it was 2015), it was indicated that only 32% did.

Now, some have speculated that some of the respondents might not have been truthful, but that's speculation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> another one got suspended for bring a pink bubble "gun" to class too.

I remember that story. The little girl didn't actually bring her bubble gun to school. 

She was waiting in line at the school bus and told one of her little friends that when they got home, they could play with it. If memory serves, she said something along the lines of "I'll shoot you, you'll shoot me, and we'll all have fun."

I think the bus monitor reported her. </TEXT>

"Dead Beat" is probably my favorite of all the Dresden books, and Butters is a huge reason why.

Just the scenes where Butters steps up--when he puts himself in front of Cassius to protect Harry, even though he has no fighting prowess, when he plays the polka drum to resurrect Sue, when he tells Harry "I'm not afraid to die fighting beside you."

Butters is the best ever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mind if I chime in? I love the big cats and have lots of random facts about them.

The term "panther" is generally thought to refer to black jaguars, or more traditionally black leopards. Bagheera from "The Jungle Book" is probably the best known black panther.

However, the term "panther" can be used to refer to any of the five species of cat in the genus Panthera. The lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, and jaguar are all "panthers" in this respect.

The five species are also commonly called "Big Cats," an informal classification which also includes cheetahs and cougars in popular vernacular. Clouded leopards are occasionally grouped in here as well. Independently of this, cougars are sometimes called "panthers."

"Panther" is a term most commonly associated with melanism. 

Melanism is a genetic condition that leads to an abundance of pigmentation, and is the opposite of albinism. Albinism is the complete lack of pigmentation, and must not be confused with leucism (a lack of most pigmentation--except for melanin).

Classic example of melanism include the black leopard and black jaguar. There have been very few reports of black lions or black tigers, but as far as I know, they've never been confirmed. What have been confirmed are pseudo-melanistic tigers, which have a more heavily striped coat and are actually somewhat smaller than their normal cousins. Conversely, the golden tabby tiger has been observed. As the name suggests, it has no dark stripes. It should also be noted that while the pseudo-melanistic tiger has been observed in the wild, the golden tabby tiger is strictly a captive beast, having been bred accidentally from white tigers.

Despite many sightings, there has never been an authenticated account of a pure black melanistic cougar.

That said, native tribes of Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and Spanish explorers, told of "Onza." Similar to the mountain lion in most respects, it was said to be slimmer and some specimens had pale brown stripes on their legs, and most intriguingly had non-retractable claws. It was also said to be ferocious, capable of taking down fully armored conquistadors in broad daylight.

A cat was shot in 1986 matching the description of the onza and was found to be a mountain lion. So, "onza" appears to be a sufficiently rare mutation of mountain lion.

For what it's worth, cheetahs are among the only members of the cat family that have non-retractable claws, and they are the species most closely related to mountain lions. Several cryptozoologists hypothesized that the onza had been a relic of the American cheetah, which lived during the Ice Age.

As previously mentioned, melanism is the opposite of albinism. While there have been a handful of albino individuals among the Panthera species, the White Tigers and White Lions are more well-known. White tigers and lions are not albinos. White lions have the aforementioned condition, leucism, though the genes of white tigers are a bit more complicated.

Most white tigers have chocolate brown stripes and blue eyes, compared to the red eyes characteristic of albino individuals. So-called "stripeless" white tigers have been reported, and this is likely due to inbreeding. And again, the genes that cause it are similar to, but not identical to, leucism.

White Lions have a broader range of color, appearing anywhere from blond to white.

Finally, there is the King Cheetah. Similar to the pseudo-melanistic tiger, King Cheetahs have a majestic coat that features bars and stripes as opposed to the polka dot pattern characteristic of cheetahs.

When originally discovered, they were believed to be hybrids of leopards and cheetahs. Conversely, there exists a single known specimen of a spotless cheetah.

*****

While it is popularly assumed that only lions live in groups, this is not strictly true. While most cats are indeed solitary, male cheetahs have been seen to form small groups of two or three, occasionally more. Called coalitions, these groups tend to be made up of brothers of the same litter, but some coalitions include cousins or even unrelated members. As cheetahs are among the weakest of the "top" African predators, yielding their kills to lions, leopards, hyenas, and even Cape Hunting Dogs and baboons, hunting in coalitions allows them to take down larger prey.

Very recently, in the first photographic evidence of its kind, game cameras in Siberia captured a male Amur tiger assisting the female in raising the cubs. Occasional reports of male Bengal tigers raising orphaned cubs, and there have been unauthenticated reports of male leopards staying with their cubs from the Congo as well.

<TEXT> I can understand your point. If the point of a comedy is to make people laugh, then it should also make sure that we're laughing for the right reasons.

Ideally, we need to be laughing *with,* not laughing *at.*

On that note, general silliness is a plus.

As a fan of Boy Meets World, I laugh hardest at Big Brother Eric's general silly goof-ups. Same logic applies with Kyle (We still don't know his last name) on Last Man Standing.

Now, there's definitely room for an "asshole" in a comedy. Take Scrubs--Dr. Cox is often very funny, especially when he yells at JD. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In North America, for the last four hundred years, eyewitnesses, both indigenous and European, reported seeing huge cats that were much larger than mountain lions. Sometimes, these reports told of cats that were jet black in color. Other times, cats resembling the lions of Africa and India were reported--and this was long before circuses.

Loren Coleman documented dozens of sightings in his book *Mysterious America.* He hypothesizes co-relation between the black panther sightings, and the rarer lion sightings.

Complicating matters is the forensic evidence indicating that *Panthera Atrox* was more closely related to jaguars.

For what it's worth, in South America and West Africa, there are reports of surviving, *saber-toothed* cats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have subscribed to Cat Facts. Please enjoy these facts about the African Lion:

**Lion** *Panthera leo*

Probably the most immediately recognizable of the big cats, lions live in the tropical grasslands of sub-Sahara Africa and in the Gir Forest of India, though they were once ranged throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere. Curiously, there are still occasional sightings of surviving American lions--but that's a discussion for another day.

Lions live in prides, ranging in number from four or five to upwards of twenty. The prides are led by a small group of adult males, while the remaining females are almost all related to one another. Male cubs leave the pride when they reach maturity, while females stay with the pride their entire lives.

Lionesses generally do most of the hunting, though when pursuing larger, more powerful game such as giraffe or cape buffalo, males will assist. Lionesses hunt by ambush; a few will charge the prey towards pre-positioned hunting mates. Lions primarily hunt ungulates--primarily zebra and various species of antelope, including impala and wildebeest. Yes, wildebeest are a species of antelope.

Lions are among the larger of the big cats, surpassed only in size by Bengal and Siberian tigers, with fully mature males weighing up to five hundred pounds. Due to their size, lions are apex predators--upon maturity, they will not be hunted for food by other carnivores and their presence is vital to healthy ecosystems. Females are considerably smaller, weighing up to three hundred pounds, though it's rare that a male exceeds four hundred pounds.

Lions are not terribly long-lived. Because males are driven from the pride upon reaching maturity (usually after about two years), they must fend for themselves. Littermates have a tendency to stick together, but lions have high infant mortality rates. When an outsider male lion challenges the pride's male, it is not unheard of for the fight to go to the death. Furthermore, if the outsider male in the victor, he will kill any cubs of the dominant male he just ousted.

Despite their reputation, lions are not the fiercest of Africa's predators. A lone male can be driven off by traditionally-armed Masai warriors. Lions have an antagonistic relationship with hyenas, with both species frequently stealing kills from one another. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mind if I chime in? I love the big cats and have lots of random facts about them.

The term "panther" is generally thought to refer to black jaguars, or more traditionally black leopards. Bagheera from "The Jungle Book" is probably the best known black panther.

However, the term "panther" can be used to refer to any of the five species of cat in the genus Panthera. The lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, and jaguar are all "panthers" in this respect.

The five species are also commonly called "Big Cats," an informal classification which also includes cheetahs and cougars in popular vernacular. Clouded leopards are occasionally grouped in here as well.
Independently of this, cougars are sometimes called "panthers."

"Panther" is a term most commonly associated with melanism. Melanism is a genetic condition that leads to an abundance of pigmentation, and is the opposite of albinism. Albinism is the complete lack of pigmentation, and must not be confused with leucism (a lack of most pigmentation--except for melanin).

Classic example of melanism include the black leopard and black jaguar. There have been very few reports of black lions or black tigers, but as far as I know, they've never been confirmed. What have been confirmed are pseudo-melanistic tigers, which have a more heavily striped coat and are actually somewhat smaller than their normal cousins. 
Conversely, the golden tabby tiger has been observed. 
As the name suggests, it has no dark stripes. It should also be noted that while the pseudo-melanistic tiger has been observed in the wild, the golden tabby tiger is strictly a captive beast, having been bred accidentally from white tigers.

Despite many sightings, there has never been an authenticated account of a pure black melanistic cougar.

That said, native tribes of Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and Spanish explorers, told of "Onza." Similar to the mountain lion in most respects, it was said to be slimmer and some specimens had pale brown stripes on their legs, and most intriguingly had non-retractable claws. It was also said to be ferocious, capable of taking down fully armored conquistadors in broad daylight.

A cat was shot in 1986 matching the description of the onza and was found to be a mountain lion. So, "onza" appears to be a sufficiently rare mutation of mountain lion.

For what it's worth, cheetahs are among the only members of the cat family that have non-retractable claws, and they are the species most closely related to mountain lions. Several cryptozoologists hypothesized that the onza had been a relic of the American cheetah, which lived during the Ice Age.

As previously mentioned, melanism is the opposite of albinism. While there have been a handful of albino individuals among the Panthera species, the White Tigers and White Lions are more well-known. White tigers and lions are not albinos. White lions have the aforementioned condition, leucism, though the genes of white tigers are a bit more complicated.

Most white tigers have chocolate brown stripes and blue eyes, compared to the red eyes characteristic of albino individuals. So-called "stripeless" white tigers have been reported, and this is likely due to inbreeding. And again, the genes that cause it are similar to, but not identical to, leucism.

White Lions have a broader range of color, appearing anywhere from blond to white.

Finally, there is the King Cheetah. Similar to the pseudo-melanistic tiger, King Cheetahs have a majestic coat that features bars and stripes as opposed to the polka dot pattern characteristic of cheetahs. 

When originally discovered, they were believed to be hybrids of leopards and cheetahs. Conversely, there exists a single known specimen of a spotless cheetah.

**********

While it is popularly assumed that only lions live in groups, this is not strictly true. While most cats are indeed solitary, male cheetahs have been seen to form small groups of two or three, occasionally more. Called coalitions, these groups tend to be made up of brothers of the same litter, but some coalitions include cousins or even unrelated members. As cheetahs are among the weakest of the "top" African predators, yielding their kills to lions, leopards, hyenas, and even Cape Hunting Dogs and baboons, hunting in coalitions allows them to take down larger prey.

Very recently, in the first photographic evidence of its kind, game cameras in Siberia captured a male Amur tiger assisting the female in raising the cubs. Occasional reports of male Bengal tigers raising orphaned cubs, and there have been unauthenticated reports of male leopards staying with their cubs from the Congo as well.

<TEXT> EPICAC is definitely up there. 

A supercomputer used for warfare, turned sentient, befriends one of its handlers. 

The handler is in love with his coworker and describes her love of poetry. 

The computer, EPICAC, writes love poems, and eventually falls in love with the female handler himself. 

The workers have fallen in love are engaged to be married. EPICAC confronts the worker who turned him sentient (it's a very specific setting of the switches and buttons). The worker responds that he and the woman are made of protoplasm and will live forever, while EPICAC is a mere machine that can break. When told that he is a machine, and thus can never be loved by a human, EPICAC responds "Oh."

The next morning, there are pages and pages and pages of code. EPICAC has short-circuited himself and fried his hardware beyond repair. At the end of the pages is a short note, EPICAC has decided that he does not want to only be used for war, but acknowledges that he can never know peace or love. He asks the worker to take care of the woman they both love, and as one final gift, has written them enough love poems to use as anniversary presents for five **centuries.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, that's a good point. There were other things wrong with the Civil War storyline. (Goliath's death was shocking and sudden, and given that I don't usually read comics and knew very little about him, I'm actually impressed how moved I was). I have to remember that I only read the seven main comics, so I missed a lot of action off-screen.

Linkara gave a decent overview:

http://atopthefourthwall.com/15-things-wrong-with-marvels-civil-war-comic/

For me, maybe it wasn't so much the set-up in itself, but how. I hated that fascist Mariam Sharpe was seen as a driving force.

"Thanks for supporting my big idea about superhero registration, Tony Stark! Isn't robbing innocent people of their rights totally neat-o?"

Her uneducated tantrums got hundreds of people rounded up--even people who had no interest in fighting crime--and she saw it as a net good. And worse, the way she phrased it. "Big idea." It's almost as if she saw a police state as akin to an after-school arts-and-crafts program to get excited for. </TEXT>

You have to use the Ray Sphere (a thingamabob that will wipe out the radiation that is plaguing humanity and causing superpowers to emerge). The game tells you to press all four shoulder buttons. And then it says to let go.

<TEXT> But I also think that the movies and shows are doing a pretty good job establishing that while many people are fans of the superheroes, there's also a lot of people that are as afraid of them as they would be of mutants. Like the fallout after Age of Ultron when an entire city was literally raised into the air and completely destroyed. There's definitely people that are pissed and/or terrified of the Avengers among other super-powered beings.

Excellent point. And say what you will about the MCU being repetitive, they have done a good job in establishing the fear that some people feel of the heroes. I **loathe** beyond words the set-up of "Civil War" in the comics, but I understood the points made in the movie, even if I was firmly on Cap's side.

<TEXT> Well, every situation is different, so these rules are general, but still useful. But be aware that things might go down differently.

Did something sudden happen? Is someone having a heart attack? Did someone just collapse? A car accident?

First, ask one person specifically to call nine-one-one. This will dilute the bystander effect. If you scream at random for someone to call an ambulance, then people may get confused. 

If someone is unconscious, lay them on their back, but avoid moving the neck, if possible. 
Get their mouth open to prevent them choking on their vomit.

Water is refreshing, and a cleanser, and can be useful in treating bleeding, but if someone has fallen,

#DO NOT TRY TO POUR SOME WATER IN AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON'S MOUTH! THIS IS A **VERY** BAD IDEA

If giving CPR, then just do the pumps to the chest, and do it to the timing of "Stayin' Alive." It sounds ridiculous, but it actually is an excellent time.

If someone cut themselves on something, then you need to apply pressure, or make a tourniquet. If the person who is bleeding is conscious, then ask them for their help in applying pressure. 

For some more basic tips, that I must stress are BASIC TIPS, I recommend Mayo Clinic.

<TEXT> Part of it is likely how the powers are got. 

Lots of superheroes get their powers through accidents--Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider, Daredevil got splashed with ooze when he was a boy, the Fantastic Four get their powers through gamma rays, etc. 

One of the first superheroes in the Marvel timeline was Captain America. He got his superpowers through a government program. He was a Super Soldier. So he's really cool. A lot of heroes got their powers through attempts to make more Captain Americas.

And then there's who they fight--Spidey and Daredevil and Luke Cage fight thugs and crooks and thieves. Even if they don't admit it, lots of people sorta secretly like vigilantes and like the idea of smacking bad guys around. So the guys with powers are fighting bad guys.

And Captain America was a war hero. Can't do better than that.

Mutants are born with their powers. Some of them, like Beast, don't even look like humans. They're not just wearing costumes. So they're scary and different. 

And mutants (except Wolverine) tend to fight other mutants. Xavier's students versus Magneto's cult of fanatic killers. 

Regular people can't really tell the difference between the two groups.

And their powers are a lot more destructive--Cyclops or Iceman could easily destroy thousands of people, to say nothing of what Magneto or Charles Xavier could do. 

[Not that the public ever knew what really happened, but there's horrific precedent. Once, in the Ultimate Universe, a mutant teenager actually killed half his town by accident, and Wolverine had to kill him. It's one of the saddest stories in comics ever. http://imgur.com/gallery/I71V6](#spoiler)

So, the gist of it is that mutants are freaks that fight each other while other superheroes are people, behind masks so they could be anybody, who fight bad guys.

Edit: Wrong link in the spoiler. Sorry guys, I was discussing Spider-Man earlier. </TEXT>

If the funding for PBS is pulled (and that's a mighty big IF), then the children's media, including Sesame Street, will be just fine. People all over the country love them and buy their merchandise.

The term "panther" is generally thought to refer to black jaguars, or more traditionally black leopards. Bagheera from "The Jungle Book" is probably the best known black panther.

However, the term "panther" can be used to refer to any of the five species of cat in the genus Panthera. The lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, and jaguar are all "panthers" in this respect.

The five species are also commonly called "Big Cats," an informal classification which also includes cheetahs and cougars in popular vernacular. Clouded leopards are occasionally grouped in here as well. 

Independently of this, cougars are sometimes called "panthers." 

"Panther" is a term most commonly associated with melanism.
Melanism is a genetic condition that leads to an abundance of pigmentation, and is the opposite of albinism. Albinism is the complete lack of pigmentation, and must not be confused with leucism (a lack of most pigmentation--except for melanin).

Classic example of melanism include the black leopard and black jaguar. There have been very few reports of black lions or black tigers, but as far as I know, they've never been confirmed. What have been confirmed are pseudo-melanistic tigers, which have a more heavily striped coat. Conversely, the golden tabby tiger has been observed. As the name suggests, it has no dark stripes.
It should also be noted that while the pseudo-melanistic tiger has been observed in the wild, the golden tabby tiger is strictly a captive beast, having been bred accidentally from white tigers.

Despite many sightings, there has never been an authenticated account of a pure black melanistic cougar.

That said, native tribes of Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and Spanish explorers, told of "Onza." Similar to the mountain lion in most respects, it was said to be slimmer and some specimens had pale brown stripes on their legs, and most intriguingly had non-retractable claws. It was also said to be ferocious, capable of taking down fully armored conquistadors in broad daylight.

A cat was shot in 1986 matching the description of the onza and was found to be a mountain lion. So, "onza" appears to be a sufficiently rare mutation of mountain lion.

For what it's worth, cheetahs are among the only members of the cat family that have non-retractable claws, and they are the species most closely related to mountain lions. Several cryptozoologists hypothesized that the onza had been a relic of the American cheetah, which lived during the Ice Age.

As previously mentioned, melanism is the opposite of albinism. While there have been a handful of albino individuals among the Panthera species, the White Tigers and White Lions are more well-known. White tigers and lions are not albinos. White lions have the aforementioned condition, leucism, though the genes of white tigers are a bit more complicated.

Most white tigers have chocolate brown stripes and blue eyes, compared to the red eyes characteristic of albino individuals. So-called "stripeless" white tigers have been reported, and this is likely due to inbreeding. And again, the genes that cause it are similar to, but not identical to, leucism.

White Lions have a broader range of color, appearing anywhere from blond to white.

Finally, there is the King Cheetah. Similar to the pseudo-melanistic tiger, King Cheetahs have a majestic coat that features bars and stripes as opposed to the polka dot pattern characteristic of cheetahs. When originally discovered, they were believed to be hybrids of leopards and cheetahs. Conversely, there exists a single known specimen of a spotless cheetah.

****

While it is popularly assumed that only lions live in groups, this is not strictly true. While most cats are indeed solitary, male cheetahs have been seen to form small groups of two or three, occasionally more. Called coalitions, these groups tend to be made up of brothers of the same litter, but some coalitions include cousins or even unrelated members. As cheetahs are among the weakest of the "top" African predators, yielding their kills to lions, leopards, hyenas, and even Cape Hunting Dogs and baboons, hunting in coalitions allows them to take down larger prey.

Very recently, in the first photographic evidence of its kind, game cameras in Siberia captured a male Amur tiger assisting the female in raising the cubs. Occasional reports of male Bengal tigers raising orphaned cubs, and there have been unauthenticated reports of male leopards staying with their cubs from the Congo as well.

<TEXT> They grabbed me when I came back from checking the mail, and the first thing they did was tie my scarf around my eyes to use as a blindfold. 

I yelled and kicked and punched--one of them was wearing a sweatshirt and another was wearing flannel.

I could hear three voices...but they were speaking in a language I did not understand. Gibberish it sounded like. 

I was dragged away, my sneakers scraping against the asphalt of my family's driveway. Their grip was like iron, pressing into my arms. 

I hear the door to my house being opened. 

The one holding my left arm asked a question in that gibberish I don't understand. His voice is squeaky and then deeper and then squeaky again. A voice from above me answers but of course I can't understand it.

I'm lowered to the ground--my head bonks against the linoleum of the kitchen floor--and then my legs are lifted up. I try to protest, but my captors ignore me. I'm being dragged again, and I register the carpeting of the family room. The voices are arguing--though it doesn't sound overly combative.

I'm being dragged downstairs, my head scraping against the stairs, into my family's basement. It's much cooler here and it smells musty. And what little light I could register through the scarf is even more muted.

I'm forced to sit in a wooden chair. The three murmur to one another, still in that gibberish. Why can't they speak English?

*Skriitch* 

The sound of tearing? No, not quite tearing. At least not clothes. More like tape.... 

"Mmmmmph!"

The duct tape is pressed against my mouth, and then smaller pieces are placed on either end.

"Mmmmph!"

Something thin and scratching is wrapped around one of my wrists, and then my arm is yanked behind me. I struggle but my wrists are tied behind me. It's not particularly tight--the dress shoes I wear to church pinch more, truth be told--but the knots are tied in places my fingers can't reach.

I try to kick out but my foot is caught. There's some more gibberish and my sneakers are pulled off. And then my socks. The cement floor of the basement is freezing against my bare feet and then another rope is tied around my knees. It isn't tight either, but the knots is out of reach.

I'm completely trapped. And my nose itches.

I hear the sounds of shuffling and then I hear the television being turned on. And then the Playstation. And then the sounds of lasers and spaceships and explosions. And more yelling in gibberish.

And that's the story of how my brothers took me prisoner to stop me from tattling when they played some stupid Star Trek video game for six hours when they were supposed to be doing chores. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On birds:

You can have raptors--birds of prey. Eagles and hawks and falcons.

Seabirds: Pelicans and albatross and cormorants

Songbirds: Self-explanatory

Flightless birds: Ostriches have been bred for meat and people race them (yes really). The now extinct Moa was even larger.

Don't be afraid to diversify. Historically, falcons were raised by man to hunt. But what if, in addition to this, they were bred for color? Imagine falcons in vibrant shades of red and gold and blue.
*****
On cows:

Cattle are actually part of the bovid family, and this includes bison, water buffalo, cows, and sheep and goats.

But let's focus on cows, for the moment. Or at least, cows and other bovids that are large enough to squish humans.

Cattle are a fair bit more diverse than a lot of people realize. Just in America, you've got your Holsteins (the classic black and white), Texas Longhorns, Jersey cows, and more.

Cattle have occasionally been bred with bison, leading to hybrids called "beefalo." 

Bison are huge, mighty beasts. And then buffalo in Africa and water buffalo in India are similarly large.

And then there's yaks and muskox.
*****
Bears.

Well, what kinds of bears are we talking about? There are eight species of bear: the brown (includes grizzlies and Kodiaks) bear, the polar bear, the American black bear, the Asiatic black bear, the spectacled bear, the sloth bear, the sun bear, and the giant panda.

You could go a more mystical route here. There are many Native legends about the Kermode bear and glacier bear, which are American black bears with white and blue coats respectively. 
***
Dinosaurs. 

Okay, the first dinosaur that came to mind was an ankylosaurus.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosaurus#/media/File:Ankylosaurus_magniventris_reconstruction.png

Call them "club-tails" or maybe "stone-backs." They could pull plows or maybe be used in military conflicts.

And though they're not technically dinosaurs, could plesiosaurs be used? They could be beasts of the ocean that your peoples have a semi-friendship with, not unlike man's relationship with dolphins.
****
Reptiles

Can't overlook turtles or crocodilians. Or monitor lizards like the Komodo dragon--though if you're sticking with dinosaurs, then I recommend Megalania. Think a Komodo dragon that was thirty feet long. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lots of Biblical, specifically Old Testament, history repeats itself in similar ways. Floods happen, a reverse tower of Babel, leading to the diaspora of most life. God always favors the humans specifically in my world, though there aren't any real non-human followers.

Personally, I drew some inspiration from the Judges in developing my heroes, though those ideas are largely on the back burner now.

There's a constant battle between gods and I have the Abrahamic God as the good guy, though his followers arent always too good. The world is constantly undersiege by demonic forces and physical manifestations of sin, so there's definite "evil" I guess.

There's nothing wrong with this. Some of the greatest heroes from the Bible were deeply flawed human beings. King David for one.

If you're curious, I base the justification of having other gods exist in my interpretation of "thou shalt not worship any other god before me" (paraphrased) to be admittance that other Gods exist; but you must solely place your faith in him.

I've given this some thought too, actually. Occasionally. The prophet Elijah confronted the prophets of Ba'al, after all. 

So you say these Shepherds had crusades and priests, Im assuming there was no precursor? No jewish-esque faith?

I should have clarified. The Shepherds are an off-shoot of the Crusaders from 1000 A.D. (I'll need to read up on the Crusades to get the specifics). They were one temple over from the knights that formed the Templars, and instead of treasure, they found a gateway to another world.

So the reason there wasn't much of a Jewish-esque faith is that Christians got there first, so to speak. Other people have travelled to the various realms throughout history, but the first people who were deliberately sent to the other world were these knights. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So are your Gods real?

In my world, only one God is real. Though many pagan idols exist.

Is there only one religion that's right?

The religion of the Shepherds is right--though there are some denominational differences. And there are many false religions. 

Are there multiple?

No, there is only one God. Though my villains fancy themselves gods. 

Is there one God that is misinterpreted as many?

No, though this does remind me a fair bit of "Tashlan" from *The Last Battle.* 

Furthermore, are they interventionists or do they keep to themselves?

The God of the Shepherds is loving and intervening in the lives of His followers. But it's often through the use of prophets. 

Are they like the [A]brahamic God or like the ancient Greek gods?

The God of the Shepherds *is* the Abrahamic God. The first knights who went on to form the Shepherds were participants in the Crusades. They set up a few tiny sanctuaries in the realms they were sworn to protect. And there were also a few chapels already existing.

Consider this: there are werewolf priests that can give communion to Minotaurs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ooh, I've been waiting for something like this question.

My world started forming ten years ago. It was more or less Narnia--a forested world connected to ours by gateways. Denizens of the fantasy world included dragons and elves. Creatures that could travel between them were cryptids--Sasquatch, onza, shunka warakin, Loch Ness Monsters. Defending the gateways were a group I called the International League of Christian Cryptozoologists. (The name sucked, I know). I eventually renamed the ILCC the Cryptid Templar.

Ninth grade, I pushed myself (and my brother hogged the video games) and lo and behold, I was able to finish a rough draft, 39,500 words long. 

That was nine years ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They sat side by side, the boy and the girl.

His head in his arms, his knees to his chest, he stared down the bank.

She sprawled on the grass giggling, her bare toes amid the dandelions wiggling.

He was lost in thought; her head was in the clouds.

And they were happy.
****
His name was Samuel. His t-shirt stuck to the back of his neck, but the shade of the tree prevented discomfort. His bicycle, his transportation to anywhere his heart desired lay to the side. This place was where he desired to be. Samuel turned to his companion, and smiled. 

Her name was Elizabeth. Her arms, browned from the sun, stretched up, tucked behind her head, nestled under dark tresses. Her dress shoes lay discarded; blades of grass brushed against and tickled her bare feet. Elizabeth shifted her gaze to Samuel.
****
To stay here forever, that would be nice. Samuel liked being with Elizabeth. She was a dreamer, and always hoping to find the good. Sun beams peeked through the branches of the shady tree they sat under and kissed Elizabeth's arms.

Simplicity was blissful, mused Elizabeth. She liked sitting with Samuel. Sometimes they talked about things, things like the future, and sometimes she held his hand when he was upset. And sometimes, they just sat like this. Under the shade of a tree, while the brook flowed downstream.
****
Love is often considered the most complex of all emotions. We do things that we cannot explain for those we love. But this wasn't the case with the love Samuel and Elizabeth had.

It was uncomplicated. It was simple. It was good. It was right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This makes some sense. The Cap trilogy is over (and it was an extremely solid offering), and now we're going into the Infinity War. 

Cap, more than any other established A-List Avenger in the MCU, has the opportunity to pass the torch. 

Bucky is enhanced with a Soviet-Serum, and has been shown to be adept at using Cap's shield himself. And Sam Wilson, the Falcon, is steadfastly loyal and holds near-identical views on liberty and righteousness to Steve Rogers. Either one of them would be an excellent candidate to be the new Captain America.

Also, with respect to the Infinity War, there is a classic scene where Captain America stares down Thanos, the Mad Titan.

So, here's Fire and Air:

https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11152139/1/Fire-and-Air

And here's Dinner With the Weasleys--a fic I describe as the Sunday dinner you eat at your grandparents' after church. Most impressive about this one? Luna's point of view, first person, and it *works.*

https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7227719/1/Dinner-With-the-Weasleys

You can never have too much Luna. Here's one of the best Luna-fics of them all. *Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection.*

http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023 chapno=1

Finally, if you're looking for an AU story that will not scare her off...then the only one I can recommend is Stages of Hope.

<TEXT> Not sure, but I guess, objectively speaking, it should have been a given. Jack was how old exactly when the Big Three were born? 32? That puts him being born in 1948? That's old enough for serving in Vietnam, and given his earlier occupations, it's apparent he didn't go to college. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The evil villain's secret lair was at the top of the very tall mountain. Of course, it wasn't exactly secret--the lair doubled as the house the villain, Evileenee von Villaineay, lived in with her daughter. (The real estate agent said it was a great deal, prime real estate. In reality, the Evileenee, whose real name is Rose Friar, didn't want to pay taxes on two dwellings)

There were advantages to having the evil lair in your home. It was much easier to transport all the devices, for one thing. And you could fire the ice ray at pedestrians and prepare your freezer for winter at the same time. But it did have the distinct disadvantage of the good guys being able to look you up in the phone book...

*****

"Freeze evil-doers! I, Hero McHeroMan, will stop you! And I--Hannah, honey, can you keep up? The bad guys will get away if you don't hurry."

"Ah haa, huuu haaaa...sorry....huhhh....Daddy."

Two masked figures glared at each other; one dressed in reds and golds, the other dressed entirely in black. Behind the red-and-gold champion, a small, thirteen-year-old girl, wearing jeans and hiking boots, was doubled over, panting.

"Freeze?! *Freeze?!* Good grief, Hero McHeroMan, you are losing your touch. That lame pun is the best you can do?!"

"Daddy...huff hufff...can't help it if he's...running out of ideas. There hasn't...been a new Dresden book in two years."

"Is this your new sidekick, McHeroMan? You should return it to the academy, it's defective."

"You fiend! All life is sacred! And there exists no human being is defective! Hannah, my Staff of Superness!"

"Uh...that's the one with the white spiral right?"

"What? No, that's the Righteousness Rod. The Staff has the yellow ball at the end, there's a good girl."

"You are too late, Hero McHeroMan! Nothing can stop me now!" She pointed towards a very large and shiny machine. "My new Robot--inator is creating me an army of powerful, cyborg-otic servants. They bend completely to my will. Maahaa-haa!"

"No! It is never too late for justice to stop the forces of evil!"

Hero McHeroMan waved his Righteousness Rod and smashed it against the Robot--inator. Despite the Righteous Rod being made of wood, and the Robot--inator being made of metal, the giant machine smashed into pieces.

"Aaaahh...that was expensive!"

"Surrender, evil-doer!"

"Daddy, can you slow down so that I can take notes?" Hannah smiled at her father. "Please? It's for school."

"Robots! Seize Hero McHeroMan and his brat!"

Six dozen robot drones of various sizes and abilities charged towards Hero McHeroMan and Hannah. Because Hero McHeroMan is a hero, he was able to smash many robots to pieces. However, he did not smash them all and several were able to catch Hannah, who had no fighting abilities whatsoever.

"Hannah! What happened to your martial arts training?!" Hero McHeroMan was grappling with a very tall robot with hook arms, as three robots wrapped Hannah from head to foot in ropes, taking her captive.

"I tried! But the walk up here hurt my legs. I probably have blisters the size of--hey!" The robots tied Hannah's ankles to a crane and it hoisted her into the air upside down. "All the blood is rushing to my head!"

"Didn't I tell you not to wear those new boots? You just bought those at that mall last week."

"But Daddddddddyyyyyy. They're so cute and pink and cute."

"Quiet captive! There is no escape! Your mindless shopping has led to your capture and now Hero McHeroMan, surrender or I will destroy your daughter!"

"You cannot win! Your machine is smashed, and most of your robots are destroyed."

"I can so win! I can have my machine repaired! Machinist!" Evileenee snapped her fingers. "Come and repair my machine. And bring in the other Inator! The Ice-inator!"

A short figure wearing a welding mask walked over, "Coming Mom. What hero are you fighting this time? Oh, hi Hero McHeroMan!"

"The Machinist?! What are you doing here?!"

"Fixing machines...and what the? Hannah, what are you doing up there?"

"Hi, Monica."

"You're Hero McHeroMan's daughter?!"

"Yeah."

"Wait, Monica?! You spent the night last Friday!"

"Yes, I had a very nice time, Mr. McHeroMan. Thank you again for having me. You look sick Hannah, let me get you down from there."

"WHAT?! No! Bad Monica, bad! That girl is my prisoner! Do not, do *not* untie her!"

"She's my best friend, Momma. Hannah, you alright?"

"Fine. A little dizzy, but I think I actually got worse during the hike up here."

"What? That's ten miles from your house!"

"I know! But Daddy says long hikes build character!"

"Easy for him to say, he has super speed and is friction proof!"

"I know, and he and your mom are too busy fighting for me to take notes for school!"

"What? You actually bought what Billy said about that? This "Take-Your-Daughter-To-Work-Day is just an excuse for the teachers to get an early start on summer vacation. There's no essay to write."

"What? Really? How do you know?"

"Hannah, summer starts on Monday."

"Oh...oh yeah."

"Never mind that, come on upstairs. The home theater is right above Mom's lair! It makes watching movies great!" Monica pulled up her mask and began pointing at various robots. "You, come with us and make us a pizza. You, set up the vanity and give us both pedicures. You, start the popcorn. You, you, you and you, come on, I'll think of other things to do."

Giggling, Monica and Hannah, and most of the remaining robots left the lair. When they got to the elevator, Hannah turned around and smiled.

"Can I sleep over, Daddy. Pleeeeeaaaaassseee?"

"Well, I...um...I...er...."

"Pretty please?"

"Well...okay."

"Thank you, thank you, thank you!"

Evileenee glared at Hero McHeroMan. "Pushover."

"And yet, evil-doer, all of your evil devices are destroyed. Do you surrender now?"

"Just get out of here, Clarence. This is going to take forever to clean, since you broke my home maintenance robot." </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can somebody please explain why there doesn't appear to be verification of melanism in mountain lions? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-22 20:36:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am aware that many species exhibit a phenomenon called melanism, which is essentially the opposite effect of albinism, and then this can be an explanation for assorted "mysterious creatures." I also know that in the world of the Big Cats, "black panthers" are melanistic leopards and jaguars. There have been many sightings of so-called "black panthers" in the United States and Canada, but to my knowledge, there has never been a verified melanistic mountain lion.
Is there some genetic reason for this? Are some creatures just pre-disposed not to exhibit melanism or albinism? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys. A while back, I was reading a thread that theorized what would have happened had Cassius Warrington been drawn as the Hogwarts Champion in lieu of Cedric Diggory. The thread elaborated potential side effects of this one change and I found it compelling.

And I also read a thread once that theorized a storyline in which Aunt Petunia takes Harry under her wing from the very beginning, and I found it equally compelling.

So, to clarify my question, what plot element would you change that could sway the tide of events in the series and what would those effects be? </TEXT>
