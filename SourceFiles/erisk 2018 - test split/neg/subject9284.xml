<TEXT> Why is this still important today?

Because WaPo and the MSN is trying to push the narrative that Weiner's laptop, was overstated and that Comey is the fall guy for said over statement.

You can read Devlin Barrett's hit piece here:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/comey-misstated-key-clinton-email-evidence-at-hearing-say-people-close-to-investigation/2017/05/09/074c1c7e-34bd-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html

(Sorry for the long annoying link, thanks WaPo!)

Notice the source 'says people close to investigation'.

Sooooo what would Comey have done with those other 13 devices?  Is it really Comey's fault that unethical Hitleray lost the election?  

Or was it that the American people had more respect for leaders who hand over their devices when subpoena'd because you have nothing to hide to begin with?  

Or maybe we were fed up w leaders who wipe private email servers and then claim no comprehension of the difference between classified information and non-classified information?

Maybe selling 19% of the US's Uranium reserves TO RUSSIA in exchange for $250,000,000 donation to YOUR FOUNDATION is a reason to vote for Trump instead, hmmm?

What would your devices e-footprint have said about those 'deals'?  

Stop blaming Comey.  As MJ once said 'start w the man in the mirror'. Hillary lost because of Hillary.

Keep positive Mr Comey!  And please help keep us safe from threats to the US, both foreign and domestic :-)

And even then you're really far.  Also the concrete weight load might not be sufficient, or elevators need a complete overhaul to handle emergency exits etc.  

It's extremely difficult to 'just add 20,000 seats'.  The shitters might even overflow if the sewers can't handle the extra load.

<TEXT> Let's be clear about this-

The Hillary / Obama team is the group that ILLEGALLY unmasked non-relevant people for the sake of hoping to discredit them, who later on Obama thought might be part of Trump's team.

It goes like this:

Person A is Russian, and the Deep State is tapping every line of communication they have going on, 24 7.

Person A talks to 1,000's of people in a year.  Sometimes just to say 'here is idea A I have to sell you product xyz' that goes nowhere.

Some of those 1,000's of people were possible Trump team members.  The Deep State blacklines those 1,000's of people who are not relevant.

What Obama ordered his team to do was un-blackline and un-redact ONLY the potential Trump team members SOLEY to paint them in 'looks who's talking to Russia!' fabrication.  Oh and just so we we all crystal fucking clear- unmasking non-relevant people is HIGHLY ILLEGAL.  

Obama and his team should be in deep shit for this.

He didn't WARN about Flynn, he gave the order to illegally unmask him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Almost all purely socialist countries can't really afford anything.  Their currencies are out of control.  In communist Venezuela you need to bring shoeboxes of cash to buy bread.  This happened in Europe in the past.

I agree.  Out HC system is messed up.  It needs serious overhaul, but change like that should come from a market disrupter like Alphabet and FB upset the advertising industry.  Like Netflix, Hulu and HBO On Demand upset the Cable Industry.  Like Pixar and Dreamworks SKG (Spielberg, Katzenberg, Geffen) upset Disney Animation.  None of the great innovations in non-war have come from The State.  

Healthcare should be no different.  Healthcare should be let loose, to innovate, not to be gripped tighter by the all powerful Federal Government. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ooooh, one more I wanted to share was 'The Meaning of Night' by Michael Cox.  It was his debut novel and at the time sold for a record 500,000 (for a debut novel).

Sadly the author died 3 years later but scrambled out this 600 page masterpiece.

I fully intend to buy the follow up novel as well. Hopefully it's as gripping and imaginative.

Thanks for the recommendation!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am fascinated by 'Mystery Novels' set in the grand 1800's where wit and intellect ruled over tools of science and technology.  

A great read of this is Wilkie Collin's 'The Moonstone' and the incomplete but fantastic 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' by Charles Dickens.  Sadly Dickens passed away before finishing the murder mystery but it was his attempt at dipping his mighty pen into the field as well.

Any recommendations for a solid Victorian Mystery Novel that's fun, suspenseful and on par w Dickens, Collins or the like? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of everything they overcame together, the one thing they couldn't beat was childbirth.  Everything society threw at them, handled.  Making a baby on their own, disaster.  What I didn't understand is WHY Hemingway chose to kill her off.  The story was about the war, however fucked up war can be, everyone did their best as individuals.  Still having friends, falling in love, etc etc.  then she dies, for like no reason.  I wondered if Hemingway was recently scorned when writing it and wanted to kill love in his story to reflect the pain in his own heart.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The last paragraph of the Gatsby is amazing 

So we beat on, like boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past

But leading up to (spoiler!!) Gatzbys death it seemed that every character changed 180.  And of course I didn't want Daisey to stay with Tom!  Fuck him he's a lying cheating asshole!  She should have left him.  

I know it's thematically fits.  Gatsbys name is derived from gun, etc etc. but Buchannon has him murdered by pushing his lover's husband towards Gatsby and then doing nothing afterwards.  But again, just wanted the good guy to win

<TEXT> Yes, it's RJ.  He ran on a platform of Jobs!!!  But I can tell you that in WI there are MAJOR (mannnnny Billion $ industries) which are blue collar and hire people for solid long term union labor jobs working in paper mills, ship yards, etc that fire them at their 89th day.  Because on day 90 they are granted Union Membership.

Now Blue Collar Unions aren't without their own issues (lots of issues) but firing perfectly good workers at day 89 so you don't have to provide them benefits like health insurance, vacation, dental and eye care is unethical, and unamerican.  Not to mention blaming it on drugs . . . 

Maybe r/Trees would agree, but smoking a joint on the weekend shouldn't disqualify you from pushing pallets of supplies around a factory floor.  Treat it like alcohol.  Enjoy on your own time </TEXT>

Wisconsin does not need half a million refugees (the size of 3 or 4 Green Bays) to take jobs away from Americans.

How about we have tougher schools and crack down on the drug problems instead of just abandoning Americans who are rough around the edges </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's about civilians trying to survive the firebombing of Dresden.  Don't want to give too many spoilers.  

From a historical context, go research WW2 Dresden Firebombing.  We kinda already won the war, and Dresden was purely a civilian city w no industry or military significance.  Allied Generals knew this and bombed it to oblivion w a specific type of two phase bombing.  1st blow the roofs off buildings w altitude sensing conventional bombs. 2nd follow those up w purely incendiary fire bombs, which now hit exposed wood rafters.  It turned Dresden into one large oven.  Reports of casualties range from 30,000 to 210,000.  Based on refugees fleeing Nazi Germany (Eastern Front) the death toll was probably on the higher side. 

Edit: ps it's a fictional novel set in the framework of this event.  No idea what all the deletes were. Anything saucy? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't say radical.  Just more a-political and Ayn Rand's books, however much we dream of a world w objective leaders (regardless of political affiliation), her books are seen as very political.

She believes in charity of the heart, with an individual's choice on how, when, where, and how much charity to give; rather than an across the board forced charity through taxes (at the point of a gun was her common saying).  Because if you refuse to pay taxes they come to your house and demand payment.  If you refuse payment they threaten you w jail.  If you refuse jail they forceably throw you in jail, via armed officers of the law, possibly pointing guns at you if you resist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1984 and BNW are both similar but to me 1984 is as if WW2 never ended and told from the side of Russia where as BNW is as if technology becomes so advanced that people lose their ethical and moral compass, bowing to convenience and comfort.  But both books use media and manipulation of facts to distort perceptions.  Creating a weapon of mass media and publication for control of the masses.  Great many parallels! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every Governmental entity in the United States of America runs Property Taxes almost identical.

Your taxes are based on what's called a 'mill rate', derived from how much grain you needed to support the water wheel mill.  

Taxes are still called mills.  A rage of need is determined first, then the taxes are applied evenly across all real estate in the district.  If your district is taxed at 1.30 psf plus fees and special assessments, then that's your starting point.  If your property is below average, then technically you are overpaying. 

It's, pardon the pun, but par for the course, for large portfolio owners to hire outside firms to protest their taxes on their behalf. 

Say your taxes are 250,000 for a property and the tax firm protests them down to 175,000, saving your firm 75,000.  The firm will keep anywhere from 20,000 to 40,000, after expenses, depending on your agreement.  So the owner is saving less, but still some.

Sometimes owners don't give a shit.  Because 100% of the taxes are paid by tenants.  So they just pass that expense on to the occupant and get fully reimbursed.

For properties like Trumps golf courses, it's definitely more challenging to protest taxes.  And if I were him, for Mel a Largo I'd just pay whatever the county said they were.  For two reasons: 1- it's probably a hugely profitable place and arguing lower value is likely a losing battle.  2- Better PR.

But for other less performing assets, protesting taxes is the most fair thing to do.  If you are being over-charged by a blanket calculation then, and you DONT speak up and say 'hey this is unfair' then it's your own fault.

I get that this is a hit piece on Trump to make web-clicks for minting money.  And it's a political hit piece as well.  But honestly, every smart property owner, real estate investor, tenant rep, and REIT is doing the exact same thing.

Until local municipalities learn to value assets one by one, nothing (unfortunately) about this process will change </TEXT>

Will we meet their neurotic vulgarities with vacillation and weakness?

<TEXT> Networking is extremely complicated. 

Say for example you and some buddies (guys and girls!) are playing CoD, LoL, or WoW.  

You all have amazing ping and YUGE network connectivity.  See, companies like Riot Games or Sony or Blizzard Entertainment can PAY to make sure you have the fastest access possible, because it's important to them, no, it's VITAL to the success of their gaming to keep you connected.  They have a right to offer money to make it so.

Now take the Cuckington Post.  Blazing fast connections to their servers aren't really that important.  Loading that propaganda bullshit 1.3 seconds faster isn't going to really make anyone rage-quit their shitty biased website.  So they aren't likely to want to offer money for more bandwidth and direct access.

Where Net Neutrality comes in to play, is to say that NO ONE can pay for better access to data flow.  Regardless of how critical it is to their success.

This is why Net Neutrality needs to die.

People who own products and services need to be able to sell them openly in whatever fashion they want.  If you don't want the products, don't buy em.  If you want em, but don't want theirs, go buy em from someone else.

But no human being has a RIGHT to take property (or information) from someone else, just because 'they want it, like really bad'.

BS Ive seen this video also being used as "illegal Mexicans" anything to spread hate You could find videos for any agenda"

As if punching a girl and kicking her when she's on the ground isn't spreading hate?  

I'd have defended her by putting that guy through the window.

Humans have words.  Learn to use them.  If you can't, we will defend ourselves and the rights of others to exercise their words freely and without violent repercussions, no matter how stupid or frustratingly dumb.  Everyone in America has a right to speak.

Transferring 250,000,000,000 to Pakistan and other alt-left questionable slush funds isn't enough?

<TEXT> After all deductions, for a renter who is head of houshold, you can deduct around $10,200.  The theory is this is the cost to live.  

Tell me in what planet can a person live for $10,200?

This number should be tripled.

Also: rent!!!  Just because you rent vs own, an individual cannot deduct rent at any level, but a business can.  

People who rent, like people who have mortgage interest, should get to deduct that cost up to a certain amount.  $1k a month?  $2k a month?  Something that makes sense for people.  This would also help parents with kids in college! </TEXT>

But it's critical to the success of America.

Our industries, like US Steel (Carnegie) founded this country.  They are the backbone of our infrastructure.

And I've the past 8 years, cheap crappy steel from you-know-where, mined with slave-wage labor and environment irrelevance.

Unlike American Steel, which is up to par environmentally and funded with long term Union Factory jobs and benefits.

This is what Making America Great Again is fighting for.  This is why we wanted to win the election.  Help American workers and American Industry.

One thing I was SUPER excited about playing with was the weapon / item cruncher in BL-PreSeq.

I was Soooooo disappointed to find out that none of the red-texts or specials would be transferred to the new item

Imagine adding a Bee Shield and a Vlad Shield only to get a corrosive spike splash damage added onto amped shots!  How fun!  I'd farm bees and Vlads like crazy just for the small chance they blend.

Or a life drain grenade + a magic missile + fire storm

<TEXT> Well, a lot of Christian and Jewish ceremonies were based off a whole pantheon of Pagan, Roman, Greek, Old Testimwnt, etc practices

Around 325, the Council of Nicaea, organized and somewhat negotiated by Constantine kinda came to a meet-halfway for those ceremonies.  

But Christianity's core strength is to allow varying viewpoints and practices within it religion, and most people follow the simple Judaea-Christian ethics of 'love thy neighbor'.  Makes the world a better place!

Hope you're having a great day as well!  


Cary on 'pedes!

I'm fine w his emotions, the Solo death scene, although predictable, was well done.

It's his fight scene vs Fin and Rey that was totally implausible given his training.

Compare it to Darth Maul's fighting, and he dies after only one film </TEXT>

<TEXT> In America we have free speech.  Yes, and his speech is protected.

But that doesn't mean there aren't consequences for proclaiming said speech.

As a Univ Professor tweeting publicly in a non-joking manner to 'hang the president'   'the sooner and the higher the better' is grounds for treatment as a direct threat to The POTUS.

I hope he spends time on a small cage reflecting on his words

I see Assembly Vos' point, but unless you can guarantee all cookies are made in 100% perfect pass health inspection kitchens, just let them eat cake already </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was thinking about this today.

For example a dude was using dioxsis grenade in a walker assault (graveyard of giants) and . . . Obv it was dumb.

But what if dioxsis somehow did more damage inside than outside.  

What if other star cards were also modified based on environmental factors.  Say Hoth (excess cold) makes Vehicles more susceptible to damage.

Basically chance the validity of a package so it's not all the same, depending on what map you are on and whether it's cold, windy, enclosed, ventilated, sunny, rainy, etc </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had to paste the whole article because it kept crashing on me:


Here you go!

WASHINGTON  The spying by the Obama administration on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump reportedly was even worse than what he has alleged.

And it had nothing to do with Russia but everything to do with politics.

Sources in the intelligence community claim the potentially illegal revealing of names, or unmasking, of people in the Trump camp who were under surveillance was done purely for political purposes to hurt and embarrass (candidate) Trump and his team.

The bombshell revelations come from rank and file members of the intelligence community who are fighting back against a stonewall by the leaders at the nations spy agencies, according to Fox News.

Reporter Adam Housley said the sources are not Trump people but are frustrated with the politics that is taking place in these (intelligence) agencies.

And what they have revealed is amazing. Here is what they told Fox:

1) Surveillance targeting the Trump team during the Obama administration began months ago, even before the president had become the GOP nominee in July.

2)The spying on the Trump team had nothing to do with the collection of foreign intelligence or an investigation into Russia election interference.

3) The spying was done purely for political purposes that have nothing to do with national security and everything to do with hurting and embarrassing Trump and his team.

4) The person who did the unmasking was someone very well known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world, and is not in the FBI.

5) Congressional investigators know the name of at least one person who was unmasking names.

6) The initial surveillance on the Trump team led to a number of names being unmasked.
7) House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has known about the unmasking since January.

8) Two sources in the intelligence community told Nunes who did the unmasking and told him at least one of the names of someone in the Trump team who was unmasked. The sources also gave Nunes the serial numbers of the classified reports that documented the unmasking.

9) It took Nunes a number of weeks to figure out how to see those intelligence reports because the intelligence agencies were stonewalling him, and not allowing the chairman or other people to see them.

10) There were only two places Nunes could have seen the information: where the sources work, which would have blown their cover; and the Eisenhower Executive Office building on the White House grounds, which houses the National Security Council and has computers linked to the secure system containing the reports he sought.

11) Nunes got access to that system on March 21 with the help of two Trump administration officials.

The Wall Street Journals Kimberly Strassel reported that the documents Nunes saw confirming the Obama administration spied on the Trump team for months arent easily obtainable, since they arent the finished intelligence products that Congress gets to see.

She said there were dozens of documents with information about Trump officials.
Strassel also reported there was a stonewall against the Intelligence committee chairman because, for weeks Mr. Nunes has been demanding intelligence agencies turn over said documentswith no luck, so far.

She also learned that, along with former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, one other Trump official was unmasked.
(Flynn resigned after his unmasking was leaked to the press as part of reports that he spoke on the phone with the Russian ambassador before the new administration took office. President Trump said the two discussed nothing inappropriate and Flynn was just doing his job, but the president asked for the aides resignation because he was not completely honest in his initial account of the conversation.)

But even the reports that did not unmask identities were written in ways that made clear which Trump officials were being discussed.
And, importantly, the documents were circulated at the highest levels of government.

Strassel concluded, To sum up, Team Obama was spying broadly on the incoming administration.

What do YOU think? Is Obama spying scandal worse than Watergate? Sound off in todays WND poll.

Fox also reports that the Senate Judiciary Committee is looking into whether leaks of information targeting the Trump team could have come from the FBI, because it requested Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, warrants that led to the acquisition of some of the foreign surveillance.

Nunes has said the FBI has not responded to his requests for information, and a source told Fox the agency is refusing to cooperate with the House investigation.

Fox also reported the Senate Judiciary Committee is looking into whether the FBI wrongly included political opposition research from Trumps opponents in its probe.

And whether the FBI paid a former British spy who wrote a sensational and discredited report alleging wild improprieties by Trump and his aides.

On Friday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer noted the day before the president tweeted his accusation that Obama had spied on him, comments were made by a senior administration official, foreign policy expert, Dr. Evelyn Farkas, (which) together with previous reports that have been out, raised serious concerns on whether or not there was an organized and widespread effort by the Obama administration to use and leak highly sensitive intelligence information for political purposes.
As WND reported in depth, Farkas appeared tohave inadvertently confirmed the former presidents administration spied on then President-elect Trumps transition team for political purposes.

Speaking on MSNBC March 2, she confirmed that not only was the previous administration collecting intelligence on the Trump team, it wasattempting to share it as far and wide as possible.

Farkas (Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Evelyn Farkas) claimed the information was about Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, but just days later, intelligence chiefs who had seen the classified information in question, including Obamas own former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper as well as former acting CIA Director Michael Morell, said they have seen no evidence of collusion between the Trump team and the Russian government.

That would appear to indicate the real reason the Obama administration was feverishly collecting and sharing the classified information was not for national security purposes, but for political reasons.
On Friday, Spicer said, Dr. Farkass admissions alone are devastating.

And that, [I]n the ordinary course of their work, NSC  National Security Council  staff discovered information that may support the questions raised by the President and Dr. Farkass claim. These are serious issues. They raise serious concerns. And if true, the issues would be devastating.

Spicer then lectured reporters for ignoring the Farkas story and growing evidence that Obama did indeed spy on the Trump team, scolding them, [I]f everyone was treating the President and the administration fairly, youd ask a series of much different questions.

<TEXT> I agree w the Deep State comment, but I think Comey has the best interests of America 1st.

Part of that is not throwing 100% of the prior administration in jail (where legally they all technically belong), because it would look reaaaaaaly bad and if The American People knew everything Obummer and Hitlary did, mass chaos would ensue (just a theory).  So I get the sense he's balancing between quietly collecting evidence against anyone involved to use as leverage later, while trying to protect the integrity of our institutions (Executive, Legislative and Judicial)

A: Paul Ryan needs to get on the Trump Train and ask what bills in what format will be executed by the Executive Office (POTUS)

B: Paul Ryan puts forth his own versions of bills and sees what flies through POTUS.

If I were Paul Ryan, I'd pick option A.  It seems like less guess-work and increases POTUS reputation points.

Option B means you'd out all this time and energy into a bill only to have it fail.  Lots of work, maybe little output  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes basically words.  

If they have foreign currency debt, say valued in Euros or US$ or even Chinese Yuan or Japanese Yen, it just makes it easier for them to market said debt to outside investors.

Then an investor who wants exposure to that type of currency would buy it.  Who might that be?  Most likely an importer or exporter of products to or from a country that matches the currency they are selling to.  

But doing that puts more work on Denmark's Treasury Dept because they have to do all the math and peg their own currency appropriately to not screw over the foreign currency bond holders.  Why does Denmark care about not screwing over bond holders?  Because it keeps their cost of borrowing down and makes for easier long term planning (like when they decide to build a massive infrastructure project and need to borrow).

So by paying off all foreign currency denominated debt, they just wash their hands of the rest of the world and say 'who ever wants to hold our bonds, (both foreign and domestic) you're getting paid back in our currency'.  

The one strategic advantage of this is that you remove all risk that the foreign currency's controller decides to stop printing money (tighten monetary policy) and would devalue your bonds outside of your control.  Aside from that, the difference is very little. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Misleading title.  It's not free of foreign debt.  It's free of foreign CURRENCY debt.

Debt is a loan against a country's ability to levy taxes.  Currency debt is a loan against a country's ability to levy taxes denominated in a currency other than its own, and requires a more complicated monthly valuation schedule, but it's not that different from standard long term debt.

Kill points should only be high when matched to an objective.  Like sometimes I get a double kill from a grenade or an orbital and I get like 300 points.  That's 250 too many imo </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your KD ratio was higher than mine when I hit 100. But my Win Ratio (I'm not game leaver) was higher.

I find (frustrating) that a lot of people play the game just to get high K/D ratios.  Even taking heroes far away from risk to snipe (Solo's Lucky Shot for example).

Anyway Grat man!

Media reports that the plane went down in poor visibility are untrue.  The Tower manager at Martha's Vineyard (where the plane went down) say there were stars out and that visibility was between 10 and 12 miles that night.

The NTSB concluded that JFK Jr was described by his trainers as an "excellent", "methodical" and "very cautious" pilot.  If he was such a careful pilot why, when he got into difficulty, would he not have engaged the autopilot that was capable of flying the plane to within 100 feet of the airport?

JFK Jr was actually a highly experienced pilot with enough hours under his belt to qualify for an instructor's license.

The mysterious flight instructor.  Early reports of the accident said there was a flight instructor on boardthen all of a sudden the flight instructor disappeared from accounts of the accident.  It is just not a reasonable conclusion that Kennedy did not have a flight instructor on board.  He had flown a total of 310 hours and of those, 55 hours were at night.  He had only flown 45 minutes of those 55 hours at night without an instructor.  He was very cautious and had his wife and her sister on board so it just doesn't add up that he didn't have an instructor with him.

The logbook is missing.  The logbook would have recorded the presence of a flight instructor on the plane but has never been recovered.

The US Coast Guard reports that JFK Jr had contacted the tower on his final approach.  FAA regulations require that a search begins immediately when a plane hasn't landed within five minutes of reporting a final approach.  Why did it take a staggering 14 hours then for a search to commence?

The FAA went on to claim that there was never a communication from Kennedy to the tower despite all the immediate news reports to the contrary.

It took five days to find the plane. How come the Emergency Locator Transmitter which sends out a beacon signal in the event of a crash didn't alert the rescue party?  
Nothing in the NTSB report was mentioned about the ELT so we don't know if it was missing or even disabled.

The presence of a black box.  No other private non-jet plane in service at the time had a black box (the flight recorder), yet Kennedy had one installed on his plane. Why? Even more suspicious, the battery had been removed from the black box, meaning there was no record of any conversation in the cockpit.

The fuel valve. According to the NTSB report the fuel valve had been turned to OFF.  This could not have been done by accident.  Obviously the fuel valve is highly important and would never be turned off mid-flightdoing so at full speed would result in the engine dying in 45 seconds.  

Therefore the valves are fitted with a safety release button that must be pushed down and held while the valve is being turned.  Kennedy wasn't committing suicide so who turned the valve off?  The non-existent flight instructor </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obama sent $3B to a DoJ controlled slush fund as a way to give money towards political activism.  They in turn gave, at his direction, the money to Correct the Record, Black Lives Matter, etc.

The 'Sessions' did this or 'Trump did that' are a false flags.
Also, this is why Reddit Admins set a different post from T_D to zero upvotes this morning.  They are being paid to try and hide the story.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Playing a board of Walker Assault.  Game JUST started and it's 0-0


Suddenly my radar goes fuzzy.  Realizing this is an enemy scout trait, tread cautiously.  I see him, kill him, all good.

Radar goes back to normal.  

Then I think, should my radar go wonky if the game just started?  Isn't that a level 3 trait?  Sooo, then he's hacking?  On XBox1?

I played about 5 or 6 WAs, but only one against this person, most on his team.  Each game he went like 45 - 10 or something.  His worst was probably 30-19.  Hacks?  On XBox1?

Or is Scout the new real deal?   </TEXT>

<TITLE> James White Deserves SB MVP </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-06 19:43:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> James White was robbed of Super Bowl MVP by NFL Films and the history of Tom Brady

As in they want to have a Tom Brady is the greatest ever story, and his MVP had to be a part of that narrative.

Pats lose that game w/o James White.  They probably lose it w/o Brady too, but come on 

3 TD
2 Pt Conv
SB Record 14 Receptions (beating out players like Jerry Rice, Demaryius Thomas, Wes Welker)
SB record 20 Points
Game High 110 Yards Receiving
29 Yards Rushing (not a lot, but two runs were for scores)
SB Record for OT points, scores, TD's etc

Brady says he'll give him the truck.  James White will have NO Problem affording a 'truck' come next contract.

But Tom Brady should turn down the MVP award and give it entirely, or  at least demand to share it w James White as Co-MVP; in title, officially </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lately I've been having issues Forming a Party IN SWBF only.  I can be in an XBox group, talking to friends, we are all in the same XBox Party, but I don't even show them online.

I've reset my Xbox 1 S, Reinstalled the game, tested all my network settings (400 upload, 50 download, 55 ms delay, 0%packet loss).  I SHOULD have 1,000 upload and 1,000 download as I'm on Fiber Gigabyte, less than a mile from the telco center.

But, I can't see friends.  They CAN see me.  

Suggestions? Is this just a SWBF E A Server issue? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So The Donald is building a wall, and a pipeline.

And I support those decisions.  Even a pipeline that runs next to Tribal Lands, when done properly can be safe and profitable.

But walls and pipelines need steel.  Walls need metal rebar and pipelines are made from steel.

US Steel, and American firm based in BASED Steeler County (PA) is a top supplier of high grade steel.  Ticker: X

Steel Dynamics is a high grade steel manufacturer producing almost 8 million tons annually.  Based in BASED Indiana.  Ticker: STLD

Allegheny Technologies is a manufacture of specialty metals (like titanium, nickel, cobalt alloys) and of course steel.  Based Pitt, PA.  Ticker: ATI

These are just a few companies that will benefit from The Donald, POTUS.  And. . . They are in states that voted for him :-)

Just thought I'd share for you Pedes too.  Please do your own investing research before investing.

Disclaimer!!! I am long X and STLD but have no position in ATI.  Im not a broker nor a partner, employee or controller in any of these firms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been a Packer Fan since before I could walk.

Growing up in N Wisconsin, w my mom screaming at the TV (THAT WAS A #%*ing FOUL YOU %^**ing REF) I knew that whatever was happening was important.  My mom never swore, and never yelled.  Except when the Packers were on.

When playing pickup football in the neighborhood, I was always John Jefferson and my cousin was James Lofton.  The dynamic duo wide receivers of the Lynn Dickey era.  Sure we didn't win any Super Bowls in those days, and we barely made the playoffs, but dammit, people loved Their Packers.

In the Favre years, winning became more common, and FINALLY in the 1996/97 season Lombardi came back home.

Favre, hate him or love him, I'd still do it all over again (w/o the Mandritch draft though lol).

Fast forward to Rodgers and Company.  Another Homecoming for Lombardi and finally tied the Bears al-time series!  For those of us tracking that when we were 20 games down, it was a long road, but we got there.  

Rodgers has at his helm one of the greatest offenses ever assembled, and like the NFL of late, injuries are more common, but the talent is there.  

Watching Randall Cobb and our D step up last week in a Playoff game was uplifting and impressive.  I'm proud of how they played, and the Reffing, aside from the Nelson hit, was pretty fair.

And although Tiki Barber's 'G is for Greatness' might not be the official history, to all the fans, City of Green Bay, and real-everyday-people owners like you and me, G will always 'stand' for Greatness.  Greatness in the passion and love of our team.  Greatness of character in our players and fans.  Greatness in respect for visiting teams and fans.  And Greatness in our pursuit of bringing Lombardi home again in 2017.

Go.
Pack.
Go.

<TITLE> Advice on choosing a Vanguard RothIRA fund </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-05 21:20:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have just under $20K in my Roth IRA money market. Basically I've been contributing but haven't bought any funds the past few years.

Have just under $100K in the Windsor Fund (Admiral shares) VWNAX and $50k in Wellington (Investor shares) VWELX.

I have 401k, pension all that jazz and no need for cash.  This is my self directed fun retirement money but having $20k sitting idle seems silly.  But buying the market at DJIA approaching 20k also seems silly.

Based on my current holdings, any advice on other Vanguard funds?  Or wait for a market drop? </TEXT>
