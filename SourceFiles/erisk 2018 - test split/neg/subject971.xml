<TEXT> As an LOTR lover, I am inclined to agree with this but also because it is a fact. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope you don't give up. David Copperfield, as someone pointed out, is one of the more comprehensible amongst Dickens' other novels. 

If I remember correctly, the novel points out early on that it is an older David who is recounting the story and as a result, several times, the perspective provided is one shared between two Davids: a younger one growing up, and the present one who provides snippets of additional 'wisdom' because he has the benefit of hindsight. Then, throughout this continues - the mature David often times alludes to events that might happen in the future, that he has now already lived through, even though he is recalling a point in time where the boy David has no clue whatsoever is happening.

So, it took me a bit of time to adjust with this going forward into the novel. Could this be the same for you? I'm not saying this might be the reason you can't comprehend it, but this was it for me.

<TEXT> Too many times, you're not alone! 

I remember a creative writing class in uni when the professor gave us only Flaubert's description of Madame Bovary's hat and we were asked to draw that out on individual sheets of paper to be handed in anonymously. When we were all done and the prof was showing each piece off, I noticed mine was one of those that looked just odd and completely different from what it was intended to be (and I am a Lit major, how terrible)... So, yes, I've had to reimagine several times now but I'm glad I'm not alone here :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh wow, 8 times is plenty! That's amazing, I hope to discover a new fave that will not burn out even after this number of times. I guess my closest comparable read would be Tolkien's The Hobbit - I think I've read it 3 times now but it hasn't gone stale on me, and I hope it will never! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This. I borrow books from the library all the time and the deadline is actually a bigger factor in this. Hey, no worries, I wish to live to 120 myself by God's grace so it's only 90+ years more of reading to enjoy :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, there're too many good books out there to discover and time just shouldn't be wasted when a book isn't doing it for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> the curious case of iiRenity, you've gone and done it in reverse! :D 

But all jokes aside, congratulations on keeping to your goal - I believe it must've been very tough esp when a comfort read is needed for whatever circumstance. Well, I really hope you get to reread some faves this summer...may it be a happy reunion! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Usually a few chapters in for me. But then again, I tend to go back to books I put down earlier on just to see if perhaps I was not in a suitable frame or mood. 

I've attempted Suzuki's Ring as well, but it wasn't for me too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ha! Oh man, I guess "get through" is probably not the best phrase here then. Hmm it's just that they are ALL equally enticing, that's what I meant, hence the dilemma. 

I completely agree with you however, on reading what you want, when you want. I tend to juggle books as a result, but hey all in good time right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey that's awesome, I rarely reread books as well but I find it amazing that you've read Gravity's Rainbow twice now already! Personally, Pynchon's books have been tough going although I had to read Lot 49 for a class--didn't enjoy it unfortunately.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, what a coincidence--LOTR is one of those I hope to pick up again! Absolutely one of my faves that I want to reread but haven't gotten the chance to, what with all the amazing new titles distracting me heh. I agree with you though, on reading what comes naturally. You do you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> On one hand, I've been meaning to reread some favourites since many were read a long while ago, and it bothers me that I can't seem to remember chunks of content from the books I claim to love. But on the other hand, I have a pile-up of attractive new books to get through...

Do you have the same dilemma? </TEXT>

<TEXT> read it for a class and didn't think I'd enjoy it but as you've said, it turned out to be really good in the end, neat and satisfying. Other than, I've only read Oliver Twist, Hard Times and A Christmas Carol. Attempted Bleak House but couldn't get into it unfortunately. </TEXT>
