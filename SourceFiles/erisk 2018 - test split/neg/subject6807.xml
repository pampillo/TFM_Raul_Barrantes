<TEXT>  Donner's Superman was oje of my faves. The way the names fly off the screen was epic.

Oh shit yeah! Hadn't thought about that one for a while, but loved it as a kid. The word epic is genuinely fitting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much. I also liked You're Next.

With both films I had very limited knowledge about what I were about to see, hadn't watched any trailers or anything, that probably has something to do with my reaction. Not sure how I would have felt if I had been primed for something specific. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had read it too. It was a pretty faithful adaptation, but I felt something got lost in the translation. 

But now that you have reminded me of the film, I do remember thinking there were some scenes with Doctor Manhattan and Rorschach that I enjoyed as well. 

In the end I just didn't feel that much about it though. It came and went, whereas the comic has stayed with me.

<TEXT>  Plus the action scenes are always entertaining, and if that's your cup of tea - rather than the friendships and romances that I enjoy - there's a shit-ton of it in the new season.

I enjoy both and think they reinforce each other. The reason why it's so exhilarating when they come together to beat the shit out of someone, isn't just because those scenes are so amazingly well done, it's because you care about and know the characters. Sure, seeing them switch back and forth would be cool anyway because it's so well shot and edited, but knowing the people makes it immensely more satisfying. 

And vice versa. Understanding just how far they go for each other and the extremes they experience, makes the light farcical stuff with Lito for instance, hit that much harder.

It's a wonderful blend of all sorts of genres and at no point do they ever seem to look down upon any of it, which makes them all believable in some way.

<TEXT>  The problem is, if they did such an adaptation, the film might get lost in the shuffle as just a Western with a Sci-Fi twist. 

I agree. I also think the entire climax would make for a quite arty movie, not the kind of thing that's a solid foundation for a franchise that's going to need money later on. That's not to say it wouldn't be cool, just that it wouldn't be commercially viable.

King is a great storyteller, but he doesn't always seem to care all that much about making his stories fit neatly into the classic mainstream Hollywood three act structure with inciting incidents, resolutions and all that jazz.

All that aside, I've been watching some modern westerns lately (Bone Tomahawk, Open Range, Meek's Cutoff) and it's a great malleable genre, so it's a shame people don't really watch it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't read Game of Thrones, but going by the show it strikes me as a much more conventional political intrigue and drama within a fantasy setting type thing than any of the bananas stuff King threw in his books. 

Sure, it's violent and there's sex, but Wizard of Oz elements doesn't pop up and there aren't any cowboys and junkies encountering a cyborg bear.

Some things are simply easier to adapt into another medium. That's not to say they are easy, just easier. And King has a feverish crazy imagination that often makes his stuff hard to deal with when visualized (and then a turtle showed up).

I think epics can be filmed (Hollywood has been making those things since the silent era) if someone is willing to throw the money at it and who knows, if HBO weren't already doing a fantasy show and lining a huge science fiction show up to take over their money making throne, they maybe would have or could have done The Dark Tower, but it's not in the cards now. And I believe they were asked at some point while it was being dragged around and rejected everywhere, so they must have declined for a reason.

And like I said, if this film is as badly received by the general public as it has been by the internet, no channel is going to touch it with a ten feet pole. Major flops have a tainted vibe too them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No one is going to pick a major failure up right away. It'll be at least a decade, likely a lot more.

People tried for years to get a more faithful adaptation off the ground, but no one would have any of it, so they finally decided to this one in the hopes that it could work as a sort of backdoor pilot to an expanded universe of films and TV shows. If people completely rejects this and it bombs, as it looks like after the trailer came out, it won't suddenly become a hot property. The opposite in fact.

I understand people want a 100% true to the material adaptation, but most also seems to want something with at least some money behind it. Those two things are not possible at the same time, since the material is so strange and out there. If this one had been well received, I think the money folks would have been much more willing to go *"A talking train you say? Guess it could be worse..."*

Blockbusters can make the people sitting on the cash oddly adventurous, but they aren't just going to throw the dollars out for the fun of it.

Btw, there was some rumours the W G show would have ended up a Netflix production since the company has worked with them before. Alas... </TEXT>

So I would recommend that you wait and read the series after having seen the film. </TEXT>

Maybe certain populist politicians does fan the flames, but there already has to be something wrong with someone if they figure this is a "solution".

Or maybe I'm naive and people really are that easily influenced. I don't know.

I guess it did make it better when I went back and watched from Rose (even read a bit up the history of the show and saw a couple of the old series as well), simply because the universe and the show's longevity is fascinating, but as a jumping on point with no knowledge I felt it worked perfectly.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The intention was to do a show after this film (based on Wizard and Glass), but seeing the extremely negative reception to this trailer, that's probably out the window.

I don't think we'll be getting any more films or shows, sadly. I would have loved to have seen some of the later stuff like Blaine and the rest of Roland's crew, but I especially would have loved that prequel show, which has apparently already been written.

I imagine right now the studio are scrambling to just promote this one film hard enough it'll make a tiny profit and then sell all rights as fast as possible. Probably not what they expected when they released the trailer, but at least the money people who said no to Howard's original extremely ambitious plan are likely happy.

It's weird to me that so many fans say they want a 100% faithful adaptation, despite knowing that would never happen within the studio system (these books are insane), but then at least we get this that should lead to much of that stuff they want, like the Ka-tet which the director said he was looking forward to introducing... and then the fans shit all over it.


Ah well, maybe in a decade or two, someone will try again.

Don't get me wrong, I think it's a terrific hour of TV, just not in any way vastly more interesting, well made or well acted than other episodes.

It only works because of everything that surrounds it, like most good shows.

I wonder if it's because it dives deep into the supernatural that most find it to be in a class of its own? </TEXT>

This being a sequel/remix does mean they will likely make a *lot* of changes, but hopefully most of them will work to the film's advantage. Fingers crossed!

<TEXT> Some of that seems kind of obvious to me. One movie because more movies cost more money and this isn't exactly batman or LOTR.

 And the plan is still to do more films and TV if the movie is a success. Wizard of Glass as a series is what's up next, Howard mentioned it again last week, but only if this one makes money.

 Any sort of direct adaptation would obviously not work if you want a huge audience and you wouldn't get the kind of money needed. The Gunslinger would likely be too odd as a start to a franchise... the whole series would actually be way too out there if adapted directly.

You can read the 2014 draft, might answer a few of your questions.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5lHQAVEce61bmtjSHJ0MklVVVE/view

There's also been interviews with King, Howard, Goldsman and Arcel where they touch on at least some of what you bring up. You will have to google, but I know at least a couple are from EW.

Hope that helps, if not fingers crossed someone involved might do an AMA so you can ask them directly.

Obviously this has changed a bit ever since the film became a thing, but I still know people who have read It, Christine and much of that stuff, but would never touch anything that smells like fantasy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'm surprised at the amount of hate this is getting on /r/movies. 

If the general public is going to react the same way, this will be a major flop. The hatred is **strong** in r/movies.

I would have loved that Wizard and Glass TV show, but it doesn't seem likely now. Ah well, what can you do...

Still looking forward to the film even if most aren't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it could be done. The boys doesn't have much to do besides talk as they're walking, so plenty of stuff could be externalized and verbalized. And the spine of it would mean a constant suspenseful tone that could carry anything that might be too expositiony. Darabont is a terrific writer, so I don't see him having any trouble with those things.

It's what I would consider one of his easier books to adapt.  </TEXT>

I would also like to recommend an episode of the TV show Banshee, but that show isn't horror and it's only one episode that's a siege one, so kinda asking a lot to have the OP sit through four seasons for one little bit. It was a fantastic episode though and a great homage to Carpenter.  </TEXT>

So it was nice that your folks' sub was a bit of a haven.

 The 100 is not about romances, it's about survival.

And death. Don't forget death, he will feel left out.

Chad Hodge was the showrunner and the Duffer Brothers had a lot more to do with the show than Shyamalan. 

I haven't seen the marketing thing material, but I imagine they played up how much of a Shyamalan show it was since no one knew who those other people were. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's true but it's a historical thing I think, so hard to change.

I suspect Disney, as wonderful as their movies are, had a lot to do with it by going the fairytale and family route. Fantasia was an attempt to do something different, but it was a flop so they stopped trying. Until they *kind of* tried with The Black Cauldron, but by then people were positioned to expect something specific, so once again they had a flop on their hand. 

Other studios tried to keep some of the Disney elements, yet change the formula a bit with stuff like Bluth's NIMH and Titan A.E. Also flops.

I just don't see any way to break that old school look at animation now. Hell, even cartoons that weren't specifically aimed at kids, like the old WB stuff, have kind of seen their characters repackaged into kids stuff for modern audience, because that's where the money is.

<TEXT> That would be catering to the actor instead of doing the story, so can't say I agree. I believe they should stay true stylistically to what they're overall doing. In this case we're mainly seeing the story from the handmaid's POV, we're in their shoes, not change it in order to please fans of specific actors.

And besides, she can play moments both big and small, so it doesn't even hamper her.

Dowd could do an entire silent movie about folding laundry or reading a book in only extreme wide shots and it would likely still be riveting. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   The scene where the sheriff pulls icecubes from the box, right from the dead girls palm, and eats one not knowing theres a spot of blood on his lips, is a great moment.

That is a truly wonderful little scene. But the problem for me is that much of the film is just a little boring. I watched both II and III again about a month ago, and it just doesn't come alive unless people are being killed.

Don't get me wrong, looked at as a slasher it's actually not bad, just that it's not only following a Classic, but also a surprisingly good belated sequel so it can only seem inconsequential. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If we go with R M being really stupid, what do when then use for genuinely really stupid shows? 

I actually find there to be a ton of clever and fun science fiction ideas explored, lots of nifty and often interesting use of pop culture references and some very complex plotting. Between the burps.

It's even kind of edgy at times, at least for a goofy animated show. Like when we see a society turn a blind eye to a rapist because hey we already made his statue and legacy and shit. 

It's no Fuller House that's for sure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But I also noticed the distinct increase in quality as the season continued 

I didn't feel that way at all. Obviously we cant be as invested right from the start, but that goes for most stories, and everything else (cinematography, editing, music etc) was already in place. For instance one of my favourite moments is still the fight scene at the end of episode three.

But I recognize that I'm pretty alone feeling that way. Many seems to struggle all the way up to the episode four sing along.

<TEXT> Yeah, same here. The Christmas special felt a *little* weak to me, but I'm sure this entire proper season will deliver.

Really glad the reviewer touched on how well the action is done, since that often seems to be overlooked. It really is remarkable when they come together to kick ass, drive cars, make bombs and all that other stuff. Hopefully they'll build up to those scenes though, just like in season one. I know many found it way too slow, but I think a good build up makes everything better.  </TEXT>

For instance (I was reminded of it because you mentioned Bates Motel) there's a doc called The Psycho Legacy that I was never able to find in any legal manner. At least there was no access to it where I live. Or I'm just dumb, that's not out of the question.

Anyway, I agree, there are definitely a lot of options. </TEXT>

I'm not saying there is no actual hotel, but I do think it's a good idea to keep an open mind. Sure it seems *unlikely* that something genuinely supernatural wasn't going on... but that doesn't mean something supernatural was going on.

I have no idea where they're going with this, but it wouldn't surprise me if it ends up more mundane than many might expect. They have kept their options open.

But really, she probably drank the water.

<TEXT> If no real effort is put into it, I will probably not watch it. That means it might be a fairly polished, pro product, but if it's just going through the motions and it's obvious no one involved cares, I'll probably consider it bad... even if it technically isn't. 

I'm thinking of something like those CSI shows or what have you.

I can forgive shows having bad elements, if there are good things in the middle of it all. An example could be Bates Motel, which is kind of all over the place with regards to its narrative and characters, but seems to genuinely be trying and the two lead actors put on one hell of a show.

Not sure if this makes any sense, but there you are. </TEXT>

That it is.

Another idea: some cross-cutting between wide shots of New York and Texas in order to show the scope of the show. Hell you could maybe even throw the cave woman in there to really show just how big they go. Unless of course you only want to tease with your back door plan, in that case you should probably mainly focus on season one. </TEXT>

I may be wrong about some of those, didn't actually look up the actors age.

Anyway, I get why they mostly don't do it for stuff with a predominant cast of high school kids. Makes everything a lot more difficult and complex. It's like that old saying about water, kids and animals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always enjoyed the comedic and horror aspects of Twin Peaks the most.

And you can call The Leftovers a lot, but a laugh riot it's not. It's not really scary either.

Tonally the shows feels very different to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People can watch movies however they want, but I don't think there's any doubt that many stories does not work as well if you already know either the entire story or parts beforehand. 

It's like knowing the punchline to a joke. Of course you can still enjoy it if it's well told, but never in the same way as you would have if you went in blind.

I watched Split recently. Someone in this sub had spoiled it for me. Not to be malicious, at least I don't think so, but they probably thought it didn't matter.

I can say with certainty that it would have been one of the best surprises of my entire movie going life if I hadn't known what I was told. It was still a good film, I enjoyed it, but it didn't kick me like it would have if I didn't knew where it was going.

Another example is the movie Green Room. saw it without knowing anything, checked the trailers afterwards, and if I had seen those it would have fundamentally changed my experience.

There is only one time you can experience something for the first time, but you can always rewatch, so I certainly don't seek out spoilers on purpose. I stay away from most trailers and plenty of pther marketing material as well. 

If I want that different experience knowing what's coming, I just see a film again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apparently there's some controversy with regards to whether the affliction is even a real thing or not. On top of that some see it as problematic to use it in fictional things like these because it might reinforce stereotypes.

I don't know about any of that, but I certainly felt it's used very well to tell a dramatic engaging story in both Bates Motel, Split and of course Psycho. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Can you convince me?

Not really. It just isn't a show that's going to appeal to everyone because it doesn't focus much on the things others of its kind does. It's about emotions and it shifts between genres all the time, sometimes it goes straight farce, the overall plot is secondary and it slows down all the time. It's a big messy colorful crazy thing.

But it certainly is positive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  What does Cinemax have to do to get more viewers? 

Good question.

I actually asked here once and the consensus seemed to be there way no way for them to do that since people just look at it like a shit channel based around softcore porn. Which is why I think it's sad they decided to have both The Knick and Quarry there when they could've taken them elsewhere. Guess they had their reasons though.

This show is like the perfect blend of these great pulpy elements and it's beautifully produced like any prestige show

Yep. I still can't believe not a single big site did weekly recaps of it, but guess they also just went along with the it's Cinemax so who cares thing. </TEXT>

Though to be fair, I don't actually know if I ever felt he really went away, since I haven't seen several of his very unpopular films like Last Airbender, The Happening and After Earth.

I'm thinking about giving them a shot though.

If you haven't seen The Visit btw, that one is also worth checking out. Even lower budget than Split, but solid little horror flick. </TEXT>

It's fine and dandy that people want representation and all that, but on occasion it seems to be less about good stories, interesting characters and visuals, the actual point, and a lot more about real world issues.

The 100 debacle is a good example of a case where no once seemed to care about the actual show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, if it's needed for whatever reason a  bigger budget would be okay. I just don't want to see the core of the show change fundamentally.

Previously he could do pretty much what he wanted because it was under the radar all things considered, now the world is watching.

I hope he would still The National Anthem in 2017 if he felt like it, but I honestly am not sure that's the case. </TEXT>

Except I'm not 100% sure Odenkirk's actions came from him being stupid. At least not at all of it. He seems just as much incapable of understanding the evil that is out there, especially when that evil is someone he's known his entire life. A sort of naivety more than just idiocy.

<TEXT> It was at least two things.

In the spirit of the time period, the late seventies were really big UFO times (the same reason they used split screen) and it was an homage to the Coen's and their odd sensibilities, The Man Who wasn't There specifically.

I thought it was a wonderful choice and it's not like it came out of nowhere. I could be wrong, but I believe every single episode had hints that aliens were actually flying around in Minnesota. Part of what kickstarts the entire Blumquist storyline was that Rye Gerhadt saw an UFO in episode one.

There may also be some thematic reasons, but I haven't quite figured that part out yet.

<TEXT>  All that beautiful tension though comes from the fact that I genuinely have no clue what is going to happen at any given moment on Fargo.

At times when they get really close to the Coen's filmography, I could see where the show was going... But then every time they did that, they also threw some little swerve in there to keep me on my toes. Like for instance when they did a riff on the "Look in your heart" scene from Miller's Crossing, or the two kidnappers in a cabin sequences from Fargo. 

It's always done respectfully, but also fresh. It's an impressive balancing act. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Obviously I won't recommend you go in expecting anything close to as good as Psycho, but as a belated sequel to an iconic film that has pretty much everything going against it, it does an okay job. 

Several scenes emulate Hitchcock's approach to suspense and there are also some very Hitchcockian camera work. 

Perkins is fantastic in the role that made him famous, but that didn't exactly surprise me. 

Solid little 80's thriller/horror film in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Watched it again last night and enjoyed it more than the first time around.

Even though I try not to, it can be hard to avoid the kind of mindset where you're trying to solve everything, but the second time around I didn't have that problem at all, I just let the crazy wash over me. 

Great imagery, creepy atmosphere and wonderful performances. I also loved how bombastic the soundtrack was.

Really liked it but how do you feel?

EDIT: This is for people who have seen the film, so watch out for SPOILERS! </TEXT>

<TEXT> http://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/black-mirrors-charlie-brooker-predicting-donald-trump-love-story/

A few quotes:

"We've got one that's overtly comic, much more overtly comic than anything we've done. It's got fairly mainstream comic elements, but also some really unpleasant stuff that happens. I haven't even seen the rough cut of it yet.

"Then, Jodie Foster's done one, that's more got the tone of an indie movie, an indie drama. There's a mother and daughter relationship in it.

"I do think that at the moment, as we're doing new episodes, there's a limit to how much constant nihilistic bleakness I can take. And the world is in a place at the moment where I think maybe people appreciate things that aren't so unremittingly horrible. But you also don't want to short-change people on the unremitting horribleness."

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm aware it's too late for a renewal, so it's not like it matters much, but I do think the show is fantastic and deserves to be seen anyway. 
Especially because it actually works as a single story, you aren't left hanging waiting for a conclusion that will never arrive.

It's about a guy who returns from the Vietnam war and gets involved with shady types.

It's a beautiful show, great cinematography, terrific music, with a contemplative tone mixed with extreme violence. For whatever reason, it really works. Also very solid period details, a fine sense of time of place.

Great characters, some of the best film making in *any* TV show (yes, that includes Miguel Sapochnik's work on GOT) and an interesting cool story about bad things happening to (bad) people. Yeah, you may have seen that kind of thing before, but never done quite like here.

In case anyone cares about behind the scenes stuff, all episodes are directed by Greg Yaitanes who worked on Banshee and several are written by a couple of guys who worked on Rectify...

Come to think of, that's actually a good way to pitch the show:

It's like Banshee and Rectify had a kid. Moody, evocative but also aggressively pulpy.

Ann Dowd is in it too.

Give it a shot.

<TEXT> I just came across The Raid on Netflix and it got me thinking I would actually prefer to rewatch the second one. I admire how simple and aggressive the first film is, but I also don't mind a bit of grandiose gangster stuff in between my ultra violence. 

I'm under the impression most people prefer the first one, but I could be wrong? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found this list very interesting:

http://decider.com/2017/01/03/netflix-movies-preview-2017/

Some very big names and talented people involved in all those films. Certainly doesn't smell like TV movies.

Are they going for global domination? Is cinema really going to die? What movies are you looking forward to the most? 
How much do I have to write in order to be able to post this list, which is really all I wanted to? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not *great* or anything like that, the plot seems to mainly just be an excuse for the characters to do their thing, but it is pretty funny in a vulgar way (think Misfits) and I found both leads likeable and not once was I bored. Solid cinematography too and some okay music.

So, yeah, if you have watched all the superb prestigious stuff out there and isn't feeling like learning about union problems in Baltimore or meth cooking right now, but you're just looking for a little British show about people  hunting monsters and pissing on each other (literally) while swearing a lot, this could do the trick. 

Or it might not, can't say for sure, but it worked for me. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-11-28 21:08:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I got it from winzip I guess. Apparently not a good program, or maybe it was fake, don't know.

I have deleted the program, I ran malwarebytes, deleted some more after that and then ran avast just to be sure. Then I went to registry edit and deleted a bunch of stuff, but that's where I ran into a problem. There's one thing left, it's called REG_SZ and can not be deleted no matter how many times I restart and try. 
Then I went into the C drive and found something called chromium_test_page that I also can't delete, it keep on telling me I'm not the administrator. 

Am I fucked, or is there a way to fix this?

Btw, I did look at getting Hitman pro besides the other stuff because it's recommended in this sub, but some reviews scared me away. I already have enough problems.

And as you maybe can tell, I know nothing about computers. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-11-24 22:44:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have now seen The Knick, Banshee and Quarry and enjoyed all three a lot, but I can't help notice they aren't exactly the most buzzed about TV out there. Almost feels like most people aren't even aware they exist. They don't get much coverage on entertainment sites either, at least compared to other stuff out there.

Is it just that Cinemax isn't a strong brand? Or don't they really promote their own shows for whatever reason?

Just seems odd considering how much TV shows have become a major part of the cultural zeitgeist. Especially weird when it's shows that push the envelope of just how much of a contender to cinema TV can be.

Other than that I guess the two shows don't have much in common... except maybe a melancholic tone.

So yeah, that's it. Now excuse me while I got back to my 70s hitman. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are some movies where one single aspect dragged the film down for you? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-11 20:05:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I watched Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome again yesterday. 
It's a film with a bunch of problems, but I can sort of live with those. What I can't live with is Maurice Jarre's music.

I'm aware he's made great stuff and all that, I'm also not inherently againts an old school orchestral approach, nor do I think underlining the action is always bad... but the music just won't stop! Ever. 
The entire film is slathered with music and the underlining is often borderline Mickey Mousing. Just give it a break, just a few minutes. But no, it just keeps going. There's also no unity to, it goes from Williamesque adventure music to aggresively pounding drums to whatever suits the scene, but never becomes a coherent vison. 

Some of the blame should probably go to the two directors as well, because apparently they never thought of getting rid of any of it. 

I generally go along with whatever soundscape or musical approach the film makers has decided on, but this was one of the few times where I simply couldn't do that and in the end it really took away from my experience.

Yeah, that was a rant I guess...

Anyway, what are some single elements that you feel almost managed to ruin an entire movie for you? Can be anything. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Do you think Black Mirror has sold out? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-28 18:05:34 </DATE>

<TEXT> Season three brought us plenty of American money, but not just that, we also got American talent. 

Behind the camera we got Hollywood composers and directors, in front we got Hollywood actors, two of which are kind of Hollywood dynasty. Actually one of the new writers is royalty as well.

For a while there's been a heavy 80's nostalgia brewing, indie wise with stuff like Beyond the Black Rainbow, The Guest and It Follows, more mainstream with Drive. And finally *extremely* mainstream with Stranger Things, which btw is also funded by Netflix. 
Black Mirror season three took that ball and ran with it, complete with pop songs and The Lost Boys poster, in a way that appeals very, very much to a certain subset of internet users who are very effective as free marketing. 

That episode also delivered what could be seen as a happy ending. As did the first actually, kind of. Happy-ish is maybe more suitable.

No one fucked any farm animals this time around. None of those provocative shenanigans. 
I suspect that bit in the original Black Mirror may have turned some people off, if only a tad.

We also got what I presume is the most popular tv genre in the world, the police procedural. 1 1/2 hours of that is what we got, to be precise.

All in all, do you think the show has changed fundamentally, sold out, and if so, for better or worse?

Brooker got very meta jokey about it before, but has he *truly* become...

<TITLE> I think San Junipero might have been inspired by the so-called Cinma du look </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-27 09:58:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was reminded of the poster to Betty Blue during the episode:

http://i.imgur.com/VqIUmLW.jpg

A poster that likely was a whole lot more popular than the actual film, lots of people had it on their wall yet they hadn't seen the film, but that's neither here nor there.

I got me thinking about Luc Besson and such though and their slick late 80's fashion photography neon look. ric Serra's music came to mind as well.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I would not be surprised if the people involved in the actual production took a look at those films (besides obvious ones like The Lost Boys).

Here's wikipedia's take on Cinma du look:

"It referred to films that had a slick, gorgeous visual style and a focus on young, alienated characters who were said to represent the marginalized youth of Franois Mitterrand's France. Themes that run through many of their films include doomed love affairs, young people more affiliated to peer groups rather than families, a cynical view of the police, and the use of scenes in the Paris Mtro to symbolise an alternative, underground society."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cin%C3%A9ma_du_look

Obviously the episode has nothing to do Mitterrand or whatever, but I still think they may have been inspired stylistically.

Thoughts?

<TEXT> ... Jesus tap dancing Christ that was so much better than I had ever expected! 

Maybe it's because the word I had most often heard mentioned in relation to this book was boring, I came in with kind of low expectations, but I don't think it's just that, I also just think it's a really good book. Great characters, including some loathsome badguys, a beautifully realized specific world, very likeable heroes, a sweet love story and a very strong plot. 
I felt it all came together at the end where it also became, if I may be a little kid for a moment, *totally fucking badass*! The moment where the three boy gunslingers finally does their thing, practically leapt of the page for me and I couldn't get enough of the glorious killers finally released. It was immensely satisfying.

But then of course, that was soon followed by Charyou Tree... 

King you bastard, why do you have to put something  in my eye.

I can see why maybe the flashback thing could have been very disappointing for people who had been waiting years for the book back when it was released, but for me it was a great joy to visit this specific time and place and follow those characters. So much so the return to our Ka-tet almost felt a little odd. 

Don't get me wrong, still looking forward to reading the next book, but I am really going to miss Mejis.

So yeah, just wanted to gush a little about a book I didn't expect that much from. And mention that Rhea is one disgusting, scary old witch. Screw that old bitch to hell and back.

Wolves of Calla better bring it.

Neither film is *exactly* like Stranger Things, but they both share vibes and ideas and are strong films. 

Midnight Special is obviously not an inspiration, but it does go to the same well as ST (Spielberg), only in a less commercial way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a comic written by Joe Hill (son of Stephen King, which he probably hates is always mentioned) and the artwork is by Gabriel Rodriguez.

It's about a family who after a tragedy decides to move back to their ancestral home, Keyhouse. The house is located in the town of Lovecraft (indeed), in Massachusetts. Soon the kids discover something is not quite right about the old house, lots of mysterious things going, evil might be lurking and before you know it the family faces all manner of dangers.

Despite the many creative supernatural ideas (there's quite a bit of mythology/backstory slowly revealed), Hill remembers to keep the characters in focus and the plot moving towards a solid ending. The villain is also a formidable scary opponent.

There's six volumes and that's it, no going on forever, all strong and beutifully done.

It's a lot more brutal and gory than Stranger Things though, but the spirit is in many ways the same. 
Maybe it's because we see a lot of it from the perspective of kids and teens. Maybe it's the small town setting and the sense of cosmic horror. Maybe it's a like father like son thing. Maybe it's just that both are awesome...

You might not think comics are your kind of thing... But you might also be wrong. You won't know until you've tried.

<TEXT> I have completed all the story missions except for Extreme Sahelanthropus. It would seem I have gotten the ending and I'd really rather not spend any time on that mission if I don't have to, but seeing as it's a MGS game I should probably ask if there's any point in beating that mission?

If there is a point, I'd rather not know what it is specifically. Just want to know if there's any reason besides ticking of the box? </TEXT>

<TITLE> A few technical questions about The Hateful Eight </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-13 12:48:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I noticed that during the stagecoach scenes the film breaks the 180 degree rule. In the early scenes it's not that noticeable, but it is there. At other times it was very overt (it goes back and forth several times during the Four Passengers chapter). I'm curious if anyone has any theories why? Could be no specific reason, maybe him and his editor just thought it felt right, but considering how aggressive it was during that later chapter I did wonder.

Later in the film I was reminded of De Palma, probably the music and the slowmo, but that did made me notice the deep focus and I'm curios if anyone knows if they used the split diopter at some points? If so, do you think this was a deliberate homage or just happened to work well with the very wide image?

And then I'm wondering if the shots that are from the sets but where you can see the outside, are done with modern type green screen or if they used a different older technique? Certainly didn't look green screen to me, so I was thinking maybe back projection or something?

Maybe these questions aren't so truefilm suitable, I don't know. I guess to make them so, I'll ask if the deliberate artificiality that's always part of Tarantino's movies, detracts from his stories or makes them better and more interesting to you?

I don't know much about film tech stuff, so feel free to correct me left and right if I said anything completely wrong.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about the Dark Tower series </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-11 01:14:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I read the three first books several years ago, so I don't really remember a lot of details, just sort of the overall plot (there's this guy Roland and stuff). For whatever reason I wasn't able to get through the fourth one, it was very different from the others, things got in the way... and I sort of forgot about it. 

Now I want to get back into the series, but I'm curious if I can just pick up the fourth book and get what's going on, or if the series is way to complex and I won't be able to understand anything?

I don't feel like reading the first three again, though I enjoyed them a lot, but would like to continue with the series. Is my limited recollection good enough, or do I need to go back to the beginning?

Hopefully this doesn't break any subreddit rules, wasn't really sure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Solid old school style Hollywood film making, but with all that modern technology can bring to flesh out the world. 

Anthony Dod Mantle does amazing work. There's a wonderful tactile feel to the many close ups of oil, ropes, ink, blood and what have you. It never becomes a shakycam orgy, but seemingly often handheld shots, or tiny cameras strapped on to objects, really sell the experience of being on board a ship as much as the more classic wide shots do. Hope he gets some sort of recognition for what he's accomplished here.

The cast is excellent down to the smallest part. Most have very little time to establish characters(the focus is obviously on the leads), which is why it's so good they're all distinct looking highly competent actors. 

I loved every minute of it and it reminded me why it's so much fun to see films on the big screen that doesn't involve capes or cars crashing. I'm certainly guilty of often seeing those kinds of films in the theater and it was delightful to see a film that doesn't skimp on set pieces (at all), but still took its time and didn't rush ahead afraid that people will get bored. When the big brute does arrive, it's truly awe inspiring and the drama goes to 11 in no time

I'm sure it won't do all that well, sadly. For one thing it won't appeal to hardcore arthouse lovers, but on the other hand, it's also not a total popcorn muncher. It's not an incredibly sexy subject matter either (whales, we all now how they bring in the big bucks) and everything right now is about leo, QT and that space opera, but it is well worth seeking out if you're "just" looking for a very, very competent, well acted, beautifully made story about man vs nature, with that guy who plays Thor. 

Also, Brendan Gleeson should be in *all* movies. Seriously.

Yeah, I fucking enjoyed the hell out of it, sorry about the rambling. </TEXT>

So I was wondering if it's one of those better left alone as a good but foggy memory films, or if it's a genuinely worthwhile movie worth seeing again?

<TEXT> I'm not necessarily looking for anything deeply profound. It doesn't have to be Synedoche New York or 2001. 

Trance was undoubtedly a little silly with the whole hynotism thing, but I'm okay with that, as long as it keeps the twists and mindfuckery going. Bonus points if it's super stylish.

It's hard to explain exactly what I'm looking for, but something like Memento, Cypher, Primer, Enemy, Inception, Triangle, Mulholland Drive... 

You know, mind-benders. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seriously. There's even a scene to rival the Langley scene.

The film is suspenseful, intense (at one point the entire audience gasped in unison), very funny (Simon Peg is great) and the action is spectacular. 

The Cruise misil can not be stopped. Not should he be when he delivers entertainment like this.

Bring on the next one. </TEXT>

*"For the last year, very much under the radar, I've been working with
two film makers who have created some of the biggest SF movies in the
last twenty years on a television project. (I can't reveal their
identities, but pick any three of their movies and you have box office
of over two billion dollars.)"*

*"On the TV project I co-wrote and would produce with the two mega-film
makers (henceforth just "the group")"*

*"The up-side of the project was that everyone agreed that they had
never seen anything like it before. The down-side was that they had
never seen anything like it before."* </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's likely not a film that would work for most Sense8 fans if you expect Sense8 or Cloud Atlas. It's nothing like those. 

But if you want to get an insight into where these creators come from, what their aesthetic ideals are, how they want to explore and subvert genre and what sort of themes they want to illuminate, it's definitely worth watching.

Also, it's just a badass entertaining little crime thriller.

<TEXT> It's directed by Tom Tykwer and The Wachowski, all three of which are behind Sense8. It's a huge, ambitious, exuberant, sprawling science fiction opus that tells a bunch of stories from different times and different places. Like in Sense8 the stories are all intercut.

Here's the trailer:

<TITLE> I'm looking for something easy and cheap so I can listen to audiobooks at work. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-07 08:36:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've thought about getting an ipod shuffle, mainly because it's apparently not that expensive, but I also don't know anything about things like this, so it might not be the best option. The shuffle thing seems like it could be a problem. I'm tech illiterate (don't even use itunes), so if that's the case, it wouldn't be good.

It should also not be something bulky or fragile. I move around a lot at work and never sit down. It doesn't have to be an ipod, it's just the one thing I've heard about.

Got any recommendations?

Hopefully you fine folks can help me. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-04-04 03:26:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I almost couldn't handle it when the people next to me drank beer and booze. At one point I felt like just taking their beers out of their hands and drink it all right there and then, to hell with it. I also got so annoyed they didn't drank everything, like "what the hell is wrong with people, why aren't you all getting fucked up?"

The family gatherings aren't terrible, sure lots of people have it worse, but it truly hit me how little control I have when alcohol is placed right in front of me and I just have to sit there. My mind turns into mush. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Non-English readers, do you prefer to read English language books in their original form, or translated? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-01 21:48:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I would read them all in English if I felt I had a good enough grasp of the language, but often I don't feel that way and end up reading a translated version. On the one hand that's great, because I don't miss out on things or misunderstand anything, on the other hand I do feel I get a somewhat diluted version. I get nuances I might have missed, but I probably miss nuances that simply can't be translated too. It's a dilemma.

I guess this question isn't really exclusively about English, I just picked that one because it's the only other language I *sort of* understand. So, whatever language we're talking about, do you prefer to read a version translated into you own language, or the original version?

I'm reading a translated Terry Pratchett book btw, my first book by him, that's what got me thinking about this. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [question] How come now one plays this particular game legit/without cheating/glitching? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-22 06:51:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Is it something particular about this game that makes everyone cheat? I've noticed it's so common that even mentioning the idea of playing the game for real during raids is kinda frowned upon. Or at least people considered you odd.

I get that people want to level up, but everyone does it, even people who are already level 32 and have done the raids many, many times.

Am I just old and not "with it"? I wouldn't be surprised. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't made it all the way through in one go. Played up to Atheon once on hard and just now I was invited to a game that started with Atheon on normal. Finished it. Figured finally being part of beating it would make the damn blinking stop, but it didn't. Do you have to be the fireteam leader? Do you need to do it in one go? Am I stupid? Feel free not to answer my last question. </TEXT>
