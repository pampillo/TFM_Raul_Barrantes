<TEXT> It's not a scam at all. The schools are accredited and seen as reputable places for education by employers, and other institutions. 

An educated society has value, but the price individuals affix to a college education is truly subjective. Some feel that the blue collar route is the better path, while others feel attending college is of utmost importance. 

As citizens, we should not be manipulated by the narrative that college education is close to mandatory. Unfortunately, since most employers require college degrees for a large amount of roles...it puts many people in a tough situation.  There are people without college degrees, who are far more intelligent than some college students. However, the proliferation of the inherent value of education causes people to attend college, (NOT because they want to, but because they are pressured to).  

Blue collar workers are needed. If college isn't interesting, then a trade school should be a viable option. It's just a different form of education, a more hands-on type. 

The for-profit schools are really messed up because they seek to exploit people that are sold on this narrative. However, they (students of Strayer, UPO, etc.) are unaware of the reputation and accreditation of those schools in the eyes of employers. 

Institutions know the narrative is important to their existence. College Tuition/Fees will continue to rise as long as college admins, officials and coaches are making money to pad their lavish lifestyles. If colleges didn't operate like businesses, they would not make any money.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't worry. Most people who have active friend circles will be at more of a loss than you. After all, they peaked in college and will see real life as just obligations. 

Instead, you'll graduate and move onto new things; a fresh start. You'll have chances to branch out outside of the Rutgers Bubble and make connections. If social anxiety is getting you down, seek help now, so you can enjoy life the way you would like to.  

Remember, it's going to be mother's day on Sunday. Most people will be sitting with a few friends or by themselves. Many students will be with their families pre and post graduation (Sunday). 

Be proud.  Half the people taking pics together will eventually get busy with life and lose touch with each other...(especially if those friendly connections were formed through drinking/partying/shananigans etc.)

Behind all the picture taking is a repressed fear of the real world for some, especially if he or she is swamped with student loan debt. Re-frame your situation if possible and look at all the positives to your college experience. There are many people who may or may not have done as well as you. 

Also, you do have friends, you just have to reach out to them and show interest. People won't know if you value their company unless you verbally tell them.  

I wish you well!

<TEXT> University Coaches are grossly overpaid due to a systematic failure. The "Institutions" of Higher Education have become drunk off of athletic departments - serving as the main brand promoter for their school. 

By definition, college is an institution....but if it wasn't a business, why would college's invest so much money in branding and other lavish accommodations? (Because they want more students to come to their school instead of other schools. Each student is a walking $. 

The entire "College" Narrative is something that is proliferated through the masses of our society. WHY? Because you'll be at the mercy of the (1%) for a significant portion of your life (time range for paying off debt is a case by case basis.) The people in control have control of you, to an extent. 

Think about it. If college wasn't a business or a racket, why would schools try to squeeze every last penny out of you before graduation?

Universities get paid for dispersing x number of gov loans to students...of course the school is going to provide you with some form of "financial aid." 

Also, I'm not out of touch. I understand both sides of the argument and why college keeps getting more expensive. It's a systematic failure that exploits students and it's not going to stop. The gov, admins and other college officials are making far too much money to make changes to benefit students financially.

<TEXT> Great Point! 

Institutions know that student loans are easily obtained. Therefore, they continue to raise tuition/fees in small percentages each year...thinking, ehhh they won't mind if it's just a little bit more. College is College and most are pressured to go to college in search of a better life.  

SOLUTION: 

* Minimize the bloated salaries of state workers at Rutgers

* cut the overlap in jobs (bureaucracy)   minimize the administration

* Students should find another way to go to college and NOT sign their lives away in loans

* Students can take-up part time jobs while in school

* "Following your passion" in Art History, Music, or any other major with minimal potential for employment is not practical.

* College is a Business. Treat it like one. As a student, bust your ass in class. There are financial aid awards/scholarships for continuing students.

* Commute to Rutgers for Freshmen/Soph, if possible. Don't waste your money on shitty food and housing. You won't be eligible for the nice on-campus anyway.

* Be smart with your money and the decisions that you make.

<TEXT> In terms of programs, RBS is not THAT highly regarded. Most of RBS's image and reputation is due to the close proximity of NYC. Therefore, it's easier for recruiters to come to campus and recruit for their respective companies.  Many RBS alumni have positions with many top financial firms. Yet, Those companies come to Rutgers to recruit the ABSOLUTE best in the class. Remember, there are many other business schools who are recruited as much or more than RBS. 

However, college is college. Pick the best school for your situation. Financially, you will have to pay one way or another. Don't bank on Rutgers close proximity to NYC as a true selling point. This is because there are a lot of variables involved to achieve a job in NYC. If you are determined to be in NYC, then consider Rutgers. There are no guarantees to anything, though. 

There are a lot of opportunities b/c of NYC, BUT you have to do everything within your control to put yourself in a position for consideration.   

RBS has a ton of programs that help with connections and networking events for RBS students only. Again, it's still a gamble because sometimes it's being at the right place at the right time.  

If you're in-state (Illinois), attend Illinois do well and do whatever you can to network.  You'll be much happier knowing that your debt (if any) is more manageable than paying more for a similar education and for other so-called selling points that may not be there for you.  

In other words, consider all the factors that are within your control when choosing either Rutgers or Illinois-Urbana/Champaign. 

The factors out of your control have the potential to mislead you. Generally, the high performing, well connected students at RU have a higher probability to work in NYC. Intern, Intern, Intern. Fall, Spring and Summer. It's the main way to stay connected to employers in the area and gain experience.  It def helps with the competition for jobs as so many students from the Tri-State area target NYC with employment aspirations. 

Good Luck!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some are ignorant and think it's not normal for people to attend college outside of the range of 18-24. Also, if you didn't attend Rutgers from Freshman year on....some people seem to think that social openness concludes after their 1st year. 

Many RU students attend the school as 1st years on and don't understand the fact that life happens...  I have friends who were in the same position as you.  There are a lot of rich, stuck up brats who think their shit doesn't stink.  They've lived inside a bubble and have been coddled by their parents.  Therefore, when they see older students in their classes, the lack of knowledge of the real world shows. If you have become the object of derision, don't take it personal...it's a bunch of misguided "adults" with minimal real-world experience. It's a lack of understanding that it's never to late to attend college nor is it shameful to have a gap in education.  Their responsibilities and priority structures are much different, too.  

If you come to class, then leave after its over to work part-time, take care of family, etc....it's not something these students are aware of.  Many times these students will have plans after leaving class....and those plans do not include raising a family or returning home to do adult things. Rather, those plans include getting drunk on Fireball and fucking like jack rabbits.

I wouldn't worry too much. Tell them to buddy up and back stroke it. Also, ask them how it feels to have signed their lives away for the next 30 years (Loans).

Imagine making loan payments for the first 5-6 years, which only goes towards paying down interest. Then, it will take 5+ years to pay back the principal. (Just estimates, but in general it takes a while to pay off loans) </TEXT>

<TEXT> RU is largely an in-state school. There are not many out of state students here. I'd say 1 in every 15 or so...although just an estimate. Since NJ is so small, most people that attend RU know people here already and it can get VERY cliquey VERY fast. Your best bet is to save money and stay in state. I'm sure HOFSTRA has clubs and activities as well. In your post, you basically answered your own question. I know it's a tough decision, but if HOFSTRA is giving you more money and you already know people there....that's the best decision. Not only is it in-state, but if something happens and you need to return home...it's less of loss b/c you'll already be close to home. 

The CS department is good, but it's not worth paying $37,000+ for an out of state public school.  

Good Luck!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Greek Life at every school has an element of racism or ignorance. It is very vain and superficial. Looks matter a lot depending on the sorority/fraternity. Some want to promote their image on campus, therefore, they will purposely select people who are physically appealing...while others may be focused on level of involvement.  

Ratio is mostly a Rutgers creation. It's a self-constructed way to commoditize the social-oriented girls on campus. If its their residence, they can choose to let people in or not at their discretion. 

The elitist attitude is definitely true. It all depends on what fraternity/sorority. Generally, the girls/guys who post a lot on Instagram represent the superficial ones. The number of "Likes" and self promotion of their weekly events is important to them, too. 

I wouldn't get all caught up in that as it does not represent true reality. Hot white chicks exist everywhere. Just because you see something on Instagram does not mean it's reality. People can pick and choose the pictures taken...edit them, and post only the pics they want to show the public. What you don't see is what is actually happening in reality. 

As a HS senior just relax and look forward to doing well in school.  The best advice I could give you is this...If you do well in college, it can open a lot of doors. Partying is a lot of fun, but it doesn't help you progress. Focus on doing well, landing a good job...and then you can do all the damn partying you want. Not to mention, smart girls...regardless of race will be more attracted to you do to success. 

Just be yourself and don't let social media/social environments dictate your progression as a person.

It happened to me. I was upgraded to the Discover More Card and given a $2500 limit.  

The key is to pay all your balances on time and in FULL. To get started, purposely use the card on one or two high amount items that can easily be paid off.  

Ex. A printer for school ~ $100, a pair of shoes ~ $85

To build great credit, keep your balances stabilized. Do not carry high balances.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They saved a ton food that was being thrown out....The tray move was to boost profit. Remember, if you have a meal plan you're paying well above what the food was bought for wholesale. Rutgers found a way to make more profit off the meal plan by minimizing the amount of food procured for the student population.  Therefore, they can charge just as much and go through less food. That's an increase in profit. Also, they found that the dishwashers used to clean the trays was another expense they could cut along with employees needed to clean the trays. Again, more profit.

Barchi is not a president. He's a politician, a coward and hired the train wreck Julie Hermann. Please take note. He failed big time with that move.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is hope. Fortunately, there are people who were admitted to Rutgers, but for reasons decide to decline the admission. (Safety School, No Financial Aid, Accepted to Top Choice, etc...)  All schools accept more than they can house due to the fact that students do decline admission. Just be patient, there is always a chance to be admitted from the waitlist. Also, you can enroll at a community college and then transfer into SAS (on terms that you fulfilled articulation agreements of the associate's degree.  If you choose this route, you can lessen the weight of the SAT score and HS GPA. Rutgers offers transfer scholarships for top performers in CC in state). 

Don't worry you have options if things don't work out with Rutgers. I' m sure you've applied other places as well. 

Good Luck! (Don't wait around for them, though.) </TEXT>

Yes, MS-13 exists as do the Bloods. These gangs have affiliated members in and around the NB area.

<TEXT> Good stuff. If you want the party scene Myrtle Beach has a place called Broadway at the Beach. There are bars, clubs, and restaurants all in one area. 

Usually, Broadway at the Beach is the main hangout for college spring breakers because of the proximity of all the bars and clubs. They may still offer pay one price wristband to club and bar hop, but I'm not sure.  A lot of Coastal Carolina students.

North Myrtle Beach is the safer part, along with Cherry Grove Beach.  

Just a few tips: Like anywhere else, if you look for trouble...you'll find it. Stay away from Socastee, downtown Myrtle Beach (a little past the ferris wheel) and Atlantic Beach (at night). If you see groups of bikers, let them be and DO NOT tailgate, yell or "disrespect" them. These are real biker gangs that travel to Myrtle for conventions and so-called bike weeks. Last time I was there, they took the area over and flaunted their presence at every turn. MB has bike week, let's hope it's not during spring break. lol 

Traveling is easy. There are two main routes up and down the area. 
Use 17 Local for access to all the stores and beach access via Ocean Blvd (This route has a ton of lights, if you do not want to sit in traffic, use 31 Carolina Bays Pkwy, to cut your commute from one end of Myrtle to the other.

Use 501 to go inland. There is a huge outlet center off of 501, going towards Conway.  Conway is home to Coastal Carolina, but don't expect a huge campus presence as it is a commuter campus. Literally, one road by Horry-Georgetown Technical College leads you to the campus. 

Also, remember this is South Carolina. People are friendly, but if you treat them rudely, they'll let you know about it. lol And as a side note, many people have fire-arm permits. Do not act like a drunken dick to people while driving. lol SC has lax gun laws which allow gun owners to conceal carry as long as the firearm is concealed in a locked compartment in the vehicle. The "Jersey attitude" does not fly down there. I say this not to scare you, but to be cognizant of the environment you're in. 

CHARLESTON - one of the oldest cities in the country. True southern hospitality. Fun place to be, beaches are there, too. College of Charleston is 70% girls as their are no shortage of southern belles walking around.  For the ladies, there is a ton of shopping. 

Spring Break is supposed to be fun. So get fucked up, try to spell your name correctly, and get home safe so your family can watch you graduate! 

Safe travels! Good Luck!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone that I've been around acts like it's competitive. Plus, a lot of them tell me how RBS is kind of annoying because there are so many students with elitist type attitudes. 

Plus, RBS gets all special events and such, most of the students in other schools do not get receive the same opportunities. Right there is a sign that RBS is favored over all of the other schools. IF the classes are that bad, why would they be given special treatment? The reputation is sort of inflated, then. The proximity to NYC gives them a big boost, but if it wasn't for that....go figure. 

I'd say Math, Comp Sci, Bio, Chem, and Engineering...are the real tough ones.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> A simple search of google would yield many PDF versions. The administration tells professors to push for the newest versions of all textbooks. I've had professors go against that. They've flat out told us to download last year's edition of the text in pdf. That's the real way to save money. All the information is the same...well, usually. Sometimes, the chapters are switched around or minimal content added. 

TL:DR The result is still the same.....an older version can be obtained for free online via a simple Google search. Webassign, Cengage, Pearson and all the other HW portals suck, too. They can go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> History has a tendency to repeat itself. It sucks. And you're correct that narrative holds true through out all generations. The one thing that seems to be different is how much power and influence the media has on the formulation of thought. The formulation of organic thought is tough, especially, when the media (all sides) tries to manipulate the formulation of thought. 

A new generation has been exposed to the internet, social media, and smartphones since birth....while we may be repeating the process as humans, something is surprisingly different about the way people internalize information.  Manipulation of the masses is a real concept. Everytime we see people flip out on social media and spew anger everywhere...that's a new way of how we deal with information. We express ourselves more openly and have more platforms do so.   Overall there will always be problems created by another generation that will be left for future generations (to solve). 

Every administration has people who resign and do questionable shit. It boils down to what people view as more convenient to their interests and priorities. 

data might be beautiful, but there also many ways to fudge the numbers, omit information, and make correlations that don't inherently infer causation.  </TEXT>

I hate to see all of the infighting in this country....and sadly enough, I think people get their rocks off by seeing it happen. Confirmation bias is absolutely present on both sides, but when are people going to realize that constant fighting isn't going to solve anything. It's only going to mess the country up for future generations.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The media has a huge presence in this country. And if the media outlets could have full control over the US, they would do it in a heartbeat. Sadly enough, many millennials believe a lot of opinion pieces crafted by spin doctors (This goes both ways). 

Here are two examples of president's and their impeachments: 

Richard Nixon - Watergate: Several campaign officials from the RNC broke into DNC headquarters and stole documents...to try to dig up dirt on their political opponents.

Bill Clinton (Husband of Hillary Clinton) - Had sexual relations with a Whitehouse intern named Monica Lewinsky. Finger-banged her with a cigar in the Oval Office and lied under oath about it (perjury).  He was impeached, but remained in office. However, he was disbarred and could no longer practice law. 

Simply put, many millennials don't know what it takes to get impeached. The media hopes Trump will get impeached, which is why the term is being thrown around. 

The days of organic thought are over. It's extremely hard to locate the facts and ONLY the facts without someone giving their analysis on them. 

EDIT: Thank you fellow reddit user. Nixon was not impeached, but would have been if he didn't resign. His actions proved to be an action that was considered an impeachable offense.

<TEXT> A bachelor's degree is NOT an investment. There are so many people attending college now that it's significantly de-valued. Equal to a HS diploma or a just a tad higher. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No way. Cornell is the easiest Ivy league school to get into. HOWEVER, it is known to have the toughest curriculum out of all the ivies. There is a gorge that is connected by bridges near campus. Yearly, students jump up off the cliff. The place is a pressure cooker. Rutgers is a good school, but doesn't belong in the same category in terms of difficulty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Take the full ride. Pay yourself first. No debt is a good thing. Don't gamble against uncertainty. There are no guarantees of landing lucrative internships or a big payday after graduation. It can definitely happen though. If you'd like to cut down the price, commute to Rutgers (if possible). Do whatever you can to help yourself graduate with the least amount of debt possible.  I have friends who graduated with over 50K of debt because they banked on Rutgers having all the connections and opportunities. When things didn't work out....they still had to pay back the debt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Throw everything you have at the debt, except the amount that allows you to live with necessities.  Don't let the interest have a chance to accrue. You'll have plenty of time to enjoy your life. Would you rather have a black cloud hanging over your head for a shorter or longer amount of time. Work hard while you're young, so you can pay it off. 

Most that are traveling, driving around with nice cars and such are just prolonging the inevitable....payments, debt, and loan repayments. It's why leasing enables people to drive cars they truly cannot afford. Reframe things and realize how fortunate you are to be a physician. That alone is an accomplishment. 

Try to consolidate the debt (if federal loans) and make more than the minimum payments each month. Even if you were to make standard payments, your still going to face the undesirable debt obligation. Therefore, again....it's best to sacrifice now and enjoy being debt free...instead of living a large portion of your life paying other people before yourself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think most people in higher ed are a bit misguided. They try their best to latch on or associate themselves with the fame of notable figures in our society. While it's a cool tidbit of info, nobody really focuses on where you went to college unless you become famous. Then everyone wants to use your notoriety to increase the PR and marketability of the said school.

The sequence of events and link to the presidency is a bit of a stretch, though. "Almost" a US president is not an accomplishment. lol

<TEXT> Of course fraternities haze. Sororities do as well. Hazing is "illegal," but it still happens. Brothers are sworn to a code of secrecy not to go against the brotherhood and reveal the "process." Social pressure keeps people from revealing the truth. It's a well known thing amongst greek life and anyone who tells you it doesn't happen...is an ignorant lemming. 

As for girls, Sororities will haze the $hit out of you. Specifically, the well known ones. Ever heard of Gamma Phi Beta, Phi Sigma Sigma, and Zeta Tau Alpha? Never met so many girls with such low self esteem in my life. The hazing process mentally destroys them. It's sad to see. 

It's all about what you want, though. What are you willing to give up to be part of it.  And before anyone comments, that I didn't get a bid...I was part of Greek Life while at Rutgers.  </TEXT>
