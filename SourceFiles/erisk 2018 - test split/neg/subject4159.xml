<TITLE> The Pigeon </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Friday evening, I was off work this day and without anything to do in this boring town i'm acclaimed in my sanctuary. Confided with my computer, focused on the monitor as i'm consumed by the game in front of me. Everything else was white noise, although everything around the house is usually white noise.


"Alright that's enough Bob!"


The shriek of my mom came from across the house. Her voice gave me an instinctive feeling that made me want my ears to curl inside themselves and squeeze the pressure out of my head. The game was perforated as a second party to my old found focus. My mom is my everything.


I heard the door headed to the garage slam. She was walking out from the bedroom bathroom when I met her at the opening of her door. 

"Hi pumpkin!" as if the shrilling hadn't occurred.

"Hey mom, what was that all about?"

"Oh dad being dad."
They've been together for 35 years, and I guess she's gotten used to all of the arguing. It's always Dad is right, and Mom is wrong. But right isn't always the end all be all.

"He's got to go out of town for the week so it's just me and you. Do you want McDonalds?"
Dad usually cooks, so when he's out of town, it means my Mom doesn't have to cook, because she doesn't like to.

"Sure." I remarked, I've never really had a preference to food. If it tastes good i'll eat it.
"Alright you go get it." She said smiling biting her tongue.


As I was walking to my car I got a phone call.

"Hey buddy how's it going?"

"Hey Dad. What's up?"

"Hey, so I want you to know that i'll be gone for a week and I can trust you to take care of Mom right?"

"Yeah of course."

"Thanks buddy, I always feel a lot better when I know you're going to be there to take care of her." (Although she takes care of me)

"Yup no problem."

"So what are you doing?"

"Oh i'm going to go pick up some burgers at McDonalds for me and Mom."
I could hear him hiss at my response.

"Alright, well I got to go i'm about to get on my flight. Bye buddy."

"See ya Dad."

I backed out my car and the pigeons that like to hang out on the power line took off as if they left with me.


My mom usually goes to bed around 8:00 when my Dad is home but stays up later watching T.V when he's gone, so the night is shorter and I had some games to play. I lost my first game, it took 30 minutes to play. I was seething, mad at my teammates for costing me the game. *HOOOOF*


I started to get a headache, so I opened my window to get some fresh air. *HOOOOOOOOF*
*What?*, this sound was not coming from outside. It felt as if a Pigeon was behind me. It was dark, only the computer monitor to illuminate the room. I turned around immediately. Eyes need time to adjust in the dark, so there was nothing to see. Peering at the spot of origin I walked closer. The light from the computer monitor started to narrow, fading as if being sucked into the corner of my eye where I can notice my iris, a webbing of black. Nothing. There was nothing in my closet. 

*HOOOOOOOF!*

My heart nearly jumped out of my chest. I could hear footsteps coming from across the house. They came closer and closer to my room.

"Jared?"

"Mom?"

She opened my door and walked in.

"Did you hear that mom?"

She was baffled. The expression I could make out on her face changed to scared to manic. She began to cry.

"Mom?"

"You heard that too?"

"Yeah, there's a pigeon in the house."

"No son."

She got down on her knees in her night gown and wept more.
The room became deafening. I tried to ignore the ringing in my ears. So much noise, but through it, I could hear the pigeon. It became more frantic now. Howling consecutively, my ears could bleed. I looked to my mom. She lay down on the floor, blood pouring from the gun shot. *How could she do thi...* 
*HOOOOOOOOOOF!*


I screamed. The pigeon was too loud to ignore, it took me to my knees. My stomach was churning while i felt like my Adams Apple was going to explode. And just like that, it was all gone. I wiped the green shit from my nose and gazed at what was once my mom. *It was so sudden, what could I have done?*


The sight of my mom's head rocking back and forth interrupted my grieving. I could hear a rustling noise like a bird waking from it's nest. An object peeked out of the gunshot hole from the top of her head. *HOOOOOOOOF*


"Impossible..." I muttered.
A grown pigeon slid out and gained it's footing. It rustled it's feathers shaking the brain matter from it's breast. It took a few steps and shook. Did it ever shake. It shook, and shook. Violently it shook. 
*HOOOOOOFFFFFFF.... HOOAAAWWWWWWWFFFFFF.... AGGGHHH!!!!*

It's sounds became more human with every bellow. Shaking so hard my mothers blood splat across my face. I closed my eyes and put my hands on my ears trying to snuff out the noise and wish it away. Silence. I hadn't heard silence for hours. I opened my eyes checking to see if my wish had been granted and it had, perhaps I should have wished for my mother to be alive. *hooooof*

*I'm selfish. Maybe if I wished her alive she would be alive.* *Hooof*
*I'm useless. I should have seen the signs sooner.* *HOOOOOOOOOOF* </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I got D5 for the first time which should have been a great thing. Come to find out everyone in D5 trolls and drops your MMR. Then i'm playing vs p3-p2 players and they expect me to 1v5 carry. I don't even flaunt my rank at anyone they just berate me just cause i'm D5. I once had a guy tell me he wasn't going to listen to something I said because he thought I wasn't diamond so anything I said had no merit.


Quit shaming D5 players, we're people just like you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LoL is a game of action and reaction. Recognizing the actions and making the appropriate decision along with good mechanics is what it's about. Like when you're laning and enemy adc goes for last hit on cs, he is in animation while you can auto him. The price to cs is taking damage, but not always. Sometimes you need to stay back so that you don't get cc chained by the support and ignited and die. Work on dodging skill shots and dealing harass. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So say you're doing well in your lane, autoing then off creeps to where they are chunked or simply you just push faster so they are always at turret, this is called "lane pressure." If the enemy laner is forced to make a decision between taking creeps, or losing them and helping out his teammate which is a win win for you unless he gets the kills. That's why it's important to ward your bush next to the river and tri brush or further down in the river in the spot where the land goes down, it's a pin point of vision to spot enemy jungler or mid lane roam/gank. Anyways back to the question: If your jungler or mid laner is caught in river doing dragon or trying to invade help him if they are pushed to their turret. Another way is if the lane is even in the middle and the enemy adc and support go to help crossing into river bush. The advantages of having a cs lead will come into play as  you will spike earlier then them having an advantage. Now they made a mistake that ALOT of players make even in plat trying to help their jungler when they are pinched between the wall and you. This is an opportunity to force a 2v2, force summoner spells or push them out of lane. It is important when you back that you push your lane to the tower so that they have to take the cs stay and be in danger of being jumped or lose a wave of cs when you get back as you should be pushing the wave. Also if you are say 6/1 and enemy bot lane is 0/3 0/3 and you've taken first blood tower don't go mid. Tell your support to stay with you bot lane and keep pressure. Feel confident in your ability to 2v5 and smash them Bot style. Back when you need to but keep the pressure because going mid will just stall the game, get you killed and them fed unless you know you can take the tower. It's better to have level advantage, and you can acquire that by constantly pushing and pressuring. You'll get the most experience by yourself but pay attention to the map when you're solo and see if enemy is missing or if the jungler isn't on the map. You know you can take tower worry free if you kill bot lane and see the other 3 on your minimap.

Anything else? :D

<TEXT> I'm Plat 2 and here's my advice :D
First and foremost you have to know what every champion does. That'll help you realize if you're in a good position to do damage. Kiting is a big factor that translates to all elos but is very effective in lower elo because they will just chase you down and die so i recommend you pick up cait. To apply this use the key A and left click near the ground that'll attack the closest target to you so use it when being chased or a mix to get someone that is low that's backing off. Third, don't fight in a big minion wave, learn to dps poke without taking aggro from minions to the point where you lose a trade. (People that say trading i feel are snobby but it's actually a quite true use of the word.)

If you feel like you can win a fight roam to wherever it is if it's close to you. If you pick up kills it'll help you snowball. Bronze players make a lot of mistakes with mispositioning so there will be a lot of opportunities to take advantage of.

When you know the limits of your abilities make sure to enable quick cast so that you can animation cancel, which seems to be a large part of success. Example cait's e+q+auto.

Well I hope you got something from that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, i'm new to this subreddit, i came here specifically to see if I can get a diagnosis or if its just normal behavior.

I'm 24 years old and have been in a slump since I was 17 years old. I'm tired all of the time even when I get 8 hours of sleep. I'm afraid of consequences to the smallest degree as well as being antisocial and trying to avoid confrontation. My safety is my home and all I do is play video games while i'm there. When asked a question I don't really think about the answer it just kind of comes to me. I can think critically like solving math equations or figuring out whats wrong with computer code or recognizing a theme of a movie and I found out recently I can act under pressure when my dog was bleeding all over the floor from an animal attack I didn't waist time to tie a knot around his leg to stop the bleeding and take him to the vet. I have a voice in my head telling me over and over "I just want to go home, i'm tired." 

Anyways I guess that about covers it. Thoughts? Am I just normal but a loser, or do I have a condition that's holding me back from pursuing happiness? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't see how it's not worth it to be honest. Not trying to be condescending but the only way to get more gems is to keep doing missions or pay up so there isn't really a choice if you want more gems :D. It gets harder to get them, the more packs you get the more variety in your deck you'll have and compared to where you are at now it won't seem to be all that harder. It's not like you have to face 3 mirror walls + 3 sphere koribohs every game like KC cup :^) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the principle of it. All my life i've done nice things for people and get taken advantage of for it. And now you want to belittle me for wanting recourse. It was $200 when i bought it, could sell it online for $150, it was Christmas and he wanted it for his son so i said he could pay me later, but he didn't. And you think i'm the asshole. Nice. </TEXT>

I wouldn't think twice about it, i would thank the guy for beating his ass. Don't come into the country looking like that. Go to Afghanistan with gay tight clothes and you'll get worse.

<TEXT> Shit dude, even in plat games(not saying it's high elo but higher than most) people still flame for feeding. Especially if you're playing top lane and lose against a snowbally person and get camped it's rough. I just played a game last game where the support ali never initiated fights and i got super irritated with it and let him know, he told me that I was dumb cause I wasn't essentially carrying hard enough, I thought to myself "Jesus, I have to do everything myself." So I took two open inhibs while they seiged down t2 bottom turret all 5 and then we won the game afterwards. Even then though, the ali wasn't even a factor in that game and i'm sure all he wanted to do was keep his kda positive. Stuff like that makes me mad where people expect you to do everything for them. </TEXT>

Even if the person getting harassed IS doing something wrong, but putting in an effort, it doesn't mean that the person harassing that person isn't guilty of bad mistakes as well. Like if the harasser is the jungler who just died at baron and their whole team is going to do it while everyone is based, why is the jungler getting mad at the team when he's the one caused the situation in the first place? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-10-28 02:44:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Before you judge the build i finally tested it and it wasn't bad at all.


So here it is:


Runes:
Movement Speed Quints, Hybrid Pen Marks, Scaling Health Yellows, Scaling Ability Power Blues (or you can do flat ap or mr, up to you).


Masteries:
Fury, Double Edged Sword, Natural Talent, Bounty Hinter, Piercing Thoughts, Fervor of Battle, Savagery, Assassin, Merciless, Dangerous Game.


Build:
Core- Bloodrazor(red), Nashors Tooth, Frozen Mallet, Berserker Greaves.
Optional- Maw, Blood Thirster, Deadmans, Zzrot, GA, Banshees, Duskblade, Ludens Echo, Hextech Gunblade, GLP (Honestly up to you guys after core but i recommend at least 1 tank item.)


Max bushes first and then shield. Bushes give on hit damage scaling with ap and +10 base magic damage per level. I got ahead pretty fast and was doling out tons of damage to squishies, and even against a Nasus :D.


Anywho try it out yourselves and see if you like it :D. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wanna try ap/as ivern though. The bushes give bonus ap damage to auto attacks i think? if you build him like razor beak + nashors go movement speed quints, magic pen marks, ap blues and scaling health yellows, liandris + defensive items maybe like a deadmans and zzrot he might be okay. Bush's for his auto's and q for gap closing. I haven't tried it yet but maybe someone wants to? </TEXT>

I threw my tornado at the same time i ulted off his knock up (my intention was to layer the cc because i threw it at the person already knocked up.) Anyways i blinked to the target and rather than the tornado being thrown from the 1st position it was thrown from where i blinked. I don't have video to replicate it though. I thought I knew everything about Yasuo's mechanics but this is new to me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My guide for Lee Sin Plat 2 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-15 20:30:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys I have a really nice build for lee sin that I hope you guys like :D.

Runes: 2 Armor Quints, 1 AD Quint, 9 AD Marks, 9 Scaling Health Seals, 9 Scaling MR Glyphs.

Masteries: 5 Unyielding, Explorer, 5 Veteran Scars, Insight, 5 Swiftness, Strength of the Ages, 5 Savagery, Runic Affinity, 5 Fury, Expose Weakness.

Items: Warrior Trackers, Merc Treads, Triforce, Deaths Dance, Steraks, Dead Mans Plate.

Lee has a lot to do with early game so if you get ahead then triforce is what you should get. If not you can switch it out for a Sprit Visage or Guardian Angel if your team relies on your engage. Deaths dance is pretty essential for the staggering damage which helps with more bursty comps so it should be prioritized after triforce.

Build path: Hunters Machete 3 Health Pots- Trackers - Warrior - Boots - Phage - Triforce - Merc Treads - Deaths Dance - Dead Mans Plate - Steraks.

You can switch these out as i said before but I believe this to be the most optimal build.

Anyways, enjoy :D </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rick Fox Needs to be Talked to </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-17 04:14:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Look, full disclosure i'm not an expert on the LCS i'm just a viewer and a regular league player.

I also know that Rick Fox knows some things about the game exemplified in an interview [How Well Does Rick Fox Know League of Legends?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_CSXKr8EY) but he really needs to know A LOT more. If you look at TSM's owner Reginald or OG's owner xPeke they used to play League professionally and can step in when they're losing control of their team. That's why TSM has always been very prominent in the LCS, not because of the players are underperforming but because they aren't being instructed properly.

Rick Fox needs to realize that his team is in danger of relegations and he could potentially lose a lot of money that he put in with high hopes for his new organization. But he can learn the game more in depth at a later time.

Right now he just needs to get a new coach for his team and someone that can understand drafting. The draft in the 2nd TSM game was embarrassing. Only person that had wave clear on their team was lucian, if he bought a static shiv that is.

I'm not putting down the players of Echo Fox either, they just need someone to guide them and Rick needs an adviser. It's a business and he's about to lose it.

Edit: Grammer </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright well, the first thing you need to do is have a main champion. And when i say this I mean you have to know the limitations of the champion inside and out to your respective ability. You don't need to be able to do stuff that bjergson does. Anyways, then you need to know what all the items do, regularly check what the enemy team has for items, know what the limitations of your opponents champions, check your minimap-[ When i say this there are different meanings to this. When you check it you want to make sure that there are champions on the map before you start to go aggressive or else you are susceptible to ganks. You also need to know when to back off if you see that they are missing and learn to not overextend in your lane. ] Knowing how to snowball with a lead = basically if you're laning you just want to sit in your lane with the lead and be able to 1v2 or 1v3 split push non stop and solo carry your team. If your team feeds then you just need to make sure that each lane is covered if they aren't. If you see a big wave of minions make sure that you take them for yourself, don't let it all die to the tower and then lose a tower for nothing. If you see activity with your jungler in his jungle or if something is happening in a lane nearby make sure that you are moving to follow the fight if you are needed and decide whether or not following a fight is a good idea, sometimes it's a good idea just to sit in lane if it is a losing battle and just push a wave. Wave management = if you get a lead, position yourself between your lane opponent and your minions so that he can't cs efficiently. Either he takes damage from you by taking minions or he losses out on getting cs so in that situation it's a win win for you but watch out for ganks. Make sure to last hit in that situation as well. Don't auto attack full health minions, just wait till the minions die down before taking them, unless you need to back. When you back, make sure to clear the enemy minion wave so that you have a better chance of catching the next one after you get back from the shop. I'm not sure what the benefits of freezing the lane is other than forcing the opponent to either over extend for cs and get collapsed on or they have no choice but to get recourses elsewhere or group up. But the way you do it is you make sure that there are more minions on the enemy side than yours, make sure to last hit the minions and don't take aggro(that's very important). Then once your minion wave has been depleted then you can take aggro and move them upwards or sideways away from your tower so that they follow you. Once your minion wave is far enough up to where they crash on the enemy minion wave out of the area where your towers can attack, you can then drop aggro by walking into an unwarded bush, or by walking towards your minion wave far enough to where your minions will attack them, thus it will make the enemy minion waves attack yours, but they will follow you a little bit. This can help you catch up to your lane opponent as well if you are behind, BUT, if your team needs you, then you need to shove the wave and join them, but don't waste time, always be looking for recourses on the map to take without being in danger unless you know for certain you can kill them. I think that's it, but if you have any more questions let me know.  </TEXT>

When it doesn't crash in the custom you are safe to start playing normal games. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Found a way to prevent the reconnect bug! :D </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-14 09:33:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **The Fix**




Alright guys, so if the community hasn't found out by now there is a bug that's going around that's making it so people are going through a disconnection loop. I have found a solution so that it doesn't happen in ranked if you take precautionary measures. All you have to do is go into a custom game EVERY TIME BEFORE YOU QUEUE UP.





If it gives you the bug when you go into the custom then you'll just have to just keep trying until it goes away. I just played Diablo 3 when I thought all hope was lost. But just wait a while take a break and then try it again in custom to see if it disconnects you.




**Curious about the bug details?**

So what I have theorized about what this bug is is that when you get into a game it thinks that you are connected but in reality you're not. Thus you can't reconnect kind of like being the 6th man trying to join a 5 man group that's all filled up. This makes a giant loop of reconnect issues that ends when the game is over or 20+ minutes into the game when you can finally escape the reconnect page.

**Riot Tickets Submitted**

I was pretty upset when it first started to happen and the game kept disconnecting me randomly and I would get Leaver Buster penalties. I sent 3 tickets to riot explaining what was happening. The first one I gave them all of the information they asked for. They emailed me back telling me to do some troubleshooting. The second one I was furious telling them that it was still happening and nothing came of it. This third one i've shared what I know now about the bug and how to reproduce it along with all the information they asked for along with a video of what was happening during the process of the bug. I sent another reply a few hours ago so I should hear back tomorrow maybe.





**Troubleshooting**

When I received my first email they suggested that I input some code in my Terminal and it would restart some processes going on in league. However that didn't work and neither did the follow: repairing the client, reinstalling the client, restarting the router, restarting the computer and restarting the client.





**Variations of Reconnect**

So i've tried different ways to reconnect to the game all of which failed: option+command+esc (windows;ctrl+alt+delete) and clicking reconnect, waiting for the pop up and clicking the retry button, clicking the cancel button, alt tabbing and closing the client from the dashboard, force quitting in task manager, restarting computer.





**Last Hypothesis**

I theorize though that if you wait while you're inside the reconnect screen you shouldn't press the button right away and panic to try to get into the game asap. Instead you should wait about 2 minutes before trying again, and then if it fails wait another 2 minutes before trying again. During a custom game that it was stuck in reconnect i did this and it returned me to the main menu after waiting a while. Even in a custom game it will keep you in reconnect even if you exit the client being the only person in the game. 

If this helps anyone that's experiencing this issue like I am than this post will be wurf :3 </TEXT>

I sent Rito 3 tickets and they didn't do anything to help me and i sent them a final one with a video just yesterday when it happened again to show them wtf was going on. When they sent me the emails back the other times i sent in tickets they were pretty much denying it was their fault and that it was something on my end. Welp i repaired the client, reinstalled the game, tried every method of trying to reconnect short of actually unplugging my computer and it still won't stop doing it. It happens the 2nd game after my leaver buster is completed. It's happened 6 times to me so far now. 20 minute queues qq :'(. </TEXT>

So i do but it does the same thing so i comand option esc, it exits the black screen and goes back to the main client and tells me that the game crashed and i have to click the orange reconnect button.

<TEXT> If you keep getting the message that's like, application open close the open one, just close it unless the client is updating. You can see the patcher on the bottom with a loading bar barely visible. Just wait for it to be done. If not, just restart your computer.  Make sure to close all start up applications in the system preferences. I forget how to do that but googling it should do the trick. This should eliminate a bit of clutter and hopefully you can open it again. I find that my game won't open for a long time if i force quit diablo 3 and blizzard launcher. Just trying to open it over and over for a while might work. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The best idea for smurf accounts anyone has ever heard... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-18 08:03:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So... Me and my cousin were talking and we came up with a brilliant idea on what to do with Smurf accounts and the eternal suffrage that comes with leveling one up, or having to play against one.



**Buying accounts Max(3)**

*The point of this is that you should be allowed to buy a new account, from riot.


If we buy accounts for 20 dollars from Riot from the in-game Riot store, it'll be a level 30 account shared skins and champions and rune pages from your linked account.



**New Players and Leveling up**

*This will help new players by avoiding the Smurfs in their climb, and allow the people who want to start fresh in a new division.


 Smurfs won't have to spend endless hours leveling up an account, buying new champions and everything else that comes with it. New players will be given the chance to learn, rather than getting flamed for their new mistakes from more experienced players.



**Punishment**

*All accounts linked to the main account will be punished as well.


So often do you get punished and banned on an account just to log in to another one without a care. Now all accounts will be banned to punish the people that the community feels should be (a new log in name would still allow you to play through the duration of the ban so it still wouldn't be a permanent ban, just the linked ones with all of the content.)



What do you guys think about this? Please Rito, recognize this amazing idea. :D

**Edit:** Formatting </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just played different champs for a while and certain ones i feel are a lot funner to play than others. For mid i play yasuo or azir, jungle i play lee sin, top i play rumble or renekton, adc i play lucian or ashe (sometimes i'll dabble with vayne and cait) and for support ill do blitz, braum, thresh, bard or alistar. Usually i go jungle cause i feel like that role makes the greatest impact on the game. Just keep playing and some champs you'll excel at more than others. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What should be done about true damage? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-19 20:51:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was talking to my cousin a little while ago and we were having a debate about what should be done with true damage.


**Create item to have a chance to build against it**

Too long has a Vayne destroyed tanks with silver bolts despite the heavy armor builds.

The Darius true damage, the Garen true damage, the Fiora true damage is honestly too much. Olaf does a measly 200ish true damage with his e, but you have a Darius that can 100-0 a tank with 1 combo and penta the rest of the team with a full tank build... ya... okay.

**[Enter item name]**

*Reduce damage taken from true damage by 30%. +400Health*

This way, you lose an item slot if you are itemizing against true damage so that ADC's have a better chance of doing damage mid-game. Only health should be included because if it were a first buy and didn't have health, you would still get rekt.


This can clean up some of the frustration some people have with ADC's as well as fix some problems with the increasing true damage problem.


*What do you guys think?*

**Edit:** Keep an open mind about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright. So im guessing that you're silver-bronze elo? No offense. I'm a plat 4 player, and there is advice i can give. So basically, you don't "have" to buy a pink ward, but you do need to help the team out with vision control. It depends on where you are on the map, where you think the enemy is going to be and controlling areas like dragon and baron as well as when you're laning, it's important to ward your lane. As far as positioning, you need to know where you are supposed to be this comes with practice. If you're confident you can 2-3 shot someone as an adc then do it and front line and be fearless but, you need to know what the capabilities are of the enemy team which just boils down to knowing what each champion does. However if you're not super fed and cant kite out then you need to stay behind your front line. If you're a tank you need to initiate or peel for your carry's. Also you need to realize that every pick that you make needs to fit in with what you're team is doing if you want to group and team fight but split pushing is also effective. You need to know that when you're low hp, it depends on if you should go back or not. When you're low in laning phase for instance after your jungler came to your lane and killed the enemy laner and the jungler and you have vision of the rest of the enemy team, you should really shove your lane, take turret or whatever objective is available or near that is possible to take. Killing the enemy team isnt all that will get you ahead, but taking the wave of farm that's in front of you, maybe proxy a bit and deny him the farm by the tower killing it. It's about having a larger margin of everything which will result in you spiraling out of control and harder for them to deal with.

<TEXT> Hello, I just got platinum 5 as of yesterday and felt I needed to post this. I was playing vayne a game ago. It was pretty close, I tried to do what i could, but in the end my team didn't have the composition to engage and when i tried poking I got charmed by the enemy Ahri and we lost. Game before that enemy jinx penta killed us when we dove her (which was very impressive) and we lost (which was a well deserved win by the jinx). Then this last game I just played I decided to play Vayne again because my friend who just got Diamond said that he pretty much spammed her for 40+ games to climb. I was pretty mad the other game and on edge because of how close those games were, and the last one we lost was due to a lack of engage. However, my support just sat in lane all game, hardly doing anything. When he had a chance to ult tristana in lane which would have been an easy kill, he just walked up to get targon passives and walk back. Then when he does engage and I commit off of it and die and he tells me i'm bad. Our team is very far behind at this point because the enemy Viktor killed our Yasuo 5 times 1v1 in lane and then they grouped and took our tower. Their lead was very large, I felt like I needed to try to make a play and tried to take down the Tristana but I failed at it. Then when I failed again, I get called bad by my support for a second time. My whole team is doing horribly, there were so many chances for Braum to jump on our lane and snowball, so many time the jungler could have ganked for us but it never happened. I was finally fed up with being called bad for trying and quit. I really hate this game some times. Does anyone else do this from time to time? Keep in mind I have over 1k games this season and don't do this at all. </TEXT>

Now I feel like i'm almost waisting my time filling out applications because I don't hear back from 80% of the things I apply for. How that pertains to league is almost a straight line because I live in a small town and don't have any real friends so I spend most of my time playing League of Legends and not doing anything else because if i'm not playing League then i'm doing nothing since there IS nothing to do. That's just my situation. Hopefully though it will change and i'll go back to working 70+ hours a week or what ever I can get. But of this moment, and for the time I wasn't working while going to school, I was, and am an addict. </TEXT>

Also i would have liked to know that you needed to ward when playing support and what the responsabilities are of each roll. I would have liked to know what counter jungling was. Thats basically the basics of what would have saved me a lot of time and a lot of verbal abuse from others but at the same time when i was first starting out the game i thought it was fun to experiment with all of the cool items and champions. But at the same time, it would help others to know this stuff so that other people don't get punished while playing with a very new player. My brother never played the game again after two games because he got reported for being an unskilled player which he was and people expected more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You just have to play alot of games. You honestly get to understand the game when you have a lot experience. When you are forced to play a role you're not very good at you just have to do your best. Just try to trade economically. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So i made a new account a while back because i got suspended for two weeks. I recently got suspended again so i went back to it. Now i'm actually starting to do very well. My main account is Gold 2 and i'm currently 44/24 normal wins on this new account. Is there a way to find out what type of smurfs i'm playing with?
EDIT: Yeah i mean i'm unranked. My level is 18 at the moment. I heard that depending on your w/l ratio you'll be put with people of equal skill which are smurfs. </TEXT>
