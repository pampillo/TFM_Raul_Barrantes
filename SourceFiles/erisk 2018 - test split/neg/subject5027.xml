<TEXT> You realise there's a huge scandal emerging about karma farming and corporate shill accounts crushing Reddit's true nature? 

It's very interesting but it is actually a huge problem coming down the pipes where it's really easy to control top comments and general sentiment of the hive mind. 

Imaginary internet points by shill accounts let them manipulate Reddit further and, generally, It's being done by systematic repost bots that gain accreditation enough to create their own subreddit or appear as if they are a valuable member of a community instead of a product with a design purpose.

While most people call out a repost because they call it like they see if, I invite you to talk your own advice and move on instead of hassling people who call out reposts. Some of them are more concerned for this place than you are aware of. </TEXT>

"'Not as a reboot, we can just reimagine it. We'll keep the basic principle of Aliens are hunting you,' and do what we envisioned  that's what we should do. We like the name; if you distill and take out everything you know about the previous game, or the canceled game, and just said the namePrey, it's a cool name. We think it really fits what it is that we're making.'"

That's from Pete Hines talking to the lead designer of Ariane. Blatantly calling it "not a reboot".

<TEXT> The experience system is in the shrines. It very clearly has level up mechanics and would not require, and I wasn't asking for, a rework. 
For instance, cashing in exp could be done through shrines, one bonus per shrine. Keeps everything intact but also encourages you to engage the environment. It's very much what they have already going except the require you to conquer multiple shrines to advance your character and limit the amount of shrines on the map to allow for the "max lvl".
I also understand loot. You don't need question marks after every sentence. Just asking if anyone else saw it. The removal of incentive. I knew I'd be getting a lot of snark from asking this question. But yes I understand loot, thank you </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand that I was hoping to get some more information on specifically PIA, if they have more than one region available or at least if someone could verify certain regions through experience rather than go poke at their website. 

Yeah I've heard about that, blocking torrent traffic,which kind of seems ridiculous to me. I've always been a fan of the old adage "more laws, more criminals". In context here we can see a bunch of people scrambling to learn about VPNs, redirecting and hiding traffic when it wasn't a problem (for most) just a few years ago. Now it's going to be every Tom, Dick and Sally understanding how to hide traffic and reroute things online because it becomes forefront knowledge... It's ignorance of that stuff that's let law enforcement even try to come close to the new age of dark web hitmen and pedophilia </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really works well with the yolks honestly. I guess the moisture content/Removal really pushes the flavor into it. So honestly tread lightly at first. But with meats it's the opposite, the flavor takes a long time and has a hard time penetrating to the core in a meaningful way. So I really pound it in the cure for meats. But light for the yolks. Truly a cool way to keep an individual flair to your cured products </TEXT>

We also hang in cheesecloth in this kitchen but I've used the dehydrater for the best result. Just be careful not to go too far in which case we created a neat cured egg yolk glass. Unintentional but awesome if you want to try it </TEXT>

People like attractive characters. End of story. 

Are you going around life fucking girls, or guys, or toasters, that are 4's at best? Nah... you probably prefer a 7 at least, and you imagine a 10 when you're about to blow it. I'm really not going to be sensitive on the subject and say I'm fighting for men's rights. I mean I know where I stand. I'm like, a 6 at best, but I'm funny and got a beard, so I can work with it.

<TEXT> It's just some scared child who thinks that a couple of introductory courses have opened her mind to something that no one else is privy to. 
That she sees this huge change happening in the world when really this has always been the same game, she's merely projecting her little mind riot outwardly.
She thinks that she's ready to join an ill conceived, poorly led, faceless organization with a vague definition, facing down the exact same as it stares back with another bunch of clueless children so happy to be a part of something finally. All for the want of gang violence they seen on the tv when they grew up in middle America, where mommy fucked the mailman and daddy fucked her young friend Jenny and the world escaped them both, but not her, it won't be like that for her.

Now it's her turn to belong, and that guy on the wooden crate seems convincing. She'll say one thing, believe another, change her words again, bleed for her cause, beg for mercy, deny, change up, repeat, until one day she finds herself with a few memories she cringes about while she gets fucked by the mailman.

Middle America has always been the same joke. This poor child deserved to get punched in the mouth but instead of standing up and admitting it she's asking for preferential treatment. I know where some of us come from we call that a "little bitch.". Under them dreadlocks hides a little blonde girl who need an excuse to be herself. Wake up little blonde bitch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is not nearly as threatening as it seems at first glance.  It's important to keep in mind that this nation has survived on a very visible sanctions/rhetoric/aid cycle... While I don't think Mr. Trump creates a stable geopolitical environment, I also don't believe this is anything out of the normal for North Korea on the global stage. 

For instance here's an article from 2013 citing over 20 similar provocations:

http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/21/a-running-list-of-north-koreas-near-daily-threats-updated/

It's actually incredibly difficult to count the number of times this kind of occurrence has happened, that is to say, the number of times North Korea has blamed another country for bringing nuclear war closer to a reality.  </TEXT>

It's almost as if Trump isn't paying attention. Giving China a box of candy before he offers them a lollipop isn't going to have a dramatic effect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've worked in kitchens with unions. Would not recommend. Low man on the totem takes the most work, massive turn over rate of the newest employees as it takes months and months to get into the union, and usually you're just supporting the highest paid, least working, long standing top dogs. 

I've been in several unions across several industries and besides these very obvious flaws there's also Union dues that you pay in, taking another chunk out of an already meager check. 

I do fine for myself, and I suggest to nonyabusiness that you work contractual hours into salary negotiations and anything beyond the contacts standard needs to have an hourly wage assigned, as that's often overlooked in our field.. but also it seems like you thatwasyouraccount have no Union or kitchen experience.

<TEXT> I have to agree with the the Redditors here. I love this chef, one of my favorite, one of the few that continues to inspire me. 

There are many chefs who have a healthy trajectory in our industry, starting out low paid unskilled workers and ending with decent wages and impressive resumes. They maintain high standards and are willing to move to keep moving up the ladder and maintaining an increasing wage lifestyle. They save and invest properly and continue to work for great chefs who understand how to manage successful kitchens. 

Unfortunately these are the smallest percentage of chefs and the vast majority get stuck in disfunctional kitchens with ill equipped owners and often under skilled chefs.  There is a shortage of line cooks because it's physically and mentally demanding labor that pays the same as low effort employment like retail or any entry level service job.  More often than not passion is crushed under an imbalance of expectations against reward.  

The industry is creating it's own problems and those towards the top often forget why.  I support programs like these or even the cunt Jamie Oliver when he helps out recently free paroled criminals.  There is a heart to some chefs bigger than the normal people could imagine...

But ultimately as consumers demand competitive prices while multinationals stuff gym mats into grinders to create a cheaper burger, there just isn't going to be enough money in this business to lure in the top budding minds when confronted with the weight of working expectation.  Many of us recognise it and choose to put our no nonsense direct, aggressive personalities into other ventures instead.

My first chef, very successful, top of my country at the time, numerous restaurants, retired at a decent age, told me simply..

"Do you wish to make money in your life?"

"Yes chef of course," I responded.

"Then get out of the kitchen and do something else"

<TEXT> Yeah I'd have to agree. The Redditor is trying to claim a conspiracy about hiding Netflix originals when he presents an elegant argument for why the system needed to be changed.  Beautiful work with the quotes, I really think they're fairly intelligent for acknowledging that people act as critics instead of just acknowledging enjoyment.

I'd like to point out that I don't love the new system, and that since its inception Netflix has been making strides to accommodate the lowest common denominator toaster, but let's take a moment to realize that yes; most people are idiots.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys. Lot of infighting here in the comments but I'd like to bring us back to the point.  This is yet another hike in our already expensive cellular plans, and nobody is coming to help us.

I've emailed the CCTS, TheCommissioner for Complaints for Telecommunications Services, and my email will be copied into this comment, feel free to bombard them with a copied version of the email. 

But I'd also like to help, suggest anything that can help and let's try to organise for this. Black out date. Mass migration to another company. What do you think would be the best most practical way to proceed and grab the largest number of people.

My email to the CCTS, feel free to use or alter however you want. Please help however you can........

*
I'm emailing today in regards to the increase in rates I've been told about by Bell Mobility.


To my understanding every major provider will be adding approximately ten dollars to their services, excluding koodo.


I am not one to email my outrage to consumer protective organizations as I tend to believe that others, more easily prone to outrage, will be first in line. However I must express my disgust with Canadian mobile service providers and as well those charged with protecting consumer rights, such as yourself.


It's recently been publicised, and numerous times before, that we have some of the highest cell phone rates in the world. Here is a recent article for your validation:


http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/business/crtc-phone-study-1.3717093


With this in mind it is absolutely egregious that these companies have unilaterally moved forward with yet another rate hike, blatantly disregarding the consumer and laughing at the impotence of organizations such as the one you work for. While some of us may not struggle with rate increases, others have come to very much struggle with paying for what is now considered essential technology for the job market.


I will be encouraging others to write you as well as putting forward options to find a solution to show our disgust in a proper way, as you have failed us yet again.


Sincerely

*

<TEXT> This is going to sound foolish at first glance but it's tried tested and true for thousands of years.

Water.

Drink plenty of it and you'll need to piss in the early hours. Famous from the Simpsons reference it's actually been used for ages to wake at early/irregular hours by many societies and remains ultra effective to this day. Truly I have not used an alarm in... Jesus I can't even tell you when.  Whether it's early rise, or overnight flight, just clear your system and down some real water levels before your system goes into stasis.

For most of us it's very difficult to deny this urge and it will force you to get up and out of bed. And most importantly, at that point just *stay up*. 
 
If you're having this much difficulty with alarms it's possible there's more at work on your head, including an abject rejection of the day or situation to come. But skipping all the potential issues at play I would suggest you go for the oldest alarm clock in the book and chug several tall glasses of water just as you're about to sleep.  

You'll know your body and your bladder so make sure to drink enough... But good luck with it all and try not to smash any phones! </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I support atheism I find this argument less than compelling. It's like saying that because doctors commit a fuck ton of murders we shouldn't have healthcare or medicine.

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2006.00273.x/abstract

I understand the relationship between a religious indoctrination and the psychological issues that arise, which I assume is the point of this "numbers post", but by leaning on statistics, particularly a one month sample, we weaken legitimacy to our arguments. 

For instance we could look at this and say, more people died falling out of bed than clergymen were arrested this month for *all charges*... This doesn't even include bed related injuries.  Making the real demon bed manufactures. We must therefore remove beds from our society.

Clearly beds are ok. At least for me. But by reducing our religious arguments to statistics and number games, rather than the the elements which drive them, we do our cause no favors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's an axe throwing place downtown. Jack axes. Fun and safe but they serve alcohol so call ahead to see if it's classified as a bar, I really don't think it is and it's a great time so am absolute must.

The rooms is our museum of sorts, and while not for everyone it's architecture makes it fun to explore and red oak have a restaurant up top floor, can't remember it's name but they're all great and the view is fucking amazing.

And always happening you can grab some small plates and enjoy some Jazz at the fifth ticket downtown.

Signal Hill is a classic and amazing spot, the wind is high and it gets cold as you can imagine. But looking back at the city in night or out into the ocean can be captivating.

Other than that take a stroll downtown and enjoy. Best restaurant in Canada is here, Raymond's, but the owners have opened a second place called merchants tavern which is a bit more accessible to the general population and has all kinds of nautical theme and a gorgeous open kitchen too watch the boys work.

I mean of course they were the only organization to preach poverty but accumulate vast wealth and power. 

The only one ever! 

It's not common place at all for groups and organizations to try to accumulate strength of self interest. Nope! Never happened before and certainly not normal, never happened again either! 

I mean that's why it's shady right, it behaved so different from every other organization at the time and since  right. Yep! Certainly not the most commonplace expectations at all </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no over qualified for hourly. Just forget that concept altogether. Numerous highly qualified industries charge exclusive by hourly (ie: lawyers, mechanics, technicians, etc). And at the same time shit loads of idiots get paid salaries in our industry. Forget the concept and move on with a decision on your own hourly rate, or your salary rate. Put either choice on the table moving forward with a new employer.

Use your skills and prove to be effective for $25-$30 (example) an hour and not a waste of money, they'll avoid working you too many hours then. Alternatively be sure to include a stipulation in your contact if you go salary, the stipulation being that the salary is for a forty four hour work week, and if you surpass that the hourly rate is x dollars for every hour. So many young people I've seen sign onto contracts without understanding it's very very very standard to outline the hours in a standard work week related to your salary.

I've never heard of over qualified for an hourly wage and perhaps it's a concept that's regional, but I can not stress enough that you must decide for yourself what your skills are worth hourly or on salary. You're allowed to waiver by small degrees and take a little less or a little more to compromise one thing or another, but try not to compromise yourself too much. It sounds like you're worth something and people will be lucky and happy to have you even if there's a struggle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey man, much respect for the sentiment you're conveying, I too tend to feel minimums don't cover some situations we get ourselves in. Having said that this is professional and it is your life and career you are ultimately interested in, no one would expect less.

There are regional laws for notice and termination, I know mine but it doesn't always help. Personally, and I hope this helps without coming across as sentimental, I try to be as honest and direct as possible. I tell them point blank,

Ex: " I'm leaving, but I understand our situation... I'll be giving a guaranteed two weeks employment moving forward and I'll happily help in the search and training of a replacement. After the two weeks I'll also help out you guys anyway I can as long as my priority is given to my new job. I can work shifts when available until the replacement is trained, I'll always be in touch to help with vendors and recipes. You've been great and I want you to succeed as much as I want myself to succeed, so let's make this work, BREAK!!" haha

I've worked two jobs and extreme hours to help out a previous employer I've befriended, while on another instance they took my notice as an insecurity and they released me with a lay off (where I am located termination requires at least one prior written warning, and since they didn't have it they were forced into a lay off situation). It can go either way, but ultimately I was satisfied.

We're strong personalities, in small numbers, so we get attached. Just be honest, direct, and provide the limited options available to help those out who you deem fit. It's what makes us chefs. An unwavering direction and the strength to just make sure this fucking works.  

They hate to love us. Or love to hate us. 

Good luck 
From your fellow blood soaked savage forgotten by time and civil society. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My PC currents, some might appeal to you

Cities Skylines (city builder, like SimCity but good)

Fallout (all of em, cause I'm just more comfortable in the wastelands)

GTA V (can't go wrong, visually stunning with mods and a little of everything available for a gamer)

Hitman Absolution (the new one has six missions, Absolution has nineteen with great detail and an awesome involving story line)

Osiris New Dawn (early release stage, survival "horror" that has me addicted like crack. So fun. So gorgeous. Can not give these guys enough support, they're doing so well and involved with the community to avoid a no man's sky debacle)

Witcher 3 (it's a bigly game, huge hands, everybody knows it, China, period)

<TEXT> It is insane to me that the top comment is about unwanted rebooting. Not that it happens to me, and nor do the ads, but because upon its release Windows 10 was a well documented privacy breacher, bandwidth stealer, and it just shocks me to see that even so much time later my Reddit brahzinskis are still suffering from it.

Here
https://windows.gadgethacks.com/how-to/everything-you-need-disable-windows-10-0163552/

And here
https://www.cnet.com/how-to/10-things-to-disable-in-windows-10/

And finally
http://lifehacker.com/how-to-configure-windows-10-to-protect-your-privacy-1716204024

Some of this will be repeated from a previous article, and some may be redundant for your system, but do yourself the favor and check into the level of connection and sharing you're involved with.

Disable auto updates immediately. Cut off the open peer to peer sharing they've forced on you. Disable advertising. Close the flood gates of personal information you're sharing as you see fit. But you can take it as far as you like, and these are friendly easy ways to get a more stable and private system. Upon my first install it took me two days with open eyes to disable the amount of spyware I found and even knowing it was an intrusive system I was genuinely shocked at how far it went. 

Anyways this article will be irrelevant for you as it was me if you just take a moment, good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. Even without the plan. An apology needs to be at least the first three. My fucking ex was fucking horrific for this shit. She would apologise with an insincere "I'm sorry you're bothered by that," putting the blame onto me. 
I truly think some people are incapable of actually admitting blame, her wording was the level of a professional lawyer in order to avoid any consequence being on her. 
And in the end she would then say others can't get so upset at her when she repeated the same offenses over and over, because the distance she created was too much out of proportion. She infuriated everyone in her life frequently but of course, it was not her fault. Brutal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Men! Am I right?"
*Crowd goes wild*

Below a giant moon worm hears the thunderous applause and redirects itself. The announcer continues,

"They're just the worst!! Am I right?"
*Crowd intensifies screaming and applause*

The moon worm begins to salivate, increases his speed, and narrows down on the appetizing sounds location. His salivation only helps to speed him through the earth below the unwittingly tempting crowd of *"man haters"*. Blind as he is he knows he's getting closer all the while they're celebrating. Hunger is all he knows for certain.

"Don't be afraid to help around the house Jim! Heck maybe you should stay in the house this time around," the announcer triumphantly climaxes.

The crowd begin the claw at their own flesh in excitement while tearing out their hair to present to their goddess. This is their time, not to be shared, and it begins now. 

The thunderous applause grows so loud no one can hear it coming. He's close now. He can smell the blood above through the damp earth. 

The crowd, so loud now, can not differentiate between applause and the ominous low tone of the moon worm crushing the earth below their feet. And then, in an instant, it begins.

The earth cracks below their feet swallowing the stadium and creating a sink hole effect that sends sheer panic through the crowd. Their last instant sounds just as their first as they scream blood from their lungs while the moon worms jaws emerge, encircling all they can see. The walls of his jaws surround them, covered in jagged unkept teeth, as he raises victorious from the earth. The crowd is pounded against the earth, the collapsed stadium, one another, and the wall of teeth shredding their once energetic bodies without remorse. Those that are lucky enough die quick, while others witness the darkness of the moon worm around them and feel terror with their last breathes. How could they have known. Finally as the last are bludgeoned against the moon worms blunt killing instruments they are all once more silenced.

As the moon worm closes his jaws and darkness circles the scene, he retreats once more into his home.



He hears a low rumble... Another earth worm... In the distance..  it's communicating...

"Al," it starts.

"Come back to bed," it finishes.

"Uhh no Peg," he responds, flushing the toilet.

<TEXT> Dude or dudette I had a great time playing this. Totally recommend buying it, but try to get it on sale. But I'll say that for every game.
Open world is fun and a bit zaney, missions are not the most varied you'll ever see but there's many different side missions that help improve your character. Racing, climbing, flying, wing suit "falling" etc.  
I still love it, never finished it because of the grind aspect, but I just finished resident evil 7 and it's my go to in between game. Highly recommend having it in your collection regardless of any moderate grind aspects

The wrong people are buying the front page of Reddit to discredit it and confuse the legitimate arguments. Of course that's a conspiracy and really I'm not interested in living like that. But I can suggest that Reddit will no longer be worth its weight if this continues. Voting manipulation needs to be understood by all Redditors and we need to be clear on our moderation of fake news, it's no good for either side of any argument. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some stuff has become more pricey because of general interest and new markets. Chicken wings alas are one of these bad boys. I always point to flank steak. Before we started serving that in restaurants it was outrageously cheap, because honestly it's a shit cut only worth braising. But now with it on every other menu it's popularity has increased and we're paying so so so so much more from a shit cut. Way more than the average beef price increase year over year.

<TEXT> Not very surprising when you consider it was understood to be a bottom feeder. Where I'm from my grandmother still considers lobster to be a poor person food (along with mutton and rabbit). As a bottom feeder they feast often on dead and decaying matter, and that was considered beneath the privileged class. Funny enough whole wheat or multigrain bread was considered beneath the privileged class as well, since it wasn't the fancy bleached white shit, and now look at us.
I've always found it funny in food culture poor dishes and dishes of preservation have been elevated and served to the rich and well off. Lobster, whole grains, rattatouille, duck confit, smoked salmon/trout, cured meats, etc etc.

But in this particular situation you need to loudly proclaim, "I don't give a fuck what you'll say you can't just grab my dick! What the fuck is wrong with you! Your cousin was right you need to get fucking help!" Then look to other people and immediately get them involved. If they escalate further you gotta be ready.

<TEXT> I'd like to see more activity too, but I think with the flurry of titles that have come out in the past few months it makes sense why a small, still under-developed game like this isn't the talk of the town.

It's a fucking great game though and we all know it. They've come so far, from a few months ago with a team of just two now they're running with fourteen members.
 
I seen some people hacking and cheating and they've addressed this recent as well. Ruins the game but apparently it's also stalled their development weeks as they develop and implement anti-cheating ideas. 

I look forward to the next big update which they're potentially dropping during or around PAX East conference, and that's just over a week away! They've said it's their biggest update yet so I'm pretty excited, and I'm sure we'll see more talk about the game if they do well with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey happy to see a new player in the community!

First just to let you know the devs are very active in the steam community, last posting Feb 21, and you can see for yourself what they're up to and talk directly to them here:

https://steamcommunity.com/app/402710

You will start to die of dehydration when you run low on water. Ideally drink water before this point ha. You'll need it but generally only after a few days active, lots of running, etc

Creatures do not level up with you currently and are set at the difficulty chosen upon launch of the game. They are not more difficult further from your spawn point either. The difficulty usually lies in returning to your base with materials and the like.

They are planning to open up more of the universe yes, but to my understanding neither planet is finished yet. Aziel is a very recent release so expect to wait for a third planet. 

I hope this helped a bit and again stay close to the steam page these devs have been great with the community. </TEXT>

After you compare economies and living standards, average wages etc there's really nothing here you don't understand. And further more London is currently under going what this article warns of.

www.standard.co.uk/news/london/more-people-dying-penniless-and-alone-in-london-official-figures-show-a3125956.html%3Famp

I personally can't understand how you don't understand but are capable of citing all the high costs associated with a city you're leaving? The article is warning of the time when you leave Toronto and say the same thing about it that you have London. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is not entirely unheard of but is very much indicative of the current political situation. Some background for those who don't know what this is. 

White House Correspondents' Association(WHCA) is an organization of journalists who cover theWhite Houseand thePresident of the United States. The WHCA was founded on February 25, 1914, by journalists in response to an unfounded rumor that aCongressionalcommittee would select which journalists could attend press conferences of PresidentWoodrow Wilson.

Its most high-profile activity is the annualWhite House Correspondents' Dinner, which is traditionally attended by the president and covered by the news.

Many annual dinners were cancelled or downsized due to deaths or political crises. The dinner was cancelled in 1930 due to the death of former presidentWilliam Howard Taft; in 1942, following the United States' entry into World War II; and in 1951, over what PresidentHarry S. Trumancalled the "uncertainty of the world situation."

I would like to just suggest the president openly skipping this is again an "uncertainty of the world situation". Please support real journalists and ignore party politics for the safety of all, this man may be so dangerously out of touch it could ripple out for a long time to come.

<TEXT> I think this guy needs to get out of his current arena.

 He wants to safely play with civilized people because it's comfortable and not dangerous to run his mouth. Civilised people tolerate him and get frustrated.

If he wants to dance on the edge of civility, and advocate such discrimination and hate, I'd like to see it happen in a back alley where people still use more than words. An arena more fitting for such big talk from such a small little human. </TEXT>

<TEXT> These were not made like that. 

A "barely simmer" will allow the first and second membrane to pull away from the yolk so I definitely disagree with that. In my experience you will end up with "tails" of whites. A rapid boil is not best, but just below it, particularly if adding enough egg to lower the temperature of the water. But I can not suggest a barely simmer for this result.

Acid is important to help, generally cover the bottom of your pot with a thin layer of a soft flavor vinegar, in this case pomegranate. 

The single biggest thing to get this result is to control the water, and thus the eggs, direction. By creating a whirlpool in your hot water (stirring in one direction nice and steadily) you create an environment where the white membranes naturally wrap around the yolks center of mass. This is absolutely imperative to consistently shaped poached eggs.

As long as the egg is dropped quickly and steadily it is irrelevant where it comes from. They can be dropped from their shell as these were. Often we use ramekins to drop eggs in a steady rapid fashion, but only when trying to take advantage of the whirlpool effect and when doing dozens at a time. Dozen ramekins, big whirlpool, begin dropping, cook for a few minutes while cracking the next dozen. But then you have a dirty ramekins so that won't be happening at home on my day off.

And truthfully for me the egg must be pulled out of the water with carry over cook in mind, dried gently, and then served.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lets not forget our nuclear role, Canada normally supplies approximately 75% of the worlds supply of Cobalt-60 used to sterilize 45% of the worlds single-use medical supplies. We were once the top supplier of nuclear reactors to the world as well.

Canada has the longest coastline of any country in the world at 243,977 kilometers  151,600 miles.

Our second language record, Montreal is the worlds second largest French speaking city after Paris.

The longest highway in the world is the Trans-Canada Highway which is over 7604 kilometers (4725 miles) in length.

Alert, inNunavutTerritory, is the northernmost permanent settlement in the world.

The border between Canada and the United States is officially known as the International Boundary. It is 5,525 miles long, including the 1,538 miles between Canada and Alaska. Its the worlds longest unprotected border.

We enjoy long walks on the beach and quiet candlelit dinners and mostly hate Trump. We like dogs. It took us almost a hundred years to decide on our flag. We celebrated Thanksgiving before the Americans historically and every year we celebrate before them again, just so we know what's what. We like Keanu Reeves. Focus on that actually. Just talk about Keanu Reeves for an hour

There are many instance of tamed animals from all throughout the animal Kingdom regardless of their tendency to live in a pack or not. And your suggestion that a tiger or any other big cat is easier to control than a bear is completely out to lunch. Do you hunt or have you seen any of these critters for yourself? You seem to be putting forward an argument of invalidity just to put it out there. Bears can domesticated. Guaranteed. Keep dreaming your weird dreams and don't let this negative Nancy mislead you.

<TEXT> Hey so I did some rooting around and it is in fact a Chinese based clone of the Famicom, and ran for numerous years in high production. Closing production in 1994 and owned in the end by a Taiwanese company TXC.
It was generally sold with a pin-adaptor allowing it to play official Famicom releases as well as it's own games (of which I'm having a hard time pinning down exactly how many were produced and by whom)
You're not getting many replies because it predominantly existed in markets that early Nintendo did not attempt to break into, thus it's users probably don't speak English as a first language. 
It has various versions, some were produced in massive numbers by TXC, others not so much. Checking world wide markets (thank you google translate) it's still selling at roughly $150 used, sometimes CIB, which likely suggests it still exists in decent numbers but is entering collector's status.
Best i could do! Happy collecting! </TEXT>

Part of me wants to agree with you. But while I watch my friends age into menial positions in bland cubicles and I get to enjoy my music loud and my daily inspirations in action it's hard to look at it so black and white. You had many good years, some will have none of that, menial dedication, no pressure, no satisfaction. I'm not sure I can agree with you so easily even as I age and question my career. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd have to agree. While initially mutations will exist you have to keep in mind Chernobyl happened very recently compared to the timeframe given for fallout lore. Don't get me wrong there are issues to critique, but on this topic it's very unlikely first generation mutations survive, let alone procreate. They are much more likely (like Chernobyls) to die, young, and tragically if we're being honest.

The fev of course makes more sense, but I think ghoulification is a huge stretch, and might merit your specific concern on mutations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are actually "that terrible". If you need to describe food as not "that" bad, fuck off and have some standards. And it's false economy. A mind set like yours is that which allows this shit to continue.

 It's substantially cheaper pound for pound in the long run to make your own mashed potatoes.  People are paying for a night out and shelling out their hard earned money for food they expect something of. If you'll proudly march the box of mash out to the table and ask them for their money I might consider this less than total bullshit. But no. I won't. Your opinion is not "that" awful but it is definitely awful </TEXT>

<TEXT> One where families are in seperate rooms with glass walls between them. They are fed through a slotted hole similar to prison, and given a curtain around both shower and toilet. But overall it is very open and very visible to the adjacent family. Each family has two parents and two children. They can not hear the family in the next room but they can not avoid seeing them for long.
After two weeks the youngest child of each family is rotated to the next adjacent room, all moving down the line to a new family. At first it's an experiment to see how others treat strangers welcomed into their family knowing they are being judged similarly to those who have their youngest child.
Within four weeks though, you stop feeding the families... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Quick Google search brings up dozens of models of this style of "axe" or guitbox, bass or stringamajig. My friend had a similar bass that was white years before the show ever emerged. It's possible it's a nod, hard to tell tell because these styled guitars have been famously played since the seventies.  Generally it's a one sided axe, brought into prominence by KISS but double sided axes are available and commonplace. I'm not a fan. But I'm a huge fan of regular Show.

<TEXT> So there was a lot that kept me from loving this to the point I've loved other Final Fantasy's but by the end I was fully drawn into the story, the gameplay, and even the characters (despite not watching the movies). But, and this may not get me any friends here, I have to say, the last Battle required zero skill and felt ridiculously "on rails". I legitimately can't recall fighting an easier boss... perhaps in my entire life? The creatures outside the Citadel were significantly more difficult and the threat of dying was at least real. I know I'm not the only one who noticed this so what does everyone think of having such an "on rails" end boss?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is blatantly inaccurate. Innumerable societies have not protected women. Where the fuck did you get that idea? You don't need to run your mouth with no education on the subject matter to look like an asshole because I assure you, you look like one anyone.
Furthermore if there's inherent value in reproductive systems of women, why on earth would men need to "prove their worth" when they are the other half of the reproductive puzzle? Not only is this illogical it seems made up by a child with very little analytical capabilities. They are both used in the process, but only one should be treated accordingly?
Men and women are generally interchangable and can be treated as equals as, no offense, you seem like a completely uneducated child and I know many men and women alike that are much smarter than you and your uneducated tripe you've laid out here kid.
I would also suggest you are an embarrassment to the species and you should talk less and read more than Jaden's Twitter feed.
And also go fuck yourself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Build one, don't be a sucker. You'll save a fuck ton of money and it's so easy to do. Helps to have a friend but you can use one of the many communities. Couple of hints, Intel is a name brand, AMD will get you what you need and save you money. Do not skimp out on your GPU. 4gb GPU should run just about everything currently released on high to ultra graphics. But look to the future. Windows wants to own the world so it's pretty easy to get for free from them rather than shell out the money. 
Just do some reading for a few weeks, put together a fake build, take it to the community, then slowly buy the parts as you see them on for decent prices. Bust out a bag of blow and a bottle of Jamieson's and then fucking COMPUTERS!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Strange to me to see a build like this for a gaming PC? Over double the capacity of the GPU put into the CPU reads more like a rendering or editing computer. Of course to each their own but would recommend ditching the Intel to save some money, ATI FX 4300 would more than kill for all triple A games and throw the money saved at the GTX 970 like others have pointed out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's amazing how willing people are to say the pasta must be plain and 'a polished turd' when we cook in a world where by that doesn't even need to be fucking pasta at all. I'm sure it's small batch and baked after a blanch, but it could be resembled pork with meat glue and formed with kelcogel for fuck sake. It could taste like literally anything. Honestly it doesn't appeal to me personally, but don't let the illiterate hillbilly "I don't eat off square plates" mentality sway your attempts at creative dining </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should learn to handle eggs. They are legit miracles. Fried, poached, coddled, scrambled, mother sauces, Zabaione, Meringue... 
They are all remarkably easy just a matter of a quick internet search and some mild practice. Eggs are readily available everywhere, quick, easy and the diversity will keep your tastebuds interested and help every meal all day long.

Other than that learn to roast potatoes properly, a lot more can be done with them but it's easy, effortless and a great side

<TEXT> Like I said I want to enjoy it. Like the comment says that's a review from the Guardian. You're in a rush to give it merit here. You can only fast travel to map locations with the double white arrows beside it, and it costs Gil. So you travel to your car. Fast travel. And then drive the rest of the way. I haven't gotten that far before giving up entirely and I noticed the advertisements. If you say more power to developers by sliding down that slope... Well may jebus have mercy on your soul. The camping... At only very limited spaces predetermined ahead of time and did nothing to help break the grind aspect. 
You're entitled to enjoy the game. But people enjoy candy crush. And that shit ain't for me </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah this is a great point. Although the guy saying use a sex theme for the next fallout is obviously a fucking retarded asshat. I feel like the reality would be to play whatever music you found and collected in the post apocalyptic world. There'd likely be much less consistency with style and genre. But whatever, a valid point. There's several mods that allow addition of music and full channels. I enjoy adding my own music and it cuts down on soooo much repitition </TEXT>

<TEXT> Desperately wish I read the Guardians review first at this point 
"If you make it past Cindy, and through the combat system, therell be something else that will get you. Perhaps it will take until the late game, where the open world is ripped away and youre forced through a series of corridors reminiscent of the worst of Final Fantasy XIII; perhaps it will be when you realise how thinly drawn the main characters actually are, living on the level of quips and catchphrases but with little in the way of backstory or motivations.

Perhaps itll be the first time the game drops a plane-load of soldiers on top of you just as youre about to finish a rare hunt, or the first time one of your allies falls off a cliff in a dungeon and runs all the way back to you, training every enemy in the area after them in one long conga-line of death. Perhaps itll be the first time you notice the insane product placement, with adverts for American Express and JapanAir in a world with no America or Japan, and an entire side quest about improving a brand of noodle.

At some point, though, itll happen, and youll realise this is the game you waited a decade for. Your heart will break. Youll move on. Youll finish the story, to see how it ends, but youll stop caring about the side quests quite so much. Youll skip through the voice acting, and just read the wiki pages for the tie-in films (which will finally explain why any of this is actually happening). Youll get to the end, and be glad you did, and be glad its over"

There's lots to enjoy, like the combat system.... And uh.... That blonde girls tits hanging out of her outfit. But only four characters, unable to name them, all of them boy band rejects...

<TEXT> There is a philosophy on civilization types. And you indeed have thought of a key aspect of it. It's believed there are a few moments all species would face and the ability to cross one into the other would dictate the likelihood of contact. The manipulation of the fundamental building blocks of nature (the atom and subatomic particles) is the one we are at and it will lead to self destruction or proliferation of a species across space at a previous unheard of rate. Should we survive instead of weaponize this moment we might yet hear from a species who has done the same. They may watch but with a danger like that they're unlikely to want to get too involved. The next civilization stage would be the manipulation of the spacial fabric of time. Fingers crossed lads </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's the sound source, presumably a TV. Have you tried headphones, does this happen with any other games? Hard to tell with such little information but it's possibly a clipping issue or normalization from the TV or a passive limiter set some how. Reset all your TV settings to defaults and game defaults and ensure your system settings don't have any normalization or weird effects on. I'm short with minimal information just do a system wide reset first </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to say it, most games suck and are just rehashed ideas with mild modifications in gameplay or aspects of character control and interaction. Original stories with independent self revolving gameplay is rare. One, maybe two games come out a year that are holding my interest. There's just the way it is now, used to be movies, now it's the game industry. Too much money, not enough story tellers </TEXT>
