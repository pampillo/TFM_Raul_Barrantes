<TEXT> These are some interesting questions I actually didn't think about.

The bouncer interpreted the painting in his own way, but it is still very vauge what message the artist, Martha, wanted the send. All she said is that she wanted to get "reactions". But for what intentions?

Why was it so important to 	emphasize on the fact that the bouncer is BIG, and all he has is muscles? Is the author trying to say that you can't judge people by their appearance?

thank you for the answer btw. You made me think

<TITLE> "Nipple Jesus" - What is it really about? confused. </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hello there.

I recently read "Nipple Jesus" by Nick Hornby and I'm slightly confused regarding the message it is trying to send. I did feel that the message was "don't judge a book by its cover" but when I searched on google, I didn't find much. All I could find is that Hornby is trying to tell how different art can be definied by different people.

Do anyone know the intentions of Nick Hornby's novel? All I could find was some "forum discussions".

Thank you in advance :D  </TEXT>

It is not my stance though. I don't know what my agenda would even be in that case since i got the impression that e-books ARE more expensive due to that specific article. But I knew that something was wrong when there was mixed comments about that topic, hence My question in this thread :"/.

How is it going to be one-sided? all I need to do in that essay is to come up with possible solutions to "increase book popularity in Sweden". are you actually being serious? :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> hey! 

This is my first time visting this sub-forum and I am actually not a regular reader, hence my question :

Are e-books actually more expensive than "real" books? I've seen the amazon "email" to  the e-book publishers that they are overcharging. 

I need someone, who actually reads alot, to confirm if e-books are generally more expensive than real books or not.

<TEXT> So I've been very interested into playing some "tbc" and these two servers seem to be the most popular at the moment, looking at this subreddit (except warmane's Outland who's going beta testing tomorrow?).

which one is recommended for someone who's into pvp?
All I've seen in this subreddit is 50/50 where some people say wargate is scumbags, and some people say hellfire is scumbags.
all I want is high pop server with pvp oriented people and alot of activity.

which one? :) thank you :D 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do have to say that "project-ascension" is a VERY promising pvp oriented vanilla server BUT with a twist.
The twist is that YOU make your own class.. You have the ability to mix spells from every class in the game and make your unique character.
There Will be THREE different servers from soft-core to hardcore server. In hardcore server it is FFS (free for all) Where everyone can kill You. This forces you to join groups, guilds etc to survive.
Other than that, the server is pretty blizzlike where You raid, bgs, arena and stuff.

It is still in beta but I do have to say that this is the most fun I've had in any private server for sure! I've been playing all night this saturday instead of actually Going out with friends. You should definitely try it out dude. Its soo much fun.

Any expansion would work for me really. Even if it is Vanilla (might be fun). 

But if there is NO instant PVP that is good atm, what is the best server you would recommend "dawsondaddy"? like people are actually investing their time HEAVILY on pvp.. 3 (TBC server would be so fucking neat though :'o ) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey..

So this is my first time posting here and I deeply apologize if this question has been asked alot, but:

Is there ANY server that has INSTANT PVP with a very big population, no p2w elements and is actually very fun to play? 
I was about to play on "http://wowsulvus.es/fusion/" but found out pretty early that it is only populated by spanish people.
So does anyone have a suggestion to where I should go?

I don't know if there has been other posts regarding this, if so: I'm sorry.

But, I've heard somewhere that the finishing product will support mods. Is this true? ARE the mods going to be limited to "battle-royale mode" or is there potential for survival mods like "dayz" and other things just like in arma3. Because that would be very neat!

<TITLE> Noob needs help for pure ! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-28 16:29:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey! So last time I played RS is when I was very young and now I'm 19 and felt the nostalgia which made me play again (but this time I know what I'm doing). I have started a pure and currently my stats are :

Attack: 41 (Goal: 60)
Strength: 42 ( Goal: 99)
Prayer: 18 (Goal : 52)
Defence: 1 (Goal: 1)
Ranged: 1 (Goal: 99)
Magic:1 (Goal 99)

But here's the problem!
I don't understand how to level up RANGE and MAGIC since so many people are telling me different things. People tell me that I made a mistake since I need to level up RANGE and MAGIC first because otherwise they will raise my combat level?

Can someone tell me just how I should do? Is there a special method I need to follow when leveling RANGE and MAGIC to not contribute to Combat level? Some people even tell me to level range with a Cannon so I don't get combat level.. but some people say that is  a bad method since I wont get any hitpoints. Some people even tell me that I shouldn't level RANGE and MAGIC at all because that is not a PURE. my head is spinning....

so please, can someone confirm for me how I can level magic and range the right way? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So basically, I have to play ALOT so I can over time recognize these block-strings.

As I mentioned earlier, I've been soo interested into guile, but many people have adviced against him since he is not top tier and is terrible for beginners... so "ryu" would be optimal.

I have no problem with ryu since I already have memorized all his special attacks that is mentioned in the game already, But still dont know IF guile is a good char.

Thank You for your advice Btw 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright. So I have been a big fan of SF for a very long time but never bothered to pick it up and try it until recentley. Just bought an Ds4 controller to my pc and trying to understand this game..

so my question is : what is more important? the "normal" attacks or the special/unique moves. I have memorized the special attacks of the characters I play but somehow I feel like you need to connect them with the "normal" attacks. But then again, I don't wanna be accused of being a ''BUTTON MASHER''. 

How do you actually know what normal attacks to press to link with the other combos. I dunno if this was a very "vauge" question. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys. straight to the point :
As a new player who only played until level 30 when the game came out.. I'm now waiting for the fresh start servers.. All I wanna do is basically PVP, PVP and once again : PVP

Now here's my question. I know that the game is grindy.. and yes I am going to go patron.. do I still need to worry about farm/land/house and all that bullshit? Because I see these threads about people terrified and are worried about something called "16x16" land and landrushes blablabla..
Is this necessary to obtain the best gear? to actually farm and obtain land? or is there other methods to achieve good gear to eventually PVP all day long.

I'm sorry if this question was stupid.. but I still want to know if this farming thingy VERY important for END content. </TEXT>
