<TEXT> For Trump, winning is and always has been the endgame. Its his identity, his mantra, his campaign promise, his aphrodisiac, his drug of choice, his raison detre. Passing Trumpcare was hasty and, by many accounts, ill-prepared  but the presidents winning narrative, the same that got him elected, got a needed, if temporary, boost. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Danish artist Thomas Dambo works on large-scale sculptures with recycled materials, having completed 25 wooden works around the world in just under three years. His latest project, The Six Forgotten Giants, is based in his hometown of Copenhagen, a project the builds and hides friendly giants throughout the citys forests. Using a treasure map, visitors can find the oversized creatures, each of which comes with a poem that describes a bit of their personality.

All of the giants are produced from recycled wood, material that was gathered by Dambo and his team from 600 pallets, a shed, an old fence, and various other sources. Using local volunteers to build the works, Dambo then names each sculpture after one of the builders

[Here's](http://southburnett.com.au/news2/2017/04/plants-can-listen-for-water/) more info:

Lead researcher Dr Monica Gagliano, from UWAs Centre of Evolutionary Biology at the School of Animal Biology, said water was a basic need for a plants survival, and the study showed that sound plays a significant role in helping plants cater to this need.

We used the common garden pea plant (Pisum sativum) as the model for our study and put the plant into a container which had two tubes at the base, giving it a choice of two directions for the growth of its roots.

We then exposed the plant to a series of sounds, including white noise, running water and then a recording of running water under each tube, and observed its behaviour.

The scientists found that the plants could tell where the source of the water was and their root systems grew towards that source based on sensing the sound of running water alone.

It also was surprising and extraordinary to see that the plant could actually tell when the sound of running water was a recording and when it was real and that the plant did not like the recorded sound, Dr Gagliano said.

She said when moisture was readily available in the soil and the plant did not need water, the plant did not respond to the sound of running water. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A research team led by the University of Bath, Cardiff University and the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology analysed the genetic structure of shorebird populations to track how they had evolved over time.

The team found that polygamous bird species, which breed with several partners during a season, are less diverse genetically within the species compared to monogamous species that only pair with one mate per season. This contradicts contemporary theories that predict rapid diversification and thus higher genetic differences between populations of polygamous shorebirds.

Researchers at the University of York say they have identified a potential link between consuming Marmite and the apparent increase of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)  a chemical messenger associated with healthy brain function.

They believe this is because Marmite is rich in vitamin B12, which encourages the body to produce the neurotransmitter that regulates the delicate balance of activity needed to maintain a healthy brain.

Study author Dr Daniel Baker, from the universitys department of psychology, said: Marmite contains several substances associated with the production of GABA, an important neurotransmitter.

We reasoned that consuming these might increase GABA levels more effectively than consuming GABA itself as this molecule cannot easily pass into the brain from the blood and is likely to be broken down in the digestive system.

Researchers tested 28 healthy volunteers, half of which were assigned to the active Marmite group while the rest were placed in a control group who consumed peanut butter.

They measured each participants response to visual stimuli and recorded electrical activity in the brain using electroencephalography (EEG). Those who ate a teaspoon of Marmite every day for a month showed a 30% decrease in their brains response to visual patterns.

GABA functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, sending chemical messages through the brain and the nervous system while blocking nerve impulses. Its role is to reduce the excitability of the neurons or nerve cells and help maintain a healthy brain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is Sisis first official state visit to Washington as Egypts president. Thats because although the US has long viewed Egypt as a vital strategic ally in the Middle East, President Obama steadfastly refused to meet with the Egyptian strongman over concerns about serious human rights abuses carried out by Sisis security forces  including torture, mass detention, and forced disappearances of journalists, aid workers, activists, students, and Islamists. In one particularly gruesome incident, a 28-year-old PhD student from Italy studying in Cairo was abducted, tortured, and murdered in what many believe was an attack by Egyptian state security forces.

Clearly, Trump  whose lavish praise for another repressive dictator, Vladimir Putin, has already raised eyebrows  isnt bothered by any of that. For Trump, all that matters is that Sisi is a tough leader who has done what Trump seems to think is a bang-up job of fighting terrorism in Egypt and who is one of Israels closest allies in the Middle East.

Speaking to reporters Monday after meeting with Sisi, Trump said, We agree on so many things. I just want to let everybody know in case there was any doubt that we are very much behind President el-Sisi. He's done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Allings modest boat was left on the coast of the Bering Strait in 1929. It would be the last physical trace of her that anyone was able to definitively identify. If she made it back into Russia, it would have been difficult for word to come back to the curious residents of Dawson City or any of the other towns she had passed through. At minimum, she had walked 5000 miles, with the spacing of the linesman cabins indicating she had often logged as much as 30 miles a day.

For decades, Alaska's Bering coast was where Allings story ended. Then, in 1972, an author named Francis Dickie published an account of Allings trip in True West magazine. Shortly thereafter, Dickie heard from a reader named Arthur Elmore who wrote in with a compelling postscript. Moore claimed that he had visited a town called Yakutsk in Siberia some seven years earlier. There, Elmore met up with a friend who had been in the Russian town of Provideniya in 1930.

Moores friend relayed the tale of a woman in tattered clothing who had been standing near the shore of the Bering Strait surrounded by native people from the Diomede Islands, which lie in between Alaska and Siberia. The entire party was being questioned by officials, who were suspicious of the visitors.

He overheard the woman talking about how she was an outsider in America and felt like she had to make a journey back home. She had walked a great distance, she said, but finally made it.
No one can say with certainty the woman of Elmores story was Lillian Alling. But to think she had spent years in dogged pursuit of her goal only to perish so close to the end seems improbable. Only about 50 miles of the Strait remained, and Alling had proven herself to be resourceful and stubborn beyond belief. Having come so far, the mists of the Bering and its dangerous waters seem inconsequential. For what little we truly know about Alling, one thing is a certainty: She would do anything to get home.

<TEXT> The new documents released Tuesday by Ukrainian lawmaker Sergei Leshchenko appear to show an invoice for $750,000 from Manaforts Alexandria, Va.-based consulting firm, Davis Manafort, addressed to Neocom Systems Ltd., a company registered in Belize. The bill was for the purchase of 501 computers. Leshchenko presented the documents in a news conference Tuesday morning in Kiev, saying the invoice contained signatures and stamps from Manafort that matched those available in other documents already made public.

Leshchenko then pointed to a copy of a page in the black ledger listing a payment of $750,000 on Oct. 14, 2009, issued to Manafort.

This is a case of fraud, and it proves that the party and Yanukovych used fake reasons to pay their consultant, Leshchenko said. These documents should be investigated.

When asked whether U.S. law enforcement agencies had contacted him about the documents, which first were reported by the New York Times on Monday, Leshchenko said, No comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chand Baori is one of the oldest and most attractive landmarks in Rajasthan.  It was built by King Chanda of the Chauhan Dynasty between AD 800 and AD 900 and was dedicated to Hashat Mata, Goddess of Joy and Happiness upon completion.

The state of Rajasthan is extremely arid, and the design and final structure of Chand Baori was intended to conserve as much water as possible. At the bottom of the well, the air remains 5-6 degrees cooler than at the surface, and Chand Baori was used as a community gathering place for locals during periods of intense heat.  One side of the well has a pavilion and resting room for the royals.

Hes accused an allied government of surveillance, and if recent reporting is any indication, he is convinced of the reality of a wiretapping plot, despite all evidence to the contrary. Its extraordinary behavior, compounded by the fact that Trump lies with unprecedented ease and frequency.

<TEXT> The Eskimo Nebula (NGC 2392), also known as the Clownface Nebula[3] or Caldwell 39, is a bipolar double-shell planetary nebula (PN). It was discovered by astronomer William Herschel in 1787. The formation resembles a person's head surrounded by a parka hood. It is surrounded by gas that composed the outer layers of a Sun-like star. The visible inner filaments are ejected by a strong wind of particles from the central star. The outer disk contains unusual light-year-long filaments.

'Treasure' is defined as being:

All coins from the same hoard. A hoard is defined as two or more coins, as long as they are at least 300 years old when found. If they contain less than 10% gold or silver there must be at least 10 in the hoard for it to qualify.

Two or more prehistoric base metal objects in association with one another

Any individual (non-coin) find that is at least 300 years old and contains at least 10% gold or silver.

Associated finds: any object of any material found in the same place as (or which had previously been together with) another object which is deemed treasure.

Objects substantially made from gold or silver but are less than 300 years old, that have been deliberately hidden with the intention of recovery and whose owners or heirs are unknown. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "I thought there would be one court date. I thought I would show up and the judge would look at this and say. This is absurd and it would be over," said McLafferty speaking at the Legislative Office Building in Albany.

McLafferty has been defending the case for two years and it's cost her over ten thousand dollars.

Brooklyn Assemblywoman Maritza Davila calls it an abuse of power and that's why she's introducing Collette's Law.

"I don't think that should happen to anyone just because you graduated from a law school," said Davila, D-Bushwick.

The bill would require the plaintiff to pay for the defense's legal fees if a judge rules a suit "abusive".  The assemblywoman says abusive suits are filed all the time.

The lawsuit against Collette was finally dropped after two years.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Japan has a rich tradition of food carving called mukimono. If youve ever eaten at a fancy restaurant in Japan you might have found a carrot carved into a bunny, garnishing your plate. But in the hands of Japanese artist Gaku, the art of fruit and vegetable carving is elevated to a new realm of edible creations.

One constraint to carving fruits and vegetables is that sometimes you must work fast. The moment a peel is removed, oxidization will start to discolor your artwork. So, depending on the variety, Gakus carvings are probably created within several minutes. Armed with a tool similar to an x-acto knife and a fruit or vegetable from the grocery store, Gaku carves intricate patterns that are often inspired by traditional Japanese motifs.

Gaku points out that the banana is great fruit to practice with because its cheap and easy to carve. When asked what he does with all his creations after hes done, his reply is simple: he eats them. Except for the banana peel.

<TEXT> The Walled Off hotel may sound utilitarian, even bleak. Its owner says it has the worst view of any hotel in the world, while its 10 rooms get just 25 minutes of direct sunlight a day.

But, nestled against the controversial barrier wall separating Israel from the Palestinian territories, the West Banks answer to the Waldorf offers travellers something more elusive than any luxury destination.

The lodging in Bethlehem is a hotel, museum, protest and gallery all in one, packed with the artworks and angry brilliance of its owner, British street artist Banksy.

But today, some Republicans who are skeptical of Trump would understand  and even applaud  the move. And of course they would become heroes to millions of Americans who fear for their futures under this president. It's also very likely that in the future, history would look back kindly on their courage in defense of the republic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Women in the U.S. are routinely killed by their husbands, boyfriends, ex-husbands and ex-boyfriends.  These incidents are typically experienced as individual cases, and not folded into a broader phenomenon of urgent concern, with blame attributed to a particular religion or culture.  

Different explanations surface for cases of violence against women, depending upon the identity of the perpetrator.  Bad acts by Muslim immigrants are blamed on Islam; bad acts by white non-Muslim Americans are ascribed to individual deviancy or psychological pressures.  

Gendered violence by Muslim immigrants is attributed to the category of honor crime, fortifying the presumption that there is something unusually misogynistic about Muslim societies; the same categorical attribution does not happen with gendered violence by white non-Muslim Americans.

<TEXT> In 2014, Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant contacted conceptual design studio Lernert   Sander to create a piece for a special documentary photography issue about food. Lernert   Sander responded with this somewhat miraculous photo of 98 unprocessed foods cut into extremely precise 2.5cm cubes aligned on a staggered grid. Looking at the shot it seems practically impossible, but the studio confirms it is indeed the real thing.

<TEXT> Mr. Trump cant be bothered to recognize black people as fully human. He seems to see black American life as a never-ending barrage of gunfire on bombed-out city blocks. The black people closst to him are celebrities who share and reinforce that view. This fantastical narrative obscures the real problems facing black communities, like housing and employment discrimination, divestment from education, over-policing, depressed wages and poisoned water. </TEXT>

Donald Trump's well documented misogyny and vulgarity disqualifies him from being received by Her Majesty the Queen or the Prince of Wales. Therefore during the term of his presidency Donald Trump should not be invited to the United Kingdom for an official State Visit.

I love how there aren't any conditions at all.  Just a straight up "nope" for as long as he's president. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the last 6 years, Scottish wildlife photographer Alan McFadyen spent an estimated 4,200 hours seeking the perfect shot: a symmetrical image of a kingfisher diving into its own refelection in search of prey. Last month, after 720,000 exposures he finally got it. McFadyen certainly snapped hundreds of other successful images along the way, but this particular photoas it existed in his imaginationeluded him for years.

Kingfishers dive so fast they are like bullets, so taking a good photo requires a lot of luck  and a lot of patience, McFadyen told the Daily Mail. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that female kingfishers only rarely dive, so timing is essential.

<TEXT> Common prey of great white sharks, Cape fur seals normally feast on small fish, squid and crabs. But instead of going for the bait, this young seal turned its ravenous attention to the blue sharks, some of which were up to 4.5 feet long, or about the same size as the seal. The seal first snatched one shark, tearing open its abdominal cavity and feeding on the dark viscera inside. Then it went for another, and another. Fearing for his tourists safety, Fallows sent them back to the vessel. But he stayed to witness the scene, photographing the seal as it killed and consumed five of the ten sharks. He left before the seal had finished its meal, afraid that his presence was somehow aggravating the situation. Sharks of this size are certainly not usually considered food for seals, Fallows (the photographer) said at the time.

The president is responding to a claim of fact not by denying the fact, but by denying the claim that facts are supposed to have on an argument.

He isnt telling OReilly that hes got his facts wrong. Hes saying that, as far as he is concerned, facts, as most people understand the term, dont matter: That they are indistinguishable from, and interchangeable with, opinion; and that statements of fact neednt have any purchase against a man who is either sufficiently powerful to ignore them or sufficiently shameless to deny them  or, in his case, both </TEXT>

<TEXT> How can Trumps self-defeating behavior be explained? One theory, subscribed to by a number of mental-health professionals, is that he suffers from a narcissistic-personality disorder that prevents him from turning the other cheek. Whenever anybody crosses him or says anything critical about him, this theory goes, Trump suffers narcissistic injuryan intense feeling that his entire self-worth has been called into question. And this prompts him to lash out, regardless of the consequences. John Garner, a Baltimore psychotherapist, has launched an online petition that says Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States. So far, more than twenty thousand mental-health workers have signed the petition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> from 2013:

An unusual type of solar eclipse occurred last year. Usually it is the Earths Moon that eclipses the Sun. Last June, most unusually, the planet Venus took a turn. Like a solar eclipse by the Moon, the phase of Venus became a continually thinner crescent as Venus became increasingly better aligned with the Sun. Eventually the alignment became perfect and thephase of Venus dropped to zero. The dark spot of Venus crossed our parent star. The situation could technically be labeled a Venusian annular eclipse with an extraordinarily large ring of fire. Pictured above during the occultation, the Sun was imaged in three colors of ultraviolet light by the Earth-orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory, with the dark region toward the right corresponding to a coronal hole. Hours later, as Venus continued in its orbit, a slight crescent phase appeared again. The next Venusian solar eclipse will occur in 2117.

Friedman says that the filter (called a Hydrogen Alpha filter) he uses blocks everything but a very narrow slice of the deep red end of the visible spectrum. After attaching the filter to the front of his 3 1/2-inch telescope (the equivalent of a 450mm f/5 telephoto lens), he uses an industrial webcam to capture the photos. The camera can capture images at 15fps to 120fps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh yes, the five year-old boy has diabolical plans. Look at him, standing in the airport. He is not even four feet high, but his mind is whirling with plans: to go to a strange new school and learn a strange new language and make strange new friends and teach them draw incendiary graffiti allover the walls with crayon.And atrecess, he may notshare.He has plans tosit up past bedtime in a house where the sound of bombs falling does not keephim awake. He has plans tocommit awful acts of sabotage like flushing strange things down the toilet, because here there is a toilet to flush. He has plans to grow up to become the most terrifying thing in the world: an American.

<TEXT> Built by engineer Konstantin Zverev in the 1870s, Fort Zverev now lies in ruins, with machine gun mounts, bunkers, and water tubes slowly rusting away.

But the part of Fort Zverev that feels truly nightmarish lies in the basement area, where in the 1970s, a fire erupted. However this wasnt just any fire.

In this basement they stored a Russian alternative to napalm, and when it caught fire it reached temperatures of over 2000, so hot in fact, that it literally melted the brick above it. In doing so it created a sort of artificial cave of red brick stalactites dripping down from above.

<TEXT> Angel Oak is a Southern live oak (Quercus virginiana) located in Angel Oak Park on Johns Island near Charleston, South Carolina. Angel Oak is estimated to be 500 years old. It stands 66.5 ft (20 m) tall, measures 28 ft (8.5 m) in circumference, and produces shade that covers 17,200 square feet (1,600 m2). Its longest branch distance is 187 ft. in length

The oak derives its name from the estate of Justus Angel (an African American slave owner) and his wife, Martha Waight Tucker Angel. Local folklore tells stories of ghosts of former slaves appearing as angels around the tree

<TEXT> Paper artist Matthew Shlian combines his talent for sculpture with a knack for engineering, producing geometric works that are composed of tight-knit tessellations. Shlians receptively folded works have lead to collaborations with scientists at the University of Michigan, together working to visualize research by translating paper structures to micro folds.

Researchers see paper engineering as a metaphor for scientific principals; I see their inquiry as a basis for artistic inspiration, said Shlian in an artist statement on his website. In my studio I am a collaborator, explorer and inventor. I begin with a system of folding and at a particular moment the material takes over.

On Saturday he decided that Lewis should be no different, using Twitter to say that he should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results.

<TEXT> It is found along the southern and western coasts of Australia. The name is derived from the appearance, with long leaf-like protrusions coming from all over the body. These protrusions are not used for propulsion; they serve only as camouflage. The leafy seadragon propels itself by means of a pectoral fin on the ridge of its neck and a dorsal fin on its back closer to the tail end. These small fins are almost completely transparent and difficult to see as they undulate minutely to move the creature sedately through the water, completing the illusion of floating seaweed.

Popularly known as "leafies", it is the marine emblem of the state of South Australia and a focus for local marine conservation.

<TEXT> Artist Suzanne Moxhay produces photomontage scenes which seem to effortlessly combine elements from both her own photography practice and her large archive of collected images. To compose her taken and collected photographs, Moxhay relies on a film technique dating back to the early 20th century called matte painting, a process where backdrops are illustrated on glass panels and integrated into live-action sets. Using this method she creates the illusion that all of her disparate pictures are one cohesive image, first arranging the fragments on glass, then re-photographing the new configuration, and finally touching up the compositions digitally.

<TEXT> Monastic activity on the island:

The monastery's exact date of foundation is not known. The first definite reference to monastic activity on the island is a record of the death of "Suibhini of Skelig" dating from the 8th century; however, Saint Fionn is claimed to have founded the monastery in the 6th century.

The monastic site on the island is on a terraced shelf 600 feet (180 metres) above sea level, and developed between the sixth and eighth centuries. It contains six beehive cells, two oratories as well as a number of stone crosses and slabs. It also contains a later medieval church. The cells and oratories are all of dry-built corbel construction. A carefully designed system for collecting and purifying water in cisterns was developed. It has been estimated that no more than twelve monks and an abbot lived here at any one time. A hermitage is on the south peak.

The diet of monks living on the North Atlantic islands was somewhat different from that of those who lived on the mainland. With less arable land available to grow grain, vegetable gardens became an important part of monastic life. Of necessity, fish and the meat and eggs of birds nesting on the islands became staples.

The "Annals of Inisfallen" record a Viking attack in 823. The site had been dedicated to Saint Michael by at least 1044 (when the death of "Aedh of Scelic-Mhich" is recorded). However, this dedication may have occurred as early as 950, around which time a new church was added to the monastery (typically done to celebrate a consecration) which was called Saint Michael's Church.

The monastery remained continuously occupied until the 12th or 13th century. During this time, the climate around Skellig Michael became colder and more prone to storms, and this, along with changes to the structure of the Irish Church, prompted the community to abandon the island and move to the abbey in Ballinskelligs.

<TEXT> Blooms are 3-D printed sculptures designed to animate when spun under a strobe light. Unlike a 3D zoetrope, which animates a sequence of small changes to objects, a bloom animates as a single self-contained sculpture. The blooms animation effect is achieved by progressive rotations of the golden ratio, phi (), the same ratio that nature employs to generate the spiral patterns we see in pinecones and sunflowers. The rotational speed and strobe rate of the bloom are synchronized so that one flash occurs every time the bloom turns 137.5 (the angular version of phi).

<TEXT> While renovating the Government Center subway station in Boston, construction workers came across a hollow section of concrete... Inside, there was a red-and-blue ball of dirty cloth. Unfurled, the ball turned into an even creepier find: two cloaks, dotted with stars, with ghoulish masks stitched into them.

Its not clear where these trash wizards came from, but the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) does know that this section of concrete was poured 60 years ago, which means that these cloaks have been there for decades.

<TEXT> Francesco Albanos human body sculptures drip, melt, hang, and often appear to be boneless  even the work primarily featuring bones is distorted and lumpy. Working with wax, polyester, latex, iron, and other materials, Albano sculpts shapes and contortions that render the erect and boundaried body flaccid and grotesque.
Albano is interested in and influenced by a wide range of subjects from philosophical, mystical and spiritual arguments to scientific theories, from psychological studies to real life stories. Albano uses skin and bone as a critical and personal tool of expression to focus on the effect of societal pressures and psychological violence on the human body and collective conscience. More than an inner envelope the artist defines the human skin as a limit and an identity, that interacts with outer world.

<TEXT> [More info](http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/victoria-s-way-indian-sculpture-park):

Covering 22 acres, the park includes a series of dancing figures of Ganesh, Shiva, and other Hindu deities. It also includes more bizarre sculptures of a skeletal Buddha-like figure, an enormous disembodied finger, and a sculpture called The Split Man which shows a figure ripping itself in two, representing the mental state of the dysfunctional human.

Intended to represent the spiritual progression to enlightenment, this collection of 14 statues took 20 years to complete. A plaque dedicates the park to mathematician Alan Turing.

The park was known as Victorias Way until 2015, when it was closed by the owner, who stated, Too may day-trippers came turned it into a fun park for parents with children. It was designed as a contemplative garden for over 28s. It was reopened in 2016 as Victors Way (reverting to its original name) with new age restrictions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mortsafes were contraptions designed to protect graves from disturbance. Resurrectionists had supplied the schools of anatomy in Scotland since the early 18th century. This was due to the necessity for medical students to learn anatomy by attending dissections of human subjects, which was frustrated by the very limited allowance of dead bodies - for example the corpses of executed criminals - granted by the government, which controlled the supply

For him, its not about the combination of different temperatures, but different colours and flavours. He manages to get seven of them (sometimes even 10) in one glass (around 1), all lining up like a dusky rainbow. Each sip delivers a different taste, from syrupy sweet to spicy cloves.

Tara Bradshaw, a spokeswoman for Mnuchin, said about 178,000 loans were already in the foreclosure process when he took over the bank and renamed it OneWest. Bradshaw said he oversaw 101,000 mortgage modification offers, some of which forgave part of borrowers' principal balance. Mnuchin sold OneWest to CIT Group in 2015 for more than double what he paid for it. </TEXT>

In an attempt to find more creative ways to capture the variety of species that flew through her backyard, Lisa purchased the Bird Photo Booth 2.0. The device uses a motion detector to snap its shutter, capturing birds with a macro lens at ten images per second.

<TEXT> The Catacombs of Paris (French: Catacombes de Paris, are underground ossuaries in Paris, France, which hold the remains of more than six million people in a small part of the ancient Mines of Paris tunnel network. Located south of the former city gate "Barrire dEnfer" (Gate of Hell) beneath Rue de la Tombe-Issoire, the ossuary was founded when city officials had two simultaneous problems: a series of cave-ins beginning 1774, and overflowing cemeteries, particularly Saint Innocents. Nightly processions of bones from 1786 to 1788 transferred remains from cemeteries to the reinforced tunnels, and more remains were added during later years. The underground cemetery became a tourist attraction on a small scale from the early 19th century, and has been open to the public on a regular basis since 1874 with surface access from a building at Place Denfert-Rochereau in the extreme southern part of the city of Paris.

<TEXT> Original version of the brochure targeted Chinese visitors explicitly and was revised following a backlash:



Following a rash of bad experiences with foreign visitors, the Hokkaido Tourism Organization released an educational brochure last summer aimed at making some subtle cultural differences slightly more explicit. After complaints that it was patronizing and maybe a little too explicit, they recently revised it, and added an English-language version as well, Japan Times reports.


The old guide, Common Sense When Traveling Hokkaido, was released last August, in Chinese only. It featured multiple illustrations of bad tourist behaviorthrowing used toilet paper in the trash; wearing pajamas in the lobbymarked as such with giant red Xs. When Chinese tourists complained that this was patronizing, the bureau softened their tone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Students at Bridge Farm Primary School in Bristol, UK returned from their half-term holiday to find one of the school's buildings had been adorned with an unsual piece of giant doodle art. Yet this image was no act of vandalism - it's the latest masterpiece from street art legend Banksy.

Depicting a child playing with a stick and a hoop, the artwork looks like it's leapt from the margins of a school exercise book. Of course, because this is a Banksy there's an edgy touch, with the traditional hoop swapped out for a burning tyre.

However, there's a charming side to the story, as the children at the school had recently decided to rename their houses after Bristol legends, including Banksy.

Bridge Farm wrote to the artist about the decision to name a school house after him and the painting was reportedly completed last night. As well as a letter from the artist himself that confirms he made the image, the painting also features the rare inclusion of his signature.

<TEXT> A month after losing control of the governorship, Republicans in North Carolina on Wednesday launched a brazen power grab to deprive the state's incoming Democratic governor of the ability to control much of the state government, from the election board to the governor's own Cabinet.

After calling a surprise special session with just a few hours' notice, Republicans in the Legislature introduced a series of bills that would strip the next governor, Roy Cooper, of the power to control the state's election boards and to appoint University of North Carolina trustees, and would give the state Senate veto power over his Cabinet picks. The legislation would drastically reduce the number of political appointees the new governor can hire and fire, meaning Cooper would not be able to replace more than 1,000 political appointees of the outgoing administration. If passed, the legislation would undermine the results of the gubernatorial election by severely weakening the office of the governor.

I'd call them sore losers, but the implications for democracy in NC are a lot more serious and scary than that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Clinton, not Trump, was the conservative candidate in 2016, while Trump was the far-right reactionary. And if the cabinet that president-elect Trump has put together so far is any indication, the policies of the Trump administration will be just as extreme and reactionary as many of us feared. Likewise, if his recent behavior is any guide, he will be just as unpredictable and demagogic in office as he was on the campaign trail. </TEXT>

Experts I spoke to say any arrangement in which Trump continues to involve his children in his finances  the plan previously put forward by Trump's campaign  will fail to accomplish that task. Trump has compounded conflict concerns of late by moving to put his children in charge his fortune while still involving them in his soon-to-be presidency in a significant  and even unprecedented  way. </TEXT>

Sutton said the fish likely doesn't have a sting (as some outlets have suggested), but is definitely scaleless. And the translucent fangs sticking out of the fish's mouth? They're used to catch food.

"When you live in the deep ocean not much food around you cant afford to miss a meal, and you gotta really get it," Sutton said. "That means their teeth are out of proportion to their size."

The "hairy" pincers contain filamentous bacteria, which the creature may use to detoxify poisonous minerals from the water emitted by the hydrothermal vents where it lives. This process is known as chemosynthesis. Alternatively, it may feed on bacteria, although it is generally thought to be a carnivore.

<TEXT> Racket is the standard spelling of the word. Racquet is an alternative spelling used more commonly in certain sports (squash, racquetball, badminton) and less commonly in others (tennis).  Racket is the preferred spelling in tennis.  While some writers, especially those outside North America, prefer the French-influenced racquet, racket is the predominant spelling by a large margin, except among the occasional snobby Redditor such as the infamous Mr_Zoovaska.  Similarly, while some believe that racket came about as a misspelling of racquet, racket is in fact the older spelling: it has been in use since the 16th century, with racquet only showing up later in the 19th century as a variant of racket.  

Put that in your motherfucking pipe and smoke it.  First argument I've won in over a week, so please excuse the overreaction.

<TEXT> "One of the problems that the Democrats have had is they have not perceived the reality that, despite the fact we're better off today than we were eight years ago economically, there are millions of people who are working longer hours for low wages," says Sanders. "People who have seen a significant decline in their standard of living. We've got to stand with those people and take on the 1 percent, take on the billionaire class and create a government and an economy that works for people."

<TEXT> The team discovered these speech patterns using a new type of waterproof microphone called a hydrophone. This allowed them to record two dolphins at the reserve - named Yasha and Yana - with a high level of detail.

After analysing these recordings, the team says they've found evidence that the dolphins were forming 'words', by emitting different pulses that varied in frequency, volume level, and spectrum, just like human language.

While it's impossible to know at this stage what these words could mean, the team says the dolphins appeared to be forming sentences up to five words in length during their brief conversation.

There's even evidence of grammatical structures in place too, which would allow for more complex sentences, but more evidence is needed to confirm this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the days following the election, Trump expressed deep frustration about how Christie was handling the transition. In particular, he vented about how the governor had loaded up the team with lobbyists, the very class of people Trump had campaigned against, with his calls to drain the swamp in Washington. The president-elect also noticed that Christie had stocked his team with old New Jersey friends and allies.

There were other issues. Once the dust settled from their surprise win, the Trump team noticed that Christie had done little to vet potential administration picks or to dig into potential conflicts of interests. With Democrats eager to pounce on any early mistake, it was an oversight they simply couldnt afford. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the only living bird species that specializes in feeding on marrow. The bearded vulture can swallow whole or bite through brittle bones up to the size of a lamb's femur[10] and its powerful digestive system quickly dissolves even large pieces. The bearded vulture has learned to crack bones too large to be swallowed by carrying them in flight to a height of 50150 m (160490 ft) above the ground and then dropping them onto rocks below, which smashes them into smaller pieces and exposes the nutritious marrow.

<TEXT> Recently on view as part of Sculpture by the Sea in Bondi, this unusual figurative sculpture by artist Alessandra Rossi seems to have captured the imagination of many, becoming one of the most popular pieces of this years exhibition. Titled Untitled (coral), Rossi says the piece depicting a solitary young girl in a dress is inspired in part by the phenomenon of coral bleaching, something that occurs in nature when ocean water becomes too warm and coral begins to expel an algae giving it a white appearance. Additionally, the work grapples with modern issues of identity, functioning as a metaphor for the patination and discoloration of emotion engendered by the digital era.

The sculptures translucent layered appearance changes dramatically when viewed from different angles during the day and at times almost vanishes against the horizon of Bondi beach.

<TEXT> Caption by Paul Souders for his [award winning](http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/2013/12/19/the-2013-national-geographic-photography-contest-winners/) photo taken in Hudson Bay:

A polar bear peers up from beneath the melting sea ice on Hudson Bay as the setting midnight sun glows red from the smoke of distant fires during a record-breaking spell of hot weather. The Manitoba population of polar bears, the southernmost in the world, is particularly threatened by a warming climate and reduced sea ice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Historians may find themselves most mystified by the politicians who refused to say anything. Sen.Patrick J. Toomey is running for reelection in Pennsylvania. He is asking voters for their trust. Yet he will not tell them for whom he will vote in the presidential election. Apparently he believes, as Mr. Heck insisted last week, that his vote is a personal decision.

No, it is not a personal decision; it is a test of judgment. The politics may be difficult for down-ballot Republicans, but the choice, on the merits, is not. Mr. Trump is a menace to the nation. Many high-ranking Republican officials understand this. Some chose to act forthrightly in this knowledge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Republican nominee has shown little regard for the safety of journalists while stirring the crowd into an anti-press frenzy.  

His supporters taunts range from chanting CNN sucks to using anti-Semitic language and imagery (which have also been used to target journalists on social media).  

Reporters found a swastika waiting for them at the press table at a Florida rally, while a Trump supporter in Ohio called out the Lgenpresse, a Nazi term used to discredit the lying press.

Days later, in Phoenix, a Trump supporter chanted Jew S.A. at reporters. And on Wednesday in Miami, a Trump supporter accused reporters of selling out for a few shekels.

<TEXT> Trump has vowed to run the country the way he runs his businesses, and Trump Toronto is yet another reminder that his businesses do not always run smoothly. Even before the bankruptcy, the Trump Organization was already mired in litigation over management issues with the projects owner, Talon Internationalled by Alex Shnaider, the steel magnate who is perhaps better known for buying a Formula One racing team and hiring Justin Bieber to sing at his daughters Sweet Sixteen. The project also faced lawsuits filed by middle-class investors who claim they were suckered into buying time-share-style units in the hotel with wildly overstated projections of Trump Torontos performance. Now its in receivership, which will produce new ownership and, quite possibly, a new brand.

Any chance Trump has "wildly overstated" his own projections of his ability to be an effective president?  God help us all if this shitbird pulls off the upset. </TEXT>

<TEXT> College publishers figured out that, to improve their margins, all they had to do were two things: raise prices and release new editions of the same text, forcing students to buy new textbooks even if, in many cases, they didn't need them.

Another factor? Improved printing technology, which led to more visuals.

In the 1960s, for example, it was somewhat uncommon for a textbook to have much in the way of pictures. Some books, like Knopf's History of the Modern World, had just a handful of pictures in their nearly 1,000 pages.

But by the 1980s, this changed, a change that at first was seen as generally positive for students, according to a 1986 study done by Georgia State University researchers Brenda D. Smith and Joan M. Elifson. The duo noted the picture-free material tended to be comprehended just as well as material with pictures, but students preferred the more vibrant option.

"Student preference proved to be overwhelmingly in favor of pictures," the researchers wrote. "Of the 145 students, 119 chose the passage with pictures, while only 26 chose the passage without pictures."

Soon enough, if you were a textbook publisher, you couldn't get away with just two colors anymore, and the number of pictures in textbooks increased dramatically between the 1960s and 1980s, and, with that, of course, also costs.

<TEXT> The potential impact of these "small barriers" is exactly why there's so much controversy over the new wave of voter ID laws that has swept the country in recent years. Voting rights advocates say they can make participation harder, especially for the low-income Americans and members of racial minority groups who are less likely to have the identification required. Exacerbating the issue, confused or poorly trained poll workers have been known to demand even more identification than the laws in their states require. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Japanese paper artist Chie Hitotsuyama deftly creates textured sculptures of animals using a technique involving rolled strips of wet newspaper. The compact application of each newspaper segment proves to be an elegant method of forming the wild fur of snow monkeys or the density of scales found on the back of an iguana. For Hitotsuyama, these details are critical as she seeks to create the most lifelike sculptures possible.

Some other pretty creepy pics in the article.

The women disguised in special (and fairly creepy) dried grass or "rock suits" were student military camouflage artists, or camoufleurs, of the Womens Reserve Camouflage Corps, a forgotten division of the National League for Womens Service.

Female artists across the United States joined the ranks of this highly specialized military group in New York to help with the war effort during World War I. They used their creativity and crafting skills to develop designs and patterns that mimicked the landscape to provide soldiers with added protection.

Seeking to make bike paths safer and more accessible in the evening and night hours, urban planners in Lidzbark Warminski, Poland just unveiled a new glow-in-the-dark bike lane. The path is made from small crystal-like particles of phosphor called luminophores that charge during sunlight hours and can glow for up to 10 hours.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [backstory](http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-not-an-alien-2013-5):

The tiny mummified skeleton has been baffling researchers since it was discovered in the Atacama desert region of Chile.

One thing seems pretty sure so far: It's not a monkey, and it's not an alien.

The face you see is totally and completely human. It was born with a birth defect.

The child measures only six inches tall, but researcher Garry Nolan, of Stanford University, says it could have lived to be about six to eight years old at the time of its death. The body has been lovingly given the name "Ata" based on where it was found. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In all, the Trump campaigns payments to Trump-owned businesses account for about 7 percent of its $119 million spending total, the analysis found.

Thats an unprecedented amount of self-dealing in federal politics. Even the wealthiest of candidates have refrained from tapping their businesses resources to such an extensive degree, either because their businesses are structured in a manner that doesnt legally allow them to do it with flexibility, or because theyre leery of the allegations of pocket-padding that inevitably arise when politicians use their campaigns or committees to pay their businesses or families.

Difference being that many of those other candidates actually give a tin shit about appearances (and a handful of them also about ethics), not just cramming their pockets full of money.

<TEXT> C. exigua extracts blood through the claws on its front, causing the tongue to atrophy from lack of blood. The parasite then replaces the fish's tongue by attaching its own body to the muscles of the tongue stub.  The fish is able to use the parasite just like a normal tongue. It appears that the parasite does not cause any other damage to the host fish. Once C. exigua replaces the tongue, some feed on the host's blood and many others feed on fish mucus.[clarification needed] This is the only known case of a parasite functionally replacing a host organ. When a host fish dies, C. exigua will detach itself from the tongue stub after some time, leave the fish's mouth cavity, and can then be seen clinging to its head or body externally. It is not fully known what then happens to the parasite in the wild.

<TEXT> St. Vitalis of Assisi, O.S.B. (Italian: San Vitale de Assisi) (1295  May 31, 1370), was an Italian hermit and monk. Born in Bastia Umbra, Vitalis as a youth was licentious and immoral. However, he attempted to expiate his sins by going on pilgrimage to various sanctuaries in Italy and Europe. When he returned to Umbria, he became a Benedictine monk at Subiaco.

Vitalis then spent the rest of his life in the hermitage of Santa Maria di Viole, near Assisi, in utter poverty. His one possession was an old container that he used to drink water from a nearby spring. His reputation for holiness soon spread after his death. He was known as a patron against sicknesses and diseases affecting the bladder and genitals.

On 29 May 2011, a head preserved as a relic, allegedly that of this saint, was offered at auction with an estimate of 1,000 at Annesbrook House, Duleek, County Meath, Ireland. It was sold to an unnamed movie star from Los Angeles, California, for 3,500.

<TEXT> This was the scene of [Heirens' second murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Heirens#Murders):

On December 10, 1945, Frances Brown, a divorced woman, was discovered with a knife lodged in her neck and bullet wound to the head in her apartment at 3941 North Pine Grove Avenue, Chicago, after a cleaning woman heard a radio playing loudly and noted Brown's partly open door. Brown had been savagely stabbed, and authorities thought that a burglar had been discovered or interrupted. No valuables were taken, but someone had written a message in lipstick on the wall of Brown's apartment:

**For heavens
Sake catch me
Before I kill more
I cannot control myself**

Police found a bloody fingerprint smudge on the doorjamb of the entrance door. Also, there was a possible eyewitness to the killer's escape. An "eye-witness", George Weinberg, heard gunshots at about 4 am. According to John Derick, the night clerk stationed in the lobby of the building, a nervous man of 3540 years old and weighing approximately 140 pounds got off the elevator, fumbled for the door to the street and left.

Four days after the murder, the Chicago Police announced they had reason to believe the killer was a woman. </TEXT>

Many consumers hadn't noticed the gradual rise in price, however, because the company often only added in 9 to 15 percent each time and insurance companies had made up the difference. But with recent changes in the deductible structure and co-pays for some health plans that have put more of the cost for drugs on consumers, many families have been hit with sticker shock. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Hilliard):

(happened in Minnesota)

On December 20, 1980, Jean Hilliard was involved in a car accident which resulted in car failure in sub zero temperatures. She walked to a friend's house 2 miles away and collapsed 15 feet outside of the door. Temperatures dropped to -22 F (-30 C) and she was found frozen solid at 7 a.m. after six hours in the cold. She was transported to Fosston Hospital where doctors said her skin was too hard to pierce with a hypodermic needle and her body temperature was too low to register on a thermometer. Her face was ashen and her eyes were solid with no response to light. Her pulse was slowed to approximately 12 beats per minute.


She was wrapped in an electric blanket. After 49 days she left the hospital with no permanent damage to the brain or body besides frostbite.

<TEXT> To maintain the precise condition of Lenin's body, the staff must perform regular maintenance on the corpse and sometimes even replace parts with an excruciating attention to detail. Artificial eyelashes have taken the place of Lenin's original eyelashes, which were damaged during the initial embalming procedures. The lab had to deal with mold and wrinkles on certain parts of Lenin's body, especially in the early years. Researchers developed artificial skin patches when a piece of skin on Lenin's foot went missing in 1945. They resculpted Lenin's nose, face and other parts of the body to restore them to their original feel and appearance. A moldable material made of paraffin, glycerin and carotene has replaced much of the skin fat to maintain the original landscape of the skin. </TEXT>

U.S. gold medal swimmer Ryan Lochte was robbed in a taxi hold-up in Rio de Janeiro after leaving a party where he had been celebrating the end of the Olympic swimming program, he told fellow competitor Thiago Pereira.

A spokesman for Brazilian Pereira told Reuters on Sunday Pereira had called Lochte after hearing reports the U.S. swimmer had been the victim of a gun-point robbery the night before.

"Thiago and his wife went yesterday night to a birthday party for a common friend with Lochte in the France House," the spokesman said.

"He parted ways with Lochte when he returned to his hotel with his wife.

"Today in the morning he received the news about Lochtes incident, so he called him and Lochte told him he was fine and said the taxi he was in got robbed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The plant works by moving large volumes of air through a piece of equipment where CO2 is absorbed by a liquid solution, and then transformed into pellets of calcium carbonate. The pellets are then heated to 800 or 900 degrees Celsius and break down, releasing pure carbon.

"There's no real magic to it," Corless said. "The pieces of equipment already exist today in very large scale. And we've really adapted them from other industries."

It may not be magic, but it is innovative  Carbon Engineering is a world leader in direct-air carbon capture, Corless said.

Soon the company will take the technology even farther, building another system that will turn the captured carbon into useable transportation fuel by adding hydrogen from renewable sources, such as solar, wind or hydro. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Much of Uday's notoriety abroad stemmed from his position as head of the National Iraqi Olympic Committee, which was accused of torturing and jailing athletes.

The London-based human rights group Indict said the committee once made a group of track athletes crawl on newly poured asphalt while they were beaten and threw some of them off a bridge. Indict also said Uday ran a special prison for athletes who offended him. The International Olympic Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland, said earlier this year that it was investigating the allegations.

One defector told Indict that jailed soccer players were forced to kick a concrete ball after failing to reach the 1994 World Cup finals. Another defector said athletes were dragged through a gravel pit and then dunked in a sewage tank so infection would set in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashi-Dorzho_Itigilov):

Itigilov left a testament asking to be buried as he was at the time of his death, sitting in lotus posture. According to his wishes, his body was put into a pine box and interred at a bumkhan (a graveyard for the lama burials) in the locality of Khukhe-Zurkhen (Dark-blue Heart in Buryat language). One of the testament clauses stipulated that his body should be exhumed by other monks within several years.

In 1955 and in 1973, Itigilov's body was examined by Buddhist monks, who were astonished to observe no signs of decay. They were too reluctant to divulge their finding to the anti-religious authorities of the Soviet Union and the body remained in situ until 2002.

On September 11, 2002, Itigilov's body was eventually exhumed in the presence of the leaders of the Buddhist Traditional Sangha of Russia. The body was transferred to Ivolginsky datsan (a residence of todays Hambo Lama) where it was closely examined by monks as well as by scientists and pathologists. The official statement was issued about the body  it was "in the condition of someone who had died 36 hours ago", very well preserved, without any signs of decay, with whole muscles and inner tissue, soft joints and skin.

A report by Al Jazeera states that the body had been preserved by being packed in salt and shows recent footage of the body being removed from this salt, although the reporter was not clear about when the salt was first applied.

The Buddhist monks approach him as a living person and shake hands with him. Some devotees even claim that Itigilov is still alive, only immersed in a hibernation- or nirvana-like state.

On April twenty-third, 2003, the Buddhist conference recognized the body of Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov as one of the sacred Buddhist objects of Russia. At that time, they laid the foundation stone for a temple entitled Itigel Khambyn ordon and consecrated to Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov. As of 2005, Itigilov's body was kept out of doors, in contact with other people, without preserving any temperature or humidity regimens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For Harriet Jacobs, escaping slavery meant hiding for several years in a prison of her own devising. Born a slave in North Carolina, Jacobs spent her teenage years living in fear of a cruel master who refused to let her marry and made repeated and increasingly brutal sexual advances toward her. When the harassment continued even after Jacobs had two children by another man, she resolved to make a break for freedom. In 1835, she fled her plantation and briefly hid in some friends houses. Knowing her chances of making it to the North were slim, she eventually holed up in a small attic crawlspace in her grandmothers home. The rat-infested room was tinyonly nine feet long and seven feet wide, with a sloping ceiling that never reached higher than three feetand Jacobs later wrote that it offered no admission for either light or air. Nevertheless, she would spend an astonishing seven years living in the coffin-like space, watching her children play in the yard through a small peephole and only leaving for brief periods of nighttime exercise.

Jacobs finally made her escape to the North in 1842, after a friend helped her secure passage on a boat bound for Philadelphia. From there, she proceeded by train to New York and reunited with family members. She spent the next few years working in New York and Boston, but remained wary of being captured by her former master until friends helped arrange her purchase and manumission. Jacobs later became an influential abolitionist and published a searing account of her ordeal called Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hammurabis Code took a brutal approach to justice, but the severity of criminal penalties often depended on the identity of both the lawbreaker and the victim. While one law commanded, If a man knock out the teeth of his equal, his teeth shall be knocked out, committing the same crime against a member of a lower class was punished with only a fine. Other rank-based penalties were even more significant. If a man killed a pregnant maid-servant, he was punished with a monetary fine, but if he killed a free-born pregnant woman, his own daughter would be killed as retribution. The Code also listed different punishments for men and women with regard to marital infidelity. Men were allowed to have extramarital relationships with maid-servants and slaves, but philandering women were to be bound and tossed into the Euphrates along with their lovers. </TEXT>

This then darkens and matures to give blue, purple, orange and then maroon tones. The previous seasons bark peels off in strips to reveal a brightly colored new bark below. The peeling process results in vertical streaks of red, orange, green, blue and gray.

<TEXT> From last month:

A Dutch foundation developing technology to remove waste plastics from the worlds oceans has launched a working North Sea prototype.

The organisation said that the prototype is the first ocean cleanup system ever tested at sea.

Two of The Ocean Cleanups main partners, the Dutch government, and dredging and marine contractor Royal Boskalis Westminster N.V., were represented at the unveiling.

The prototype has been installed in the North Sea, 23 km (12 NM) off the Dutch coast, where it will remain for one year. The objective is to test how The Ocean Cleanups floating barrier fares in extreme weather at sea  the kind of conditions the system will eventually face when deployed in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

The 100m long barrier segment deployed in the North Sea will help validate the survivability of the system.

My life has been full of dangers in which I should have lost a lot of bloodbut since I have bled only a little, I asked somebody to write Gods words with my blood in gratitude, President Saddam Hussein said in a letter published by the Iraqi official media in 2000.

Since the fall of Baghdad, most of the statues and other public displays erected by the fallen dictator have been dismantled and removed, but as it is also haraam to throw out or destroy copies of the Quran, the Iraqi government is uncertain how to proceed with this very strange and very powerful book.  It is so touchy a situation that to be allowed to view the Bloody Quran requires approval from a committee, and the three keys that open the vault are secretly hidden throughout Iraq.

The exquisitely crafted book will remain under lock and key until the government committee on historical artifacts and the dubious legacy of Saddam Hussein decides how to proceed with this unique work of religious art. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Around 700 years ago, German monks in the town of Einbeck developed a specific style of malty, dark, high alcohol beer to help sustain them during intense periods of fasting. This beer became known as Bock, a corruption of the name Einbeck. Later, discontent with the strength of Bock style beer, monks developed an even stronger variant known as Doppelbock, meaning double Bock. This beer was so laden with nutrition that some dubbed it liquid bread.

Now, these beers were so delicious that the monks began to wonder if they were contrary to the spirit of Lenten penance. Being faithful sons of the Church, they decided to consult the pope. On the journey to Rome, however, the beer was subjected to extreme weather conditions, causing it to spoil and turn sour. When the pope tasted it, he was so appalled by the spoiled beer that he immediately deemed it an excellent Lenten penance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Lest ye think Nixon wasn't an equal opportunity offender...**

From a May 13, 1971, conversation among President Richard Nixon, John D. Ehrlichman, and H. R. Haldeman. On October 5, 1999, the National Archives made available to the public 445 hours of previously unreleased Oval Office tapes. The following dialogue was transcribed by Chicago Tribune reporter James Warren.

RICHARD NIXON: We're going to [put] more of these little Negro bastards on the welfare rolls at $2,400 a family--let people like Pat Moynihan and [special consultant] Leonard Garment and others believe in all that crap. But I don't believe in it. Work, work--throw 'em off the rolls. That's the key.

JOHN D. EHRLICHMAN: The key is Reagan's neutrality. If Reagan blasts this thing and says it's not strong enough on the work-requirement end, that will be very bad.

NIXON: I have the greatest affection for them [blacks], but I know they're not going to make it for 500 years. They aren't. You know it, too. The Mexicans are a different cup of tea. They have a heritage. At the present time they steal, they're dishonest, but they do have some concept of family life. They don't live like a bunch of dogs, which the Negroes do live like.

EHRLICHMAN: The Mexican American is not as good as the Mexican. You go down to Mexico--they're clean, they're honest, they're moral.

NIXON: Mexico is a much more moral country.

EHRLICHMAN: Monterrey, Cuernavaca. Go into slum areas, and by God they come out with clean shirts on a Sunday morning.

NIXON: The church. You find a helluva lot less marijuana use in Mexico than the United States.

EHRLICHMAN: The unions are actually a stronger force down there than the church.

NIXON: For what?

EHRLICHMAN: For conduct and social policy.

NIXON: ... CBS ... glorifying homosexuality.

EHRLICHMAN: A panel show?

H. R. HALDEMAN: No, it's a regular show. It's on every week. It's usually just done in the guy's home. It's usually just that guy, who's a hard hat.

NIXON: That's right; he's a hard hat.

EHRLICHMAN: He always looks like a slob.

NIXON: Looks like Jackie Gleason.

HALDEMAN: He has this hippie son-in-law, and usually the general trend is to downgrade him and upgrade the son-in-law--make the square hard hat out to be bad. But a few weeks ago, they had one in which the guy, the son-in-law, wrote a letter to you, President Nixon, to raise hell about something. And the guy said, "You will not write that letter from my home!" Then said, "I'm going to write President Nixon," took off all those sloppy clothes, shaved, and went to his desk and got ready to write his letter to President Nixon. And apparently it was a good episode.

EHRLICHMAN: What's it called?

NIXON: "Archie's Guys." Archie is sitting here with his hippie son-in-law, married to the screwball daughter. The son-in-law apparently goes both ways. This guy. He's obviously queer--wears an ascot--but not offensively so. Very clever. Uses nice language. Shows pictures of his parents. And so Arch goes down to the bar. Sees his best friend, who used to play professional football. Virile, strong, this and that. Then the fairy comes into the bar.

I don't mind the homosexuality. I understand it. Nevertheless, goddamn, I don't think you glorify it on public television, homosexuality, even more than you glorify whores. We all know we have weaknesses. But, goddammit, what do you think that does to kids? You know what happened to the Greeks! Homosexuality destroyed them. Sure, Aristotle was a homo. We all know that. So was Socrates.

EHRLICHMAN: But he never had the influence television had.

NIXON: You know what happened to the Romans? The last six Roman emperors were fags. Neither in a public way. You know what happened to the popes? They were layin' the nuns; that's been goin' on for years, centuries. But the Catholic Church went to hell three or four centuries ago. It was homosexual, and it had to be cleaned out. That's what's happened to Britain. It happened earlier to France.

Let's look at the strong societies. The Russians. Goddamn, they root 'em out. They don't let 'em around at all. I don't know what they do with them. Look at this country. You think the Russians allow dope? Homosexuality, dope, immorality, are the enemies of strong societies. That's why the Communists and left-wingers are clinging to one another. They're trying to destroy us. I know Moynihan will disagree with this, [Attorney General John] Mitchell will, and Garment will. But, goddamn, we have to stand up to this.

EHRLICHMAN: It's fatal liberality.

NIXON: Huh?

EHRLICHMAN: It's fatal liberality. And with its use on television, it has such leverage.

NIXON: You know what's happened [in northern California]?

EHRLICHMAN: San Francisco has just gone clear over.

NIXON: But it's not just the ratty part of town. The upper class in San Francisco is that way. The Bohemian Grove, which I attend from time to time--it is the most faggy goddamned thing you could ever imagine, with that San Francisco crowd. I can't shake hands with anybody from San Francisco.

Decorators. They got to do something. But we don't have to glorify it. You know one of the reasons fashions have made women look so terrible is because the goddamned designers hate women. Designers taking it out on the women. Now they're trying to get some more sexy things coming on again.

EHRLICHMAN: Hot pants.

NIXON: Jesus Christ. </TEXT>

If the flesh disturbs you, then the reality behind the issue would disturb you far more if we opened our eyes long enough to see it. We live in a culture disconnected from what it is doing to itself and others, we choose to ignore rather than deal with the reality we have created for ourselves. This piece ultimately comments on this simple idea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mona Lisa has no clearly visible eyebrows or eyelashes. Some researchers claim that it was common at this time for genteel women to pluck these hairs, as they were considered unsightly.

In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and with visible eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps as a result of overcleaning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After Buddha was cremated, his left canine tooth was found in the ashes by his disciple Khema, who gave it to King Brahmadatte so that it may be venerated. Legends began to circulate, the most prominent of which was that whoever possessed it had the divine right to rule Brahmadattes kingdom. Many wars were fought for no other reason than to own it. The tooth was said to be responsible for converting many Indian Kings to Buddhism, performing miracles each time it was threatened with destruction. It is now placed within several golden caskets and displayed only for special ceremonies.

<TEXT> This greeting dates back at least as far as Ancient Greece. In the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, a funeral stone from the 5th century BC depicts two soldiers shaking hands. The base of a column at the Acropolis Museum in Athens, meanwhile, shows Hera [the wife and sister of Zeus in the Olympian pantheon of Greek mythology and religion] shaking hands with Athena [the goddess of wisdom, courage and inspiration in ancient Greek mythology and religion]. By shaking hands, rather than bowing or curtsying, both parties proved they were equals and that they felt sufficiently comfortable in each others presence not to bring weapons. </TEXT>

Already serving a one-year suspension for violating the NFL Policy and Program for Substances of Abuse, Smith appeared to deny that it was him in the video, tweeting, "Good try, not me." The NFL is investigating the video.

The incident was just the latest in a string of controversies involving Smith. The promising pass rusher was involved in an August 2015 arrest after which he was charged with hit and run, DUI and vandalism.

<TEXT> Bulgarian rakia is similar to Albanian raki and equivalent in many Balkan nations w/similar names.  They are strong spirits most often made of plums or grapes but without any additional essence added.  Drunk straight and room temperature.  The name is originally from Turkish and spread via Ottoman occupation of the Balkan peninsula.

Turkish raki is strong spirits as well but is distilled with anise for a very distinct flavor similar to Greek ouzo.  It is served mixed 1/2 raki 1/2 water with ice.  But be advised.  It will fuck you up before you realize what happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Erdogan haters are mostly mis-informed. The source of their hate stems from anti-Erdogan/imperialist propaganda that has been pumped out since the ~2011 conflict in Syria. Before then, he was a Western heart-throb, and anonymous to the Western plebes. Now he is demonized, perhaps not because he stopped taking orders from NATO/the West, but because the Gulenists were seen as a far more effective project to bring Turkey to its knees.

I am not defending Erdogan, but FETO is 100 times worse.

Those are the only two choices?  I have a lot of family in Turkey who would disagree with that, and know many more non-religious Turks who resent being forced to live in a society that is becoming more and more conservative all the time.  They are free thinking, tolerant folks who appreciate the diversity of the nation they live in.  They are in no way being brainwashed by imperialist propaganda, but they also want to be able to smoke a cigarette on the street during Ramadan without being punched in the face.

By the way, is this imperialist propaganda? -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFoIvcHdHI0 </TEXT>

Not saying I feel that way (as a former teacher in Turkey), but that's the justification.  Goal is to ensure that education, judiciary, military, etc all belong to people who will say yes to Erdogan at every point. </TEXT>
