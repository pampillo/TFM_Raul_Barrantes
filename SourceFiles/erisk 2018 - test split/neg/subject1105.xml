<TITLE> Coconut Panna Cotta </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-09 17:32:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Panna cotta is one of the easiest desserts to make out there, and I just so happened to have some leftover coconut milk so I decided to make some.

**Ingredients:**

25 g powdered gelatin

226 g full cream milk

340 g heavy whipping cream


396 g coconut milk

297 g condensed milk

**Procedure:**

Mix together full cream milk, whipping cream, and coconut milk in a saucepan. Sprinkle the gelatin powder over the mixture (bloom the gelatin) and set it aside for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, heat the saucepan over low heat and constantly stir the mixture until it comes to a boil. Once it boils, take it out of the heat and whisk in the condensed milk until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a container (I used several ramekins), let it cool and then refrigerate until the panna cotta is set. Serve chilled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed! I could use a human shield Lee *hint hint Scopely* Fingers crossed we get the most out of the Telltale token crates!

We have a lot of newer members this time around and it sucks because they don't listen to directives. They're more concerned with scoring points and getting mvp than taking towers and totally ignore us when we call them out and send them private messages. One long-time member even went rogue and started repairing when we clearly said no repairs then ignored us completely lmao. It's been painful, really.

How do you have enough space for all the members? Our leader turned down another merge with a new faction composed of 10 members all in the top 100. He refuses to let go of people and just take 20 to satisfy the merge. Loyalty is a big thing in my faction but sometimes I wish we were stricter. We've been far too lax with our members. I totally would have gone with the merge. Sadly I'm not as happy as I was before when I first joined. When I started out I was low-leveled and super active and seeing all the higher ups made me try harder. Now it seems I'm the one who tries the hardest and is the most active it sucks. I've considered switching factions but it's all just too much of a hassle :/

P.S. Best of luck in war! I hope you kick your opponents' butts!! </TEXT>

Or I could use 4* Clem too? I also got a 4* Molly so I have enough for a full fast time. I wanna integrate my 5* blue Lori and red Abe though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah well then congrats on getting that Joshua! We're so far off from getting to the top 3 given how many pay to win factions there are. It's ridiculous. My factionmates get all the luck; some do 10 pulls and actually get 5*s. Another did a single and got 5* Sophia. It's never me. :( I've gotten to 60k supply points now though so when Andrea pops up in the depot I'll have her. Keeping my fingers crossed it's an extreme sale though.

By the way I asked support if we could switch servers and was told we couldn't. The only way was to start a new game on that server. Lol

I didn't know we could ask for transfers! Do they move all your characters? I'm kinda iffy because with Scopely you never know what you lose and you may never have them back again. lol

I'm 950 down right now so I'm ahead of you by a 100. :P I'd race you there if we were getting the same amount of crates lol </TEXT>

First place gets yet another new toon, second gets fast Sophia and third gets blue Mark. I hope you guys do extremely well this war and win another 5*!

I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I magically end up in your region. Haha. Our region seems to be taking in new players a lot though so I don't think it'll be ours you will merge with. :(

They're giving out crates containing tokens as part of the prizes but it's nowhere near 10k! It's a mix of 5* (400 highest) and 4* toon (300), and 4* weapon tokens (300). It's going to take a looooong time to get that 5* off the tokens. </TEXT>

How'd you know Scopely is merging your region? I bet it wouldn't hurt to get some more friendly competition unless the other region has even more whales than your current one!

Aww the people in your faction are the best! Now I wish you guys were merging with our region so I could sign up for a spot for a 5*... lmao Where are your other members going though?

I wonder who the prize for the upcoming war will be. Probably another new character with an Execute skill. :( A full team revive would just be too much, though if I had one I wouldn't complain. haha </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh wow that's great! Our top scoring faction had 107k points and the second one had 93k. Top faction NEVER loses anything to anyone lmao. They've stayed on top for the 2-3 months I've been playing. 

And aw that is awesome of you to do! I wish top factions in our region would do the same, but I don't think they have room for weaker players, which sucks. Plus I don't think the members would want to give up their spot for someone else. I'm already convinced that I'll never win a 5* from a tourney unless they increase the range of the prizes, which is super unlikely. But oh well, I still find fun in the game and that's what matters. 

And yes, he is! I am so jelly of my factionmate but I am glad to have him around. Our leader decided to take in newbies (level 14   15) who were the only ones scoring for their former factions and who had an Omid and the OP Hershel, said we'd help them get the gear they needed to make their toons stronger. Great guy, our leader. He took me in too when I was a newbie and I am forever thankful.

Yeah I'm not a fan of the longer AR charges either. I've decided to only pull using my coins from the 30-day pass when there's a toon I really like with 44/45 rush. 

You never know what Scopely will come up with. Haha. Before Hershel I thought the catsuit Mirabelle was too OP with her stun, but then they released OP Hershel. But anyone more powerful than Hershel would be too much of an overkill. I hope they don't take that direction. </TEXT>

More than faction level up, I'm super stoked for war! I barely get any sleep when it's live but I don't care haha. Also we got 3 new members today! We're finally 30! One of them has the super OP Hershel and I got to use him as faction ally and I am sooooo jealous!!

<TEXT> Yeah plus his outfit at t4 sort of goes in theme with my blue Lori lol. I've always wanted hurt and heal characters too but have had no luck in getting them. :(

I'm saving my supply depot points for a 5*. Red Rick is on extreme sale right now and I'm thinking about buying, though I've always wanted a Morgan/Tyreese/Andrea from the depot. Have you bought a 5* from the depot?

Thanks for all the tips by the way! Learning a lot from you. Haha </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I'd rather win them from tourneys and wars! I tried two sets of ten pulls earlier in hopes of getting that super OP Hershel but I got the 5* red Abe instead. He any good? I've been hoping for 44/45ARs but a 5* is a 5*. Haha.

It sucks when Command isn't used properly by the AI. I've seen him use Command on a character that doesn't have his rush fully charged so that was a pity lol. Maybe I can keep Olivia first for my defense team instead of Chad and then eventually replace her with red Abe once he's leveled? Does an all-attacker defense team (the irony, I know) work? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ooohhh you got a good range of 5*s! I've always wanted Angela and Caroline but I only have blue Lori from a 10 pull from Mother's Day. She's the only 5* I have so I love her to bits. I've done a bunch of other pulls but haven't been lucky enough for any other 5*. My defense team consists of 4* Andrea, Jesus, Abe, Olivia (for attack I switch her up with 4* Lori) and then the blue 5* Lori. I tried going for Alicia in a solo level up tourney before but I only placed 21st. lol. I'm working on my Chad too and thinking about adding him and taking out red Lori/Olivia, because I've seen a lot of people using him (plus he is sorta cute lmao), but I'm a bit iffy about the loss of a turn on a character after Command's been used. What do you think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I scored my personal best in this war. Sorry to hear about the other factions taking control of the leaderboard. There were two factions in our region who put together top player in less than a week and climbed the leaderboards. As if we needed more factions with players who spend a lot on the game.

I'm glad to know about the messaging app you're making amongst yourselves. I hope it works out for the best!

Also, just out of curiosity, who are the characters on your main team? :P </TEXT>

I'm sure you'll be able to keep your faction thriving. You've come a long way after all!
No progress on the merge and it looks like we won't be pushing through with it anymore. We ranked 11th which is our best so far, considering the factions ranked above us were big spenders/whales, and we're like rank 25 in terms of combined faction rep. I gotta say this was our best run so far despite there being 5 people who scored 0 points. One of the top factions even messaged our leader and said that we were doing a good job on the leaderboard and that upper factions have noticed the effort. That was really good to know. I also got promoted to co-lead! So it's really been eventful! How did your faction do? </TEXT>

I don't exactly know how to describe a region. lol. I'm not always on global chat but when I am I see the same people again and again. There are random people with nothing to do from time to time. Just yesterday someone cursed at me out of nowhere for talking to someone else. lol He was a new player, so yeah there are those. There's the occasional drama too: factions disbanding, members getting kicked out, arguments on global, you name it. How is it in Crawford?

<TEXT> Way back faction lock during tourneys was put in place we weren't able to switch members around because the alliance was pretty new then. Now that it's been a while, we can't do much with it. Pretty ironic. Haha. It's all up to the leaders now I guess. Whatever happens I know my faction leader will choose what's best.

And darn, I was kinda hoping for a bit there that I was in the same region. lol. I play in Hart region. I think we still get some new players every now and then but the top factions are already too strong and heavy it's like they're competing amongst themselves. Haha. As always, thanks again! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! I enjoyed reading everything so thank you again for taking the time to share these things! I know a lot of members won't be happy if they get cut off and that's the main concern of our leader as well. We have a lower rank in terms of rep than our ally faction, but seem to be more active and organized and score better in events than them. Initially it was going to be a 20(from us)-10(from them) division but I guess after the two leaders considered how other members would react, they decided against it. I personally would like to see a merge though, because we could definitely use their strong players but then it's not my call. I'm way too invested in the game for my own good. Lol.

What region do you play in? Again, very much appreciate your help! </TEXT>

Not all of us are a part of it yet but a good majority of the most active members are.

2. I love salted caramel. Somewhere in my menu I'll definitely include salted caramel!
3. I actually found a recipe for a ricotta lemon souffle just now while looking around. Looks pretty good!
4. Haven't really thought about adding herbs and spices, but fruit seems like a good way to balance flavors.

where I use a polycarbonate mold and fill the center with a certain flavor. #5 is something like a croissant or a danish, where the pastry is flaky. One of my options is actually a creme brulee but I feel like it'll be too simple and was hoping to add something more to it if I do decide to go with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No it's not because you're the highest level person in your faction. The highest leveled member in ours gets the highest scores all the time. I think it's because of the refills he gets (he gets an awful lot compared to me, who rarely gets them), but I'm not sure if that's all there is to it. Sometimes the opposing faction gets to an unbelievably high score that we think they're coining it, but we're not totally sure.

Oh, and when you use enough refills and win your battles all the time, you get these bonuses for your winning streak, so those are score boosters too.

Someone who scores very high should let us know! :P </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi! I've been playing the RTS for about less than a month and am super addicted, but I still haven't fully grasped team building for different purposes. I don't have any 5 stars so I could really use the best team composition I have. Here are the good 3/4* toons I have:

4* fast Siddiq

4* fast Jesus

2 x 4* tough Shane

4* Olivia

4* alert Maggie

4* fast Abraham

4* Denise

4* Hershel

4* Amy

4* strong Heath

4* Lori


3* Dr. Stevens

3* Holly

3* Axel

3* "Miles Behind Us" Rick

3* "Made to Suffer" Rick

3* strong Eugene

3* Sandy

They're not all maxed out yet, but assuming they are, who should make up my raid attack/raid defense/zombie/human teams and their corresponding leaders?

Thanks for taking the time to read this! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently just got back into watching kdramas and really like Descendants of the Sun and Cheese in the Trap. I like rom-com shows that are light but captivating with characters you get attached to, or those with a very strong plot going on. Also it helps if the guys are cute too (lol). Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I'm looking for a compact camera and there are far too many options in the market that I can't decide (also, I don't really know what to look for). Currently, I just take photos with my iPhone and I know the quality is decent, but I'd like an even better one. I don't plan on venturing deeper into photography, and all I'm after is the quality of photos and the convenience (nothing too bulky/heavy). My budget would be around $500 to $600. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>
