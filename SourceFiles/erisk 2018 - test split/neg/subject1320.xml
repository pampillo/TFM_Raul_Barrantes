<TEXT> 
I will always remember the events of this day.  It was the weekend Captain America the Winter Soldier came out. April 2014.

A month before this movie premier, wanted to enjoy her spring break, she was a school teacher - 8th and 9th grade level.  She was aware of some of the problems we having prior to arriving.  I had kept her in the know about some of the events me and my girlfriend were experiencing.  One Bible having gone missing for over a year returned one night on fire.  Loud bangs, loud thuds, phantom footsteps, and yes a even a flying Amoire.   It was for those reasons she bought a cross with her when she arrived. A gift. Something she wanted us to hang on the bedroom wall.  To protect us. Written on the cross were Bible, Joshua 1:9, Phil 4:13, Psalm 28:7 and Matthew 19:26; each verse spoke about maintaining one's strength, one's faith during troubling times.

The cross was prayed over and immediately hung in our bedroom. The bedroom at that time was the third most active place of the house; it's also the place where we sleep.  So, a cross positioned high upon the wall seemed a great idea.  This was March.  Mid March I believe.  April arrives.

A week or so before the Captain America movie came out, the cross went missing. Missing objects in our home are not new and not a big deal. Things get taken all the time. Sometimes they return; sometimes they don't. The items that do return are never found in their original spot. This cross would be no exception.
I woke up one morning, my girlfriend was beside me - I looked at the wall the cross was on and saw that it was gone.  I told my girlfriend almost immediately.

Other religious objects have been taken already, some broken, some turned to sit upside down, some relocated and some just outright stolen.   Whether one cross goes missing or twenty crosses go missing our reaction was always the same.  What the heck is going on? 

The cross is gone. It's missing. My girlfriend and I had already given up on the notion of even looking for it. After all, it was a gift from my cousin, a spiritual gift at that.  No use looking for it, no one else lived with us, and objects get taken all the time. Whatever object we set out to look for, we never find.  This cross would be no exception.  My girlfriend and I talked about the cross being gone. I emailed my cousin the next day to tell her, she was shock.  The weekend arrives.

It's Saturday morning (movie day), and the cross is still missing. Like most Saturdays in my house, it was laundry day. I started doing my laundry early that day so I could go meet one of my friends for drinks.    Drinks and movie. That was the plan.

I began my first load of laundry: colored clothing. My girlfriend, Tina, is walking around the house doing her own thing. While my clothes are washing, I decide to go into my office and watch TV.  About an hour later, I noticed something peculiar. My first load of clothing was still washing. Now I know there are long wash cycles but this was weird - my brain knows how long it takes for my clothes to wash. So I'm in my office and I glance toward the wash room, hoping to hear the beep beep beep, the noise the washing machine makes when it's done. Clothes don't wash for an hour, especially my clothes, and especially a light load of clothing. So I glance at the wash room and sort of look at the clock on my PC toolbar , I think to myself what's taking my clothes so long to wash.

A few minutes later I hear this knocking sound: a banging and knocking. You know, the sound the washing machine or dryer makes when you're washing your shoes.   I hear this noise, and it's clearly coming from the washing machine. So, once again, I glance up from my PC and turn to face the washing machine or wash room.

Now in my mind I'm thinking - that sound wasn't there before? All I put in the washing machine was clothing. Coins, chap stick, keys, etc. wouldn't make that noise. And even if it did, those sounds would have been heard almost immediately. At this point, the wash cycle had been running for  nearly over an hour. So why the loud noises now? Normally I would get up, walk to the washing machine and open it up to see what the commotion was about. Normally that's what I would have done.   It was very uncharacteristic of me to not stop what I was doing and investigate. Looking back and reliving the moment, it seems weird for me to not get up and investigate the noise, especially with the previous events having happened in this house. I acknowledged the noise, and length of time it was taking for that load to complete.  But nothing was motivating me to go see what was taking so long. 

Minutes later, the washing machine beeped informing me that the load was complete.  I got up and went to the washing machine to transfer my clothes to the dryer. As I was pulling out clothes and tossing them into the dryer.  I immediately grabbed hold of something solid. Not clothing. Not shoes. Not anything except a metallic-wooden cross. I didn't know what it was until I pulled it out of the washing machine.  There in my hand in two pieces is the cross my cousin gave me.

Now some might say, "Well maybe the cross was in there to begin with." Not so. As I mentioned prior, the  would have been heard early on, especially during the spin cycle. The knocking noises I heard began 15 minutes before the washing was complete. When my machine is done it beeps. And also the washing machine was empty when I filled it with my clothing. Some might say, "Maybe you accidentally put the cross in the machine when you loaded in the clothes." Nope. It was a colored clothing load (machine wash COLD/WARM). I sorted my clothing carefully meaning items went into the machine almost one at a time. A cross this size was not going to be grabbed by mistake.  I'm talking about an eight-to ten inch cross. 8 inches long. 3 1/2 inches wide.  This wasn't a necklace.

Someone might also think might girlfriend put the cross in the machine. My girlfriend was nowhere near the washing machine that day, and I never left my office. The washroom sits right outside my office. And she wouldn't stop my wash load regardless. I do my own laundry, and she does hers.

I had to get those particulars out of the way because I realize people gravitate to the obvious explanation. And that is understandable but allow me to paint the picture near perfect as possible because it even hasn't began to get weird yet. In my hand is the cross my cousin gave me. It was wet and broken. I then called my girlfriend to the room. When she arrived, we both examined the cross from top to bottom. It had been taken the week before, about 5 days prior to turning up in the washing machine. I ended up fixing that cross. I put it back in it's original spot.  It would go missing a few more  times. It never appeared in the washing machine again. 

A few weeks later 2 Bibles caught fire.  A month or so after the Bibles catching fire another Bible went missing.  It has never returned.

<TEXT> I did not know the candles being thrown was going to happen.  Cameras were setup in the past.  A majority of them went missing, got thrown themselves. Some are still missing. Others outright broken.  I pulled out my cell phone because a few minutes prior the lights in the hallway and bedroom were going off and on.  I got this footage by accident. I was trying to record the inexplicable light phenomena when all of a sudden the candles got thrown. Watch part II, III and part IV and you'll see me journey into the hallway and masterbedroom.  Thats where the EVP voices begin. A light goes off to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> well "I'm a Mirror" can be heard.  The EVP was found upon review and based on my knowledge some weeks/months after the fact I can't remember if I heard anything. My reaction suggests I did, by my turning in the direction of the camera.  It does seem odd my turning towards the camera coincides with the "Im a Mirror" caught on video tape.    Not to mention the voice recorders in the kitchen.


My gut instincts tell me I heard something. But unfortunately we'll never know, this video was viewed weeks later upon which I can't remember what I was thinking at the time that caused me to turn towards the camera.  Its weird though and no my health is just fine.  If you didn't hear what I think, then what did u hear? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Normally I would agree. But those perimeters you mentioned were already taken into consideration. You assume I'm holding the voice recorder in my hand. I'm not. I rarely hold a device in my hand for that very reason. I'm used 4 voice recorders, 3 sitting side by side. The 4th sat in the hallway.  The tascam and the Zoom H2 do a superb job with filtering out air and background noise, hence their studio quality.  You get what you pay for and I only buy the good stuff.  Quality of equipment helps with debunking what we got.

You hear me talking, no exhaling is taking place. I'm alone in the room and the question being asked only requires that the answer be yes or no, hence the "No" being heard.  I've done countless of these and the words "YES" or "No" is ever captured during moments where nothing is asked.  Seems too convenient that both a "YES" or "NO" would only appear during direct yes or no questions.  

The "no" is then compared to the countless other "no" compiled over a period of time by other teams and other individuals.  "We analyze the "No" and it registers the same on the decibel reader.  same pattern, same and different environments. The only common denominater is "me."


IMO, low quality EVPs should not be ignored or not shared just because there low quality.  We've been able to determine these spirits voices are  lower, decibel wise when less people are in the room.   

There seems to be a correlation between the quality of EVP and the quantity of individuals present.  Thats the analysis here.

It seems plausible that both people (and their equipment) play a role in the quality of the EVP. Might be the entity's are drawing energy from everyone's who's present.    Granted this is a low level EVP. But it low level because I'm the only home.

<TEXT> Countless audio and videos are still be reviewed from the result of two investigations (with my home) this past Jan/February. Both US and UK teams descended on the house at different times.  The video below is of footage I had while the US team was in the home. They spent 3 weeks, living there.

<TEXT> I'm in total agreement.  I'm just floored by it due to the fact of living and seeing this before my eyes for 4 years.  I've seen my desktop manipulated. My TV turned off and on, even turned off and on while unplugged.  What gets me though is the conversation. The deliberate conversation of " go lift one of these...."

<TITLE> EVP - Bothell WA Home </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-29 20:05:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> April 2016 Steve and Don returned to the US(Bothell) and with them bought Nick Kyle of the SSPR.

The audio below is a snippet / (shortened so attention could be paid to the whisper EVPs) verse's the other noise and conversations.

Prior to the men's investigation that day. I setup voice recorders in both master bedroom and bathroom which is in the master bedroom or connected to it I should say. 

A series of trip wire, motion detect devices, cams and laser wire gear were going off in the bedroom. The room was sealed to prevent single person entry.  Once devices were setup the room was sealed. I have a remote CCTV cam in both rooms was able to hear and detect if and when the alarms would go off. They did. Several times.

Don had a theory about setting identical cams and etc. in the bathroom.  Up until now the bathroom was never really truly monitored. 

The audio below is of Don, Steve and Nick setting up devices in the bathroom.  The equipment being introduced is equipment never used. The audio was shortened of course to call attention to the voices. NONE OF WHICH CAN BE HEARD WITH THE NAKED EAR AT THE TIME THEY OCCURRED.


I'm very pleased that Soundcloud has a built in sound enhancement because the voices are clear. Especially after the 1st trip wire goes off (that Don and Steve are testing) at 1:10 motion detect goes off(that's us).

https://soundcloud.com/user-423872078/evp-image-detector

at 1:30 the entities begin talking to where you understand what they are saying. The 1st word one of them says is "Ray".


Vocals (something to the effect of)

"Ray,  Image Detector" 

"Cable" 

"its the only way it can be powered like that" 

"Go and Lift One of These" 
Allow me to put into context what it is they are saying and why.

There trying to guess what this new device is.  One refers to the other one as "Ray"  Very significant.

The word "cable" is mentioned which suggest there talking about the power cord. Some of the UK's devices and mine are battery powered. These devices in particular are not. They require power from the wall outlet. Which is in fact what Don and Steve were doing at the time this was happening.




Then one of them says "its the only way it can be powered like that" Which is why IT called Steve and Dons device a "image Detector"  I don't know about you but I've never heard of an image detector, neither has Steve or Don and both men would never utter that word.  The devices in the room(what Steve and Don were setting up, where Motion Detectors.) 




This might be a case of us and them splitting hairs as to what the device truly is.  Either way the fact that they are talking about it speaks volumes to their level of curiosity and intelligence. But they are not omnipotent when it comes to intelligence.  They have limits.  There revealing to you and me right now the limit to their knowledge.




Then comes the kicker of their conversation which is 

"Go and Lift One of These"  the one doing most of the talking is telling Ray to "go lift one of these"

In short he's telling Ray to go steal one.  Which suggest they want one to study, to analyze and to take elsewhere.  Where?  Your guess is as good as mine.

When I began my effort in 20014. Summer of 2014 to try to capture these guys. To try to obtain evidence  on video , on audio. The devices I used. many of them went missing. I'd place one down in the hallway or etc., walk away from it.  Come back that camera or etc. is either gone, turned around, turned upside down, or in some cases smashed to bits.  Some cameras are still missing. Some hard drives are missing. Some voice recorders are missing.  We have been able to determine that activity be it voice or physical phenomenon spikes when new devices, new technology is introduced into the test environment.


The only thing surpassing their feats and tricks is the level of curiosity these spirits posses.

I dont know about you, but I find this highly fascinating.  It deserves debate. It deserves conversation.  It is unbelievable.

Introduction.
During the latter part of August 2015 SEP were directly contacted by the client (Mr. Keith Linder) regarding reported disturbances taking place at his home in Bothell, Seattle, Washington USA. He claimed that paranor-mal disturbances had been taking place with increasing frequency and severity since moving into the property with his partner (Tina) in 2012. Pre-assessment of reported disturbances: Severity 6 of 10, Frequency 6 of 10. The client responded to a number of SEP email communications in regards witnessed and recorded paranor-mal disturbances. Though SEP do collate pre-investigation documentation, we cannot confirm pre-investigation incidents to be credible. However due to evidence obtained during active investigation stage 1 and 2, we have no reason to doubt the client at this time. Pre-investigation disturbances noted below have been considered authentic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> GREAT QUESTION:  It took me several years to catch up with some of the previous tenants in my house.  When I caught up with one she mentioned to me the problems they had.  Some of what we experienced they experienced: loud bangs, waking up finding every cabinet door open. Being locked out of the home, foot steps, shadows, pacing back n forth. Missing objects and thats about it.  The one thing different from her story than mine was the events she mentioned started a year after moving in the home.  She then went into detail about her abusive relationship , domestic violence coinciding with (and this is VERY IMPORTANT). a son less than 6 yrs at the time developing meningitis, her son also suffers from autism,  he became very ill n the home( my 666 office) at the time she became unemployed, domestic violence spiked. Both the violence and ill-son led her into alcoholism, she became very sick, retreated into the bottle, and felt trapped. She mentioned she felt repressed.  I believe and I admit this is my theory, but it no worse than the other theories, and some are compelling. I find this the most compelling of all in the sense that the horrors she mentioned to me, the condition of her son, and then the serious meningitis.  It grew dark, very dark in the home and she felt trapped.  She was unemployed, sick son, alcoholism and domestic abuse and I mean the worse kind of domestic abuse.  All that and more point to incendiary condition's.   Most Poltergeist cases point to children mainly female as being the cause agent. 10% of Poltergeist cases point to incendiary conditions which can led to enough negative energy being created: The condition itself creates the Poltergeist. The Poltergeist becomes the force that acts out the agents feelings.  That energy then gets trapped in the home. Takes over the home and will stay in the home for a considerate amount of time.  To extend its life it feeds of new energy. New house occupants.  Similar  cases show this will eventually fade out, only if enough time elapses between house occupants.  Which I'm here to tell you has not happened.  And here's were I contradict myself so forgive me but try to think deep about what it is Im saying.  The fact that this house for a period of time became no negative, became so dark . The energy became so thick, so concussion like, probably attracted other negative entities.  When it comes to malevolent spirits, opposite dont attract, alike entities attract one another. A house so negative, so vile, so ugly, so dark will attract other dark spirits.  Its like rats and roaches. One comes, they all come.  When you get down to it, thats what I think is wrong with this house.  Homes where a violent death took place have equal similarities. Same with a home were a major injustice was done.  Which one was done here. Im just not at liberty to share that detail.    When I finally got hold of the previous tenant, she didn't know me from atom. I asked her to describe her experience in that house. And her words not mine was "that house was a living hell."  I didn't know her from atom and I agreed with her 100%

<TEXT> I can totally understand why someone would use the word "major claims". But lets be clear. Those are your words not mine.   One only has to study be it online, be in their local library, be it on Amazon the various books that document well the past cases of Poltergeist related activity. History is the best qualified to reward all research. In short look it up!  Compare my accounts with historic accounts.  Don't take it as gospel, or drink the Kool-aide as the saying goes.  But let your mind do the walking.  The similarities from continent to continent are profound.  Truth be told cases of burnt books, burnt bibles, wall markings, objects thrown have been recorded, reported and documented since 840 A.D.   More cases go unreported than are reported and rightfully so, look at the push back simply with this case.  No one wants to believe until they #1 see with their own eyes, which is basically what you're saying and #2 easy to label something a hoax just because they can't see it with their own eye's.    Instead of complaining what you cant see, which I would admit would be kick a$$ and cool.  But Poltergeist dont work like that. Instead drawn parallels to  alike events. Compare my testimony with the testimony of others, and by others I mean 800 A.D and beyond.  I admit I knew zilch about demons and Poltergeist before all of this happened. What I learned about demons I got from Sunday school. What I learned about Poltergeist I got from camp fires, and Hollywood movies. Which proves my point of un-learning what we think we know, we know zero.    It is very difficult to catch the "geist" in action.  Its almost like aiming a telescope up the random sky hoping to catch a Sun go Nova.  We know Suns do this, but we never know when its going to happen. We know lightening strikes. But who knows if and when one will happen let alone captured on film initiating mass destruction.  

The KPI's of my case are to a degree parallel to other cases.  There are elements of individualism. But for the most part there are similarities which has caused me to shun and laugh at those who say my claims are MAJOR. When compared to the 1000's of other cases, and yes there are 1000's of reported cases. These events are not major.  

We live in a really big world.  

Objects thrown
Spontaneous Fires
Wall Writings
Missing Objects
Items appearing
Rappings and more

are the tall tail signs of similar phenomena taking place.


Man has a lot of catch up if he's ever going to prove Ghosts are real.

Ghosts are real. Poltergeists are real but we're along way before there looked and accepted as being main stream.

There once was a time when man as a whole thought the world was flat and that was considered man stream.

Men use to think our world sat and existed on Turtles.

those relative terms and methods of thinking mean nothing to the grand scheme of things.

<TEXT> I dont expect you believe anything. Several components must happen in order for you to day. Two I have no control over. The one I do have control is me sharing what I'm sharing.  If the written reports of others, witness accounts , previous tenants testimony, and clergy involvement dont sway you. Nothing will.  That's not why I'm here. I'm sharing an experience. You can either take it or let it alone. I do however welcome questions.  Since I believe thats why we're all here. To answer each others questions.  Ask away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Para I noticed you always revert back to the idea that with all this activity I should be providing you with something impressive. Truth be told I have. You're just too into Hollywood to believe it.   What I've shared with you is beyond impressive if you look at it as  a whole.   The crux of the matter is anything I show you ( what you define as impressive ) can still be faked. Can still be created with just the basic off Ebay movie software.  YouTube is littered with fake videos, and they have substantial hits as a result of doing that. U know why?  Because those individuals are satisfying your appetite for Hollywood visuals.  And lastly, you dont read or listen to well.  I've never seen the entity in my home write on the wall. Most of the time I've been at work. Sometimes we've been one room away. I've never seen a Bible ignite itself. I have seen one Bible on fire, but not catch fire if u understand the term correctly.  I have seen objects thrown as when I say thrown I mean I've seen an object fly in mid-air.  I've never seen an object launch, except for the plant by the entertainment center. Most Poltergeist phenomena happen out of site of the house occupant.  The Poltergeist is not in the interests of showing the home occupant how it does what it does.  The Poltergeist excels at doing most   (99% )of its mechanization out of site of camera and out of site of house occupant.  There are many theories as to why they do this. None of which you seem to be familiar with.  Even with a majority of the actions being done off camera or away from the house occupant, common sense can still prevail. One simply just needs to know the law of cause and effect and the law of gravity.  Objects cannot go airborne without the aide of energy.  E=MC^2 states that energy times mass are synonymous.  One needs the other in order to execute. I dont have the all the answers, so dont point fingers at me. One thing I do have is common sense. Heavy objects can't lift themselves and go airborne without the aide of something else.  That something else in my home, just happens to be paranormal.   

[As soon as you can show me video of the hovering spray paint can marking on your walls, or objects mysteriously levitating vertically, then flying horizontally across a room, we'll talk. Again, since you have cameras throughout the location, I'm certain that these videos must exist, right?]   

Your question just proves my point as to how you suffer greatly from not knowing anything about the paranormal.    I think Yoda said it best when Yoda told Luke. You must unlearn what you have learned. Dam dude didn't u ever watch the Matrix?  STOP THINKING SOME INVISIBLE HAND IS HOLDING UP A SPRAY CAN AND PAINTING WALLS.  That's kindergarten thinking.   

I have seen carpets in my carpet lay flat as most carpets do, go from the flat position to the being 100% rolled up position in a blink of an eye.  And I dont mean figuratively. I mean literally.  I once walked to my mail box and bought my mail home. 1) sat my mail on my computer desk upstairs 2) Leave my office and by the time I was at the landing stairway 3) those letters on my desk are now sitting on the mid-landing area.  These feats and actions speak to a level of Physics, a level of quantum tunneling, quantum physics which by mathematical equation alone is known to exists. STOP WITH THIS ADOLESCENT THINKING  that Caspar the friendly ghost is running around the house with a spray can.   The writings on the wall most likely happened in a blink of an eye.  The next time the Scientific American does a story on Parallel Universes I expect you to buy a membership.  You have much to learn dude.  Much too learn. </TEXT>

LOL  https://subject1320.box.com/s/93o3vk8o5i52225lpb686rudo9ikwfg3   you can't tell another man or woman what they've seen is not true. You weren't there.  I wish u was but life doesn't work that way.  Are you adept to looking the devil in the eye and living to write about it?  What would your common sense tell you if you while watching TV saw a plant leave one table and fly across the room shattering into bits?  Would you deny your own eye's?  Your own common sense?  Would you say you had too much to drink that night?  Were you suffering from disillusion?  What would you do or say if you lived in a house where while sleeping your bed rose up off the ground?

Hmm let me see we've seen plants thrown, candles, thrown, a vase thrown, a cologne bottle thrown, a lamp thrown, an iron board thrown, a can of starch thrown. A chef knife thrown (that was scary).  Wall marking?  Multiple wall markings.  Multiple crosses drawn on the wall, the upside down man drawn on the wall, a 666 drawn, paw prints. "Die KL" drawn on the wall. Those are just for starters.  Lets talk about them. Pick your poison (subject)?  Give me what you got?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> if you see Video 2 I think you hear me point to my printer in my office.  The power appears to have been cut 3 to 4 times. The Foscam is does not do video feeds, I wish it did. It can only take snap shots of the images when motion is detected. I still have the original email and their attachments with the appropriate time stamps. One does themselves a disservice to scream shenanigans all the time.  Remember the Poltergeist, ghost, minion, spirit, demon or whatever wants you think that way.  It does things with an ounce of plausibility and an ounce of disbelief, as in this is all orchestrated and staged. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Summer 2014 House Attack - Foscam Email alerts. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-13 05:22:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Every now and then I comb through my video library aka video diary and see videos   pics I've uploaded that if combined tell a interesting story.  I had many Foscam cams setup in my house in 2014. Most were destroyed or just out right taken. 3 to 4 are still missing.  The Foscam has a motion alert, motion email notification. When the cam detects movement or sound it will send an email alert. A time stamp and snap shot comes with that email alert.  Video 1 shows the order of which events occurred that day in the kitchen.  Objects were moved around in the kitchen while no one was home.  These objects being moved are what I believe triggered the camera into action - of taking pictures and emailing me.  Follow and study how one chair disappears, only to return later in the office.

Video 2 was taken the same day.  I came home from work. I'm providing commentary about Video 1, which is the email, snap shot alert due to motion/sound detection.

<TEXT> You do know "could" is not evidence.  The burden of proving something is matrixing is just as equal as proven something is paranormal.  Just because you say its matrixing doesn't make it so. 

I never heard of asking a question and the return answer ended up being the correct answer to the question asked.

I guess "Find Me" is matrixing as well

and 

"Three"
https://youtu.be/IJdqk8xPKVE

I think I've figured you out now.  In your mind the paranormal doesn't exist. It unreal.  In your view everything has a logical explanation to it whether we know it or not. Everything has a logical rational which means it fall's or exist within the confines of logic and science, but it not ghosts, its not the dead talking, its not demons, and its not Aunt Betty.

i love debating your kind as equal as I love debating the devout paranormal believer.

This Day 4 Test 5. 1st time at 3:43: 42. "KEITH" EVP at 3:54:03.Conclusion: The Bear Test was done for 5 days. There were 4 successful activation's (alarm going off) during the course of that time. Day 2 nothing happened. Day 5 nothing happened.  The number of times the alarm went off diminishes with each day.  The theory behind that is they simply got bored.  There numerous EVP's in this video. many I left out. I will list them later. Feel free to add them below in the comments section.  The "Keith" EVP at 3:54:03 is very noticeable.   My name is Keith BTW.  More tests, thought experiments are being done. I share what I catch.  If anyone doubt these claims as being real. PM me. I can make both teddy bears accessible.  The links below shed more light about this case.  The bed shakes, poking and prodding still continue while I sleep.   https://youtu.be/_xt7GiGhlrs  and http://www.coasttocoastam.com/pages/parapsychologists-declare-home-has-poltergeist </TEXT>

<TEXT> that's your ill-response to everything?  Someone substantiates our claims, the claims of previous tenants, conjurs up, falsifies  evidence  for book or movie deal?  Tell me the name of someone in this field, a name, a team, an organization that you believe to be 100% legit?  What source material do you support and agree with?  Careful how you answer that question?  That individual might already be reviewing the evidence of this case.  They might already be on team "Keith" I'd hate to disappoint you with their involvement.

<TEXT>  If there's one thing I've learned since this began is the paranormal is vast.  Highly siloed and very closed in.  The left hand (of the paranormal community) doesn't talk to the right hand of the paranormal community.  The Zak Bagans of the community being of one those silos.

I talk to renowned individuals everyday.  Interesting enough the people I talk to, that talk to me don't view the paranormal community favorably.  So the feeling might be mutual.   But guess what the field in question doesn't belong to one group, one race of individuals.   Yu can't copy right the term paranormal.  I get contacted everyday by a lot of paranormal individuals.  I speak to other witnesses. Other researchers and other parapsychologists.  

Some (not all) not viewing me in a favorable way is more so a blessing. It tell's more about them than it does about me.

I'm just telling a story. A true story. Sharing evidence.  If that's the definition of being viewed unfavorably then history shows me to be in good company.

<TEXT> EZ.  the truth is a relative term.  The "Why" is an EVP albeit a difficult one to hear, especially if you don't know what to you're listening for.  Especially if the EVP in question doesn't meet your definition of an EVP to begin with.  If I was to ask 5 people in the paranormal field their definition of an EVP i'd get 10 different answers. Lastly not everyone can hear the same EVP, even though its there. Many miss it on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th try.  One thing is true and this might be where your getting stuck at. There are many classes of EVP.  Some in the field dont like to call an EVP an EVP unless its a Class A EVP. I beg to differ.  We've compiled enough evidence, to show the quality of EVP rises with the amount of people in the room.

EVP at 00:10. "WHY" then a quick "No" at 00:13 seconds. April 2016. Days before the movers arrived I placed voice recorder and trip wire in the hallway of my home.  I wanted to see what if anything the spirits would say as a result of me moving, taking down beds, pictures, and etc.  This is one snippet of that encounter. EVP at 00:10.

<TEXT> The GA team were divided into two teams A team (Zak and crew) and the B team (B roll) as it is called.   Suffice to say the B team was better.  My sentiment of Zak and crew is a matter of public record. But in the end it was a blessing in disguise.  Because there lack of thoroughness allowed me to contact other, more experienced teams(experienced in malevolent haunting) i.e. world renowned Steve Mera parapsychologist of the UK. and Chief researcher Don Philips. They came and busted the case wide open. Yielding powerful results.  Hence the "Im a Mirror" evp above and much much much much more.

<TEXT> If you have no interests in promoting your work then you are not advancing the science, knowledge and understanding of Parapsychology. If there's one thing I notice that sticks in my craw about both Paranormal and Parapsychology is how silloed you individuals are. And more sad and shocking is how much you take pride and relish in the fact that you are private, cut-off, wont share, won't dialogue with others with identical interests and understanding. 

A physicists at UT(Austin) will communicate and share his/her info i.e. publication with the physics community for both opinion, objectivity and possibly the new discovery and advancement of the field which is to ultimately seek the truth about life itself.  

Here you are on Reddit giving me beef, lecturing me on how you never heard of Steve Mera. I now know why you haven't heard of Steve Mera. You're too dam private.  This is either gross malpractice, or ego. Or both.

The perfect example from a professional point of view of how the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. Build a web site. Write an article and share it among colleagues.  Adopt a best practice method. In short come out of the cave and into the 21st century.

Ex.
[Einstein gave a series of lectures in 1915 about his new theory, which was to become known as the General Theory of Relativity, including a new equation to replace Newton's law of gravity, now known as Einstein's field equation. The complete theory was finally published in 1916, although physicists and mathematicians like Karl Schwarzschild and Ludwig Flamm were starting to publish solutions to his field equations even before its publication] </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have no clue why a ghost would "I'm a Mirror"  I think its a riddle. Might mean its a portal? A doorway? A reflection of us?  Thats a good question. One I was hoping to entertain here (which is why I bought the info to this community).  What does it mean when an entity says "I'm a Mirror?"  Thats a great question. I'm open to theories, intelligent theories, intelligent thought experiments. No mirror has ever been broken in the house.  Mirror in general are viewed as doorways so maybe its related to that.  Maybe it means you guys will never catch me because "I'm a Mirror"  I'm a reflection of you. Its quite unusual and I think it means something.  Im googling the term now to see what I come up with. Maybe there's some sort of historical reference.   </TEXT>

No thats how you're interpreting it. Im not getting evidence every single day. if you'd read you see the date says April 2016. Which coincides when S.E.P was last here. I moved out of the house in May. May 9th to be exact.

I'm sharing with you and you I mean this forum the evidence after its been reviewed, compiled and analyzed.

It takes days, weeks, months to review audio and video file.  You best your last sight saber the fact that you're seeing it hear means its been 100% vetted.

do yourself a favor and get caught up on all the facts!

<TEXT> You know whats super funny, super sad about this whole mini debate between you and I?  You're inability to admit when you're wrong. When Albert Einstein realized one of his equation(theories) was wrong he openly admitted to the world it was his greatest mistake. His biggest blunder, Even by admitting his greatest mistake via publication he gained greater prominence and respect from both skeptic and believing community.  He grew intellectually.

It takes a BIG man to admit when there wrong.  And what's even more sad is what does it cost you to admit being wrong  What prevents you from saying you know what I wasn't there, Zak and GA was.  They left with nothing, maybe something chose to not present itself while they were there.    Maybe what GA shows on TV is a little too simple. I mean any paranormal investigator worth his/her weight in gold will tell:  99% of investigations yield 0 results. .5% yield inconclusive. The remaining .5% are true mystery cases.  Let Ghost Adventures tell it  theyre batting a 1000. Every time. Several teams have come in, spent greater lengths in the home, other teams with far more experience, far more longevity in the field than GA. Teams before and after GA. S.E.P  uncovered a lot, at the very least they uncovered something. You saying something is not there, that its all a hoax is like a Dr trying to perform open heart surgery by peeping through a key hole.  Youre swallowing the opinion of man who buys his hair gel in bulks.  His verdict is supposed to be gospel?

Instead of attacking the messenger and proving you can be. #1 Zealot for Zak Bagans why not ask thought provoking questions?  Why not analyze whats been put forth. Obviously Im not afraid to be scrutinized: look whove Ive invited into my home? - look at what I've put forth?  And if that don't suit you then exercise your God given right to just ignore it. Ignore it and allows others with interests to chime in.  Thats a lot better than trying to be the Barney Fife on Redditt message boards.
I display my credentials openly. I've yet to hear from you and from other skeptics on what makes you the judge and jury on whats paranormal and whats not?

If you are the expert then take a page from Albert Einstein. Admit when you're wrong and just let it end with that.
If not. Be you. And I will continue to be me which means expect more info. More evidence. After all this is a paranormal community.  Not the world is flat community.

[Pretty sure the implication was that these two nuts were spray painting their walls with fake burn marks and attempting to drum up attention. Fortunately, the clients found a bunch of "researchers" who want attention as much as they do.]  Your conjecture and innuendo amuses me.

"...Well it proves one thing, Mr. Hooper. It proves that you wealthy college boys don't have the education enough to admit when you're wrong. "

<TEXT> No actually its called due diligence.  When you capture 500 GIGS of video and audio. It takes months to comb through.  Slowly but surely it gets done.  Then its checked, re-checked and double check.  Couldn't help you obvious ignoring of the evidence already provided.


Put a blind fold on. ignore the source. pretend it was you who found it and you'd be saying thing Im saying.

Don't shoot the messenger. Dissect the message.

They said they just didnt find any evidence "while they were there." And if there such a low caliber team (as you you say the laughing stock of) then how can you expect them to find true evidence to begin with. In all actuality its a blessing they didnt.

Nothing doesn't equate to fake or hoaxing.  Heck you might be even be on the GA payroll.  Instead of vouching for Zaks skills as an investigator why not ascertain some true research?  Why not broaden your horizon. if not. ignore a post you dont believe in.  Zaks fan club is a few message boards over. proceed to right please </TEXT>

<TEXT> dude you should really get off Zak B nut sak.  #1 GA never said it was a hoax or fake. They said they found no evidence.  Paranormal teams investigate establishments all the time and MOST of the time (not like how the portrays) they leave with nothing.  To label something or hoax you have to first catch them in the act.  You literally have to see someone hoaxing or planting evidence. I wish you would get that through your dense little head. Stop drinking Zak Bagans Kool-Aid!.  If your interest is really paranormal then you'd know and understand Ghost Adventures is a TV show. They dont even make up 1% of both the science and paranormal community.   The minute you wake up and understand that, trust a whole new world is going to open up for you.

GA investigated the house for 7-10 hrs
S.E.P investigated the house for 2 weeks. 360+ HRS

Do the math

<TEXT> One of the theories being talked about is some sort of portal door was opened. Why, How or by who we may never know.  Weve only been able to reach two of the previous tenants.  Parapsychologist Steve Mera theory is a Poltergeist infestation has in an indirect or direct way attracting other entities to the home.  There does appear to be a correlation in some cases, the rarest of cases of demonic and Poltergeist cases being either the same or similar. One begets the other.

Another theory is the spirits in the house are tied to the land.  We have EVPs were the vocal responses say they move from house to house. 

The vocals talking above, one of them is called Ray. We have this on about 5 other EVPs. Rays the subordinate. The one bossing him around so far remains unnamed

These two are who I feel could possibly be demonic or minion.

Its clear by the EVP there watching me. And this confirms I was followed. 

All is quiet right now except for the bed shakes, poke and prodding while sleeping and the feeling of being watched.

A lot of bed shakes, tugging, pulling, crawling over me while sleeping. Poking and prodding. Middle of the night I got up and placed a voice recorder in the hallway, outside my bedroom.  00:17 weird noise,  Whispers, Murmuring, voices, at 1:57,  "Ray?" 2:08   "Keith" at 2:12,  other whispers, murmurs, 2:19 "EVP"  3:53 "Keith",  6:03 another "Ray!"  Ray quickly responds at 6:04. 6:06 thru 6:08 conversation going.  6:06 accent voice "You Like?" accent voice sounds like "Chew like" weird dialect.  6:46 "EVP",  23:10 "SEE HOW HE STOOD UP,?"  EVP coincides with me getting out of the bed.  Murmur and whisper then "Fast" 23:31. [Is he implying I got out of bed fast?]   23:41 a response of "Yeah" 26:36 "How are you?  or Hello?"  I turn off recorder and leave the NEW house. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Normally that's true.............................however I think with these captures a little pointing goes a long way. Its not misleading to time stamp and tell someone where and when to listen in. Carefully. Especially a video that's an hour or so long. People want the meat and potatoes. And they want it quickly. I dont edit, or splice my videos for people to hear. I time stamp and tell you were the evp will appear. U still have the job and ordeal of actually hearing it.  Very few come back to me saying they cant hear.The evp is that precise.

Part Two of House Attack June 30th 2014. Motion detection, camera movements and furniture displacement into my upstairs office. Narrative is I come home from work late in the day(already knowing chair would be in my office from the email pics I got) Arrived to this. Revisiting the video ti would seem there are voices embedded within the video that are not mine. Ex. 4:02  "Aye" I say Im putting the cross back and something says "Aye"  EVP at 5:13 I say so it seems nothing is out of order a whisper can be heard of "NO" at 5:34 and  at 5:35 faint whisper "You're Wrong?" 5:48 "No" again 5:54 EVP Faint but present. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Evidence is in the eye of the beholder.  You NOT BELIEVING DOESN'T cause me to loose sleep at night.  Sorry to bust your bubble it really doesn't. Odds are you're not a believer of the paranormal.  Odds are you view yourself and both judge and jury on whats paranormal and what's not. Odds are you view everything with an extreme inordinate amount of skepticism. Odds are you comb such communities to prevent others from taking a serious look.   BUT the more you engage me in a back in forth the more others read this post and private email, agreeing with my cclaims based on their own experiences.  So by all means keep engaging with me.  I told you before my goal is to increase the dialogue on what malevolent entities are.  To increase the dialogue around the and talk about the science behind it. Trust me I know your kind. We moved in this house May 2012, and the evidence compiled, shared and still being analyzed is making reverberations through out both paranormal and parapsychology community. My claims. Better yet our claims were substantiated months ago. SO please do your home work and play catch up.  If the truth of the paranormal interests you then ask an intelligent question. Until then the only thing you're doing is blowing smoke and voicing an opinion and you know what they say about people with opinions?

<TEXT> Oh I know exactly what the word means and you are the poster child for it when it comes to paranormal sketism.

You ignore other key components i.e. facts. You ignore the men present and the organization they represent SSPR and SEP. You ignore the EVP'S that come with the video. You ignore or fail to make mention the 300+ other videos. 

You ignore due dilengence and you cling to while throwing the it around at the same time. That word being hoax. This case was settled back in January.  I'm just sharing snippets of that investigation.  One out many that discovered and brought to light the home in question is occupied by land locked phenomenon.

<TEXT> Once again you're throwing out innuendo and speculation. You imply or suggest hoaxing when you offer no evidence of the sort.  You know little merits of the case. About the case and therefore wish to deduce that there is hoaxing.  Hoaxing means nothing unless you can prove it. Its the skeptic and cynics EZ way out.  You dare not advance the discussion by asking pertinent questions which MAYBE, JUST MAYBE might give you the evidence you need to suggest hoaxing. But right now all you're doing is grasping at straws.  I deal with skeptics and cynics everyday. Have been for the past 4 years.  Your argument is always the same. I swear you all must come from the same cookie sheet. You can't prove hoaxing. You can only suggest it.  if you want the truth then ask intelligent questions and cease with the ass-umptions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi GhostCheese your analysis makes a lot of assumptions, many which lack evidence to support them. The men in the video are from both Scotland and the UK. Combined 60+ years in paranormal research. Neither of them would ever call themselves an expert in the field but I feel safe saying  their methods used to determine paranormal activity are indeed sound and prudent. Not on their own merits but on the merits of hundreds of other tests done within this house.  Granted your looking at one piece of the puzzle so you're fundamentally handicap and by handicap are therefore quick to throw out suspicion and baseless innuendo.  Its funny how you think one could be so crafty to invite men and organizations from half way across the world. Travel 10,000 miles and rig a house with gadgets and ghost detection gear, which includes a rotating camera that must be manually controlled when its rotating and BUT "ooops someone forgot to remove the fan." Not only that WE still include the fan in the video which took hours to edit and upload.  Thats a folly thought.   This house has been lived in for 4 years, investigated for 2 weeks by the men u see in the video and investigated by others for one year who are not in the video. All though they dont regard themselves as experts are (who is?) highly regarded and respected in the paranormal.  Just because an event can be hoaxed doesn't mean it was. You have to prove its a hoax and up until now you have not. Your suggestion that all of this is rigged and orchestrated has not been proven: merely suggested.  Its text book innuendo.   You'd be doing  yourself a favor by carefully researching the entire case vs. making baseless assumptions via peeping through a key hole which up to now is all you have done.  Why dont you try asking a question first?  This is not the only video where trip wires were activated, we have others. We have EVPs. We have statements of objects being moved minus the visible aide of someone: some of which these men have seen. And we got previous tenant testimony and thats just for starters.  Saying you work for or use to work for a InfrRed company therefore qualifies you as a subject matter expert on trip wire is ludicrous.  How can we verify that?  I could be the King of Spain for matter. And lastly two different trip wire models made by independent manufacturers going off in different rooms multiple times over a span of days and weeks is not coincidence.  Not when you add in the other factors.  You're best bet is too just ask questions vs. verbalize your innuendo or assumptions. I said in the video notes(read them) the alarms where set off purposely ( to draw us upstairs ). As was Steve camera dying almost immediately upon being set down.

Its ok to debunk stuff. But debunking minus deep thought, deep review of all the evidence makes your efforts futile.

<TEXT> Thank you Jamalyja.  You did me a who favor.  I like how you believe or try to suggest Ghost Adventures own the proprietary  on Ghost Investigations.  In all actuality you make my argument for me.  Where a TV show failed, other paranormal teams including some from Scotland, the UK, Maryland and Massachusetts and even Seattle succeeded and the evidence is bar none.  There's a fundamental mental difference of fan dome which u clearly are and those with a true interests in the paranormal.  8 team, each individual of each other cant be wrong. 

I'll just leave these here.

U can skip to when the word is uttered "duh" .  if I get in the habit of editing, and condensing material thats where evidence gets faked and fabricated.  U have the time stamp of when the word will appear. IMO the nothing before and after is equally important. IMO

Thanks

at least i got u to admit to a "word" being mentioned. Thats progress

<TEXT> Para-Skeptic

You're denying the most common sense of all which is this has been going on for four years. No team from either the east coast or the UK and Scotland is going to trek 10,000 miles for a hoax. Let alone come back again for a 2nd and 3rd time which some teams have done.

I dont know what you're relationship is to the paranormal field, and I dont care. But its obvious you dont trust or value the opinion and insight from the likes of other paranormal individuals who've came and gone from this house.  Steve Mera 30+ years paranormal and paraschological experience and background. SPS, the SSPR, Niki Unparanormal and countless others, Don Philips.

These people all independant of each other have already sustantiated my claims that this house is haunted. What perplex them now is why.

They've interviewed the previous tenants. Fr. Roy a priest has come and gone and assisted. Local news have come and seen and heard the activity. If you dont trust or believe these countless people who have nothing to gain by perpetrating a fraud or hoax then there's nothing else to talk about.

I've posted video where un-known voice phenomena takes places. I've posted video and audio of intelligent voice phenomena and you're still thinking with your arms folded.

STOP EXPECTING THE HOLY GRAIL OF EVIDENCE WHICH IS - you want to see an object levitate or fly across the room. That's not going to happen and thats not the measure of true evidence. While exciting to watch that can easily be created with the up most cheapest editing software.

I feel like Han Solo talking to Princess Leia in ESB "what do you like?"

a lot of skeptics i run and come in contact with have trust issues, benefit of the doubt issues which doesnt mean you cant be objective. But you run the risk of being overly objective which leads to blindess intellectually.

previous tenants, home owner, myself, countless paranormal teams, Priests, friends, family and others all cant be wrong. Its not an orchestrated conspiracy or concerted effort some of you think I'm trying to make by bringing u this info. I'm just sharing my experience. It matters not what you believe in to be honest.

but your not being honest with yourself.  You're taking pride in being a skeptic while at the same time hindering your own intellectual curiosity and basic common sense.

Outside of that I need not convince anyone else. I will continue to release the findings of those assisting me as well has publish the final report from S.E.P.

<TEXT> Sorry Para you're a skeptic by choice. Bad choice at that.  Its ok to be a skeptic but to be a skeptic and deny common sense - thats not OK.  With every evidence provided there's always going to be that human element. You want this. You want that. You want your evidence all wrapped up in a little bow before you commit to simply just believing.
Well guess what its not always going to be wrapped up in a bow. The EVP in this video is a voice talking underneath both myself and Don. The beginning of the video show Steve with his back turned sitting in the kitchen. The voice is close to the mic( for lack of a better understanding) which by definition makes this video paranormal. Only three men in the house. Two of those men are in the hallway. The voice says "SLOW" at :28 seconds and " a while" at 1:57 interjecting itself into our conversation, answering my question except for the minor detail of Don and I can't hear it. The "a while" was captured later upon review of both video and audio.


Its through diligent research and diligent investigation that stuff like this gets uncovered and I'm glad i belong now to group of men and women who are diligent about discovering it.

<TEXT> I learned as I was going through this. Some, not all. Paranormal Investigators subscribe to a ratings scale of EVP. Class A EVP is for lack of a better word a top notch EVP. The vocals are clear, concise, requires little translation-almost a true real vocal.  The different classes I'm told are Class A thru C, and D. Majority of the EVP's discovered in this HOUSE are Class A or above. Don Philips has coined the term AVP. Actual Voice Phenomena. When you have an AVP you are hearing voice without need of an electronic device.  You hear it, as if a human was talking in addition the voice recorder captures it.  Im giving loose terms and definitions, as told to me by the multiple teams have ventured into my house. Go back and listen to :28 seconds.  Tell us what you hear. I wont spoil it for you as it was just written on the YouTube comments section found by someone else. </TEXT>

EVP at 1:57 "Awhile"

Steve Mere and Don Philips came to the house in Bothell WA last January. Spent 6 days. Captured and are still compiling and analyzing 430+ EVPS. Many Class A. This is one recently discovered by me. I in monitoring their work, asking questions when a question arose did film some of their work as means of having a thought experiment. I believe and more EVPs are coming soon that support that belief that these spirits dont flee from investigators and researchers. The do the opposite. Many of the EVPs captured so far and confirmed as an EVP point to the fact these entities have a curiosity about the equipment used to investigate them. This video is just one example of that.  I soon will be sharing more EVP's off my devices. Devices I used as I shadowed these great researchers.  I was proven right as both voice recorder and hand held camcorder all have EVP'S on them.  I promise you no static.  HD EVP coming soon.  THIS AND WHAT STEVE AND DON AND S.E.P have and will share soon will show......the true level of activity i.e. intelligence that occupies this house. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Haunted House - EVP's Caught </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-24 06:18:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> https://youtu.be/IvEfxeDy3nI

(IGNORE TIME STAMP DATE ABOVE) this TOOK PLACE April 3rd 2016. This house has under gone several investigations. Most recently yielding powerful results. This house was featured on Ghost Adventures Feb 28th where they left empty handed. The only team to do so. On April 3rd 2016 these EVP's were caught with a cam and mic placed in the hallway. The infamous hallway were Bibles were burned, objects thrown and wall writing on one occasion. IMO its the most active, elusive part in the house. The place where I've seen the grey haired apparition. Whats odd is most of the EVP's caught by other teams who come after GA - the voices have been mostly male. If you compare the voice in this video to the other videos on my channel where EVP's are concerned you'll see its the same voice or very very eerily similar. Same entity? Too hard to tell? No way to be sure. What is known is the best EVP's caught in this house happen simply when cameras and mics are left running or when 1 or two people are having a conversation and the entity's listen in or respond to our dialogue. It seems one of the entities is speaking about the fall I had Jan 2nd 2014, where its admitting it wasn't a fall but more so a push?! Which to this day I still can't 100% say either way. This video is no exception in regards to THEM speaking, underneath us. If you find an EVP on this video or any other video on my channel feel free to reply and time stamp where yo heard. I think there's more on this video as well. But I'll let you decide. NOTES April 2nd 2016
:23 "Yeah"
:52, :53 something blows on the mic and at
:54 EVP voice is heard 
1:32 "Yeah"
"blah blah blah blah "semantics....I didn't fall" ??? begins at 1:47 ends at 1:53. ME AND HOUSE OCCUPANTS ARE DOWN STAIRS. Somethings at :41 but i cant make it out. Sounds like "NO" </TEXT>

<TEXT> if you're in Tacoma come on down.  Whats a 50 minute drive to prove its all a hoax.  I can easily tell you why the investigation GA conducted was not conducive to a Poltergeist haunting. Are you ready? First off timing? Poltergeist dont perform on queue. You cant tell a Poltergeist to do something let alone expect it to do it on queue.  Poltergeist are agent prone something unknown to Zak and GA is driving this activity. Could be the house?  the land underneath or the individuals living there. By asking us to leave during the majority of your investigation your limiting your success rate significantly. Did u know we had activity at the Hotel we stayed in while GA conducted their lock down?   Do you know how many times GA contacted us at the Hotel to see if the activity transferred as a result of us leaving?  Zero. They made no attempt. Neither did they put a researcher on standby just in case. 3rd investigating Poltergeist related cases are extremely hard. Its like waiting for lightening to strike. It takes time and effort. The famous of Poltergeist related cases became famous because the researchers and investigators moved into the house and investigated the home for a matter of days if not weeks and months. GA stayed for a few hours. 10 at best. That's minuscule when trying to ascertain a malevolent haunting.  if there's one thing I've learned through this true ordeal is entity's like this choose to act on their own terms. U say jump they wont jump. You say speak they wont speak. They want to be in control and own the time and when they can appear.  To make us look like fools benefits them and hurts us.  if you watch GA you will see a majority of their shows center around residual hauntings.  This is not a residual haunting. This is an intelligent haunting. The very thing you are chasing has an IQ probably bigger than Einstein. If its a demon in hiding it certainly does.  Like Angels Demons were here when God created the heaven and the earth so to think we can out smart them. out coax them is ludicrous.  The GA investigation was over before it was started.  The native american lady they interviewed for the show doesn't even live within 500 miles of here. More like 800+ across the mountains in eastern Washington. The tribes specific to this area are the snohomish and Skykomish tribes. Google the Puget Sound War and the history of Bothell and you'll see the tribe names documented here are not even the tribes GA mentioned on the show. Shall I go on? if and when you do investigate a possible Poltergeist infestation you your biggest ally is the environment. Be it the people?  the children(we have none) the land or circumstances not yet known.  The Scientific Establishment of Parapsychology interviewed me via phone, via conference call and via video chat for 2 1/2 months before they felt ample enough to visit the site and conduct an investigation. They lived with me for 6 days the 1st go round came back two months later and lived with me for 8 more days. And this time time they bought a skeptic and colleague. There here now matter of fact.

A TV show has 45 minutes to tell a story. Their approach that being Zak and crew in conducive for haunted locations, not residential. They invade urban legends and folklore places and rarely enter a domain that's active and by active I mean malevolent.  Poltergeist and demonic cases are similar in that they are intelligent hauntings. The methods used to discover them are different say the average investigative means. That's where Zak went wrong. The proof is in the puddling. 8 teams have investigated my house. Zak is the only team that left with zilch.

if the info here doesn't sway you. Nothing else will and tons more is coming.

<TEXT> My snipes are derogatory?  Money scheme? Unreal paranormal claims?  What makes it unreal? because a) U wasnt here when it happened or b) GA didnt find the demon Zak was looking for?  U loose on both debates. #1 Our claims are real, every team accept GA found and left with evidence. The claims we made are not far fetched where Poltergeist and demons are concerned. its only far fetched when some people like you reveal how little you know about malevolent hauntings.  Its only far fetched when you actually believe its possible to capture some of the unbelievable feats by Poltergeist on video cam?  Its only far fetched if you havent studied in history the 8,000 reported Poltergeist claims where objects where thrown, objects caught fire, and wall writings. Its only far fetched if you believe every claim has or messenger I should say comes forth because of money. I have money. Lots of it. I earned it.  The only rich paranormal investigators out in the world are the one's with TV shows that sold out.  Not the one experiencing true hauntings. Get real why dont you. </TEXT>

Steve and Don analyzed evidence I sent them and interviewed previous tenants months before arriving. They became very familiar with the case.  Zak and GA found out about the case in November and where filming in November/Early December.  The GA show does very few episodes on Intelligent Haunting(s) and more so Residual Hauntings or places. In short they were over there heads. And i dont mean that out of malice. If you watch all of Steve and Dons video about this haunting you can clearly see who had respect and sincere interests in all that was going on and who was there just for show.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Severe difference of opinion. Investigators and institutions alike label this an EVP. I tend to agree. This in conjunction with multiple EVP's caught in real-time when PP and SEP where here

but then again that's just me. U guys as in paranormal teams come in and find the 'voice phenomena" we live it. We hear it clear as day sometimes. 

To my GF and I its random phantom noise.

She's asking me if I put the clothes in the dryer. I say no and she's yells from downstairs "who are you talking to?"  i respond "you, Im talking to you?"

she responds "I didnt say anything?"

<TEXT> find a quote where I said a demon spray painted my office wall. You're confused. The name is this post is Poltergeist WA State.  Malevolent spirit i.e. Poltergeist i.e. Intelligent Haunting. And for the record we're ( as in us ) are narrowing the culprit down Poltergeist infestation. Or as Steve Mera refers to as a LIH. Land locked phenomena, less than 12% of Poltergeist cases fall into this segment of unknown phenomena.  When did I say this was demon?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> U dont like witnesses cause you label witnesses hearsay. You dont like EVP because you label them hard to hear. I provide you Class A, Class B and AVP and the critique is still the same. I provide you a picture of the apparition- you say thats doctored. You listen to an interview were two men (not me) admit to seeing objects moving and substantiate my claims about the camera manipulation.  You ignore everything ever written about Poltergeist, Demons and Malevolent haunting and ignore the similarities with those stories and mine.  You ridicule and point to the science community not accepting Parapsychology as a means of true science and yet you come to this forum looking for answers,  a scientist would scoff at you quicker than it would a Steve Mera, a Collin Wilson or Dr Barry Taff. two men by the way looking into my case. One has reached a startling conclusion.  No friend you dont believe in the paranormal, you believe in the ancient old idea. if it doesn't pass your smell test it can't be real.

Its EZ to be dismissive and label something fake. but you ignore your own common sense. Where theirs smoke there's always fire.  if it quacks like a duck odds are its probably a duck not duck Dynasty.

U my friend are a person posing as a paranormal believer but in fact are the purest of skeptics which in short is really a cynic.

<TEXT> Dude, why are so dense?  Do you study the paranormal?  Do you study Poltergeist.  Cameras where thrown around. Plants(pottery) did fly. Books did get knocked off book shelves. 3 Bibles got burned. Two are still missing. None of that and more is ever going to be captured by a paranormal team let alone S.E.P or anyone else for that matter. Why? Its called spurt of the moment. Its unpredictable. The entity's doing this are doing it in front of the house occupants.  Just because its not captured on video doesn't mean it didnt happen. A trillion events take place all over this world thats never captured on video.  SEP captured 420 EVP's.  Of course the science community doesn't view parapsychology favorably.   There once was a time when the scientific community didint view the Big Bang favorably. Whats your point? Its called paranormal, para-science because it exists out of the confines of science. Science will never be able to duplicate it because the environment they want to duplicate it in is sterile.

This stuff happens in homes, building, lands, property's throughout the world. Its called para-normal for a reason.

420+ EVP's is not weak evidence. Maybe for you but not for any respected paranormal team. But lets put the EVP thing aside.  You're also ignoring the trip wires going off. you're also ignoring witnessing (my friends) and previous tenants (to whom I met) after I moved in. You're also missing the apparition photo. The shadow photo. The videos of the banging, the knocking, the tapping, the lights going off and on. You're also missing or overlooking I should say individuals outside of your IQ that are respected within their field.  You're no better than Zak Bagans to think just because you personally don't see an object move or object catch fire be it on video or in person its not real.

The only thing I can say to you and others like you is why are you in this community. Everything it out of your grasp of understanding.

Outside of that you being here (in the Paranormal) community is more so as a interference runner.

<TEXT> Actually Coyotes I move in May. Jan/Feb UK and US Paranormal teams came to and conducted 3 weeks worth of investigative work. I was never going to leave until true, know what they are doing teams came in and substantiated our claims.  That was always my goal. Was it EZ staying while that took place? Nope it wasn't.

When we moved in May 2012, no one told us the house was haunted. People just vacated and left and thats fine. I get it. But me personally. I was not going to leave the next tenant with 0 data, 0 documentation, 0 evidence for the fear that had I left and not said a word a new family coming in would be blind sided and left doing proactive measures we did which made the situation worse.


The Scientific Establishment of Parapsychology is monitoring the house and all the activity therein.

<TEXT> Hello ERROR372 - evp's are not the only evidence captured. Steve and Mera witnessed teleportation/apportation. Objects (ball) in one place now existing in another. They witnessed camera movement and camera manipulation. They witnessed their own equipment being turned off and manipulated. 

There interview and account are here

The S.E.P organization led by Steve Mera is compiling the evidence and will publish the full-report when available.

As of right now 420+ EVP'S
200+ Class A

that's what they left with in addition to phenomena they witnessed with their own eyes.


They still have 80% of data to comb and filter through.

It was two months ago Keith Linder (Seattle) got in touch. He claimed he was being subject to paranormal phenomena in his home. He claimed his home was haunted.
Previously many people had attempted to assist Keith, nothing seemed to work and not even an exorcism made any difference as the disturbances would continue. A TV show who used Keith's story for one of their episodes concluded " there was no evidence". 

Determined to prove his home was haunted he turned to Don Philips and Parapsychologist Steve Mera for help from the UK. 
Prior to their arrival Don had promised Keith if his home was haunted he would show it to be, this Don managed to do with minimum effort on his part. Becky was amazing, with her vocals witnessed coming straight out of the air on x3 occasions. 
Both Fox and a reporter were also witness and testimony to the voices of those unseen.

During this visit the vale between paranormal separated during a visit to another location away from Keith's. Top tier a supernatural occurrence transpired between Don and a very negative force which even took Steve Mera out of his comfort zone during a visit to a Native Indian burial ground.. Further details on this may be released later but at this point that has not yet been decided.




Don has a sustained reputation for evidence gathering and his communications with the unseen. With the first 10 minutes of arriving at Keith's the spirits began to engage with him. Day one was focused on preparation for the investigation but although the investigation hadn't began vocal responses where captured by Don. Each following day the evidence accumulated and Steve Mera and Don would analyse it.
Despite what was stated in the past, we can confirm that Keith's home was host to genuine paranormal activity.

This clip is only a behind the scenes look at the media coverage side of things and is not intended to highlight evidence. Further evidence will become available shortly.

We would also like to thank Keith Linder for his hospitality   Patty for her assistance, both made us very welcome and our stay comfortable. This was the first time we had visited the US and it won't be the last, we plan a return visit in the near future.. In the meantime a full documentary of The Bothell Poltergeist is currently underway. Further more Don Philips has assured Keith that at the time of their visit, there was no negative entity dwelling there.

The out of sync audio and skipping video footage has been left as is. This has never occurred before and the cause remains a mystery, camera diagnostics came back without issue.

Follow Our Journey On Phenomena Project via the website / Facebook. We have been asked to investigate strange occurrences in Romania next.. Thank you for supporting this project. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed.  This is the attention I've been trying to raise and introduce to the Paranormal community for 3 years. 4 years in fact. The one Ghost Adventures took light of and missed.

S.E.P and the Phenomena Project. Both UK based flew to Seattle and investigated the house for 5 days. Averaging 19 hrs each day. Left with tons of evidence.

When complete it will be made public to the world.

<TEXT> Agreed. Fr. Roy even said Exorcisms or religious rituals generally dont work on Poltergeists.  Thats not to say a Poltergeist is stronger than a demon. No one can kill a demon. An exorcism when applied successfully does not kill or murder a demon. It just vanishes it. An exorcism on a Poltergeists simply wont vanish it because we know so little about why its there in the 1st place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thats a fair question.  Its been said and I believe this 100% with the activity heightened as it was in 2014. Not now and now for the majority of 2015. But 2014 activity was heightened moving out at that time would not mitigate the problem. Matter of fact it would make it worse. It would follow us and haunt both houses.  Thats a strong possibility. 2nd reason and it might be a wrong reason but its my reason and I will die by it.  I believe in God and his Christ. I'm no saint by any stretch of the imagination. I have my faults. My sins. But neither played a role in me getting this house. This is my 1st house. It took my whole life to get a house like this. The house is a beautiful home. I can't attest to the events prior be it the land the house was built on or the people who came before me. All I can attest is to myself, and my girlfriend. We worked hard for this house. Me especially. Running just seems to knee jerk too easy.

Doesn't mean I havent been sh* less. I have. We have. But being scared out of your mind can only do two things for you. Loose your mind or Deepen your faith.  I chose the ladder.

Obviously if I had children or pets. This would be a different scenario.  But its just me and my GF.  GF not wife. And I asked her does she want to stay. I'm staying or better yet if I leave I'm leaving on my own terms not the terms of the Ghost, Demon, or Poltergeists.

But it has not been easy and that decision weighs on me daily. Now that the house is quite I can breath a little bit and share this true story. But when we're being attacked. Being tormented. Its extremely hard. Emotionally and mentally.

And lastly when I do leave. I want to provide the next home owner information I didnt have. odds are the next home owner will have children. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes contacting the previous tenants was something I began doing in 2012, and finally succeeded in 2014.  5 families have lived in the house prior to us.  One came forward and stated the house for them was "crazy" and a "living hell" I was able to catch up with them after I got their mail. I then found her on Facebook. Below is a tidbit of that conversation.

Keep in mind the violence has subsided for the most part. We did dial back the cams and the Christian elements AFTER WE realized it might be and is a Poltergeist vs. a Demon.  The evidence and the patterns just point to Poltergeist and Poltergeist are notorious for fighting back at you with your own weapons perse. That and the previous tenants comments sort of helped us reach that conclusion. There is still noises, knocks, occasional door opening and closing by itself.  The violence has subsided.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> There have been moment of fear.  GF was scratched 3 times.  We've woken up and discovered the sheets underneath us ripped to shreds.  On the time line you will see Jan 2013 I had a fall.  We never attributed the fall to the ghost because by Jan 2014 all the 2012 had subsided. But when the entity came back March/April just weeks after i finally mended from a patella tear knee surgery the thought or idea got revisited.  It was a bad fall. I fell from the top stair of my home. It took 4 ambulances to get me out of the house I'm 6"5 1/2.  1st 3 vehicles were just to small.  But anyways the other moments of fear are the rib cage pokes while sleeping.  The feeling of your personal space being invaded-something invisible standing very close to you.  When lights go off during while showering and the door slams-yeah those are very nerve wrecking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello "getinthegoddamcar" The workings of Poltergeists whole heartedly resemble the workings of an angry teenager or human period. The name Poltergeists means "Noisy Ghost"  aka Poltergeist a ghost or other supernatural being supposedly responsible for physical disturbances such as loud noises and objects thrown around. Example:  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2975035/Poltergeist-maliciously-terrorised-home-four-months-writing-threatening-messages-hurling-knives-bullets-rooms-attempts-exorcise-FAILED.html </TEXT>

As I mentioned before when events began to happen early you ignore, shrug off, scratch your head, and then the WTF moment occurs. An object levitates or gets thrown.  

Then comes the moment where we begin reaching out to friends, co-workers(sensitive to this subject matter) church, clergy and friends.

The links, photos, videos below are the reactions the Poltergeist gave us to us carrying out others suggestions. Many of these suggestions people heart was in the right place. Its important that I mention that.

1st Bible burning
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140331_021627889.jpg

All the lights in the hallway(ceiling) were yanked out. Wires exposed and the glass light fixture-exploded
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140329_233000205.jpg

Floor beneath the exploding light fixture. Thats a Bible on the ground. This Bible in the coming days would be burned. For now its just thrown off the book shelf and all bulbs and glass exploded. All at once. Mind you.
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140329_232954380_1.jpg

Broken Glass/Light Dome Fixture or Disk Shaped I should say.
About a 1.2 inch thick. 3 of them in the hallway exploded
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140330_124227024.jpg

2nd Bible Burned
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140406_114946652.jpg
Went missing off the hall book shelf. Found hours later on the kitchen island-scortched

Wall Scratches
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140525_092020915.jpg
Burned wall marks from Poster fire.

Cross taken off wall. Went missing for a week.  Was found in washing machine while machine was running.
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140524_151512188.jpg


Shredded Bible on the hallway floor. Interesting enough the black wire you see is a wire to a hallcam. The camera did not catch the event unfolding.  Power loss to the hallway and office happened prior or must have happened prior.
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140601_155025158.jpg

I know because when I came home 3-4 black printer papers was in my printer tray.  Pwr loss triggers the printer to print test pages.

This is my hallway on a typical day. Minus the hammer present.  Bible on the shelf. A candle(white candle) and a Sage tray.  We pray, recite the Lords prayer and keep the Bible open typically to Psalms or Proverbs.
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140630_204826658.jpg
This Bible is now missing . But it has been manipulated as the next link will show.

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140701_220119775.jpg
see the Bible. The chair has been split in half and the stem rested on the Bible. Open Bible mind you.
Upside down cross written on the wall. The cross that was in the hallway on the wall is stabbed into the office wall.

The entity took the sage stick and with the ash end wrote a upside down cross on the office floor.  Many sage sticks go missing. Some has self lit themselves.

Hallway. Bible, cross and prayer documents are thrown on the floor. Cross , Bible and prayer documents are now missing

(FYI) That step ladder is the step ladder BUMPS paranormal team witnesses being teleported. Its listed in their report.


See the hole in the hallway, middle left of the pic.  The scattered debris on the floor is a sage tray. Went projectile, was launched and lodged into the wall.  The stem left that hole. Tray exploded on impact. I was in my office when this happened. Objects travel like missiles

same night we came home to discover weird puddles of water on the kitchen floor.

Advised by some to keep buckets of water mixed with salt in every room.  This plate and the water therein would get tossed and thrown

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/Oct16th_BedroomD.jpg

This Bible is now missing. You've seen it in the office.
Its wet because the bucket of water we had in the bedroom was poured over it.  I was in the shower. when I got out the shower this Bible was in the doorway soaking wet. The bucket of salt water was missing or empty I should say. Plate would later get thrown and destroyed and the Bible is now missing.

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/Oct16th_BedroomB.jpg

Same cross that went missing and re-appeared in the washing machine while on. This was Halloween night. Same night cross on the wall was burned. Same night the puddles of water appeared
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20141017_211242273.jpg

Dish that held the recommended salt/water.

Necklace is a means for protection. The card was given to me a patron inside a Christian Bible store.  No one knows the ink or solution used to write "Die KL."

Priest, Shaman and Spokane Haunts Paranormal Team(Spokane WA) discuss our case via conference call:  Spring 2015

A paranormal team watching and monitoring the home 24/7 even with me there or when I'm at work or out of town on business finally get the best lead of all this apparition posted up on the masterbedroom door.

The female apparition I've described on previous accounts of actually seeing and I even drew it one night after it appeared at the bottom step of the living room.

GF and myself were raised in the Baptist church. Deep southern roots Such roots you cling to when something albeit remote and usual occurs.   Things suggested by friends, family, paranormal teams and clergy include saging, house blessing, cleansing, spraying holy water, anointment of house and ourselves. This and more we tried and with the addition to the cameras and video cams. Activity spiked and took off.

That too some speaks of Poltergeist. I end with  quote of Fr. Roy. The priest who did the 1st exorcism on the house and who is still engaged with the case.

"  I do think that what is left is probably poltergeist.  I think the Native American spirit or demon is gone or at least placated.
 
Peace,
 
Roy"

<TEXT> Thanks, its been a steep learning curve. not all paranormal teams have been perfect. The Catholic Church didn't respond right away and do some degree came kicking and screaming. Fr. Brian never doubted our story but the environment the world is in right everybody is timid. Everybody is afraid of being led down a path of hoaxes.  Its not hoaxes. Its not fake. This situation is cookie cut and easy to describe and explain.  A couple: GF and I move into a house. On day one weird stuff started happening. Logically we ruled it out as most people would. Its easy to shrug off the early stuff.  Whats hard or near impossible to shrug are the objects being thrown. There is no rational explanation for objects to rise by themselves and go flying across a hall or room.  That event doesn't make our experience unique. Suffice what the skeptics say these events are happening all-over the world in all typed of homes. 99% never get reported.  I personally feel its my responsibility to report it and I'm reporting it because I believe it deserves to be shared among alike minds. I have to believe there's someone out their be they a person, or organization suitable for handling this sort of information. Be it TABS, SEC, GhostBusters "R: or who ever. Someone needs to be made aware of this stuff in addition to the paranormal community.  I was referred here. I'm glad I'm here. I'm sharing a true story. A true experience.  Thanks for understanding.  Be safe knowing there are a few people, few out of many that are helping. To them I am forever grateful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you very much. Fr Roy of the Episcopal church near Seattle. Reached out to us and did the 1st full exorcism on the house. He's over 80yrs old, retired. He has documented 7 previous demonic cases and assisted us in July of last year.  He openly admitted he's never seen a entity this active and this extreme.

<TEXT> email me privately. The east coast team led by Karissa Fleck and Nikki will be spending days and weeks at the house soon to do a thorough investigation. We are looking at LIVE feed and 24/5 LIVE monitoring. In addition to them a UK team traveling from England will arrive Jan 21st.  This is not fake. That I can vouch and promise. Its weird. The activity has subsided for now (Knock on Wood) so right now we're sort of in a holding period. The events that happen now are minuscule and far few in between. Two weeks ago our garage door went up and down by itself.  Woke up and discovered it open. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Friends have witnessed it.  Individuals from two Paranormal Teams. Jennifer founder of No Bull Paranormal and her team were the 1st to respond Spring of 2014.  They witnessed the house humming.  Her Sage stick self lit when she tried to perform a cleanse ritual. BUMPS paranormal co-founder Kyle and team witnessed a step ladder teleport. A cast iron candle stick holder slid across the floor before everyone. Kyle saw a sliding closet door on its own and heard a growl.  Our friends Tina and mine have heard the loud bangs, foot steps and seen objects thrown.  When we tried the cameras aimed at cameras all that would happen is equipment malfunction. Camera goes missing or camera gets thrown.

<TEXT> As I stated B4, video cams and motion cameras where installed and kept on 24/7 monitoring.  Cameras would go missing. Let me back up. 1st cameras would be unplugged. We plug them back in.  2nd Then cameras went missing. We'd buy new one's.  The new cameras would then go missing and get destroyed.  So your idea is valid. It has merit. But its been tried over and over and over and each time a camera gets destroyed or goes missing or better yet the power cut to that camera the activity in the home escalates ten fold.  I'm all ears for a solution that mitigates that should the activity spike again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably the biggest mistake I've made in dealing with this is the mistake I'm about to share with you. One of the biggest annoyances a malevolent entity can do to you is deprive you of sleep.  We all know sleep deprivation leads to aggravation,irritation, frustration - the pillars if you will of making a mistake.  That mistake being OPENLY CHALLENGING A POLTERGEIST.  And thats exactly what I did.  It was a week night. The house was active. Active while we were sleeping.  After 2am or 3am door knocking, tapping, foot steps and stomping sounds coming from the ceiling. Some times right above our heads.  I'm sad and some what embarrassed to say (but try to understand us as being the one's being tormented, the victim) we hear this daily, and by 8 months plus of this particular nuisance u get or try to become numb to it.  But you have bad nights and this night was bad. So bad little sleep was gotten and once the 5am alarm clock run which means get up, shower and shave. Join your peers in an 1hour+ travel commute where 99.99999% of people in cars and van pools next you had anything similar to the kind of night my GF and I had.

BUT before I leave for work I must leave the Poltergeist a piece of my mind.  Its almost too humorous to admit. Idiocy. 

I walk into my office. Yank two blank sheets of paper out of the printer and write and after writing tape the paper unto the TV and walls of my office. The same office where two fires took place. The most active room in the house. I write these notes (see below) and head out the house.

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140703_065027366.jpg

and

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140703_065015843.jpg

Prior to doing this the activity was centered around the house. Meaning GF and I both would witness stuff or be at odds places of the house-something erupts and we rush to it and witness it together. Those are un-easy things to experience.  But at least you have each other to depend on.  Stuff happening to you both albeit fearful still provides you a benefit of not being alone.

And there have been times where stuff happened where one of us experienced and the other person didnt. But those events are far few and between. I call those instances residual presence still being felt.

Meaning the stuff she and I experienced while the other was away happened within minutes of the other person leaving the home.

Once I took it upon myself to post notes. Notes directly aimed at the Poltergeist. Calling it out if you will.  The house stopped being attacked.  I started being attacked.  Examples below are real

1. Sitting in my office and objects are now being thrown inside my office. Missing me by inches. At first objects got thrown in the hallway. Objects like beer bottles, wine bottles, candles, cologne bottle. All glass.  
2. Taking a shower and while showering the bathroom door slams.  GF is gone. Just me there
3. Taking a shower and minutes later when I step written on the wall is a upside down cross. Lotion or soap used.
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140624_222004768.jpg
4.  Like some when I get ready for work I go into my closet and grab the clothes I'm going to wear and lay them on the bed. When I get out of the shower  and gran my shirt I see every button is gone.
5. Have gotten dressed. Usually after I get dressed within 10 minutes I'm out the door. I wear button downs shirts.  By time I get down stairs and reach for the door knob every button on my shirt is gone. This has happened 4 times. 
6.  How about sitting on the toilet, using the bathroom.  The bathroom door slams, before slamming something clicks the light switch off, slams the door shut
7. Light goes off and door slams while taking a shower
8. Loud bang from the wall inside the shower stall
9. Cleaning the kitchen back is turned and Pottery goes flying.
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20141213_140635397.jpg
10. Taking a shower and coming out the shower and discovering the shirt you placed on the bed is hanging on the wall.
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20141207_202920597_1.jpg
11.  Objects with holy water go flying in the house
a) Dish in tact
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/Oct16th_BedroomD.jpg
b) Same dish thrown through the air like a frisbe. Come crashing in my office. My back was turned.
c) http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20141022_204301825_HDR.jpg
12. Pages in Bible ripped to shredds
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140601_155025158.jpg

13. Chair
The chair I sit in in the kitchen is most manipulated chair in the house. Has even been placed in my office a few times
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140630_180222917_HDR_1.jpg
14. Watch goes missing.  watch is missing for a few days. Tina finds it in my sink and texts me
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/watch_missing.jpg
15.Light fixture(disk shaped) goes missing. Is launched into my room and leaves a dent.
Missed be by inches.  Totally unexpected.
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20141225_160012836.jpg
16. Every non digital photo i.e. tangible photo of me, even its with other people. My face is burned off.
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/Pic1KeithC.jpg

http://s299.photobucket.com/user/subject1320/media/Stafford%20Way/Pic1Keith.jpg.html?sort=3 o=254

Pictures that were tucked away in boxes that I forgot even existed. began appearing in the office and hallway book shelf with my face burned off.

I mentioned previously the "Die KL" wall markings
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/KL_Die1.jpg

Head Board bed scratches
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/20150703_115511.jpg

Lastly!

there are tons more.  The mental component darkens and deepens.

2nd pair of car keys go missing. I keep these buy my side or in a safe. $500 to replace.

The bed shakes. The poking of the rib cage while sleeping. The biting down on your feet. The yanking of the sheets while sleeping. The yanking of the sheets while sleeping in a Hotel room away from home.

The instance at work one day, while working at my desk I get spun around total 360 by an invisible shoulder check.  Something bumps me on my shoulder and spins me around. 

Leaving a friends goodbye party down town Seattle and get to my car. every door is wide open. Nothings missing.

Door bell rings 5am in the morning on a weekday. Its my next door neighbor. Every car door is wide open(my car).

It got so bad with me, and me only being attacked or messed with that my GF and I would leave the same time for work.  It just got to be too dangerous with me in the house and her leaving.

House black out as she's pulling out the drive way. Iron or Iron Board being thrown as she's backing out the drive way.

The activity spiked and centered 99% around me once I left those notes on the wall.

There's an old proverb that says "never go to war with someone who buys their ink by the bulk"

I see these shows were the ghost hunter openly challenges the spirit to a dual or worse and the ghost hunter leaves unscathed.

Maybe there are. Maybe they aren't messed with

I can tell from my experience you will be.  Doing so plays right into the hands of the entity.

<TITLE> 2nd and 3rd Bible Burning / WHY </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-13 00:46:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think Ashalon understands and shares my sentiment. [ "Now the Bible was taken because I put emphasis on it." It could have been any book or object, but you thinking about it probably puts some kind of energy around it.]  

The items that began missing at the very beginning were items common to Poltergeist haunting. Car keys, silverware, cups, jewelry, etc.  Items that took us days to miss. After we started displaying our religious beliefs openly - a tide if you will switched. The items being displayed began to go missing that includes cameras to record events.  Activity so many here want to see and worse than that the crosses and Bibles we put out to warn off demonic entity's.  Since there's no way to be sure what is our thinking and the urging of others was leave no stone un-turned.

Keep in mind by this time frame.  Churches be they from the Baptists, Episcopal, and Catholics houses of God were paying house visits. The house was blessed. The house was cleansed. room by room. Upstairs and downstairs. The local parish, (The Priest seen the pic here, is being kept up to date).  Visits by the local Parish have now become weekly after Aug 2014.

Catholic Communion and Mass was held summer 2014
same time frame when the 2nd and 3rd Bibles took place.
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/Symbols_Stafford_way/Mass%20August%2013th%202014/2014-08-15_9-30-41.jpg

The items being taken now are the items we are in fact putting energy behind. We're not wrong for praying, we're not wrong for reciting Proverbs, and Psalms and drilling into our belief symptom but on the flip side of all that is a Poltergeists that observes us 24/7. Observes who ever comes in that house 24/7 and by taking items, religious items we display its telling us cliche methods don't work on me.

The first Bible that got burned. Woke us up in the middle of the night. There were actual flames. I could feel the heat on my face when I opened the bedroom door. That same level of heat that set off the fire alarms

The 2nd Bible burn - also happened while we were home but no alarm went off.  If you look at the pages. There crispy, folded in. its almost as if the Bible was opened and the pages purposely sat under a heat lamp. A very hot heat lamp that would burn the pages slowly.  When I found this Bible sitting on the Kitchen Island there was no smoke smell. The Bible at most was missing maybe 11 hrs. We went to bed it was still on the shelf. We woke up it was gone.  We weren't even up an hour before it returned. 

Look at the 3rd Bible burning. This one was burned while we were at work. The house was attacked, camera alerts went off and shot off emails to me. I come home and find this.  The pages burned on this Bible is more darker. The ashes are jet black. Might have something to do with both the paper and the ink itself.  There's noway of knowing if it set off the fire alarm which i must add it very close by.

But the 3rd Bible is significant and should raise the eye brow to anyone investigating Poltergeist and Demonic infestations.

3 Bibles were burned in this house. The 3rd Bible would be the first Bible ever burned while we are away.
2nd Bible Burning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVZVtcjZzgo

We came home and found the 3rd Bible on the shelf, all Bibles are kept and the page and passages incinerated . Mind you its sitting on a wooden book shelf. Two shelves.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjkYw2kleBU

Which gives evidence to the argument that Poltergeists, or malevolent entities for that matter have the ability to burn a house down. But CHOOSE not to do so.

3rd Bible Burning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjkYw2kleBU

Also the entity is doing activity when both occupants are gone. No agent as some theorists like to cling to.

This would be last Bible to burn in the house. It would not be last Bible to be attacked i.e. go missing, or get thrown or even soaked in water.  Three more fires would take place. One cross will be burned on Halloween 2014/Nov 1st.

Wooden cross
Bought it at Goodwill and hung it in the Living Room

1. 2 Bibles are missing
2. Virgin Mary statue
3. Holy Water is missing
4. Michael the Archangel statue is missing
5. 2-3 wooden crosses are missing.

Its ok to be afraid. This is some really outlandish stuff. But no matter how outlandish it seems to your eyes and ears. Its 100% true and it happened 2012 - 2015.  And the investigation continues.

Most of the events happened when both of us are at work. 60% that is. 30% happens while we're home together. 5% with just me and 5% with just here. Around Oct 2014 till February 2015 the attacks began to center on me.

<TEXT> Thanks.  The belief now among several people investigating the house including the Priest who did the exorcism was we're dealing with a Poltergeists.  The doings, workings, and attacks just point to a clever, elusive Poltergeists that when provoked unleashes crazy attacks as most Poltergeists do.  I try to stand clear of the word demon, even though I believe in demons. I believe in God. Therefore I believe in Satan and the Devil. Is that what occupies this house?  I dare not say.  What I will say is the events be they past events and what transpires now does fit the profile of a Poltergeist.  Ironically Poltergeists are the hardest cases to solve let alone ascertain.

<TITLE> The Throwing of Heavy Objects </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-10 09:26:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Things start off subtle with Poltergeist haunting. Objects being thrown is no exception.  The first things to go flying (even with friends present) were flower pots. A 4 foot Ivory plant - this plant here ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbWXXnjfB9E ) rose up while GF and I were watching TV. Summer 2012. It seems LIKE once something happens - events of a similar nature happen more frequently. It's like a seal has been broken. A Pandora's box if you will. Pretty soon plants began flying daily.


1. I was doing dishes(loading the dish washer) back turned to the kitchen and living room - when I heard a loud noise. Turned around plant was that sits by the wall was laying on the floor. July 2012. Remember we moved in May 2012.

2. This is the plant that flew one night during Monday night football. Sits in the den. This plant flew or was thrown so many times it finally died. We couldn't salvage it anymore. I was thrown from one side of the room to the other no less than 5 times. Twice when company was over. Its significant because after it was thrown the LOUD bangs began and other paranormal activity. Lights Off and On. Pacing, Thuds, and door slams. Prior to it being thrown objects were coming up missing and objects neither of us owned began appearing. Esp kid toys.

3. This event has to be interesting to somebody. By this stage of the game Aug/Sept 2012. LOUD Bangs were pretty much every night. I think I saw the female apparition before this plant got thrown either give or take a week or two.  The night this plant got thrown GF and I were trying out an idea friends had told us. Friends recommended we attempt to make communication with the entity.  With kid toys popping up everywhere we were still of this mindset this thing could be friendly. Lost but friendly. After this night we stopped thinking that. Sitting at the kitchen table with the voice recorder my sister mailed me. She's a Dr, so she mailed me the voice recorder she used while in school.  GF and I are sitting at the table asking questions we found online. Very mundane. Questions like why are you here?  what do you want? whats your name?  Please go into the light?  After a few questions the bar stool behind us got thrown and the plant sitting on the wine rack few feet behind us got thrown, well actually it got slammed to the ground. Both bar stool and plant were just a few inches from us. After that night we stopped trying to talk to the spirit. This was summer 2012.  You should know the voice recorder my sister gave me- the one she used while in med school that she parted with because she knew of our problem. That voice recorder went missing a few days later after that plant got thrown down to the floor.  Its still missing.

4. I saved the best for last. This is the 300+ lb Amour that when we moved in it took 3 of us to carry this thing upstairs.  Its a B* tch to move. I hate this thing. It doesn't lend itself for grabbing. The edges are bulk and sharp.  When we got it upstairs we planted it never hoping to move it again. I'm 6"5 1/2 . This Amour is about 6"3.  After a 1 1/2 of no activity the Amour was sitting in the hallway. It would be the 1st thing thrown when the Poltergeist left and came back i.e. became active again.  This 300+ was resting on a wall and when thrown was thrown from side of the hallway to the other. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

After being tossed in the hallway two more times we moved it painstakingly into one of the guest bedrooms. Not to prevent it from ever being thrown again. But to save the walls in the hallway. This was spring 2014 mind you. Hence came the cameras months later

After the cameras were erected the activity got worse and this same Amour would be tossed a few more times inside the guest bedroom.

Video is a video of the Amour erect in the bedroom.  Yeah weird light action to.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4R_32gpK64
It doesn't look no where near like this now.

if needed I can provide a pic of how it looks now.  Right now its a poor imitation of what an Amour should be. You child could probably bring it down stairs now if needed.

This is the Amour laying on its face.

I wish to God I could relate or paint a perfect picture to you of what its like to see let alone hear an object this big being thrown. Its not so much the size thats haunting vs the sound.  These things happen abruptly. Totally unexpected.

You're chilling with your girl or are in your house just living your life. I'm watching TV upstairs. GF might be watching TV down stairs or on the phone with a friend or family member. Or we might be having dinner when all of a sudden a LOUD CRASH. A loud thud, or BANG. There is no precursor for when objects get thrown especially the BIG items.  After it happens you're running trying to find your partner before anything else.  a noise that loud could only mean someone just got hurt. Once you reconvene and meet in the hallway or the bottom of the stairs you look at each other almost pale white.  You then go looking for the noise.  When you find the root cause or after math your mouth drops wide open.

I have to give it everything I've got to raise this Amour back up. Everything I've got. I'm 6"5 1/2 250 lbs.

I'm a tall, big guy.  When it goes flying its flying ladies and gentlemen. You dont want to be in the path of it and its final resting place.

This is what I want people to understand about Poltergeist and Demons.

2-3 yrs a go I was stupid and naive. I was running around erecting cameras without a clue as to what I was facing.

I dont think people who suggest try this, try that totally understand the repercussions of such actions.

TV personalities make it look funny and silly. Its not.

The next time you're having dinner with your wife, or GF try to think of a plane crashing through your ceiling some part of the house where you can't see.  Better yet try to imagine that when you're asleep.

If you can imagine that you might be able to understand the term Malevolent Haunting.

<TEXT> Just me and my girlfriend live in the house. I would say no.  Having done thorough research of the house I was able to get in contact with the previous tenants. Both wife and son suffered major emotional issues.  Son developed meningitis and became very ill-8 odd yrs a go.  Wife fell into alcoholism and deep physical and emotional abuse from her Ex husband.  That in addition to the land being on old controversial Native American ground its one theory out of several currently being looked at.

<TITLE> 1st Bible Burning </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yeah the title is correct 1st Bible. I have to distinguish it because we had 3 Bibles burn in our house. And please its not what you think it is. 

The 1st Bible to burn went missing in summer/fall 2012.  That Bible would return March 2014. Missing for over a year and a half before returning.  The question is why did it go missing in the 1st place?

Like I said before we began experiencing LOUD bangs, cabinet doors open, flying plants, raising plants, foot steps, thuds, lights going off and on at will.   After about 4-6 weeks of that I began informing friends, clergy and family for assistance. One of the recommends was Sagging and displaying our religious beliefs out openly.

The night the Bible went missing my GF was out of town.  A co-worker recommended I sage the house. To cleanse.  I got home with sage in hand and began sagging.  As I was sagging the masterbedroom I heard the sound of running.  By time I got to the door and to the hallway landing - I could see from the 2nd floor landing with a clear view of the front door. The front door opened and slammed shut. Something invisible obviously darted passed me. I saw the front door open. ADT Alarm even said "Front Door Open" and the door slammed shut.

I took that as a sign as of the sagging actually working. After all it appeared something just ran out of the house.

Hours later I was on the phone with my best friend he urged that I leave a Bible out in the open and chapter open to Psalms. I placed the Bible out on one of the lamp tables and went to bed. 

The next morning I woke up house still heavy with sage.  From my landing you can see the down stairs. When u step out of my bedroom you step into the hallway landing. When I looked over the rail I immediately notice the Bible was gone.  Now the Bible was taken because I put emphasis on it.   Its not like we were one day having dinner and all of a sudden out comes a flaming Bible. Now GF was in Vegas on business.  I was home alone.

By this stage of the game friends of ourse have seen objects fly. Objects get thrown and have heard the loud bangs. The recommends coming from friends, co-workers, and clergy is display your religious belief openly. I'm not criticizing their advise. I'm calling out a Poltergeists reaction to it. 

Exorcisms where Poltergeists are concerned can at times be a means of provoking the entity. Challenging the angry spirit. Remember the sole purpose for objects being thrown, and bangs is to get attention.  Placing a Bible on a coffee table, or lamp table is no exception.  

FastForward: For the most part 2013 was quiet. By Nov-December the activity was subsiding. Of course Bible was still missing. As was other objects.

 But something about 2013 just didnt sit right with me. occasional, about every other month weird things would still happen.  TV channels would change by themselves. Fire alarm one night rang by itself but there was no fire. The thing that felt weird the most was the feeling of being watched.  2013 would soon end minus any major activity-minus any violent activity.

By March that would change. A Sunday night, nothing usual about it.  Typical Sunday night. We went to bed. 2 months after my knee surgery.  We heard a loud bang in the hallway. It woke us up.  Nothing found so we went back to bed. 30 minutes later a loud thud and crash. The Amour in the hallway had been thrown from wall to the other leaving a major dent in the wall it was resting on.  After that day. Events happened daily. 2012 all over again.

This time we called Paranormal Team. A team came over about a week or so later. Did an 1 hour investigation. 

When they left we went to bed.   Hours later we were awaken by the house fire alarm.  When I opened up the bedroom double doors there on the floor was a book on fire. Looked like a small camp fire.

I think i used my foot or hands to close the book to put out the fire. I then after closing it realized it was the Bible. The missing Bible taken summer/fall 2012.

Inside it was burned wooden cross. That cross was hanging above our heads. Over the bed.  Pages all burnt and ash everywhere.

We tried calling the Paranormal Team that came over just hours prior.  No answer. It would be midday Monday before they got my voice mail.

Equally shocked as we were.

<TEXT> I didn't see this earlier. Once again great mind think alike. I laid out talcum powder to try to catch our culprit. Zero success. One upside down cross was drawn on the restroom mirror. Aside from that all the other writings always took place in my office.  Where these writings done while you were home?  Away? Or sleep? Ours was always while we were away. No writings ever took place while we were home.  Do you have photo's of the Poltergeist workings, shenanigans, and after math attacks?  I'm learning so much from your account. The similarities are astounding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah the puddle of water only happened once. That was Halloween Oct 31st. I learned puddles of water is a strong indicator of Poltergeist activity.  Came home to that and this burnt cross on the wall.  Cross was always there but it was scorched around the edges.

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20141109_125735320.jpg

I know all to well about the cabinets being open. Like I said the 1st time that happened we had company over. And you're right zero sound. We sat a few away in the next room. Heard nothing.  Bar stools and chairs got relocated all the time

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20141101_024941079.jpg

You above anyone else might appreciate this video. The video is made from the mail alert emails I got while at work on movement in the house i.e. kitchen and office.  watch the chairs and left side of couch area. snap shot pics taken by my camera in the time frame shown.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwhyfd8A3EQ

My occupation?  I'm a IT project manager for a IT hardware manufacturer company.  I would say my GF keeps her feelings more inside than me. It was hard to tell where her mind was at most times. Or get her to share her feelings. Not so much about me just the other things going on in her world, her life be it work or family related.  I can tell our Poltergeists seized on disagreements, and arguments. It caused a few and some it failed in causing. These things do instigate and ours did all the time. I started noticing how it instigated and pretty soon we started have deep conversations away from the home. We'd go to the neighborhood starbucks if we thought a conversation was going to lead to a debate.  Having said that I also want to reiterate some of the most crazy level of activity stemmed from light hearted moments to.   I had LOUD bangs and objects thrown during Monday Night football with the eyes. Light fixtures exploded when Tina was in the house by herself.  My office caught fire when only I was there.  I have enough data for every scenario.

One thing is for sure from Fall 2014 to February 2015. major activity like candled being thrown also came after subtle activity like lights going off and on.

<TEXT> Hi NASA_ .,  thats been the upmost unsolved mystery to me and to us. And by us I mean clergy, paranormal teams, researchers, and myself. There are documented cases of a Poltergeist jumping. There are documented cases of a Poltergeists following its victims from home to work even. Those cases are 1 out of a 100. Extremely rare. A lot of things about this case change the paradigm or understanding I should say about what we "think" we know about Poltergeists. Keep in mind we think its a Poltergeists because of some of the actions its done that fit what previous Poltergeists cases.  But there are things its done that haven't been seen much before. As it is with most cases. All cases be they demon, Poltergeist or Ghost related offer its own uniqueness. What makes this case compelling is the length of time its been around. 3 families in a 10 year time frame is unheard of. Poltergeist attached to land or building have happened before. There occurrence is extremely rare. And by being are means we have less to go on-study wise and information wise. 90% of Poltergeists that are real cases we think lend themselves to people. People are the root cause albeit through some mental component. 10% or less are tied to some physical elements like land or property.

the number could be higher. Might be higher. We just don't know. People could be running into this issue and simply moving.As someone posted the Eddie Murphy video earlier. Simply move and be done with it. So the case and experience goes un-reported. The people who move don't have attachments because they weren't in the house long.  Others move in after them and experienced nothing because there DNA persona doesn't trigger or activate the Poltergeist.  Its just interesting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello thanks for answering. So when you tell me about the TV and demand channels and stuff being of predestined, predetermined channels "Ghostly Movies" I'm right there with you. Your history and recount is doing volumes for me. Providing me great info because we've had something similar. You'll see in my time line in 2014 we had a incident I labeled the "Katie Perry" incident. Yes Katie Perry the singer.  It was a Friday about the time when the activity was kicking back up Spring 2014. The TV in our master bedroom kept coming on and when it came on the TV screen was black but blasting from it was the Katie Perry song titled: Black Horse . And the lyrics playing was [ So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back]

GF and I would run into the room look a blank TV screen blasting. Screen was blank but the channel was One Sixty Something, i forgot exactly.  We'd look at each other and say "WTF" I then would turn the TV off. Manually. We'd leave. 5-10 minutes later TV would blast again same volume level. Same black screen and same lyrics above.  I then un-plugged the TV and we left the room.

Minutes later the TV came screaming again with that same song, same lyrics. Now the overall length of this ordeal was 10+ minutes. Maybe even 15 minutes. The song is nowhere near that long. I an see a TV coming on a new song be playing every time. After all time moves forward not backward.  But for 15 minutes or less the TV kept coming on and that song was playing and just those lyrics.  Ladies and gentlemen I swear to God this happened. You can't make this stuff up. Truth is stranger than fiction and Poltergeists are no exception. So I know how you feel sharing that part of your story. But trust me you don't have to worry. It all makes sense. There's stories I've yet to tell because even though they happened last year or the year before I'm still mentally coming to terms with them. My whole reason for coming to a site like this and sharing my ordeal. our ordeal is I have to believe others, as in modern people have experienced something very similar to what we experienced. My 2nd reason for coming here is years from now when someone has their own Poltergeists experience that they leap to the internet like I did. Like we did and share there story. I hope there doing there own research. This info helps. Your info helps me. Helps us.  People can laugh and shrug, giggle, scream hoax all the want.  When the "devil" bites your ass and comes to your house to play with you and your loved one's we'll see who's screaming hoax then.  These things can avoid detection. Avoid the being captured by the most skilled Paranormal Investigator. if something can make a TV play by itself minus being plugged in a wall or control a TV like you mentioned in your story - do people seriously think hiding cams around a house to catch something is going to work? Doesn't means we shouldn't try.  But the fact that it doesn't has no bearing on the house occupant making stuff up.  Thats my rhetorical question and soap box for today.  You Christoforever has lived and witnessed something 99% of the worlds population has yet to see or ever experience.  Your story offers a begin date that seems to correspond with your girlfriend?  Stress and strife and etc does play a major role in some of these cases. Not all. But some. I have more to share and seen. PS. So days after the Katie Perry sorry the activity sky rocked and became relentless. It was like the verse to that song was a omen i.e. prediction as to what was about to come.  After that song played-we had activity everyday. Each day got out did by the next.   Continue to share anything you might recollect.  I will as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually I can put the items being thrown or missing in two categories. Common items, items we gave little thought about but would be missed within 30-60 days. Ex. 2nd set of car keys-never used them. Moved them from point A to point B. Old Apartment(A) to the new house(B). I noticed the keys gone after moving into the new house, days later. Never used the keys they were spares. Ex. Music CD's I ordered online of Amazon. Hard to find CD on the net but I had them for months. There gone now. Sat on my office desk.

The other items moved or thrown were objects the clergy, the church, friends and family say display to warn of negative entities.  Ex. Sage sticks, Bibles(3) burned. 2 other Bibles ripped in half. One Bible is still missing. Other objects thrown or missing are cameras obviously, white candles, wooden crosses, Michael the Archangel statue and a wooden Virgin Mary given to us by the local Priest.

So its not so much objects we focused on except the one's we were advised to display. Interesting enough a St. Benedict cross that hangs over the entry door has yet to be touched.  

My GF has her own stories of house attacks. Later in 2014 when I'm out of town on business her BFF would spend the night and they both would be attacked in my absence.  I once got emails from my monitoring cams that mass motion and sound is being detected why she was en route to the house from work. I've had delay entry. Meet me at starbucks and we go into the house together.  She's found the house upside down a few times.  I have to. 

The first fire I was in the house alone. The 2nd fire we both were sleeping and got awoken to it.

Us and others don't think the entity is tied to us. We based that on two key facts. Two previous families (tenants) came forth and spoke of similar activity.

The land, city, and county has rich Native American history.  We think the rich native american history might be a reason why it attacks Christian symbols. But that might be a false positive because Poltergeist by definition respond negatively to removal tactics.  The violence we get is like its telling us these counter measures are an insult to it.

We also think the reason why it attacks me more vs. my GF is I'm the one who's most active in trying to rid it. I'm the most active doing research about it. One night after 0 sleep due to the loud bangs and shaking of the bed I got up and challenged it. Bad move.


It took the gloves off and began attacking me 24/7. Home, work, and abroad.

Questions:

How big was the 1st house?  How old was that house?
Who's in the house now? Have you followed up with them to see if they are having activity?
From start to finish how long would you say the activity was?
What type of electrical issues took place? TV's? Radios?  Cell phone?

Did you ever feel like it was creating animosity between you two. Stirring up dissension?

Might sound weird me saying this but I like the fact that Paranormal teams came in and got little evidence with gadgets. The techniques applied by Paranormal Teams. 90% of it doesn't work.

5 teams have been to my house. 4 have seen with their own eye's. All their equipment died. At most they left with high EMF and weird temp signatures upstairs.

Most of their experience has been with their naked eyes.
One actually was kicked. The other heard a growl.

A Shaman came in and saw the cabinet door close on its own.

This Bible is missing:

<TEXT> Its believed these spirits can't cross major bodies of water. Permanently. meaning if you take up new residence. I've been bombarded a few times in my Hotel room while traveling on business.  I'll be in Hawaii next week so it should be very interesting what happens.  House I'm in is a rental.  Lease is up in May. The follow you elsewhere and the fact we don't have kids or pets are the reasons for not yet moving. The synopsis for activity for us goes like this. We moved in May 1st 2012, Day one in the empty house we heard a kid cough come from upstairs. Owner had just minutes prior.  After a few weeks we began waking up finding as you mentioned all doors down stairs open. Including the front door and all kitchen cabinets. That was odd but we shrugged it off. Then it kept happening around the time the 1st plant flew and when the 1st plant rose up by the TV and did a 360 spin and keeled over. After that we knew something was up. Days later ADT came and installed the security system. We were just getting to many doors open while sleeping. activity spiked during house parties. Then the LOUD bangs began. Thunderous. Unable to locate the source. Missing items. Teleport. Finding stuff neither of us owned pretty much went from Summer to Winter of 2012.  Then in 2013 for the most part got quiet. The bangs stopped. Objects stopped flying and etc. The Bible, the 1st Bible I should say that went missing summer/fall 2012 never came back.  Then on January 2nd 2014 I took a bad mysterious fall. Tore my knee cap clean off. Patella tear. Was laid up for 2 1/2 months.  Thats when the noise and movement began. By time March rolled around on Sunday we were sleeping and was awaken to a loud BANG. We heard this bang before.  Minutes later we went back to sleep and thats when the first Amour got thrown.  This was March 2014.  After that night the activity spiked and remained spiking, escalating till February 2015. Everyday was an event.  Oh and that Bible that went missing in 2012. It came back April of 2014. Fire alarm woke us up one night while sleeping. There in the hallway was the missing Bible on fire, ablaze. This was about 1:34am.  A local Paranormal team had just left the house two hours prior. When they walked in they say our house was humming. All their equipment died.  the dangerous activity has now subsided.  No one knows for sure. Poltergeist are known for this lull.  I'm thinking with the lull the time might be ripe to finally move.  But there goes that follow me to my new home fear factor.  Question- have you and your girlfriend ever had a caught in spiders web feeling?  If so please explain? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You see that's how I'm able to determine and spot a truth person vs. a hoaxer. It takes one to know one as the saying goes. As I'm reading your words I'm linking it mentally to my experience. My GF and my own experience. And you're correct. We've been dealing with this for the last 3 years. Last year was insane.  You're right about the large objects missing. We had a 3 foot step ladder disappear and re-appear between 3-4 people. It just vanished and re-appeared. We have giant Amours tossed like confetti.

From about Oct to February of last year I was poked in my rib cage while sleeping. Like someone's fore finger was literally jabbing me. We've had bar stools thrown and knocked over. One day my GF was in my office listening to some of the sounds I caught on handicam and the stereo kept coming on and the volume put on high.  

What proceeded the bad activity was lights going off and on. Sometimes a total black out of the house, 2nd floor or the exact room I was in.  We've had fires. 2 fires in my office. 1st fire we had I called the fire dept.  Poster caught fire.  GF was at home alone one night and every light bulb in the hallway and stairway exploded. Light bulb and the porcelain case that the bulb was in. We've come homeor have been awaken in the middle of the night by that dense feeling you speak of. Its like the house is alive or is watching you. As the torment increases you both get irritable mood swings. We began questioning and fighting each other. Blaming each other and each time the activity spiked higher.

It was total catch 22 situation. House party's, levity , and fun moments activity still spiked. But when we got angry or frustrated a different sort of activity would happen.  A few paranormal teams aka thrill seekers made matters worse by what they recommended. Our local Parish(local as in the one in our suburb) dragged his feet in helping us. 

Did you ever hear the sounds of furniture being dragged around?
Did you ever see movement or shadows out the corner of your eye?


My GF hair got pulled a few times. Something would whisper to her while she slept or was napping.

I've seen a female , torso apparition 3 times
I've seen the shadowy figures about 1-2 ft tall.

When sleeping was your toes ever messed with? Like pins or needles poking you. Like a vise or needles sandwiching your feet while sleeping?

How many miles would you say you had to move before the activity subsided?

Are u and your girlfriend still together?

I know thinking and answering these questions conjures up deep, dark emotions. I feel you. We're that way now.

There's really no support system. No support group for people like us. people who lived this stuff. Friends and family those that sincerely believe you really are ill-equipped on how to assist mentally.

I'm clinging to my belief system. Thats what we got me through thus far. I'm no saint by any stretch of the imagination. But I'm no bad person either. I work a 9 to 5 and when done just want my couch or love seat and TV or Xbox.

This Poltergeist had other plans and hit us hard on day one.

<TEXT> Hello Christoforever?  I think you just became my new best friend.  I will be in contact with you soon to pick your brain for info.  Questions I have for you worth sharing here include:  Did you or your GF ever experiencing LOUD bangs, wall tapping? Objects being thrown and objects missing?  You mentioned something about the taps on the forehead while sleeping. Yikes.  Was there any other movement while sleeping like bed shakes, mattress indention's, hovering. Your case and mine mimic a lot.  http://s299.photobucket.com/user/subject1320/slideshow/  GF was scratched to. 3 times.  I know about the warm sensation feeling. I get it or use to get it on my arm and thigh. when the activity was heightened. Never any scratches on me though.  I've been pushed though </TEXT>

<TEXT> Error372 I like and appreciate your idea. Its thinking outside the box and I agree with it.  It has been attempted at least the part about the  portable power supply.  Back up battery. But please understand me when I say this. Back up batteries offer the same problem as a wall outlet, matter of fact they bring about more problems.  Their heavy, expensive --- and pose a threat as being  anew projectile object. When I had 3 hour to 4 hour length back up battery the battery would mysteriously drain, mysteriously be turned off. Remember I said I had camera watching cameras. If an entity can unplug a camera from a wall or from a AC port it can equally turn a battery off. And guess what it did. A portable battery does not eliminate the object being teleported away.

There's a saying nothing can defeat a determined mind. That proverb holds true with Poltergeists as it does with humans. A Poltergeist that doesn't want to be captured on film or digital video guess what is not going to allow itself to be captured on video. Now that doesn't make the story less true.  I can use editing and movie making software and make a  video and posted here. What then? I'm believable all of a sudden. It becomes cool then.  All of a sudden I'm believable.

I've searched online and I cannot find one Poltergeist related video where the activity that is caught is still subject to 50% believers and 50% skeptics.  Will someone please provide me a video where the consensus is 100% that the video is real. 

The evidence is not the video or the gadgets used to capture an entity writing on a wall. The evidence is witnesses, tenant statement, credibility of the one experiencing the event, the one witnessing the event and the numerous amount of people involved in the project. Would you like the previous tenant to post here?  How about BUMPS. the paranormal team that saw objects levitate themselves.  I could post there reports but guess what there reports are equally man made, equally hand written just like any video I post here.  The definition of insanity is " trying the same thing over and over again hoping for different results. Myself and those helping us thought about embedding cameras into the dry wall of the wall but that poses significant risk to house and property.  I've seen this Poltergeist throw a 300+ Amour across a room like it was paper. If I leave a camera embedded in my wall while I'm at work for 8 hrs.  The only thing I'm going to come home to is the same thing we came home to last year except now I got  a huge hole in my wall and for what. To satisfy skeptics and scenics online who are in no position to help or offer substantial advice. I'm not even seeking advice. Everything I'm reporting happened last year. I'm just recounting events we experienced last year and sharing it.  People can believe or not believe.   I like your advice. Its been tried and the results have been the same.   The best thing a skeptic can do is take my account and compare it to previous Poltergeist related events in the past and look for similarities.  Trust me you'll find plenty. That's the best advice I can offer a skeptic. I don't even want to waste my time on scenic's.   Scenic(s) are just here to run interference on topics worthy of being advanced. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Poltergeist - Snow and Wall Markings </TITLE>

<TEXT> 

Two things was interesting and memorable about Thanksgiving Day 2014. It had snowed the days leading up to Thanksgiving. Snow was still on the ground the day of. Thats  Memory  #1.  Memory #2 was my girlfriends son coming to pick up some Thanksgiving plates for himself and friends.  Nothing unusual there right?  After hugs to me and his mom  he departs.  He's grown - never has lived with us.  Minutes later there's a knock on our door and its him again.  In a chuckled voice he asks me "Dude what's this writing on your lawn?"    And thats where this story will begin.


I walk outside our house its after 9pm Thanksgiving Day and say "what do you mean writing on the lawn?"  He ushers me further outside and on the front lawn there  written in the snow are words that look like "D %ck".  Snow had been on the ground and was beginning to melt but its nightfall and the temp drops so the melted snow is frozen. The letters themselves has begun to melt but it looks like there are two lines. Line 1 carved into the snow says what looks like "D--ck"  the second word on line two underneath is unreadable.  We both look at the word and my GF son chuckles and says it looks like someone wrote on your lawn the word "D* ck"   The second word beings with a K and the rest of the lawn underneath is snowless. The snow has melted on that patch area.

We look at it for about 3 minutes. Its cold outside.  He laughs, young kid, his friends are honking the car for him to come on as we're departing we both agree this must be some weird prank because it looks like what's carved in the snow is the word "D* ck" and something else.  I assume most of you know how writing looks carved in the snow after its been there awhile. By awhile I mean a day or two.  The letter size gets wider and less readable due to the fluctuation of the temperature. Yes we had snow on the ground days prior to Thanksgiving. But by day time the temperature was low 40's. In the shade mid 30's.  The writing looked like it has been there for awhile. A  day or two.  Our thought at that time was there must have been some teenagers in the neighborhood who while walking by decided to write in the snow.  Thats the conclusion I left with.   Keep in mind inside the house from 2012 to at that time Thanksgiving 2014 crazy stuff had been happening inside the house.  Even with the unlimited amount of activity for the past 2 years - I walked away from my GF's son pointing out to us we had writings on our lawn thinking this was some neighborhood prank. Bigger fish to fry inside the house than worry about some group of kids getting kicks out writing "d ^ck" and etc in the snow outside my door.  I would monitor it mentally but thats about it. NOTE  TO SELF.

Thats November. Few days after Thanksgiving the snow melts.  Writings gone.

Two weeks after Thanksgiving comes my bday. I have a Bday party at my house. 12 of my closest friends come over.   Yes we did have activity. Tina's notebook which we didnt even know was missing materializes in the middle of the floor between 3 of my friends while THEY WERE doing Karaoke. Various alcoholic beverages, one being Pacifico beer. The guys and I go through  3 cases. Good Times. The day after the bday is cleanup day - the story of the bottle hitting the wall and noise arriving first and the bottle appearing minutes later was during that time frame.  The Monday after my bday party I wake up and discover the wallet I keep in my safe for fear of it going missing is in fact missing. Safe sits in my office. Combo safe. Only I know the combo. GF leaves for work before me that day. I get up, shower and dress and go to my office to grab my car keys(my remaining set) and grab my wallet. Car keys are in the safe. My wallet is gone.  Once again after about 100+ missing items you dont really go around looking for stuff esp. when you know you purposely put something in the safe to prevent it from going missing in the first place.  My wallet is done. I have a business trip to  in a few days and I now have no ID, no credit cards.  I call my job and tell them I wont be in today - I'm working from home.  After that I call and tell my GF what's going on. After that I grab my birth certificate and head to the Drivers License office to get a new drivers license.  

An hour later I return home with my temporary drivers license. I do a quick look over the house and head back out. Now its time to go to the bank and get more bank cards, cancel the existing, etc.  I even run to the Mall to grab a new wallet. Blah Blah Blah right.  Are you  seeing better yet feeling the inconvenience all of this is doing?  For those who know Poltergeists, Demons and Malevolent entity's.   The entity behind all of this is watching EVERYTHING.  Thats why IT did it. 

I return home about an hour and half later from mall and bank and this video below is what I find in my office.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3meCW-YznM

I could've been gone for no more than 2 hours. Maybe even less than that.  The writing here or the material used to produce it is different. Its more runny. More oily.  Patches of it are still wet. I attribute that to me just being gone for less than 2 hrs.  As well as it being Winter vs. Summer. We own nothing even close to this inside our house.  Three things you need to know when watching the above video.  The cross hanging on the wall above the TV.  That cross hangs in the living room kitchen area. Was in the living room before I left.  Its nailed unto the wall with the all too familiar Upside Down Man(Native American symbol) which means "a man has died" based on Google searched.  Directly across from cross is a pair of scissors - stuck into the wall.  Thats been done before remember this video? See where the scissors is placed?  Dead center of the "Upside Down Man's" head.  The 3rd thing I want you to notice is the bar stool. That's the kitchen bar stool. Like the cross on the wall above the TV it too has been in the office before. But study the direction of the bar stool.   If you look at all the videos of when a chair was moved be it down stairs or upstairs. Once again check the videos and compare. You will see minus of how many chairs are re-located. One chair is always purposely turned to face towards a TV: office living room TV.  

Now I can't explain that. I'm clueless as to why is that. But it means something. We might not ever know. But the chair facing the TV, or facing one of the "Upside Down Man" markings is not a coincidental.  I pray to God and his Christ Jesus that someday, one day someone seeing this will be able to put two and two together. There are other things in this room out of order or in order "Order in Chaos" I should say.  But lets move the story forward because it goes south from here.

The Upside down man and cross stuff are not new.  What's new here are my initials KL with the word "Die" in front of it. A milestone in my house  is a new event, often a similar event with something new added.  This house, this office has had similar events like this before. What's new are the words "Die KL". That's a mile-stone i.e.  call-out. Does not take a rocket scientist to look at this and realize this alone speaks volumes.   People can debate what constitutes a "Residual Haunting" and what constitutes an "Intelligent Haunting" all day.  This mile-stone as it exist right now has for me based on what I read about both "residual" and "intelligent" constitutes an Intelligent Haunting.  This is another feather in the cap of what ever living in this house being a Poltergeist.  Dont get me wrong Demons have the power if not more to the very same thing.  But in doing the Paranormal community a favor I'm going to lean towards Poltergeist. I'm in agreement with you. This is a Poltergeist. This true account alone should be a Parapsychologists wet-dream.  But I digress. Back to the story like I said it goes down hill from here.  Now every mile-stone in this house always signifies the activity is about to raise things up a notch or two. Thats been the pattern with the missing Bibles, burnt posters, objects being thrown, objects disappearing, and etc.   Other house attacks, aka Poltergeist vandalisms have happened when GF and I were at work. House is secure. No forced entry. ADT is armed.  Locks changed 2-3 times since living here. Police and crime reports show no other related activity within the 2-3 counties next to us.  All attacks have been in day light hours. This happened in less than 2 hours.  The entity knows I'm returning home and  soon. No one's coming in doing this?  No one outside person or group of people can predict Keith lost his wallet today. Keith's not going into the office today. Keith's going to leave and be back at a certain time. He's gone lets break in, paint and all and go to work on the furthest room in the house, a room upstairs mind you. Vandalize it and take nothing else in the process. Leave no paint residue anywhere in the room. No spilt paint on office furniture, carpet, wall etc. everywhere the paint is are the words "Die KL" "Upside Down Man" " Paw prints" 3, "Cross" and etc. No blobs or etc. anywhere that would indicate who ever did this was rushing to get it done or more or less was amateur.  I welcome that debate with anyone. 

This was a few days after my bday.   Two weeks after Thanksgiving.  Please re-read paragraph 1   2.  You have a luxury even I at the time did not have.  Now lets talk about Christmas.

Christmas afternoon. We return home from a celebration with friends.  About two hours later I'm in my office.  Its late in the day.  Nothing usual. I stepped out of my office and this video is what I find.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX5PKCPhsck

I'm not going to go deep into the events of the video above accept to say. This is a Christian prayer card and Native American necklace my co-worker bought me when he went on vacation to Arizona. Like I said before friends, family, paranormal teams and co-workers know of our ordeal and they all believe us. My co-worker bought two necklaces when he ventured into a Indian Reservation shop as a mean of protection. A necklace for me and one for my GF. This necklace now broken was mine.  The card where you see the familiar "Die KL" remember the  "Die Kl" from the video above? Now its "Die KL" on a Christian prayer card. I got this card a few weeks ago. I was in a Christian store buying new wooden crosses you see them upside down in the previous video-(all are now missing BTW).  I went to this store to buy more crosses and Christian symbols.  As I'm standing in the check-out line the lady behind me pokes me and hands me this card. She says something to the effect "Sir you should have this. You need this." She's about 80+ yrs. old. I smile and read the card and knowing 200% that I probably do need this kindly accept. Now this card being a gift was kept in my office on my computer desk under my monitor.  I will admit I forgot what it said because after the "Die KL" was written on it my GF being in tears upon reading it threw it away.  

Now if you look at the video and pic you can see the words "Die KL"   those are my initials. The web substance does resemble the web substance on the 1st video. Its very sticky, but not adhesive. Its wetter than wet if that makes since.   This is Christmas Day. I'm still not connecting the dots.  Until

Few days later a new snow comes in. It snows for a day or two and the first night of the night I leave my house to retrieve something on in my car. My car is parked curb side. I have to pass a majority of my lawn to get to the car. Since its icy outside I avoid walking on the pavement and instead choose to walk on the grass.  Thats where I see the new writing.  There which much better snow. New snow. 1st night of snow are the words "Die KL" Once again its two lines. Just like the office and hallway (card pic) "Die KL"

Now we can return back to Thanksgiving 2014 where all of this really began. It began with my girlfriends(GF) son knocking on our door after 1st leaving with plates of food for himself and his friends.  He knocks on the door to tell us on our lawn is the some writing we both at the time thought was the word "D* k"  It was not the word "D ^ck". It was "Die KL".  It was just un-readable due to the snow melting.  Just like the "Die KL on the card which if you look carefully is almost un-readable to.  

Now I'm sorry, truly sorry I didnt get a picture of that.  In my defense I didnt have my cell phone with me.  But thats a weak excuse I could've easily grabbed it. But me going back inside to retrieve my camera or cell phone would have caught the attention of my girlfriend.  Seeing "Die KL" in both office and hallway is one thing. That plus the other events and I'm leaving a lot out trust me.  Between each "Die KL" are days/nights of flying candles. Flying vases. Lights going off and on and worse.  I see the "Die KL" on my front lawn and thinking some neighbor walking their dog is going to see this because at this stage every other house knows our house is haunted.  That secret got revealed the day the 1st paranormal team came and with them came their logo and paranormal van with the name "No Bull Paranormal" on the side of van.  People know. In the snow are the words "Die KL". I take my foot and remove it.  It never snowed the winter of 2014 after that night. But the "Die KL" would appear one more time.  The last time being inside my car.

Like most boyfriends if your GF asked you to go to the store for a cooking ingredient you opt to go. This weekend would be no different.  My GF asks me to go the store for OJ. I grab my keys, and throw on some sweats. I'm out the door in minutes. Using my key-fob I unlock the car as I'm heading to it.  When I get in my car. My Hyundai silver blue Sonata - 2008. I sit in the drivers seat and the words "Die KL" is written on both floor of the car. Driver and Passenger. Written on the seats are "Upside Down Man" and "Upside Down Cross" On the ceiling is "Die KL".  Same oily, gluey,, non adhesive substance. But its still wet and thats mostly due to the temperature and humidity outside.  Once again same oily substance as what was in the house. And what was in the hallway.  No excuse for not taking a picture. But once again my biggest fear and level of panic attack was neighbors walking by and seeing the words "Die KL" or better yet see me cleaning the words "Die KL" off the inside of my car upholstery.  Instead of pic taking I pop open the garage door and back the car inside and immediately grab what ever cleaning ingredient is inside the garage (not much). Couldnt go into the house seeking cleaning stuff. Once again GF would be like why are u looking for cleaning stuff and its 9am or so in the morning, when you're suppose to be going to the store.  Grabbing cleaning gear from inside would just beg the question.  I find a towel and use the outside water faucet and some Windex I found in the garage and remove the markings.   Its the scene from "Pulp Fiction" all over again where Jackson and Travolta are forced to scrub brain matter off the innards of their car before Quintin Tarintinos character wife returns home.

Conclusion:
This was an emotional story to recount. Number one just reliving it, and recounting it in one's own brain is hard to do. These events happened over a year ago.  Thats not easy to do ladies and gentlemen. Dates, and times therein get blurred and the more distance between then and now stuff gets forgotten. When stuff gets forgotten thats where certain individuals leap in and try to poke holes in hopes of calling out inconsistencies.  Its also emotional because up until  now most of the activity in the home centered around the home. Meaning GF and I shared in a majority of the events that took place.  We saw it together.   After the "Die KL" episodes events begin to happen more with just me in the house.   All vases being thrown are on my side of the bed. GF leaves for work and its just me there. Objects get thrown at me while in the shower. Lights go off with just me in the house. Objects get thrown at me while I'm on sitting on the toilet.  I'm in the bathroom and GF is gone. Something walks by turns off the light manually and slams the door shut.  GF is at work. We live alone. Wallet gets taken again in January.  Candles get thrown outside my office.  Im sleeping and something is poking my rib cage. Poking from inside the pillow while I sleep. I wake up and look at my Gf she's sound asleep. As I mentioned before each NEW event is a mile-stone.   Weeks prior to the 1st "Die K:" which was Thanksgiving Day 2014, there might have been more. We just don't know. There are questionable stuff that happened weeks and months before that were weird that I ignored that we ignored that might be in fact Poltergeist related activity. I've gone into grocery stores and come back out and all my car doors are wide - open.  Your in the middle of Safeway parking lot and you walk outside, patrons and employees are standing next to your car scratching their heads, trying to alert you(me) that all your car doors are open.   My neighbors have rung our door bell 4am, 5am on a weekday to inform me that all my car-doors are open. Thats happened 3 times. Nothings ever taking. Nothings missing. Nothings sabotaged. Or is it? Your going 60 mph on the Hwy. Is the entity with you?  Is it going to jerk the steering wheel while you're driving? What does "Die KL" mean?  Is it Omen. These question rule your mind.  You become isolated mentally from your own partner because now you're witnessing and experiencing events she's not privy to. And when you try to fill her in or when there's spillage to where she does see some of it. She erupts into tears of her own. And guess who's sitting on a wall like spider-man benefiting?  

When the "Die KL" started appearing that's when I started putting 2 and 2 together.  Once we discovered the "Die KL" in the office and room more activity began to happen towards me vs. towards the house vs. towards my GF.  To this day my GF still doesn't know about the "Die KL" inside the car.  I think I finally clued her in on the "Die KL" on the lawn. Only because every now and then her son brings it up.  That cross you saw stabled on the wall?  Its missing. Its gone. Those religious objects you saw underneath the HD TV. There gone. That Big Black cross?  Thats the same cross my cousin gave me. The same cross that went missing for a week and returned in the washing machine while it was running- the weekend Capt. America came out.


Now I want to be clear about something before I close this story out. This true story out.  The entity be it a Poltergeist or Demon. I think we all can agree its malevolent.  And I believe its a Poltergeist. A Poltergeist thats tied to the land or building.  The reason why this malevolent entity does these things is to raise anxiety within the house. More importantly to raise anxiety between the house occupants.  Be it fear or anxiety both when raised provide fuel for the entity.  I'm not sharing the fact that this entity wrote "Die KL", or drew an "Upside Down Man" symbol, or took every cross in our house and put them upside down in key spots to make you think this all too Hollywoodesque to be true.  The entity goes through great lengths to make it too fantastic to create skeptics and doubters.  I smirk when people say something this active should be able to be captured on Video.  Videos can be faked just as easily as a video can be doctored. $99 worth of software can do the trick. A extreme level of intelligence, consciousness, and mischief making is at play here. Calculative on steroids is at play here.  It is true. All of it and more did happen. Its not happening now. Lets be clear. Its not happening now. But for about 8 months it happened everyday.  EVERYDAY. I'm not trying to  paint you an Apocalyptic picture. The picture I'm trying to paint is these things live and prey off fear and ignorance.  If I had less wits than I have now I'd be peeing my paints and loosing it. Doesn't make me special. Doesn't make my girlfriend special. It just makes us grounded.  They live off fear and ignorance.   The ignorance portion I want to talk about 1st because the more ignorance you have about these things the more level of fear you will develop. The entity knows this. Matter of fact its counting on it.

To most people an upside cross, burnt Bible, burnt cross is terrifying. And thats understandable. It to a degree it is. It's terrifying to us.  You try taking a shower and all of a sudden all the house alarms go off. You run to figure out whats going and something BIG, with mass, with density and gravity attached it runs right pass you - as it to suggest how little consequence you are to it.  Its invisible. You see a silhouette and outline or nothing but then again you feel the wind zip past you based on how fast its running by you.   Are you grasping the picture I'm trying to paint for you? But as equal as its terrifying the thing you have to do immediately when this happens is immediately put it in perspective.  Ask yourself why is it terrifying?  Its terrifying because Hollywood, Books, TV and movies therein and to some degree organized religion sells it as  terrifying.   More people are fearful of the water due the movie Jaws, more afraid of Sharks due a blockbuster summer movie that came out in the 70's. The shark that appeared 20 minutes at the end of the movie is ingrained in our psyche some 40+ years later.  The entity knows this. And by IT knowing this, our weakness we developed ever since man left the cave and began walking on two legs vs. all fours.  The fear of the unknown governs us.  The unknown or the fear of is at the root of most decisions being made. Usually the incorrect ones.  I've made mistakes living in this house. My GF has to. To error is human. But lets be honest if this thing wanted to kill us it could've killed us in our sleep.  It can't kill you.  It can make you fearful enough to make you kill yourself or your partner next to you.  It can make you suicidal. But its not creating those things. Those failures already exist for the entity to exploit.  If failings exists it will exploit and it will try to use it to raise the level of fear.  We're not special people (GF and I).  This has been scary, haunting and terrifying at times.  But the ignorance or the decisions, and loss of sleep we make due to ignorance is the realm of where these things thrive.  Seeing "Die Kl" or an Upside Down Man which means "a man has died, or means death" or better yet a burnt Bible or burnt cross while troubling, more so compelling than troubling  does not make me roll up into the fetal position.  If you're not rooted in truth but more so rooted in folk lore then yeah these  events will get the best of you.  Thats my reason for sharing this story. 

Regards

sorry for the length. No way to cut this story down to size that expanded 3-4 weeks.

<TEXT> I think people are suspicious in general quick to call out hoax and fraud when the information the see and read doesn't fill in the blanks for them. Evidence is a relative term.  Shown to 5 people you get 10 different interpretations. I posted youtube vids(exploit the channel) i posted the photobucket with 300+ photos: previous house occupiers testimony, pic of the female apparition, reports and notes from the paranormal teams investigating the house. I don't know what else to do. I will share my true account. My GF true account when the motivation and free time hits me.  As we use to say back in the day you can either take it or let it alone.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like your observation to detail. These are questions worth asking because it allows me to expand on things we've seen.  Yes the images I drew are the creatures I call minions. When the activity was at it highest Oct-Feb 2014/15 those shadows would be seen out of the corner of my eye or in dark corners of the house.  They love hanging around the foot of the bed, arms of couches and love seats and under tables. They are very low laying and cling to the outer perimeters of the room.  Its my opinion based on experience that these  1-2 ft beings appear when a house is highly troubled, highly stressed and highly active with Poltergeist activity. They could've been spirits summoned by the former Native American people when this land was in turmoil with the US settlers.  They might be remnants from that era. Current situation is the dangerous activity has subsided. The Episcopal church performed a House Cleansing July 11th of last year - activity was subsiding at that point. Whats left now are the knocking, occasional Rapping sound, thud foot steps and poking and prodding while sleeping. Last week my garage door rose and let itself down by itself.  Paranormal teams off the east coast, CA and the UK are monitoring the house collecting new data. The things that's constant 24/7 are the wall taps, ceiling movement and pops and pings.  Through study we think we might able to get rid of it.  Maybe.  If its tied to the land this 10 year old house might always have some sort of activity. Great questions. Thanks for understanding and for allowing me to share. Need more info let me know. I have more to share but its hard determining whats of value. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe it was or maybe it was rebooting doing a reconfig from a power loss. Obviously if I'm standing right about the cam I'm not doing the remote control of it.  But as I said before we bought cameras into the picture to try to catch the very thing you all question and seek i.e. evidence that increased the level of activity which included: cameras going missing, cameras being unplugged, cameras being thrown or destroyed or the electricity to the room or outlet the camera was in being cut. Those are the facts I'm putting forth.  Electricians have been to the house many times. There is nothing wrong with outlet or the wires behind the wall. No other electrical device has had problems when plugged in those same outlets.  That's my true story.  Whether you find that believable or plausible is TBD. </TEXT>

I was in my office on my PC and my back is turned to the TV and portion of the room the bottle came flying in.  I saw movement out the corner of my eye and heard a sound.  Like I said sometimes you hear the sound and even see something zoom by out the corner of your eye and hear the crash but the object is no nowhere to be found until minutes later.  This has happened more than once. Last time being Dec 2014. So yes in 2012, and 2014 objects flew forcefully in our house, Another indication of a Poltergeist.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMflNdqHayo </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is the link to http://s299.photobucket.com/user/subject1320/slideshow/Stafford%20Way  When u execute the slide view remember you're looking at pics from 2015 to 2012. The slide show moves backwards in time not forwards.  And you're correct the only thing proof or evidence provided here does is start flame wars and activate the trolls.  I mean are the one's really requesting evidence deeply involved in paranormal research or do they just want to be judge and jury as to whats real? I have 0 time for them.  The reason why "WE" think its a Poltergeist is a cumulative facts gathered and patterns. I think we all can agree that its an angry spirit.   The Rappings, other taps, items missing, objects being thrown, wall markings, and electrical stuff.  Interviews with previous tenants who speak of similar stuff make a Poltergeist the likely culprit.  You're correct about both a highly emotional person and a collection of random negative energy that sort of becomes the entity. The later is the theory we believe most to be true. Based on what we know about the land underneath the house. The Native American history.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammamish_people  and http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20141219_112235347_HDR.jpg </TEXT>

<TEXT> You hear the sounds first and the markings sometimes come later.

The bangs known as Rapping began occurring in summer/fall 2012. Pretty much the same time every night once the 1st one began. After a few weeks they'd even begin in the morning esp the weekends. Often waking us up.  This story below is  different: the experience is a little different. There are 3 types of noises we would hear 1. The banging known as Rapping( I later discovered that terminology) 2. Thuds - foot steps pacing back in forth. I'm a big guy. 6"5 1/2 250 lbs.  The thuds were louder than mine. We'd hear the thuds late night, early morning-hallway, bedrooms. Constant pacing. And 3) Loud wall taps. Different than the rapping sounds. Whats interesting about #1 and #3 phenomena is you can't trace the sound. You hear it but its hard to tell where its coming from directly.

One Saturday morning my girlfriend and I were trying to sleep in(sleep past 10am) House was active with sounds and movement.  Around 8am or 9am a series of wall tapping begin. They were loud and they felt like they were one room over.  They came in sets. TAP TAP TAP ( very loud)  Pause  TAP TAP TAP (Pause). One second they seemed far away. Other second they seemed real close. Finally enough was enough we got up and began our day. 

After an hour of being awake and in respective parts of the house. My GF call's me into the master bedroom. Mind you the noises stopped after we got up.

I walked into the bedroom and on my girlfriends side of the bed are the marks below.

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140810_125338731.jpg

Now next to her bed and mine are night stands aka lamp stands etc. Its about a foot or less between the stands and our bed. I'm going to out on a limb and say those dents in the wall were not there before we went to bed. There very noticeable.  I believe almost 100% those dents were not there when we woke up.  We were hearing sounds yes. Loud sounds. Some felt close some felt very far. None felt like they were just inches from our bedside. No way we would've slept or stayed in bed that long.  

And the noises did stop when we got up.  I didnt know then but I know now because similar phenomena has happened since then.

That phenomena being we often would hear loud noises. Crashing sounds be it glass, pottery, objects thrown, furniture being drugged around, chains, etc and minutes later an object would appear broken or destroyed. An object sort of matching the sound we heard.

True Exampe.  I've been in my office and something out of the corner zips pass my eye and then there's a crash. I follow the direction of the glimpse and there on the wall is a new hole.  But where is the object that caused the hole?  GF and I look to and fro in the office a confined space mind you. Nothing out of the ordinary. We heard the crash. I saw what appeared to be an object zooming past. It impacted the wall. We search the office tooth and nail. Minutes later after giving up our search and resuming normal activity - the object appears. In a spot, plain sight. No way we could've missed. Its in a logical spot. There on the floor is a broken beer bottle or candle.  The nose of the beer bottle matches the dent in the wall. Matter of fact the residue from the wall is on the nose of the beer bottle.

Pics#1 is the  LOUD Tapping. 
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140810_125338731.jpg

Pic #2 is the dent in the wall. Office wall Dec 2014 where the bottle that caused it appeared many minutes later.  I saw it travel out the corner of my eye. But couldn't account for where it landed. The dent and noise were immediate.

Hole caused by flying beer bottle. Bottle appeared minutes later.

<TEXT> I have provided a photobucket slide view of 300+ photos. In it includes the apparition itself, the paranormal teams involved, more Poltergeist fallout, and the statement of several previous tenants that lived in the house before us. If people are two lazy to go through that full album themselves then I dont know what else to say. I'm not out to prove anything. That effort is fruitless and brings little reward as most here are not in the position to help and help is not needed.  The activity has ceased for the most part. I'm just sharing accounts from 2012 up until now.  Trying to stay in the order of how the events un-folded.  "Show me the proof doesn't interests me." Sharing a true story does.

<TEXT> I sincerely think you hope that. At least with me. I've noticed with some who read, or hear this story. Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction and this story if true brings up reality some people are not ready to face.  I wake up some days and I'm not ready to face it.  You're scared I get it.  You're thinking if what this guy is saying is true there where does that leave my belief system? Where does that leave God, Satan, religion, Ghosts, UFO's, Quantum Theory, History or the Universe, heck the history of man, etc.  What kind of person does that make me if what he is saying is true. Its a big burden to bear not knowing the unknown.  Where one fits in it all and should a person come wandering through with a story so surreal, so eerie that it must be a hoax. It has to be a hoax.  The world is full of people like you.  That's called denial. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just looked at the DropCam you recommended. They are nice cameras. Not cost effective with a Poltergeist stealing and smashing things.  One factor I had to analyze and weigh before buying a camera was cost factor, setup and ramp up time, windows and phone app friendly and again cost factor.  Foscams go for $30 - $50 bucks tops on Amazon. Even less on Craigslist. It was not my 1st choice but due to cameras being stolen, destroyed and messed with the foscam makes it economical.  But I will keep my eye on the DropCam. They look good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good question. i can honestly say the cameras moving by themselves are not the only things ever manipulated.  We've had TV's come on by themselves. TV's turn off by themselves. Channels change by themselves and TV's play by themselves with the TV being unplugged. That's not made up. That's 100% truth.  That same camera does the same movement after a reboot. so maybe the outlet it was plugged in lost power?  Thats happened to. Power has been lost to one room. One section of the house and one outlet off and on at times. Electricians, cable and phone companies come in and find nothing.................wrong.   That's all I'm saying.  Add this to objects being thrown, objects missing, writings, knocking, bangs, and tapping its text book Poltergeists.  We didn't come to that conclusion on day 1. ironically it took 2 yrs to reach that belief.  That belief came from more seasoned paranormal teams investigating the house.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, markings in the office were drawn by the Poltergeist.  We didn't do this. And the house is well secure from the outside. All locks have been changed twice after moving in. You can see from the time line how soon we bought ADT in to secure the house. That was 2012.  The writing and scratches on the wall came immediately after we started putting up Christian themes and cameras.  Obviously from an IT point of a view the office became the command center for me trying to capture evidence and activity so the office became instantly the most active room in the house </TEXT>

The only reason I'm here is because researching led me here.  Yeah when the entity first drew the upside cross yeah my GF and I panicked. Who wouldn't?  But knowledge is power. So i went online and learned that a upside cross drawn by an entity could be a form of trickery. It wants us to think its a demon. It wants us to go down the wrong path of figuring it out. The more mistakes we make the stronger it gets.  The fact that it not me drew an upside down cross doesn't make the story less real. In truth it speaks volumes as to how real it really is. </TEXT>

Like I said it destroyed my cameras and I went out and bought more cameras. It trashed my office setting me back a few days and I began to curse out loud and leave it little notes. All in all this makes the entity stronger and lash out more. Whats scary is when it lashes out when you're trying to sleep. </TEXT>

You're dealing with an intelligent entity that quite possibly is ages old.  It's obvious it's trying to use Christian lore, urban legend and cheap tricks to scare. Poltergeist feed on fear.

<TEXT> I don't fault individuals who ask where are the cameras. Where is the footage of all this activity?  Those are good questions. I suffered the same paradigm many of you suffer thinking cameras are going to work. Cameras are going to catch the ghost red handed. I was thinking the same thing. So when I went online and bought multiple cameras. But what you're going to find out hopefully from seeing the links below. Me buying cameras and digicams made the matter worse. Some even think I was playing into the Poltergeists hands.  View each link and read the foot note underneath.

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140701_215834170.jpg
this is my office. After cameras were installed the office became the most active room in the house. This room had 2 cameras in it. You can see one camera still on facing the doorway.  The upside down cross on written on the carpet the entity drew not me. A second camera is missing. The printer that you cant see in this shot has 4 blank pages in it.  Which means the house or the room itself lost power.  each camera emails me when motion, or sound is detected. By the time I log into to view in real-time, the camera is offline. When they come back online the room is trashed. GF and I are at work.  ADT security alarm system is on not-tripped.
(That chair facing the TV BTW belongs in the kitchen FYI.)

there use to be a camera siting on that table. Camera is gone. See the wiring? Couch is pushed backwards. One time the couch was upside down. Same story. Not at home.

One camera out of eight that were mounted in the home. 24/7, motion and sound detect. That camera got unplugged, thrown around, went missing, returned and finally went missing . Its still missing.

Same room the wall mounted camera was in. Master bedroom. See the book on the floor? Mom gave it to me to help deal with our problem. 

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140630_180323532_1.jpg
same masterbedroom. Different angle. Once again when cameras came into the picture. Activity spiked. 

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140729_221659152.jpg
Here's a good picture. The hallway. 2nd most active room in the house. You can see the camera on the floor. Everything you see sitting on the floor wasnt there originally. They were on the hall book shelf. Bible thrown down. Sage ash tray thrown down. Prayer documents thrown down. Clock thrown down. Camera thrown down. Bible is now missing. Camera is missing. Prayer documents missing. Sage tray missing. Clock missing. That step ladder. I'll tell u about the step ladder once I get into the paranormal teams coming to my house. But its been thrown a few times.

Some where underneath all that mess is two destroyed cameras. One you can see sitting on the rubble. 

Now for the video where the entity is manipulating the cameras.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsGic0oG7qk
We're asleep. This camera sits above the fire place in the living. Same living room above. If you look closely you can see a light not too far. That light is another camera in the kitchen.

We did lucky a few times.
This camera did catch the entity banging the door. We're asleep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsGic0oG7qk   Best with head phones as the bang is loud. The door does move inward. But as you can see no one is there.  

these videos are my first attempt of trying to capture whats going on.  I have the camera positioned in the hallway because previous nights that ironing board and can starch go flying. Instead the video cam captures the lights going off and on.  Summer/Fall 2012
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE-BpTve31E

and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcAeKqGDlLc

Once again we tried video cams, we tried cell phones, we tried motion cams, and we tried hidden cams.  1st stage the camera was un-plugged, thats the Poltergeists warning shot. It gives one per camera.  When I plugged the cameras back in-the next day that cam was either gone or destroyed. As a parting gift the room the camera was in was turned upside down.  Like an idiot I bought more cams. Putting cams next to cams. Putting cams in vents, cabinets, in the foliage and etc. Doesn't matter. A Poltergeist can see through all of that. A demon especially.  Thats what I mean by our paradigm i.e. way of thinking. Its not these things sleep or are hidden and dont see when i walk in the house and begin installing cameras. Its proof of power is having the ability to just cut the power to the room the cam was in or to the house period minutes before activity broke out.

But I did get lucky a few times. And get some footage. Not the Holy Grail , but non-the-less footage.  Its not a kid breaking into the house. Its not my GF. Its not either of us sleep walking.  Its real and its its happening in more homes throughout the world everyday. Im just trying to come forth to share and provide what little info and experience I have with the hopes of bumping into others who experienced the same thing for the benefit of note taking.

More to come.

I'm sharing

The only cool component to it all is watching the laws of physics get broken right before your very eyes.  Outside of that its pure hell in all sense of the word. People in the business of helping you say they want the Holy Grail before they get involved. The church takes its phone off the hook and wont move a muscle.  Friends and family say move, which seems logical accept for the fact what if it follows us.  This is a new house. We are new occupants living here. I can't fault the entity too much for doing what it does. Its a demon, Poltergeist or angry spirit. Its destined to do this stuff. I fault the human beings who ignore us and resemble some of these same skeptics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Instead of being accusatory why don't you ask a question.  I promise you you'll like my answer better.  These boards are so clitche.  People are more interested in being right vs listening, reading and asking good questions.  Ive been dealing with this for 3 years and of course I got video and pictures.  But I'm trying to tell the story, re-live the account in a chronological order. You skeptics want the 2nd and 3rd truthful Act before the 1st Act is finished?  Is this how you act during a movie.  1,2,3,4, now with that out of the way....allow me to answer.  The events I shared and more lasted 4-5 months before cameras were bought in. 1st camera was a video camera.  It went missing. So I bought more cameras. Foscam IR/WIFI motion detect cameras - bought about 8 of them. Once those cameras got installed that's when the fun began. I would soon find these cameras unplugged or sitting upside down.  Naturally if they're unplugged I plugged them back in. GF wasn't unplugging the cameras-it became comical because soon I began buying cameras to watch the cameras. At this stage the Poltergeists has me chasing my tail.  Finally the cameras started coming up missing. If they weren't missing they were destroyed.

And by destroyed I mean just that destroyed. Broken, crushed, thrown up against a wall. Lenses and AC Adapter wiring ripped out. Like an idiot i simply bought more cameras. Amazon and Craigslist became my best friend. After that the entity started cutting the power to the room the camera was in.  I lucked up a few times and did get a little footage. But the footage I got is like 2% to the amount of time, energy, and money put behind each camera.

In the dead of night the camera moves. Freaks out on its own 5:40 thru 7:15( about a 2 min weird session ) I've already gone to bed. May 2014. Late at night. We're asleep. Cameras tripping.

Now should I continue the story in the order of events happening or jump around all over the place making the true story more confusing? </TEXT>

Its so ironic that in a paranormal community that prides itself on believing in the unseen can at times resort to childish acts. I'm not deterred. If this entity cant run me out of my own house - then neither can total strangers online.  Most of what I'm sharing is past tense. Happened in 2012, 2014.

<TEXT> If there's one thing I could compare a haunting to, a malevolent haunting at that. A Poltergeist haunting. It would have to be the analogy of a plane coasting to the run way. That's how I would describe the actions of this story. Things happen very slow and then one day, all of sudden its suddenly all around you.  The first ignored signs were ( and I say ignored because ) early we're non-the-wiser about the subtle things happening around us. By subtle I mean on day one upon moving in we began to notice weird things. I mean we'd see something. Hear something and shrug it off. Going about our normal business within the new home we just bought.  What were some of the subtle things?  Subtle things like faint tapping sounds. Faint thuds. Faint movement that sounds like its coming from inside the wall. Leaving a room with the light on only to come back with the light off.  First few times you sort of scratch head asking yourself "why would I turn the light if I was coming back?"  After all I just went down stairs for a water refill.  Other subtle things include coming down stairs and finding a closet door open. Weird right?  Not really maybe my girlfriend left it open.  That happens for a few weeks and once again we keep shrugging it off.  Besides those subtle things I just mentioned you also start noticing items are coming up missing. Nothing earth shattering. my favorite coffee cup is gone. My GF hates coffee and no one else lives with us. Why is my coffee cup missing? A 30 minute search for it becomes pointless. No coffee cup anywhere. Then you begin to notice other things in and around are missing. Moved in the house with 20+ spoons and forks and now we have 5. Once again its only us living here and all of this within 4-6 weeks. Where is all the silverware.  You begin to question each other. Girlfriend accuses me of throwing away expensive silverware. I begin accusing her of loosing my coffee cup. Neither one of us has proof the other one is doing it.  But we deduce these events down to one another. After all no one else lives here.  In going back to the plane metaphor. At this stage the plane is now left the hanger proceeding backwards, about to do a turn around and head for the runway . Steady as she goes right?  We're still in the subtle phase. Finally you're in your bed sleeping. Its been a busy day. A busy week even and you and your girlfriend are pillow talking and while you're talking you think you hear tapping sounds.  You put your hand on your girlfriends shoulder and say "Sssssh, I heard something."  We both pause and wait. Nothing.  Minutes later we resume talking and minutes after that the faint tapping begins.  I hear it but I'm not ready to tell my girlfriend because I'm thinking maybe I'm just imagining things. Then all of a sudden she asks me "do I hear something?"  And I say "yes, you hear it" BUT soon as we both acknowledge it the noise stops.  Some nights it resumes. Other night it doesn't especially after we begin talking about it.  That happens for a few nights in addition to the other stuff mind you till one night before going to bed my girlfriend and I are both in the bedroom prepping for bed.  I'm sitting at the foot of the bed taking my socks off and etc. Girlfriends in the bathroom doing what girls do before jumping into bed. As she's walking out of the bathroom I'm about to lay in the bed when all of a sudden we hear the sound of doors closing.  There are four bedrooms upstairs. We occupy one of them. And out of the blue we hear the sound of three doors closing. Its almost as if someone is in the hallway going from room to room closing each door.  All 3 doors are within a few feet of each other.  I get up to look and see and all the doors are closed. But once again I can't remember if they were already closed to begin with.  We talk about it and go to sleep.  The plane is now made a 180 degree turn is just about lined up to the runway.  The hanger the plane rested in is hundreds of yards away  After a few more nights of weird stuff girlfriend and I go to bed and minutes later fall asleep.  Fast forward 8 hours later I get up and ready myself for work. House is a two story BTW.  30 minutes later I'm dressed.  I'm dressed enough to go venture down stairs and either make some coffee, throw something in the trash, grab my laptop brief case or what ever.  When I get down stairs this is what I see.

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140521_171829096_HDR.jpg

every door on the 1st floor. Every cabinet door is wide open.  

We began finding our kitchen like this for several weeks and months in 2012, and coming home after work in 2014.

ADT security and motion and home monitoring in place 24/7.

No pets. No hole in the attic. No super squirrel or super raccoon.

With the flight tower clearing the plane for take off. The plane takes off.  Activity spikes here on out. The plane is airborne and gaining altitude.

The Poltergeists has fun run out of patience with us and upped the ante to where plausible denial can go to hell.  The games afoot and this story is 100% real.

Just thought I'd share one account out of many

<TITLE> Have a Ghost - Documentation is Key </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-29 06:47:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So theres one thing Ive recently realized is going to benefit the house occupant should he or she ever be faced with a home occupied by Ghosts. I use the word Ghosts loosely as the word Ghosts could apply to variety of things.  For this read well just say entity or entities plural.  The thing Ive learned that are important to an investigator entering your home is the need for good documentation. Documentation of events.

 The compliment I get the most from teams entering my home is the level of detail of which things have occurred. Be it a paranormal team, minister, clergy, Priest, Bishop or reverend the need for good documentation is important.  Most paranormal web sites if their worth their weight in gold should have a downloadable PDF or word doc questionnaire. The questions be they generic at times are important and should be filled out in earnest by anyone trying to get to the root cause as to what events if any are happening in their home.  The things Ive learned over time helps complete those questionnaires more quickly and efficiently is ones ability to keep good notes.

 There is a such thing of mediocre documentation and good documentation.  I humbly say do it good or dont do it all.  In dealing with the paranormal I cant over stress the need for good documentation.  So how do we define it?

 The process is both simple and complex.  Youve already asked the question.  Is my house haunted?  The answer immediately should be why do you think your house is haunted?  Whats happening to make you come to that conclusion? Or better yet maybe you havent reached that conclusion but need and want to. Guess what good documentation will help you sort it out.

 Obviously if youre having thoughts of your house being haunted  - there might be a governing piece worthy of setting up to reach yes or no conclusion.   Perhaps a Tier 1 level of deduction you want to sort out before escalating to Tier 2.  Tier 2 being any individual living outside the home that may be able to help you. In the realm of good documentation there is no such thing as too much information. After all the answer to your question might be days, weeks, or months away. How many of us can remember the subtle things happening in our home say last night?  Well try remembering the subtle things 3 months ago. Here is where documenting helps the most.

 Good documentation is simply keeping a record of weird things happening in your home you think may or may not be ghost related   (theres that word again).

 Here are my tips for documenting the paranormal or normal I should say.

What should I document?
 The rule for documenting has both a liberal and conservative approach to it.  Obviously there are many things in the home not worthy of documenting. The refrigerator re-filling the ice tray is one of them.  But if theres something in your home that makes you pause and by pause raise an eye-brow and have a mental thought as to what was that? if that what was that moment has happened more than a few times  it time to start documenting.  Keep in mind if you can rule it out with logic then strike through it labeling it a false-positive. In all practical purposes false positives will occur.  Theyre supposed to.

Why am I documenting? 
 Shouldnt the paranormal investigators document when they get here? To document means to trust your gut instincts. No one knows your home better than you. The human body can detect  an foreign object and go to work immediately ascertaining whats its purpose, friend or foe? If foe steps are auto-kicked to begin the removal process. Homes are the same way. Trust your 6th sense while at the same time dont give into paranoia
 Paranormal teams will always document when investigating a home. Those that dont  kindly show them the door. What helps them is your good record keeping. The ability to compare notes. Ascertain and troubleshoot are more paramount than ever before.  As human beings we tend to forget things rather quickly. Things with little consequence early on get over written memory wise by other current events. We keep documents i.e. journal, diary, log keeping to assist us later on.  In a field where one size never fits all, good documentation is probably the most not sought after constant within the realm of paranormal investigations. If a team is not going to sit down and go over the events youve documented before, during and after they start their investigation once again kindly show them the door.

What does documenting consist of?  We dont know what we dont know
Since were talking about the paranormal pretty much anything and everything. Remember think conservative and liberal.  Ex. if you hear a loud BANG of unknown origin not only should you document the bang itself but equally important is the time of the bang, the day of the week the bang occurred, where were you when you heard it. Where were others in your home when the bang occurred.  How loud was it ?(use a scale of 1-5) and assign a number value.  What were the events prior to the bang?  What were the events after?  Are you starting to get the idea?
 In June  July of 2012 in my house loud bangs would begin at 8:04. Not 8:00pm But 8:04pm. It took me weeks before I realized that.  Interestingly enough by the time I realized that and updated my record keeping the bangs started an hour later and got louder. Those particulars are extremely important. Most never make sense right then and there but trust me, someone investigating your case later on will regard your documentation as the notes of Mozart.  It takes time, effort and dedication.

Who should be documenting events in my home? 
 Good question. Easy answer. The adults of the home. If something is happening in your home that causing you to raise questions, wake up in mid sleep, retrace your steps, constantly ask your spouse if he or she turned off the lights to a room you was just in then the one documenting might as well be yourself. The need and will to document is not for everyone.  Me personally I love documenting. Im a IT project manager and documenting and the importance gets drilled into us from day one. Just ask the PMI organization.  That being said no one should go it alone. If others in your house are witnessing and seeing stuff then its important you document their accounts.  I have one word thats important to you if you are to take up the task of documenting. Verbiage.  How its being talked about is exactly how it should be recorded.  Remember that cop show called Dragnet?  I love it when that lead detective would take down notes from the witness and his tag line which became famous was just the facts maam , just the facts. If your son saw a little green man walk across the room while going to the bathroom how he reports it should be how you record it.  Remember the noise being heard is whats being documented there is no such thing as noise (too much info) in good record keeping.

Different Types of documenting
 Now when one says documenting one immediately might think that applies to just writing stuff down and youre right it does. Nearly 90% if not more of good documentation requires pen and pad. Or does it?  Ladies and gentlemen behold the 21st century and the era of the smart phone. Pen and pad is great but lets face it those items can go missing just as quickly as a your missing set of car keys which if it did go missing better be logged in your documentation.  Where was it taken?  When was it taken?  When was it last seen?  What was it last used for?  Who touched it last? Etc.  So to prevent the documentation of evidence from becoming evidence theres something you can do.  Electronic documentation. Technology will become your best friend if you but knew how easily accessible it was. Its all around us now.   The best form of documenting electrically is emailing yourself.  Email accounts are free to setup. Within minutes you create a Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook account and youre in business. All 3 can be accessed from a smart phone and guess what when you email yourself or anyone for that matter there are multiple time stamps taking place. Make sure to document within the email the actual time the event occurred and send email to self. Reason for this some networks have lag and the time stamp shown in your inbox might not be exact time the event occurred. Remember you want to be concise as possible. If a light went off at 10:15pm dont round up or down. Log it as Example light went off and on at 10:15pm Tuesday, was baking cookies, weather is clear, 54 degrees outside, 68 degrees inside. Why is everything I just listed important?  What if the lights going off and on is a weekly thing?  Every Tuesday at 10:15pm the lights go off. Well I doubt you bake cookies every week let alone at 10:15pm but if youre like me youre going to forget the time you actually was baking cookies once 7 days have passed.  But an investigator combing your logs or maybe even you combing over your own logs notice a pattern of the lights going off at the same time once every week. On Tuesday. Last week you was baking cookies.  This week you was..balancing your check book at the kitchen table. The week after that at 10:15pm you was folding laundry. But guess what at 10:15pm the lights didnt go off.  And by lights I mean a particular light down stairs.  Is it starting to make sense now?  The reason for good record keeping is for you and I to rule out events in the home being paranormal. 99.9% of all events are not paranormal. But keep in mind while youre attempting to rule out something you might be ruling in something. One of you reading this will be that 1%. And if you are, good documentation will be important.
 Now here is where some of you reading this will part company with me.  But to the home occupant stay put and dont go nowhere.

 There are some in the paranormal field that say documentation is not evidence.  Guess what?  There wrong. Not only are they wrong these investigators you never want near your house. The need for documentation has several components attached to it. The first component is the obvious one which most paranormal investigators will agree with. Ruling out the obvious. There a trillion different things happening within a home that when revealed to some people might cause them to suspect ghost activity.  If you just came back from seeing the latest and greatest scary movie at the local Regal cinema you might want to delay documenting your home for 6 months. J/K LOL

 Just saying. The purpose of documenting is to determine whats home grown i.e. house noise, people noise, tree noise, dish washer trying to tell you its about to die, etc. Those things be they man made, human made are not going to escalate. They plateau immediately.   The second component to documentation is capturing the things that are not man-made. Those things be it paranormal (but we dont have enough to go on yet) tend to escalate and repeat themselves.  There are two words worth remembering here. Trend Analysis.  Study those words for a second and incorporate it with two other words: Common Sense.  The best evidence of all is common sense. If a chair slides across the floor. By all means document the occurrence but guess what youre no longer living in the do I have a ghost in my house phase  The ghost just answered your question. Congratulations youve entered a new phase. Might not be the phase you was hoping but congrats non-the-less youve reached it.

 Be your culprit a Ghost or human. Good documentation is going to reveal  one or the other over time.  Documentation is evidence - it is the precursor, the preamble and the index to what is or what isn't happening in your home.  Let no one tell you otherwise.  Is it the Holy Grail evidence?  No such thing. But once again depends what you documented. All evidence is relative. Some will find value in what you documented. Some will say its hog wash. Experience has taught me those that find value in documentation i.e. your documentation are in fact the ones worthy of being in your home.  90% of Paranormal Investigative work is labor intensive. There are no short cuts.  Combing through pages and pages of written material is equally as important as walking down a hallway with a voice recorder.

 Remember the decision to document is for you if you already have begun the thought process of suspecting weirdness in the home. It could be a raccoon in the attic. Maybe it is . Maybe it isnt. Time will tell. If its a raccoon what have you lost? Ill conclude with one final example. If you have guests over and a guests walks up and tells you they keep getting the feeling of something pushing or brushing their hair. Is that evidence? Should it be documented?  Tic toc tic toc.  The answer is yes.  Once again liberal   conservative actualities must be weighed in conjunction with common sense. If youre child has been telling you the same thing for weeks  definitely document it. And if youre like me  email your friend days later and kindly ask them to re-live that moment. Get their verbiage in email form.  The thing I noticed about activities escalating in the home is #1 their unpredictable. You, me, us, aka the house occupant are usually the last to know when activity is escalating. But I challenge anybody to go back and review their good documentation and not see the trend of where the activity is spiking.

 Wont make sense now but if you are the 1% that has paranormal events in your home.  Good proactive documenting will go a long way. Good teams find it useful

Thanks

<TEXT> Update is several Bibles are still missing. The Virgin Mary statue and the holy water a Priest gave us is missing.  All of this was last summer and last fall. The theory believed now based on the history  of the land and some of the wall marking which are Native American in origin is Christian themes , and symbols upset this demonic or Poltergeist whose roots are Native American.

Bothell WA has a rich but troubled history with the local natives. Especially back in mid 1800's.

Each time we erect a Christian symbol for protection we're in a since challenging or double daring the Poltergeists, or evil spirit.

Last House cleansing ( exorcism ) by an episcopal priest was July of this year.

So many items are missing I doubt we'll see them again. Perhaps the future tenants will.

<TEXT> You assume I have selfish gains. I'm simply sharing and it riddles my mind why that concept is so hard for some people to believe. There is a such thing of seeking help and documenting what goes on in one's house with the hopes of sharing it with others while help arrives. You're telling me if you're stranded on a deserted island you're not going to try to learn the in's and outs of the island till help arrives?  What if help never arrives and its just you forever.  What then?  Documenting everything in one's house down to the day of the week it transpires is what true paranormal investigators tell you to do.  It's impossible to memorize every event especially since the new events supersede the old.  In this field were inconsistency is severely frowned upon and where peopel scream fake and hoax more than they try to sincerely analyze something its a wonder why a community like this exists. No one's trying to fool anyone?  I'm not here to make you believe. I'm here to share what little I've captured while living in the house I now live in. No more no less. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's mischievous, and definitely malevolent.  We tried asking for stuff back. Stuff never comes back. Stuff we never owned, i.e. previous tenants stuff come back. Two Bibles are missing. Two crosses are missing. A Virgin Mary statue left by the Priest is missing.  24/7 hour surveillance with house cams finally caught the apparition in the doorway.  http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/Apparition_Bedroom_2015.jpg </TEXT>

<TITLE> Missing Cross (Gone for a Week) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-20 16:51:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The events of this day will always be remembered because it was the weekend Captain America the Winter Soldier came out. April 2014 - I believe the 1st weekend of.

A month prior to this movie premier my cousin from Dallas came to visit.  Elementary school teacher Dallas sub-urb. Devout Christian. She was in the know of our paranormal events and decided to bring with her a wooden-metallic cross. Written on the cross itself were the verses Joshua 1:9, Phil 4:13, Psalm 28:7 and Matt 19:26 summation "Strength."  

Cross was prayed over and immediately hung in our bedroom at the time - the 3rd most active place of the house BUT being the place were we slept and layed our head. A cross positioned high upon the wall seemed accurate.

A week or so before the Capt America movie came out the cross went missing. (Keep in mind I'm only referring Capt America because the same weekend it came out is [b]also the same day I was going to see it.[/b]) So a week before the cross went missing. And missing objects in our home is not new. Things get taken all the time. Sometimes they return. Sometimes they don't.. The items that do return never get returned in the place they were taken. This cross would be no exception.  

We noticed it missing the morning we woke up . Other religious objects had been taken before and with the house being severely active and etc friends, family and clergy all advised us to display our belief system openly as a means of riding the home of negative spirits.  I'm a Christian. I wouldn't call myself a devout Christian but a believer non-the-less.

So the cross is gone. Its missing. Girlfriend and myself at this stage gave up the notion of even looking for it after all it was gift from my cousin, a spiritual  gift at that, a gift from the heart, no one else lived with us and objects get taken all the time, and items we eagerly search for never come back.  

Now its Saturday morning (movie day) and the cross has been gone for a few days and like most typical Saturdays in my house its laundry day. By 11am I'm doing my laundry because in a few hours I'm going to leave and go meet one of my best friends for drinks and movies.  The guys, us geeks if you will are descending into Bellevue WA to watch the Capt American Winter Soldier movie  GF doesn't get into stuff like that but I do. us guys do.

I began my first load of laundry - colored clothing. GF, Tina is to and fro around the house doing her own thing. While my clothes is washing I decide to go into my office and watch TV, work on my PC , post in forums like this in search for answers to our Poltergeist problem. 

About an hour later I notice something peculiar. My 1st load of clothing is still washing. Now I know there are long wash cycles but this was weird my brain knows how long it takes for my clothes to wash. So I'm in my office and I glance towards the wash room hoping to here the beep beep beep, the noise the washing makes  it's done.  Clothes don't wash for an hour, esp my clothes, esp a light load of clothing. So I glance at the wash room and sort of look at the time on my PC toolbar and raise an eye brow and after that I mentally shrug it off and keep working. A few minutes later I hear this knocking sound, banging, knocking. You know the sound the washing machine or dryer makes when you have shoes or a big object in it. So I hear this noise and its clearly coming from the washing machine - and once again I glance up from my PC and turn to face the washing machine or wash room I should say. Now in my mind I'm thinking - that sound wasn't there before?  All I put in the washing machine was clothing. Coins, chap stick, keys, etc wouldn't make that noise. And even if it did those sounds would have been heard almost immediately. At this point the cycle had run near to over an hour. So why the loud noises now?  Now normally I would get up. Walk to the washing machine and open and see what the commotion is about. But something prevented that idea from crossing my mind in that I was either pre-occupied on my PC or pre-occupied watching TV. It was very uncharacteristic of me to not stop what I was doing and investigate.  Looking back and reliving the moment, It felt weird for me to not get up and investigate the noise esp with the previous events happening in this house. I acknowledged the noise and length of time it was taking for that load to complete and stayed in my office.

A few minutes later the washing machine finally beeps informing me that the load is complete. Few minutes after the beep I get up and go to the washing machine to remove my clothes from washing machine to the dryer. As I'm pulling out clothes and tossing them into the dryer (few inches away) I immediately grab something solid. Not clothing. Not shoes. Not anything except a metallic-wooden cross. I didn't know what it was until I pulled it out of the washing machine.

There in my hand, wet and etc. Was the missing cross my cousin gave me.  Two key points I want to make before I submit this story to you (which is 100% true). Some will say "well maybe the cross was already in there to begin with."  Not so. As I mentioned above the bang, knocking noise, the noise we all are familiar with-those who have done laundry-where large objects i.e. shoe, etc are in the machine. The noise would have been heard early on, esp during the spin cycle. The knocking noises I heard began 15 minutes before the washing was complete. When my machine is done it beeps.  And also the washing machine was empty when I filled it with my clothing.  Some might say well maybe you put the cross in the machine when you loaded it up with clothes. Nope. It was a colored clothing(Machine Wash COLD/WARM).  I sorted my clothing carefully meaning items go into the machine almost one by one. A cross this size is not going to be grabbed by mistake.  

Someone will also say well maybe your GF put the cross in the machine.  My GF was not even near the washing machine. I never left my office. The washroom sits right outside my office.  And she wouldn't stop my wash load regardless.  I do my laundry and she does hers.

I had to get those particulars out the way because I know how some people like to gravitate to the obvious.  And that understandable but allow me to paint the picture near perfect as possible because it even hasn't began to get weird yet.  In my hand is the cross my cousin gave me. Its wet and broken (see pic below).  I then call my girlfriend and when she comes to the hallway we both examine the cross top to bottom.  It had been taken the week before. About 4-5 days prior.

Like I said before this would not be the 1st, 2nd , or 3rd time something like this has happened in my house. Now you see the reason why we're displaying the religious objects is because of the stuff happening before, during, and after this cross went missing.  Interesting enough after I glued this cross back together and placed it back in its original spot. It would be taken a few more times. Never re-appeared in the washing machine again though. 

The other tricks the Poltergeists did or would do with this same cross I will share later on.  This is a forum for sharing Ghost encounters or Paranormal experiences. So I'm sharing.  

Below are two pics.

One pic shows the cross as it looks like when hanging in our bedroom.  The second pic you see is of the cross after it was taken out of the washing machine. Pic is literally seconds after that event had happened.

[u]The Paranormal Group B.U.M.P.S[/u]
and its founder Kyle can attest to the events of this story and others as his team was called soon after
to investigate.

I felt like sharing this. I have my theories to how all of this transpired. 

But I'm eager to hear your response and theory before I offer a few of mine.

this post will alert trolls. But I'm hoping some intellectuals in the paranormal field and those who think outside the box find there way here as well.

<TEXT> thats all they are are opinions. Opinions from skeptics/scenic who think all re-counts of an individuals experience is fake until evidence is shown that proves other wise. 99% of them are not even investigators but more so Ghost Enthusiasts who view the subject matter scenically anyways. I mean if this page and others like went by that notion this forum would be empty.  Opinions come a dime a dozen. All cases reported had doubters, disbelievers, and nay sayers.

<TITLE> 2nd Bible Burning - Ghost? Demon? or Poltergeists ? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-14 19:43:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 2nd Bible Burning
It was a April Sunday morning where Tina and I were awakened to loud bangs, door slams and just out right feeling of uneasiness. We woke up abruptly somewhat irritable by the unpredictable events.  By now we had our 1st Bible that went missing a year ago return on fire and now this Sunday morning a series of bangs and thuds to where we had no choice but to wake up. 
Even with the 1st Bible being set on fire the consensus among the local paranormal teams, friends and local religious houses was stay proactive and assertive with your belief and decorate the house surroundings with religious symbols..  The #1 recommendation being continue placing religious: Christian themes out in the open. By open I mean book shelf, door way, door entry, above the chimney area or coffee tale.  
So within a few days a 2nd Bible was placed on the hallway book shelf. No cameras, no nothing.  The Bible was opened to Psalms 91 and 92 and the prayers or hymn on those pages were recited internally by us.
On this particular Sunday after being jolted awake  and  doing the  normal routine of brushing ones teeth, showering and etc. I left our bedroom and ventured around the upstairs rooms.  It was a normal Sunday. Nothing different except the hauntings I just described. But before I sit down either in my office or down stairs I need coffee.  And it was when I leaving my room-coming out of the master bedroom that when glancing left towards the book shelf I noticed the Bible was missing.  Tina and I kept passing each other in the hallway and when I noticed it missing I immediately asked Tina did she move it. Her answer was no.
One thing Ive learned is anytime an activity happens in the morning and we are immediately made aware of it-something BIG is about to happen. And I dont mean BIG like eminent danger.  Maybe I do and I just dont realize it. But in most cases something else is about to happen. No activity happens on its own. Theres always another shoe about to drop. The Bible was missing and I know I saw it before going to bed. 
There was no point in searching for the Bible I mean one had been missing for months and here this one- a Gideons Bible was now missing and we had no idea if and when it would return, but the house was crazy active this morning. Sundays are the worse.  I think Tina and I searched no more than 20 seconds before I was off down stairs to make my coffee. And thats what I did. I went down and did the whole make me some coffee routine. So I started brewing coffee and while that was going on I headed back upstairs.
10 minutes or so had passed when I left my office to go make my full-fledged cup of coffee.  Tina was to and fro doing laundry.  I ventured down stairs and upon turning the corner and entering the wide open area of my kitchen there in the middle of the island was the missing Bible.  Albeit somewhat different in appearance.  The Bible was sitting on the island, pages open and it was scorched. I mean the pages were literally burned to a crisp. I immediately called Tina. She darted down and we both looked at the Bible.  It had to have been missing for a few hours. Where it was so it burn and not set off the fire alarm is anybodys guess but then again thats another piece of mystery to it. The pages were scorched but it appeared the pages burned from being exposed to extreme heat vs. someone purposely setting a match to it.  We didnt burn it.  Gods honest truth we had nothing to do with it. The Bible was on the hallway book shelf, albeit the pages were spread open to Psalms now with it being burned and the pages incinerated a majority of Psalms were gone.  Including the lords prayer.
Tina and I both got on the phone and started calling some paranormal teams and alerting local clergy again.  To this day I still dont know whats harder to deal with a unpredictable Poltergeists or people saying they can help you but wont.  A few hours later I would be in my office researching the internet looking for help and assistance. Whatever that was haunting us was not through with us yet. The next event to happen that day would be wax on the wall.  Both videos are below. They have not been edited, shorted or lengthened in any way. Both Bible burning and wax on the wall happened on the same day.  Like I said before for a period of about 8 months the worse day of all days when living in that house is Sunday.
When the entity wakes you its almost as if its waking you to say Its time to play.

Both events happened on the same day. There would be 3 Bibles and more burned in my house this was the 2nd one.

I can tell in our house objects have been thrown when the house was filled with laughter, glee and objects have been thrown when we were both fearful. There's really no rhyme or reason (at least not with our situation). I can only speak about my account; our account and how it relates to other documented cases.

There are parallels to other cases and their are unique differences.  IMO this Poltergeists is tied to the land , I could e wrong but I base that on the fact that previous tenants had their own accounts and they moved.  As of right now no one in their new homes are experiencing weird activity. Just this house regardless of the tenants occupying it.

That's me and us for now.

There things and events about this case that are rare and deserve deeper study.

I stand by that and welcome any genuine input available.

Key word being genuine.

Maybe this is easier. Sounds when the house is empty. I'm not recording this a Paranormal Team is. I'm out of town. the sounds you hear are sounds associated with Poltergeists.

[BEST TO LISTEN IN ITS ENTIRETY VS SKIPPING TO JUST THE NOISE MOMENTS] Haunted House - House Monitoring. For the entire summer of 2015 several paranormal teams came to assist Keith L in documenting the events inside his house. Events spoken briefly on Ghost Adventures aka Demons In Seattle episode. Its believed now that many spirits (+) or ( -) traverse through the home BUT the main constant is a Poltergeist tied to the land. This video is a remote viewing. House is empty and thus is being monitored while occupant is away. You will hear noises. You will hear strange sounds, interference and more captured by teams more experienced in dealing with these types of haunting. 1:29, 2:40, 4:10, 4:20, 6:00, 10:05, 12:00 LOUD Bang, 15:20,23:40 (major noises), 33:11 (major noise) cabinet door sound.33:50 noise, camera tinkering, 34:10 camera tinkering, noise, static, team does some configuration, 36:11 Noise or Motion detected ?? 36:47 noise heard, camera interference, static. 37:00 noises, static, intereference, 38:00 noises and voice, unsure if that is the team, possible evp? Just now sure. 38:57 noise, static, interference 41:35 voice, interference and static. These cameras do not transmit two way audio - not sure how voices are being captured. But the noise must be in the house as the camera sound detection is going off. 43:11 noises with the static.44:00 interference. 44:18 somethings happening with the camera equipment. 44:44 tap noise. 45:18 noise, taps, static, this interference is not coming from the team. 46:00 motion or noise alert goes off. BEST WITH HEAD SETS ON. Additional info. https://app.box.com/s/r5ta5kk6p4qr6t1... and https://app.box.com/s/mkkuf2a9kpyiqzq...   best with headsets </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all IceDagger316 (hope I spelled that right --let me look, yes I did) first of all if you're going to reply back to me you might want to educate yourself a little bit about the workings of Ghosts and Poltergeist. And while you're doing that you might want to stop thinking in 2 dimensional terms. Heck you shouldn't even be thinking in 3D or 4 Dimensional terms either. Everything a Poltergeists does defies logic. I'm sort of shocked ( well not really I was the same way as you when all this started) But I wised up. The more events happened and I admit my IQ is higher than yours about this subject matter because I lived it for 3 years. I'm still living it. But I digress. You're trying to rationalize and find meaning as to why a Poltergeists would hang a pair of pants on the doorway is like me trying to rationalize why a bumble bee can fly.  It flies because it can. Same thing with a Poltergeists. Do your home work and you'll everything a Poltergeists does defies logic aka doesn't make sense, aka is weird, aka rhyme and reason don't apply here. Get it? Got it?  Comprende esse'?


And after you've done thorough home work and thorough reading  grab a head set and listen to a true Paranormal Team investigation

<TITLE> House Attack June 2014. And loud bang from Bedroom Door March 2014. </TITLE>

June 30th 2014. Motion detection, camera movements and furniture displacement into my upstairs office, kitchen and living room. Key indicators of an active Poltergeists. To dispel the break end theory. This has happened numerous times. I've seen the apparition 3 times. Previous tenants have come forth and have explained they had similar activity while living in the house. They had children we do not.  Of course none of this started abruptly. What started first was foot steps, occasional thud or two, waking up finding all cabinet doors open, lights and TV go off and on by themselves and items going missing. ADT security *Pulse was installed to monitor the doors and windows to rule out intruders and outside sources.  Communication to the church, clergy and paranormal teams bought about the hanging up of religious objects to ward off negative energy and spirits. This plus Sagging seemed to make matters worse and thats when events equal to the above video began to happen.

this video is March 2014.  Best with headsets. Loud banging on door at 3:03AM 3/27/14  4:58.   Hallway is the 2nd most active room in the house. The most active room in the house is the office. My office. We're asleep and are awakened by a BANG on the door. You will see the door shake but there's noone there. The noise even sounds like its coming from elsewhere. You'll appreciate the noise more if you wear headspeakers. 0 background noise.  Link below is the Photobucket of the 3 year ordeal.

Slideshow goes from 2015 to 2012.

<TEXT> Valuable items are never stolen. No kid or group of kids is going to break into a house a two story house and trash one room out of five and not steal anything of value. No forced entry. ADT is armed and there is no captured log of entry while we are gone. Previous tenants experienced the same thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Break in is an accurate analogy used for a Poltergeist. House is secured. There is no break in and this has happened more than once.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> House exorcism was performed in July. Since then activity has died down. Its died down before and then spikes off and on. What remains now is occasional off and on with the lights. Foot steps, thuds, occasional BANG.  All missing items are still missing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How does one say what a ghost, demon, or Poltergeist can or cannot do. Actually nailing pants or nailing objects to a wall period is level one Poltergeist activity.  Google historical cases and you'll see each case offers uniqueness and similarities. </TEXT>

April 26th 2014 
Frame 4:58 - 5:07 center stage (screen) Ghost torso.  Don't blink. Other stuff exist in video as well. My friends, my self and Paranormal Team count 6 unexplained phenomenon ( images or spirits)?  https://app.box.com/s/lmero13u8x58h27rphc6i3rl8uimj6vy . The narrative here is no legit ghost video gets created out of a vacuum. For us the story begins we moved in a house. Items began missing. Items neither of us owned started appearing. Thuds, Bumps, Taps, snaps and loud bangs begin. Every cabinet door is found wide open in a series of mornings. Then objects i.e. flower pots get thrown. Things go projectile.   Then the cameras go up to rule out intruder and the obvious. But the obvious never presents itself. Instead something more mysterious. UPDATE 2015 Finally agreed among teams we have a Poltergeist linked to the land (Property). 

activity took a turn for the worse the minute we when tried to get rid of it or bought in more cameras.

<TEXT> Questions about the DemonsInSeattle Ghost Adventures TV airing(questions never asked to us directly)

1. How did Keith and Tina come about being on the show Ghost Adventures? What was the process?

After two years of getting little help from local clergy and local teams. Two years mind you I decided to reach out to the local media. I felt the media had a back door with the local clergys and possibly could assist with getting someone on board. Activity was increasing so we needed help.

KOMO news TV responded and did a segment. They reached out to me near Halloween 2014 even though they had the info 5 months prior. This the airing.

Upon interviewing me the news anchor and camera man who accompanied her both heard a loud noise from upstairs. The noise was very distinctive and it was not house noise. I was alone in the house working from home the day when they arrived. Not shown in the interview I asked to give them a tour of the house (including the upstairs) they nervously declined. News anchor was given strict orders from Dave Schrader to not become too connected to the house for fear of attachment. I was told this upon them leaving. Invite to tour the house came after the noise was heard (to prove Im not faking it). They declined. The noise was that unsettling. Its in the video.

Less than two days after this piece aired locally. Producers of Ghost Adventures come calling. Nowhere in the interview did I ask for Ghost Adventures. I asked for local help. After experiencing the loud noise themselves the news anchor told me she had a back door connection with Ghost Adventures that being Dave Schrader. Dave called me less than two days later after the piece aired and asked if GAC could do a show on our house. He was less critical over the phone, even less critical in person. The only questions he asked about the house was the activity captured off camera and a legal question of do we own the home. I told him we rent the home. He then advised they would need the owners permission before shooting. The home owner being kept up to date on all activity within the house accepted. GAC arrived 6 weeks later and filmed the episode. </TEXT>
