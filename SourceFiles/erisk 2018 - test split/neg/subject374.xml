<TEXT> Mister Smith's view would be very interesting, as he is older than the centuries old hotel. He's a very business like and somber character. 

At some point I'd like to do an entry of him observing the behavior of his staff and drawing connections between them and a group of past employees, who met a terrible fate. 

As a result, I'd like to do more posts first from the employees that show the development of Mister Smith into a more paternal figure throughout the series, then have his elaboration and flashback, and have him become both imposing but likeable in the end.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> *There's a path in the Woods,*


*One that twists, one that turns,*


*A road forgotten and dark,*


*'Twas at the end where Witches burned.* 


I sat on the living room floor and listened to my grandmother recite the old rhyme before beginning the story we'd all heard about a million times before. I remember those times fondly, surrounded by my cousins during summer visits. We were all well into our teenaged years at that point, and the stories we were told had taken on a tone for more mature audiences.


Our grandmother loved to sit us all down and tell us the tales that have circulated this town. Often enough they were dark stories, as true history tends to go, but a few I found less believable. The history behind this specific tale was obviously based in fact, but the legend that lived in it's wake seemed too cliche.


As it was told to me, the story is quite simple. Back in the time when burning witches was trending, this town developed a plan for catching witches on the run. Many women who fled their towns in search of safety passed through here, and the townspeople were quite unhappy about this. 


They had a small group of women stand by the road to tell the fleeing women which way to go, the women from the town claimed to be fellow runaways. The accused witches believed they were on the course to safety, and like sheep they fell for the wolves trap. They followed the path into the woods. 


It ended in a sort of clearing, in the middle of which sat a tree larger than any other. That was the tree which they tied the witches to, its bark charred from the numerous executions. The tree was large enough to tie up six girls at once, it stood sturdy and did not burn easily. 


Then came the day when the townspeople led their own daughters to the path, some of them quite young. They were assumed to be witches, and they were told that they would be sent to a town of only witches so that they wouldn't harm anyone. 


They were led down the path, and the daughters burned upon the blackened tree. 


One of these daughters did not belong to the town, and her mother was distraught. No one knew of this woman, or who her daughter was, but apparently she went to the clearing in the woods. She confronted those who had burned her daughter, and they responded by swarming her and tying her to the tree. According to the tale, she burned upon the charred remains of her daughter.


Then there is the part that seems to be mere legend. The part where they leave the clearing as the woman burns, and come back hours later to find no corpse. In the following weeks each person who was part of the witch hunting was dragged into those woods without witness, never to be seen again. 


People go missing all the time in those woods these days, and it supposedly happens every time they stumble upon a strangely blackened tree deep in the forest. They say that woman is still searching for her daughter, taking others as substitute until she is found. 


The first time that I attempted to disprove the legend I was with three of my cousins. I was the youngest at 16, the twins were 17, and their older brother was 19. We decided to go down the path in the woods. 


Caroline and Samantha seemed excited to finally wander the path we had heard about for years, and their brother Andrew seemed to only tag along because he thought we'd get into trouble alone. His presence didn't stop trouble from coming. 


The path was refreshingly cool compared to the sweltering heat we had felt before stepping into the shade. An assortment of greens surrounded us, the thick foliage overhead created a dark tunnel. I expected to hear the hum of nature, but there wasn't a bird call or even the sound of clicking insects. The path was still and silent, save for our feet shuffling along the nearly overgrown trail.


Tall grass and other wildlife had choked the path, leaving the worn down dirt trail just barely visible every few steps. Thorn covered vines snaked along the ground, tripping us at times, and cutting into our ill-prepared sandal clad feet. I almost wanted to turn back, the small wounds stung as we treaded forward. 


The longer we walked, the cooler the air seemed to be. I found myself shivering at one point, and sped up my pace to keep warm. By the time we made it to the clearing my teeth were chattering. 


The clearing was dim, but we finally caught a glance at the sky for the first time in over an hour. The clouds were dark overhead, as though a thunderstorm could begin at any moment. In the center of the clearing sat a tree larger than I thought could exist. It's branches were dry and bare, the tree was long dead but still stood. 


I found myself a bit surprised that the bark of the tree was blackened just as the stories claimed. We split in two groups and wandered about in different directions, planning to meet by the tree in ten minutes. Samantha and I walked deeper into the woods behind the clearing, searching for long forgotten trinkets that may have been discarded by witch hunters. 


Within minutes it seemed as though night had fallen, checking my phone still revealed it to be early afternoon. The darkness was unsettling, and I ran to catch up to Sam who was kneeling on the ground ahead of me. 


We should head back, it's been almost ten minutes, I told her, not wanting to admit that I was actually a little afraid of the dark forest. 


She turned to me as she stood, Yeah, sure thing. 


We had taken only two steps towards the clearing when Sam abruptly turned. She stared deep into the forest, as though someone had called her. 


Sam?


She snapped her head towards me, Did you hear that?


Hear what? I stared at her in confusion, the woods were eerily silent. 


Her eyes widened before she whipped her head back to stare into the woods. Then she started running, faster than I knew she could.


Mom? *Mom!* I'm coming! She screamed as she ran, and I tried to chase her.


Within minutes she was out of sight, and I kept going. I tried listening for the sounds of her voice, but it faded soon after I lost sight of her. I wandered forward, hoping to find some trace of my cousin. I searched for awhile before realizing I should head back, and by then I was lost. 


That's when I saw her, Samantha was right ahead of me. I bolted towards her, and she turned to face me. It wasn't my cousin who stared at me. Her skin was the color of a pale violet sunrise, but most of it was scarred and deformed. She smiled at me, and I stood there like a deer in the headlights.


I'm am Mother. Do you have my baby? She tilted her head to the side as though to examine me.


N-no, I stumbled out as she came closer.


She stepped forward and walked a circle around me, looking me over head to toe. I shivered in fear as she ran a mottled hand down my arm, then through my hair. Then she brought her face close to my neck and inhaled deeply. 


She stepped back and frowned at me, No, but you will. A deal then, though payment made thrice. You will come back in two years, you will bring my baby, and I will return what I have taken.


I didn't know what to do, I wanted to run. I wanted to scream. I was staring at a woman with purple skin and small tree branches growing from her joints. She was a monster, she the *the witch*, and she terrified me. I nodded, too afraid to know the outcome of refusing. 


She bit her thumb, and without having applied any pressure it began to bleed. I shivered at the realization of how sharp those teeth must be. She smeared the blood across her bottom lip, then stepped toward me faster than humanly possible. Before I knew it we were locked in a kiss, and she stepped away before I had a chance to react.


Our deal is binding, she smiled before bringing her blood smeared lips close to my ear and whispering, *Now run, little rabbit.* 


I could swear I heard her laughing as I sprinted in the opposite direction. I started walking when I ran out of breath, and thought over what had just occurred. It wasn't possible. I touched my fingers to my lips and they came back bloody, another impossibility. It took me a minute to discover that I was actually bleeding, I hadn't felt the witch bite me. I licked the blood off my lips and trudged on.


I don't know where I was or how long I had been walking before I collapsed on the ground in tears, but I remember that I heard the sound of birds and other wildlife between my sobs. I couldn't handle the situation I had found myself in.


It was warmer here, and I ended up crying myself to sleep under a mossy tree. I was awoken by the panicked faces of Andrew and Caroline, through the foliage I could see the sun was starting to set. They told me I was over an hour away from the tree, and they were lucky to find me at all. I told them that I'd lost Sam, and we all searched together until it got dark. 


That's when our simple teenaged minds realized that we needed help, and we commenced the long journey back to our grandparents house. We went to every resource to help search for Samantha. I never told a soul about the witch in the woods.


The night passed, a week passed, a month passed, over two years-- three years at the end of August-- have passed and still no one has found my cousin. Our grandparents banned us from the woods after that, but I broke that rule last summer. 


It was the two year anniversary of Samantha's disappearance, and I was due for a visit with the creature who called herself *Mother*. I left my grandparents house in the middle of the night, and set down the path in the woods.


It was cold and dark, and it seemed to take forever. When I got to the clearing there was someone waiting beneath the charred tree. It wasn't *Mother.* 


It was a boy I recognized. He had lived in this town as long as I'd been visiting, and I knew him. We were friends, but we didn't see each other except during summer. If I'm entirely honest, I'd had a crush on him for the duration of our teenaged years. He was the most beautiful boy in town.


Luke? What are you doing here? I gave him a curious look, then glanced around the clearing to check for any other unexpected guests.


I'm um.. not what you think I am, he smiled sheepishly and looked at the ground, it *almost* settled my unease.


What? I accidentally let a nervous laugh slip out, the situation suddenly seemed very awkward. 


I'm here for the Mother.. You owe her something, he seemed to blush when he said it, and it took me a moment to realize why.


The horrifying forest witch wanted me to *have* a baby for her. I don't know what came over me, but I burst into hysterical laughter. Luke stared at me as though I'd gone mad before his very eyes.


Then he walked over to me and gripped me by the shoulders. He looked at me very seriously before telling me that he wasn't human, and he didn't actually look like the person standing in front of me. He told me he was raised with humans who thought he was theirs, and that this sort of thing happened a lot. He told me that he was sorry that I ended up in this situation, and that I should have stayed away from the woods.


He also offered to have a more attractive suitor of his kind attend to me, and I just stood there and stared. At some point during his speech I had realized that this was the only option to save my cousin, and maybe the other missing people. At least it was with a nice guy (is it okay to call an inhuman creature a nice guy?), and it could be worse. Women have babies all the time, and then give them up for adoption. Except for the part where mine would be inhuman and traded to save someone else. *Close Enough.*


He kissed me while I was staring at him, and I just kind of gave in. I won't get into the details, but at some point during that night in the clearing there was a little inhuman creature conceived. 


I've seen Luke a few times since then while visiting my grandparents, but no one knows about what happened. They've made sure of that. Where I live several hours away there is a small section of woods behind my house. Every few days one of *them* comes to the edge of the treeline and watches my house. I didn't tell anyone about them. 


Some of them had horns, or skin of the oddest colors. Some seemed transparent, scaled, or grew plants from their bodies. I didn't understand what they were, but they always requested my secrecy by holding a finger to their lips. 


I kept everything a secret just as I had kept my initial meeting with the witch a secret. When the baby bump became noticeable I lied about a mistaken one night stand with a stranger. I've told my family the baby is going to be adopted.


I'm due in about two weeks, and then I drive out to bring the baby to her new family. I don't know what happens after that.


After all I've been through I hoped to get my cousin back, and maybe everyone else who was taken too, but this morning I woke up to a strange message. 


A note was tucked under my closed bedroom window.


*When the delivery is honored,*


*All the lost shall be let free,*


*Except you, debt ower*


*You still owe payments two and three.*


It seems I didn't pay enough attention to the deal I made.

<TITLE> Grandma's Stories </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Back when my cousins and I were teenagers and visited our grandparents each summer, we were told stories. Our grandmother wanted to reveal to us the real darkness of the town's past. I never quite believed one story though.


This was back in the time when witches were burned, and this town developed a plan for catching witches on the run. Many women who fled their towns passed through here, and the townspeople were unimpressed.


They had a group of women stand by the road to tell the fleeing women which way to go, while the women from the town claimed to be fellow runaways. The accused witches believed the false claims, and like sheep they fell for the wolves trap. They followed the path into the woods. 


It ended in a clearing with a large tree in the center. That was what they tied the witches to, the bark charred from numerous executions. It was large enough to tie up six girls at once, it stood sturdy and did not burn easily. 


Then came the day when the townspeople led their own daughters to the path, some of them quite young. They were assumed to be witches, and they were fed lies about where the path led. 


They went down the path, and the daughters burned upon the blackened tree. 


One of these daughters did not belong to the town, and her mother was distraught. No one knew where she came from, but she went to the clearing in the woods. She confronted those who had burned her daughter, and they responded by swarming her and tying her to the tree. According to the tale, she burned upon the charred remains of her daughter.


This is the part that caused my disbelief:

They left the clearing as the woman burned, and came back hours later to find no corpse. In the following weeks each person who was part of the witch hunting was dragged into those woods, never to be seen again. 


It's true that people go missing all the time in those woods these days, but rumour says it happens when they encounter a blackened tree deep in the forest. They say that woman is still searching for her daughter.


I wanted to disprove it, so at the age of 16 I tried. Three of my cousins came along, the twins and their older brother. 


Samantha, Caroline, Andrew l, and I went down the path. We found the blackened tree. Four teenagers went into the woods, and three came out. We told everyone we had lost Samantha.


I knew the truth though. Two years ago Samantha never returned from the woods, and I made a deal to change that. 


I recently found out I'm carrying a baby-- actually the spawn of a strange boy from the woods, but that's a story for another time. Now I'm only six months away from saving my cousin. 


I'll finally give the woman in the woods the baby she's been searching for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was at a party when I first saw her. I was a little more than a little drunk, and dancing in the middle of a group of girls who, like me, wanted to avoid the hands of overconfident drunk guys. Normal situation, normal night for us. That's when I noticed the girl, and my mind seemed to block out everything but her at that moment. 


She looked *just like me*. One of my friends bumped into me while I was staring, and I ended up losing sight of her. I was drunk, I could have been staring at my reflection in a window for all I knew, so I shrugged it off. 


I stumbled my way back to the dorm with my roommate, Megan, and we both fell asleep as soon as we hit our beds. The next morning I awoke to an abundance of text messages, almost all of them about similar topics.


*You were acting really strange last night.*


*Who was that guy you were with?*


*Did you make it home okay?*


Concern and confusion flooded my inbox, and I had no idea why. I'd had a few drinks, I'd danced with my friends, and then I went home. There was no guy, there was no acting strange, and there should have been no worry about me walking a few blocks home with my roommate. I remembered the entire night, and none of these messages made sense. 


I responded to everyone in confusion, and most of them dropped it assuming it must have been someone who looked similar. There were a few who pressed on, one even sent a picture. It looked like me, from behind at least. Whoever it was was pressed up against a guy. I disproved that person by sending a picture of myself last night, wearing an obviously different outfit from the girl in the photo. 


I used the same method to calm everyone else down, they had all seen a girl who looked like me but hadn't been dressed like me. The situation stressed me out first thing in the morning, but the day wasn't over yet. 


Megan and I left to head over to our friends apartment, and I received a phone call on the way. I don't remember the entire conversation, but it was a guy who said I'd given him this number last night. I told him he was given the wrong number. 


I didn't start getting concerned until we got to the apartment and our friend Amy answered the door. She gave me a confused look.


Did you forget something? She asked me.


What? Last weekend? I don't think so, I texted you this morning that I was coming over, I responded in confusion.


Danielle, you literally just left. Like ten minutes ago, 


I've been with her, that's not possible, Megan cut in. 


Amy looked back and forth between the two of us, Okay, I don't have time to be fucked with today. I need to study.


She closed the door and we stood there dumbstruck. 


Wow, I attempted to fill the silence in the hallway.


That was weird, but whatever. Let's just leave, Megan responded as she started walking towards the stairs. 


The rest of the day went fine, an average Sunday spent lounging in our room. I had class the next morning, and attempted to get to bed early. I had the strangest nightmare that night.


I was walking around going about my day as normal, but everyone I tried to talk to seemed to be unable to hear me. I would scream, and they would look at me oddly. As the dream progressed people stopped being able to see me, and I wandered around like a lonely ghost. The dream ends when I see my reflection, except that there is a smooth blank plane instead of a face. I woke up wondering how I saw without any eyes.


The dream was unsettling, and I found it hard to wake up from. I managed to get up on time, but somehow I still ended up leaving late. I still had time before class, but I'd be cutting it close.


I felt exhausted, and I needed something to fix that before class. Every morning I stopped in the small coffee shop and ordered the same thing, but when I walked up to the counter I was met with a confused glance. 


Did you spill your drink? 


What? 


I gave you your usual order just five minutes ago.


I wasn't sure what to tell the barista, so I just admitted to spilling the drink and needing another one. I got my drink and left confused, I didn't understand what was happening. 


I was a few minutes late to class, but the professor hadn't started the lecture yet. Things were fine, and the rest of the day seemed normal, and I had the same dream that night.


The next morning I ended up late to another class, and I needed to hand in an assignment immediately. I quickly walked up to his desk, searching my bag for it as I went. I couldn't find it, and I apologized as I reached his desk. 


You already handed that in.


I did?


Yes, when you first got into class, he gave me a look of concern, and I just walked away nodding. 


I could barely pay any attention during that class, wondering what was happening to me. I sat in the back of the room, and I could swear I saw a girl who looked like me sitting several rows away. I couldn't find her when class ended, but the rest of the day went smoothly.


I had the dream again that night, but this time it was faster. I woke up feeling paranoid, and throughout the day I was told that I was in places which I wasn't. 


I went to explain to the library that I needed time to find the book I had to return, but they told me I had returned it the day before. I needed to buy a textbook for a class, and went back to my dorm to grab my wallet. I found my wallet sitting on top of the textbook I needed, the receipt beside it on my bed. 


I skipped a class and went out to eat dinner, but somehow I lost my phone. When I got back to the dorm my phone was sitting on the table, open to a recording of the lecture I'd missed. I thought maybe I was being stalked, and I fell asleep paranoid that night.


Once again the dream taunted me.

Thursday was a mixture of the previous few days, and I found myself stressed out over the entire situation. I felt like I was going insane. Another night of dreaming I was fading away.


Which brings me to yesterday, where things started to become progressively more strange. I went to all my classes, and I spoke to several of my professors who wondered why I'd emailed assignments in more than once. I told them I must have hit something wrong while sending. Several of those professors, as well as a few of my friends asked if I was losing my voice. I'm not sure what they meant because I think I sound fine, but they acted like I was whispering.


Then came the evening, when I went to go back to my dorm room. I couldn't find my key, but I could hear Megan talking to someone in the room. As many times as I knocked no one seemed to hear it, I ended up walking down the hall and running into another friend who was headed into her room. She let me spend the night. I had the dream again, even faster.


I woke up early even though I had no classes in the morning. I searched everywhere for my keys, and was relieved when I found them-- stupidly enough-- in the bottom of my bag. I got back to my room and was prepared to fall into my bed for a much needed nap, but it was occupied. 


So now I'm sitting here in the library typing this up on my phone. I asked the librarian if I could use a computer, but she kept telling me to speak up and I gave up on that idea. 


There's a girl in my bed, and she looks just like me. I don't know what to do, or why she's here, or why I seem to be slowly fading out of my own life, I need help. I have no idea what's happening, but it seems like that nightmare is coming true.


The only thing I'm sure of, is that I don't want to see my reflection.

Us and them 

All building walls 

Over and over again 

The day is too cold, the sun too bright

It's all too much 

I'd rather build my walls and such

I'd rather stay warm and veiled in smoke 

I'd rather build barriers and be alone </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone deals with relationships ending. Sometimes it's because of a mutual agreement that things don't work out, sometimes things end on good terms. Sometimes things end on bad terms, and that's why a collection of businesses have popped up. They mend your heartbreak, give you closure, and ease your overall suffering. 


I never thought I'd be the type of person to use such services, but a few weeks ago my entire world seemed to fall apart. Before that it was nearly perfect. Happy roommate, happy friends, happy boyfriend. 


I was living with my friend at the time, her name was Amanda. She was great, fun to be around, interesting to talk to, a great sense of humor, and a model roommate. There were nights when we bonded while roaming the streets between bars, and she became one of my best friends.


My boyfriend was also amazing at the time, he was charming and sensitive, and he always knew the right thing to say. I started attending the college he went to when the fall semester began, and we ended up dating within a month. He was everything I could have ever wanted, and he treated me like a princess. I did everything I could to make him happy, and he did the same for me.


Unfortunately, he was supposed to transfer to a college that was across the country at the end of my first semester. It was a plan from before we had begun dating, but he had been away from his family a year before that and they had planned to bring him back home. He told me that before we met nothing was keeping him here, and that he'd come back as soon as the next semester ended. 


Things didn't go well once he was gone. He ended up running into an ex about a month after he left. I didn't have a car, and couldn't afford to get across the country to visit him while attending school. He was stuck in the same situation, with his family urging him to stay close to home. He never claimed to be good at long distance, and during a nightly phone call he told me that he cheated, right before he told me we should end things.


I was heartbroken, this being the first serious relationship I'd had since moving into the city. Amanda tried to comfort me, but for weeks I was in despair. I felt like I should have tried harder to see him, that maybe if we hadn't been apart for so long things would have been different. 


One day Amanda broke through my despair with an idea. Someone had told her about a business that helps people get over breakups. She didn't know much about it, so she sent a message to her friend to ask about it. She received a link to a form as a response. 


The form didn't have a header stating the name of the business, and I didn't see it anywhere else. The questions were strangely personal, and I wasn't sure I wanted to give out all that information. Amanda knew it all anyways, and she quickly filled out the form and sent it to the email that was listed at the bottom. 


I tried telling Amanda that I was really uncomfortable sending all that information to strangers, but she assured me that her friend wouldn't have told her about a business that would rip us off. I shrugged in defeat, she had already sent the email anyways. 


Nothing came of it until a few days later, when I received an invitation in the mail. It was for myself and a plus one, so Amanda excitedly volunteered to join me. The invitation itself was odd, but it was obviously from the business that Amanda had emailed. 


*Miss Rebecca Wesley,*


*You and one guest are invited to a formal three course dinner in honor of your recent departure from a romantic relationship.* 


*Please dress accordingly, a vehicle will be at your place of residence at 7pm today.*


Of course, I was concerned by all the information they had-- my home address being part of that-- but Amanda was excited to see what this business could do for me. We got dressed up and met a sleek car in front of our building at exactly 7. 


It was dark, and the windows were tinted to an extent that was likely illegal. I couldn't tell where we were going. Amanda chattered excitedly, but I was faintly worried that something was wrong with all of this. We arrived at a building that blended into the plain surroundings, we could have been anywhere. 


A man escorted us inside, which was far more impressive than the exterior. It appeared to be an incredibly high-class restaurant, and we were escorted to a table for two. Next to our table a small TV screen was set into the wall, but it was blank at that time. 


A waiter came over as soon as we sat down, he handed us each a small menu and asked for our phones. They weren't permitted so that they could guarantee privacy for their clients. It seemed reasonable, and we handed over our electronics. It almost explained the secrecy over the location as well. I could understand people wanting the extent of their misery over a breakup to be kept private.


Upon opening the menu we discovered that we really didn't have any options. There was one selection for each course. When the waiter returned I questioned him about it, and he informed us that the menu was there merely so that we knew what we would be eating.


I wouldn't even know how to begin to spell the foreign names I read, but I believe everything was named something in French. It all sounded strange and exotic, and I found myself a bit excited at the prospect of an elaborate meal. Amanda agreed, there was no point in being worried over dinner since we had no way to tell what it was before it arrived anyways. 


Elaborate it was, I have no idea how to even identify or describe the flavors I tasted. There were sauces, meats, vegetables, and things that I had couldn't even begin to categorize. It was decadent, and by dessert I was nearly stuffed. Everything had been so delicious, I was actually starting to appreciate Amanda's effort to help me get over my ex. 


Two small bowls of ice cream were placed on our table, both covered in what appeared to be an assortment of fruit, nuts, chocolates, and syrups. It looked just as delicious as the rest of the meal had. The waiter told us to enjoy, and suddenly the screen next to us turned on. 


When I registered what was on the screen I was surprised, it was my ex. The screen appeared to be paused during a video of him speaking. Instantly I was nervous, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to keep myself from crying if I heard his voice. I stared down at my dessert, picking off a shaving of some sort of fruit. I nibbled at the fruit piece, worried that the video would start if I glanced back at the screen. I focused on the flavor, it was bitter and tough to chew. It didn't seem very sweet, and I assumed I had only gotten the peel of the fruit. It tasted much better when I tried it mixed with the rest of my dessert. 


Amanda noticed my silence but didn't say anything, instead she quietly ate her dessert as well. A few bites in the video started abruptly, and my exs voice filled the space. 


*Hi, I'm Matthew Hambleton. Recently I made a horrible mistake, and I've been given the chance to make up for it.* 


I stared at the screen as Matthew seemed to look at someone off camera, he nodded before continuing. 


*I fell in love with a girl, and it ended with me breaking her heart. I didn't want to do that to her, she was honestly my entire world-- she still would be if I hadn't fucked up* 


There were tears in my eyes as he cleared the emotion from his throat, and I shovelled my dessert in faster. I couldn't understand how this was going to make me feel better.


*Sorry.. That's not the point. I'm here to admit what I've done, beg for forgiveness, maybe even hope that you'll take me back in the end. I'll do anything to make this up to you Rebecca.*


The true tears came when he said my name, and Amanda put her arm around me as Matthew described his mistake" in complete detail. His parents pressuring him to leave me, friends and family alike urging him to go back to his ex, urging him to stay home and start a family there. He revealed everything, up to the morning that his ex woke him up with a kiss, and when he realized she also happened to be half naked Well, we all know what happened. 


He was pressured, he was seduced, he felt awful, and none of that made me feel any better. I felt nothing but a deep ache in my chest by the time he ended the video.


*That's the truth. It will always be my biggest regret, and I'm going to do everything I can to get you back Rebecca. I swear I'll make this right.*


I sat in my seat and cried. I was miserable, my dessert was gone, and the person I was in love with still wanted to fix my broken heart. I couldn't imagine what he could do that would fix anything, it all seemed like such a lost cause. What was stopping him from doing this all over again? He was a good guy, but there was so much negative pressure in his life. He was the one who left me after all, though I might have made the choice myself if I was given time to process.


Amanda gave me a small smile and a squeeze as the video ended, then slid over her half finished dessert. I took the silent offer, and continued trying to drown my feelings in the sugary dish. 


Another video started playing on the screen, and I steeled myself for more heart-rending messages created to give me closure. 


The video started with the camera being set up in a room with a concrete floor. Everything was clean, the walls white, and the lights bright. The camera panned over to a previously unseen corner of the room, where a man sat latched to a surgical table. 


Several doctors enter the room, surgical masks and gloves already in place. Not a word was spoken by the surgeons throughout the video, but they handed around a sheet of paper that seemed to be a list. 


The man on the table apparently was undergoing this procedure without anesthetic, since he started screaming when the scalpel touched his skin. 


I looked to Amanda in shock, *what is this?* She said nothing, and we both couldn't help but turn back to the screen. 


We watched in morbid awe as the surgeons removed sections of fat and muscle from the stomach and thighs of the man. The camera would zoom in at those parts, so that you saw in explicit detail as the scalpel sliced neatly between layers of flesh. 


The man screamed in agony, but whatever words he was trying to get out were unintelligible through his pain. Around the time that they opened up his midsection, he passed out. They removed what I believe was a kidney, then closed him up. 


I was still confused about seeing this, other than the man being awake this seemed to be an expertly done surgery. I absently picked at a fruit peel that was stuck between my teeth while the video continued, and took a horrifying turn. 


The surgeons had all his other wounds closed, the monitors showed everything to be going great, and that's when they did an amputation. The camera was painfully close as the scalpel moved between the mans thighs, and his body twitched when it made contact with his tender area. He remained unconscious, but not for long.


He screamed in the most agonizing way, a sound full of true pain and despair. The surgeons ignored the sounds, and expertly removed his appendage and stopped the bleeding. Once it was removed one of the surgeons brought a mask to the patient's face, his head fell back within moments once the relief of medication hit him. 


The screen cut to black for a moment, but it wasn't over. I didn't look away, but I was confused. It was a slideshow of pictures, all in a kitchen. It showed different ingredients being prepared and cooked. The images flashed by quickly, but something had caught my eye. It was familiar but I didn't have time to pinpoint it. The slideshow ended with a picture of each complete dish, all of which we'd eaten that evening. 


I gave a concerned glance in Amanda's direction, but a voice came from the TV before she noticed. I looked back to see Matthew, lying in a hospital bed. He was in tears.


*I know.. It was too much, I didn't know what they were planning. I just wanted to help you. I'm so sorry Rebecca, I hope you can forgive me even after this*


I was dumbfounded for a moment, and then the slideshow replayed. Slower. 


I soaked it in. A familiar looking piece of meat being seasoned, a strange organ being sliced into strips and sauteed, a fleshy looking object being delicately skinned by an apple peeler. I felt sick. 


The video ended and the waiter was suddenly there, before he could say anything I demanded to speak to someone in charge. I was repulsed, I couldn't believe the conclusion my mind came to. 


The woman in charge wasn't much help when I accused her of torturing people. She assured me that contracts and fine print went a long way in this world, and that if I had a complaint this place would disappear within hours. I didn't know how to respond, but she filled the moment of silence.


Which dish did you enjoy the most? It's usually the dessert, they do say that revenge is a dish best served cold, she smiled at that, before turning and walking away. 


I tried to go after her, to scream about how I didn't want vengeance in the first place, but a set of burly men drug both Amanda and I out. We screamed and tried to fight back, we were outraged at what we saw, but it was to no avail. We were shoved into the back of the car we had arrived in, and it sped off as soon as the doors closed. 


I cried into Amanda's arms throughout the drive, we whispered about how this was surely the end. I was almost relieved when the car stopped and the door opened, the first thing I saw was the hospital sign. We crawled out of the car as fast as possible, and flinched away from the man who stood outside the vehicle. 


He did nothing except toss our phones on the ground in front of us, then got back into the car and sped away. 


That was our last interaction with that business. We found Matthew in the hospital, he had no idea how to track down who had done this. He had no memory of the surgery, or anything that had happened after he filmed his apology video. Amanda has tried to find the emails, but they're entirely gone. We have no way to catch the people who did this. 


Matthew is still in the hospital, it's been about two weeks from the incident. He's missing a kidney and a fleshy sword, but he's healing really well. I visit him every day, and I feel horrible that I caused this. Somehow, he still wants to be with me, and I'm more than willing to work on things after all he lost for me.


Plus.. I know it's wrong, but I just can't help having this reoccurring thought. 


He can't cheat on me this time.

<TEXT> Every night at exactly 11:45pm my dog barks at my neighbor. He gets home from work at the same time each night, and it's been this way for the year that I've lived in this neighborhood. It bothered me the first few weeks, but eventually I grew used to it. It's kind of comforting to know that the old man next door is home for the night. 


He was a nice man, my parents quickly befriended him. They had helped me move in my meagre possessions last year, and they ended up sparking a conversation with the neighbor while he checked his mail. 


His name was James Barton, and he'd lived in that house his entire life. He was the same age as my father, and apparently they had graduated high school together. They hadn't been friends back then, but James said he thought he recognized my parents. My mother graduated two years later, so they would still have been attending at the same time. 


My parents didn't recognize James, but he seemed like a great guy. My mother had planned to cook a nice family meal to celebrate my new home, and she invited James to join us for the housewarming. It was nice, there were laughs and pleasant conversation. James didn't speak a lot, but when he did it never ceased to bring out at least one smile. 


Over the last year James has attended a couple of our dinners, and we make pleasant small talk when we see each other outside. He's become great friends with my father, and often enough I think Dad visits me just as an excuse to make plans with James. It's nice though, I feel safe when my neighbor is around.


He's kept me informed about the neighborhood, about how to stay safe when I have to go to work or walk my dog. I didn't mention it to my parents, but often enough there was somewhere within ten blocks featured on the nightly news. They already thought the place was dangerous, but I didn't need them to reel me back home after I'd only just decided to make it on my own. More than enough people survive bad neighborhoods.



My dog, Jade, loves our neighbor. She's always excited when he's around, and he always had treats because he had his own dog as well. His dog was a small lap dog, nothing like my larger Pitbull-Mastiff mix. His little Smokey was cute at least, but definitely not my type of dog. 


Jade was not only strong and protective of me, but she seemed to just be the perfect dog. She kept me safe and in good company, an ideal pet for a woman in her early twenties. She knew the daily routine, and she was smart. My dog was part of the reason that my parents agreed to let me use my savings to move into this one bedroom bungalow. The rent was relatively cheap, and it was close to where I worked, but it was in the bad part of town.


I think my parents were put slightly at ease about the neighborhood once they saw it didn't look entirely destroyed, and having a friendly neighbor nearby in case of an emergency was a plus. I was happy, finally out on my own and working towards building my life. For the longest time I felt entirely safe, as though nothing could get to me through my neighbor and dog. 


Things in the neighborhood could be crazy, what with the news of a supposed serial killer roaming the city, and the sheer amount of criminal activity that surrounded this area on a regular basis. I kept to myself for the most part, made friends with a few neighbors and James. Some of the people are odd, but James was never one of them. The oddest thing about James was something he often mumbled to himself.


Sometimes, after we'd have a conversation I'd hear Mister Barton talking to himself quietly. Usually it was nonsense, some small tangent of a memory replaying in his head because of something we'd spoken about. I think that I must have reminded him of someone, because I heard one phrase quite often after we spoke.


*Too close to home.*


He sometimes seemed sad after we spoke to each other, and sometimes I felt bad that I may be triggering a painful memory from his past. He was my best friend in the neighborhood though, since so many of the other neighbors were *creepy*, they all seemed to blend into the shady environment we lived in. My dog kept me safe from them, and so did Mister Barton. 



One night I stopped feeling so safe. I was dancing around my kitchen, music playing and water set to boil on the stove. It was dark, but my house seemed warm and cozy. The kitchen light was bright and it made it hard to see out the windows, but I knew Jade was somewhere sniffing around our small backyard. It was nearly midnight, and I'd been advised by multiple neighbors to avoid walking the streets alone around here. Sure, Jade is pretty tough, but a gun can always beat a dog. 


So Jade was confined to the yard until she commenced her nightly ritual of barking at Mister Barton's car when he pulled in. Those were actually the only times I ever let her out in the small yard instead of going for a walk. The barking didn't happen though, I put the pasta in the pot, skipped to the next song in my playlist, and then noticed the time. It was a few minutes after midnight, and Jade hadn't barked. I walked into the small living room to look out the window and see if Mister Barton's car was there, but it wasn't. I figured he must be late, and decided to leave Jade outside until I had eaten. 


I strained, served, and ate my midnight meal, but still hadn't heard any barking. When I went to the back door to let Jade in I found her staring into Mister Barton's yard, just standing still and looking at the lawn. There was nothing there that I could see. It took a minute before she noticed me calling and came lumbering in the house, but she stopped and looked back at his yard as she got to the door. I stared into the yard, then picked up a stone and threw it at the chain fence. 


Several birds flew from the overgrown grass of my neighbors yard, and I was satisfied with the result. Jade had been transfixed on them. There was no barking at all that night. Jade wasn't a loud dog, she only barked when a stranger came near the doors of the house or when Mister Barton got home. Neither of those things happened. 


Over the next few days I found myself bored, Mister Barton wasn't around to talk to while I was outside. I tried to occupy the free time, but things were odd without the usual presence. We lived in a part of the country with fair weather pretty much year round, and I tried to fix up my backyard to deal with the boredom. 


I'd cleaned out the yard months ago, like nearly every other yard in the neighborhood it had been full of junk. I remember the days I spent cleaning out the yard fondly, because occasionally Mister Barton would see me and help. He was always good conversation while we got rid of useless items left behind by old renters.


Sometimes I'd see him planting things in his yard while I was busy, but it never ceased to look like a jungle. His grass was tall and overgrown, plants and flowers grew at random. It was pretty in a natural way, and that's exactly how James Barton had wanted it. 


I'd asked him once if he wanted me to mow his lawn, but he declined the offer. 


This space is the one place that holds true, natural freedom. It belongs this way, he had spoken with a smile on his face, his eyes seeming lost in a memory. 


After a two days of working in my yard alone I couldn't take it, I felt so alone and unsafe in the neighborhood. My dog was too quiet, my neighbor had disappeared, and I resorted to stoning birds. It was my only way to fight back against my growing paranoia about the dangerous location I resided in.


Occasionally I have enough spare change to have some recreational fun, and with my neighbor being gone I found myself able to freely have such fun. I didn't want my smoking habit to get back to my parents, so I usually kept it to my bedroom when I needed to. With my neighbor being gone I was free to sit on the cracked concrete ledge that my landlord dared to call a patio. 


So that's what I did, I sat in my yard. A stoned girl throwing rocks at the birds who landed in the yard next door. I'd stare at the yard and wonder if James Barton was dead, buried in a cemetery under flowers that were arranged neatly. I felt like he'd rather let his grave become overgrown, hidden among natural beauty. 


I didn't like thinking that way though. He was the same age as my parents, only in his mid-fifties. I didn't like knowing that someone that age could suddenly drop without a warning, Mister Barton couldn't be dead. 


It was four days after my dog stopped barking, a warm morning. I got up, got dressed, poured a coffee, and put Jade on the leash for her morning walk. We walked to the mailbox where I stood and looked through my mail, and then Jade whimpered. I looked to her, then to the driveway she was staring at. Mister Barton's car was back.


I was excited, I wanted to know the reason behind his sudden absence. I went and knocked on his door, Jade jumping around excitedly at my feet. No one answered, and I left to take Jade on her walk after several minutes of waiting. Perhaps he was asleep.


After work I knocked again, only to find the same thing. I was disappointed. He had been gone for days, but it seemed that I would have to wait to figure out why. Before dinner I sat in my yard and smoked, the sun was setting. All the lights in Mister Barton's house were off, and it still felt empty to me. 


I threw stones at the birds and watched a cluster fly up and circle overhead, I felt myself make a face of disgust-- I hated birds flying over my head. I watched as they came back down, and for some reason it sent a chill through me. My friend and neighbor had been replaced by a flock of beady eyed creatures. Maybe it was because I smoked too much, but the birds made me feel afraid. What if they were mad about the rocks? 


I shut myself into the house for the night, planning on discussing the birds with Mister Barton the next day. I didn't want them to hurt the garden he loved so much. Unfortunately the next morning was the same as the last, and I found myself spending another few days wondering why Mister Barton was avoiding me.


Sunday came along, and with it brought my parents. They asked about Mister Barton, apparently my father had been trying to get in touch and make plans. I told them what I knew, and my mother took it upon herself to knock at his door. She received the same response as I did, and we all questioned the strange behavior of James Barton over dinner. 


Another few days of smoke, stones, birds, and dogs that didn't bark. That's when the woman who lived on the other side of James Barton called someone. She had noticed the car remain still, and the mail overflow from its box. She was concerned, worried that the old man might be trapped in his home and hurt. I hadn't thought of it that way, I had taken the first part of his absence heavily into consideration and assumed that it was all connected, which made it seem like he was avoiding everyone.


They didn't find an injured Mister Barton, but they found many other things. They found Smokey, Mister Bartons small terrier-mix. I was horrified when I heard the news, someone had actually strangled the dog. I still can't understand how anyone could be so cruel. 


Someone at the scene noticed the curious amount of scavenger birds circling the backyard, and it wasn't long until they decided to look deeper. Deeper as in, they dug up the overgrown yard. They destroyed the wild beauty and revealed organized decay. Neat rows of bodies were buried in the yard, most of which have been identified as people who were suspected victims of a local serial killer. 


One body in particular stood out, the body of James Barton. James Barton, who had lived in the house next to mine for his entire life, who had attended the same high school as my parents. James Barton, who still kept the yearbook from his senior year in his house, the same year that my father graduated. James Barton, who should have looked familiar to my parents, because he was actually on the football team with my father. James Barton, who was murdered in his home and buried in his backyard. James Barton, who had his identity stolen. 


I've seen pictures of the real James Barton since then, and the imposter was quite accurate in his impersonation. The true James had been dead around three years, and the man I knew had kept his cover all that time. The person who had made me feel safe in an unsafe place happened to be the most dangerous person possible. 


They haven't found the imposter. He seems to have moved on to his next set of victims, or maybe into permanent hiding. If you're a young woman in your early twenties, then you match the type of victim that he seems to favor. When I heard the description of his victims it made my blood run cold, and sent a wave of realization through me.


I understood what he meant when he walked away from me muttering under his breath.


*Too close to home.*

<TEXT> The most memorable one I remember seeing when I was around 7, the Amityville Horror remake had just come out and I was watching it in the living room with my parents. That was followed by some horror movie about werewolves that I fell asleep after. Woke up in the middle of the night terrified and thinking the dead girl was in the house.

The first one though, was a few of the nightmare on elm Street movies. My parents sent me to a friend's house when I was fine or six, he was a few years older so he picked the movies.   </TEXT>

I have no idea how it relates at all to the final outcome of things, but it was just something that occurred in such perfect timing that I assumed it must be related.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once a world of black and white 

Now a plane of greys

Gone is all the vibrant light 

Missing sun-bright rays

Things are dim

Numbness sets in 

Playing a game that I cannot win 

I'll say sorry every time 

I'll let you hurt me 

I'll accept your lies 

I'm sorry, my dear 

It's all my fault 

Sorry for my tears 

I can't help that they fall 

I wish I was better 

I'm doing everything wrong 

I try to be enough 

But I guess I'm not strong 

Strong like you, 

The fighter, the yeller

My love, it's true

I'd let you love me black and blue 

I'm in love

It's not fair

Yes it hurts

I don't care 

I'm sure I will 

One day

I'll have my regrets 

Things could get better

But I'm nearly faithless

I want things to be fine 

I want things to be right 

But my hope fades more

Every time that we fight

I'm sorry, I'm sorry 

For bringing it up 

I'm sorry for staying 

I'm just trying to be enough

<TITLE> I Shouldn't Have Tried Crystal Pepsi </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-03 04:07:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Remember a while ago when there was some big thing about people having Crystal Pepsi? I don't remember exactly when, or what the big deal was, but I remember when my friend offered me a can. 


Apparently his dad had several cases sitting in his work shed.


Now the thing about my friend Dominic is that his parents are *weird.* It was a little off-putting. His mother collected porcelain dolls and fancy plates. His father collected soda merchandise and coins. They were really intense about their collections, but they were never ones to waste money. 


I don't think anyone else in the neighborhood had near the same amount of savings as the Price family. They were extremely responsible with their money, and weren't against selling valuable pieces of their collections. They both worked steady, well paying jobs, and they lived in a house well below their means. They didn't spend frivolously just because they could, they planned to have a nice sum to guide them through retirement. 


Dominic Price wasn't as serious as his parents though. Part of why we were friends was his amazing sense of humor, he was one of the funniest people I knew. He was adventurous, and throughout the years we'd gotten into all sorts of trouble together. We were infamous among the neighborhood.


That's besides the point though, because on this day all our infamous duo was doing was taking one can of Crystal Pepsi from one of the many cases that were stacked in the back corner of the work shed. 


To keep a short story short, we drank a can in the shed. It tasted weird, and it was just a general waste of time. There was one interesting thing I noticed in the shed while we looked around, it was an old keychain with the Pepsi logo on it. It was pretty cool looking. 


Dom suddenly picked up the keychain and tossed it at me, Want it? Dad's got a million, he'll never notice. 


I nodded and pocketed the keychain as we left. I knew I shouldn't have taken it, but I did anyways. It was almost like it was a gift from Dom. Anyways, I walked out with a neat trinket, and Dom finished off the gross pop. I didn't think much of our little shed escapade, except to worry that Mr. Price would find out and be upset. 


It was a week later when I sat down with the Price family for dinner, and my anxiety over being caught was validated.


Have you two been in my work shed recently? Mr. Price spoke casually, as though he was used to people entering his shed without permission.


I looked to Dominic for his reply, because I had no idea if we planned on telling the truth. 


Yea, we tried out one of the Crystal Pepsi's last weekend, he admitted.


His father nodded, and asked that we get permission before going into his shed. The rest of dinner went smoothly, but I couldn't help but still feel nervous that Mr. Price knew about what I'd taken. 


When I left the house that night I could swear Mr. Price glared at me as we said goodbye. I didn't sleep well that night. I brushed it off as guilt over the petty theft, but the sounds freaked me out. I kept hearing a noise which sounded like someone pacing outside my bedroom window. 


Over the next week I wished my room was located on a higher floor, because I swore that something was outside. It tapped and scratched at my window, and several nights I saw a silhouette standing out on the lawn. I was afraid, I thought that maybe Mr. Price was trying to scare me into a confession. 


If that was the case, it worked. I showed up at their home on a Saturday afternoon, but Dom was out. I admitted that I was actually there to see Mr. Price. We walked into his living room together, and each sat in a chair. I pulled the keychain from my pocket.


I'm sorry Mr. Price, I took this from your shed a few weeks ago, I spoke nervously, rushing to get the words out. 


I know, and you kept it from me. You lied about what you took from my shed, his voice was low and stern, it sent a wave of fear through me.


I-Im sorry, I stuttered out the apology, in no place to correct him on exactly who had told the lie. 


Listen, his tone softened, I normally wouldn't care about a small theft, but this thing is cursed.


I stared at him for a moment, waiting for the punchline to this joke. He remained calm and serious, so I just nodded at his statement. Mr. Price was weirder than I'd thought. 


There's something inside it, he continued, but quickly broke into a fit of laughter, I'm sorry, it's just you almost seemed to believe it. This thing does have a history of being stolen, but that's all. 


I was confused, and honestly didn't find the joke very funny after the week I'd had. I was polite as possible for the rest of the conversation, and left as soon as I could. As I was leaving I heard Mr. Price call out a final statement to me.


Returning it doesn't change the fact that it was stolen, and that you lied to my face.


I was stepping out the front door as he said it, I turned to apologize once more but his wife closed the door in my face.


I thought the weird noises and strange figures would go away once I returned the keychain, but nothing changed. I spent another week nearly sleepless before I found myself back at Dom's house for dinner. 


His mother let me in and led me to the table, Dom was already seated and nodded towards me in a greeting. Mrs. Price left to go to the kitchen, and Mr. Price sat imposingly at the head of the table. There was an odd tension in the air, and I felt uncomfortable sitting there. I noticed that the table hadn't been set, which made me realize how unusual it was for everyone to be seated for dinner so early.


When Mrs. Price came back into the room she was holding a hammer, and her husband suddenly stood. I sat in shock as they walked over to me. I wasn't expecting the hammer to slam down on the hand Id left resting on the table. I heard the crunch of bone before I screamed. It was the worst pain I'd ever felt, and I was too shocked to move. 


The hammer came down a few more times, landing squarely on each of my knuckles. I flinched each time I heard my bones breaking, but by the last one I wasn't sure if I could feel it. My right hand was a useless, mangled mess. 


Mrs. Price gripped my shoulders as her husband moved away from me. She wasn't very big or imposing, but she was strong enough to keep me in place while I groaned in agony. I don't think I could have moved very much if she hadn't been holding me, the pain was intense. 


I wanted more than anything to leave, but I couldn't understand why Dom hadn't moved from his seat. That's when Mr. Price pull his son's seat away from the table, and I saw that his hands were bound. 


In some places, the punishment for stealing is very costly, Mr. Price smiled, you two are lucky. 


I stared in disbelief as held the hammer above Dom's hand. That was the moment when Mrs. Price leaned close and whispered to me.


*Run, don't tell anyone what you saw. There's a similar punishment for spreading rumors, she giggled at that, and it sent a chill through my body, No one would believe it either.* 


She gave me a slight shove, and I ran out of the room as the first of Dom's screams rang out. The street was busy, loud. I couldn't hear any screams once I was outside, but I still ran. I ran until I got home, feeling guilty for leaving Dom. They were his parents though, and I was a skinny teenager. I didn't know how to help. 


When I got home my parents were waiting for me, they weren't surprised by my bloody hand. They received a call from Mr. Price where he explained that I had gotten into a fight with Dominic. Today was the day they had planned on moving out of the state, and according to Mr. Price I was mad that no one had told me they were leaving. 


My parents were disappointed in me, assuming my broken knuckles were from a wall I had supposedly put a hole through at the Price home. We went to the hospital about it, and even the doctor told them that it didn't appear to be caused by punching something. They didn't really acknowledge it, too deep in their acceptance of what Mr. Price had said. He was their friend, a fellow parent in the neighborhood, of course they trusted them. 


Dominic wasn't in school on Monday, and when I walked by the Price house at the end of the day it appeared empty. I steeled myself and walked up to the door, knocking softly. No answer. I peeked in a window and found the house devoid of furniture. They really had moved away. 


It's been years since then, but I've never found a trace of them. I don't know why they believed in such severe punishment I for theft, or why someone was outside of my home. Maybe thinking I'd tell my parents and make myself less credible in the end? Regardless, no one has ever believed my side of the story. The only reason I even thought to tell anyone about this is because I found something in an old jacket of mine today. 


It was an old Pepsi keychain that I *know* I returned.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Usually, when a person describes a day using the metaphor *worst day of my life*, they've had a rough day. Be it due to work, an embarrassing moment, a regrettable choice, or a tragic event, some days seem to deserve this title. Of course, it's usually exaggerated, but everyone is guaranteed to experience the worst day of their lives at some point. The issue is, there's only one day that exists where it's accurate to label it that way, and almost no one alive has experienced it yet.


After all I've been through, I've realized how casually we throw around the title of *Worst Day Ever*. Prior to the recent events, the worst day of my life was easy to recall. 


I was young, and admittedly not the most attentive to the feelings of others. You can't always expect great things from 17 year old boys. I thought I was a pretty sensitive guy, I was nice at least, and I'd never had any issue with another student. I had my few close friends, and everyone else I was just friendly towards. For the most part, high school held minimal teenaged drama for me.


Then came the second half of senior year, where Prom and Graduation sat happily waiting mere weeks away. At the time my friend group had narrowed down to only the two people I was closest to, and senior year was amazing for us. We drove around on late night adventures together, wandered the woods at the edge of town, and attended every party that would have us. 


Most of or party attendance was a few minutes where one of us would grab a bottle of liquor from the kitchen, while the other two spoke to the party host. In less than ten minutes we'd be in and out of a party, and off to spend our Saturday nights drinking stolen bottles by the creek in the woods. It was Ashley, Riley and I, the three musketeers. 


Ashley was one of those girls who didn't get along well with other girls. She wasn't exactly a tom-boy, but she'd rather not deal with all the drama that groups of girls seemed to be clouded in. We became friends in our sophomore year, after she tore apart some guy in our English class. He had been spouting random nonsense about how everyone on Welfare was a lowlife, and she ran up one side of him and down the other over his ignorant claims. She was pretty outspoken when she was annoyed at someone. 


We were fast friends, without any of us really having to say it. Riley and I had lived down the street from one another since birth, but didn't realize we had a lot in common until middle school. Ashley may have been a few years late into the friendship, but from the first day we had lunch together it was like she had always been there. She accepted two random boys sitting with her at the lunch table without question, and spoke to us like we were already old friends. 


It was perfect, it was easy, and I couldn't ask for better friends. Then I went and ruined it. I could go on and on about the great times we all had, but the biggest event in that friendship was not a happy one. That's my fault though, it should have been the best night of our high school careers. 


Now, I don't mean to sound cocky or anything, but the three of us were an attractive group. We'd each had our fair share of relationships throughout school, but two weeks before prom hit we found Riley to be the only one in a relationship. Since Ashley and I couldn't lock down dates who actually *wanted* to go, she asked if we could go together. It was a platonic thing of course, we'd been friends for so long.


The big thing about it was that Ashley *really* wanted to go to prom. She had gotten an expensive dress and shoes when her ex had asked her months ago, but his way of breaking up with her was publicly asking another girl to prom. Very publicly-- as in, he did it during the middle of an assembly in front of the entire school. She was devastated considering they had been together for a year, but she thought going to the dance would prove something. I agreed, honestly in the last three years she had become a better friend to me than Riley. He had been slightly hard to track down since senior year began and he started dating a girl named Leslie. 


So that was the plan, I'd go to prom with Ashley so that she could look amazing in front of everyone who saw her huge embarrassment two months prior. The only issue with the plan was that I was late.


Prom was on a Saturday, and I had a plan for my friends and I. I woke up later than expected, nearly 2pm. I had more than enough time to arrive by 7. Riley and Leslie were taking a limo-- the perks of having well-off parents-- and Ashley was going to be arriving with them. I told them I'd meet them there. 


I had a plan to make a little after-party for the four of us, at our favorite spot. I spent the day collecting the things we'd need, and setting things up at the location. By the time I was finished it was just after 7, I was already late. Thankfully I had preordered our tickets, so Ashley could get in without me. I felt bad for being late, and I planned to head directly over to the prom. That's what I did, but there was a distraction.


I got a phone call on my way, which I answered while driving, a quick glance showed my ex-girlfriends face on the screen.


Sabrina? 


Um.. I'm sorry, I know it's late, but are you busy? She sounded nervous through the phone.


It's not that late, I'm just driving, I told her.


Oh, well that's the thing. Do you think you could stop by and give me a ride to prom? My um.. my ride cancelled, She stumbled over the words, and I felt a little bad for her.


I agreed to stop by, it wouldn't be too far out of my way. If I'm honest, I missed her. We had broken up back before Christmas because she was somehow convinced that I'd never make the effort to see her once she left for college the next year. I felt awful over it because I had actually applied to the same schools as her so we could stay together, but it was supposed to stay a surprise until I learned if I had been accepted.


Let's just keep it short and sweet. I got to her house and she was still in her room, her mom has always been fond of me and sent me upstairs. In her bedroom I made a choice, and I didn't realize how important it was. I suppose she missed me as much as I missed her, because by the time we got in the car and left we were nearly two hours late to prom. Sabrina had told me on the ride that it was actually her date who had cancelled, but she didn't expect me to go with her since she had friends waiting. 


I was prepared to head into prom and give an embarrassing explanation to my friends about my tardiness, but it didn't happen quite like that. Sabrina left me as soon as we entered, immediately finding her friends. I roamed the room, looking for a glimpse of the deep red that Ashley had recently colored her hair. I saw Riley and Leslie dancing, but Ashley was nowhere in sight. I asked them if they had seen her, but they said she had disappeared a while ago.


It was nearly 10pm before we left to find her, she wasn't answering her phone and we couldn't find her anywhere in the building. We took my car, checking her house first, and assuring her parents that she had probably gone home with a friend. We searched everywhere obvious, before thinking of heading to our favorite spot in the world. It was around 10:30 when we got there. She had left prom less than two hours before.


We found her, at the creek where we all hung out. With the blankets I had brought earlier in the day set up in a nice spot to hangout, and battery powered lights tied to branches in the surrounding trees. Then there was the backpacks, filled with pop and snacks, and enough alcohol to fill a pool. The bags were open, and so were several bottles. The amount missing from each bottle varied, but it was more than enough for any single person. 


Then there was Ashley. Her floor length blue dress was soaked from the creek water, it made the dark color look nearly black. Her makeup ran haphazardly down her face, and she looked so sad and cold. I didn't know what to say, Leslie and Riley hadn't arrived yet. I didn't move towards her, I knew that this was all my fault. 


She was so still, her neck bent at an unnatural angle against a sharp rock in the creek. I saw the nearby plank of wood that we had used as a makeshift bridge, a piece had rotted through. I had just noticed that Ashley's shoes matched her dress when suddenly a hand grabbed my shoulder. Riley and Leslie broke me out of the trance, but I'll never forget finding her there.


When the official report came out, it wasn't surprising. She had a very high amount of alcohol in her system, her ankle was fractured, and her neck was broken.


I missed a lot by being late to prom, the night pieced together from other students memories. Like seeing Ashley fight with her exs date. She didn't fight though, she was attacked. Apparently this girl didn't take kindly to her date staring at his ex, Ashley had looked astounding at the dance. In the time before Ashley left, the girl managed to pour a drink down her back, and step on her dress so that it tore. No one noticed this escalating, and when she consulted a chaperone she was told that these were likely accidents in a crowded room. 


She got sick of it, she had spent so much money on a dress that was ruined, for a night that was ruined. Her ex and his friends laughed as she walked out. Then she went to our spot in the creek, and she found my plans for an after-party. She had the party alone, took a drunken walk in high heels, and twisted her ankle as she fell through rotted wood. She died alone when her neck snapped upon impact with a sharp rock. 


That day I found her, that was the worst day of my life. I shouldn't have been late, I could have kept her away from the things that made her leave the dance. I could have gone to the creek with her. I always knew it was a horrible decision that I made which led to her death, and the day was never forgotten. This is probably as close as anyone has ever been to feeling like the kid from *Bridge to Terabithia*. 


Years have gone by, I've tried putting the past behind me. I did end up getting back together with Sabrina, she helped comfort me after Ashley's death. Life has been going fine, I feel like I've made all the right choices since that day. Finishing college, getting a job, marrying Sabrina, having a baby. It's been almost 11 years since Ashley died, and I've almost gotten past the guilt. 


I have been very conscious about my choices for the past 11 years, I didn't want to carelessly cause any harm. That's what everyone does, right? We all make the best choices we can to help ourselves without hurting too many others. The thing is, you never really know how many choices you've made that caused unnecessary harm. 


So there I was, 28 and believing my life was wonderful, other than one choice I made as a kid. I had a decent paying job, and the apartment we live in is a mere 25 minute walk away. I don't mind the walk, it's a good time to destress. That's what I was doing when a stranger suddenly fell into step with me, when I glanced over to see who had come so close I only caught a glimpse of *something* before it sped up and walked ahead of me. 


Trying to think about it I can't think of how to describe what I saw. I'd say that it was like seeing nothing, the absence of air around a space which contained an unseeable object, but that wasn't quite it. I knew something was there, but it was hard to see or focus on. Not like it was nothing, but like it was *everything*. It was all that surrounded us, displayed in such a way that it blended almost seamlessly with the street around me. I'm sorry if that doesn't make much sense, but you'll know what I mean when you encounter it. 


It seemed to disappear once it was a few steps ahead of me, and I felt confused about what I had just experienced. I thought about what it could have been, and ended up assuming it was some sort of side effect from being stressed out. I assumed it was something I'd imagined, and my walk went along as normal. I reached the entrance to the path through the park and stopped.


It was dark, but there were still a fair amount of people walking through the streets and the park. The path I stared at was wide and made of stone, trees lined the sides and the foliage overhead made the path appear like a dark tunnel into a haunted forest, but it was actually kind of beautiful. I walked through this path every night, but tonight I saw two men who appeared to be arguing.


Not wanting to walk by the argument, I decided to go around the park. It would add ten minutes to my trip, but I didn't mind. As I took my first steps away from the park I felt it, that *thing*-- the one made of everything and nothing-- was beside me again. Then I heard a whisper that sounded like hundreds of child-like voices at once.


*Every choice has a consequence, don't forget.* 


Then suddenly the feeling was gone, but the whispers seemed to echo through my head. I stood still for a moment before taking another step forward, a step that felt deeply *wrong.* The thought popped into my head forcefully, *go the usual way.* I paused again, standing still to think. *Maybe theyre done fighting.* 


I don't know why it had felt so wrong to try and avoid the park, but I decided to listen to that instinct. I felt better as I stepped towards the park, but that was a short-lived feeling. 


There were two distinct sounds as I stepped onto the stone pathway. One was the sound of a man groaning in pain, and the other was whispering children.


*Too late.* 


I stared down the pathway, at a man lying in a puddle of blood. Of course the police were called, I had to give my statement-- which wasn't very helpful at all-- and the man who had been stabbed was being sent to the hospital. I was talking to him before they took him to the ambulance, he told me something that brought me back to the feelings I'd had when Ashley died.


He was old, maybe 50, and I wasn't sure if he would live until the authorities arrived. I tried to help, and he thanked me for it. Then he apologized, because this was his fault. He thought it would be smart to bring a knife to defend himself against a debt collector, but it was used against him. The part that made me feel awful? He told me that he wished I'd gotten to the park sooner, because he wouldn't have pulled the knife if someone else had been in the park.


I didn't know what I was supposed to do with that information, but I decided to keep it to myself that I had actually seen them fighting and walked away. I felt awful when the ambulance left, and when I was told I was alright to leave I stewed over it. A man might have been spared several punctures if I had changed one simple decision. A decision that shouldn't matter at all in the grand scheme of things. My walking route shouldn't have been such a large factor in whether that old man bled out in the park or not. 


I was almost out of the park, but I sat down on a bench to clear my head. I had already sent a text to Sabrina explaining that there had been some trouble at the park and I would be getting home late. I didn't want to bring such a heavy weight when I walked in the door, I felt guilty. I shouldn't have, it could have happened to anyone. 


I almost didn't notice when the strange *thing* sat next to me. The whispers came back then.


*Every choice has a consequence.*


I spoke aloud to the odd space next to me, I don't understand why you're here. 


I didn't want to dwell on the incident in the park, I already felt bad about it. I wanted to get straight to the most important issue, why was a creature like this suddenly following me? Of course I wanted to ask what it was, but there's really no polite way to ask that of an inhuman entity whom you've only just met.


*There are those who have made so many choices that appear to hold no consequences, so many times they picked an option they did not need to. You have done just that, and now we bring you one more choice. You may decide how you feel over all that you have caused.*


I sat there, completely astounded by what the voices of children were telling me. I could think of only two things that I'd done which held high consequences, surely there were people with a far greater collection of mistakes? I nodded in the general direction of the barely visible creature, entirely unsure of how to respond. 


There was a moment of silence, the kind that you never experience anywhere. There was no sound of traffic, no buzz of electricity, no voices, nothing. The air around me was entirely devoid of sound, and then I felt something touch my hand. Pins and needles shot up my arm, and the inside of my skull was shaken by a loud ringing noise. 


*How do you feel over the choices you've made?* The children still spoke in a whispering tone, but it sounded deafening inside my head. 


My vision faded into a blank white state, and I could think of only one word.


*Guilty.*


The feeling spread up my arm, and change from the pins and needles to knives and acid. It felt as though my flesh was melting off. There was a sudden flash of black, and I was numb. As though I was dreaming I watched several scenes play out. 


There I was, arriving at Sabrina's house. The entire night played out the same as it does in my memories, but then there are parts I didn't see.


I was a ghost, an invisible character in the lives of my friends. I watched as Riley and Lelsie went home after leaving the crime scene. I watched as they discussed how the death was partly my fault. Time skipped forward, to their decision that they couldn't be friends with a person like me, though we had all planned to go to college together they decided to go out of state instead. 


I watched as Riley grew distant with everyone throughout the months after Ashley died. I watched Leslie leave him out of frustration. I watched as he killed himself. It was about two years after Ashley's death, a year after we had fallen entirely out of touch. 


After watching Riley hang from the rafters of his garage, everything turned black again. The darkness lasted five seconds, but it felt like an eternity where the pain of my flesh falling from my bones returned. 


The scene flicked back to Sabrina at prom. Someone was telling her about the death. She was devastated. Skip forward a few days, and I discovered something I wish I'd known before I picked her up that night. It wasn't just her date that had cancelled on her, it was her boyfriend. 


This boyfriend had been told about someone else driving her to prom, and arriving so late. Things didn't go well for her there, and based on what I saw in my third person form she was used to it. After a few weeks of her taking it like a champ, he left her. She seemed shocked, but relieved. That was around the time she started to visit me and comfort me, but she never talked about her ex. 


That scene was short, I already knew what happened with Sabrina and I after prom. The darkness and pain returned tenflold. I hadn't realized how much my choice that day affected. A flash of white blinded me.


I was suddenly standing on Sabrina's front porch all dressed up. Her mother opened the door and I stared at her in confusion.


Daniel? Sabrina's still in her room if you want to go up, I have to leave in a moment, she smiled at me, seeming pleased that I was here for the first time in months. 


No, I'll wait here, I replied with a smile.


I was finding it hard to catch my breath though, was I honestly getting a chance to fix my mistakes? 


The night went on. Sabrina came downstairs and I drove her to the dance, she told me that we should hang out some time. I danced with Ashley, her ex stared. His date didn't come near my group of friends, we all spent the night happy. 


About an hour into the dance Sabrina's date barged in. He was obviously drunk, and everyone in the room witnessed as he grabbed Sabrina by the arm and tried to pull her out of the room. People stepped in, including myself, and we removed him from the building while Sabrina told him that they were through.


Time went on, I had a fun little after-party with my best friends, and Sabrina spent the night with her friends. We all graduated, we all went to the same college. I ran into Sabrina there, and we got back together. Everyone was happy, we all had our lives on track. The darkness returned. 


I'm sure I screamed out loud as the pain rocketed through my body, but I couldn't help it. When I opened my eyes I was staring at the odd entity on the park bench. My phone was vibrating in my pocket over and over, and I was very confused. 


*You should not be consumed by guilt over past choices. Too much guilt keeps you from being able to make better decisions in the future.* 


The child-like voices spoke in a way that sent a deep sense of dread through my body. I looked away from the creature to see why my phone hadn't stopped going off. 

It had been hours since I sat on this bench. So many missed calls, all from my wife. So many voicemails. I listened to one, forgetting that there was something inhuman sitting next to me. Something was wrong.


The voicemail shook me to my core, our daughter was missing. She thought maybe she had gone to the park to find me. I needed to get home now, I needed to find her. I stared at the creature, it stood as I hung up the phone. 


*Sometimes it's better to choose not to feel guilty, dwelling on mistakes wastes so much time,* the voices spoke softly before the creature stepped away, disappearing. 


I could swear I heard children laughing as I sprinted through the park, yelling my daughter's name. 


We haven't found her, it's been over a week. That day has taken up residence as the worst day of my life. The day where I got to see how horribly I ruined my friends lives 11 years ago, the day where I let my guilt keep me from choosing to run home. 


I could have run away, I could have been afraid of the inhuman thing and avoided it. I could have been spared the true worst day of my life. Instead I was enteanced from the moment those childish voices whispered about consequences, because I knew I hadn't faced any harsh enough for the wrong I'd done. 


What is the consequence of too may mistakes that go unpunished? Guilt. 


I think that's what I'd call the creature that visited me, Guilt. So, from me to you, here is some advice.


Don't let it get to you, don't let your guilt over the past cause you to choose wrong in the future. Don't choose to feel guilty when it comes for you, because it comes at a cost.

Apologies for not being specific, but this Snoo just needs to be easily identified as representing something creepy.

<TEXT> N.F * 

I feel like that's too obvious, no? 

Looking back through the posts from others, I've started paying more attention. Tyler got a scientific name, Alphaea got a Latin nickname, so I'm figuring rather than outright name me as a creature, it's something Latin and descriptive of whatever I am.

I've never hurt anyone else before, I'm not sure what could have happened in the hotel that would cause me to not remember acting out of sorts, if that's what happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A list would be helpful, but I'm not sure how the guests would feel if a list existed merely to make them easy to indentify. Perhaps such a thing exists though, I'll have to look deeper. 

Also, as far as I learned in my final interview, no one *really* applies to work here. If you find an advertisement or message that leads you to this place, it's not by chance. 

Someone, somewhere, pointed you out to the hotel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've actually heard a lot about the Irish and more modern lore on Fae/Fey/Faeries and it's quite interesting, I'll see if anyone at the hotel knows anything about this.

Obviously I'm not completely clueless, I have Tyler's post to guide me, shifts to work, and a hotel full of inhuman guests... Any of which could be related to me.

I wonder if it actually was my blood that caused the awareness of me being unnatural, or something else. 

I have no idea what type of creatures Rose and Mister Smith may be, but they both seemed to know that I was different when we met

So many questions, fortunately I have at least 3 months to find answers and piece it all together.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello creeps and creepettes, and a good afternoon, morning, evening, or night. Whatever time of day it may be, you seem to have found your way down a dark alley and into a strange and rarely seen place. Maybe it's rarely seen because you're one of the first few souls to even bring yourself into such an obscure corner. Eventually this corner may be frequented, and this message will have aged by then, but I'd like it to retain its relevance over time. 


Welcome reader, whether you be new or old. Whether you stumbled upon this sub by chance, or you followed a pale writer through the streets and cornered her here. Whether a fan of the work, or simply a curious onlooker questioning if this place is safe to enter. No matter who you may be, this is a fond greeting to you. Unless you happen to be an asshole for no apparent reason, then you can walk away now because I will not spare you the full extent of my wrath when I am annoyed. 


There are a few basic rules here, which can be found by [following this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/HylianHorror/about/rules/) or the link in the sidebar. Don't forget to brush up on your [rediquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) before you decide to take part in the community. We're just a peaceful group of people who enjoy cannibalism, nothing wrong with that.


Now for the rules, you'll find yourself at the mercy of myself and whatever other mods may be recruited in the future if you don't follow the guidelines for being a part of this little community. 


**Be Respectful.**


*It is never acceptable to degrade, disrespect, slander, or negatively criticize any user who posts or comments here. We do not allow spamming or trolling, and those who partake in these activities will face the maximum penalty that a mod can inflict.* 


*Constructive criticism about the stories linked in posts is welcome only on posts which state it is permitted. Not every post linking to a story is meant for readers to freely air their grievances with the content, and out of place comments such as these will be removed without a reply. If you wish for a reply, please comment on the appropriate post.* 


*There are times when other authors may be mentioned in posts, it is never appropriate to negatively criticize, disrespect, or act offensively in any way towards those users or the posts mentioning them.* 


**Remember that this is a place for discussion, not merely categorization.**


*Primarily the idea for this subreddit stemmed from wanting a place where stories by subject374 were organized in such a way that stories old and new would be easily found by readers old and new.* 


*The categorization system being used organizes every story written by our topic author into comprehensive lists based on what series they belong to (whether you know it or not), what genre they were written for, or what type of subject they include.* 


*These lists are not meant to be commented on, unless you believe a story is missing from the list.*


*Discussion posts are something that we hope gets the readers involved with this community, and with the much larger r/nosleep community.* 


*The same discussion will likely be featured multiple times, to make sure that new members of the community have their opinions heard. If your opinion, concern, or comment in general was not addressed in an old discussion post, feel free to restate it in a future discussion post.* 


*Do not abuse the opportunity to restate your opinion, comments that are repeated multiple times without positively adding to the discussion will be removed. It is never necessary to spam the sub with your opinion.* 


*Discussion posts are open for any visitor to comment on, but please remember to follow the guidelines given during each post for comments. Remember to keep all comments respectful and civil. Certain discussion posts will ask for criticism, complaints, or questions about stories. Feel free to speak your mind in a civil manner on these posts.*


Those are basically the primary rules of being here, so please keep them in mind and refer to the official rules list to see each rule described. Only two are currently listed in this post, but the descriptions here covered almost all of our currents rules.

There you have it, the gist of this sub. I apologize if you're viewing this sub in its fetal state, we hope to mature fast a become exactly what we were meant to be.

For now, this is where I let you go. You have received your introduction and your briefing on the organized chaos which roams here. Dare you enter further, or will you run screaming while you can and never look back?

<TEXT> My suggestions fall perfectly in line with the other commenter. Edit out redundant bits, format a few paragraphs a little better, fix some grammatical errors, and make your narrator easier to understand and connect with. We want to *feel* what she feels. 

I really like the concept of this story, it contained enough horror elements to be left where it is, which is exactly what each part of a series should be. 

At the same time, the questions brought up and the final line leave the reader curious for more, which is a great feeling to give people when you're creating a series. 

Remember, at the very least you should outline where you want to take the story with future posts, and make sure that each part of the story has enough meaningful content and builds upon the story well enough to warrant an entire part. No one enjoys reading a series of lackluster short posts which drag a series out too long. Get your ideas and your entire plot played out in as few posts as you can. The easiest way to do so is to know exactly where your story will go before you post the first part. You don't *have* to have it all written, but you'll find that planning it out well enough to post the entire series within whatever time frame you give yourself, will take a lot of the stress that creating a series may bring.

Long posts in series that do well to build upon the story and the characters within are generally the best thing that I've noticed. We enjoy meat to our stories, we want the blood that flows through the veins of a story to spill brightly, and filler is never fun. Don't waste your writing ability on something meant to merely tide over the readers until a better post in the series comes along. 

Make every post count. Make sure you get out all the things you want to be a part of it. 

You've got a great start, keep at it. I'd love to check it out once it's posted. And good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the story is really well done, and you shouldn't worry about the upvotes. Don't let invisible internet points be your only motivation towards writing. 

Write what you know, write what you enjoy, and let the rest be damned. The most important part of writing in enjoying the process, regardless of the outcome.

Not every story is going to catch the attention of the masses, but not catching attention doesn't make a story a bad one. Keep working on stories, keep putting out content that *you* enjoy writing, and eventually your hard work will be noticed. 

Amazing stories that have been overlooked in the past will be read by future readers interested in seeing more of work. The votes don't account for the actual readership of your stories. 

Who knows how many people loved it but didn't vote, or don't have accounts to be able to vote? 

Keep it up, you can do this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Where do you see yourself in five years?* 

Happy maybe, or dead. 


It's a question I've been asked a lot, and I have never been quite sure how to answer it. There are things I *want* to do, there is so much of life I haven't experienced. Yet I couldn't pinpoint what to do. Often enough I feel entirely at a loss for what to do with myself, I mean, what's the point?


Here I am at 19, working in perhaps the strangest and most secretive hotel ever to exist, because I really needed for there to be a point. I needed a way out of the life I'd found myself stuck in.


Four years ago was when an abusive man made me realize my only option. I had to run. I had a friend who I'd known since elementary school who was several years older than me, lived in the U.S, and was already engaged with a baby on the way. They were just scraping by themselves since they were both barely 20, but they knew the extent of what I was living with and offered me a hideaway. 


It was the end of my freshman year of highschool, and I told my father about plans to *visit* some friends over the summer. He seemed to be fine with having me gone, but the weeks leading up to my departure were some of the worst. I used all the money I had left from babysitting to buy a bus ticket-- which was a small sum, since that's what happens when your father borrows your money for beer-- and packed my bags days before I was set to leave. 


The morning of my trip my father woke me up at 6am. I had to be out of the house and in the car within five minutes if I wanted to leave, he was not in a good mood. We drove at 90(Km) on a street that I believe was 30. I think we hit 140 on the highway. By 6:30 we were at the truck stop where the bus would be picking me up. Usually a 45 minute drive at the least. When I got out of the car, he peeled out of the parking lot, causing bystanders to stare. 


It was nearly four hours til my bus would arrive, I had no spare money to buy food from the truck stop, nor any food with me, and I sat at a picnic bench outside and waited with my single suitcase for hours. Thankfully my phone was working, and I spent the time texting my friends to tell them I'd see them in a few weeks. Those texts changed into goodbyes later when I was across the border and safe. I got on the bus and travelled to the biggest city in the country, where I met with my friend, Emily. 


She was a dual citizen, and planned to drive me from this city to her house. We got in the car and drove, stopping at the border to identify ourselves. Being under 16 I didn't need a passport to cross, but a birth certificate. They also asked if I had permission from my parents, since my friend was obviously not old enough to be my guardian. I actually had managed to get my father to drunkenly sign a note I'd typed up to give myself permission to go for a few weeks; He assumed it was a school form and didn't read it. We got across and back to Emilys house in a few hours of relative peace. I was finally in a place where my father couldn't follow due to his criminal past.


Money was often tight, I couldn't work because I had no social security, and no one would pay me under the table within a reasonable distance. I had no car or license, and couldn't get one. Emily attended a local community college and her fiance worked, but it was just barely enough to cover the bills and cost of her classes. The process of becoming a citizen took awhile for her, she was lucky that she came here when she was older and had a better paying job before coming. Emily had a nice chunk in her savings by the time she crossed over, and it still took her over a year to become a citizen. 


I've been here for nearly five years now, I'll be twenty pretty soon. We've hardly got anything saved towards paying for my citizenship, and I constantly feel guilty that I can't help get things moving. Since I've been here they had their first baby, and now Emily is pregnant with their third. Since both of them are still trying to lead normal lives, I've been helping to take care of their kids and the house. 


Emily has managed to continue to go to school, though taking certain semesters off to care for her kids has definitely slowed down the already long process of nursing school. Her fiance, Jeremy, has been working a steady job all this time. It pays well, but with a growing family things can be pretty rough at times. 


I finished out high school here, because schools can't decline you based on citizenship apparently. I have a high school diploma, from an American school. That helped me not feel so useless for my first couple of years here, but since money is too tight for me to attend college as well I've been doing a lot of nothing for nearly two years. I just help around the house, spend time with Emily and Jeremy, and help with the kids. I've always wished I could do more. 


That's why yesterday when I got a text from a number in the same area code as me, that said there was a way that I could earn money without needing a social security number, I was more excited than wary. I assumed it was a friend who I had given my number to on Facebook while discussing my job search, and didn't bother asking who I was talking to. I figured I could do just about any job that would help towards becoming a citizen, finally attending college, and becoming someone real within the world. They ended up sending me an email to contact. I didn't hesitate to send in an email containing my nearly empty resume.


I received a reply within minutes, asking me to detail my current financial situation and my reasoning for wanting the job. 


I explained how I had been told that I could be hired here without a Social Security number, and how I couldn't find anywhere else that would do so. I also told him why I needed the money, and vaguely described my living situation.


He seemed very kind in his reply, letting me know that he could have someone pick me up to bring me in for a final interview, after I filled out their application form. I quickly filled out the form that was sent to me, slightly confused by some of the questions it contained. He gave another hasty reply, seeming pleased with my application he offered to have an employee come pick me up at three that afternoon to have our final interview by 5pm. 


He gave me some details of the job they wanted me for, and I was pleased that it seemed to be simple work. $40 an hour to do housekeeping for a hotel. $10 from my pay would be taken each week for the cost of having someone from the hotel driving me to and from work. All further details would be discussed during the interview.


Emily arrived home at two, and I excitedly told her about the job offering. One of the emails told me that I should not reveal the name of the hotel that was hiring me to anyone, because they didn't want it being known that they would pay under the table. I told Emily this, and she didn't pester to know the exact details of my employment. 


At 3:10pm a truck pulled up in front of the house, a good choice to fit into the middle-of-nowhere area we lived. I told Emily I'd see her later in the evening, and set outside to introduce myself to the stranger in the car. I've never been the outgoing type, but I've been told that I'm always a really friendly person. I don't have many friends, but I've met many people and all of those first impressions seem to have gone well.


The driver introduced himself as Tyler, an employee at the hotel, and he apologized for being late. He explained that he didn't drive a lot for the hotel, and he'd never picked up a passenger like me. He didn't ask me many questions, and didn't seem to be aware of the reason he was picking me up. 


Will you be driving me everyday? I asked him to break to silence of the drive.


Everyday? He questioned back. 


For work? I'm going in for an interview, I told him.


Ohhh, the word was dragged out, as though it was dispelling whatever other reason he had thought he was escorting me to the hotel, If we're on the same shift probably, your house is on the way from mine. 


I debated asking him what the he initially thought he was escorting me for, but instead I let the car fall into another moment of silence. I've never been the best at keeping a conversation going, but his voice soon filled the vehicle again.


If you get the job, I can tell you it's an experience like no other. I can't tell you much, since you're not an employee yet, but Mister Smith will go over all the details with you, I'm sure, he paused to smile at me for a moment, Any idea what position you'll be working?


Housekeeping, I replied distractedly, wondering about what sort of hotel this could be to provide experiences worth talking about, while being unable to talk about them.


Ugh, he made a face of exaggerated displeasure, Better you than me, I couldn't clean up after strangers. I'd find it tedious.


I shrugged, It's pretty much all I'm good at.


His face was in an expression of apology when he glanced at me, I didn't mean anything bad by that, it's valid work.


I smiled at him, not wanting him to worry over a comment that I honestly hadn't taken any offence with, I know, I was just saying. That's why it's a great job for me.


He seemed relieved that he hadn't come off as rude, and we spent the rest of the ride cycling in between small talk and silence. It was pleasant, I felt comfortable and relatively confident about the job. Meaning that I didn't really feel confident whatsoever, but I'd choke those feelings down and attempt not to let my nervousness shine through during the interview.


Tyler pulled up in front of the hotel, and I was astounded that such grandeur could exist in the heavily wooded area. The forest that surrounded must have been ancient, because the trees that filled it were taller than I could have ever imagined any trees to be. Somehow the hotel looked natural among the towering foliage, as though it was meant to be in this place. It was beautiful and remote, a perfect getaway. I felt at peace as I got out of the car, *almost* enough to ease my nerves over the rapidly incoming interview. 


Tyler directed me to head into the lobby and speak to someone at the front desk while he parked the truck with the other hotel vehicles. I entered the hotel to find a lobby as immaculate as the exterior, the hotel was truly extravagant, and I could almost understand why the application featured such odd personal questions. It brought the large paycheck into perspective as well, and defeated any wariness that may have been held deep within me. 


There was a girl with long, raven-colored hair, and shocking blue eyes who stood behind the front desk. 


Welcome to the Good Shade, I'm Dawn, how can I help you? She greeted cheerfully as I arrived at the desk. 


I squinted for a moment at her name tag, which quite obviously did not say Dawn. That was the only opportunity I've had so far to look at her name tag, but if I recall correctly it said *Alphaea I.C*. I'm not sure what that means, but it didn't really look like a name to me, so I dismissed it as some sort of labelling the hotel has for staff. 


I returned her smile, I'm here to see Mister Smith about a position here. 


Oh! She gasped excitedly, I knew you'd be here soon, right this way, he's waiting for you. 


With a glee filled smile she gestured to a door behind the front desk. I wasn't sure what she was so excited about, but as I walked towards the door I could swear that she *sniffed* me. I found myself slightly concerned about the mental health of the girl at the front desk, and wondered vaguely if people like her were the reason that the application contained such odd questions.


A tall man sat behind a dark wood desk, and introduced himself as Mister Smith. He was the owner and manager of the hotel. He created all the rules and guidelines for the staff and guests, and he oversaw all that went on inside the hotel. He also personally dealt with all applications for employment, which apparently didn't happen often. Before any conversation about the position took place, I had to sign an agreement to keep everything confidential. Honestly, I wouldn't even know that posting here was an option if I hadn't seen [Tyler's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6104g9/the_good_shade_hotel/) on here a while back. 


I've been reading the awful tales of the darkest moments in the lives of people for many years, but I never thought I'd be one of the people posting. That's besides the point though, I have to finish detailing what I experienced last night. 


After signing the form we began discussing the job. I'd be doing regular hotel housekeeping-- for the most part. My job would not always be a regular one, there was the possibility of my assistance being needed with guests, or I may end up requested by a guest for certain actions. I was fine with all of that. Some of the actions detailed deep within the contract seemed odd, but it was all well within what was worth it for the job and the money. This was the only job I could get, and it honestly didn't seem like a bad one.


We arranged to have 30% of my pay deposited directly into Jeremy's account, after a quick phone call with him to confirm this was acceptable. That portion would be what I used to pay back Emily and Jeremy for housing me for free over the years. 60% would be deposited into a savings account that the hotel had provided me with. Another contract had to be signed there, but all Mister Smith did was make a phone call in private afterwards. The final ten percent would be put into a chequing account that came with the savings. That was the money I planned to spend freely, whether I used it to buy clothes, groceries, or help out with the bills when things were tight at home. 


My savings would first be going towards citizenship, then getting a cheap place for myself. I plan to stop being a burden on my friends as soon as I can, they have a growing family and shouldn't also have to deal with a nearly 20 year old woman living off of them. Once the apartment was in place and I had enough in my savings, I'd be able to work towards college. Living on my own would have me spending a portion of my cheque on rent, but if I manage to keep this job that won't be an issue. This job paid more than well enough for me to finally get myself out into the world.


I suppose that I should have been concerned when he asked me to confirm my genetic background. When I replied that I was fairly certain that I was 100% human, he seemed skeptical. He squinted at me for a moment, and it made me nervous. *Why on Earth would you question whether I'm human or not?* Then things got really strange, he asked me if I would mind consenting to a blood test. I agreed, but it definitely freaked me out. I kept reminding myself that this was my only option. 


By the end of the meeting I had agreed to the requirements of the job, had my blood taken, and signed what may have been dozens of forms. I also found out that my first shift had already begun, and I would be spending my night at the hotel. I called Emily from the phone in the office to let her know that I wouldn't be returning until morning. I was about to leave the office when the girl from the front desk entered the room. She held out a plastic card to me, and I was shocked when I realized what it was.


A debit card from a bank local to my area, it had my name on it and looked exactly like Emily's card from the same bank. Mister Smith assured me that this was a fully functional card, and that he had pulled some strings with a friend at the bank to create an account for me. As long as I was employed with the hotel they would be sure that I would face no consequences from possessing an American account before becoming a citizen, and Mister Smith would be glad to have his friend add my social security information once I become a citizen, so creating a new account and transferring the money would not be necessary in the future.


I was beyond grateful as I left the office, for the job, the bank account, and the understanding that my boss seemed to express over my confusing situation. I was told to speak to Dawn so that she could give me the items I'd need to begin my shift. When I was once again facing the front desk, both Dawn and Tyler stood behind it smiling.


Did you get the job? Tyler asked me.


I smiled, I did actually, Mister Smith told me I needed to speak to Dawn before I get to work. 


That's great-- He stopped short to stare intently at the computer screen in front of him for a brief moment, --Sorry, I've been requested to a room. Are you coming, Dawn? 


She shook her head, I have to help our new friend meet with Rose, but-- she squinted at the screen for a moment, -- It's just my stupid brother, you'll be fine, she rolled her eyes as she stepped away from the counter.


Tyler shrugged and walked off towards several sets of elevators, and I watched as he produced a key card and swiped it through a card reader before pressing the call button. As he got into the elevator I looked back to Dawn, who was pulling a piece of paper from a filing cabinet, then she walked back towards me. 


Read this, let me know if you have any questions, she stated simply.


I took the paper and looked it over, some of it brought my concern back into full force. 


*Welcome to housekeeping at the Good Shade,* 


*Your position is a key role in our hotel, as we are well known for how immaculately kept such a large establishment remains constantly. On request you may be provided with a brief map of the property, which explains some of the regulations about guests located in different areas of the hotel.*


*Certain rooms require specific towels, sheets, blankets, soaps, etcetera. Please refer to the head of our housekeeping crew for a list of rooms and their requirements.*


*At this point, you have already signed various contracts restricting you from speaking about any aspect of your job. This was included in the documents you signed, but we must reiterate that in the case of finding items that you consider to be suspicious, dangerous, illegal, evidence in a crime, or remnants of a crime, you are not to react as you would in a normal situation.*


*Emergency services are unable to be contacted from or enter our establishment. We have medical staff who can deal with any wounded person(s) found in a room. We also have teams to deal with any person(s) found who may be deceased. Please refrain from touching any person(s), whether they be living or deceased. This also includes any other guests, and generally the other employees.* 


*If accidental contact is made at any point, please refer to the front desk for treatment of any negative side effects. Other than the items above, housekeeping here is relatively the same as everywhere else. Please remember that we take pride in immaculately clean rooms. Please refer to the head of housekeeping for concerns about anything found while working, and further details about the job.* 


*- A. Smith, Owner   Manager* 


I think it's hardly a question that anyone who read such a thing would be fairly concerned about what kind of hotel this truly was. 

I need the money though, and on the bright side, at least if I find a dead body I don't have to be the one to remove it. After reviewing that sentence, I realize that my life may have hit it's utter low. 

Once I get enough money though, I could put this all behind me. I have a chance to quit in three months according to the contract, and there were consequences that I didn't want to learn about for quitting before you had worked the allotted time. 


This place seems to be incredibly serious about the whole secrecy thing, and I think this subreddit might be part of the reason that the employees can handle holding it in around the rest of the world.


I didn't bother asking Dawn any questions at that moment, I just steeled myself for the night ahead of me. She pulled out a key card and handed it to me with a smile.


Head to floor U1, and Rose should be in the laundry room waiting for you. That's the storage floor. 


U1? The strange label of the floor gave me pause.


She smiled as though this was a charmingly innocent question that was often brought up, Mister Smith always forgets to tell the new employees, we actually have 50 underground floors. When we send you to a room with the label U in front of the number, it's underground.


I nodded, I honestly had guessed as much when I'd first heard her announce the floor I needed to go to, but it was still a little surprising to know for a fact that this hotel has underground floors. What could have possibly motivated someone to build a hotel that had its majority of rooms below the earth? 


I thanked Dawn for her assistance, and headed towards the elevators. There was a handwritten message on the back of the housekeeping paper that I hadn't noticed until then, it said *Use the second elevator * 


I glanced back towards Dawn and she gave me a small smile and wave, before turning to type something into the computer. I arrived in front of the second elevator, and I swiped the card I held through the reader as I had seen Tyler do. The call button lit up when I pressed it, and the elevator opened before me in less than a minute. I got to the correctly labelled floor and was in the laundry room too fast to calm my nerves about my first shift.


There was a woman in there, maybe in her mid twenties. She was beautiful, tall and curvy, with honey-blonde hair spilling down to her waist. She turned to me as I approached, and she gave me a smile that warmed her ice-blue eyes. She straightened as she took in my appearance, and her sudden change in expression made it seem as though she sensed something was amiss. That expression quickly changed back though, and she introduced herself as Rose, the head of housekeeping. 


For my first night all she wanted me to do was two of the underground floors. Approximately ten rooms on each of those floors had been vacated earlier in the day and needed to be arranged for new guests. Around twenty rooms in one shift didn't sound bad. She told me which rooms needed certain things, and gave me a list that carefully inventoried every item that needed to be present in each room that I cleaned. She also explained to me the hotel protocol for cleaning various things, including blood. 


After all of the preparation I was finally ready to get to work. It was more than twenty rooms, but I didn't complain. I took a cleaning cart and headed off to the floor below me to begin. That floor consisted of mostly regular housekeeping tasks. I took my time, not wanting to be left with nothing to do halfway through my shift. After nearly three hours I finished 12 rooms on that floor. They were all pretty basic, each room was the same. 


I moved on to the next floor with around six hours left in the ten hour shift. The first few rooms went simply, I made beds and restocked towels. I vacuumed, swept, mopped, and wiped things down. As I progressed down the hallway I heard strange noises coming from occupied rooms. It ranged from crying, to screaming, to what seemed like some intense sexual activity. From one room I heard what sounded like chanting in a foreign language. All the strange noises put me slightly on edge, and I tried to push through the 15 rooms on the floor that I was assigned to clean.


I got to the last room and found blood splatter in the shower, fresh enough to still be pooling in the tub. 


The sight made me dizzy, and I had to take a moment to catch my breath. It freaked me out, I wasn't sure how fast blood dried but I felt like I had narrowly missed seeing criminal activity. I cleaned out the tub using the methods Rose had described to me, and finished that room faster than any other. Or at least, I thought I did. 


I walked out into the hallway and noticed a dried smear on the wall that hadn't been there before, assuming it was blood I quickly cleaned it. I wasn't about to get in trouble because a murderous guest was running rampant through the hotel. I was afraid though, what if the person who caused this bloodshed was still nearby? 


I strode hastily towards the elevator with my cart in tow. I let out a breath that I didn't realize I was holding when I met Rose back in the laundry room.


What took you so long? She asked as I put away the cart.


I was confused by the question, I still had hours left in my shift. I looked at the clock on the wall and was surprised to see that my shift had ended thirty minutes prior. Somehow I had lost a lot of time. I explained to her what I found while cleaning, but she seemed unconcerned. She dismissed me for the day, and I went up to the lobby to find Tyler. 


He informed me that his shift didn't end for over an hour, but I could nap in the office on the couch while Mister Smith was gone. I took the offer, and awoke later to have Tyler escort me to the truck we had arrived in. As we got in the vehicle I noticed his nametag, *Tyler Stephens, H.S.* 


What does H.S mean? Is that some sort of hotel label? I pointed towards the tag. 


He glanced at it and smiled, Kind of a hotel thing, they put your species on your nametag to help the guests. 


I was surprised. H.S is quite obviously homosapien, but what did Dawn's nametag mean? Was I truly working with people who weren't human? I didn't know how to respond with anything more intelligent than, *Oh, okay.* 


Tyler had just started the engine when I saw Dawn come running from the hotel. She stopped at my window and gestured for me to open it, and once it was down she handed me a small piece of metal. 


She told me it was my nametag, and I thanked her for delivering it. We drove away, and I found myself staring at the nametag. I wondered if I would fit in as an employee at this hotel. 


Perhaps most importantly, I'm wondering if the people here can answer a question while I'm employed. A question that Tyler had no clue how to answer on the drive. A question about what their blood test revealed, because I'm not sure why my nametag reads *Isabelle Lawrence, N.F.*


The last thing Tyler said to me before he dropped me off was this, You're going to see a lot of things that you've never expected, imagined, or wanted to see. If you think you've had a weird night already, you haven't seen anything yet. 


I had trouble going to sleep as the sun rose, I took the time to think about my life. 


*Where do you see yourself in five years?*


How can I know, when I'm not even sure if I'm human anymore?

<TITLE> Our Home Inspector Overlooked The Walls </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-21 17:11:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Not too long ago I became engaged to a wonderful girl named Ragini. She was smart, beautiful, and funny-- the perfect woman to spend my life with. We were so happy together, and not long after the engagement we began planning the date and looking for a home. The house came before the wedding date by a mere month. 


The house was a decent size for a family, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, fenced in yard. It was within our budget, but it was also a little run-down. We would be spending the first few months of our marriage repairing small issues and making the house our own. The first order of business was to call the man who inspected my parents home. 


It had been quite a while since they bought their current home, but Mike was still doing the same job. He was friendly, trusted by the family, and he was good at his job. He actually saved us some money by the time we made the deal and paid for the house, a few thousand dollars had been knocked off due to the repairs needed. Mike told is that there were no huge issues, everything could be done without outside help. I was happy to do the repairs on my own.


Buying a house was expensive, the wedding would be expensive, if doing the work myself meant saving a little money then I was more than up for it. Things went well for the first week, there was only one odd issue. Several times throughout each night it sounded like there was something scratching at the walls, clicking in the vents, or running through the house. I shrugged it off as mice, but Ragini wasn't so inclined to ignore the situation. 


She insisted we get rid of them, and was upset that Mike hadn't told us about a rodent issue. She ended up getting me to call Mike about it the next morning, and he informed me that he hadn't thought to check the walls himself. I heard him shuffling through papers over the phone.


Ah, yes, he spoke in a gruff voice, Robert was sposed to inspect the walls. You've got yourself an old house, lots of space between the walls. File says he was in, but it seems I'm missing his final report. 


What should we do? I asked, his information wasn't very helpful. 


Well this is probably just a filing error, if anything was seriously wrong he would have come to me about it. Hasnt been in for a few days, but I'll ask about it on his next shift. I'd say that you ought to get an exterminator before it gets worse. I'm sorry we didn't catch that for you. Do you need us to come back out? 


He sounded very understanding, and I ended up declining his offer to come back. It was a simple rodent issue, we could fix it on our own. The results of the call didn't please Ragini, but she was satisfied enough to let it go and call an exterminator. 


Ragini was a little too worried about whatever the exterminators were going to use to some our pest problem, so we ended up spending the rest of that day and night at my parents house. She didn't want to smell the poison, or the dead pests. We arrived home the next day to find a note taped to the front door. It was just the number for the exterminators. 


I called, and they explained that they were coming back today to remove the bodies. There had been an issue with another house, and since my home was a short notice job it wasn't their first priority. I was a little grossed out knowing that there were dead rodents in my walls, but at least they would be gone soon. 


My fiance wasn't impressed, and we ended up going out for lunch when the removal team arrived. We returned to the house a few hours later, we assumed it would be empty and rodent free. 


Arriving home did not yield the expected results. The truck which the removal team had driven was still parked in the driveway. Also parked in front of our home were two police cars and an ambulance. I had no idea what was going on, and Ragini stared at me with her own look of confusion. 


An officer came up to us, asking if we were the homeowners. I was too distracted to respond though, because at the same moment two other officers were exiting the front door of our house. They had a man in handcuffs between them. He was haggard and filthy, rust colored stains ran down the length of his clothes, and he was barefoot. He whimpered as they guided him towards their car. 


No, *no.* Please? Oh *please,* I'm sorry. I was *so hungry*. I'm *starving.* Let me eat, God *please* let me eat. 


His gaze darted across all of the people outside, and suddenly landed on Ragini and I. He lunged when he saw us, trying to remove himself from the clutch of the officers. They weren't prepared for the abrupt resistance, and he was stopped by a taser when he ran towards us at an inhuman speed. He collapsed to the ground mere feet from where we stood. 


He whimpered for another moment before he started to laugh. The officers began to lift him from the ground, and he giggled as he rose. Before they turned him away he let out a howling bout of hysterical laughter and stared directly at my fiancee and I. 


You two smell *delicious!* He spit as he fell into another round of the off-putting noise.


The officers roughly pulled him away. I stood there in shock, I had no idea who that psycho was. Ragini looked near tears as she stared up at me. 


He spit on me, she said quietly, not wanting to exaggerate the inconvenience. 


It couldn't have been exaggerated though, because her white blouse was covered in red specks. It wasn't saliva that had come spraying from his mouth as he laughed, it was blood. I planned on not telling her right away, but she lifted a finger to my face and wiped a drop off of my cheek. She stared for a moment before giving me a panicked glance, and I answered her silent question with a nod.


From that point on, the authorities gave us nothing but horrifying discoveries. The easiest way to tell you about it would be to skip ahead to where we are now. 


My family has decided to attempt to sue the real estate agency which sold us the home. They should have known what was going on. How could they not inspect their properties more thoroughly? I'm not sure how that lawsuit will go, but I don't think money is going to fix the traumatic after effects of living there. We're not sure if we want to live in the house, we've been staying with my parents until we decide. It should be safe know, but knowing the truth is off-putting. Our wedding went as planned.


After the investigation and our house being closed off as a crime scene for a while, the authorities told us the truth. The man that they arrested had been living in the crawlspace between our walls for years. He had been there since shortly before the previous homeowners left. They thought he was mentally ill, apparently he claimed was entirely cannibalistic and had not yet eaten a thing since his arrest. That was a week after he was put in.there.


The real reason that Robert never got his report to Mike was because he never left the house. Richard's remains were found in the walls, half of his body was eaten down to the bone. Richard wasn't the only body in the walls though. There were tons of bones found all over the crawlspace, it was practically a graveyard. 


That wasn't even the worst part. Apparently this man wasn't a strict cannibal, the remains of dogs and cats were found as well. They believe that they were all animals that had gone missing around the neighborhood. The last thing that they found might be the most terrifying, at least for Ragini and I. It's what keeps us from going home, it's what makes us wonder if there is anywhere truly private and safe. 


There were pictures. Hundreds, if not thousands. They were all of different people, but almost every recent one was of my wife and I. Apparently nearly every photo has been matched to a missing person, and this man is assumed to have murdered over 50 people in the last few years. The truly scary part? 


There was a week's worth of pictures for each person, a date on the back of each. The last picture in each set had two dates, the day it was taken and the day after. Beside the second date was a comment, usually something along the lines of *delicious*, *bitter*, *salty*. All descriptions of taste. 


The last picture of Ragini and I was taken the day of the extermination.

Merely introducing a low level of estrogen into a male body *does not* "turn" them transgender. That's ridiculous. I'm not entirely sure you're aware of what you're talking about. You sound like the classic priveledged white male, *it has estrogen so I can't touch it because my balls will die!*

Fucking ridiculous. Get a life. So what if it's makerketed directly at females, then don't use it, duh. There was literally no reason for you to claim using it would *turn you transgender*. Stupidest thing I've ever heard.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part of the agreement to receive compensation was for neither of us to mention the specific product, or the company who provided the items to test. 

I'm sorry I can't be of more help, my current warning is the best I could do.

I might convince Chrissi to show me her review submission and testing log, I think it would be okay to share that, and I know that there were details she didn't tell me that should be in her copies. 

That might prove to be more useful to those who are interested in buying the product. She's usually very in-depth in all of her work, and she understand skin care, health, and the entire process of product testing better than I do. I'll see what other information I can provide for you all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> All recent products that don't have reliable reveiws.

Hundreds if not thousands of people test products before they are released, honestly it shouldn't be that hard to do a little research on your skin care items.

Risk a painful and gruesome process, or Google "suchandsuch lotion review" and spend ten minutes checking it out.

If there's hardly any reveiws, or they aren't positive, find a different lotion. 

I'm not saying boycott the entire brand, I've said in other comments that I wouldn't be surprised if this was an elaborate imitation product by another company who is using the Dove brand to get their dangerous product into the world. 

"No proof or evidence", damn son, is this not the internet? A well of endless knowledge? 

Also, I'd recommend any brand or older Dove product that doesn't make your skin fall off c: Go wild with the possibilities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's only been a few weeks since Chrissi teted the product, and up until about three days ago similar reveiws were constantly going up and down on the site. 

I don't think they're going to all this work to hide it for no reason, and there's no way that they fixed the product entirely since it was last tested less than a week from today. 

Honestly, Dove was the only "big" brand that she tested, I wouldn't be surprised if this product was a knockoff that some other company is creating to make money off of the Dove name, yet didn't make a safe product.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chrissi was the most ambitious person I'd ever met. When she had a plan, she followed through. Throughout our high school years I witnessed her impressive talent as I stood by in the role of best friend. 


She had her high school career laid out as soon as we started. I spent the summer before our freshmen year helping her estimate scenarios that might be impactful enough to affect the plan. She needed back up plans in case something went awry in the next four years. It sounds crazy, but it's not really as OCD as it seems. She just made a mental checklist about how to deal with things when they came along so that the high school experience would have less surprises and be more productive. 


High school worked out great for her. She managed to get a job during freshmen year, and kept it until after she had graduated as the Valedictorian of our class. I'd spent the last four years in awe of her ability to succeed at so many things, and graduation day was when I realized that I was in love with her. Besides her success she was beautiful, thoughtful, kind, and compassionate. She was always the first one to offer her help, and she always worked on everything with a smile. 


11 months, two acceptance letters from the same school, and an awkward declaration of love later, we were living in a small apartment together as a happy couple. I've never been happier, even though things can be rough at times. It was hard to find a decent paying job while attending college, and Chrissi had to quit hers because we'd moved too far away. 


It's been almost a year since we graduated,and we've only been in this apartment for a few months. I've finally got a job, but it just barely covers the rent and utilities. Chrissi had a great idea a few weeks ago though, since we need more spare cash until she gets a job as well. She decided to take an offer doing some product testing, mostly cosmetics.


It was simple enough, she'd get a package containing several products every week. She would have to keep a log of how the products worked for her and if she had any obvious reactions. After the specified time for each product, she would have to write a review and submit it to the company who ran the whole thing. She'd get paid depending on how long she had to test each product. $20 per product, per day. 


She received three products the first week, all of which were five day trials. Her idea was definitely going to help around the house, and the paycheck came as a direct deposit into her account each Friday. We were happy, and we finally were doing everything right. Doing well at classes, both earning money, no longer having to scrape by to live. Things had become pretty much perfect, until the second week of product testing. 


She only got two products, some type of lip gloss and a bottle of Dove lotion. I remember the day she got them very well because she had been so excited. 


I heard her exclamation of *Ohmygod* as I entered the kitchen, she was emptying a package onto the counter. Between unnecessary amounts of bubble wrap was a small makeup bag, and inside were her new tester products. When she pulled out the lotion she actually squealed. 


Look! *Look!* They got a new one, I love these lotions, she waved the bottle in front of my face as she bounced around the room. 


I don't think I've ever seen someone so excited about lotion, but she explained that this bottle claimed to be the latest version of the lotion she already used. Apparently it was some special scent as well-- who knows. She's always been prone to dry skin, so I could almost understand why having decent lotion was a big deal. The real odd parts didn't start happening until a few days later. 


The lotion was a 14 day trial, the bottle claimed that it moisturized more than just the outer layer of skin. It was supposed to go deep into several layers to leave lasting moisture throughout each day. Chrissi was excited about it, and she started using it the morning after she got it. 


It didn't seem to do much at first-- in fact, her skin seemed to be even more dry after three days. She told me it was normal, sometimes they didn't work right away or well enough. Regardless, she would be adding this information into her testing log and her final review. She hadn't had any side effects other than the dryness, so she had to continue using the product to receive payment. 


By the end of the first week things got worse. The dry skin was so severe in some spots on her arms that it flaked off occasionally. I had one memorable evening where she reached across the table for salt and I saw a small chunk of skin fall from her arm and into the gravy bowl. I didn't finish dinner that night. This was also around the time that she started complaining of the itching.


She felt *something* under her skin, or at least that's what I think she told me. She didn't make a lot of sense when she tried to tell me, and I got the feeling that she was keeping things from me. I know she wouldn't want me to worry, but it was scary not knowing the specifics of what was going on. I also knew that she didn't want me to start thinking of the hospital, she adamantly avoids it due to our lack of insurance and the cost of healthcare. 


She told me that the company would give compensation for the reaction when the trial was over, and that she just needed to make sure she kept all the information in her log and review. It seemed simple enough, another few days of dry skin before we got paid. 


Things didn't stay so mild though. I'd hear Chrissi whimper throughout the day when her dry skin rubbed up against something. She complained of being itchy, but she couldn't scratch because it made the dry areas raw. By the time we hit the morning of the last day she was a mess.


She put the lotion on for the final time that morning, and that evening she'd write out the last day in her log, then type up the review. Her skin was dry, flaking off, raw in spots, and she was still so very itchy. I was glad it was over, I hated seeing her suffer just to get paid. I thought everything was in the clear, we were done with the testing. Chrissi would be sure to avoid this lotion when it came out in stores, she would stick to the regular kind. 


That afternoon things took a turn for the worst. Chrissi was in the shower, and I was feeling playful so I decided to join her. I couldn't hear her over the shower until I got in behind her, but she was crying. I grabbed her shoulders intending to turn her my way, and was met with the worst experience of my life. As I gripped her shoulders the skin beneath my hands started to slide away from her body. I moved my hands away quickly, but watched in sickened awe as the skin fell away from her body and landed on the shower floor with a wet splash. 


She turned to me, and I saw the same fate had met the skin of her chest and stomach. She sobbed as she met my eyes, trying to explain through her tears that she had only tried to shower. She cried that it itched, and cried that it stung. I didn't notice until that moment that the water level in the tub had risen above my ankles, and looking behind Chrissi revealed that large chunks of bloated skin had covered the drain. Her skin seemed to be taking on the water too well.


I delicately helped her out of the shower, it was a painfully slow process. She had lost skin from her neck down, it wasn't all gone but it was a substantial loss. I noticed that she hadn't really lost her skin either, only layers of it. Her body was covered with tender pink patches, but she could stand the pain enough to pat herself dry. Within moments the patches that had lost layers were wet again. She touched a finger to a spot, the clear liquid substance seemed sticky. She cried again. 


I was at a loss for what to do. Here stood my girlfriend and lifelong best friend, and she was missing over 60% of her skin. Even as I stood there I saw spots of pink flesh begin to weep blood, it diluted and spread as it met with the clear substance that coated her. 


W-we should go to the hospital, I stumbled over the words as I stared at her deformed figure. 


She looked down at herself, visibly wincing at the extensive damage, I'll be okay. 


She claimed that the hospital trip would be a waste, her skin would fix itself. It was only layers missing, it would be fine. I decided to listen to the stubborn girl who was going to school to be a nurse, or maybe I was just compliant while in shock. 


We ended up wrapping her in a thin cotton sheet, but she mostly walked around bare. It hurt when things touched her moist and exposed flesh. She typed her log, typed her review, and posted them. She told them everything. I wish I could have seen the angered words that must have been at the end of her review. 


Within twenty minutes of posting she received an email from the company running the testing. They weren't happy with her review.


After a series of heated emails back and forth, this is what Chrissi has told me: If she deletes the review and signs a non-disclosure agreement, then she will receive a hefty compensation-- were talking *buy-a-house-and-car* compensation.


It's been almost a month and Chrissi is pretty much all better. There's been a large deposit in her bank account, and Chrissis review of Doves newest lotion is no longer on the internet. 


There's a reason I had to warn people though. This entire time I've been checking into the website where Chrissi posts her reviews, and I've seen 15 other people experience the same side effects as Chrissi. All of those posts were removed shortly after they were posted, and who knows how many have been posted while I'm not online. That's not the worst part of it all, because now I know why they're paying so much and having this kept so quiet. 


Today at the store I saw a familiar bottle of Dove lotion on the shelves.

<TEXT> I woke up that morning and was prepared for a completely lackluster day. I had nothing planned except for a visit to the doctor today. I rolled myself out of bed, the sunlight stung my eyes and I felt nauseous. Groaning in annoyance I got up and stumbled my half asleep body into the bathroom to drink some water and shower. 


I felt better afterwards, I collected my phone from where it charged on my nightstand and headed downstairs to make myself some coffee. The nectar of champions, I swear I drink enough that my blood, sweat, and tears could be bottled into energy drinks. I scrolled through the notifications on my phone as I waited for my liquid motivation to brew. 


I received the regular slew of harassment that I had been dealing with for the last three months. Emails and texts littered my notifications. An organization that called themselves New Kind has been persistently contacting me. They want me to become a member, apparently I have assets which would be of great value to them. I can't deny that some of their offers seemed a bit appealing, but they reminded me of a church-- or *maybe* a cult. 


The benefits to their members sounded great though. Full payment for approved college courses, jobs within the organization, the option for reduced cost housing, and the opportunity to have connections to the political world. The New Kind was apparently some sort of obscure government party that had yet to have a candidate in the presidential election. 


Though the benefits were amazing, it wasn't for me. If the interest of the organization was politics, it was not something I could do. I find politics tedious, and would loathe each day that I worked in a position in that field. I'm not sure what a member may stand to gain from joining without working. What would you even be there for? What were you a part of?


For months I've had knocks on my door, people stopping me in the street, and messages delivered by mail, phone, and internet. The people in this organization have been relentless in their attempts at converting me, and I have *no idea why*. I've been followed, chased, and had my windows knocked upon in the middle of the night. I've called the police, got restraining orders against people that they specifically caught, but it didn't stop anything. 


The police couldn't find actual evidence of any organization of any sort that existed by this name. All of the people who had been caught harassing me had been found unrelated to each other-- most of them weren't even from this state. Honestly, I'm terrified every day because of them. They are obsessively trying to convince me, and they are well veiled from the law. There was nothing I could do to stop it, and the daily bombardment became a routine. 


It still freaked me out of course, but there was nothing I could do except live with it. Maybe it would eventually stop. Maybe one day I'll stop seeing people standing outside my windows. Maybe I'll stop hearing whispers when the house should be silent.


After ignoring and/or deleting the messages from New Kind, I noticed a different notification. I had a voicemail, no missed calls though. It made me wonder,*can you even leave a voicemail without calling the person first?* My phone had been turned on while charging with the volume up, there was no reason I could think of that explained the lack of a call. But then I realized there was-- my phone has been known to have fairly poor reception, so it was likely that the call hadn't come through while it was acting up.


The voicemail was from a private number, but I smirked to myself as I hit play. *Like I'm dumb enough to believe this isn't about New Kind.* I rarely got voicemails, and never ones from private numbers. I assumed it was a new tactic for New Kind to pester me. I poured my coffee into a travel mug as a moment of quiet static came from my phone. I was surprised to hear an unfamiliar female voice, she sounded young-- maybe around my age. The surprising part was that she sounded scared, it was a stark contrast to the usual cheer which members of New Kind seemed to have an endless supply of.


*Listen. Claire White? This is for you. I'm going to tell you a story, to explain why you should never have children. My name is Claire Robins.*


I was a little surprised, and paused the voicemail to check the caller ID again. Stupid, I know. Private number, zero hints about who left the message. I figured it must be one of my friends instead of the creepy organization, since I don't give out my number to strangers. I took an annoyed breath before continuing the message. My friends knew that I wasn't planning on having any kids, no doubt this was some sort of joke to mock my standing on birthing children. I don't have anyone to help me out, and my own mother wasn't the best role model. I didn't want to have kids that I'd have no idea how to raise.


I checked the recording length of the audio, it would take a while to listen to. I guess my friends created quite the story to tease me. I grabbed my purse, my coffee, a set of earbuds, my keys, and my phone. I hopped in the car and shoved the earbuds into my purse-- I didn't need them yet. 


I took a glance around my neighborhood, a familiar dark car was parked nearly two blocks away. It seemed that some person or another from New Kind was always keeping an eye on me. I felt a sudden chill and looked away, something deep inside me told me I had made accidental eye contact with one of my stalkers. I'm not sure why such a thing still scared me so much. I tried to shake off the feeling of dread that ran through my body.


I plugged my phone into the cable attached to the car radio, and when I turned on the car I hit play on the voicemail. As I drove I listened, and the following is what I heard. Items in *this format, including brackets* are my own notes, to maintain minimal confusion for anyone reading.


The voicemail: 


-----


The easiest way to tell you this would be in the form of a story, but this story is true. I don't mean to insult your intelligence, but you need to take this seriously. You may not believe it at first, but I hope once everything is revealed to you that you will make the right choice. I hope I'm not too late to tell you. I think we'll begin with the moment I finally started working hard on my plan. It started with yet another mandatory news broadcast, I remember it all.


*Scratchy noise, possibly the recording device being moved. The voice coming through the speakers begins mid sentence, and is that of an older, but cheerful female. The sound was loud and distorted, as though the recording device was placed very close to a speaker*: 


**... Again we will see the light of day. Once again we will overcome the trials of famine, pestilence, and the ever-present threat of anarchy. Once again WE WILL SAVE YOU. These hard times will not dilute our determination to outlast our ancestors, we WILL prove that we have developed greatly as a civilization. This is the future! You are the future! Your children may be the first generations to experience the success of the New Kind! We ALONE have the power to make this world better, and total peace is nearly within reach.**


*I shivered as I listened to the recording that was part of the voicemail. New Kind. Was this some sort of advanced method to recruit me? I continued listening, unsure of how this related to them.*


**We are commencing the testing for this year in three weeks time. If you have never had this process explained to you, please seek assistance and information from a New Kind representative in your area. Thank you for giving your attention to this mandatory message--**


*Static noise, recording device being moved, followed by the other Claire speaking again*:


The message from Prime Minister Amari wasn't a shock, the speech that preceded her testing announcement was something we were used to. Our PM likes to recycle the same sentiments each time she addresses her nation. 


I vaguely wondered if the world had always been so corrupt under the surface, and if the fourth World War had just finally cracked the seal which held that darkness at bay. I wondered if other remaining nations did the same as us; I wondered if they even knew what we had done.


This is it though, this is me hoping to stop the madness. This is me recording what may be my last days-- I forgot to mention that when I started recording. It's hasn't been long since I set my plan into action, but if all goes well I won't be around to know. If things go wrong, well, perhaps someone from one of the other nations will find this audio device eventually. With respect to that I will explain what has been going on in the United Haven-- and maybe what the United Haven is. 


Be you Claire White, a far off nation, or a future member of the Earth who stumbled across this recording, *please* pay *very* close attention to the information I'm about to give you.


As we know there have been four World Wars.


* I narrowed my eyes at the road ahead as I heard the false words. There's only been two world wars, what nonsense was this other Claire spouting?*


People thought the third war was tragic, yet that was practically nothing. Only one country from back then faced the fate that a nuclear weapon brings about. That area was nicknamed the Land of the Damned for a long time. It wasn't even close to being inhabitable by the time we hit the fourth World War.


Everyone thought that humans had learned their lesson about the sacrifice that war demands when they killed an entire country, but apparently they had not learned enough. The fourth war saw the Land of the Damned expand greatly, and I was never taught the names of the many countries which used to stand before the toxic wasteland invaded.


There weren't many years between the wars, I believe I'm no more than five or six generations from where the Claire White I'm hoping to address is located. 


* My eyes involuntarily narrowed again. Was she claiming to be from the future?* 


My mother chose my name, it means something great in our society today. A giver of salvation. That's what they consider the First Ladies-- anyone named after them is likely the favorite child in the family. 


That brings me to the aftermath of the war. As far as our history texts have told us, the events that took place after the bombs were the most tragic tales in existence. More tragic than the initial death toll from the 27 nuclear weapons that were launched during the war. So many lives were lost in pursuit of the end of the war. Millions, maybe billions. At least, that's what we are told in the United Haven. 


When the war came to an end, United Haven arose. The leaders of it were ready, an entire organization of people that spanned throughout the decades had been waiting for society to crumble so that they could rebuild it in their own vision. 


Their vision is now our reality. They haven't completed it yet, but the methods they are using to achieve their goals are actions beyond what any human with morals could commit. We have cut all ties with outside nations, we are advised to ignore the fact that we aren't the only people on the Earth. If we ignore the outside, they will ignore us. That's exactly as it works too, we have zero interaction of any kind with anyone from outside of our nation. It seems to keep things peaceful-- at least between nations.


That means that most of our information about the outside world is passed down through family, tales of the past that no one could imagine happening today. I'm not sure why we couldn't imagine it, it's not as though this world has become any less cruel. Other information about the outside is given to us from the New Kind, like the history books and archived news broadcasts. 


From what I've gathered I can almost positively say that the United Haven is what used to be called North America. Though most of these antique maps show islands that have long since gone underwater. Our nation itself is not as big as one from the past may expect, every year the water rises a miniscule amount. We've lost many miles of coast land over the years.


Nuclear fallout has left most of the southern part of our country a wasteland, there are still many people who end up with radiation poisoning from being too close to the bomb sites. I honestly think the radiation is spreading, as though there's too much of it in the air to ever leave. It'll spread across the planet and smother us all while we sit unaware. Then again, who knows how they may have enhanced these weapons before the attacks. Who knows what deadly thing may have been unleashed. 


It's been years since the war, but no one has stopped being afraid. The people who don't seem afraid belong to the government. A government run by the New Kind. The New Kind are mainly women, generations who have hidden behind the scenes to develop a plan to make this nation great. Hundreds who knew that the war was coming and used it for their own gain. 


Oh, I forgot the tragedies-- these leaders have given us tales and evidence of the most depraved acts that were committed during and after the war. Communities who brought all the children around to the lakes, forcing them to drown in the toxic water. They were already poisoned from the nearby bombs, no one wanted all those children to suffer.


The worst part of learning about this part of the war was the video recording that came with it. It revealed women screaming as other women and men dragged children underwater. They were being held away from the children, obviously they did not agree with the majority of the community. Not only that, but the New Kind members who showed us these videos seemed very pleased as they watched the events unfold.


Other videos contained similarly soul crushing acts. People lit their homes ablaze while their families were trapped inside, groups of school children were led by their teachers to leap from bridges and overpasses, some videos showed people running mad through the streets. There was so much death, so much murder and suicide.


During the war rape and slaughter awaited in the streets, people were living without fear of consequences. *Were all dying anyways, why not?* Suicides, homicides, and crime as a whole rose. People were convinced that the world was ending, or they knew the war would take them in due time. No one wanted to sit around and wait for death.


I'm rambling I know, so let me simplify this for you. United Haven is a large country that is being governed by women and has isolated itself from the world since the greatest nuclear war in history. Society as a whole has gotten back to a relatively normal state. We have water, power, technology, and homes. We look normal. 


We aren't. 


Our government isn't run by peaceful matriarchs who want us to feel safe and free. The goal of the government is to maintain their positions of power, and control who will receive that power in the future. Men are treated as slaves and experiments, I'm fairly sure the researchers are trying to manipulate future DNA so that we stop producing boys. 


Children are monitored heavily, and disciplinary acts for any age are cruel and severe. The government is always watching for people who develop the right characteristics to be part of the New Kind. In fact, that's their preferred name. The women in charge want us to know exactly who controls us. Disobedience is not an option, we live pretending everything is fine. Pretending that the next town over isn't blackened shell that's been abandoned from the war, pretending that we're not afraid of the water purification devices failing, pretending that everyone who joins the New Kind is okay. 


There is no water supply that isn't contaminated, so abandoning our corrupt society is not an option. Much of the wilderness is contaminated with patches" of toxicity. Anyone who abandons civilization faces sure death. Live with them, or die alone in great suffering. The New Kind monitor their technology intently, anyone trying to leave the nations or disobey them is promptly dealt with. There is nowhere that they can't hear what you're saying. 


Yes, I know they're listening to me right now. *I KNOW YOU'RE LISTENING!*


-----


I flinched when her sudden scream came through the speakers in my car. The sound seemed to vibrate me to the core, as though this other Claire was sitting directly beside me. I actually glanced around the car as her message reached a moment of silence. I nearly laughed at myself, the amazing quality of this audio made her sound so close. I froze mid smile as I saw a car pull into the parking lot before me-- the same car that had been parked down the street from my home.


I paused the voicemail as I parked my car in front of the doctors small office. I collected my phone and purse, and glanced around. No one had left the other car, they rarely came up to me directly in public places. I let out a sigh at myself, I wasn't as calm about being constantly followed as I imagined I was. I tried to ignore my silent stalkers and entered the building. 


After speaking to the receptionist and confirming that my bi-annual check up was scheduled for 10am, I checked the time. I had ten minutes until my appointment, not including whatever extra time the patient already inside may take up. I sat in one of the hard chairs in the waiting area. Once I fished the earphones from my purse and plugged them into my phone I unpaused the voicemail, tensing in case the screaming renewed. 


Instead she continued in almost a whisper.


-----


I'm sorry That was inappropriate. I just get so frustrated about the state of my home. This entire New Kind organization is not a saving grace, they are monsters. They torture anyone who is not a part of them, they're secretive-- no one knew they existed until they decided to volunteer themselves as acting government until things settled from the war. I guess things never settled, or the rest of the population are too blind to see what the New Kind really are.


The testing, I forgot to mention that. It's part of the reason I'm reaching out to you, through everything I have learned in my desperate search for answers, you are a key element. There are hundreds if not thousands of other women in your generation that will help to strengthen the New Kind. Yes, I said *strengthen*. They already exist in your time, they're already recruiting. They've been around for too long. 


* My heart began to race as her voice picked up volume. She seemed so open and honest, as though she wholeheartedly believed in what she was telling me. Wasn't this what I was hoping for? Answers about New Kind? These were not the answers I was expecting.* 


Anyways, the testing examines your DNA and pinpoints markers that are found in the most loyal and successful of the New Kind. At this point almost every one of them contains every marker. These days they've only been examining pregnant women-- everyone else has already been tested. They've developed the technology to determine everything they need to know about a fetus. At least that's what they've told us, it doesn't seem to add up entirely. What is the *true* thing that their members possess which makes them desirable?


If you're pregnant with a child who contains all the markers, the New Kind adopts them at the moment of birth. You have no say in this. If they contain more than 40% of the markers but not *all*, you can raise them but they must attend a New Kind school. They will either develop to become low level members of the New Kind, or not. When they graduate at 18 you lose your child. You don't get to know if they were accepted into the New Kind, or if they were executed for knowing too much but not being good enough. If your child has less than 40% of the markers, congratulations, you get to have as normal of a family as you can.


This is where my issue lies. I'm going to be tested, and I know I'm pregnant. The chances of the baby not ending up with the New Kind are slim. I had a small indiscretion with one of the relatively high ranking men-- even the highest ranked man is worth next to nothing compared to the female roles-- their DNA markers ensure that members of New Kind have an almost guaranteed chance of making a New Kind child. 


Mother's that fight for their children don't last long, and there is no way to hide the pregnancy and avoid the test. They are everywhere.


I can't escape the fact that in a few months I will lose my baby. That day I heard the first announcement for the testing I panicked, I had discovered my pregnancy a few weeks prior. Hardly two months along by the time I remembered I'd be tested. Abortion is not an option now, and there is nowhere to go that they wouldn't see. They will kill me and anyone involved, so many people have already died. I can't be responsible for more, if my baby is a girl she could end up as one of the people who caused the state of fear we live in. 


The world ended and they reaped the suffering, bringing along their own form of it. I can't imagine what it takes to become one of them, but I wish they had never existed. This is why I sought you out, this is why I chose you out of all who I found. I was named for you. 


-----


I paused the voicemail when someone tapped on my shoulder. I glanced up to see the face of my doctor, he smiled. His other patient had left, and since my appointment started in less than five minutes he took me in early. 


The appointment was short, he did all the basic checks that I'm used to, and then I had to give him a urine sample, and a full physical with whatever tests that requires. I'm planning on applying for a nursing program at my local college, and they require me to get my own drug/physical tests and submit the results before I can be accepted. Not an issue for me, recreational drugs weren't my forte, I don't smoke, I'm fairly healthy, and partake in safe sexual interactions. He told me he could have the results back to me within a few days, and I left his office.


I didn't feel like listening to the rest of the recording on the ride home, I was too confused. There was a different car now that had followed me out of the parking lot, and I was more paranoid about it than usual. What if these people really *are* as awful as the voicemail said? Why do they want me? I had long since dismissed my initial thoughts about the message being a friendly prank. It was way too weird, and none of my friends are heartless enough to use my frightening stalker situation as fuel for humor. Honestly, I was entirely stressed out.


I spent that night fighting the urge to scream, tapping came from my windows and my phone rang repeatedly with calls from various members of New Kind. I shut off my phone, crawled into my bed, and turned on the radio to block out the people at my windows. I fell asleep shivering and crying beneath the blankets as the tapping turned to knocking, then pounding. 


By the next morning I was exhausted and curiosity got the better of me. I really wanted to know why I got that message, what was the point of it all? I had spent all night dreaming about a world in waste, where murderous matriarchs slaughtered those who opposed them. I woke up terrified, a sinking feeling deep in my stomach sat so deeply that it made me physically sick. After emptying my already baren stomach I sat down to clear my head, I couldn't pinpoint the deep sense of foreboding that ran through my body as I debated listening to the end of the voicemail.


I thought for a moment about deleting it, leaving it as something that did nothing but waste my time and fill my head with dark thoughts about the future. Maybe this other Claire had a good ending for the future she claimed to be a part of. She couldn't just be some random crazy person who happened to know my name and number, and then decide to call and ramble on about a dystopic future and the exact organization that has been making my life miserable.


I pulled up the voicemail on my phone and hit play.


-----


You are the mother of a First Lady. There were several before you and many after, but you are one of the most important keys. The First Ladies are the most revolutionary of the New Kind leaders. They bring the brightest ideas, the most controversial plans, and the most strictly enforced rules. They made the skeleton and nervous system which the body of the New Kind functions upon. They basically rule over all. 



A First Lady is automatically put in the running for Prime Minister. In fact, *everyone* who runs must be near or equal to First Lady status. Also, the Prime Minister must be a woman. Through psychological manipulation of the leftover population, they managed to rule and have their laws set as the norm. It's an awful time to be alive. 


Claire White, your daughter is going to be one of the greatest First Ladies ever to join the New Kind. Your name is sacred among them, as she chose to claim it as hers when she joined. There are several sacred names, all passed on by a First Lady. You choose your name upon joining, or your guardians pick your name if you begin young. My mother expected me to be eligible for the New Kind, but the name Claire is misplaced on me. I'm not enough for them, I'm glad I'm not.


Please Claire, I beg of you, please don't have any children. Avoid it at any cost. Your child will bring forth some of the most depraved actions that the New Kind have committed in secret. She will be so highly honored. Please, don't let her live.


-----


That was the end of the voicemail. I sat there and thought for a moment, wondering if this really was a joke. There wasn't really anything funny about it. It does nothing but enhance my fear of New Kind. Was this their doing? 


How does that make any sense? I mean, if confusing me was the point then they succeeded. I didn't know what to do with that information, I didn't have any way to prove it true or false. I tried to put it out of my mind that day, thinking about messages sent from the future puts a heavy weight on your mind. I took a nap and tried to ignore my daily dose of New Kind bombardment.


My doctor called me later that evening sounding joyful. No drugs in my system, I was good to go on the nursing course. After he filled me in on all the good news he had obtained from my tests, I went to hang up. He stopped me with a few words.


Why didn't you tell me? My wife could help you, she works at the hospital nearby.


My stomach dropped, but I didn't yet realize why, Um, what do you mean?


Your pregnancy of course! Did you forget that my wife offered to help you with prenatal care? I mean it was over a year ago, and you did say that children weren't in the plan, but-- 


I'm pregnant? I cut him off, stunned and on the verge of throwing up again.


Well yes, you didn't know? You should see someone about the baby specifically now--


Okay, bye, I cut him off once again and promptly hung up the call. 


I panicked, probably even hyperventilated. *What are the chances?* Seriously, what are the chances that I discover I'm pregnant the same day that a supposed message from the future claims my spawn will practically be Satan? 


I've been to several visits with doctors since then. I had no idea, but I'm nearly four months along now. It's been a few weeks since I got that voicemail. My friends have listened to it as well, and none of them are taking the blame. They didn't do it. 


I'm at a total loss, how do I deal with a warning from the future? What is the truth behind New Kind? How much of the truth did Claire Robinson actually know?


I think maybe that call was fake, maybe from New Kind. Maybe they were messing with my head because of my persistent denial. I'm still unsure, and I'm still afraid. I have one belief though: There is no way that I'm going to give birth to a child that will grow into an evil tyrant. I'm not hurting the world, I'm not a monster, and I'm not giving my baby up. I never wanted kids, but something about the life growing inside me has changed that. 


I want to raise a child, I want to give my care and affection, I want to teach, love, and inspire. I want to motivate, to be a shoulder to cry on, and a well of wisdom. Something about this baby demands that I be a good mother, it demands that I help my child succeed in life-- whatever life they choose. I have to give my child freedom, or as much as I can while New Kind monitors me constantly. I have to protect my child from them.


I'm not sure what to do yet, I'm not sure how to keep her away from them. What about the other mothers of New Kind members? I'm not alone in this. How do you protect your child from something that the future dictates will happen? 


Today marks the day where I fully believe I received that message from the future. This is my warning to anyone-- but especially women. Please avoid an organization called New Kind, please keep yourself and families away. Do not join them, no matter the offer. Do not trust them. I'm nearly at my breaking point with being followed, but I can't do anything. 


I might just give up and join them, I fear that they are waiting only to take my baby. I found out this morning during an ultrasound that I'm having a girl. The news made my heart sink, but it made my belief in my namesake complete. That message was true.


I can't do anything except warn others away. I'm not letting them take my daughter away, I'm not letting them corrupt her. In fact, after I post thing I'm going to answer the tapping at my window. I'm going with her, I'll join them if it means I can protect her. 


Maybe everything will be okay.

<TEXT> It's been over three weeks since this began, and I think I'm starting to go insane. My girlfriend is acting insane, my friends are acting like *Im* insane, and my dog won't stop barking. Suffice to say I'm having a rough time lately, and I can't seem to figure out why. Before I get into the shadowy corners of my life though, let me start at the top.


I'd had a long day at work, and I arrived home late. It was around seven when I pulled my car into the driveway of the small bungalow which I call home. The house was a little pricey on rent, but it was worth it. This was one of the only areas that was a reasonable distance from both my job, and the college that my girlfriend attended. Kaylee lived a little further away from the school than me, so she spent nights with me if she had an early class the following day. I definitely didn't mind having her around, and she was friendly with my roommate. 


Sure, having a roommate isn't the best, but Jack is a really great guy. He cooks like a professional chef, and is insanely mature. He's become one a my best friends since we moved in together, and he always has his share of rent on time. Alabama was a fan of him as well-- Alabama would be my dog. A fluffy golden retriever, that dog means the world to me. 


My dog was part of the reason I was willing to pay more and share a house with a stranger. The house had a backyard, and there was actual *space* between the houses in the neighborhood. It was a refreshing change from the buildings within the city which pressed up against each other in a manner similar to having too many kids in one seat on the bus. Alabama appreciated the space out here, and the neighborhood was even nice enough to feel safe walking him at night. 


I had it all in this overpriced bungalow, and that night I had it all at once too. I was three steps north of exhausted when I walked up to the door, but that feeling was blown away as I registered the information in front of me. Alabama was jumping around my legs, apparently he had missed me today more than ever before. I noticed Kaylee's shoes by the door which made me happy, I'd been hoping to see her tonight. 


Alabama was pawing at the door while I took off my work shoes, he obviously wanted to be walked. I stepped into the living room to find my girlfriend, but I was momentarily distracted by a delicious scent that came from the kitchen.


Whatcha cooking, Jack? I called out as I walked towards him. 


You'll see when you eat it. Hold on, I'm busy. Kaylee's here. Tell her that it's almost done? He spoke quickly, he was very intent on whatever he was cooking. 


Not unusual for him, he makes the best food and that takes time. My own mother would envy the way that 23 year old could cook. Hell, I envied him myself. Two years younger than me and yet light-years older in the culinary department. I'll starve to death if I ever end up living alone. I headed over to the couch where Kaylee sat watching the TV with her full attention. I don't think she'd even noticed I was home yet, Pokemon was her absolute favorite show and she had no regard for the surrounding world when it was on.


I leaned over the back of the couch, gave her a peck on the cheek, and relayed the message from Jack. She nodded absently, giving me only minimal attention. I told her I was going to walk Alabama before dinner and she turned to me. 


You sure? It's getting dark, She sounded a little worried.


Babe, how many times do I have to tell you that this isn't your neighborhood? Seriously, it's totally safe here. I'll be back in twenty minutes tops, I gave her a wide smile, hoping it would ease her worries. 


She leaned up and kissed me on the cheek while telling me to stay aware of my surroundings, then she turned back to her show. She was adorable. Always worrying, anxious, but sweet. Sometimes she was absent minded, or she had trouble finding the motivation to finish things, but she was perfect to me. She may be insecure and not entirely up to dealing with the world each day, but she likes dealing with me so I count that as a win. 


I smiled to myself as I tied my running shoes, I had a relatively perfect life right now. My dark eyed beauty was sitting on the couch, holding a strand of shoulder-length black hair back so that it wouldn't interrupt her view of the show. She was so cute when she was lost in something she loved. My good friend and roommate was whipping up a meal that was sure to be both filling and tasty, and my dog was excited to see me. How could an evening be any more perfect? 


I leashed Alabama and we set out while dusk closed around the neighborhood quickly. The walk was pleasant, it was almost warm outside except for the wind that came every so often and raked nails of ice down my back. I shivered a few times, but the walk was helping to keep my body warm. Darkness seemed to be coming on quickly that night, since the streetlights had come on but children still played in the street. Checking the time revealed it to be just quarter after seven, and I wasn't surprised that the kids were playing in the growing dark. It was still relatively early in the evening. 


I didn't think much about the early onset of night, and the evening walk went as normal. I talked to neighbors, waved at kids, and watched Alabama sniff every object with extreme prejudice. Things didn't get strange until we rounded the corner to the back of the block. This street was connected to each of the fenced in backyards that belonged to the row of houses where I resided. Normally I would hear kids in their yards, or through open windows, and I'd hear dogs, couples fighting, neighbors chatting-- the street was silent. 


Being a 25 year old man doesn't make you brave or fearless, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I was a little freaked out by the dark silence. I noticed that night seemed to have fallen completely, but everything seemed so much darker than usual. My neighborhood look as though someone had been playing the with brightness and contrast controls on a television. Spots of darkness were absolute, and shapes within the darkness were practically indistinguishable. I didn't want to be outside anymore, even Alabama seemed wary.


Alabama may be only three, but he's smart. He was a puppy given to me by my childhood best friend, Ryan. Alabama was the only pup that his older dog gave birth to, and he was excited to have another dog that would live past the time when he lost Sandy. Sandy was the mother of Alabama, but she was old and constantly had issues which brought her to the vet. In a random twist of fate, Ryan met a girl who he decided to get an apartment with. No pets allowed. He gave me Alabama, who was still less than a year old, and gave Sandy back to his parents. Everyone was satisfied with the deal. 


Alabama has become very protective over my friends and I, so seeing him acting as though he was preparing for a fight freaked me out even more. I wasn't sure where the ominous feeling in the air had come from, but it weighed down on me heavily. I felt a moment of panic as I struggled to catch my breath while the sensation of being suffocated overcame me. I made a quick decision, as we neared the gate to my backyard I quickly unlatched the gate and brought Alabama into our yard.


I thought maybe the feeling would dissipate if we got off the street, but if anything it was only stronger now. I fell to my knees and clutched at my chest, I couldn't force my lungs to inhale. I heard Alabama whimper, and watched as he took tentative steps towards the corner of the yard. I couldn't see what awaited him in the shadows, but he stopped a few feet away from the unnatural darkness that consumed the corner. Then he barked, and suddenly the feeling was gone. 


I laid my back on the ground as I gasped for air, my lungs ached. I could still hear Alabama barking at something. I hoped that he was just paranoid and that he'd already chased off whatever had given me such a reaction. I have no idea what could have caused this, but I think Alabama saved my life that night. 


I told Kaylee and Jack about what had happened when I returned, but they didn't believe me. Apparently I hadn't arrived home until after 9pm. Somehow I had been stuck in my yard suffocating for over an hour, yet it seemed like only minutes. I didn't bring up the subject again, they were upset about my late return. I felt bad, but so incredibly confused. What happened back there? 


Later that night I woke to the sound of barking. I had hoped to put the strange incident from behind the house out of my mind, hoping it would never happen again. The barking gave me a moment of panic, and I clutched at my throat as though it would prevent another round of oxygen deprivation. Nothing happened after the barking, except more barking. By the time I had realized I wasn't in danger and should check on my dog, I wasn't the only one awake. 


I ran into Jack in the kitchen, he was staring through the glass sliding doors trying to locate whatever Alabama had been barking at. I looked myself and saw nothing. Jack confirmed that there was nothing there, but the dog hadn't stopped yet. He stood in one spot, staring intently at one corner of the backyard. The same corner as before.


I knew Jack would be annoyed if I brought up my unexplainable experience at 2am, especially while the dog barked so loudly that it was deafening to stand in the kitchen. Jack and I moved to the hallway. 


What do we do about that? He asked.


Ignore it, or try to put her in another room so that she can't see out the back door? 


Jack wasn't one for directly ignoring things that had obvious solutions. We put the leash on Alabama and had to literally push him away from the door. I took him to my room and closed the door, he slept in here fairly often anyways. The barking stopped for the night and everyone was relieved. 


Four nights after that was when I decided that Alabama should stay closed in my room every night. Every time it got dark outside and everyone went to bed, he would start barking at the empty yard. At this point I hard shrugged off my weird incident as a panic attack. I had simply gotten myself extremely worked up for nothing, and it seemed to have caused a negative impact on my pet. 


We didn't get a single night of silence. The first night that Alabama spent entirely in our room started out nicely. We both went to sleep, Kaylee wasn't staying the night so I let the dog in the bed with me. In the middle of the night I awoke to his panicked barks. He was standing on his hind legs, his front paws held him upright against the window. The window that faced the backyard. I glanced out the window and sighed-- nothing there. I moved him into the bathroom for the night after nearly an hour of attempting to calm him had failed. 


Jack didn't look impressed when I found him in the kitchen the next morning. He suggested that I bring Alabama to a vet to get checked out, the barking was driving him up the wall. Maybe my panic attack had traumatized my dog, surely a vet could figure out the issue. That's what I did. A few days later he was diagnosed and given anti anxiety medication. 


We had to wait to see if they would help, and so the barking continued. It had been just over a week since this all began, and now Alabama wasn't the only one in the house acting strange. 


After he took the medication for the first time things changed. He stopped barking at the backyard, and began barking at a corner in the kitchen. I figured that just *maybe* this was progress towards fixing him. When I got ready to take him for his evening walk he freaked out. He *did not* want to leave the house. We ended up finally getting outside after much struggle, but when we rounded the block and passed by our backyard, he stopped to growl at our gate. I assumed the medication had side effects.


We arrived back at the house to hear yelling from the kitchen. Apparently Kaylee had shown up while I was out, and now I could hear her shouting Jack's name. I was confused by the scene when I went to check on them. 


Jack stood perfectly rigid in front of the stove, staring intently at an empty corner of the room. He nodded periodically, as though he was listening to someone. That someone obviously wasn't Kaylee, who was trying to snap him out of his trance. I had no idea what was going on, and as I stood there I watched Jack suddenly move.


After another nod he raised one hand so that it hovered over a pot of something that was boiling on the stove. Kaylee tried to grab his arm, I tried to get across the kitchen to push him away-- we weren't fast enough. Jack's hand plunged into the boiling liquid, and he stayed emotionless for several moments. Kaylee and I froze, I suppose neither of us knew how to react. 


The seconds that passed felt like years, and when the screaming began I found myself stunned again. Jack pulled his hand from the pot, screaming in agony. He looked around the room as though he was seeking out the person who had done this to him. I stared at his hand, the skin was red and already blistered. It looked painful and grotesque. He ran to the sink and turned on the cold water, wincing as he let it run over his scalded hand. 


What the fuck? He stared at us, looking for an explanation about his injury. 


You just zoned out and stuck your hand in a boiling pot! Kaylee shouted, her face was pale from witnessing the event, What are you even asking?! 


Jack looked confused, What, really? I nodded when he looked to me, confirming Kaylee's version of events. I don't remember. I was just getting dinner ready, and then all of a sudden you were both here.. And my hand.. Fuck, I need to go to the hospital. 


None of us knew what to say after that. We didn't know how to talk about what happened, and we weren't even sure *what* had happened. Jack called a friend to drive him to the hospital since Kaylee had an early class and I was going to drive her. He didn't want us to waste our night waiting on him to get his hand checked out. 


Jack left, Kaylee and I watched TV like nothing happened, and Alabama barked in the kitchen. There was nothing else to do. At some point the dog stopped barking, and we took that opportunity to go to bed. We woke early to more barking. I assumed that Jack was home, but that wasn't the case. Upon checking my phone I found that he was spending the night at the hospital and wouldn't be home until the next evening. 


It wasn't long before the alarm was set to go off, but it was still an unpleasant awakening. I found Alabama barking at a corner in the living room. I sighed and went through the day as normal. Dropped Kaylee off, bought coffee, went to work, came home. Kaylee was there again, she had gotten a ride from a friend, and Jack would be home any time. 


I went inside only to hear whimpering from the dog, Kaylee was on the couch transfixed on something. 


Did you put Alabama in my room? I asked her as I sat beside her. 


She didn't respond, instead she just stared. Upon closer inspection I realized that her daze wasn't caused by something she was watching, she was staring into the empty corner of the living room. I didn't want a repeat of whatever happened to Jack, and panic set in. I grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her until she looked at me. 


What are you *doing?* She looked at me as though I had grown a spare head.


You were just staring off into space, did you hear me talking to you? 


I'm just watching a show, she sighed, Sorry, you know I'm not good at dividing my attention. 


It's okay hun, I didn't know how to make her believe that she had been acting strange, so I let that line of questioning slide for a moment, Did you lock up Alabama? 


She nodded, He kept barking at this corner, she gestured towards the spot-- the same spot that I had seen her staring at, and he wouldn't stop until I put him in there. 


Okay, I paused while I debated my next words, You know, that's the same corner you were looking at when I came in. 


I guess I'd annoyed her, because she took on an irritated tone while she denied my claim. I ended up dropping it entirely, it was going nowhere. This was the first of many similar days. 


I'd get home to find Kaylee staring at the corner, by the third day she was whispering to it. Alabama had to be put in a room any time we were home, or else he'd endlessly bark. After a few days Jack left. He went to go stay with another friend for a bit, he claimed it was just until the medication started working on Alabama. 


I felt like I was going insane. Kaylee was over every day, and she was speaking to the corner more and more. I couldn't make sense of what she was talking about. 


*Almost time, almost?* 


*Are you close? Come closer.*


*I miss you, don't go.* 


*The warm room, you can come.*


*Four more days?* 


It scared me, but every time I confronted her about it she claimed to have no memory of it happening. I was worried about her, but I wasn't sure what to do. I thought about asking if she wanted to go see a doctor about it, but I wouldn't live through a conversation where I implied that she's crazy. I figured that maybe the only way to help would be to provide her with proof. 


Unfortunately I haven't been able to get that proof. I'll come home and hear the whispering, but it stops when I enter the room. She's been acting totally normal around me, but when she's alone in the living room I hear her. I've been at a loss for what to do. 


I've tried asking Jack to come back and help me figure things out, but he refused. Somehow he came to believe that Kaylee and I were responsible for his burn, and that we weren't giving Alabama the medication. He claimed that I was insane and trying to intentionally drive him out of the house. Nothing I could say would convince him otherwise, he thought it was all just a tactic to freak him out and keep him away. He wasn't coming back. 


Now I need some serious help, because I'm not sure what to do other than leave. The issue with leaving is that Kaylee won't go. She hasn't left the house at all in two days, and her secret whispers have become more frequent. I found her whispering to a corner in my bedroom last night. 


*One more night?* 


*I'm so happy you're here.*


*I'll wait for you.* 


I haven't been able to put Alabama in my room since then, he's been barking at the new corner and whimpering at the bedroom door when we keep him out. 


I'm not sure what to do guys, but whatever my girlfriend has been whispering with will be here soon.

<TEXT> Here's my opinions: 

Loved your Hell series, that was really awesome! There's a lot of ways to do a series, you could go anthology style but since you said that the first series would be *required* reading, I'm not sure if it's the same.

I'm currently doing an anthology type thing, and though it's not required to read the original post, things make more sense when you have everything. 

What I've been doing is linking all related posts at the bottom of the original post, and then I'm going to just have the link to the original and most recent related posts on the future parts.

Because it's not a traditional "must read in this order" series, I never flagged it. You can read one part and walk away, or you can dive in and find all your heart desires and await more. Also, there are four confirmed posts that relate to each other and all of them have done very well. They don't have a singular title though, because I wanted it to be apparent to anyone new to the story that there is no set start point. This is also why my links are at the bottom of the stories, so that you're not deterred by the fact that it's part of a bigger picture. 

If you want it to be an entire spin-off series, I'd give it a title that hints back at  "How to Survive In Hell" so that it might attract fans of the first one, but still have a relatively original title for the new series. 

Orrrr, if I'm way off track and you mean one singular post set in the same universe as the Hell series, then definitely a unique title. If you want it to be able to stand alone without *mandatorily* the series, then I might suggest not relying too heavily on huge plot points from the original post and instead being vague when something like that happens. Enough to maintain the immersion, but still make a reader who is unsure of what you're referencing curious to learn more.

**TLDR;** If it's not mandatory to read the series beforehand, then link it at the bottom. If it is mandatory, link at top.

 I'm not entirely sure what's going on or how the narrator is posting when they're repeating a day over ten years ago. (But I may have just missed something). 

Your writing is good IMO, there's the minor mistakes like not capitalizing the letter i at one spot, and little typos that are hardly even noticable.

<TEXT> At this point, only if you were to become a Shade or you attract attention from one of them and they decide one way or another to involve you in the Shade world. 

You could make a friend who wants you to know the world as it truly is, or you could accidentally anger the wrong person and end up in literal pieces days later. 

Edit: Oh and as for learning more, there are a lot of people who have posted on here speaking of either guests at the hotel, or the same types of Shades we've had as guests. They're unlikely to identify them as Shades though, as I believe that is a hotel nickname.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as she's told me, "a little bit of this and that".

From what I've learned while being here she's obviously some part Shapeshifter. When I first got here I learned the Latin name that was given to her by other Shades, which translates roughly into "Charming Mutt".

She has said before that she is the only one of her kind, and that her mother was slightly different but also a very unique creature. 

From everything I've gathered by talking to her and seeing her own posts online this is what I've got:

Some part Shapeshifter (due to body changing) 

Some part Siren/Other water creature (She usually takes her victims underwater to consume their souls, as far as I know. As well as the hypnotic quality her singing has. 

Some part Demon. (She's clever, sly, and incredibly convincing. Her eyes occasionally turn into inky black pools, a trait I've seen only in Shades that are some part demon.) </TEXT>

<TITLE> I've Been Speaking With My Shower Head </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-10 01:34:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not quite sure where to start when I describe what happened. I suppose the easiest thing would be the day it all began. 


I had just finished unpacking everything in my new apartment after living there for several weeks. The place wasn't great, it wasn't the closest to the fun spots in the city, and it certainly wasn't in the nice part of town. It was old, and honestly kind of run down. Twelve stories high and at least one of the two elevators was guaranteed to be out of order on any given day. 


The nearest stores included a convenience store, a pharmacy, and a pizza shop. As far as I was concerned the apartment had two key upsides: the price was decent, and those few stores on the corner would do me fine when I was too busy to take a twenty minute bus ride to a real grocery store. I had a great first few weeks at the place, the violence in the area was a little alarming but I felt safe enough while in my apartment. 


That started to change one night. I was in the shower when I started hearing a strange distorted sound. It sounded almost like a man sobbing. I turned off the water so I could hear better, which led me to the discovery that the sound was coming from the shower head. It stopped for a moment before I heard a long sigh and retreating footsteps. Suffice to say I was a little weirded out. 


I thought that perhaps sound travelled easily through the outdated plumbing. For a while after I wondered vaguely who I may have heard through the pipes, but I ended up forgetting all about the incident. It didn't stay off of my mind for long though, because I had a similar occurrence a few days later. 


I could hear muffled noises again and shut the water off to listen in, I don't know what made me so curious. I was disgusted to realize that the sounds I had previously thought were sobs were instead groans. I could hear some guy getting off. I didn't bother finishing my shower, I felt odd from so deeply invading someone's privacy. It's not like I intended to listen in on that sort of private moment. 


I sighed at myself, I wouldn't have heard so much if I hadn't been listening in. I pushed it out of my mind promising myself that I would ignore it from now on. I tried, but it seemed that whoever was in the other end of the pipes decided otherwise. The voice in my shower started talking to me. It got more and more frequent, like he suddenly realized that I could hear him and decided that he should bother me excessively. 


It started with him just pouring out random stories about his day, I could hear him speaking but no other voice replied. It's like he was talking to himself, or talking directly into the pipes to see if anyone would reply. After hearing his voice on and off for a few days I decided to respond to his conversation. That ended up being a mistake, as soon as he knew someone could hear him he would *not shut up*. In the beginning I didn't even respond constantly, but I eventually learned that his constant chatter was almost pleasant when he had someone to reply to. 


I figured he was nuts, talking to some random female voice through the pipes each day. I suppose I seemed insane as well, because I started talking back every time. I had conversations with my shower head daily, the voice on the other end seemed so kind and reasonable. It was an odd way to make a friend, but I'm not a very social person so I take human interaction where I can get it. The man in the pipes described himself to me, not much older than myself and he sounded really nice. He was so humble, it threw me off that someone met in such an invasive way could be such a good person. 


We didn't always talk, some nights I would hear the sounds from the shower head and know that he was busy. I could hear conversations, I couldn't make out the words when I heard them, but I heard distinctly different voices and could understand the gist of the conversation by the tones they spoke in. I heard a lot of girls visit him, almost never the same female voice twice. I'm a little ashamed to admit that I felt kind of jealous. *There is this guy that I talk to every single day who is seemingly perfect and lives in my building, yet he's with fifty girls that aren't me.* 


It was a petty thought, he could still be a creep who happens to get a lot of action. He could be some sort of stalker. Hell, he could even just be playing movies to make me wonder about what I'm hearing. I didn't start wondering if I was truly going insane until he told me I was. That night I was sitting in the empty bathtub with a blanket, talking to my friend through the shower head. The conversation was entirely normal until it wasn't. 


You know you're crazy, right? The voice laughed through the pipes. 


What do you mean? I questioned. 


You're insane, talking to an imaginary voice that comes out of your shower head every day.


I thought over his words for a minute, Are you fucking with me? 


I'm not a real person. I'm a voice in your head that you're desperately clinging to so that you feel less alone. You're alone. There is no one on the other side of the pipes. You're all alone. 


I didn't reply, and he didn't say anything more after that. There was no more voice coming out of my shower head. After having constant conversations for nearly a month I felt conflicted. Was I really going insane? Was it possible that I made up a man speaking to me through my pipes? 


The nights passed almost quietly for a few days, it seemed that only an eerie noise made it's way through the pipes. I couldn't begin to describe it, but it creeped me out. Each night the sounds coming from the pipes only seemed to get louder, and I woke up horrified several times at the odd noises coming from the shower head. I heard them in my dreams sometimes, the haunting quality of the sound coming out of my bathroom made the perfect soundtrack to change any pleasant dream into a nightmare. 


After nearly four nights I finally got irritated enough to contact the landlord about the noise. I questioned if the pipes carried sounds from other apartments, or if there was some sort of error when they renovated the building before I moved in. I was sick of the chilling sounds I heard each night. 


I was told that he didn't have the answers to my questions at that time and he'd come by and look into it, but there was nothing he could do about it until morning. That night had to be one of the worst, the noises seemed almost like howls of pain and it became the soundtrack to my home all night. I heard a noise that sounded almost like distorted laughter, and for some reason found myself truly afraid. 


I turned on the news to drown out the sounds from the pipes, and hopefully calm myself down a bit. The news was relatively calm, except for a small update on an ongoing story. *Young women in the city continue to go missing. Police have no suspects at this time, and have been unable to find any links between the victims. More on this after weather and the break.* 


I sat there stunned as the weather report played in the background. I couldn't help but feel incredibly paranoid about the sounds I heard from my shower head. I changed the channel before the story came back on, I didn't want to make myself worry any more than I needed to. I was up until nearly dawn channel flicking, afraid of the nightmares that would plague me when sleep finally hit. 


I ended up sleeping most of that day away, my body was exhausted from being so freaked out the night before. I awoke to the sound of knocking at my door. It was mid afternoon, a time when I would normally be wondering what I wanted to make for dinner. I was practically half asleep when I answered the door, and I was entirely unprepared for what awaited me on the other side. 


I spoke to two police officers that evening, instantly becoming fully awake and alert when they explained to me why they wanted to ask me questions. There was a man renting out the apartment below me, an apartment which appeared to contain rain barrels that collected water from a few sources in the building. They believed my house was one of the sources. 


I told the officers about everything I heard through the shower head, but didn't find out until days later what I was technically involved with. 


The man renting the apartment turned out to be the son of the owner of the company which did all the updated plumbing for the building. He also happened to be the person who oversaw several pipe installations that drained used water from the bathtubs into the barrels in his apartment. Due to evidence found in the apartment, they believed he may be involved with the girls who have gone missing around the city. 


Over the last few weeks I've seen his face on the news, he honestly is very attractive. When people who knew him described him it seemed he was exactly the kind of person I'd assumed when we had conversations through the pipes. I felt a little guilty for having been attracted to a guy who might be a serial killer. I don't know why he said all of those things through the pipes. 


They never told us why he was collecting the used water from various apartments, and they haven't caught him yet.

<TEXT> Some of the guests used to be human, so they enjoy speaking with someone who is still human but is aware that they are not. They don't have to pretend to still be human and can feel at ease talking to someone who is living the way they would had if they hadn't been changed. 

Some of them are humans who have been dead for quite a while, so they enjoy updates on the world through someone who is still living in it as a human. 

The singing is another thing that is also commonly requested by those Shades who were once human. They request a natural human voice to sing things they haven't heard out loud for any number of years. Most of the other employees have some sort of voice "modification" that humans don't, so they don't always produce the desired effect that a guest may be looking for. 

There are many Shade guests that have human visitors or companions with them at the hotel, but the majority of our human guests are entirely unaware and kept away from our Shade guests. Different floors and everything. 

There are a select few human guests who are already highly aware of the Shade presence in the world, they are kept especially safe from any harm other guests may do, and they are not subjected to the memory removal process that other guests go through.

Most Shades that I have encountered don't actually hate humans at all. Some of them like them a lot actually, they like to watch human lives play out and see what we deem important in our lives. They like to learn about us, live with us, or they need us to maintain their own lives. They aren't all murderous, and they don't all eat to kill.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> During my break I just tried to live life normally. I worked on getting regular sleep, but I still had nightmares about things from the hotel. I received a message from the Good Shade each day asking if I had decided to leave or stay. 

I tried to spend time with my friends, spent a few nights out on the town with everyone. I was just so paranoid. The stories I'd heard from the hotel made it impossible to rule out any of the strangers around me as Shades. 

I didn't want to go back to a life where I wasn't aware of how much danger surrounded me, so on the last day of my break I let Mister Smith know that I'd be coming back for another quarter.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> A Delivery to the Good Shade Hotel </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-09 00:50:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm currently working my second interval at this hotel. Every interval is three months, and during the time off you have two weeks where you can decide to stay or quit. I haven't really thought about quitting since back when I first started, I honestly really enjoy working here. It has really opened up my life and allowed me to witness and experience a world few ever see. A world where we're aware of the Shades.


I didn't take a lot of time to think about quitting during my break, I was too excited about all the things I was learning by working here. I'm nearly to the end of my second three months, and something just happened that I'll definitely be keeping in mind when I have the chance to quit. 


A few nights ago everything was going as normal-- or at least as *normal* as it can get around here. I was sitting at the front desk talking to Alphaeas most recent persona, Chiara. Beautiful as always, she was petite and 53. She sported olive toned skin, and highlighted deep auburn hair. She smiled sweetly from behind the desk as I came back from helping a guest. 


Hey Tyler, Mister Smith needs you to do him a favor, She told me, her bright blue eyes widened as she waited for my reply. 


Sure thing, is he in the office? I asked. 


She nodded at me, and seemed to be trying to hide her amusement. I guess she knew what I had to do and found it funny, or she knew how confused I would be when I received the task. Either one would be exactly in her character. I tried to prepare myself so that Chiara couldn't laugh at me, if I just handled the job and got it done well enough then she'd have no reason to chastise me when I returned. 


Mister Smith did not seem impressed when I entered his office. He gestured for me to have a seat and began speaking after a sigh. 


I'm sorry to have to ask you, Mister Stephens, but all of our other employees are tied up, and with a guest we have scheduled to arrive this evening Alphaea must remain at the front desk. 


Alright, I replied hesitantly, What do you need me to do? 


There is a delivery for the hotel that needs to be picked up. You will drive there in one of our hotel vehicles, exchange vehicles at the delivery pick up location, and return the delivery to the hotel, He stared at me as though this was the most serious matter on the earth. 


I can do that, I told him. 


There are some requirements. You cannot look in the delivery vehicle to see what you are carrying. You are not to unlock the back of the vehicle, and please do not ask any questions about what you are collecting. 


I nodded, moderately concerned about what it could be that I was delivering. He told me what car to take and gave me the keys, the GPS was already set to show me the way to the pick up location. Chiara wiggled her fingers in a goodbye as I walked by the front desk to leave. She had a knowing smile on her face, but I didn't want to give her the satisfaction of admitting that I was freaking out on the inside. 


The car was plain and silver, the kind if car that you see absolutely everywhere. The drive towards the delivery was quiet and dark. I had nothing but time to think on the hour and a half long drive. *I could be picking up guests. I could be picking up raw meat, or large dead animals. I could be picking up corpses.* I panicked the entire way there, I had no desire to find out what the consequence would be if I were to peek at what I was delivering. 


Arriving at the location of the switch brought me to a small dirt road in a dark wooded area. Suffice to say this did nothing to ease my worried mind. Two suited men exited the Uhaul truck that was parked there. As I stood outside in the cold one of them instructed me to drive as I would normally so that I would not be pulled over. They got in the hotel car and left. 


It took me a few moments to clear my head and remind myself to ignore whatever it was I had to deliver. I steeled myself for the journey ahead as I got in the driver's seat and noticed that the GPS in the truck already had the destination set for me. *This is a simple task. They've made it so easy for you.* I let out a breath that I didn't realize I was holding as I started the truck and drove away. 


I tried to distract myself from the task at hand by listening to the radio, but no stations were coming in clearly. The voices distorted by static would somehow manage to slip their way into my already hotel ravaged nightmares. The car was quiet, and according to the GPS I was only about 15 minutes away from my destination. Unfortunately that was when I started hearing noises coming from the back of the truck. 


Banging, muffled shouts, and crying. A panicked thought crossed my mind, *I'm delivering live people.* I sped up, my delayed start must have messed up the schedule set for the passengers to sleep. I didn't know why they were being delivered, if they were human or Shade, and I didn't want to know. I couldn't come up with any peaceful reason that I might be taking a shipment of people to the hotel. I knew that these people likely wouldn't enjoy their stays at the Good Shade. 


It was none of my business. I got back to the hotel at record speed, and Mister Smith awaited me by where I was instructed to park. He asked some follow-up questions to be sure I hadn't tampered with the delivery, then sent me on my way. I was sure Chiara could tell I was freaked out when I sat behind the desk. I couldn't stop thinking about what I'd done, *am I a criminal now? Did I just commit human trafficking?* 


Hey, earth to Tyler? Chiara waved a hand in front of my face. 


I snapped out of my panicked state, Um, yea? Sorry.


How was the drive? She asked with an eyebrow raised at me. 


It was okay, I replied vaguely, still trying to avoid her mocking me. 


Great! She smiled widely, An incoming guest has requested a human bring the bedding to the room prior to arrival. 


I nodded, and she gave me the room key and directions, Room is U12-54, the requested bedding is located on the storage floor, U1. Take the second elevator, don't be too long.


I hoped a simple walk to place some bedding for a guest might calm me down, but Chiara had an odd look on her face when she gave me this task. She knew something I didn't know-- as usual. I used the card to get down to the underground storage floor, a place I had never been previously. The floor looked just as nice as any of the ones that actually housed guests. It was clean, well lit, and looked like a regular floor overall. The one major difference to this floor was the set of doors to the left of the elevators. This led to the basement laundry room and linen storage. 


I grabbed a small cart to place the bedding in and loaded everything I could possibly need to make a guest's bed. As I was leaving the room I noticed a group of people coming out of the storage elevator located at the back of the hotel. I recognized several hotel employees who seemed to be escorting these people into different rooms on the storage floor. I willed the elevator to get here faster and take me to the guest room, I didn't want to think about where those people came from. 


After I got back into the elevator and headed down to the guest room things went smoothly. I got the bed made in record time, spent less than a minute on the storage floor to return the laundry cart, and made my way back to the front desk with confidence. Chiara looked exhausted. 


You okay? I asked her. 


She sighed, High-maintenance guest tonight. We'll probably be giving a lot of requested room service tonight.


I wasn't concerned about it at that point. It wasn't the first time a guest had requested a human to deliver their room service since I'd been working here. Requested service meant great tips for escorting a person, food, or items to a guest. It wouldn't be so bad. The night was fairly uneventful until we began receiving room service requests. Chiara had to provide escort for me to the room each time, it was hotel regulation. There were a few simple requests for drinks and such, but every so often there would be a request to bring up a friend. 


Each time the guest requested a friend, Chiara made a call and another employee would escort in a person. We would then take that person to the guest. This happened three or four times during the shift, and I became concerned when none of the people returned from the room. I couldn't imagine what this guest might want so many people for. The worst part was, I recognized those people as part of the group I had seen entering the hotel through the service elevator. 


The delivery was eating me up inside, and before the shift ended I had to ask. Chiara and I were sitting at the front desk waiting for another request. 


Did I deliver people to be eaten by guests? I blurted out into the otherwise quiet lobby. 


What? Alice laughed, Obviously you're aware that you did deliver people, but not specifically to be eaten.


I stared at her, she was acting as if this should be obvious to me. 


She rolled her eyes, They either owe something or have done something and are being brought in for the hotel to take care of, or they were requested by a guest to be delivered for whatever purpose they wish.


I had no idea how to respond to that. How does the hotel *take care of* the people who have done it wrong? Also, *whatever purpose* does not rule out people being eaten. The rest of the shift kind of went by in a blur, I was exhausted from the continuous nightmares that working here afforded me. The stressful shift did nothing but add to my exhaustion and I went by the last of it on autopilot. 


It's almost time for me to go to tonight's shift. I remember Chiara saying one thing while I was zoned out, one thing that stuck with me. One thing that might always remain true. 


Youve been here for what feels like so long, yet you still hardly know anything about the Good Shade.

<TITLE> I Thought it Was an April Fools Joke </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-08 00:15:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was sick of the day, of the cold and the rain. I was tired of the coworkers pranking each other in honor of a childish holiday. Work was chaotic with everyone acting crazy, and I ended up leaving early for the day. No one seemed to care, the day was already lacking in productivity. 


I thought it was another April Fools joke when I got to my house to find my usual parking space filled by the car of my best friend. I silently thanked living in the middle of nowhere for the unlimited parking space it provided. I parked in the driveway and entered the house, steeling myself against any pranks that might await me. 


Instead I heard the noise of muffled groans coming from the master bedroom. For a brief moment I hoped harder than I ever had that a joke was being played on me. Maybe she was pretending to be some stranger and they'd both pop out when I went in the bedroom and laugh at me for thinking something mischievous was going on. 


They didn't notice me in the doorway, and I backed away from the room where my best friend straddled my boyfriend. I felt sick to my stomach, and absolutely enraged. I walked quietly to the coat closet and pulled out the shotgun we kept in there. I walked back into the bedroom as I loaded the gun the way my boyfriend had shown me. 


They noticed me standing in the doorway as I aimed the gun in their direction. Alexis panicked and pulled the sheets up to cover herself. 


Ricky, what the fuck? She glared at him as though *she* was the one who had been cheated on. 


He looked around the room at a loss for words for a moment, Katherine, I told you this morning we were *through*.


He looked both angry and afraid as he stared at the gun in my hands. I thought over my stressful morning, lazily swinging the gun back and forth to point at them each one at a time. Alexis spoke again. 


Kate, cmon. This is a joke right? You *had* to see this coming--


Whatever other words she had planned to say died on her lips as I pulled the trigger. Tears ran down my face as I watched her traitorous body slump over. The shot shook my small frame, and I was shocked that I remained standing in place. I leveled the gun again to point at my boyfriend. 


He pleaded for his life, claiming he'd do anything I wanted. I had him spend the next few digging a grave for Alexis, and it was dark by the time he dropped her body in the hole. I still held the gun, and I aimed it at his back as he let her body fall. He stumbled into the grave with her, screaming in pain as he landed. He had just finished his whimpering by the time I filled the hole in enough to cover his head. It took a while, but I once again was thankful for being so far from neighbors as I shoveled dirt. 


It was nearly 4am by the time I got the grave filled in. I roamed through the house to find the keys to Alexiss car. I drove it until I was out of state and in a dark alley. I removed the plates and left the keys inside the car. I had to take a bus back to the town nearest to my house, and it gave me a lot of time to think about what I'd done. 


Over the last few months I had noticed Alexis and Ricky becoming friendlier towards each other, but I didn't think much of it. On the morning of April Fools I had been sitting at my desk when I received the texts from Ricky. 


*I can't do this anymore. I'm tired of pretending.*


*Katherine I'm leaving, for Alexis.*


*We all knew this was coming, could you respond?*


I ignored the texts, I figured they were a joke and didn't want to complain about it while I was dealing with everything going on at work. By the time I got home I had forgotten about the texts, but seeing Alexis's car in the driveway had renewed the feeling that I was part of an elaborate joke. 


I thought it was a joke until the moment I saw them in bed. Then I broke, it wasn't a joke at all. 


It's been a few days and I find myself wishing I had known it wasn't a joke. I would still be alone, but I wouldn't have to stare at the patch of dirt behind my house that holds the bodies of my two closest friends. 


What can I say? I've always hated April Fools Day.

<TITLE> It All Started With A Game of Would You Rather </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-06 22:46:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It all started with a friendly game of WYR. For those of you who may not know, Would You Rather is a game where you pick something you'd rather do out of two options. They can be simple and innocent, sometimes they're sexual, sometimes they're boring, and sometimes they're just plain weird. 


I was in an online chat room talking to some friends when one of them brought up another room. It was a room entirely for games of Would You Rather, called *RatherIndeed*. A group of us decided to head over and play, it was something to pass the time. 


They started out weird but it made the game interesting, the bot in the room shot out questions to each player one at a time. It was like any other game of WYR. I don't remember everything about the game, except that it didn't last long with all of our joking in between questions. 


*Would you rather have your body only intake liquid in the form of grape soda or MelloYello for the rest of your life?* 


*Would you rather have to sing every word you say or never speak again?*


*Would you rather witness the death of someone you love or blind yourself?*


*Would you rather have every piece of meat you touched rot, or never be able to eat meat again?* 


*Would you rather have horrifying predictions of your friends dying every time you tried to sleep, or never sleep again?*


We all made random choices from the compilation of weird selections, but I remember it being funny to see everyone explain why they made the choice they did. We laughed about how ridiculous it would be if we were to find ourselves in a situation where we actually *had* to make such insane choices. 


We only had enough time to go once through everyone in the room, by then half of us were tired and other people in the main chat room were starting to leave as well. We all left *RatherIndeed* entertained but also a little weirded out, some of those selections were apparently made for complete psychopaths. I went to sleep that night and had awful nightmares about some of the options from the WYR game. I ended up waking an hour before my alarm and spending the entire day exhausted. 


By the time I got home from work I was too tired to sign in and chat, I decided to take a nap but that ended up being shorter than intended. I woke up about an hour later and figured I had time to pop in and say hello while I made dinner. Emily was on video complaining of an annoying cough she was developing, Glen was flooding the text chat with some nonsense I was too tired to actually pay attention to, Alex was complaining about something being wrong with the lunch he bought earlier, and Kristy was nowhere to be found. 


It was an average night, despite the absence of Kristy. We all chatted and joked around until we got tired or busy and left the room. Over the next week things got weird for everyone. I could hardly sleep, each night I had nightmares that I couldn't fall back asleep after. Each night that passed resulted in me sleeping less and less. 


Every day in that I came into the chat room everyone seemed worse as well. Emily had gone from a mild cough to a painful and violent one that shook her entire body, her throat was raw from the force behind each cough. Glen had some type of flu, he couldn't keep any liquids down. Every time he had a drink, he violently expelled it seconds after he swallowed. Alex began thinking the meat he'd had at lunch last week had somehow been tainted and was now ruining other meat for him. He couldn't stomach any meat, it all tasted spoiled. Kristy still hadn't come back to the room. 


We asked Alex about her, since they were engaged but still living long distance. He showed us their texts from earlier that day, he seemed concerned. 


*A: Hey babe, you okay? Haven't been talking much lately.*


*K: I just can't look at you! I don't want to see or talk to anyone right now.*


*A: What are you talking about?* 


*K: I keep having these dreams of you and all of our friends dying.* 


*A: I'm sorry honey, is there anything I can do?*


*K: Stay away from me.*


*A: How am I supposed to do that? For how long?*


*K: I don't know! Forever maybe. I can't stand looking at you.*


*A: I'm sorry*


*K: It's not your fault. I'm sorry, I'll talk to you later? I have an idea about how I can fix this.*


*A: Okay, I love you.* 


She hadn't responded to the last text, and I felt bad for him. I wasn't sure why she would be acting so odd. Kristy and Alex are the most perfect couple I've ever known, surely this wasn't her pushing him away. None of us really knew what to tell him about the texts except for the standard, *I'm sorry, it'll be okay. Tell her we miss her.*


Everyone was so miserable, we hardly participated in the regular group chat with everyone else. We all ended up fading out early, promising to say hi again the next day. I didn't sleep at all that night, the nightmares came immediately as my eyes closed. 


When I signed into the chat the next evening and was exhausted and irritable. My mood perked up when I saw Kristy was on video, the room was happy to hear from her again. She spoke excitedly to everyone, and several of us joined her on video. I noticed that Glen was drinking several two-liter bottles of MelloYello while he was on video. 


Dont you think that's a bit excessive? I asked him. 


Its the only thing that hasn't made me sick, He explained.


I suggested he see a doctor about bring dehydrated, and the night continued on pleasantly. Everyone was happy, but Kristy began complaining of a pounding headache. When we suggested that she go lay down and rest, she replied very sadly. 


I just wanted to make sure I got to see everyone at least one last time.


Everyone started questioning what she meant, but instead of answering any of us she clutched her face in her hands and started screaming. 


I don't want to see this anymore! She cried out as she dug her nails into her eyes. 

Before anyone recovered from the surprising change in mood, Kristy grabbed a pen from the desk she sat at. There was a moment of stunned silence as she hastily drove the pen towards her face, and the sickening sound that came through my computer's speakers will haunt me forever. Panicked messages came rolling into the chat, and several of the people on voice and video call screamed. Kristy responded to nothing as she removed the pen from her eye and stabbed it into the second one. 


People called the police, Alex left to drive the three hours to her house, and everyone in the room who knew her in person rushed out to get to her. No one knew what to say as Kristy sat in front of her camera covered in blood and screaming. I left the room, I couldn't handle looking at her. 


I didn't sleep that night. The real life nightmare played over and over in my head. I couldn't understand what was happening. When morning came around I decided to pop into the room to see how the night ended. 


Apparently the police got an ambulance to Kristy, and Alex ended up meeting her at the hospital. She's still in there recovering and speaking to therapists. They think she's gone crazy. She keeps claiming that she wouldn't stop seeing her friends dying until she couldn't see at all. According to her she was right to do it. 


It's been days since then, maybe weeks. I can't keep track of anything, I don't remember the last time I slept. I can't function well enough to spend an entire day at work, but I've been keeping up with news about my friends from the chat. We've all paid visits to doctors. Emily has to go in for surgery, she got an infection that has actually eaten away at her vocal chords. They're going to try and remove the remaining infection before it spreads anywhere else. She'll likely never be able to speak after. 


Glen went to the hospital and they tried hooking him up to an IV bag, but for some reason his body didn't react well. Apparently he had screamed when the fluids entered his body through the IV, he claimed that it felt like fire burning through his veins. Before they could do anything to help he had a heart attack. They tried to bring him back, but he was gone. 


Alex visited his doctor about the meat making him sick, and the doctor couldn't find any medical reason that may have caused it. He suggested that Alex become a vegetarian, which was a disappointment to him but easy enough to do. It wasn't so bad for him. 


No matter how many prescriptions my doctor gives me, I cannot sleep. I can't stop hallucinating about my friends being torn apart. My entire life has become a waking nightmare and I don't even know what's real anymore. I'm going insane, everything is out to get me. All I want is sleep and it won't come. I'm losing myself. 


I've tried going back to *RatherIndeed* to see if anyone from there had a similar experience and was talking about it, but I couldn't find the room. 


I can't stop thinking about the choices we made, unaware of what we were deciding. 


Glen would rather only intake MelloYello for the rest of his life, Emily would rather never speak again, Kristy would rather blind herself, Alex would rather never be able to eat meat again, and I would rather never sleep again.

<TEXT> I'm out of the country for a month and a half, meaning I can't be online more than once or twice a day, so I have a lot of time to write. 

I was wondering if anyone would like to give me random prompts, literally anything even if it's silly. 

They can be as simple as one word, or as complex as you'd like. I will work throughout my stay to do *every single one.* Upon posting, I will reply to your comment with the link to the story. 

PS; A big hello and thank you to everyone who I've met in the IRC chat, you guys literally have made my days brighter and I'll miss every single one of you until I get back. You are seriously the most amazing, crazy, hilarious and kind people I've ever met!

<TITLE> Loyal To The End </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-01 17:40:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> No one has ever been a best friend to man the way dogs have. Loyal, protective and fluffy little creatures. Maybe not so little, like Doug and I. A man of nearly six feet tall and a fluffy Saint Bernard, we can be an intimidating pair at times. I'm Tim, by the way. 


Doug has been my best friend for a few weeks now. You'd think we'd still be in the adjustment phase both being fully grown, but we adapted to each other quite well. We know each other's feelings and routines. Life was great for us. 


There was one night that changed everything. I was half asleep in the master bedroom, the house was quiet. Doug left the room, he was probably thirsty and headed downstairs for some water. He must have tripped, because I heard a series of loud thumps. 


I ran out of the room to check on him. He lay crumpled at the base of the stairs. There were clearly several broken bones, blood leaked from a source I couldn't see, and I could tell from a distance that his neck was broken. My best friend Doug was dead. My owner, my human, the man who had fed me. 


I felt despair for a moment, I was his pet after all. But this accident meant I wouldn't have to hurt him myself. I shifted out of Tim the Saint Bernard, back into my regular human form. Doug was pathetic, lonely, and adamantly disbelieved anything supernatural. He would have lost it if he had lived until I made my move. His redeeming trait was the fact that he was very wealthy. 


No one hides things from their dogs, they're loyal friends, they *can't* rob you blind. Unless they're like me. 


Loyal until your end. Woof woof.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Strange Things Happen in Louisiana </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-01 07:27:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There's a lot to be said about small towns in Louisiana, but that's not important. Most people who aren't from around here don't listen seriously to the things I say anyways. They don't understand that I'm not crazy, lying, or stupid. I know what I'm talking about though, it's the type of thing that's *almost* considered normal around here. 


Let me start from the beginning-- the beginning of that day at least. It started out good, I stepped out of my bed and my foot landed on something cold. Lifting my foot revealed a penny-- heads up! I smiled to myself, *my lucky day.* I checked my mailbox as I was leaving and was hit with another happy surprise, the check from my tax return was sent to me earlier than expected. 


I stopped at a coffee shop on my way to work, and discovered that they had just brought back the delicious chocolate lattes they used to have. Better yet, the person in line before me had paid for everyone else in line! This morning was positively serendipitous, I'd never had such a lucky string of events happen to me. It didn't stop there. 


When I arrived at my dad's flower shop I was happy to find that we had received a new supply of bleeding hearts, it's been months since we'd had them in stock. My dad always forgets to order them, but they're my absolute favorite. 


Morning daddy! I greeted him while I inspected the bleeding hearts, You finally remembered? 


Sorry darlin, wasn't me, He shrugged, Seems someone had em sent for us.


I nodded happily, we've had locals do such kind things before. Working at a flower shop is always so nice and peaceful, everyone in town stops by to get flowers and ask about Mister Time. I work there with my dad and my sister Liz, a family run business as long as it's been open. 


I was flying through my morning routine of tidying, setting up arrangements and displays, and answering calls. I had thought my day was wonderful already, but then I answered a call from a familiar voice. 


Hello, Freeman's Flowers, how might I help you? I said cheerfully as I picked up the phone. 


Um, Elizabeth? Don't tell Anna I'm doing this okay? He said hesitantly. 


*He* being Damien Dappa, the boy I've had a crush on since elementary school. We were good friends, and I was a little surprised he mistook me for my sister over the phone. I was too curious to correct him, and Liz wasn't here today. 


Sure thing, this is Damien, right? I said. 


Mhm, do you guys have those heart flowers yet? She's been talking about them forever.


We just got some in today! I replied, probably sounding a little too excited. 


Great! Can you send them to her in a pot? I think she'd like it better if they didn't die. I don't want her to know they're from me though, 


Sure can, leavin a note? I asked. 


Yea, can you write I know how much you love these, D.D? 


I nearly laughed at his idea of anonymity, there was likely not another person in town with his initials, and if there was I had no idea who they might be. I confirmed his order, and let him know that they'd be sent out this afternoon when dad did the deliveries. By the time the call ended I was happier than a kid in a candy store. 


It was nearly noon by that point, which meant I had to go check on Mister Time. He was a *gift* of sorts, given to the shop when my mama was still around. She was special, and that part of her was sent into me when she passed. The cancer got her good, a tragedy for the whole town. Everyone loved mama, she was an honest and kind woman. She tried to get Lady Priestess to help her, she was so afraid after she told is Mister Time had shown her face, but Lady Priestess couldn't cure cancer. 


Before she passed only her and Lady Priestess could talk to Mister Time. Lady Priestess isn't her real name, but no one knows anything else to call her by. I swear she's been around longer than the town itself, but she's a mysterious magic practicer. She's the one who gave us Mister Time, she said she needed a break from caring after him. 


Mister Time is an oddity himself. He lay in an open casket in the back of our shop, and mama insisted that he loves flowers so we bring him a different one each day. He doesn't have a face-- not always that is. He lay there in his dark grey pinstriped suit, and the head above his shoulders bears the features of a mannequin. There's all the hills and valleys of a regular face, but the skin is seamless. No eyelids to blink, no lips to open, no nostrils to breathe. Sealed up tight. 


Visiting him is usually easy, I always leave with news that'll break someone's heart, but the town is comforted by knowing what's coming. Gives us time to prepare. The thing about Mister Time is that sometimes he lets me see a face, that's how he talks. He doesn't say anything, but the face he uses tells me everything I need to know. It's the next person who will die in town. 


He can't tell me how they go, or when they go, so all I know is *who* will go. He only tells one a time, the face repeating each day until the person no longer exists. Every time someone dies our shop gets a rush of traffic the next day. Everyone wants to be the first to hear what Mister Time told me. 



Besides Lady Priestess and myself, everyone else in town could only see the seamless face he wears. That's why he's here, Lady Priestess was tired of holding the responsibility. We can't stop telling people what he reveals, the town has gone crazy before over it. It's an accepted fact of life here, we always know who's next. I don't mind doing it, I've become fond of Mister Time. 


I brought him bleeding hearts that day, and greeted him cheerfully. I always spoke to him, just like mama would. I told him about the flowers, and how I'd had such a joyful stroke of luck that day. When I asked him about his day his response ruined my lucky streak. 


He wore my face. I asked if he was sure, but the face remained the same. I felt sick, and thanked him for letting me know before I left the shop early. I didn't want to spend my day telling the town that I was going to die. The longest anyone's ever lived after being shown is about a year. I'd be incredibly lucky to make it that far. 


I hid in my house all day, and when my flower delivery arrived I burst into tears. Bleeding hearts seemed appropriate for my day. Everything had gone from amazing to awful. 


I composed myself by the next day, getting back into my regular swing. I wanted to make the most of the time I haf left. When people asked about Mister Time, I told them. I got so many pity filled looks, but I ignored them. I wasn't going to be brought down by this. There was something I kept from the town, I didn't want to scare them. 


Each day since seeing myself in Mister Time, my visits got worse. This had never happened before. As each day passed the face he wore became more mutilated. I was shocked every time, it wasn't a progressive deterioration. Every visit brought a different form of horror. One day I had no eyes, another day featured my skin melted, and yet another showed my lips sewn shut. At that point I realized that I needed to tell someone about this. 


Lady Priestess was the only one I could go to, she was the only one who knew the details of dark magic. Calling her gave me a huge revelation. 


Lady Priestess? I asked when the call was answered. 


Yes child? She replied calmly. 


It's Annabelle Freeman, I'm sure you've heard of what Mister Time has told? She made a noise of agreement in response, I need help, I pleaded. 


I explained to her the horrifying things I'd seen. 


Ah, I've seen a similar case. Your mama came to me the same as you.


I was shocked, Mama had cancer, why would she come to you?


She saw similar such things, she told everyone it was cancer, but I'm the nearest to a doctor she saw. Somethin else was eating her from the inside, She sounded thoughtful as she said it. 


Can you help me?


I can do for you what I did for your mama, come see me, She hung up right after. 


I did end up going to see her, but for all her spells and rituals I've only become sick. I've asked her who will take my place with Mister Time, and she's told me that it will pass through the women of my family. When I'm gone, Elizabeth will carry on talking to Mister Time. 


I'm afraid though, Lady Priestess has placed some sort of spell on me. I can't directly tell anyone in town about her healing. I can't make my fingers write or type the words, I can't force my tongue to form them. My only saving grace is here, where no one in the town roams, where Lady Priestess would never find. 


She visits my home, I've become bedridden most days. Each day I see her she looks younger, just slightly. I feel myself getting weak, and I swear I've aged more each time I see my reflection. Something is *very* wrong with what Lady Priestess is doing. 


There's a reason Lady Priestess has lived longer than anyone in town knows.

<TEXT> The worst thing I have ever been

Was when I was a Princess

Because you were the King

My title never meant a thing

Bestowed me a crown, 

A gift to yourself

To prove you were kind

To everyone else 

It's all about you

It's all just a show 

"Look what I've done, 

I'm perfect, justly so!"

Anything you will do 

To boast your own name 

As for your children? 

They were pawns in game

"Pity me, for they left! 

Pity me, I'm alone! 

I did nothing wrong, 

They abandoned their home!" 

We're all pawns, we're all planets 

You are self-dubbed the Sun 

For without us in orbit

Narcissism hasn't won

Sit on your false throne 

Claim yourself as righteous King 

Believe the worlds orbit you

Though you're really nothing

<TEXT>  Also keep in mind that pure introductory posts can be removed for not having enough horror. I recently wrote a series that is ~13k words split into three parts. 

My first post had to be removed and edited because it was too much of an intro without a decent amount of horror. It went from ~2k words to 5k words, putting half of what I planned to be a second part into the first post. 

Don't think too deeply on leaving a cliffhanger, anything can be a cliffhanger to someone who is anxiously awaiting the next part because the first one had them hooked. 

Also remember that each update post needs a minimum of 1k words. Long posts in a series are good, they keep a reader more satisfied until the next part comes out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lol my most recent series starts with finding a journal in the basement of a house that caught fire. Shot fired. Not really, but I'm curious on your perspective. 

I can see how it would get "boring" to read a lot of stories around the same time with the similar element, but there are different ways to use it that make the story good/original. 

Does the diary thing in total annoy you? 

Or: 

Posts almost entirely detailing the contents of the diary. The diary *is* the story. 

Posts where creepy things happen after finding the diary, but it's not the center piece of *everything*. It just happens to contain some relevant info about the situation. 

Posts where the diary is cursed or something. It *causes* the main action in the story, it's evil. 

Posts where the diary holds all the answers to the weird things going on. It's a means of gathering answers to questions and problems in the story. 

Or all of the above? 

I guess my real question is, is it the use of a diary a framing/plot device in general, or is it the *way* you're seeing it used?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Decent human staff are hard to come by, it's more unsafe to be a guest. I'm easy to kill, but a lot of the guests like to have a human around for various reasons. 

My contract has me working for a minimum of three months. Every three months I have the option to go through an *almost* painless process to remove any recollection of the hotel and the things I've witnessed. If I try to quit before an interval, the process is apparently quite unpleasant. I'm not supposed to speak about the hotel, tell anyone where it located, or give any information about the guests who stay here. 

I'm also not supposed to question the guests too intensely. A question here and there is allowed, or information they willingly share with me, but pestering about their species, lifestyle, eating habits, etcetera is frowned upon and could get me into trouble. 

A loophole in the contract allows me to post here, because most of the world outside this forum believe that everyone here is telling tales of fiction. I am advised not to touch the guests, not to seek out any "enhancement" a guest may offer me, not to enter the room alone with a guest who is not of species, but to honor any request a guest might give me within my limitations. 

Including but not limited to: Donating blood, letting a guest watch me for certain periods of time, dressing in specific attire and having a conversation with a guest, allowing the guests to smell me, singing to the guests, bringing food and other items to the rooms, and various other tasks. 

The contract states that the hotel will do everything in it's power to make sure I do not "expire" during any shift that I work, and that they will provide me with the means to cure any negative side effects from coming into close contact with a guest. 

There's many other things, but those are some of the main points. There is also the benefit of a 50% pay increase every time I choose to remain an extra three months.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I made a mistake there, getting only three correct was only possible in the instances where we were betting on one person to live, if that person died but you guessed the order correctly your money was doubled. If they were the last alive and stayed alive, that's when it could triple.

<TEXT> I did make an error there, four correct only stands in the instances where one person gets to live. If the final person dies, then you've only gotten the first three correct and your money was doubled.

<TEXT> I'll bet you $150 that Trent kills himself before we graduate, I looked to my best friend, awaiting his response to the wager. 


What the fuck? Are you serious? He's not even the type. 


Yea, why not? Bet me, you're on the side that gets paid if he lives. You're not doing anything wrong, I shrugged, the bet wasn't a big deal. 


He ended up agreeing to the deal, I'm sure he forgot about it after a while. I didn't though. The news came about six months before we graduated, nearly a year after the wager was made. Trent Nguyen had shot himself in his bedroom. I wasn't happy about the news, but I had seen it coming. Call me horrible if you wish, I'm not the one who killed him. 


There wasn't anything I could do to stop it, he was completely fine until the first month of our senior year. Things visibly went downhill from there. His grades were slipping, he wasn't allowed to play at any of the games because of it, and his girlfriend left him for another guy. Sure, he was obviously becoming depressed, but he had tons of people trying to help him. He was surrounded by friends, family, and counselors. It wasn't enough to combat his dark thoughts. 


I waited a few weeks before confronting Danny about the debt he owed me, I didn't want to seem insensitive. Suffice to say he was pissed that I brought it up. I hated to pester people, but he *owed* me. You make a bet, you pay up when you lose. It's the way gambling works. I nagged at him every so often, reminding him that the conversation about the terms of our wager was recorded. By the end of the year he gave in, he didn't want me telling people that we had placed a bet on someone's life. 


Here's your money, James, He shoved an envelope full of bills at me, Not just for the debt, I put in an extra $50 so you could do me a favor. 


I nodded as I counted the money in the envelope, And what would this favor be?


Never talk to me again. You're seriously a sociopath. 


Sure thing, I shrugged, I would have wagered that our friendship would die out in college anyways. 


I was $200 richer and one friend less. It didn't matter, I didn't need him. He always judged me for my interest in gambling, and I am *not* a sociopath. I just enjoy winning, no matter what the game is. Some may say I have a gambling problem, but I think it's more of a skill.


Over the years I've gotten pretty decent at the games, but cards and chips get monotonous. People are what makes for interesting bets. I'm great at reading people. Most of the time I can tell a lot about a person just from having an encounter or two. When it came down to predicting the actions of a person, I was almost always right. There's always variables that can ruin a bet though, not every gamble is a win. 


I started betting at work. *Dana will quit her job in less than two months. Mikes wife is cheating on him while he's here. The new guy is going to freak out by next week.* The office wagers were fun, I was always a winner. Eventually even that got boring though, it was too easy to win. 


That's why when a coworker gave me an address of a high risk, high pay event, I showed up without question. It was shady, and run by an organization that called themselves *Limited Life Wagers*. The location changes every time a new event occurs, and for good reason. What took place at these events was nowhere near legal. 


The amount of people at the venue surprised me, apparently these events were quite popular. I wasn't sure what we were going to be betting on, but the crowd got me excited. There was a stage set up at the front of the room and the audience members pushed and shoved to get close. I was wary, I wanted to see what kind of game they were playing before I thought about placing a wager. 


A voice called out for silence and the room quickly fell into a hush. The curtain opened, revealing a man in a mask, behind him sat four cages. It was hard to see from my position but there seemed to be *people* in the cages. Now this was definitely piquing my interest. 


The masked man spoke, Welcome, let's start with an introduction for the newcomers.


All noise in the room had ceased, you could only hear the sound of the audience breathing during the dramatic pause. 


Minimum wager is five thousand dollars. We do not accept checks. We have associates in the back to provide cash loans if you did not come prepared. If you do not plan on placing a bet tonight, please leave now. 


He took a break as he waited for the audience to either produce the money or leave. I decided that it would be worth it to try this out at least once. I moved to the back and received my $5000 loan. A few minutes later the masked man spoke once again. 


Please place your wagers in an envelope, and write your name and the amount on the front, Another pause, There we go! As I continue, attendants will come around and collect your envelopes, and your hand will be stamped. Now as for what we'll be betting on tonight, He gestured at the cages behind him. 


The speech that followed detailed the contents of each cage. They were all people who were at the end of their rope, for some reason or another they had given up on life. I wasn't sure how they ended up here, but I honestly didn't care. 


The game was simple. These people would be held captive and subjected to torture, they already hated their lives anyways. They would be offered the chance to end their suffering at thirty minute intervals. The last one to off themselves would have a large sum of money anonymously donated to someone in their life that they had picked in advance. 


The bets were what I found to be the most appealing part. Predict which order they would die in. One correct would get your money back, two would multiply it by 1.5, after that your money was doubled and then tripled. These people were *hopeless*, betting against them wasn't wrong. This was exactly up my alley, reading other people's misery was so easy. 


That first night was simple, attendants came around to record everyone's predictions, and within a few hours the game was over. My money had doubled and I was hooked. For months this was the only manner of gambling I took part in, there was a downside though. The torture aspect made the predictions harder, you never knew what would break a person. 


For months I watched all manners of abuse break down these people. Waterboarding, brandings, nails and teeth yanked out, bloodletting, and even dismemberment. The lengths were extreme, and I kept overestimating my ability to predict the outcome of the games. I found myself owing a debt of nearly $100k to *Limited Life Wagers.* 


The organization gave me one option to pay my debt, and I'm going to take it. I'm pretty good at predicting people, and I think I can make it through. In all honesty, I think they rig the bets. I've noticed lately that a lot of people who have placed wagers have also ended up on the stage. Those games are the most interesting, one person gets to live and collect 90% of the money from the losing bets. That's a huge haul on any given night. 


I'm going up on that stage tonight, and I'm actually *thrilled* about it. I could make more than enough money to pay off my debt, hell maybe I'll go up a few extra times to earn some guaranteed cash. Though, I think I've realized something. 


I have a serious gambling problem. 

**Edit:** As several of you have pointed out, I made an error when describing the winnings. Here's some clarification. 

Correct on the first death: Money back. 

Correct on the first two: 1.5 x your wager. 

Correct on 3+: Double. 

For the games where one was left alive, your money would be tripled *only* if the person you bet on living didn't die as well. 

There has been a few instances where the person intended to live couldn't handle the thought of living with their mutilations, or for some other reason did not make it until the evening was over.

<TEXT> After the day ended I received more information about him. 

He claimed to be a preacher, but was in fact a Shade the entire time. He lied to the men to bring them to the hotel full of "demons", the men thought he intended to help wipe demons from the earth, but he only wanted a decent sized group to murder. 

His entire goal was to bring victims so that the hotel guests could massacre them as a group. The rules of the hotel were starting becoming more strict, and he wanted to prove that you couldn't deny Shades of their desires. 

That day has become a tradition. No human guests are safe, and the rules are lax for the holiday. They've done this to appease the Shade guests, so that massacres of such a magnitude will only take place once per year on hotel property.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Happy Apocalypse Day! Diana greeted me cheerfully from behind the front desk. 


*What now?* I had been working at the Good Shade for several weeks at this point, and had just started to become accustomed to all the things that go on. I could finally check-in guests, and I was learning more about the types of *people* that stayed in the hotel. Not all of them were bad, but most were terrifying. 


I was already starting to lose track of how many times a guest had *smelled* me. On the bright side, apparently my scent is delicious. Perhaps not the best compliment, considering it's probably something that would make me more likely to end up a victim. Diana didn't seem too impressed when she saw such a thing occur to me for the first time. 


A tall, pale woman had entered the hotel a few days after I started the job. She looked like death-- literally. She was beautiful in a dark way, and I found myself compelled to walk up to her as soon as our eyes met. Long black hair cascaded down her back, matching in color with her eyes. If the grim reaper was personified as a gorgeous woman, then that's what I was staring at. 


She was as tall as me, a surprising attribute considering that I'm 61. She leaned close to me as I came to a halt in front of her. Her lips hovered mere centimetres away from my neck, and her breath felt cold on my skin. I trembled due to the fear of what she may be, but also because I was suddenly awash with a deep lust for her. She laughed, a deep and alluring sound as she backed away. 


You smell delicious, young man, She purred as she walked around me. 


I didn't trust my legs to walk, so I simply stared as she took long graceful steps towards Alice. 


Marise, he's new. Don't play with the staff, Alice chastised her. 


Shame, it gets lonely at the hotel. 


No it doesn't, Alice laughed, You bring in more unregistered guests than anyone else. You keep turning people and there will be none left to feed on.


Abruptly I felt the rush of desire leave my body, leaving only the traces of fear. I walked hesitantly up to the women, and Marise glanced at me with a pout. 


What if I get hungry? The pout transformed into a smile, revealing her sharp elongated canines. 


Alice sighed, You know Smith provides for the guests, and I've already asked you once not to mess with our new staff member. Get out of his head. 


Marise shrugged and broke her gaze with me. I stood there confused until she left with her room key. 


Don't let the guests play with your head, Alice scolded me once Marise was out of sight. 


What do you mean? I questioned, still confused about the encounter. 


The desire, her teeth? She does it to everyone. It's not real, you have to steel yourself mentally so that it's not so easy for Shades to get in your head.


I nodded, What about her teeth? 


You think mine are scary? Hers are just plain hideous, but almost equally as dangerous. 


I took what she had told me into account, and have worked on locking down my brain since then. By the time Apocalypse Day arrived I had a minor grasp on how to protect my mind, but at the same time I was plagued with nightmares of jagged teeth. I came into work that evening exhausted, the nightmares had made sleep nearly impossible. 


Apocalypse Day? I questioned with a yawn. 


It's a sort of holiday at the hotel. I mean, if holidays meant a ton of extra work, She was vigorously typing things into the computer as she spoke, Thats the downfall of being in the hotel business though. It makes for an interesting night at least.


I watched as she pushed chestnut colored hair away from her tanned face. She was pretty this way, short and curvy with dark green eyes. She noticed me staring. 


What? 


I'm just not used to Diana yet, what was wrong with Alice? 


Nothing, I just needed to change bodies so I could move on undetected, She shrugged at me as though it was the most obvious thing in the world. 


I'm not sure if I'll ever get used to Alphaea switching names and bodies, it was definitely confusing the first time she came in as Diana. I nodded in understanding at her explanation, but wished she would let me call her by a single name. She requested that I call her by the name of the body so that she wouldn't slip up around other humans. I doubt she ever slips up though, I'm pretty sure she just gets a laugh out of my confusion. 


So what exactly is this so-called holiday? I got back on task, not wanting to be blindsided tonight. 


Years ago-- back in the time of Al Capone-- there was a group of men who thought themselves Demon Hunters, She glanced up from the screen to make sure I was paying attention, Their leader led them to believe the apocalypse was imminent. He brought them here on the claim that this hotel was run by demons. 


I listened intently, her tone made it obvious that their visit to the Good Shade didn't end well. 


I'll tell you the rest later, She cut the story short as two young men entered the hotel. 


Hi, welcome to the Good Shade hotel, She smiled sweetly at the new guests. 


Damn, this place is pretty remote, The taller of the pair spoke, Stumbled on it by luck.


Mhmm, we don't advertise much, The edges of her smile tightened as though she knew what would come next. 


So is the place where that massacre happened? Do you know where they died? He asked casually as they walked up to the desk. 


I took in their appearances, they seemed almost normal. The taller guy sported short blonde hair, he had an arrogant air about him. The shorter one had dark hair, and he practically dragged the bags he was weighted down with. He didn't seem to be as thrilled about being here as his friend was. 


Do you need a room for the night? Diana ignored his question. 


Can you tell me what happened that night? It's the anniversary you know, those men came into this forest, The blonde ignored her in return. 


She rolled her eyes, Do I look old enough to remember that? 


Fine, whatever, we'll take a room. Can we film here, and in the area? He sighed and gestured to the bags. 


The other guests probably won't want to be on camera, but do what you want without bothering anyone. Names for the room, please, She was typing the booking into the computer as she spoke. 


I'm Eric, my friend here is Tim. I'm actually doing research on a mass killing that hasn't been publicized, He leaned in like he was expecting this would get her to talk. 


I take it that means you didn't come here because you found some sort of advertisement or invitation? 


Eric simply shrugged, apparently annoyed by the lack of information Diana offered. She held out a key card silently, and gripped his hand when he reached for it. 


Only use the third elevator, don't leave your room after 11pm, and enjoy your stay in room 217, She smiled, her eyes seemed to turn into deep black pools as she stared into him. 


He yanked his hand away and began walking, Crazy. Cmon Tim, let's go set up in the room.


She frowned, *Not long enough,* She muttered under her breath, Tyler, will you make sure those two make it to their room okay? Third elevator only. The other staff aren't here yet. 


I nodded and quickly jogged to catch up with the men near the elevators. They were trying to enter the wrong one. Eric seemed frustrated, while Tim seemed slightly scared. 


Swiping your key card will only work on the correct elevator, I told them. 


We moved to the third elevator, and I took a few of the heavy bags from Tim. As soon as we entered the elevator Eric began speaking again. 


So, do you know about the massacre? He asked me. 


I'm pretty new here, you're the first person to mention it, I replied. 


He told the story as we made our way to the room. Apparently this occurred almost a hundred years ago, most of the story was small town rumor. A group of men had followed a preacher out into the woods, they believed he was leading them to stop the apocalypse. As the tale goes, the men never came back and their families believed something in the woods had killed the entire group. No one knew where exactly the men had gone, and there has been conspiracy theories about it being a cult that committed a group suicide. 


Variations of the story included the men finding a haunted building and being tortured by malevolent forces, or the preacher turning on them and slaughtering the group. The only solid fact that Eric had was that this forest was the one where the men had disappeared. 


I nodded and made understanding noises at the right moments, this information seemed to coincide with what Diana had been telling me before. I helped them bring the bags into the room, and was about to leave when a question popped into my head. 


Why are you filming at the hotel? 


This is the only place around for miles, no one has ever heard of it, and everyone who has come looking for answers has gone missing. When we stumbled upon this place I figured someone here must know what's going on.


Maybe, I muttered halfheartedly. 


*Oh the people here know what's going on,* I thought. *Why else would they celebrate a holiday called Apocalypse Day?* 


When I returned to the lobby Diana gave me a curious look, Learn anything interesting from your fellow humans?


I suppose, I shrugged, knowing she didn't plan on enlightening me any further. 


I didn't have much time to dwell on the fact that she was leaving me clueless yet again. Guests seemed to pour into the hotel in an endless stream. Human and Shade alike came to stay. It wasn't uncommon to have human guests, people like to roam the forest and are always relieved to find that there's somewhere to rest. None of them remember the hotel once they leave, we have staff that make sure of that. 


The influx in guests was apparently due to the holiday. Half the human guests were out ghost hunting for the missing men, and I wasn't sure what about this day appealed to the Shades. By the time we had gotten the flood of guests into their rooms it was almost 11pm. I was entirely exhausted at this point, and couldn't keep my eyes from closing as I took a seat behind the desk. 


I awoke a short time later to the sound of a disagreement. 


You need to go back to your room, Diana said sternly. 


I was still half asleep and hardly heard the response from a familiar male voice. I stood, trying to collect myself, and saw a group of people enter the hotel. Diana noticed that I was awake. 


Take care of the guests, She barked at me as she took Eric's arm and led him away quickly. 


The group was made up of about ten men, and they seemed angry. It only took a moment of them crying out for redemption upon demons before I recognized who they must be. I couldn't pinpoint which of them might be the so-called preacher. As they got closer I faced a horrifying realization. They were all obviously Shades, and they were mutilated beyond belief. 


Suit sleeves dangled limply, lacking arms to fill them. It was a near sea of red, blood splatter could be found in abundance on each one of them. Eyeless sockets, mouths sewn shut, limbs snapped and mangled, and missing chunks of flesh. These men had been brutally torn apart. I was used to seeing awful things, but hadn't yet witnessed anything of this magnitude. I stood staring, absolutely shocked by the scene in front of me. The gruesome visual was paired with a soundtrack of enraged shouts. 


Demons come forth!


We shall end the bringers of the apocalypse!


The night of your reckoning has come!


My stupefied state was interrupted by the sound of elevator doors opening. A tall man in a pristine black suit came over and stood in front of the gruesome mob. 


My followers, welcome to the reckoning! He gave an eerie smile to the group, who responded by dropping to their knees. 


They sang out praises and gratitude, the man who stood before them was their preacher. By this point a throng of guests had heard the commotion and crowded around the edges of the lobby. The humans were easy to distinguish, they bore panicked expressions and some even screamed at the sight. Other guests held on to them and kept them from running away. 


Friends, The man gestured towards the edges of the room, Let history repeat itself, Apocalypse Day has arrived! 


He laughed like a madman, and the room was suddenly chaotic. Shades descended upon the human guests, tearing them apart or dragging them away. The preacher ran through the room, laughing as his razor sharp nails cut through his flock of mutilated followers. The men dissipated when he made the violent contact, but the blood and screams were not lost. The guests kept the sound alive as they tore each other apart. 


I was backed against the wall behind the front desk, shivering with fear. The guests had gone crazy, this place wasn't *safe.* I don't know how I could have thought I would get used to being around such murderous creatures. Suddenly Diana was besides me, blood dripped from her shark-like teeth and ran down her chin. She looked at me with curiosity, but her eyes were inky black pools. I shrunk away from her. 


She rolled her eyes at me, I had to take care of Eric, he was getting too aggressive while asking about the hotel. I see the festivities have started. 


I stared at her speechless, and she seemed to suddenly realize the depth of my fear. 


This is what the holiday is for, a cheat day of you will. The guests go wild to celebrate the massacre. Not a great day for your kind, but you're safe. You're with me, I'll protect you, She said reassuringly as the darkness faded from her eyes, but the fresh blood dripping from her chin didn't make me feel any better. 


She hooked her arm through mine as we watched the brutal chaos surround us. I couldn't help but feel afraid that she'd suddenly turn on me, I wasn't sure if she was safe to be near. As if the universe had set out to prove me wrong, someone clutched at my free arm and tried to pull me into the disaster. 


Diana bared her teeth at the woman holding my arm, This one is *mine,* She growled in an inhuman voice. 


The stranger backed away, returning to the grotesque show. We sat there and watched until the violence died down and the guests had returned to their rooms. The lobby was awash with blood and bits of flesh, and I felt sick to my stomach. Diana patted me on the back as she stood. 


Congratulations, you've made it through your first hotel holiday, She smiled, Your shift is being extended. We need to check in the morning to see how many guests we lost.


I hesitated before speaking, unsure if my voice would work, Won't people come looking for them?


We have people to take care of that, and people to clean all of this up. Everything is fine, it's just another day at the hotel. You should get some sleep before we check the rooms in a few hours.


I laid down on the soft couch in the office, but I couldn't sleep. I'd never get the scene I witnessed out of my head, and I feared for my life more now than I ever had before. *Just another day? How was this considered a holiday?* I was so exhausted that I couldn't keep my eyes open, and I fell asleep to fearful thoughts. 


How was I supposed to stay sane when I still had nearly two months left on my contract? How was I supposed to get used to their idea of holidays? I didn't understand how they could be so nonchalant about massacring guests. I felt a deep sadness for the human guests who had thought this hotel was a safe haven amidst a dangerous forest. 


This place might end up being the death of me, and every time something crazy like this happens I flash back to the words I was told on my first day. 


*You'll see much worse, trust me.* 


Those words still remain true. Apocalypse Day may have been violent and gruesome, but it wasn't the most terrifying night of the job.

<TEXT> I assume by the dates on the receipts, even if you were ordering one thing he always took it down on the pad and put those handwritten receipts under the register after ringing them up. 

Probably just kept tabs on who came in more than a few times and counted up their receipts. That's what my guess is at least, they didn't find a huge amount of bodies so I'm guessing it's not often that someone comes in 47 times.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I Was Almost In The Lucky 47 Club </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Jack Meyer was the nicest man I ever knew. He ran an ice cream shop in our neighborhood, and everyone flocked to it year round. He never closed for cold season, partly because it wasn't *that* cold around here and partly because some people crave ice cream mid winter. He was kind to every one of his customers. He was fair on prices, and even gave discounts for larger families-- like mine. 


He was an all around good guy, and he loved making people smile. He hand-churned all of the ice cream he sold, and worked hard to keep his shop open and pristine. Mr Meyer's wife died a few years ago, and since then he's been working hard and running the shop all on his own. Sad story that one was, she had a heart attack on their 47th anniversary. Their love story was adorable. 


That anniversary wasn't for their wedding, it was for the day they went on their first date. They were young lovers-- extremely young-- and had been living next door to each other for their entire lives. As the story goes, a 6 year old Jack asked the 8 year old May out for a picnic in his backyard. Best friends for years afterwards, and their official relationship began in their early teens. I remember how old Miss May would blush when he told people that story. 


*Oh Jack, that was ages ago! It doesn't count!* 


*Of course it does, I swear that was the day I fell in love with you.* 


The whole neighborhood was distraught when they'd heard of May Meyer's death. She was the sweetest woman, part of what had always made the little shop so pleasant. She made my first visit to the shop a happy and memorable one. 


*Hello there young man, who might you be?* 


*I'm Joshua Shepherd,* My young face had smiled up at her. 


*You can call me Miss May, what can we get you?* 


I ordered ice cream for myself and two of my younger sisters who were waiting at a table by the door. I had to run back and ask what kind of ice cream the girls wanted, and Miss May waited patiently for me to return. Mr Meyer scooped up three cones and passed them to May, who handed them to me with a grin. 


*Free of charge,* She smiled. 


I stared at her in awe, never knowing a free treat in my life. She shooed me away with a hand gesture and another grin, and I've never forgotten that small act of kindness. The only reason our parents had sent us off to the shop that day was so that they could fight over finances in private, and my mother seemed both surprised and relieved when we arrived home without spending a penny. I think Miss Mays kind gesture was part of the reason that we splurged a few times a year and bought the whole family ice cream at once. 


Things changed after Miss May passed away, but Jack has always kept a pleasant atmosphere about the shop. The biggest change was her absence, but a notable difference was his new promotion. It was pretty special since it wasn't advertised. On your 46th visit to his store you'd find out that your next visit was free. 


A few weeks ago I hit visit number 46. When Mr Meyer revealed to me that my next visit would be free I was ecstatic, and when he asked me not to advertise it I agreed. Not that the cost was expensive for me-- since I'm living alone and have a decent paying job now-- but I enjoyed being part of something special. I forgot about my free visit until a few days ago, and that's when I realized the significance. The odd number was in honor of his late wife, and it gave me warm thoughts. *How sweet, it's just like Mr Meyer to still be doing kind acts in memory of Miss May.* 


The idea of a free visit brought back my fond memories of Miss May, and I was excited to be a part of honoring her kind soul. I decided to head into the shop the next evening, I didn't want to forget about the special visit. Jack's face lit up as I entered the shop. 


Josh! He exclaimed happily, Lucky number 47!


Hey Mister Meyer, thanks for the free visit, I smiled at him, his joy was contagious. 


Not just a free visit, young man, I also have a surprise! Can't tell anyone bout your visit though, don't want them young ones getting greedy and coming in more just to be in the Lucky 47 club. 


I was excited about whatever he considered a surprise. No one ever talked about having a 47th visit, likely out of respect for Mr Meyers request. I liked that it was a surprise. It's no fun to destroy a nice gesture with greed, it was the random and surprising nature that made visit 47 so much like something Miss May would have done. This deal he offered was not about saving money, it was about honoring her. 


He explained to me the surprise, a serving of a flavor he had created in honor of May called Lucky 47, and the opportunity to come behind the counter and learn how he churned the ice cream. At the end of the visit I would be dubbed an official member of the secretive Lucky 47 club. Suffice to say I was thrilled at the idea of adding the new memory of the shop to the similar memories from when I was young. 


Now I'll give you a bigger serving than normal, you're probably the eldest I ever had become a Lucky 47, He chuckled, but I knew I was an oddity for coming back to the neighborhood I had grown up in just for some nostalgic ice cream. 


He served up a big bowl of the flavor, and set off behind the counter to clean up before it was time to close. I was excited about the portion sizing, it was the biggest I had ever seen anyone get from the shop in the near 12 years I'd been coming here. The ice cream was delicious, a creamy French vanilla with swirls of fudge and chunks of toffee. I couldn't pinpoint what else was put into it, but the aftertaste was odd. Mr Meyer had just gone into the back of the shop to fetch something when I bit into something odd. 


Upon spitting the hard object into my palm I was concerned-- it was a piece of a tooth. I figured the toffee had chipped one of mine, so ran my tongue around my mouth searching for the broken tooth. No dice. I checked with my finger and still found no jagged edge. It suddenly dawned on me that the tooth that I had spit out did not belong to me. I was disgusted and desperately wanted to leave without embarrassing Mr Meyer. He always took great pride in his product, and would be devastated to learn that there had been a major mistake made in this batch. 


*How do you even accidentally drop a piece of a tooth in your ice cream?* It wasn't impossible, but it was repulsive enough for me to bail out on the rest of the Lucky 47 perks. I stood to leave and a wave of dizziness washed over me. Instantly I had an intense feeling of something being *very* wrong in the shop. 


I stumbled towards the door, my vision blurring as my body swayed uncontrollably. I heard heavy footsteps approaching from the back of the shop. 


Hey boy, you didn't finish your ice cream! The footsteps quickened towards me, and I tried to speed up my own tipsy steps. 


I may have been nearly forty years younger than him, but whatever he had put in Lucky 47 was leveling the playing field. Being younger and stronger didn't matter when every movement felt like swimming through wet cement. Before he caught up to me I managed to wrench open the door to the shop and fall onto the pavement face first. 


I had blacked out as I hit the ground, and I later came to in the hospital with a crowd of doctors and police surrounding me. Questions and confusion berated me throughout my stay and the few days since I've been back home. I've told the police about my experience, and how kind Mr Meyer had always been to everyone. 


Since that day I've heard rumors and seen news reports about Mr Meyer's shop. The shop has been shut down, Jack Meyer is missing, and they found several bodies stored in the back freezer with the ice cream. They were all young, kids and teens who had gone missing in the years since May Meyer died. I can only assume that something snapped in Mr Meyer when his wife died. 


I suppose it makes sense that word never spread about Jack Meyer's secret Lucky 47 club, no one lived long enough to tell.

<TITLE> My Sister Didn't Exist Until I Found Her Journal (Final) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-26 00:08:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This journey starts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5zys6i/my_sister_didnt_exist_until_i_found_her_journal/) and continues [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/60niox/my_sister_didnt_exist_until_i_found_her_journal/). 


Apologies for the delay, I've had to work on relocating myself after the incidents that have occurred and meeting my sister. All of that is elaborated upon below, and I believe this is the last time I'll bother you with my story. I'll pick up where I left off. 


----


We decided that one of the other girls would call the police if Allison hadnt contacted us by morning. We didnt want another false report ruining our credibility. In the case that things went entirely wrong, we'd need to be able to go to them for help. If she didnt contact us by morning, then itd be unusual behavior for her. Shes lost her phone and taken off with guys in the middle of the night a few too many times in the past. We had to hope it was one of those instances until shed be gone longer than normal. Then we could involve the police.


So we hurried back inside to the make the call, it was getting late and we didnt want to have to wait another twenty four hours. Once inside I set the phone on speaker in the middle of the table, the girls sat patiently beside me as we dialed. One ring. He answered right away.


Ah, Lilith, its been awhile! He greeted cheerfully.


Dont call me that, its not my name.


Of course it is, no matter if you dont appreciate it. Funny in your situation, is it not? 


What? I didn't understand what could possibly be humorous about the situation at this point. 


Come now child, your mother was a biblical woman, you have learned enough about demons, have you not? 


Im not sure what youre talking about, I replied hesitantly. 


Well, in your reincarnated case, things are not as you may have read them. Mother of demons, created to rule. Seems an unfortunate act of Fate had your polarizing figure created as a sister. You love each other, now that is what makes the situation hilarious, He chuckled at his own statement. 


I honestly have no clue what any of that gibberish means. 


His voice took on a cold tone, Child, it is not gibberish. You are as human as I, as the ones you believed to be your parents for so long. You are the next leader, you are the one who will reign in the End. 


I was skeptical about what he was claiming, but I figured playing along was the only way to get more information, If Im the ruler of.. Demons? I began hesitantly. 


Mhmm, 


Then why are there others trying to kill me?


Ah now, asking appropriate questions, Fair Lady. You are widely considered too weak to rule, your affection for your sister was well known, even as she was wiped from your memories, it remained. Quite the cause of controversy, though there are few who believe it would make for an interesting ruler. He sounded satisfied that I had asked for the information. 


And those are the people who have been following me? I questioned.


Oh no, our kind wouldnt be so blatantly careless while tracking you, those are humans. They seek to destroy you before you awaken, He said it as though he just told me it was going to be sunny tomorrow, so nonchalant and unconcerned. 


Oh.. I had no idea what to say, I wasnt even sure if I should believe any of what he was telling me. 


Yes, yes. On another note, all of your memories should be restored, Eve was quite wise about the journal when she snuck back to that house to place it. Smart little thing since she awoke. 


Wait, what? His mention of the journal piqued my curiosity. 


All in due time child, youve only got about four months before you awaken. Use your time wisely, dont let the humans get to you. You should be strong enough by now to deal with your own kind. He sounded so pleased with himself, and the call suddenly went silent. 


I stared at the phone for a moment, unsure of why he ended the call so abruptly. I looked at my roommates sitting around me, they looked incredibly concerned. 


So, that guy is absolutely nuts? Maya said with a nervous laugh, her eyes darted around as though she was afraid someone would hear. 


Um, yea.. I looked her over, she seemed to flinch away when I spoke, *what the fuck?* All that stuff was super crazy, doesnt make any sense. 


She nodded and spoke softly, Mmm yea, Im going to go lie down. Its late. Get some sleep guys, that call was super weird.


She got up and walked away, and I looked to Raven for some reassurance. She put a finger to her lips and gestured towards our bedroom, I followed in quietly. 


What do you think? I whispered to her. 


I think Maya is fucking terrified of you, and I dont quite believe that guy was crazy. It all kind of makes sense, doesnt it? She didnt look scared, she looked concerned, as though she was worried the flood of information would break me. 


Im pretty sure that Im human, I pulled at the edge of my shirt nervously, the words sounded false when I said them.


Really? Because youre hot as *hell*, She smiled at her joke, and I elbowed her softly.


She was trying to lighten the mood, which was a nice contrast from Mayas reaction. I curled into her on the bed, trying to clear my head and think about the phone call rationally. *Lilith and Eve*, honestly everyone just thought it was cute when we were younger, named of the two first women. What kind of joke had my life become? Midnight had definitely been right about things being different from what I learned as a child. 


I didnt fully understand how this could be anywhere near true, wouldnt I know if I wasnt human? I thought back over my life as I laid there, noting all of the times that people seemed irrationally wary of me. Id had a fair amount of friends though, I attracted people, Ive been told that Im charming. The revelation set in deeper as I realized all the ways people had described me in the past. *Charming, sly, smart, alluring, reckless, daring.* Theres so many other words that have been used, but thinking back on all Ive ever known about demons, it sure seemed that I had the traits of one. Im not evil though. Ive never had the desire to hurt someone, or do anything awful. Maybe slightly rambunctious, with the sneaking around and my past romantic relationships. 


I sighed and curled in deeper to Raven, suddenly feeling cold. Maybe I wouldnt know until the supposed Awakening. Maybe I was just freaking myself out over the ramblings of a madman. I fell asleep curled up there, pondering over my entire life and how it was not what I'd thought. 



I woke up the next morning late for class. I decided to skip for the day, it seemed well deserved after all the craziness. I walked into the living area of the apartment planning to grab myself some coffee so that I could clear my thoughts and figure out what to do next. I noticed that Mayas door was ajar as I walked by, peeking through the opening showed that she was absent from her room. She wasnt in the apartment at all, but I assumed at first that she might have classes that day. 


I went to get my drink and noticed the laptop sitting open on the table. An email was open, with a video attachment. I clicked the attachment and was shocked. Allison was in the video, she was tied to a chair, in the middle of some sort of chalk circle. The floor was covered in odd markings. A group of hooded people surrounded her, chanting in a foreign language that Im fairly sure was Latin. Isnt it always Latin? 


The chanting ended and nothing happened, a few of the hoods look towards each other as though confused. A tall feminine figure with a face hidden by the hood of a red sweater stepped forward from the group of surrounding people. I stopped the video, and called for Raven. A feeling of deep unease was settling throughout my body, and I didnt want to be alone. We sat down together and continued the video. 


The red hooded woman walked to the edge of the room and picked up two things, a wooden box and a gallon jug full of liquid. The horror set in at this point, and I realized I was about to witness something that couldnt be unseen. I couldn't bring myself to stop watching though. The woman walked back over to the chair and set the box beneath it, then she proceeded to pour the contents of the jug all over Allison's body. She started screaming, she knew what was about to happen. 


The woman stepped back into the circle of people, and they all took a step backwards to widen the circle. A short chant began, and suddenly the box was lit. I clutched my face in my hands so that I wouldnt see Allison burned alive, but I could still hear her agonized screams. The sound abruptly cut off, and I looked up to see Raven fastforwarding the video. 


When it began playing again the fire had stopped, and the hooded people were dragging the smoking body away. I didnt understand how a fire could burn in such a way, it wasnt natural. The red hooded woman walked up to the camera, removing her hood to reveal a mask. It was the visage of a porcelain doll, beautiful and haunting. She put a thin finger up to her plastic lips, and then the video ended.


Raven was shaking, and I was so shocked that I couldnt speak. We needed to tell someone. I was about to get up and try to contact the police, but an email came in right as I was going to stand. Without touching the computer, the email opened. Large red text flashed across the screen, *Keep quiet, or end up like this one. Youve already had one follower lost. Followers of Lilith, renounce or be redeemed.* 


What the *fuck?* I could hardly understand, but this was my fault. These fanatics thought that my friends were *followers.* Why was this happening? Eve had been right, I shouldnt have told my roommates anything, I should have left when I started being followed. My guilty thoughts were interrupted by the flashing screen in front of me. The email went white, and before my eyes I saw the page retreat to the inbox. Every message disappeared from the inbox at a rapid speed, the browser closed and the screen went black after flickering for a few minutes. 


I tried to see if it would turn back on, but it was useless. The computer made a sputtering noise when I hit the power button, and a small puff of smoke came from the side where the fan ejected air.I turned the computer over to try and give it air to cool off, but parts of the plastic melted before my very eyes. I reached out to see if I could remove the battery, but the computer was painfully hot to the touch. Whoever had sent the message had done something to cover their tracks. 


Suddenly it hit me what the message had said. Maya. Had they already taken her? I called her phone, hoping against everything that I was wrong. She answered, to my surprise, but my sigh of relief caught in my throat.


Dont contact me again, you disgust me. You killed my friend. 


Maya? Its me, Lily-- I started to tell her, but she cut me off. 


Lilith, She corrected, Leave me alone. I saw what you did to Allison. 


She hung up on me. I didnt understand why she was so pissed at me, but I was still at least relieved that she was okay. I could understand why she blamed me. I wanted Raven to leave too, but she refused. I felt guilty for her staying, but I had nowhere else to go at the time and she wasn't budging. Raven and I spent the next several days trying to read up on demons, it wasnt really eye opening. 


Nothing substantial turned up, and Maya still wouldnt come home. She talked to Raven occasionally, but eventually told her that she didnt want to associate with a follower of Lilith. I couldnt understand how my entire life had flipped around, it had only been a little over two weeks since I found the journal. Between attending classes I read about demons, and tried to contact Midnight again. The number didnt show up on the card again, and the number in my call log gave me a message about it being disconnected. 


I spent a lot of time looking at the last journal entry, but it also provided no help. There was one line, *Fear not, Im coming to save you.* I had no idea how my sister would manage to find me, and what would happen once she did, but it was almost a reassuring message. The days faded into a relative sense of normal. Raven and I were alone in the apartment, Maya hated us, and the car that had been following me before it took Allison had returned. 


The relative peace that had fallen over us for nearly a week was shattered the day Maya came back home. I walked into the apartment after class one day, and everything was silent. It scared me, because Raven was always home before me. The calm of the past week had set me on edge, after Allisons murder, the threats against us, and our minimal luck finding solid evidence against whoever was doing this, calm was the most irrational thing we experienced. 


There was no going to the police unless we wanted to end up like Allison, and there was no explaining to them that I was some sort of demonic heir and everyone around me was in danger. I spent part of the week urging Raven to leave, to go back home to her parents and forget about me, but she wanted to ride this out with me. I wish so much that she had listened and left. I wish I knew somewhere I could have run off to, but my parents house was full of people doing repairs. There was nowhere I could go without dragging more people into this mess. 


I called out Ravens name into the silent apartment, and was met with a muffled thudding noise. I hurried into the room that still contained all of Mayas things, it was where the sound had come from. There she was. Maya was splattered with blood, it dripped from the front of her body, pooling on top of the body beneath her. She sat straddling the corpse, holding the body down as she repeatedly brought down the bloody kitchen knife. She must have gone absolutely insane, Raven was already dead. 


She laid there lifeless as the blade punctured her chest over and over. I lost it. With a sound of rage I didnt know I could produce, I lunged across the room, taking Maya to the floor. She tried to guide the knife into my stomach, but somehow I managed to wrench it from her hand. I held her down with all of my weight, hesitating with the knife over her throat. She laughed then, the blood splatter on her face making the hysterical sound seem even more menacing. 


What did you do?! She was your friend! 


She laughed again at my statement, the sound becoming raspy from the force she used to produce it, You look as you should! She giggled, leaning forward so that the knife pressed slightly into her throat, Im no friend to the followers of Lilith. 


Her hand abruptly shot out from where it was pinned, and she pulled the knife into her. I scrambled away as the blood came forth, and she laughed until the sound died with her body. I was enraged, shocked, and covered in the intermingled blood of my two closest friends. I walked to the bathroom in shock, knowing that there was nothing I could do. Calling the police would only cause worse problems, my fingerprints were on the weapon that killed my friends. I was covered in their blood. I had to leave, I had to go anywhere but here. 


Allison had been gone for over a week, her family was bound to notice her lack of contact and send someone looking. Someone was going to find that somehow, I was the only person alive left living here. I looked in the mirror, prepared to wash the blood off and was taken aback. I saw the darkness receding from my eyes, and I knew for sure at that moment that Midnight had been right about my less than human biology. I understood why Maya had said that I looked as I should. 


I rinsed the blood off, ran to my room, changed clothes, and packed a quick bag. I had no idea where I was going, but I was leaving as soon as possible. I opened the front door to leave and was met with a face that I only knew from memories. 


Hey there, Lilith, Eve smiled at me as though her presence was to be expected.


I embraced her, and revealed my panic over everything that was happening. 


I know, I know, Im here to help. Lets go, She walked out the door with purpose, and I followed behind, sinking into the role of obedient little sister with ease. 


She hopped in the driver's seat of a car, and beckoned for me to get in as well. Once in the vehicle I turned to her again. 


What about the people who have been watching me? How did you get here? Where have you *been*? I listed off the first of many questions that were flooding to the surface. 


Theyre gone, not sure where. I dealt with it, not important, She spoke as she pulled out of the parking lot, I actually was in a psychiatric institution for about three years, when I was 18 I was able to leave of my own accord. The ones possessing our parents didnt have the right to leave me in there, and I stopped talking about the visions. They figured I was sane enough. Since then Ive been around, She shrugged as though it wasnt important, Ive seen this happen already, I knew where you were. 


Why didnt you come sooner? Why didnt you stop my friends from getting hurt? I yelled at her. 


She had been free and roaming for *years*, and she waited until *now*to help me? 


She shrugged again, Youre my only concern. I put the journal in the house back when I set up the fire. They were getting to close to finding me, and I needed you to be ready to trust me. 


Why wouldnt I trust you? I asked, trying to wrap my head around all the information I was receiving at once. Eve started the fire. 


She shrugged yet again, staring intently at road signs as she drove, I was beginning to get extremely annoyed by her attitude towards everything. 


Its just the way things were set out to be, Im sorry about your friends, She placed a hand over mine reassuringly, still staring at the signs.


Abruptly she turned a corner and released my hand. 


Why now? I dont understand.


Youre going to awaken soon, signs should be showing, and the blocks placed on your memory werent weak enough to break until recently, She said it as though it was the most obvious thing in the world, and I supposed that knowing all these secrets for her entire life gave her reason to act so.


Midnight? I said hesitantly, not knowing what question to ask now. 


Ah him, quite a fan of you. Hes been helpful, She didn't seem pleased while talking about him.


Eve, I honestly dont understand most of whats going on. Can you just explain?


When we arrive. 


She stayed relatively silent for the rest of the ride, only answering simple questions. After over two hours of driving we pulled up to a decrepit building in a city I didnt recognize. 


Whats this? 


Abandoned, She stated simply, walking confidently towards the back door, This is where were staying, dont have to worry about anyone finding us. 


The interior of the building was cold and musty, dust sat in a thick layer over everything. 


Ready? She asked as we entered a room containing sleeping bags, a camp stove, and several backpacks of supplies. I nodded, unsure of what I was agreeing to.


You already know what Midnight told you, Im Eve, you're Lilith. Reincarnations and such. Youre going to awaken, meaning youll have all the power of the highest ranking demons, okay? 


I nodded, Id come to terms with this while reading about demons, but it wasnt exactly information I could put to good use. 


Youve got some. Power, that is-- She paused as she opened the backpacks, searching for something, Totally useless right now, far as I know. Youll have more if you awaken. Basically, youll probably cause the apocalypse when that happens, but youll be a ruler. Im pretty much your opposite, they think I make you weak. Not sure on that, havent actually seen past when I found you. 


You stopped having visions? I asked. 


Mhmm, seems so. The last one I had was of your friends dying, that was months ago. 


Oh.. I had no idea how I was supposed to respond to that. You know who has been following me? 


Oh them, yea. Theyre a group of people that consider themselves the saviors to humanity, they want to kill you and anyone who might be on your side. Demon hunters, I suppose, She pulled out some packages and started the stove, sitting down in front of it. 


You killed the demons that took our parents bodies? 


Kinda, not really. I released them, may those bodies rest in piece. Not that easy to kill a demon. 


Why did they take you away?


Supposedly youd be stronger without ever having me meddle in your life. They couldnt kill me, because our lives were tied for 18 years, She shrugged. 


Will you stop doing that! This is still relatively new to me and youre acting like its nothing. 


She sighed, It really is nothing, She dropped some spices that I didnt recognize into the pot on the stove, Until you turned 18, we were tied. You died, I died. They didnt want one side to have all the power if they got to one of us. 


Oh.. I was speechless yet again, and I sat down on one of the sleeping bags so I could sort through this information. Eve She looked up from the boiling pot, Why did they wait so long to come after me?


Once we were untied, there was one more boundary set in play, to keep the sides even. She took the pot off the stove and stood, We can only truly end eachother, Guilt filled her voice, Youre hard to hurt, you arent natural. One born as a miracle, one born of a deal. 


So we'll never die?


She didn't respond right away, she seemed lost in thought, Our parents were so greedy. They couldn't accept what the heavens gave them and had to bargain for more, Her sudden mood shift scared me. 


She looked so *angry*, and she gripped the pot handles so tightly that her knuckles turned white. I wanted to stand, I wanted to go to her side and offer reassuring words, but none came to mind. 


Eve-- My words were cut off by my own scream, searing hot liquid covered my face and upper body. 


I stared at my arms, steam and smoke were coming from my skin at an alarming speed. It was the most excruciating pain I had ever experienced, and I saw that the liquid was eating away at my flesh. I stood, absolutely enraged. My anger made the pain fade away. 


I have to do this! It's my job, I can't let you hurt anyone else! She screamed, brandishing a knife I hadn't noticed before. 


I don't know what came over me, but I lunged at her. Pure rage flowed through the entirety of my being, only enhanced as I wrapped my hands around her throat. 


She struggled to speak, You will bring the End. 


She barely choked out the words as I tightened my grip. I couldn't let her kill me. She stabbed at me weakly, I barely felt the knife enter my body. I felt as the life left her body, not as a loss but as a rush. It was a thrilling feeling of power, and I could sense that it was okay to let her body fall to the floor. 


The first day I reunited with my sister I killed her. I felt her power come into me, and I think it may have sped along the process of me becoming stronger. I suppose I was already stronger than she had expected. She let me lose *everything* because she expected that I would bring the End. 


Maybe I will, if I'm mad enough. For now though, I'm just searching for more of my kind. Followers to lead. It's time I took my place, and show them all that I'm not the weak little girl who was led into a trap with a journal. 


My sister existed before I found that journal, and it's the reason that she doesn't exist now.

<TITLE> My Beautiful Roses </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-24 18:29:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 

As a child I lived in Turkey. Since growing up and moving to the United States I have realized that many people know nothing of the country. It was not the best of places, nor the worst of places, but that isn't important. The one spectacular part about that country was that it is pretty much the only place in the world where you can find black roses. 


I adored the flower, I found them so deeply beautiful. It wasn't long before I decided to grow them around my own home. I lived alone with my father, and the first time that the flowers bloomed outside our home he was unhappy. He thought they were hideous. I ignored his displeasure, these flowers were the one thing in the world that brought me joy. 


My father was a cruel man, he was not good at raising a daughter on his own. I did the housework exclusively, and I made all the meals. He told me that it was my place. He let me tend to my flowers as long as I was obedient. I did my best to do everything correctly, but more often than not I faced severe punishment over miniscule errors. There were many times when I was punished for nothing at all. 


My father bore a hatred for the world that I never knew the source of, and as I grew older I realized that he also bore a hatred for women. He took those hatreds out on me, I became both servant and wife. I was entirely miserable, but so very afraid. My only solace was tending to my roses. They were the last beautiful thing in my life at that point. 


One day when I neared the age of 15 I met a strange woman on my trip to get food for our dinner. She looked like a gypsy, and she fell in step with me as I walked. 


Child, I know you have been hurt, She looked me over from head to toe, Hurt quite deeply.


I nodded. 


Your roses can help you, and this, She held out a bundle of strange looking flowers, Witch hazel. 


I took the bundle hesitantly, What for?


A few of these, and one rose under the bed, each night. Save yourself, She abruptly turned and walked away. 


I didn't understand, but decided to try it just to see what would happen. That night after father was done with me and had fallen asleep, I snuck into his room and placed the plants under his bed. I did so every day for a week. Each morning he complained of being sicker, and he seemed to grow too weak to bother punishing me. 


On the seventh day he didn't arise from his bed. I found him in a puddle of his own blood, it had seemingly spewed from every orifice. My pain was over. I've made sure to always grow black roses since then. They truly are the most amazing flower.

<TITLE> We Learn From Experience </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-24 13:05:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've always had an insatiable desire to write. I longed to weave tales that would unsettle, chill, and terrify. When I first began, I felt a lack of creativity. I had so many *ideas* and no idea how to execute them. 


I didn't know how to describe the way a river of blood could erupt from a wound. I had no idea how to tell someone what the taste of flesh is like, how it might feel to pull meat from the bones of another human. How could I display the fear a victim feels when they are being hunted at night by a stranger, and the emotion that rushes through the stranger when he watches the life fade from the eyes of his prey? 


There are so many details that go into creating something that truly makes a reader feel afraid, repulsed, or even happy. Some of us take sick pleasure in reading about the gruesome end of other people. We judge a piece of work by how well the writer displayed the emotions and actions of the characters. How could anyone just *think* of such things? They're awful, surely no one could simply imagine such horrifying and grotesque scenarios. 


That's what this place is for. The one place in the world where you read about these victims witnessing and experiencing the most horrifying things, and where sinister folks tell the tales of the prey they hunt. I never meant to become the type of person who could post here, my intention was to seek inspiration. All I needed was experience so that I could surpass my writer's block and accurately describe any scenario. I did so by getting involved in said scenarios. 


I visited hospitals, stood by as I watched families grieve over the death of a loved one. I watched as broken and bloodied citizens were rushed into the emergency room. There was blood, bone, despair, and the sense of urgency was nearly palpable. Being there gave me some sort of idea of how I could portray the physical pain of being dangerously hurt, and the emotional toll of death on a loved one. 


It was a great first step, it helped me figure out how to begin writing my book. I came to a point not long after where I realized that I didn't have enough information. I couldn't put any more words towards the book. My limited knowledge was expended and I was faced with another block. I needed to seek out another angle of research. I needed to witness a death, preferable a violent murder. I know it sounds wrong to seek out such a thing, but how else could I create an accurate account for my book? 


I roamed the dark streets at night, walking through the most violent part of the city. I saw aggression, violent fights, and the shadiest of interactions. I had yet to a death. One of those nights I was driving around looking for a place to stop and wander, as I pulled up to the side of the road I saw a girl around my age run out of an alley. A tall man was yelling and following her, she was in tears as she ran in front of my car. She was lucky I was already stopping. 


I beckoned out my window to her, Need a ride?


Apparently the man following her was not keen on the idea, he picked up his pace and began telling louder, his words intermingled with enough curse words to make the foulest mouth feel envy. The girl quickly ran to the passenger side of my car and scrambled in. 


Thank you so much Miss, please, please just drive, She pleaded as soon as the door was shut. 


The man began running towards the car, and I sped away. She told me where she lived, and I asked if the man would show up at her house. She sheepishly admitted that he was only a one night stand that got aggressive when she tried to leave. He shouldn't know where she lived. We made small talk as we drove-- about the college she was attending, and other meaningless things. 


We pulled into a parking lot behind her building, and I asked if she wanted to be escorted upstairs. She declined the offer, but I got out of the car anyways to light a cigarette. Her keys fell under the car as she hopped out, and I went to assist her with the light from my phone. She leaned down next to the open car door, groping the ground for her keys. On an impulse I quickly slammed the door shut, her head between it and the car. There was a sickening crunch, and her body crumpled as I released the door so that it fell open. 


I glanced around the lot, not seeing anyone. I quickly leaned over her body and pulled out the small pocket knife I kept for protection-- a lady can never be too prepared-- from the glove box. I crouched next to her body, checking for a pulse. None to be found, the force I'd used on the door seemed to have snapped her neck. I was pleased with the ease of the action, my next task was a little harder. I used the knife to carve out a steak sized chunk from her thigh, placing the meat in a ziploc bag from my purse. 


I closed the passenger door, got in the driver's seat and drove away. I was thrilled, I had so much new information to write about. I could feel my creativity flowing already. My next course of action would be the cook the meat and taste it, I had to learn the flavor and texture. Once I had done that I could write, and plan out what type of information I'd need to learn from my next victim. It was a beautiful start to my ability to write as well as I do now. 


You may think this is extreme, but honestly think about it. You read a lot of awful things, right? Could you pop accurate descriptions of those awful things off the top of your head? Of course not! It's not an odd thing to do at all. 


Sometimes writers need to learn from experience.

<TITLE> The Good Shade Hotel </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-23 06:46:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was out of work and looking for something to pay the rent until I could find a new job that was in my field, when I saw the add. I'd been scrolling through job listings when it caught my eye, *Several positions open at The Good Shade Hotel. $40+ per hour.* Well damn, that was way more than decent pay to work in a hotel. I was shocked that they'd even have open positions if they're paying that much, but it seemed to be my lucky day. I mean sure I lived in a huge city, but it was odd that I'd never heard of the place when it obviously was making a lot of money. 


I figured it must be extremely classy and high maintenance, and I was prepared to put up with some rich jerks if it meant a sweet paycheck. There was no address or phone number, just an email. I shot out a reply containing my resume, and kept looking through the other offers on the site. Before I found anything else that might be worth applying for, my inbox pinged. The people at the Good Shade were quick in their response. 


*Dear Mr. Stephens,* 


*It has come to our attention that you would like to apply for a position at The Good Shade Hotel. Your resume has been taken into account, and we require you to answer several follow-up questions so that you may be considered for the job.* 


Then came a series of questions, some were normal and others were extremely odd. I thought maybe they were trying to rule out anyone who might be crazy. No one wants psychotic hotel staff after all, right? 


*Have you had prior experience working in customer service and/or hospitality?* 


Yes, both. Prior experience in a small motel. 

*Would you be comfortable filling out an NDA form?* 


Yes. 


*Would you be comfortable working in a remote location?* 


Yes. 


*Are you willing/able to drive a long distance to attend work?*


Yes. 


*Are you willing/able to work night shifts?* 


Yes. 


*Which type(s) of position(s) are you looking for?* 


Any available, preferably not housekeeping, but willing if need be. 


*Have you had any issues with mental illness?* 


No. 


*Do you take any medications? If yes, please list.* 


No. 


*Do you believe in paranormal/supernatural/extraterrestrial beings?*


Not really, there's no proof of them. Unsure of my beliefs in the afterlife. 


*How many people live in your household?*


Only myself. 


*What is your marital/relationship status?* 


Single, never married. 


*Have you ever heard of our hotel?* 


Only in the job listing I responded to. 


*Do you contain 100% human genetics?* 


As far as I know, yes. 


*What caused you to apply for work here?* 


I am unemployed, have experience in this type of work, and could honestly use the money. 


*Please list any questions or concerns below your responses, we will respond to your application promptly. An affirmative response to your application will come with an email containing the details of your job placement, and a few documents requiring signature. Thank you for applying at The Good Shade Hotel.*


*- A. Smith, Owner   Manager.*


Like I said, some super odd questions. I wasn't about to turn it down though, I needed the money. I didn't think much of the odd questions anyways, the only logical explanation was that they had a bad experience with a psycho employee or two. If I was paying that much to employ someone, you're damn sure I'd want to make sure they didn't think they were E.T. I answered every question as truthfully as possible and sent the email back, confident that I'd be getting the job. 


My confidence was not misplaced, I received the affirmative response within the hour. I was overjoyed, this job paid so well that I'd never want to look for a different one. The new email gave me an address that I was to be at at exactly 4pm the next day. I would be working as a receptionist-- 40$ an hour to answer phones, put reservations into computers, and give out room keys-- it would be simple. Maybe not the most stimulating work, but tolerable. 


The drive out to the address I was given was odd. I passed through a tunnel I had been through a few times before, but I could swear that I didn't recognize the area I was in after coming out of the tunnel. I pushed my confusion aside, figuring that the landscape had changed since my last time in the area. I arrived at the address after over an hour of driving, it was remote and surrounded by forest. 


The building itself was grand. 15 stories high, beautiful architecture. The trees surrounding the hotel were probably the tallest I'd ever seen in my life, they seemed to scrape the sky. Somehow the hotel managed to look perfectly normal amidst the beautiful natural environment that stretched far into the distance. It was the only building for miles around, and it was well hidden. It occurred to me that the guests likely paid very well for this sort of seclusion, it was deeply peaceful. 


When I entered the building I found it to be dark and elegant. The place was so classy that the paycheck suddenly seemed reasonable. It wasn't the biggest hotel, but it was probably the fanciest one I'd set foot inside in my entire life. The lobby seemed cavernous, and my steps seemed to echo as I walked up to the front desk. 


Behind the desk stood a pretty redhead, she smiled as I came forward. 


How can I help you, sir? She asked politely in a sweet sing-song voice. 


Oh, uh.. I'm here for the receptionist position, I shook myself mentally, I had been staring. 


She giggled at my flustered state, I'll let Mister Smith know you've arrived. 


I resumed my staring as she walked away, there was something different about that girl. She returned with a tall man in tow. We shook hands and introduced ourselves, but I found myself distracted by the smiling redhead. Mister Smith seemed to notice my waning attention, he led me behind the desk and into an office. 


Quite the nuisance that Alphaea is, He chuckled fondly. 


Alphaea? I questioned, the unusual name felt odd on my tongue. 


Ah yes, I believe she is calling herself Alice now. Kind creature, when she wants to be. She's here from time to time to help out, you shouldn't experience any negative side effects, He replied, seemingly lost in thought. 


I had no idea what he meant, but I assumed he meant the immediate attraction I felt for her. She must have a history of fellow employees lusting after her. 


Ready for your entry meeting? He asked abruptly, apparently back on track. 


I nodded, and the meeting that followed left me confused and-- to be entirely honest-- a little freaked out. He went over the questions from my application, we discussed them in slightly more detail, and he provided more information about the job and its requirements. I had to sign a form before we even began talking about the position. Fortunately, a loophole Ive found in the contracts does not disallow me from posting my entire experience in a place that most of the world thinks is for fictional tales. I know that this place holds the truth, you know it too. This is the one place where I can freely talk about my experience, and Im so thankful to be able to get it all off of my chest.


Anyways, the rest of the meeting brought to light some of the reasons why I may not be allowed to speak of the job or the guests, but it initially made me wonder if perhaps my boss was insane. 


100% human genetics? He questioned as he looked over my application, Very good, the guests have been missing having someone of your appeal. 


Then he began listing the details of the position. I would mainly be working at the front desk, there may be occasional instances when I am requested by a guest to deliver items to their room. They may also request too *look* at me for a maximum of 5 minutes, with zero physical contact. I am to avoid any physical contact-- including accidentally brushing against the clients. The contract requires three months minimum attendance before I may opt out, and opting out comes with what he called a mandatory deconditioning. Opportunities to opt out and be debriefed are provided at three month intervals, attempting to quit before one of the intervals breaks the rules of the contract. 


He listed off the consequences of breaking the contract at such a speed that I barely understood them, and followed up by saying, I think youll do wonderfully here, Mr. Stephens. 


I was kind of dazed from all the information, but signed the contract. My boss might be a little crazy, and the requirements might be slightly odd, but the money wasnt something I could pass up. How bad could it be? 


My first shift was that very evening, I'd be working the desk alongside Alice. Mister Smith came up to the desk as I adjusted the nametag he had given me, *Tyler Stephens, H.S*. 


Alph-- Alice, He sighed, Be nice to this young man, it's hard to find people like him. 


She pouted for a moment, then nodded. Smith shifted his gaze to me and held out his hand. It contained a small vial of milky liquid. 


If you start to become delusional, a drop in each eye, He turned and walked away. 


I looked to Alice in confusion, It's in your contract, She said, That'll kill any negative side effects if you happen to touch the wrong guest, or spend too much time with me.


She gave a wide smile, and for a moment her teeth looked unnaturally sharp. I slipped the vial into my pocket, feeling incredibly skeptical about the entire job. It was too late to back out though, I had already signed the contract. The beginning of the shift was slow, no guests had come to check in or out. I found myself staring at Alice again, her nametag caught my eye. *Alphaea, I.C.* 


No last name? I asked. 


She glanced at her nametag, Don't have one, at least not one that would fit or make sense on a nametag, She shrugged. 


And the letters? H.S, I.C? 


*Homo Sapien, Illecebrsa Cur.* Scientific name in your case, the Shades decided mine, She said nonchalantly, typing something into the computer. 


*Illecebrsa Cur*? Shades? What? I laughed, thinking it was some kind of joke on the newbie. 


Charming Mutt, She said dryly, Their sense of humor is immaculate. It doesn't pay to be one of a kind. 


I stared for a moment, looking for a hint that she was joking. Her face remained completely serious. 


Oh I responded, not sure what to say. 


She started laughing at of nowhere, and I was relieved for a moment. 


You really have no idea what youve gotten yourself into, huh? 


Im a really overpaid receptionist, and Im the victim of the weirdest hazing ever? I said with a nervous laugh. 


She giggled again, I could tell you, but I think itd be more fun to watch you gradually realize what youre part of, She paused, looking around the empty lobby, Ill tell you this though. The name has a reason, all of our guests are Shades of some sort. Im one as well, in fact youll probably be the only person roaming around wearing an *H.S* for the entirety of your employment. 


I have no idea what a Shade is, I told her. 


Her response was a wide smile, revealing rows of shark-like teeth. I took a step back, letting out another nervous laugh. I was afraid. 


They're real, wanna touch? She asked, the amusement on her face was plain to see. 


I shook my head no, unable to respond. She shrugged and turned back to the computer. I wasn't sure what to think, but I was now wholeheartedly aware that this girl was *not* human. The room fell silent, I had no idea how to start a conversation after seeing that. 


Alice's voice broke the tension, Sylvia should be here in exactly two minutes. 


I nodded, still not trusting myself to say something that wouldn't have me eaten by those teeth. She was right though, I watched the clock on the far wall tick the time away. Exactly 120 ticks later the front door opened. 


A girl who had to be no older than 12 entered. She was a horrifying mess. Covered in dirt and blood, her left arm was bent at an unnatural angle and a bone was protruding grotesquely from her forearm. She dragged her right leg behind her, the ankle quite obviously broken, and a deep gash in her forehead was pouring blood. My first instinct was to scream, and my second was to run to help. 


Alice yelled for me to stop, but I ignored her. I ran to the young girl.


Ohmygod, are you okay? Do you need me to call you an ambulance? What happened? The words erupted from my mouth, hardly a space for breath between them. 


She stared blankly into the distance, not acknowledging my panicked questions, I reached out for her and Alice yelled from near the desk, *STOP!*


Too late. I gripped the girl's shoulders and stared at her. Her eyes were glazed over with a milky white, and she let out a piercing scream when my hands made contact. Before I could blink she was gone. My hands were grasping at empty air. She had simply and entirely disappeared from the lobby. 


You moron! Alice yelled at me again. 


I started at her, nowhere near understanding what had just occurred. 


She sighed as she saw my face, Now she's going to loop. She'll be back in an hour. 


What? 


You're not supposed to touch the guests, She stated, sounding annoyed. 


We need to call the police, she was seriously hurt! I was freaking out. 


She was seriously dead, She said dryly, The phones here don't make calls to 911 anyways. She's a Shade. Stop panicking. You'll get used to it.


I couldn't think of any response to that. I still hadn't fully grasped what this job was all about. I suddenly realized that I had no feeling in my hands, I clutched them close to my chest to discover that they were cold as ice. Instantly the feeling spread, deep into my chest and up my arms. I was freezing, and began shivering violently as I walked back to the desk. 


Alice glanced at me when I arrived beside her, and let out another exasperated sigh. 


Give me the vial, tip your head back, She ordered. 


I pulled it out from my pocket while she took an eye dropper from a drawer in the desk. I watched as she squeezed the end of the dropper to pull liquid from the vile. The milky substance turned a pale purple as it entered the dropper. I leaned my head back and allowed her to put a drop in each of my eyes. As she tucked the vial back into my pocket and put away the dropper I felt the cold leave my body. 


When Sylvia gets back I'll deal with her, She said calmly, Maybe you should just watch for the first couple of days. There's a lot to learn about the different types of Shades that we room. 


I nodded, and sat patiently. I looked over the fine print in my contract while we waited, *Early dismissal from any staff position will result in an extremely painful deconditioning process. It is highly recommended to wait the entire three month period so that we may provide a nearly painless process.* Based on what I had already seen tonight, I didn't want to know what these people considered a painful process. I'd stick out the job for three months, and quit if I couldn't handle the insanity. 


Soon enough Sylvia came back. She looked exactly the same as she had an hour ago. I resisted the urge to both scream and vomit. Alice called out to her. 


Hi Sylvia, sweetie! She walked over and knelt in front of the mangled girl, Welcome back to the Good Shade, I'm sorry to tell you again, but you're dead. 


Sylvia's head snapped toward Alice at an inhuman speed. She nodded, seeming to think for a moment. 


We have room U344 available for you, Alice told her, holding out a key card. 


The girl nodded again, took the key, and shuffled her way towards the elevator. When the doors shut behind her I let out the breath I hadn't realized I was holding. Alice walked back over and sat at the desk. 


There's no one else scheduled for tonight, you could probably nap until the shift ends.


Yea, I might I started, then curiosity got the best of me, U344? 


Oh, Mister Smith forgot to tell you? Well, we have 50 floors of underground rooms, She told me, A lot of the guests prefer it.


I don't know why it surprised me, after everything else that had happened. I was sitting next to a girl with shark teeth, and we had just let a mangled corpse into the hotel. What else? 


I don't know how I'm going to manage the next three months without having nightmares, I laughed, but the statement was entirely serious. 


Oh honey, Alice giggled, You'll see much worse, trust me. 


I stared at her sharp teeth and felt a chill run through me. She wasn't wrong about that.

<TEXT> Drag me into the darkest depths, 

Take me, suffocate me

Gasping, clawing, reaching for breath 

Life shattered, please replace me

-//-

Sing the song of my demise

The soundtrack of each piercing slice 

Watch my body crash to the floor

Take me under

My life is yours 

-//-

Hear the call of death itself

The screeching in this silent house 

The scratching, creaking, whispery noise 

The cries of those without a voice 

-//-

Take me away from my pain

Tip the king of my chess game 

The pounding heartbeat finally stops

No more time left on this clock

-//- 

Rushing, racing, 

End awaiting 

Life ticks by

I fall, complacent 

Death looks up to me 

From the pavement

<TEXT> Well as far as we knew at that point, we had no solid proof that she was really missing. She's prone to taking off with boys, so the rational solution was to wait until at least morning if she didn't contact us. That way we would have reason to be concerned, because then it wouldn't be so close to her normal behavior. 

Even if one of the other girls called right away, it would look bad on us if the police came to the apartment and realized I was the girl who had already called in "false" reports twice. Especially about a person who bailed on us relatively often when she ran into someone. We didn't want them to not look for her thinking that we were trying to prank them "again". 

And also to be honest, it was partially because none of us knew if you could report someone missing with no solid information, and so soon after you couldn't locate them. According to the information I've found for our state, we weren't entirely wrong about waiting. You usually need sufficient reason to report an adult missing, and depending on department policy you are supposed to wait 24 - 48 hours. 

So if the department near us enforced that policy for non-vulnerable people, we'd still be out of luck. The chances of us getting turned away until she had been gone for an amount of time that was unusual were very high. 

Also it's been nearly two weeks since she went missing, I'm not reporting my experiences directly as they happen. Far too late now to worry about her.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Sister Didn't Exist Until I Found Her Journal (Part Two) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-21 14:18:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If you missed the beginning of my fall into the rabbit hole that my life has become, it can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5zys6i/my_sister_didnt_exist_until_i_found_her_journal/).


I apologize in advance for how slow my updates come along, honestly things have been absolutely crazy for me. I can hardly keep track of the days, I've only had the journal for a few weeks. I know I said a few months ago was when the fire happened, but I wasn't expecting to be able to tell my story so soon. The fire happened early February, and I got into the house in the beginning of March. Just a small timeline for anyone confused, maybe you can keep track for yourself. Time means nothing at this point. Anyways, Ill continue catching up where I left off.


After a thoroughly exhausting discussion about finding the journal and what it could mean, we all went to our rooms. I was so tired that when I curled up in Raven's bed I fell asleep instantaneously. I woke up suddenly in the night, checking the clock showed the time as nearly 1am. I was about to tuck myself back into Raven and sleep again, but a glint of silver caught my eye. 


It was the card that Id left on the end table. I picked it up for a moment and looked it over, there was something that I hadnt seen before. On the back was a phone number. Yet another confusing thing to add to my day, because I was positive I hadnt seen the number earlier. I debated calling to see who on earth this guy may be, but a second glance at the clock ticking the minutes away towards morning made me decide to put it off until daylight. 


When morning arrived I chose to attend my classes for the day, I didnt want the weird things going on in my personal life to set me back. On my drive back to the apartment afterwards I could swear I saw the car that had followed me. It was parked a block down from my building, *so much for evading the stalker.* I nearly turned the car around and left, but I realized that there was no point. If the car was here then they already knew what building I lived in. I wished I hadnt asked Raven to drive it home for me, but I needed it to get to class. It had felt like there were eyes on me constantly throughout the day, and the feeling didnt subside when I arrived home.


It seemed that things were just going to become more strange and frightening for me no matter how I tried to avoid them. When I got inside I told the girls about the car that had followed me the day before, and Raven chimed in about seeing the Mister Midnight guy by my car after Id ditched it. We all came to the mutual agreement that this was insanely weird, and I suggested we call the number on the card. 


Maya looked at me in confusion, There is no number on the card. 


Yea there is, I noticed it last night. Hold on, Ill go grab it, I ran into my room and picked the card up off the table, but no matter how I looked at it Maya was right. There was no number on the card. 


I returned to the living room and let the girls know that I had probably dreamed there being a number, but on the inside I was *positive* that I had seen it. We discussed other options. We could follow the car that had been stalking me, run an extensive search for Mister Midnight online, or confront whoever was driving the strange car. When the third option was brought up it felt like a cold hand raked down my spine. *Bad idea.* I didnt know why the feeling was so strong, but I knew that we *definitely* should not approach the car without knowing who was in it. 


The other two options seemed simple enough. Well, the online research did. As for stalking my stalker, the only time I had seen the car was when it was following me, or sitting parked nearby. How were we supposed to follow a vehicle that was just following me around? Wed be going in circles. So for the time being, we didnt do anything ourselves about the tail. Nothing had come of it yet, and whoever it was already knew where I lived and likely knew where I went to school. There was nothing else that following me would reveal to the stalker. Though it was creepy, whoever it was hasnt actually *done* anything except follow and keep a distance. 


Probably not the best mindset, but there was a simple option to deal with the stalker. I called the police. Unfortunately that didn't pan out well. Whoever was in the car wasn't technically considered a stalker because they hadn't attempted to make any sort of contact with me, and I had literally zero proof of someone following me. I was told to inform them if the stranger made any repeated attempts of communication, threatened me, or I could provide proof. I made a mental note to write down the license plate and try to get pictures. Other than that the police were absolutely no help to me at that moment.


Over the next few days I kept to my mental notation, every time I saw the car I looked for the license plate number. To my dismay I discovered that I was either being followed by several cars of the same model, or the person following me changed license plates to avoid being tracked down so easily. I made note of at least four different license plates, and contacted the police department again with the information. Honestly the woman on the phone seemed exasperated with me, but I suppose I might seem a little paranoid being that I still hadnt been able to get a picture. 


Not for lack of trying though, every time I pulled out my phone to take a picture, the car sped off with a screech. I ended up with a series of pictures too blurry to be reasonable evidence, or no picture at all. It was frustrating to say the least, and Im sure it made me look insane. Apparently my pestering worked, because the woman asked me to hold while she ran the plates. After a few minutes she came back on the line sounding extremely annoyed.


Maam, it is not appropriate to waste valuable police time on false accusations. Please stop calling our department unless you have a serious matter and *actual* evidence to report, She said it as though she was about to end the call on me.


Wait no, I quickly chimed in before she could hang up, What was wrong with what I reported? 


She sighed heavily, The last time you called, you had no proof. Now your version of *proof* is license plate numbers from four different vehicles. All of which are registered to different people across the state. None of the vehicles are in any way the vehicle that you described to be following you. Next time you try to pull one over on the police, think up a more elaborate lie. One more false report from you, and you *will* be charged. Youre lucky that Im not having you charged right now. She abruptly hung up the phone, there was an audible *thunk* sound before the click of the connection being cut off.


That was not at all what I had been expecting. I didnt even think of how bad it might look for me by reporting so many license plates and claiming they were all from one vehicle. Clearly the stalker had thought well ahead of me. The police road was a dead end, unless I received an obviously traceable threat, or some really compelling proof, I was fucked. Calling them was no longer an option, Id probably have to be in imminent danger for them to believe me. I was incredibly discouraged. 


Our next resource was the web search for all things related to Mister Midnight. Unfortunately that was almost as much of a bust as contacting the police. The girls had only managed to find one site, and even that was nearly bare of information. They showed it to me when I arrived home, they had found a single web page. It was identical to the card I had received several days prior. I was annoyed and went to click out of the web page, when a flicker caught my eye. The script that read, *Well call you* had changed. The message now read, *With a name like Midnight, you ought to be aware of these things known as hints*. 


Well *shit*, if that didnt make it obvious enough. I instantly recalled seeing the number several nights prior, sometime between midnight and 1am. Im not normally one to believe in things that seem like magic, so I convinced myself that the business card functioned with some sort of time lapsed optical illusion. Which sounds equally as ridiculous as a magical business card, in my opinion. I wasnt sure if we should contact him right away, but the others convinced me, *tonight is as good as tomorrow, until tomorrow is too late.* Raven and her way with words. 


There were still several hours until midnight, so that gave me some time to look through the journal a bit more. It had been several days and I figured, as Raven had said, tonight is as good as tomorrow. Though when it came to the journal sooner was better than later. With all the discoveries that this book could and had already uncovered, it was probably my most important resource. I wasn't sure if reading more could bring up or cause anything worse because things were already so far from normal. The other girls started to cook dinner, so I slunk off to my room to do some reading.


I pulled up the journal and flipped to the next page.


*If you've come this far then you already know something is wrong, and by this point you're not alone. Unfortunately it's not the type of company that you're hoping for. You're not surrounded by life. It may be better for everyone around you if you left as soon as possible. I already know you won't though. There's nowhere for you to go, and I'm sorry that I brought all of this onto you.*


Then came the memory trigger. 


*I never wanted to leave, but when our parents got taken I had no choice. I had to go where they sent me.*


The memory hit hard and fast like all the others. Before the direct memory there came a broad revelation. I recalled that around the time I turned 11 not only did my parents change and become secluded, but they changed towards me and my sister. It was mostly Eve though. They started acting like she was some sort of evil that was living in their house. Over the next two years the tension rose, and the house felt like a coffin. It was suffocating to be at home, there was constant disapproval, constant beratement, and for Eve there wasn't a thing that she could do that was right. 


Our parents started pressuring me to let them know whenever Eve had made a claim about telling the future. In the past it had just been something silly that was pretty much ignored, or on certain occasions something that would make our mother strictly tell us, Do *not* run around saying such things, you are good little Christian girls, and you do *not* lie about that devil magic nonsense! 


We always joked about how mom was too serious about church when that happened, but we were passed the time of being reprimanded that way. Being a good little Christian girl no longer mattered at this point, we had stopped going to church and our mother had generally stopped preaching to us at home. The closest she came to her old ways was whenever we did something bad and she brought up the fact that wed to go to hell. That was never a threat in the past, but she became so fixated on it as we got older. 


The true memory that played behind my eyelids started late one night. Eve and I were in our room sleeping-- well not really sleeping, but pretending at least-- and when the house got quiet we assumed that our parents were asleep. That's when it would be safe to whisper. Eve started talking about how she had a prediction. She saw something but she didn't know what it was, it was like a darkness that came into the house. She told me that she'd been trying to tell me for the last two years, but she hadn't had a chance because of how much things had changed and how afraid she was. 


Apparently it was the same prediction that she had when I was only seven. She told me that she saw a darkness come into our house at night and enter into our parents bedroom, and it never came out. It never left at all. The next day the people who came out of that bedroom weren't really our parents. They had been taken-- or so she said. I found myself once again confused by what she was saying, *what did she mean our parents had been taken?* They were still right here with us. 


She saw my confusion and tried to clarify herself, The people in our house look like our parents, but only the bodies. Mom and Dad arent inside anymore, and--


Before she could finish her explanation our mother walked in the room. She walked over to my bed first, her footfalls sharp and quick. I was instantly terrified. She leaned over and pressed her hand into my face, gripping me by both cheeks, her nails digging in.


You were supposed to be asleep, and I know that you're talking about those ridiculous fantasies that Eve has been having again, She looked at me, her eyes appearing to have no whites or pupils. 


They were entirely black, and the terror that coursed through me intensified. I was not only scared due to the pain from her nails digging into my cheeks, but also the look of anger on her face which seemed absolutely inhuman. 


Lily, stop listening to your sister, she's crazy. This the last straw. I think it's time that she got some help, She let go of my face abruptly and my head fell back and hit the headboard with a loud thump. 


I was stunned, pain blooming from the blow as well as the crescents her nails had left in my cheeks. She walked over to Eve next, and I heard the whisper that wasn't meant for my ears. 


You already know too much, and if you could have just shut your mouth then maybe this wouldn't need to happen. I'm happy it ends this way. Tomorrow you're gone. I'm not dealing with you getting in the way of everything, She followed up her threat by smacking Eve across the face, the impact of the slap was hard enough to seemingly echo through our bedroom. 


When she left Eve only said one hushed statement to me, I told you that you'd forget, and I told you that you'd remember. I'll miss you, we should go to sleep now, She rolled over and buried herself in the blankets. I didn't reply, yet again I had no idea what to say.


The next morning Eve was shipped off to a psychiatric institute. The entire morning was tense-- to say the least. I hardly spoke for fear of what my mother might do to one of us if I said something out of line. People showed up at the door and took Eve to a car, she waved goodbye to me but I didn't wave back. I was distraught. I still didn't fully understand the situation, I almost believed that my parents were right about her being crazy. That didn't make sense though, what about the safe? What about all the other things that she had said to me in the past that had come true? Most important of all, what about what our mother had said last night about getting in the way? Why would they send her away with so little warning?


After Eve was gone my mother gave me an acid dipped smile, Don't be upset, we're going to see a good doctor today and you won't have to think about this ever again. 


Her grin widened, and once again I watched her eyes turn dark. I was afraid. My whole family was gone, my parents were not my parents, and my sister had been sent away for knowing the truth. I ran from the room and hid. I had no idea what they were going to do to me. Hiding was no use, when it was time to leave the *thing* pretending to be my mother fetched me with ease. I had been curled up under my bed, hoping they would ignore me, or at least be unable to find me long enough for me to sneak out of the house. She wrapped her hands around my ankles, digging her sharp claw-length nails into my skin again, and pulled me out with an incredible amount of force. 


My face scraped roughly against the carpet, and I vaguely wondered what this supposed doctor would think of my injuries. She clutched my wrist tightly enough that I thought the bones may crack, and pulled me out to the car. I spent the entire ride rubbing my sore wrist, and running my fingers lightly over the crescent shaped cuts that speckled my cheeks. Eventually we arrived in front of a small brown building, it kind of looked like a walk-in clinic. My parents took me inside and introduced me to a man that they called Doctor Midnight. He smiled at me as I sat down in his chair, and I noticed that his eyes were almost as dark as I had seen my mother's become.


The last part of the memory was him leaning in and whispering to me, *This could be temporary.*


When my vision cleared it took me a moment to gather myself. I paged through the rest of the book, but it was all blank except for one other page. The memory solidified the fact that we needed to call that number. It turns out that I *did* in fact know who Mister Midnight was, he was the reason that I couldn't remember anything about my sister before finding this journal. Maybe he knew more about what happened, but regardless of that contacting him was the most logical next step. I had to know why he had come looking for me, why he took my memories, and how *exactly* he knew that my memories would only be stolen temporarily.


I relayed my most recent memory to my roommates, and we waited until midnight. I pulled out the card after the clock ticked a few seconds past the hour. As if by Magic the glittery script appeared on the back before my very eyes. There was his phone number. I went to gather the girls so that we could all call him together, but Allison was nowhere to be found. I showed Maya and Raven the number that appeared on the card, then I asked if either of them knew where Allison had disappeared to. 


According to Maya, she had apparently gone outside almost an hour go to have a smoke. This put me into a panic, and I looked outside to see if my constant watcher was still sitting out there. For the first time in days there was no car sitting outside the building. My stomach sank. We rushed outside to see if she was anywhere to be found. No such luck. We all tried calling her phone, only to find it had been tossed beneath a bush. 


Upon closer examination I noticed that her lock screen was set to something unusual, it was a picture of text. Looking closely it read, *Stop trying to meddle. This one isnt coming back. She wont be the last.* I thought that maybe this would be worthy enough to go to the police with, but again I realized how ridiculous it would sound. They already considered me a liar, and this was an accusation that could get us all into some serious trouble. There were various reasons that wed have to wait to make a report. She had only been gone an hour, and sometimes people dropped their phones. 


Shes only 19, for all anyone knows she could have run away with a boy-- shes definitely the type, and it wouldnt be the first time. Hell, she even could have written the note herself as a prank. I was already unreliable in the eyes of the police, so Id have to wait until something more solid came up before we could ask for their help. My only worry was that if this whole situation continued the way it was going, theres no way that I could tell them the whole story. I would sound absolutely insane. 


For a moment I wondered if maybe I was, maybe my friends were just humoring me because my parents had died. I questioned Maya and Raven, but they seemed to be taking the entire situation seriously, memory stealing doctor, future seeing sister and all. We decided that our best option was to go through with the call. It was the only source we had that may give us answers, he could know who has been following me, he could know who took Allison. My only hope was that he was at least a neutral party in all of this, or else we could be digging an even deeper hole. 



Thats all Ive got time to post right now, sorry again for the delays. I hope to be able to finish the catch-up in my next post, and get to the current insanity Ive been dealing with.

<TEXT> Mixing acid with other chemicals is a normal part of the lesson plan, as far as we were taught. 

They are kept in a sort of cupboard type thing that can be locked, but it is opened during class so that students can take chemicals to work on reactions for the assignments. 

I'm fairly sure it's quite common to have acids accessible for the lessons, because we learned a lot about how to neutralize the acids in case of a spill, and how to dilute them.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Mr. Cooke's Last Chemistry Class </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-20 06:12:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Mr. Cooke was the best Chemistry teacher. He was known to be an asshole at times, but he was good at his job. He got along well with the other teachers, and with students he'd taught in the past. Most of the kids who didn't like him were the ones currently being taught by him. He didn't take shit, he didn't accept excuses and he didn't give you extra chances once you proved you were too lazy or too incompetent to understand the lessons. 


He never gave lessons twice. You listened the first time, took notes, and went to your notes or other students when you were confused. You could ask him a question, and he'd explain to you, but he also taught college students so he expected you to be able to figure things out. He was respected, and feared. Sometimes he had a temper. The level of fear everyone had for him was at an all time high on his last day teaching at our school. 


We were nearly halfway through the year, a time when everyone was both excited and worn out. Christmas break had come and passed, and most of the students had taken on that after-break mentality. Forgetting the things we learned in the first half of the year, slacking, not coming prepared to class, half-assing assignments because all we needed was to do the finals for the semester, and just general rowdy behavior. The Juniors were intolerable, and we went in to Chemistry that day overconfident and unprepared. 


The day was supposed to be simple, we were all finishing up projects and studying for the upcoming finals. Some students were mixing chemicals and recording the reactions, some were studying, some reading, some doing work for other classes, all of us were relatively on task, save for a few of the guys. They were dicking around in the lab portion of the classroom, mixing random things, running around the workstations, and pretending to throw chemicals at one another. Mr. Cooke had left the room a few minutes prior, and they had taken full advantage of the absence. 


As one of the students who was actually working, I got annoyed by the situation pretty quick. We were all going to get in shit when the teacher got back. There were some more bold students who were trying to work as well, ones who actually told the guys to stop fucking around before we got in trouble. They just laughed about it though. 


Sean, Blaine, and Logan. Best friends, cocky idiots. I can't believe that after teachers dealing with their antics for two and a half years that they'd still be assigned to the same class. Why would you assign three guys that are *always* doing reckless things to the *same* Chemistry class? It was beyond me. The three of them had already pulled several stunts in here that have lead to detentions and suspensions, and I had no doubt that Mr. Cooke would be absolutely pissed when he witnessed the latest one. I guess I was right. 


Someone left to get him, not wanting us all to get the lecture about standing by during a potentially dangerous situation. Mr. Cooke came thundering into the room, followed hastily by the girl who had retrieved him. He shut the door behind him, locking it into place, then walked across the room and locked the other door. The boys paid no heed to the teacher, and were still running around holding bottles of acid. Stupid. Maybe that was what set Mr. Cooke over the edge. 


He stood behind his desk silent, waiting for the class to realize. Most of us at the desks did, and we fell into a hush. Soon enough everyone else caught on, but the boys who had been messing around had only calmed slightly. They stood side by side in front of the lab area, knocking into each other and snickering. It was a definite improvement from their other moronic activities, but they were still bound to get in some trouble. *Some* being the understatement of the century. 


Williams, Kolovsky, Overbeek, He pronounced each syllable with enough force that he could have broken their names apart just by saying them, Get up here.


The boys walked over, their smug grins proving that they had no idea of the hell they had to pay. Mr. Cooke produced a large glass bowl, and placed it on top of the desk. He walked over to the lab area and collected a large glass bottle, then brought it over the desk and proceeded to fill the bowl halfway. 


Alright students, He began, What is the normal safety procedure for dealing with *any* chemicals? 


A girl near the front raised her hand and began listing the safety protocol we had learned in the beginning of the year. The teacher nodded as she spoke, but the boys behind him were snickering to each other and mocking the girl. 


So what you're saying is, running around carelessly with any sort of chemical is not safe or permitted? 


The girl hesitated, looking for a moment to the boys who were now mocking the teacher. Mr. Cooke abruptly pick up the bowl on his desk and tossed the contents at the students behind him. There was no sign, no warning. He had been so calm, and now suddenly the room was full of panicked students. We had gone from an attentive flock, to a field of scattered prey. Our shepherd had been a wolf in disguise. 


I sat stricken in my seat. People were screaming, rushing against the doors. I stared at Logan, who clutched his face in agony, the skin seemed to slowly be melting away. It became a grotesque mask over his face, blood and melting flesh mixing together to create a hideous visage. Blaine and Sean didn't fair much better. They had all been hit to some severe extent, faces, necks, chests and hands. They all look like monsters, and their agonized cries have haunted me since that day. 


I joined the others who were escaping the room, entering the hall in a state of fearful panic. Other teachers and students were rushing forward to find out what was going on, and the screaming-- oh god there was so much screaming. I can hardly stand to think about it all. Itll take a lot of counselling for a lot of people. I don't think I'll ever get the image of melted flesh out of my mind. 


The authorities were called, and Mr. Cooke was taken away in cuffs. They still haven't figured out what exactly broke inside him that day. One too many rowdy students, or careless actions, maybe it was the entire job itself, or maybe he was just crazy. The boys were taken to the hospital to get treated, but they all survived the horrific incident. 


School was closed for nearly a week, the Chemistry lab has been closed off. A new teacher was hired, and there are so many counselors available to talk to the students about the incident. It's only been a few weeks since then, but it feels more fresh than that. I don't even know what I'm supposed to take away from this sort of situation. There is just one thing that constantly runs through my mind. 


I never want to make a Chemistry teacher mad.

<TITLE> Listen to What Your Kids Say </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-19 02:33:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My son is a good kid. He's smart for his age, and he tries his hardest to be kind to other kids. Sometimes he makes a mistake, but like every other kid he has a reasoning for why he does it. He is always able to justify everything he does with the ever infallible kid logic. 


*Well that's what Mommy does when she's upset.* 


*It's okay that I called him an asshole Daddy, you say it about your work friends.* 


*I had to break the screen to let the people inside out, they were trapped.* 


*Well Rebbeca in my class brought a kitten to school in her backpack, so I'm allowed to bring our cat.* 


I mean, it makes sense to an extent, but their oversimplified view of the world can be problematic. Things aren't okay to do just because you saw someone else do them. But we're adults, we know this. 


That brings me to what happened a few days ago. I was parked outside the school, waiting for the teachers to escort the first graders outside. I was going to pick up my son and his friend Jeremy to have a nice afternoon of snacks and Lego at our house until Jeremy's parents came to pick him up. 


The kids came out of the building and my little Andrew ran to the car excitedly. Remy was following hesitantly behind, looking incredibly upset. 


Andy, why is your friend so upset? I asked as he came up to my window. 


He just membered that his Mommy made cookies yesterday and now he won't get any! He replied dramatically. 


Well, if he's going to be so upset maybe I should call his parents to come get him? 


No Daddy! I know what to do, He smiled and hustled towards his friend. 


Hey Remy! We have ice cream and cookies and a new Xbox! You can come play with us, it'd be more fun than going home right now. We'll even drive you home after! He started pulling his friend towards the car, but I got out of the vehicle. 


Hold on boys, I need to talk to Andy for a second, I pulled my son aside, Hey, you can't lie to your friend just to get him to come over. He's going to he upset that we don't have those things, okay?


But it's what Uncle Tim does when we find friends to play with me at his house, He replied while giving me a skeptical look. 


What friends? 


Me and Uncle Tim go to the park and bring home friends to play. He brings them home after he brings me home. So it's okay.


That was the day that I found out my brother-in-law had kidnapped and murdered over thirty children, using my son as bait. Andrew thought his park friends always went home, but who knows what happened before they were killed. 


Sometimes you really need to pay attention to the reasons your kid says or does certain things.

<TITLE> My Sister Didn't Exist Until I Found Her Journal </TITLE>

<TEXT> **This post has been updated, if you already saw the beginning of my experiences, please start reading at the "Update"**


I always considered my life to be painfully average, maybe slightly below average even. I was an only child, well adjusted, not the greatest parent-child relationship, but everyone has their demons. I did well in school, not super popular but not entirely resolute, the whole nine yards of regularity. At least, I thought that until I was 19. Ever since that day just a few months ago I've been searching for answers. I've received a lot of them, but only the type that make you question things even more. 


That day would be the one when my family home burned down, and secrets arose like the plume of smoke I pictured had consumed my childhood. I was off at school, living in an apartment with some roommates at the time, a few hours from the town that I was raised in. I was headed to class when I received the call. There was a fire, two bodies were found inside the house. I knew as soon as I heard the word bodies that my parents were dead. For some reason I couldn't place at the time, it felt like a heavy weight had been lifted from my shoulders. 


It took a few weeks for the investigation to end, so I waited to head home until they told me I could do so. There was nowhere for me to stay in town, no point in heading home until I was able to enter the house. I was told that it was an accidental fire, caused by a cigarette. Internally I cursed myself for picking up my father's bad habit. It was something that my mother had always scolded my father for when I was young, and she had always given me distasteful looks when she saw me lighting one up as a teenager. The one thing I had in common with him, and it happened to be what tore my life apart. I'm thinking too deeply about it though. 


I learned that the fire was pretty much contained to their bedroom, it seemed that he had fallen asleep smoking, another topic of my mother's disapproval. It wasn't the first time, but it was definitely the last. They died in their sleep of smoke inhalation, gone before the flames even began. I was told to expect water damage throughout the upstairs and ground floor, but the structure was sound. 


On the drive towards the ruins of my childhood something nagged at me from the back of my mind. I chalked it up to my petrifying fear of fire, a phobia which inconvenienced my life at times, but I never knew the source of. I can light up a smoke, which I did many times throughout the drive, but open flames put me in a panic. *No campfires for me*, the thought made me wonder if my fear was the reason we had never gone camping as a family. I'd heard that my father was quite the outdoorsman before he became a parent. Maybe he was just bad at being a parent overall. I apologize, you'll notice that I'm prone to getting off track. 


Now I say burned down, but when I arrived it wasn't that dramatic. A large portion of the upper floor was blackened, and smoke damage was a major issue up there. The most serious damage was to the master bedroom obviously, I didn't dare enter that room. Not only was I warned that the floor might be more damaged now that the water had time to degrade it further, but I honestly couldn't bring myself to look at the room my parents died in, or a room that *anyone* died in for that matter.


I was nearly in tears seeing the disaster the fire had caused, it sent a deep chill through my body. Water damage had ruined many of the possessions that I had grown up seeing. I wasn't sure where to start, but I needed to work on packing the house up, or at least the parts of the house I could safely get to. Upstairs wasn't really a concern right now, most of the important belongings on that floor were located in the destroyed bedroom. My bedroom had been packed up when I moved away, it was a plain guest room now. Mom never saw any point in letting the room go to waste. 


There wasn't a lot that I could take, furniture was damaged or too big to leave with, most of the undamaged items on the first floor were useless. I collected photos and small trinkets, I had no idea what was worth taking, I just knew that I didn't want to be here long. I didn't even know if I wanted the mementos I had gathered, but maybe they'd help me recall my youngest days back when everything was normal and *happy*.


I was entirely overwhelmed by the situation and the memories that it brought forth, so I decided to go down to the basement. It was the only place left entirely intact after the fire. I thought that this would be the place where the items if my childhood might be stored, since the only traces in the rest of the house were the photos on display. My mother was ever the organizer, she enjoyed having a house worthy to be shown. 


The basement was a vast room of nothing, just old furniture that hadn't seen the light of day in years. Not nice antique furniture either, more like the cheap stuff that already cluttered the small apartment I live in. Reaching the bottom stair to survey the rest of the room sent a deep chill of foreboding through my body, but I assumed it was just the actual chill of the air combined with the darkness consuming the far corners of the room. I shrugged it off. Behind the worthless bookshelves and couches was a safe set into the far wall, one of the large stand-up ones. I don't know why I knew it was there, no one ever had cause to go near this half of the room. The water heater and such was against the wall nearest to the stairs. Nothing had moved in or out of this room for the entire duration of my life. 


There was something about the safe that tugged at the back of my mind. I was compelled to open it, though I doubted that my parents had put anything in it. It had to have been there when they bought the house, and was entirely overlooked. They likely never knew it was there. My mother refused to enter the basement at all, and my father was never interested in looking through old furniture. 


As I stood in front of the safe the combination for it seemed to appear in my mind suddenly, as though it had been waiting for this moment to arise from the depths. I wasn't sure why I knew the combination, but the random series of numbers that had popped up from an extremely fuzzy memory worked when I entered them. The safe unlocked. 


I opened it to find only one object inside, it was a small notebook. The cover read one word, *memini.* My first thought was that it was an odd title for a journal, and my next was: *I wonder how you pronounce that?* So, like a girl from every lame horror movie, I read the word out loud. The house didn't shake or collapse, the lights didn't flicker, the ground didn't open up to swallow me, no dark creatures crawled from the shadows to hurt me. But I remembered. 


My vision went dim and my eyes shut. It didn't come all at once, but it started with the most relevant memory to my current situation, which played out like a movie behind my eyelids. 


I was probably around seven years old, playing in the basement with another girl who was about 11. The space looked the same as it did now, save for the eerie feeling. We were having fun, running in and out of the safe which was held open by a chair back then. No one used it, no one cared to close it, no one really ever went in the basement at all. Except for us. We liked to explore, and we knew that no one else knew about the safe or they would have warned us away from it. Who would let children play near a safe big enough to hide in when no one knew the combination for it? 


We kept it a secret, it was our little fort, and as long as the door stayed propped open as it always did we were fine. But it didn't. One day the girl-- *Eve*, the sudden recollection of her name popped into my head-- closed the door on herself. She moved the chair that had always been there, and shut herself in. My tiny little mind panicked instantly when I heard the lock click. *Ohmygod momma is going to kill us. I have to get help. She's going to die in there!* 


Hey! Eve's muffled voice came from behind the thick safe door, Open the door, it's dark in here!


I can't, I spoke in a loud whisper, worried of alerting the adults before we had planned a good reason for doing something so careless, I don't know the code. 


Sure you do, or you will. I know it. She said confidently. How you could possibly feel confident while locked in a dark enclosed space was beyond what my young mind could believe, and I quickly became frustrated with her. 


No you don't! No one does, stop messin with me, I'm getting momma. I turned to leave, but her next words stopped me in my tracks. 


Cmon, I'm your big sister, would I lie to you? I'll tell you the code, and you let me out, and if it doesn't work then you can go get her, okay? Her pleading tone still managed to sound self-assured. Maybe that's what made me listen. She told me a number sequence, and I spun the lock accordingly. To my surprise it worked. 


I stared at her as she smugly walked out of the safe, and shut it behind her. How did you know? I asked her in awe. Our parents-- that thought jolted me as the memory played through-- didn't even know the safe was there, so how could Eve know the combination? 


Member when I told you I could see the future? I wasn't lying. I already saw this happen, and sometimes I see old things too! I saw an old lady open it up in a dream, it's really cool! She seemed excited to prove to me that the claims she had made several times before were true. 


I don't believe you! That's not even real, I was annoyed that she was faking some kind of magic power just to mess with me. I'm telling momma that you're lying! I was about to storm off, but she suddenly stood perfectly rigid. Her eyes clouded over until a milky white made it hard to identify where her pupils were hidden. 


She spoke in a soft voice, All will be lost, and fire shall return it to you. Then she burst into tears. 


Seeing my older sister cry sent me into another kind of panic, and I ran to console her. When her sobbing stopped, she looked to me with more seriousness than any 11 year old child should possess, It won't really be an accident. When I'm gone, you won't know it. But when you do know it, I'll be waiting for you, okay Lily? 


I nodded, but her words terrified me. I didn't understand what had just happened, and she convinced me not to tell our parents. At the time I had no idea what she meant by those strange words, but the random memory that had taken hold of my body released me as my younger self nodded in agreement to the secret. 


Suffice to say I was absolutely floored by what had just played out in my head. The basement felt colder than it had just moments before I read the word on the cover, and the darkness seemed to thicken. I decided to leave and gather my thoughts elsewhere. Suddenly being here felt wrong. I had been hoping to find happy memories, but I was quickly coming to the realization that I might have found ones worse than the past I already knew. 


I kept hold of the journal, adding it to the other mementos I had collected. There was nothing else I wanted, and I wasn't sure that I'd want to even come back here once all the damage was repaired. It hadn't felt safe here for a long time, and my newly resurfacing memories made the house feel haunted. 


As I drove back to my apartment the revelation hit me hard. I had a *sister*. It brought up so many questions. Why couldn't I remember her before? Why did that word trigger that memory? Was it real, or were there chemicals still floating in the air from the items burned in the fire that caused me to hallucinate? Did she really see the things she said? Why didn't my parents tell me I had a sister? Most important of all, if this is real then, where is she now? It all *seemed* so real, and the chill I got from thinking about her fire prediction made me curious and afraid. 


Between getting lost in my thoughts I noticed something odd. A dark car had pulled out of the neighborhood with me, and after over an hour it was still there. Whoever was driving was keeping a distance, but I could just *tell* that I was being followed. I tried to ignore it, but I kept my eye out for the car the entire way home. I kept thinking over my discovery though, and vaguely wondered if the person following me was related or if I was just paranoid due to what I had learned. 


If I had a sister, and she predicted that in the future there would be a fire that would cause me to remember, then doesn't that mean she was right? Doesn't that mean that the memory was *true?* Maybe her disappearing is the reason my parents hated me so much, maybe it's the reason I almost didn't live long enough to move away from home. 


All I knew at that point was that I would need to see what else was in that journal, I needed answers for what I saw. If I really had a sister, then why don't I have any memories of her ever really existing? 

**Update:**

As I pulled into a parking lot of a random building several blocks from my place I saw the car that had been tailing me stop. Whoever it was had parked about two blocks away, but no one got out of the car. It freaked me out, it would be a stretch to think that someone coincidentally left my old neighborhood and drove all the way here at the *same* time as me. I don't know why, but a violent shiver shot down my spine. I felt watched. I didn't trust it at all, I made a quick phone call to one of my roommates to let them know I'd be home in a bit. 


Instead of parking completely I drove out the other exit of the lot. I had only stopped for a brief moment to park and hoped whoever was driving would think it was just for the phone call. I drove to a friends old apartment several streets over, parked in their lot and entered the building through the front door, carrying the box of mementos. As I watched the front door shut behind me I saw the car pull up to a stop across the street. *Good.* 


I might have been half insane over what I had learned earlier, but I wasn't being too paranoid about this. I had thought before that it was possible I was seeing several cars of the same color and worrying myself for nothing, but being followed here solidified the fact that someone really was tailing me. I walked deeper into the building, down some stairs, and out the back door into an alley. 


I followed the alley down several blocks until I hit a busy street, with the car nowhere in sight I felt safer. It took me nearly an hour to get to my own apartment after making these stops, but it was worth it to throw off my stalker. 


When I got back to my apartment my roommates seemed off. Not only did they comment on how pale I looked, but apparently a man had come looking for me. As if this day hadn't been odd enough, I didn't actually know any guys who I had given my address to. My level of paranoia increased greatly, even though there could have been a rational explanation. 


I asked the girls about him, and the three of them each gave a slightly different description. They didn't disagree with each other though, even though there were some obvious contradictions. 


Hey Lee, you okay? Not to add more to your plate, but some old guy I was here asking for you a few hours ago, Maya told me as she wrapped me in a hug, We told him you weren't here, but he left a card. 


She handed me the card, but before I had the chance to look at it Allison came running from her room, Did you tell her about that cute guy that came looking for her? Like damn Lily, why'd you keep tall, dark, and handsome a secret? I tell you about the guys *Im* dating. She smiled at me as though waiting for some lurid details about this guy, but I was confused. 


Wait, so two people were here for me? I asked. 


What? No, just the one, grey hair and blue eyes. Maybe someone from the insurance company, Maya shrugged and headed for the kitchen.


Yup, that was him, Allie agreed, Dark hair, green eyes, just *gorgeous.* She sighed and threw herself dramatically onto the couch. I looked at them both, neither of them seemed to realize that they were describing two vastly different people. 


Are you fucking with me? You're not even saying the same things. They replied to me by staring at me like I had grown a second head. 


Maybe you should go lay down, you've had a long day, Maya came back over to me, put her hand on my shoulder, and gave me a concerned look.


I felt like everything today was made to drive me crazy, so I just sighed and took my box of junk to the bedroom I shared with our other roommate. She wasn't home yet, so I decided to call her. I told her where my car was, and I asked if she'd drive it home for me. It was on her way so she agreed, she didn't want to take the bus home with a load of groceries. Hopefully it had been long enough for the tail to leave, or at least be thrown off by someone else driving my car. 


I sat on my bed and finally took a look at the card, *Mister Midnight. We'll call you.* What the fuck was this guy, a magician? There was no number on the card just the name and the small message below it, both in embossed glittery silver script. I was confused as to why this guy even bothered to leave a card, and why he came looking for me at all. Today of all days. 


The day just seemed to be confusion on top of confusion. I decided to forget about the guy for now and look inside the journal from the safe. I was about to open it when I heard the front door open and quickly slam shut. 


Shit guys, it's freezing out there. Oh hey, is Lee here still? Saw that blonde guy walking around her car when I picked it up, I heard Raven asking as she made her way towards our room loudly and swung the door open, Oh hey babe, did the girls tell you about your weird ass visitor? 


I guess, kinda? You're all confusing me honestly. How was he weird anyways? I was a bit fed up with everyone acting so odd. 


I dunno, he just had this creepy vibe about him, and he was lurking around your car which is sketchy as hell. I almost wanted to yell at him to get out of here, but he freaked me out for some reason. He took off when I walked up to it though. Everyone else seems to like him, no clue why, She shrugged and started rifling through the bags she had come in with. 


I figured it would be easier to just ignore the fact someone had come looking for me and focus on something else for a while. Though I was definitely freaked out that whoever had visited the apartment had somehow found my car quite a distance away. It didnt make any sense. Maybe it could have been insurance people who came to visit and followed me for hours, but I highly doubted it. Things werent adding up and it worried me, but it wasnt something I could deal with immediately. Instead of dwelling on the strangers who were following and looking for me, I opened up the journal to the first page. 


*If you're reading this, then Mom and Dad are dead. Or at least the things that were pretending to be them. You've been stained by darkness, and now it follows close behind, I'm so sorry Lily. Everything you know is veiled. Think closely about your life without me before you go on.* 


Think closely? This all seemed extremely cryptic, and I felt like someone was intentionally fucking with me. My life without a sister was definitely different than I would soon remember. 


I was happy as a kid, normal and cheerful with loving parents. Things changed around the time I was 11, but I've never known why. My parents seemed to withdraw from the society around them, no more bake sale participation, no more church, no more family outings. My mother had been the ideal Christian PTA parent, but all of those traits seemed to leave her as I got older. My father had been a car enthusiast, but he lost the joy for it. 


Instead they stayed inside most days, away in their room, going out to bars and parties on the evenings and weekends. The older I got, the more bitter they seemed. They no longer had time for me and my insignificant school problems, but I assumed it was a side effect of your only child turning into a teenager. Things got a little rough, my mother seemed to despise me, my father just seemed to ignore that I was even there. 


They fed me, clothed me, gave me a home, but interacted with me minimally. When I was 17 there was one incident which stood out. It was nearing the time of my high school graduation, and my girlfriend at the time had snuck into my room late at night, not a completely random occurrence but not very common either. 


We had been dating for several months, but I had never brought the topic up with my parents. I wasn't sure how they would react to the fact that I was dating a girl, especially because she was transitioning. My mother had been arrogantly Christian when I was younger, and though we had stopped attending church I wasn't sure if her righteous tendencies had halted as well. 

The encounter started out as odd as it had ended. I woke up in the middle of the night to a cold breeze, my window was open. I moved to get out of bed and suddenly a boy was in front of me. It took me a moment for my panic to subside and realize that I was actually looking at my girlfriend. She would have been pissed if she knew I had mistaken her for a boy, but I could swear that she looked different than usual. 


Tara? Did you sneak in my window? Instead of answering, she leaned in to kiss me and my fear seemed to disappear. When I opened my eyes I noticed that the dark room made it seem like the whites of her eyes were gone, the entirety of her eyes appeared to be a black void. I blinked a few times and they returned to normal. I felt like I was forgetting something important. 


Come with me, She led me by the hand to my window, Jump, it's not that far. I felt dazed, but my human instinct told me this was wrong. I was on the second floor, the ground below my window was all patio stones. Our house was tall, the ground floor had high ceilings, it would equate to nearly a three story drop from the edge of my window to the ground. *This is wrong.* 


I pulled my hand from her grip and backed away from the window. There was no jumping, you'd have to climb the flimsy lattice that decorated the house. She grabbed my wrist tightly and dragged me back towards the window. 


Come on, I need to take you. Her appearance seemed to shift as I returned to a state of panic. She looked like her, but *not*. Her features seemed to shift to more masculine, taller, broader, shorter hair, sharper jaw, eyes once again bottomless black pits. 


Who are you, what are you *doing!?* I struggled to get away from whoever or whatever was holding me. Suddenly my bedroom door swung wide, and there stood my parents. I gave one last effort to wrench my arm away, and I was free. As that *thing* turned to look at them it returned to the appearance of my girlfriend, but now with an absolutely terrified look on her face. 


Escort that shameful thing out of my house. Tara visibly flinched when my mother spoke those words. I had no idea what was going on anymore, so I took her hand softly and led her downstairs. I stood by the door as she left, wondering if she would change again or if I had dreamed that part. My thoughts were interrupted by the door being slammed closed on the hand I'd left resting on the frame. 


I backed away as soon as the door swung back open, and stared at my mother in horror. *What the fuck?* My wrist was already bruising from Tara holding me, and now it felt like I might have a broken finger or two. My mother smiled at me as she came towards me, she grabbed my hair and proceeded to drag me back upstairs. 


Why would you let something like that into the house? Honestly, do you *want* to go to hell? She spoke calmly as she pulled me along, not a hint of exertion. I didn't understand what was happening. We entered my bedroom, and she brought me back to the still open window, pressing my face against the sill, I can send you if that's your wish, you little brat.


Her hand gripped the window as though she was going to bring it down on my neck, and I was absolutely terrified. I tried to get away, but my struggles did nothing. She brought the window down, but it was stopped by another hand. 


It isn't our place to do this. You need to let her go, they need everything to play out, My father spoke calmly, as though he hadn't just watched his wife attempt to crush the throat of his only child. She released me, and walked out of the room without a word, Go to sleep, forget this. He followed behind her and shut my door. 


I tried to convince myself it had all been a dream, but my hand and wrist were bruised the next day. Later that day I found out Tara had been hit by a car on her way home, she didn't even survive until she got to the hospital. It was the worst two days of my life, not only might she be alive if she hadn't come to see me, but the last time we had been together I went crazy thinking she wasn't herself. I felt like shit. 


Two months later I graduated, a few weeks after that I had found an apartment with Maya near the college we'd be attending. I turned 18 in July and moved out on my birthday, even though my parents had gone back to ignoring my existence. Best gift I could get. It didn't feel right to be there, as though something bad was about to happen at every moment. 


Recalling my past left me feeling vulnerable, less than two years is not enough time to completely put that incident aside. I felt some comfort that Raven was in the room, her and Maya knew most of what had happened back home. I gathered myself and went back to reading. The next words got me mad, I was sure I was being fucked with. 


*Everything really happened. It was all real. They veiled themselves, but did not know to veil the other demon.* 


Okay, what the fuck guys? I don't know why or how you got this book into my house, but it's not funny at all. I'm sick of all this. Someone tell me why, *NOW,* I started yelling as I stormed around the apartment, waving the journal around. 


Raven tried to hold on to me, and the others just stared as though I was completely insane. I cried and begged for answers, but none of them knew what I was talking about. I was a confused emotional wreck. The girls provided no answers, they were honestly innocent. Maya suggested that maybe I should look more into the journal. I couldnt quite grasp the demon bit of what I had already read, but Id look more into the journal later for elaboration.


I don't have the time to tell you more right now, but I'll keep updating every few days. Weird things keep happening around here, and I still have to attempt to get to my classes. All I can tell you right now is that this is what started the process of my entire life going to shit. Or rather, worse shit than I already experienced in the past.

<TEXT> I was unaware that eating human flesh rather than healthy diet food was considered "normal human behavior", let me know how that works out in your life :) 

I would describe anyone as repulsive and lazy if they'd rather eat meat from their own body than make a healthy food choice. They could be 105lbs and it would be disgusting, lazy, and morally wrong. 

But I said mean things about a person who happened to be large, so I must hate fat people? Get a grip.

<TEXT> He was entirely content living life before he got too large to do so. He over indulged, but he went out, he had friends and fun, and as soon as he was big enough for those regular interactions to be inconvenient, he stopped caring about them. 

He wasn't ever depressed, he was just lazy and only cared about being comfortable. It's not that he hated being alive, he just hated any version of living that involved putting effort in to it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I Tried To Force My Husband Into Losing Weight </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-16 17:41:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ive always been concerned about my husband's health. He was overweight since the day we met, but he never really tried to fix it. It wasnt really a concern in the beginning. Sure, being bigger isnt a bad thing, but thats only true until it negatively impacts your health and your ability to function. It wasnt that he needed to fix his weight problem the entire time, but he really should have taken some steps to avoid getting bigger. He ignored the issue for so long that I by the time I stepped in he must have been over 400 pounds.


He had trouble walking, he never wanted to get out of bed, in fact he hardly wanted to do anything at all. I loved the poor guy, but he was a fucking mess. It was ridiculous. He had no motivation to even attempt diet or exercise. He complained about walking from bed to the bathroom, and absolutely despised going outside for any reason. He was slowly killing himself.


I couldnt take it, it was painful for me to watch him suffer and literally not give a shit about it. I know its has to be hard to live like that, but he didnt *care.* Hed been told by myself and other doctors that he had to prove that he could lose weight through diet and exercise before he could get surgery, and he refused. He would rather be a disgusting recluse at home than do even something simple to fix himself. He hadnt let himself die yet, but he was hardly living at all. 


One day I had finally had enough. The night before, he had almost rolled over on me in his sleep. It was the last straw for me. He'd nearly killed me. I couldn't take it anymore, and I needed to take things into my own hands. If he wasn't going to help himself, then I was going to have to do something drastic. There's no way he would be able to continue living this way, at least not for very long. That was the day I told him that I was going to help him solve his problems. He was less than excited, he didnt *want* to be fixed because that would mean living life.


He didnt care that he could hardly walk, he didnt care that he ate at least six meals a day, and he absolutely did not care that he was no longer the person I had fallen in love with. He had become this lazy pig with no desire to live life. The only thing he wanted in the world was to stay in bed, eat food, and watch TV. I wasnt about to let him give up that easy. After the procedure he would *want* to stay in shape. Once it was done there was no way hed ever want to go back to his repulsive lifestyle. Maybe wed rekindle our spark.


It took me a few weeks, but I finally was able to collect everything I needed from the hospital that I worked in. I set everything up so that he could stay in our bed while I worked. I put him under, and once I was sure that he was entirely unconscious I began my work. It was a long process, and I wouldn't be able to do everything in one day. Though plastic surgery is my field of expertise, he was a special case. Our home didn't have quite the same amenities as a hospital, some of those which he would need to heal as per usual. The healing process would need to be done slightly different than it would if he had actually gone in to get the work done.


After the first part of the surgery was done I waited for him to wake up. I was so excited for him to see what I had done, but it wasn't time yet. I knew I knew he would be hungry when he woke up, so I decided to make him breakfast while he was still under. Knowing him, any dietary restrictions I gave him would be aggressively ignored. I had thought that he would be ravenous as soon as he woke up, and I was correct. The first thing he asked for when he awoke was food. I smiled at him and handed him the plate. He had just lifted a piece of the bacon from the plate when I stopped him.


Are you sure you want to eat that honey, it isnt pork, I said with the sweetest smile I could muster on my face.


This would be the true test to see if he was ready to finally lose all this weight. This would also be the test that proved whether or not he was actually as disgusting as I had come to know.


Well what is it, hun? The piece of bacon was dangling from his lips as he asked. 


It's human bacon. Do you still want to eat it? This was a moment of truth.


I watched, absolutely repulsed as he took my statement into account and chewed the bacon in his mouth. He savored it for a moment, as though he was trying to discover every aspect of the flavor. Then he stopped.


No, no. I'm not doing this. Go get me some real food, He said it suddenly, as though he'd only just realized that it would be wrong to eat human flesh.


I'm not giving you anything else. You can either diet and eat the food that goes with it, or deal with this, I followed up by leaving the room to get him a plate of something healthy.


By the time I came back the plate was empty. I was appalled. I knew he was a pig, but I didn't know he would go to such lengths.


I brought you something so you can start your diet. You won't keep the weight off unless you eat healthy. I told him, trying to hide the nausea that coursed through my body. How could he eat that bacon after what I had told him? Could anyone really be so *sick?*


He chuckled for a moment, This is just some kind of trick to convince me to lose weight. I'm fine. I'm not doing your diet nonsense. I like the way that I live now. There's nothing wrong with me.


I was shocked at his response, and I nearly dropped the plate I was holding.


You've got to be kidding me, you'd rather eat your own flesh than attempt to lose even a little bit of the weight? Don't you want to live the life that we used to have? Dont you miss being able to walk more than ten steps without being out of breath? I was losing it, he was so adamantly against doing anything to help himself.


I told you already. I'm fine. There's no point in lying to me to try and convince me that something is wrong. I *do* have taste buds you know? Obviously this bacon is veal. Which is nice because usually you don't go for something so expensive. You ought to feed me better, I need a lot of sustenance you know.


I turned to walk out of the room. I was entirely disgusted by his attitude towards everything, and in his disbelief. His voice stopped me as I reached the door.


Oh by the way hun, I'm still numb from the chest down.


That would be the anesthetic, I snipped at him and walked out of the room.


Over the next week all of his meals consisted of meat from his own flesh. He insisted that it was veal, and wouldn't believe a thing I said otherwise. At this point I was too repulsed by his response to continue with it, and I decided to do the one thing that would prove to him that I hadnt lied about feeding him human meat. I went into the room that morning and removed the cloth that kept his paralyzed body hidden from view. Then I removed the bandages that were covering the wounds.


What did you do? He asked in surprise as he stared at the deep, scabbed over cuts that covered his once large stomach.


We're running out of fat to get the bacon from, I told you that it wasn't veal.


You know what, He said, I don't care anymore. Never did. It's the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. If it makes you happy we can keep doing this. He smiled at me as though it was an enticing offer.


That day I packed a suitcase, I walked out of the house, and I never went home. It's been months now, and I've moved far away. I think I've created a monster.

I've been seeing this post everywhere today, It's so weird?! I wonder if the person it was meant for has seen it? 


Saw this in the comments before I decided to share: 


This post from the Missed Connections section of Craigslist is going viral, the same post was posted in numerous locations on the site. Many visitors to the site have shared the post, citing it as creepy and obsessive, what do you think? 


Yea, I'm thinking it's a bit crazy.

### Almost Your Time 


I have seen you so many times. So many close encounters when we have almost had the chance to meet. Every time one of these close chances happen, it makes me want you more. It seems that you are just always slightly out of my grasp. I know that most would say you are lucky to avoid me, but I think that you might enjoy getting to know me. 


You are so much like many others, yet at the same time you are so unique. I know that you are not the type of person who would regularly be looking at a posting like this, but you are the type to notice when something goes viral. I know this is the type of message that will get passed around, and eventually you will see it. 


Many of our previous close encounters you have had no idea that I was there. That is usually how it is for most people I get close with. I have had more than my fair share of those who are aware of me, those who accept me, and come willingly. Some of those aware decide to try and avoid me, but nearly every person I have set my eyes upon has eventually succumbed to my dark charm. 


There are some who find me appealing, desirable. Those who seek me out when I don't want them to, when I am not prepared for them to fall into my arms. You would think that it makes things easier, but it can be very overwhelming. I know you used to be one of those people, you craved me at one point in time. Now you have pushed me out of your mind entirely, I think you may have forgotten that I even exist. Are you mad at me? For stealing someone you loved, or perhaps for not answering your calls when you used to cry for me to come and take you away from the pain you lived with? 


You know I could not do that. You were not ready for me, as much as you thought you were. It is rare for someone to decide to take being with me into their own hands, even more so for a person to succeed in getting to me by themselves. I am not strictly against such things, but I am better at knowing when the time is right. I am sorry if you have put me out of your mind, if you had thought it would be decades before we came close to one another, this is not the case. 


You have evaded me so many times, those times were not right for us. Soon. Three days in fact, at 11:04pm. I will be there, we will face each other again, and this time there is no avoiding me. We can finally be together, I hope you enjoy the time you have. 


- do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers

<TEXT> I'll definitely take this into consideration, I'm not sure if I'll do it before passing it off though. I don't want to be quarantined or something, I'd rather wait to check for residual symptoms and then inform the next person that they should see a doctor. 

It sounds selfish, but I don't want to be the one stuck in a hospital for who knows how long. Plus the pills are only going to be given to me with two weeks worth of doses at a time. If I go to a hospital and they can't recreate the pill within two weeks, I'm dead. There's no way an anonymous supplier that probably created the disease inside me is going to deliver to a hospital.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd feel bad about passing it off to the elderly. The amount of unwilling people who would touch them in a hospice would give a noticeable death toll. Maybe people who are already dying, that would be less awful, but harder to actually do unless they're dying out in the open. 

Can't exactly walk into a hospital room and touch patients willy-nilly. Passing it off to someone alert enough to keep themselves alive would be the best option, or it'll come back to me, or pass on unchecked after a day of the pill is forgotten.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of us started hearing this around middle school; the campaigns, slogans, presentations, and whatnot. *Just Say No To Drugs!* They wanted to get the message across while we were still young and compliant, before we got the urge to experiment. I never found it very effective. If you want to try something, then you don't really concern yourself with lectures you received when you were 12.


For my entire life I didn't really care about those lectures. When I first got them I thought they were ridiculous, *who is doing drugs at 12?* When I was 13 I started trying things out, mostly because that was the age when my depression first reared its ugly head. After that, it didn't matter. *This makes me feel better. I can ignore how sad I am.* The rest is history. 


That brings me to what happened last weekend. My best friend, Sadie, and I decided to go out to a club. It was a Friday night and we planned to have some fun. It started off as a regular night, drinking and dancing together. I was standing near the bar waiting on my drink when a guy walked up to me.


Looking? He mouthed. 


I shrugged and he gestured towards an empty table near the back of the club. I grabbed my drink and walked over to meet him back there. I sat next to him and he showed me a small pink pill with an eye engraved on it. 


E? I asked. 


He hesitated, then nodded, 10 per, but I'll cut it to 70$ total if you want the whole bag,


70$ for ten pills? That was a pretty sweet deal as far as I was concerned. Too good to be true honestly. 


Any good? I questioned skeptically. 


Probably the best you'll ever take, 


I wasn't convinced on his pitch, but a high is a high. This wouldn't be something new, and it'd be relatively cheap. As we made the handshake exchange he gripped my hand. 


Take one right now so I know you're not a cop, He said tensely. 


I popped a pill into my mouth, washing it down with my drink. He visibly relaxed and gave me his number after, told me to let him know when I needed more. I was set, I finished off my drink. I was headed back to the bar to see if I could get some water when Sadie stepped in front of me. 


What did you just do? She set her eyes on me like it was an interrogation. 


Nothing? It's fine, I shrugged off her accusatory glare. 


I saw the guy, why can't you just say no? She frowned at me, not a fan of my recreational activities. 


I *can* say no. I just don't want to. Seriously, I'm fine. Don't worry about it,


She rolled her eyes and walked back into the crowd of people. I brushed off our disagreement and got my water. About 5 minutes later I felt the pill kick in. I felt an overwhelming sense of warmth, and then things got odd. The edges of my vision faded to black, my chest felt heavy, and my limbs tingled. My vision blacked out entirely for a moment, and when it returned everything was beautiful. 


My mind was floating, I was *so* happy. Everything was more colorful, the room almost glowed. It felt like my vision was sharper, dark corners were easier to see, and I felt *good.* This was insane, this isn't what was supposed to happen. Maybe the dealer was right, this was the best of *anything* I'd ever had. I'd never experienced anything like it, and it would be worth the eventual crash. 


Based on everything I was feeling this was definitely *not* E. It wasn't even close. It was *better.* I was slightly concerned that I had no idea what he had actually sold me, but I'd text him later to address it. I'm not a picky person, maybe it was something new on the market. I really didn't care that much, I'm known for doing anything to avoid having to think about my life and my past. This was just another distraction from real life. 


About twenty minutes later I went to the bathroom, that's when things got crazy. There was a girl wearing glittery blue eyeliner in there, and I found myself transfixed on the glitter. She gave me an odd look, and I could tell she was annoyed at my staring. I turned away but she had apparently already decided to confront me. 


What are you staring at? She asked harshly. 


Nothing now, I replied with equal venom as I adjusted my own make up in the mirror, I was just looking at your makeup,


I don't know if she misheard me or if maybe she was high, but she grabbed my shoulder and spun me to face her. I was ready to tear into her, but my vision went black for a split second. When it cleared I was horrified. The glittery eyed girl had fallen to her knees, blood was pouring from her eyes. She didn't make a sound as she clawed at her throat, long nails leaving deep gashes. 


This had to be a hallucination. Is this why the pills were so cheap? A split second and suddenly you're having the worst trip of your life? I freaked out, I ran out of the bathroom to get away from the awful sight my mind had created. I searched the club for Sadie, I needed to get home and lie down. When I found her she instantly knew something was wrong. 


Are you okay? What happened? Her voice was full of concern. 


I'll tell you after, please take me home. I pleaded. 


She nodded and led me outside to her car. On the drive back I explained the terrifying hallucination. She glanced at me with a look of disappointment. Her judgement annoyed me, and I ignored her for the rest of the drive. As soon as she pulled up in front of her apartment I hopped out and went inside. She followed me while still trying to get me to respond to her guilt trip. 


I got into her place and threw myself onto the bed, I was getting pretty upset at this point. Sadie walked into my room, still lecturing. 


Ohmygod Sade, can you chill out? I'm not dying, this shit happens sometimes. Stop fucking *parenting* me! I lost it, I was done with her talking down to me. 


She look dejected, I'm just worried about you, you're gonna end up killing yourself, 


Please stop. I'm fine. Haven't died yet, have I? I gave her a pointed look, knowing my response wasn't what she wanted. 


She reached out and gripped my shoulder in a motherly manner, and I violently pulled away. I *hated* when she did parental gestures, it did nothing to ease my annoyance. My vision flicked to black for a moment, and I wish it had stayed that way. 


When it cleared Sadie was in front of me clutching at her throat, digging her nails into her own flesh. Her mouth opened in a silent scream as her eyes filled and spilled over with blood, she stared at me with a look of betrayal. I didn't understand what was happening, the hallucination seemed so *real.* I couldn't contain myself, I kneeled by her and tried to hold her hands away from her body. 


She froze for a moment, letting her hands fall. The look on her face was now full of despair and she whispered something. 


It came out of you, She said softly. 


What? I gripped her hands in mine, she visibly paled. 


He did something to you, 


Those are the last words I heard, the blood leaking from her eyes began to slow, and I could feel her getting cold. I was thoroughly freaked out. I looked at my hands which were covered in her blood, and abruptly got up and left. *I'm having a really bad trip, I need to go to my own house and sleep it off.* It was a quick few blocks to my house, and I crashed as soon as I hit the bed. 


I didn't wake up until late the next afternoon, it was almost dusk. I was so confused, and it felt like the high hadn't faded. I looked at my hands to find that they were smeared with dried blood. *Hallucinations don't usually work like this.* Maybe there's some other explanation for the blood? What I saw couldn't have been real. I was scared, so I did the first rational thing that came to mind. 

What the fuck did you sell me? I asked as soon as the dealer answered the call. 


It uh.. A long story. Fun right? He laughed nervously. 


No, not fun. They're giving me some kind of crazy hallucinations. What are they? 


That means they're working. I'm so sorry man, His tone perked up, I'll make sure the supplier knows that I passed it on. Someone will meet you when you run out, okay? 


Not okay?! Dude, what the fuck? What is happening? My heart was racing, I didn't understand what he was telling me. 


Okay, here's the deal. Don't let anyone touch you, alright? Take one a day. Don't forget that. Also, there are no hallucinations. It's not a drug, it's an *antidote.* Deal with it, or pass it off. He hung up the phone. 


*Shit.* I only sort of understood it all, and this guy sounded crazy as hell. Maybe that's what these pills *really* do to you. I felt entirely drained and decided to go back to sleep, my body hated what I had put inside of it. 


I woke up before dawn in extreme pain. It felt like something was growing inside of my throat, stretching inside until I felt like my neck would explode. The pain was so intense that I burst into tears, and ran into the bathroom. My vision blurred into a pink haze. The sight that faced me from the mirror renewed my fears, I could see there was blood running from my eyes. I opened my mouth to see if the source of pain was visible, and it was. The inside of my mouth and throat seemed to be grey and black, like the flesh was dying. I gagged as I watched a piece of my cheek flake onto my tongue. 


I panicked, for a moment I had no idea what to do. I recalled the phone call, he was right about one thing so far. It's been almost two days, and there's no way this was a hallucination. Maybe he wasn't crazy at all. *Take one a day.* It was the only solution I could think if. I found the pills still tucked into the pocket of my jeans. 


Ten minutes after taking one the pain subsided. The blood stopped coming, and I felt *really* good. I checked my throat in the mirror, whatever I had seen before was no longer visible. My cheek was bleeding slightly, but the rot had apparently been cured. 


I've had some time to think about this whole thing. It's been four days since I took the first pill. If I go more than twenty-four hours without taking one, then I experience those awful side effects. I talked to the dealer again this morning, he told me the basics and what my options are in better detail. 


There's something inside me. It's transferred by touch. If you don't take a pill after you've been touched, you start experiencing the effects within a minute. If you don't take a pill once a day, you start experiencing the effects. Those effects are some sort of necrosis that eats you from the inside. There are three options once you've caught it. You can let it kill you and it will move on to someone else, you can touch someone else and give them the pills, or you can spend the rest of your life hoping the supplier doesn't run out so that you can live with it. 


The way it transfers is odd, it *leaves* you to infect someone else. If they take a pill as soon as they're infected, it stays with them. If they die without taking a pill, it comes back to you. All this information did nothing but terrify me even more. What if the supplier does run out? I don't want to die this way. 


I'm passing it on, I'm going to every club, every rave, every night until I do. There's a lot of people besides me that don't feel the need to *just say no.* I'll have this thing out of me before I need to restock pills. 


My only advice to you, those who enjoy being distracted from real life, those eager to try something new, if someone is selling pink pills engraved with an eye you should avoid them. Don't let them touch you. In fact, if someone walks up to you in a club, bar, party or something and asks if you want to buy something *just say no.*

<TITLE> I Witnessed A Murder That I Didn't See </TITLE>

<TEXT> I was born blind. Zero sight. I can't see anything, I've never been able to at all. That all changed two days ago, and now I'm chasing glimpses of what any Sighted person would take for granted. 


I was on my regular walk home from work, it was about 6pm. I live in a fairly large city in Ontario, and from my understanding it was getting dark outside. It was a cold night, and I was happy to be done for the week. Nothing feels quite as nice as leaving work on a Friday night. 


A group of drunken girls ended up running into me on my walk. I heard their tipsy footsteps and loud laughter approaching, but didn't think they would be intoxicated enough to walk into a man who was quite obviously blind. Apparently they were, a cacophony of loud giggles and mumbled apologies bumped into me. I was shocked by the pungent odour of cheap liquor and even cheaper perfume. 


It was early for such activities to already be happening, but I suppose some young girls want to take full advantage of the weekend. I could understand it, but what confused me was that they all stopped, surrounding me. Two girls somewhere in front of me got into an argument. 


Ohmygod, you idiot! You just walked into a blind guy! A shrill yell. I didn't correct her, *several* of the group had walked into me. 


Shut up! It was an accident, he doesn't care anyways. Stop, let's go, An annoyed girl shot back. 


Um, I *can* hear you, you know? It's only my eyes that aren't up to par. I laughed, hoping to lighten the tension that surrounded me. I had no idea why the first girl has gotten heated so quickly about a simple drunken accident. 


It was rude. I'm sorry, sir. The first girl responded. 


No, no, I'm-- I was abruptly cut off. 


Stop being such a kiss-ass. He's *fine.* The second girl interrupted. 


Suddenly it happened, a bright flash of color exploded in front of my sightless eyes, at the same time as I heard the hard *slap* of skin connecting with skin. I was shocked, this was something I had never experienced before. It was hot, yet timid. Not hot like a fire, but like the stinging warmth in your cheeks after an unexpected compliment. Sharp, vibrant, obnoxious, the color of teenaged girls, wild slumber parties, and exciting first kisses. It was a group of young girls dancing to a song on the Top 40. It was the color of intense passion, heated arguments over what bar to go to next, and the feeling of someone attractive looking your way. 


I was struck still, the girls surrounding me were speaking as though they had forgotten my presence. 


You bitch! Why did you slap me? The annoyed girl spoke in anger. 


I-- I have no idea. I don't know what came over me, I just got so frustrated. I'm sorry, I'm drunk, maybe I should go home.. The shrill girl now sounded confused and defeated. 


The group ignored me and began walking away while talking, I had no idea what had just happened. I was thoroughly confused, and found myself turned around. I usually had a good sense of direction, but the entire incident had thrown me off. I collected myself, and began walking in what I assumed to be the direction home. 


I heard the familiar noise of a sports broadcast coming from a pub filled with mostly loud men, I was definitely going the right way. I paused when I heard a scuffle near the door to the pub. Something inside me told me to *watch.* I nearly laughed aloud at the voice in my head, *you can't see, remember?* As if my mind was having a conversation with itself the little voice replied, *but what if you can?* 


I paused on the sidewalk, partially because I didn't want to get too close to the potential fight that was beginning, and partially because I was listening to my brain. *What if it happens again? What if I could see something?* 


Let me back in! A man whined from near the door. 


You need to relax, the owner doesn't want you around when you're like this, The security guard replied in a calm, deep tone. You could tell he was the bigger man merely from listening to the conversation. 


Suddenly, another flash. You could hear the smaller man lunge toward the security guard, throwing his weight and fists against him in a pathetic attempt to force his way back inside. There was more than one color this time. First something deep and dark. The color of deep, and undying love. A color of rage. It was the feeling in your heart on your wedding day, passion that is coupled with adoration. It was violent and angry, while still being deep and meaningful. It was fists on bare flesh, fire, heat, and pain. It was aggressive. 


As the man was obviously dragged away, the flash of color changed. It was bright, and shocking. It was the embodiment of shame and embarrassment, but at the same time also represented happiness. It was warm. It was days at the beach with loved ones, it was a morning waking up with no worries and the warm sunlight on your face. It was anxiety, rejection and humiliation. Stuttering in front of a classroom and being laughed at, being turned down for a date, or being brushed aside by someone larger you had tried to fight. 


The feeling that ran through me was pleasure and excitement to the Nth degree. I felt amazing. I *saw* something. I had no idea what to do about it, but I floated home in a state of pure euphoria. I *needed* to see more. Color was a drug, and I was quickly becoming addicted. 


I slept deeper that night than I never had before, it was like crashing after a high. 


When my wife woke me in the morning I wanted to share the news with her. She didn't understand how it was possible, and I'm not sure that she believed me. I know I must have sounded crazy, but I asked her if she could at least try to identify the colors I was describing. Pink, red, and yellow were her best guesses. They sounded right, but I really didn't have a lot of past experience to go on. I was filled with joy, and I could tell that my wife was at least happy that I *believed* I had seen something. 


I wanted to spend my day walking the streets in search for color, but I had to wait until my wife left. I knew she was already skeptical about my newfound sight and I didn't want her to worry about me roaming the city *blindly.* Pun intended. She was washing up some breakfast dishes when she suddenly yelled in pain. At moment I received a new flash. 


Bright, surprising, close to what my wife had told me was yellow. It was a color of surprise, and frustration. It was happy, yet slightly angry. It was a color of rebellion, and sunsets. It was the warm feeling of sitting near a fireplace, and the excitement of going on a trip to somewhere new. It was mild anger and annoyance, and the feeling of fullness after a good meal. 


It changed rapidly. Suddenly burning hot. I could *feel* the color. Dark, angry, violent. It was what my wife had already identified to be red, but it *felt* different than when I had seen it on the street during the burst of angry. Now it felt hungry and vicious. It was the feelings of life seeping out of a body, pain, despair, and hatred. 


The flash shocked me as the others did, but this time I was slightly afraid. My mind ached to see more, and I was horrified. I knew she had hurt herself, but my mind was screaming at me to find more of this color. 


Babe, I swallowed the thick taste of desire in my throat, Are you okay?


Mhmm, don't worry hun, just a small cut. She replied, I could tell from her voice that it was true. 


My reaction to the color scared me, but I couldn't help it. I could almost taste the copper in my mouth, and the sensation made me salivate. I was disgusted with myself and assumed it was just my brain craving the stimulation of sight for the first time in its twenty-four years of existence. The mind is a tricky thing, and I couldn't help that mine was rapidly becoming addicted to color. 


My wife bandaged her hand and set off for work. I nearly went running out of the house once she was gone, needing to satiate the yearning that wracked my body. I walked the streets, heading in the direction that would lead me to the unsavory part of town. It seemed that violence was the only thing that carried sparks of color to my sightless eyes. 


As I walked I heard fights break out behind bars, couples fighting through open windows, and bitter parents disciplining their children. None of the violence surrounding me provided even a glimpse of relief for my cravings. I saw nothing, but I felt despair. Had I been cut off so soon from this feeling of bliss? I wandered the streets, finding myself in a quiet place where my footsteps echoed against bricks. An alley, in what may have been the worst part of the city. 


I strolled casually, but it felt like my mind was tearing itself apart. *Find it, find something. Anything.* The aching need pounded through all of my senses. Suddenly, it came. 


A flash, the feeling of falling. It was harsh and sharp. Distinct. The sound of a sharp blade cutting through the air, the feeling of wind rushing by your body. Cold, unforgiving, bright, and painful. The taste of something metallic, and violent. The color was shocking, reflective. Like a sword coming down. It was regal though, like fine jewelry. It was beautiful yet deadly. It quickly faded into what I was told was red, not the red of anger, but the one I had seen this morning. The red of blood, harm, and pain. The color gave way to another mixture of new ones. I could hear moans of pain coming from somewhere ahead of me. 


Dull, lifeless. Plain. The feeling of the city on an overcast day. It was dreary, and boring. It was the feeling of an impending storm, and the dusty remains of something abandoned. It mixed with and faded into another. Death, and malice. The feeling of pure evil, or *wrongness.* It was the feeling of a night without stars, loneliness, despair, but more than that. It felt like loss and mourning. It was deep, infinite as space. Bottomless, terrifying, all consuming. It was the feeling of entering a basement alone at night. It was elegance, class, and otherworldly beauty. But it was dangerous, it was an end. The alley became still and silent. 


My cravings were beyond satisfied, I didn't pause to think what I may have just witnessed to receive this overload of visual information. I was sky-high, but my rush was interrupted. 


You better get out of here, or this blade is gonna meet *your* guts next. Tell anyone, and I'll find-- An abrupt pause as the man got closer, Wait, are you blind?


I seem to be, I replied casually, the high from the visual stimulation was keeping my fear from seeping forth. 


Right then, walk away, He chuckled, Nothing to *see* here. 


If my eyes could roll-- I've never known if they did or not-- then they did at that moment. I heard him head back in the direction of his victim, and I quickly turned and left the way I had come. I got extremely lucky. Sure, I couldn't really call the police, what would I say? 


*Yes officer, I'm blind but I think I just witnessed a murder. How? Well I think I saw some colors. Yes sir, I did say that I am blind. No sir, I would not be able to identify the victim, suspect, or location of the crime.* 


I would sound ridiculous, no one would believe me. That's likely part of the reason he let me go. I called a cab to take me back home, I was satisfied for the day. I didn't tell my wife about my adventure through the city, I didn't want her to worry. After she got home from work we spent the evening together, I was entirely happy. 


I woke up yesterday morning in severe pain. My cravings were back and fiercer than ever, my body spasmed. I ended up knocking a lamp off the bedside table during my fit, and a shard from it flew directly into my thigh. I yelped in momentary pain, but the cravings had slightly dulled as a very brief flash of blood-red appeared. It was the smallest flash yet, and it did little to ease my pain. It was enough to get me out of bed. 


The phone beeped, and I checked the message. It was from my wife, I had slept in and she had gone ahead to work. My head was pounding, and as I went to leave the room several sharp fragments of the lamp dug into the soles of my feet. No flashes, no color. I was disappointed, I didn't step on them intentionally, but receiving no flash for the pain felt unfair. It made me curious. 


I picked up a relatively large shard from the ground and sliced across my outer forearm. A miniscule flash. I tried again, nothing. It seemed that everything only worked once. I would need to up the ante if I wanted to get my fix and make the searing pain stop. I got dressed and headed out of the house. Same plan as yesterday, I would roam the dangerous streets until an act of violence brought me color and satisfaction. Hours of wandering proved fruitless, and the pain only grew worse. 


I ended up curling into the fetal position in an alley, the pain was unbearable. I nearly passed out when I heard a gruff, raspy voice from above me. 


Yer in my spot, I suggest you move before I make you. I could smell earth and trash, the man smelled awful. It was clear that he was homeless, and I was having my breakdown in his territory. 


I'm sorry sir, I'm not homeless, I stammered out, the withdrawal was causing violent shivers, I'm sick, I can't see. I live in North York. 


I felt him draw close, and he gripped the front of my jacket. 


Get out of here, before I hurt you. His words came with a rush of new color. It was deep and dark. It brought on visions of a lush forest at night, mysterious plants and trees. The smell of grass and moss, the feeling of being surrounded by nature. But it was so dark, it felt like the depths of an algae infested pond. I felt renewed by the sudden sensation. There was an undertone of the dark, infinite color. I could tell I was in danger. 


Before he could speak another word, I pulled a pocket knife from my jacket and stabbed--well obviously --blindly. The moment the blade hit home there was a flash of color. It was similar to the yellow I had seen before, but this one was brighter, electrifying. It was like sudden lightning before a thunderstorm. I sent the blade into the homeless man over and over. I saw the quick flash of blood red, as well as the metallic color I had seen the day before. Then there was the dreary color that faded into the shade of an infinite abyss. 


He was dead. I felt the incredible rush once again, and hoped I hadn't gotten any blood on me as I happily trotted away from the scene. I could say I was at a butcher shop, no one would expect a blind man of murder. I was ecstatic, but as I worked my way back home I came to a realization. What was more violent than committing a random murder? How would I satisfy my craving for sight tomorrow? I pushed the thought aside, I would deal with it later. 


I changed clothes when I got home, unsure if they were bloodied or not. I stuffed them down the garbage chute and continued my day as though I'd never left the house. I kept my activities a secret again, now positive that telling my wife would convince her I've gone insane. 


My night was normal, but I woke up early this morning to the pain. It's coming faster, and I don't know how to stop it. Maybe just one more fix will end it for good. It hurts so much, I only have one option. I have to listen to the little voice in my head that *screams* for me to do it again. Be more aggressive. 


I feel remorse in advance, I have an addiction. I *can't* stop. I need to *see.* I need more, I think my body will shut down from the withdrawals. You don't understand how painful it is to see a glimpse of something you've been missing your whole life, and then to add to your misery you have to hide not only the pain, but the joy you feel when you find something that heals it. I had to let someone know. I'm not strong enough to resist the cravings. I have to keep doing this. 

I don't know how long I can go without getting caught, but I can't stop yet. I don't know if I ever will.

<TEXT> 

There was a reason our parents warned us away from the woods. A reason they adamantly insisted that the legends weren't true. We assumed it was the usual reason, there might be bad people or wild animals. Those were reasons that you tend to ignore as a child, because *nothing bad ever happens to children.* Back then the news stories seemed so far away, danger was a distant thought, bad things never happened in your home town. 


That was the ideology that sent me and my best friend Henry into the woods that night. We were going to catch the Black Rabbit. According to the urban legend if you caught it, you got a wish. We were quest seekers, little 8 year old adventurers. 


We planned our quest out methodically. We'd leave in the night once our parents were asleep. We'd pack snacks, and nets to catch the rabbit. Henry would pack one of his father's snares. We'd search the woods until we got to the Dead Forest. Then we'd set our traps and wait. 


The Dead Forest was a part deep in the woods, named by the locals. Henry and I had been there many times during the daylight hours, and there was no doubt that it was spooky. You'd be walking through lush, vibrant growth, and suddenly the landscape would change. A graveyard of small animal bones and rotted trees stretched several miles wide. No one knows why it's like that, but legend says that it's the Black Rabbit's domain. 


Around 11pm we met by the edge of the woods. It would be a long walk to the Dead Forest, but it would be worth it. Our friend Samantha had leukemia, and after all her fighting she only had a few months to live. We wanted to make her better, we couldn't imagine a world without her. So we set out to save her. 


Eventually we made it to the Dead Forest and set our traps, and we waited. After a few hours we checked, there was a small black rabbit caught in the trap. 


Henry reached his hand out to it, and suddenly sharp teeth latched onto his hand. As Henry screamed in pain it began to grow. It took on the shape of a man as it grew, the teeth sharpened. 


I watched in awe as is ate Henry's hand, then arm, and then widened its jaws to consume his entire body. When it was done there was nothing left. 


*What is your wish?* It asked in a deep voice. 


You ate my friend, give him back! I screamed. 


*I cannot return the payment you gave. Wishes come with a price.* 


This was *not* supposed to happen to children. I crawled to my feet and ran from the woods without a word. I never went back. 


Somehow Samantha went into remission, it's been twenty years since then and she's still alive. Maybe the unspoken wish came true, but was it really worth the cost?

<TITLE> My Daughter Loves Playing Games With Me </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-12 06:33:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since she was a little girl, Maybelle loved playing Hide N Seek. She was great at it when she was young, she was so tiny. I'd spend hours searching for her, listening for my daughter's soft giggles as she listened to me walk by her hiding place. I didn't have to pretend I didn't know where she was, because I rarely ever did. 


Even when I could hear her laughter I had trouble locating her. She was an expert at the game. She'd hide in the smallest places. Closets, drawers, under beds, the cabinet under the sink, laundry baskets, and even the dryer. Sometimes it would take so long to find her that when I finally did she'd be asleep. So many times I'd carry her thin frame out of a hiding spot and into her bed. 


She'd stir as I tucked her in, Did I win, Daddy? 


You always do, baby. Sweet dreams little May, I'd plant a soft kiss on her forehead and turn on the night light. She was so precious, she made every day of my life happier. 


As she got older, she grew too big to fit comfortably in her hiding places, and she had run out of new places to go in the house. Instead of hiding merely herself she began hiding objects. Sometimes it was like a regular game of Hide N Seek, but other times she'd hide things from my wife so that she couldn't find them. She didn't want to be predictable, she loved winning the game. Some days I'd get home from work and Izzy would be near tears. 


She'd spend hours searching for the things our daughter had hidden, and she grew frustrated with the antics. Izzy and Maybelle weren't getting along very well, and I couldn't place why. My main assumption was that Maybelle wanted her mother's attention. I worked long hours, double shifts just to keep our family afloat. 


I know Izzy has been kind of different and upset since she was let go, but it wasn't fair to Maybelle. She was only seven, she didn't understand that Mommy had lost her job. All she knew was that Mommy was at home all the time now, and she expected that would mean she'd pay more attention. It didn't apparently, Izzy just found herself annoyed at the constant hiding. Usually I was the seeker, Izzy just didn't understand how much our daughter enjoyed outsmarting adults in some way. 


Back when Izzy was still working she'd get home in the afternoon to tired to do much else than cook, so playing Maybelles game was left up to me. I didn't mind it at all. I was tired too but I know the importance of being their for your child, especially when you're not home all the time. Izzy was always preoccupied with other things, she was constantly trying to contact people for job offers, so it was understandable that she couldn't always give Maybelle 100% of her attention. She wasn't really a bad mother, I think she just didn't understand how different life was with a child. 


She had never been at home all day, and last year Maybelle had aged out of her daycare. This was the first time Izzy had ever experienced what it was like to have to spend almost your entire day with a seven year old. She'd only been out of work for a month when I noticed that she was visibly stressed. 


I don't think she was sleeping much, she was constantly irritable and exhausted. That was a small part of the reason we had a huge fight last month. I was out picking up groceries, Izzy was going to watch Maybelle and get dinner started. I texted her to come outside and help bring things in, but heard the notification alert from inside the car. I gave a quick check around and found her phone tucked under the passenger seat, a series of notifications from her old boss and the text from me were listed on the screen. 


I dropped the phone into my jacket pocket and entered the house with arms full of bags. As soon as I shut the door behind me my daughter came crying and barrelled into my legs. 


Mommy tried to *cook* me in the oven! She cried, gripping my legs to the point that I couldn't walk. 


Um, I'm sorry sweetie, what? I didn't want to laugh when she was obviously afraid of something. 


Izzy walked over full of sighs and annoyance, She thinks I tried to cook her in the oven. She keeps calling me a witch,and she's hidden my phone and car keys, Her voice was harsh, and held a hint of a whine. She sounded like a teenager complaining about being picked on. 


Why does she think you tried to cook her? I asked, not because I thought she'd lie but because it was the oddest accusation I'd ever heard. 


She sighed again before explaining, She was playing that stupid game again and I couldn't find her. I figured she'd fallen asleep again, and I went to make dinner. When I set the oven to preheat and opened the stove to make sure nothing was in there, I found her. She's totally fine, the oven wasn't even warm yet. 


I was a little shocked at the nonchalant way she spoke about it. You're annoyed that you could have accidentally killed your daughter? I would have been horrified, I would have apologized for lifetimes for not finding her sooner. Sure, she wasn't hurt in any way, but the *possibility* of it shook me to the core. I found myself angry that she wasn't more careful, and sent Maybelle off to her room to play. 


Go on and play sweetheart, you're okay. Mommy has had a long day, she didn't mean it, I told her reassuringly. 


*Mommy is evil. She does bad things.* She whispered in response before obeying and running off to her room. 


Why wouldn't you just look for her? She could have gotten *hurt* Izzy. I spoke angrily, more upset than the situation really warranted. 


I'm sorry! I did look for her, and all the shit she's been hiding, I wanted to start dinner before you got back and she has *never* hidden in there before. I didn't know. I'm sorry, but she is okay. She looked ready to cry, perhaps my tone had been too harsh. 


I pulled her to me and apologized for being so harsh, I was just worried about our baby. She seemed to understand, and asked if I would help her look for her phone and keys while dinner finished cooking. I pulled her phone out of my pocket and held it out to her. She look surprised. 


You took my phone? She questioned. 


Oh no, I just found it in your car, babe, I turned to look through the couch for her keys. 


She looked quizzically at me and quickly scrolled through her missed messages. 


May must have put it in there before you ran out, She said before joining me in the search. 


I was confused about the way she was acting, but I pushed that aside. We eventually located her keys, they had been in a pocket if a jacket she rarely wore. 


It had been an exhausting day, and we ate a quiet dinner. Afterwards Izzy helped May wash up, and then called me to put her to bed. I started to tuck her in, and she beckoned for me to lean close. 


*Is Mommy gone?* She whispered to me. 


She went to lie down in bed, do you want her? I asked. She shook her head aggressively. 


She wants to hurt me, Daddy. She tried to drown me in the bath. She does bad things. She spoke as though it was a deep dark secret. 


I don't know about that, but I'll talk to her if it'll make you feel better, okay? She smiled and nodded. I gave her a kiss and told her I'd see her tomorrow. 


I meant to ask Izzy what the whole drowning accusation was about, but she was asleep when I went into our bedroom. The day had worn me out, and I needed to get some sleep before leaving for work in the dark hours of the morning. 


Throughout the next few days I would arrive home to complaints about things being hidden, and accusations of attempted murder. I have no idea why Maybelle thought her mother was trying to kill her. Perhaps the oven incident traumatized her, maybe it was an alarming way to cry for attention, but regardless it was wearing on my mind. 


Yesterday was the day I had to leave for good. On my way to work I heard a phone go off in my car, it was Izzys. She was going to be pissed when she woke up and couldn't find it for the other day. I prepared myself to be stressed out. Putting the phone in my pocket ended up being a mistake, it went off almost constantly with notifications. By the time I left in the afternoon I was thoroughly agitated. I got in my car and whipped out her phone, prepared to lay into someone for not being socially intelligent enough to know when their messages are being ignored. 


I was surprised to see that almost every notification was from her old boss. I would have shrugged it off and put the phone away uninterested in looking through his ideas for job openings, but the first message sitting on the home screen turned my annoyance into rage. 


*Babe, why aren't you answering my messages?* 


I ran through their chat history, praying it was a typo. All I found were graphic photos and lurid conversation. My wife for the past 9 years, the girl I've loved since I was 21, was cheating on me. I shoved her phone back in my pocket and drove home in a state of absolute rage. My first thought was that I was I was going to kill them both. 


I got home to find the house silent. Maybelle was still at school. I thought maybe Izzy was napping, and I was prepared to wake her up and make her face what she'd done. She wasn't in the bed though, so I went to search the rest of the house. I found myself reminded of Maybelles games of Hide N Seek. 


Maybe thinking of her was what made me check her bedroom. As I entered I nearly slipped and fell face first. There was a pool of blood covering the floor, and there she was with several deep wounds in her stomach. My rage dissipated in favor of despair. 


Izzy? I tried to shake her awake, but she had obviously been dead for hours. I ran out of the room sick to my stomach. I didn't know what to do. Obviously if the police asked for her phone, or questioned her friends or old employer, it would come out that she was cheating. I would be the main suspect. No signs of a break in, my footprints in the blood. I would go to jail and never see my daughter again. 


It was true that I had brief thoughts of a bloody murder on my mind, but this wasn't my doing. So I ran. I drove and picked up Maybelle from school, and we left the state. I was planning to make our way out of the country, maybe they'd find Izzys killer and I could come back. I couldn't stay and let them arrest me because I seemed guilty, I couldn't lose my daughter. 


Last night after May and I got to the hotel and she settled down to watch some cartoons on TV, I decided to look through Izzy's phone. More to remember the good times than search for more bad. I opened up our conversation and saw that several messages has failed to send to me for some reason. They were all similar. 


*There is something really wrong with Maybelle.*


*Baby, I'm afraid of our daughter.*


*She's scaring me. Every time we're alone she says that you're going to hurt me or she'll do it for you.*


*Why won't these messages send??? Everything else does. OUR DAUGHTER IS CRAZY.*


*This is why she's doing it. Hiding and getting into dangerous situations, saying that I'm trying to kill her. She's trying to get rid of me.* 


*Why does our daughter hate me?*


I was shocked to find them. I didn't know what to think, but I thought maybe I could figure out the reason she claimed her mother tried to kill her so many times. 


May, honey? I turned off the TV, I have to talk to you about Mommy,


Don't worry Daddy, I took care of her. She said with a smile, like I should be proud. 


You did? 


Mhmm, She giggled I played Hide N Seek with a knife and her belly! 


Oh, sweetheart that's not okay I started. 

What? She got teary eyed, Daddy I just wanted to help, she was doing bad things.


Oh baby, don't cry. I know, I hugged her because I didn't know what else to do. 


You'll still play games with me right? If you do then I promise I won't play the bad kind with you, okay deal? She looked up at me, almost smirking. Suddenly I was afraid. 


I agreed with her, and tucked her into bed. It's the next morning now, and I'm afraid. I'm afraid of a seven year old girl. I don't know what to do about her, but something about the way she looked at me while we were eating breakfast felt *inhuman*. She's my daughter and I love her, but I'm not even sure if she's really my daughter on the inside. 


I have to get going now, we're going to play Hide N Seek across the country, while I pray that I don't end up like my wife.

<TEXT> This is amazing advice, I'll search around in the morning to see if there are any Pics remaining, and whether or not there are I'll find out as much as I can about their cure progress, or the progress with identifying the unknown substance. If I can't get in, or I can't find their samples, I'll head to the south woods before I leave and take mushrooms from around there, hopefully they have the mutation. 

I'll print out a copy of this, and add any updates to the end of this post. I'll try as hard as I can for as long as I'm able to help end this before it spreads.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Suicide Town (Part 2) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-10 23:36:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The first part of the journey leading up to the last month of my life can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5yi7eo/suicide_town/)


We started calling the monthly deaths *Waves.* I suppose it was a way to make it sound better. Rather than just bluntly stating that on the 9th of every month there would be mass suicides, there would be a *Wave.* The reality didn't set in until the second one. Sure, everyone had panicked during the first *Wave*, but it didn't compare to the level of fear that came with realizing it wasn't a one time thing. 


I was staying with Charlotte when the 9th of May hit. Her parents had gone out to get groceries, and besides the quarantine and the issues it caused, life was relatively normal. When her parents got home we heard the news, it was happening again. People all over town were committing suicide. 


There were crashed cars everywhere, bodies hanging in the street, people in stores picking up anything sharp enough to pierce flesh. It was the same scene as a month ago, but on a larger scale. Charlotte's mother was shaken, and she gripped her husband fiercely. They had been in a checkout line when the cashier wrapped a phone cord around his neck. 


Try as anyone might have to stop these people from harming themselves, they were unsuccessful. Another wave of mass hysteria and panic ensued. The news channel was down for the entire day. We had no way of knowing how severe this *Wave* was. 


I tried calling Erin's house to see if they had seen or heard anything about the deaths, but there was no answer. In the back of my mind I knew their family had been part of the people who were affected. We stayed in the house all day, not wanting to become collateral damage during someone's suicide attempt. 


By the next morning the news channel was up and running again, but not by anyone from town. The doctors and scientists who had been called in to find out what was going on now ran everything. They were finally ready to tell us what was going on. 


During the search for the mushrooms that Janice Bergman wrote about in her note, they had found some interesting things. First, was that there was only one type of mushroom growing in the woods around our town. *Boletus badius.* It wasn't a harmful mushroom, it was normally safe and edible. They collected soil samples, and several of the mushrooms from various locations in the woods to examine. 


According to their findings, something in the soil had absorbed into the mushrooms and caused some sort of mutation. The substance in the soil was not identifiable, they had no clues as to what it may be, or where it may have come from. They believe it is the source of the sickness that has infected our town. It's been nicknamed the B-virus. 


Additionally, they told us the specifics of the B-virus. Exactly one month after exposure an irresistible compulsion to end your life occurs. Immediately following death microscopic spores are released into the surrounding air, infecting anyone within 500 feet of the deceased. It is believed that the spores dissipate or are absorbed into hosts within ten minutes following the death. 


The new information on the B-virus heightened the panic and despair that already weighed heavily on the town. According to what we were told, the total deaths since patient zero were around 800. Nearly half the town, not including all the people who had been newly infected the day prior. Janice Bergman had started something that no one knew how to stop. They couldn't even begin to work on a cure because they couldn't identify the substance that poisoned the mushrooms. 


A sense of impending doom filled us all, and we began to truly live everyday like it was our last. All we could do was pretend like we could still live normally until the days when a *Wave* would hit us. We tried to make light of a dark situation, we nicknamed the scientists and doctors the Pics. People in charge. That was around the time we started calling the deaths *Waves*. 


The Pics brought in food from the outside, they kept our power and water going. We lived for free during that time, considering many of the adults in town had jobs a great distance away. They didn't let us die in any way that they could prevent. As far as we knew the Pics were working around the clock to see if they could find a cure for us. 


The day before the third *Wave* hit Charlotte's parents left. They told us to take care of each other and the house. They knew they were about to die. It was a miserable time, and when the third *Wave* rolled through, the town suffered its greatest loss yet. Another near 800 deaths occurred, doubling the already daunting total. Over three quarters of the town was wiped out in just three months. 


After that each wave provided less and less death, we were aware of the B-virus and we were aware of how to avoid catching it. Some people let themselves be exposed when a *Wave* hit. They didn't want to let their loved ones go alone, or they didn't want to stay in the forsaken town. People went crazy. By the 9th month we were down to just over a hundred people. Somehow staying hidden in Charlotte's house had kept us safe. We coined a new term by then, the Hopeless. 


The Hopeless were people who didn't give a shit if they got exposed, and went for maximum impact when it was time for a *Wave.* They were sad, they were vengeful, and they were the main reason that the B-virus didn't die out. They included the people who stayed with lived ones when their *Wave* hit. We all could have stayed hidden, but the cynical Hopeless wanted payback. They had lost everyone, and sought to bring the Pics and everyone else in the town the same pain. 


Only a few new people became infected with each new *Wave* now, and most of those infections were because of the Hopeless. They broke into houses and chased people down to ensure that their misery would live on. It was the darkest time in our lives. The following two months brought our population down to around 75. We were almost dead. About two weeks before we hit the eleventh month, we learned something new about the virus. 


If you died before your month had passed, you still contained more than enough spores to infect other people. We never realized this before due to the extravagant amount of deaths and infections. Food deliveries were sabotaged by the Hopeless, and many of the Pics became infected. To put it short, we were all fucked. At any moment someone could die and infect you,it was no longer confined to one day a month when we needed to hide, it was everyday. 


As of a week ago the town seems to have gone silent. I thought that maybe Charlotte and I were the last alive. I thought we might have beat it, and that we could be free and leave this place forever, but apparently that's not what fate wanted. 


Two days ago Charlotte came to me stone faced. She handed me a piece of paper, and didn't say a word. 


*I know it's too late, and I'm so sorry I didn't tell you. I didn't want to be left alone when it happened. One of the Hopeless got me last month when I went to the food delivery. I wanted to spend all of my leftover time with you. I'm sorry for being so selfish, I love you Annalyn Morrison. I'm so sorry.*


*- Charlotte*


I looked up at her in confusion, realizing too late that the note had been a distraction as well as a goodbye. Before I could get a word out, or even attempt to stop her, she plunged a kitchen knife deep into her throat. My end was set in stone. I kicked myself for not noticing the knife sooner. 


I don't have a lot of time left, and I don't want to spend the last month of my life stuck in this caged town. I'm not sure if there are any Pics left, or if the B-virus took them all. I hope this ends here, and I hope the virus doesn't drive me crazy enough to become one of the Hopeless. If the Pics are really gone, I can say that won't mean well for the rest of you. 


I'm just going to try to handle my last month in stride. My only advice to you is to not eat any wild mushrooms, even if they should be safe. And if you happen to be nearby when someone commits a public suicide, be wary, it may have gotten out. 


I'm so sorry to admit that I plan on leaving this town if I can. I want to live to the fullest, and if I'm sane at the end, I'll go somewhere where no one is close enough to get hurt.

<TEXT> Janice Bergman was a nice girl, she was smart, decently pretty, and had the voice of an angel. I had heard her when she was rehearsing for the talent show. That was during my senior year of highschool, exactly one year ago now. She was the reason this all started. I think I could be the one it ends with. Someone has to know what happened here. 


I remember the day it all began well, partially because I was late. Late for seemingly everything. It was March, and on the drive to school my car had gotten stuck in the remaining muddy snow. That just seemed to set off a chain throughout the day, forgotten notebooks, things left in my car, locker stuck shut. Anything that could go wrong did, even after the school day ended. When it was time for the talent show at 6pm I *was* on time, but then realized I had to drive all the way back home to get my guitar. I wasn't surprised that I showed back up after the show had begun. However, I *was* surprised at the scene when I got there. 


There were police cars, and an ambulance. Half the school was standing on the front lawn, and more people were driving up at the same time as me. I got out of my car, unsure of what was happening. That's when my girlfriend came running from the crowd. 


Ohmygod, Anna! She sounded panicked. 


Charlotte? What's going on? I was still trying to take in the scene, a body was being taken to the ambulance. A red stain on a white sheet, Who the fuck is dead? 


She started crying, I don't know what happened, I was waiting here for you. Erin is panicking, she said that everyone watched Janice die! I pulled her into me as her sobs increased. I almost joined her, but I was still so confused. 


Erin and David came over at that moment, arms draped around each other's waists. Erin looked shaken. David looked ready to explode with words. They were my friends, but they weren't top shelf citizens. Erin spoke first, nearly screaming. 


Janice fucking killed herself! On stage, in front of everyone! She pressed herself closer to David, as if he could shield her from what they witnessed. 


What.. What the fuck? Are you serious, why? I had no idea how to react. I was silently relieved that I had arrived late. 


David confirmed what she said, and offered to show me a video he had taken. I was disgusted by the thought of watching it, and the fact that he kept the recording. 


Why wouldn't you delete that? I questioned, feeling sick over the entire situation. 


I was just going to record it for Erin, she was in the bathroom when Janice went up to sing. I wasn't expecting her to blow her fucking head off, He replied defensively. 


I was suddenly exhausted, by the conversation, the panic surrounding me, and the tragic death that had taken place that night. I pulled Charlotte away from the scene and we drove back to her house. When we arrived I got a text from my dad, he was actually happy that I had been late. He came to watch me play, but ended up only witnessing the gruesome scene. I told him I was with Charlotte, and he thought it was a good idea to stay the night with her. 


We spent that entire night distracting each other, and periodically checking the news to see if any answers were given about what happened. Nothing substantial turned up. No one knew why Janice would do it, she was always happy. Everyone liked her. No one could understand. 


In the following weeks rumours began circulating about a note, but it wasn't released to the public. Our town was relatively small, less than two thousand people. We didn't have access to a huge police force, or a big hospital, I'm not even sure if there was a psychiatrist anywhere around. Who could have known Janice would do this? We weren't equipped for that type of thing. The investigation was open and shut, she committed a public suicide to create maximum impact. We all tried to move on, and we were doing mostly okay. That is, until exactly one month after Janices death. 


Erin called me freaking out. The police were on their way, and David was dead. I could hardly understand her through her screaming sobs, and decided to just pick up Charlotte and go see her in person. She was a mess by the time we got there, and the police were leaving with the body. She took us to her room, where we helped remove the bloody sheets from her bed as we talked. 


Are you okay? Charlotte asked her. 


Do I fucking look okay? He shoved a fucking pencil into his eye while he was on top of me! She screamed, I suddenly realized that she was splattered with blood. 


Wait what? I don't know why my mind wanted more information, maybe it was shock. It took her a moment to collect herself before she explained. 


We were studying, and we took a break. So we were making out on my bed and.. She started crying again, He picked up a pencil from the end table and just fucking stabbed it into his eye! 


I didn't know how to react, so I just hugged her. I had no idea what to say, there was nothing in my seventeen year old repertoire about how to console a girl who just got a very personal insight on suicide. 


A few minutes later Erins mom called for us to come downstairs. We entered the living room to find the local news blaring. 


*... So far there have been over a hundred reported suicides today. Local authorities are unsure what may have caused this, and have said that they will be contacting other law enforcement services. This a tragic day in our own town, just one month after the jarring suicide of local high school senior Janice Bergman. In--*


The anchorman stopped mid sentence, causing the lady next to him to stare. He stayed completely still for a moment, then abruptly pulled out a pocket knife and gave a quick slice across his throat. 


*Turn the cameras off! Call the po--*


The woman was cut off as the automated message from the station appeared. *We're experiencing technical difficulties. Please remain patient while we tend to the issue.* Technical difficulties? I guess a lived aired suicide could fall into that category. A feeling of panic overcame the room. 


The whole town is going to shit, Erin's father proclaimed from his seat on the couch. He followed that up with flipping the channel to a sitcom. 


We retreated back upstairs, and Charlotte and I decided to spend the night with Erin, she was really fucked up over the situation. Understandable, I think we all were. The panicked feeling in the house had not dissipated, and I suspect the entire town was feeling the same. I shot a text out to my dad, letting him know that I was staying over. The three of us ended up cuddling together in Erin's bed, talking about anything that could distract us from what had happened today. We all ended up passing out as the hours dragged by, ignoring the fact that we were lying in the spot where David had died earlier that day. 


I awoke in the morning to find myself alone with Charlotte in the bed. I was tempted to wake her up playfully, but when the daze of sleep faded I recalled the events from the prior day. I could hear the news was back on downstairs, so I shook Charlotte awake to come see what had developed. Erin was already down there staring at the TV. 


What's going on, where did your parents go? I asked Erin when we found her. 


To check the exits. They're closing us in. They think we might be sick. She replied, she looked entirely lost, We're all gonna die in here. 


I gripped her shoulders tightly, trying to understand, What are you talking about?


Anna hey, Charlotte suddenly spoke up, The news has new information. It's back on. 


So rather than grill Erin for more information while she was looking like a deer in the headlights, I sat down with Charlotte. 


*... Sorry to inform the residents that the town is being quarantined. Due to the nature of the deaths, and the severity of the issue, medical professionals believe that we may be suffering from some sort of infection. At this time specifics are unknown, we will be releasing as much as we can and remain on the air as long as possible. It has been asked that we do not speak to anyone outside the town about the sickness and quarantine--*


Turn that shit off, Erin's dad came lumbering in through the front door. 


He immediately went upstairs, and the three of us girls sat on the couch in silence for a moment. Erin's mother came in next, she apologized for her husband's outburst and told us everything we needed to know. In the last 24 hours around two hundred people killed themselves. The local police have brought in specialists to find out what's going on. The doctors who were called in examined a few of the bodies, but didn't share what exactly they've found so far. They suggested to close off the town, whatever is happening might be infectious and they don't want it getting out. 


Due to the fact that we were nearly an hours drive from the next town over, we are the only place affected. So far everyone who has died was confirmed as a witness to Janices suicide last month. We're allowed to talk to people outside of the town, but if we mention the quarantine and incidents going on, our connection will be taken away on an individual basis. They don't want us causing a national panic, but they don't want us to feel like we're cut off. That's all she could find out right now, the authorities haven't released any more information. 


I felt as shocked as Erin had looked this morning. I held Charlotte's hand tightly, the feeling of panic renewed and aggressively bubbled in my chest. 


I need to call my dad, I felt sick as I said the words. Erin's mom gave me a look that felt like pity. 


There was no answer at first, but finally someone picked up the phone. My sigh of relief caught in my throat as I realized the man on the other end of the line was not my father. 


Yes hello, I'm sorry, do you know Mr he paused as he searched for something, Morrison? 


I'm his daughter, I nearly whispered, knowing what was about to come. 


I'm sorry Maam, his body was found in his home a few hours ago. He is being processed at the walk-in clinic. Could you come down here? 


I said I would and hung up. I had no idea who the guy on the phone was, and I found myself angry that anyone would pick up a call on a dead man's phone. Erin's mom offered to drive me there since I wasn't in a good state, and explained on the way that since we had no other medical facility, all the bodies were taken to the clinic. 


My last memory of seeing my father would be him lying on a table, with a broken and bruised neck. The only time I ever went home after that day was to collect clothes and pictures. I didn't want to be in the place where he died. 


In the following days we'd find that Janice did leave a note, as well as a few of the other people who died. I suppose they were the strong ones. The doctors went crazy over her note, and it ended up leaked to the public. 


*I can feel that my time is almost up, I should tell someone what happened before something bad happens to me.* 


*I went into the woods and picked some mushrooms, I knew they weren't the poisonous kind. I don't know enough about drugs, but I figured they had to be edible or that they'd make me hallucinate. I wanted to see what it would be like. I could feel that something was wrong as soon as I ate it. Now that feeling is back, and I know everything is going to go wrong.*


*I'm so sorry, I thought they were okay.*


*-J.B*


All the other notes were nearly the same as one another:


*Help me, it's inside of me. I need to get it out. Something is very wrong. There isn't much time.* 


I think this renewed the feeling of panic that we had become accustomed to, and people were outraged. What was this mushroom? Is it making us sick? All anyone knew for sure was that they were scared. People tried to leave, but the electric fence that had been erected around town kept them in. Someone tried to drive a car through the fence, but it was stronger than that. 


We were trapped. We were scared. We panicked. People died in riots on the street, riots at the gates into town. Some of the researchers who came to search the woods to find and examine the mushrooms were attacked or murdered. Everyone was acting crazy, half the town lost their rights to communicate with the outside world. The rest of us lied about having access to the outside, and we hid. 


We were in a full state of widespread panic by the time the second *Wave* began.

<TITLE> She Is My Eternal Inspiration </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-08 23:00:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Cassandra was a beautiful woman. I swear to the Muses that it was love at first sight. When I first caught a glance at her I was stopped dead in my tracks. Long, flowing, chestnut colored hair, vibrant green eyes, beautiful olive toned skin that was flecked with beauty marks. Classic Italian beauty. Absolutely gorgeous. I must have looked a fool as I stood stricken still on the sidewalk. I had to pick my jaw up from the cement before I could continue on my way to work, and by that time her graceful stride had taken her into a photography studio. I'm no writer, but this woman inspired me to pour out my affections. 


I saw her from time to time over the next few weeks, always on the busy street. In and out of clothing stores, makeup and photography studios, and taxis. She was a busy woman, socializing and working her way to the top. She was in the right place, this part of the city was model central, and she was more than average model material. Her delicate curves were perfectly shaped for everything she wore, I wouldn't be surprised if she hit super model status within the year. That type of beauty is incomparable. 


I longed for the day when Cassandra might come into my studio. If she remained as well kept as I'd always seen her, then applying her makeup would be effortless. In fact, she'd hardly need any. I painted on beautiful faces for others, all the while wishing I would get the opportunity to have my tools touch her skin. It was a selfish thought, but her face plagued my mind. I was under a spell, and I'd never even spoken to her. 


I watched her for months. She often modeled at a studio not far from where I worked, and I would see her walking by my own workplace often. I ached to go talk to her, to tell her how she had become my inspiration. I began painting on canvas, just so that I could have a clean slate. As much as I tried to bring out the same beauty in my clients, none of them measured up to Cassandra. A blank slate was the only place where I could recreate her image to near perfection. 


I'd sigh at myself, embarrassed at my feelings for a woman who likely didn't know I existed. My apartment walls became adorned with those paintings, I saw her more each day. I decided that I should work up the courage to speak to her, rather than just remain a watcher from afar. I was terrified though, I was just a lowly artist and she was quickly becoming a high status model. I didn't want her to think I was just some fan that fawned over her pictures in magazines. I had to at least try though. 


I planned to casually run into her on the street after work one of these days, I knew that even if she wasn't walking somewhere as soon as I left that she would be eventually. I was more than willing to wait. I didn't have to though, she was brought into my workplace that day. I was shocked, I hadn't seen her around in the last few days and didn't expect this to be the place she'd pop up. After speaking with my boss she was brought to me for preparation. I was informed that she had been in a car accident, and some of the signs were obvious. 


She'd need her injuries covered up so that she'd look good for her appearance. I was elated to have the chance to work on her, even the bruises didn't ruin her beauty. I tried to strike up casual conversation but she was silent. I'm used to quiet clients though, so I wasn't offended. I regretted not trying to talk to her on the street before now, I had planned on getting her to come in here myself. Can't dwell on missed opportunities though, she was here regardless. 


By the time I was finished she looked exactly as she always had. I felt a little sad that this would be the last time I'd ever see her in person. She was still so beautiful, eternally so. I was proud of my work on her, I studied her so well before she came in that I had mastered creating this appearance. You could almost believe she wasn't a corpse. She'll look beautiful at her funeral.

<TITLE> I Tried Out a Dating Site </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-08 00:49:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I first met Jackson I was stricken by his eyes. I say met, but we didn't *actually* meet that day. I found him on a dating site named something I'd be ashamed to admit having a profile on. He was a gorgeous human being, so of course I was cautious. I've seen Catfish, I know that online dating can be sketchy. 


I figured I was smart enough to not get screwed over. After we had talked a few times and he had given me some basic information, I dug as deep as I could online.


Every social media platform related to Jackson, I found. The phone I had been texting was in his name, and every picture he posted was only associated with his own accounts. By all means this guy was real, and he was interested in *me.* 


He was so similar to me. An only child with parents that we couldn't stand. We bonded over stories of lackluster childhoods. 


After nearly two months of talking online we decided to close the distance. My job provided me with the opportunity to travel different places when I wanted to do business, and it just so happened that Jackson lived in the city I'd be headed to next. Before I left on my trip, he confided in me that he hadn't told any of his friends that he started a relationship online. He was embarrassed. I was a little hurt. 


I had told my family about him. He was quite the catch, something I'd been looking for for a long time. I got over it though, it didn't matter if his friends knew about me. In fact, it'd be better off in case things went awry. I didn't need him running off and saying that I was crazy if it didn't work out. 


When I spotted him in the bar we'd picked for our first meeting I checked over the screenshots in my phone from when I was running my check, definitely the right guy. I tucked it into my purse, leaving the mugshot and details of his arrest open. We'd need to address that. 


We hit it off amazingly, and left the bar tipsy and in need of a bed. The walk to his apartment led us through a dark alley, where he stopped to kiss me. I pushed him off and held up my phone.


So, you're into kiddie porn? Wouldn't expect that from someone so attractive. I smiled a sharp grin as he gaped in shock and confusion. Before he could deny it, I lunged. My shark teeth sunk into his jugular. As he choked out his last breaths, I spit the blood in my mouth onto the ground. 


I had no desire to eat him, evil tastes vile. I was thankful for the nearby river, I was able to dump the body and collect his soul at the same time. 


Be careful who you meet online, that guy was bad news.

<TEXT> After leaving Sherri's house my first instinct was to make sure Kevin was still at home and in bed. I was weary by the time I got home, but thankful to find Kevin snoring in his bed. I wanted to immediately look into more information about what I was dealing with, but I had no idea where to start. My brain was fried and I needed to sleep before I could dig deeper. 


I panicked when I woke up in the morning, the bliss of my slumber giving way to the revelations of last night. I still wasn't sure where to begin, but I thought my safest bet was to start with my husband. As soon as Kevin left to catch the school bus I told Jeremy all about my conversation with Sherri, and what we thought was happening with Kevin. He laughed at first, thinking it was a joke. 


Are you sure Sherri hasn't gone nuts? He had asked with a grin. Noticing that my demeanor remained serious he collected himself, Alright, so what are we supposed to do about this? His face shifted to a look of concern, and I could only imagine that believing in what I was telling him tested every ounce of the psychiatrist he was. 


I'm not sure, but maybe you know someone who could help? If this is something that's being passed around there has to be some kind of record, right? I can't imagine that no one has ever seen a psychiatrist about an issue like this. I told him, unsure if I was asking the right questions. It seemed only logical that if you had a child with these kinds of issues that you'd seek out professional help. 


I don't know if I can find that kind of information, babe, He gave me another worried glance, as though this revelation may break my heart, If it's not been discussed before, any information about specific patients with this kind of issue will be confidential. 


Well I figured that, but there must be *someone* who thought it was an extremely unusual case and sought out help. Or maybe someone who's seen it several times and decided to look further into it, or document it? I had not been confident broaching the subject in the first place, and my lack of in-depth psychiatric knowledge seemed more apparent as he tried to convince me not to get my hopes up. 


He squeezed my shoulder reassuringly, If there's been a case study, or it's in any medical journal, I'll do whatever I can to find the documentation. 


I nearly cried with relief, even if there was nothing to find I was still elated that I had someone to help. My hopes were definitely held high. I had one final question, Hun How hard do you think it would be to find a patient who was admitted to an institution? 


Still in one? I think you'd have to find the person who admitted them, I don't exactly have a list of every patient who has ever been admitted, and I couldn't give you that information if I did.


His answer satisfied me, and I kissed him goodbye so that he could leave for work. I had my own work to do. With the house to myself for the day I began to scour the internet for information about the Morton family. Local information came first, the news articles about the tragic fire. Looking through the online archive of the newspaper, I saw that they also ran a few other stories on the Mortons. *Local Girl Murders Sister* one of the headlines read.


I skimmed over the articles, they only confirmed what I had already been told. I glanced through older news for a minute until a headline from a few months prior to the fire caught my attention. *Child Still Missing*. The first line stood out, *Police are still searching for the boy who went missing in the middle of the night from a local foster home*. I was about to read more into it when my phone rang. My heart sank as I heard the voice on the line.


The principal of Kevin's school sounded mortified as he spoke, There's been an incident concerning Kevin, we're going to need both you and your husband to report to the school immediately. I looked at the clock, he'd only been gone less than three hours. What could he have done? 


I'm on my way, I felt sick to my stomach as the call ended. I immediately dialed Jeremy as I collected my purse and keys. 


Hey Jere, there's a problem with Kevin. They need us at the school right now, I said. 


Um, yea. I'll head right out, He sounded confused and distracted. 


You okay, hun? I was concerned, I didn't know how well I could handle it if something else was wrong right now. 


He cleared his throat, Ah, yea. I was able to find out about a doctor from some colleagues, but I have to tell you in person. It's not much yet. He still sounded odd, but I didn't have the time to question him right then. 


Okay well, I'll see you at the school. Love you, I was confused about the way he had been speaking, but now wasn't the time to dwell on it. I needed to see what on earth could have happened at the school. As I drove the thoughts all plagued me at once. *Article, school incident, fire, Morton family, doctor.* My search for answers about Kevin was pulling up so many new questions.

<TEXT> I'm not sure if she was really crazy, or if the voices were real. I assumed my mother was merely driven crazy by the constant abuse and noise. It could have another source though, her method of ending things was *incredibly* over the top. 

I'll probably be getting speach therapy eventually, but I'm afraid to speak again. 

I know writing this was a risk because my mother may see it, but I needed to get it off of my chest. Perhaps I'll just reveal my story on here to the therapist when I go again. Our meetings so far have been more silent than you'd even expect.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> You Don't Do That To Family </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Grandma started to lose her mind as she aged, and Mother thought it would be wise to take her into our home. She thought it might slow the progression, or at least keep her comfortable until her mind was emptied of every last one of it's marbles. Grandma was always a strict, bitter, and admittedly terrifying woman. She was well respected, but also feared. No one dared stand up to her, even as she started insisting that her delusions and hallucinations were true. We went along with it, but we also anxiously awaited the day that the 90 year old would pass. 


Myself being nearly twenty five meant that I did the majority of the housework to pay my dues, and Grandma was strict about it. Dad's been gone my entire life, I had no other siblings, and an ectopic pregnancy ruined my chances at having my own family and tore apart my fragile relationship. These two women are all I've got, and I needed them when I was alone and my mind slunk into dark places. Living with my mother wasn't the most desirable thing, but since my loss I haven't been able to function at 100%. Mom could use the help anyways, living alone can be depressing. 


I had been back home for a month when Grandma had come to stay with us. She wasn't quite as crazy when she first got there, just constantly mumbling about voices. I wasn't ecstatic about housing and caring for a mad woman, but I figured it could be worse. I thought it would be something else to take my mind off of constant dark thoughts, but she ended up being a black hole. After a few weeks of staying with us her condition was becoming noticeably worse. Her mumbling turned to shouting, and she began insisting the things she saw and heard were real. 


We had to play along or risk facing a violent outburst. She'd throw anything close enough to grab, and it fucking hurt if you were in the way of whatever she was throwing. We were nearly two months into this hell when she got my mother across the chest with a plate. It cut her deeply, and she had to go to the hospital for stitches. Grandma had always been a bitter woman, but this illness was bringing it to new levels. Mom refused to tell anyone outside the family how she really got the injury, and you could tell the secret was eating her up inside. She followed the one most important rule: You don't do that to family. Which meant, you *never* admit to someone outside the family that someone inside did something wrong. It was a rule that had been heavily enforced for generations. 


After that incident the situation in the house got very tense, and it made me wish I could get my shit together enough to leave. I'd feel awful leaving my mother alone with Grandma though.


Another month and things were intolerable. The house was a constant cascade of noises, TVs, radios, and loud uncomfortable voices filled any silence. Silence was no longer allowed. Partaking in the delusions meant more than just patting the old woman on the shoulder and saying, Yes, I hear it too. We had to help her block out the voices, or face her wrath. I honestly couldn't understand why my mother wouldn't just put her in a home.


I'd asked her, and every time she gave the same reply, You don't do that to family. 


I can understand the sentiment, I couldn't imagine how I'd feel if I had a child who sent me away to die in a false paradise. Old age homes are depressing, I've never met someone with any happy stories about sending a family member to one. Now, Grandma would be a different case. She didn't really deserve the amount of kindness we afforded her, but it wasn't entirely her fault. Sure she was a bitch before she went crazy, but it wasn't nearly as bad. 


The constant noise was enough to drive you up the wall, and I ended up finally using my prescription for sleeping pills. Along with the antidepressants I'd already been taking they helped enough to bring living there to a level only slightly below intolerable. It was okay, at least I could sleep through the noise. Mom didn't get the luxury of taking pills to shut it out, though she tried. The sleeping pills didn't work well enough for her, and the blaring radio coming from Grandma's room kept her up nearly every night. 


I think her true breaking point was about a month and a half ago. We were sitting down for dinner together, both the tv and radio were screaming the news from the living room. I could tell she was agitated, but I didn't realize how much until she got up and unplugged everything. The house fell into a moment of silence before Grandma started screaming. 


Laura, Laura! Why are you letting them take me! *Why?!* She shrieked, grasping her head in both hands. After another quiet moment she looked to me instead, Mary, sweet child, don't let her do this to me. God, make it stop! *MAKE IT STOP!* I recoiled as her voice raised, unsure of what to do. 


Grandma it's okay, please--


Shut the *fuck* up. Is it so hard to just have a minute of quiet? My mother cut me off with a glare. 


I was shocked, to say the least. I didn't understand why she was suddenly and so aggressively deciding to stop playing into Grandma's delusions. I didn't have time to ask her either, because that was the moment when a butter knife flew across the table. The heavy metal handle her hit her just above her temple, and the blood was immediate. She was pissed, but in a terrifyingly calm way. She touched her fingers to the wound, looked at the blood, and smiled. 


You fucking *bitch,* She said in a low voice, I care for you, take you into my home, put up with your bullshit, and when we don't play along for thirty seconds you hurt us? 


Grandma looked a little shocked but resumed her yelling, They're going to take me, they took my baby! Look how she disobeys me, she's handing me to the voices!


Mother shook her head and walked away from the table, and I did the only thing I thought would help. I started a random conversation with Grandma, something to distract her from her screaming and give my mom a chance to calm down and relax. It wasn't very helpful, I wasn't loud enough to block out the false voices in Grandma's head. I ended up sitting her in front of the TV and putting the news back on at a disgustingly loud volume. I went to find my mom and ask her if she was okay. She was in the bathroom tending to her wound. 


Are you going to the hospital?


Did you really turn that damn TV back on? She replied without looking at me. 


Um.. Yea. I figured it was better than the screaming..


I'm not going anywhere, someone will wonder why I've needed stitches twice in as many months. We don't talk about this kind of thing with other people. You don't do that to family. Oh, and stop making noise. I have a migraine and I'm going to lose it on someone if I hear another sound for the rest of the day. She pushed past me and walked away, leaving me conflicted. 

I spent the rest of the day trying to deal with the screaming, and when I could no longer take it I decided I needed to calm Grandma down. Mom had gotten so pissed off that she had moved the TV and radio from the living room into her own bedroom and closed herself in with them. There was only screaming to be heard in the house. I spent hours trying to talk Grandma out of it, but it only calmed her slightly. When mom finally came out of the room she looked exhausted. 


Didn't I tell you to shut up? She sighed. I felt bad for disobeying, but I didn't know how else to deal with it. You want tea Mary? Im gonna make us all some tea so we can forget about this stressful day. 


I nodded, wanting to avoid her freaking out again. We all sat and drank the tea, while Mom sang loudly to avoid the screaming. It was almost a peaceful moment. I checked the time after we finished and it was getting late, so I helped Grandma up the stairs and into bed. I turned on her bedside radio, and she was asleep within a few minutes. Relative peace at last. The day had exhausted me. I called a goodnight down the stairs to mom, and went into my own room. I couldn't immediately find my sleeping pills, but I was so exhausted that I didn't bother searching. I'd sleep fine without taking one. 


I slept better than I had in months, it was deep and peaceful and when I finally woke up I wished I could have stayed asleep forever. It was still dark, I was groggy and in a great amount of pain. I brought my hand to my face and I could feel that something was very, very wrong. I ran to the bathroom and caught sight of myself in the mirror, and my mouth bled as it attempted to open and vomit. I choked it down and cried silent tears. My mouth was sewn shut. Somehow through my shock I noticed an empty pill bottle in the sink, my sleeping pills. I had refilled the prescription only two days ago, meaning that nearly thirty pills had been used. I felt sick as I realized what my mother had done. 


I ran to Grandma's room next, and found her in the same mutilated state as I was. Only, she was also cold to the touch. I fought the urge to vomit again, and left the room. She either overdosed or asphyxiated and I wasn't trained to tell which was the case with her mouth sewn. I couldn't find my mother anywhere in the house, and when I pulled out my phone I realized that she could be anywhere right now. I had slept for nearly two days. No wonder I didn't wake up while being mutilated, I was nearly comatose. 


I wanted to call the police, but as I was about to dial I kicked myself internally. *You can't talk, stupid.* I walked my sorry ass to the nearest hospital, not wanting to traumatize anyone on the way. My car was missing, so I guess that's what mom used. The hospital staff nearly shit themselves when I walked into the emergency room, it was *almost* funny. 


This entire part if my journey is fairly boring, except for when they realized that behind my sewn lips I had no tongue. They replaced it, but I haven't learned how to speak again yet. I'm scared to talk ever again. The police came to question me about what happened, but I only wrote down that I couldn't remember. Obviously my mother was a suspect, they had found Grandma's body in her house. I know it seems messed up that I wouldn't directly admit what my mother did, but I have three very good reasons for that. 


1. She was already the only suspect. 


2. I was afraid she'd find me and punish me again for speaking when I shouldn't. 


3. You don't do that to family.

<TEXT> Well, his behavior towards animals suggested that he would be an unmotivated killer, harming others with no reason or rhyme. I was more worried that he would go out into the world and become an obvious threat, rather than being a good heir to my legacy, an investigation into him could have potentially been brought too close to home, sinking myself along with him. 

Being wary of his actions was necessary, he was far too public with his behavior, thinking only of hurting one person and not of who would *see* him doing this harm. Reckless. 

Amanda though, she's on the right track. No one would ever look into her.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> In a Dying World, The List of Things I'll Never do Again is Growing Each Day </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-05 23:26:36 </DATE>

<TEXT> When the infection began it came with an alert on every platform. 


**THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. PLEASE READ/LISTEN TO THIS ENTIRE ALERT. A MEDICAL FACILITY IN [REDACTED] HAS BEEN BREACHED BY THE WATCHERS. A PATIENT WITH A DANGEROUS VIRUS WAS SET LOOSE. THE VIRUS WILL SPREAD UNTIL ALL AVAILABLE HOSTS ARE INFECTED. WE HAVE NO CURE. ENHANCED GENES LESS THAN FIFTY PERCENT WILL NOT BE AFFECTED. PLEASE STAY INSIDE YOUR HOMES AND DO NOT LET ANYONE ENTER OR LEAVE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.**


It played on a loop for an hour, so much for using any technology to distract myself. The world was already practically over, there's so many things I'll never get to do again, and right now going outside was one of those things. I looked out my window into the endless black sky, it's been black for months. The Watchers thought that would be amusing. It really isn't, it feels like the world has gotten colder since the loss of sunlight, but it hasn't. The sun isn't gone, it's just one of Their illusions. 


The Watchers have done a lot since the Ascension. Originally, they were just a group of Enhanced who were sent to see if we could find other life, or another home out there in the universe. No one ever thought we'd given them too much power. There were 2 billion people in the world after the Great Disasters that killed a majority of the population, and the governing forces of those people decided that we needed to find a way to prevent another Great Disaster in the future. 


The plan they came up with was to enhance the future children. Decades of labor from a species that was slowly dying out proved useful, and they eventually found a way. They injected hundreds of thousands of women with the serum that would create the Enhanced. Many of the women died after receiving the injection, some couldn't live through the gestation of the Enhanced, and in the end only five thousand lived to give birth after 15 months of pregnancy. The Enhanced took longer to cook. The unfortunate part was that not every child ended up being enhanced at all, about 80% of the children ended up being entirely normal-- besides the extended pregnancy. 


The other 20% had Enhanced genes. They would learn faster, be better at almost anything, stronger, faster, slightly longer lifespan, better memory, they were superhumans. A thousand Enhanced children entered the world, and in the last 200 years they have tried to grow more of their kind. Yet again the world was left to discover that not every woman could live to carry something that may potentially be Enhanced, and not every child was given the genes. Our population had plateaued at just under 1 billion, but we knew it would begin to drop again. The amount of Enhanced genetics that have been dispersed through our generations has made every pregnancy extended and potentially lethal, many women refuse to have children due to the risk. 


So many women have died, and so many other people just end their lives each day to escape the fact that we are nearing an inevitable end. The world around us goes on like we're not dying out, bodies are disposed of, the power is on, we live in our homes, we watch television, and we ignore impending death. Forget the fact that any pregnancy has become a potentially lethal condition, or the fact that we made a grave mistake by creating the Enhanced at all, everything just *goes on.* 


Everyone was excited when they announced that they were sending the Enhanced into space to attempt to find us a home that wasn't dying, and killing us slowly with it. They spent months testing everyone to make sure they only sent people with over 90% Enhanced genes. The best of the best, the smartest, they sent all they could find. When several thousand of the greatest Enhanced were sent into the sky, everyone was hopeful. A month later hope started to dim, the Enhanced ship came back and began circling the planet. They didn't send word, they didn't tell us if they had discovered anything that could save us, they just circled and watched. So we began calling the ones we sent away The Watchers.


After nearly two months of silence from the sky, they finally did something. They put up some kind of projection field, and blacked out the sky. People panicked, they thought that they had sped up the End. They thought we had lost the sun, the suicide rate skyrocketed. Then they sent their first message. They *laughed* and told us that the black sky was an illusion. They were fucking with us, proving how stupid the ones who stayed behind really were. It wasn't the first joke they'd pull on us, they seemed pleased to drive the remaining population insane. 


The virus leak is the latest in their sabotage of the human race. The virus was made by those who were highly Enhanced, but not enough to join the Ascension. We needed a way to get back at the Watchers, and they decided to work on a plague that would kill anyone who was over 90% Enhanced. There was less than a thousand of them left down here, they would be collateral damage when the Watchers decided to touch down. Personally, I thought it was a horrible idea. As if the Watchers would be stupid enough to come down while an infection that would end them was floating around. 


As of this moment they haven't perfected the virus anyways, and it is currently lethal to anyone who is as little as 50% Enhanced. That's a lot of people, more than half of us probably. Percentage is an important aspect in our lives, it helps us decide who to sleep with, who teaches us, who does our research. Enhanced are better in literally *every* aspect. It's the reason I'm dating the guy who I can see walking towards my house. For someone who tested 85% Enhanced, he was acting like an idiot. I gaped in shock through the window, he was going to get himself killed. When I opened the door to let him in, I greeted him by shouting, 


Are you brain damaged? The infection will kill you, you're probably dying right now. I frowned at him. 


Oh relax, I'm not dying. If walking across the street got to me, then opening the door would get to you, He smiled and pulled me into an embrace. 


I didn't meet his eyes after the hug, suddenly feeling a little guilty for lying about my percentage. He thinks I'm 80% when I'm only 47%. I couldn't help myself, when I met him last month I could just *tell* that he was above average. In *many* ways. I knew that someone like that wouldn't go for someone with a low percentage. Lying proved worth it though, he was *amazing* in every possible way. He seemed to believe that I was too, so that helped. I was pleased he was here, the infection would make life miserable until anyone who had it was dead. 


The information they'd given us on the medical trials made things clear as soon as testing started. If a patient was ever out of quarantine, the virus would remain airborne for up to a year after the last host died of infection. That means that we were stuck inside for quite some time. Well *I* wasn't, but I was with someone who couldn't know that. At that moment, I had to add Leaving my House to the list of things I might never again be able to do. On the bright side, sex during the apocalypse was great when you had someone Enhanced around, it was one form of entertainment that never got boring. 


As we were finishing I closed my eyes in bliss, and suddenly felt hot liquid drip onto my cheek, and no it was *not* what you're thinking. His sounds of pleasure turned into moans of agony. I looked up at him and was horrified, his eyes were clouded over in red. It leaked from his eyes, nose, mouth, and every single other orifice in his body. I was disgusted, but I couldn't escape from beneath him until his convulsions stopped and his body became entirely still. I struggled to push the dead weight off of me, and crawled out of my bed covered in his blood. 


I showered off and thought to myself that *obviously* it was a bad idea to do that when the possibility of him being infected was so high. I guess I was just hoping that maybe the virus wasn't close to us yet, but my hope was misplaced. I was slightly relieved that after watching others close to me die, that it would never hurt as much again. I was sad that he died, disgusted that it was in top of me, and disappointed that he had caught the infection so quickly, but I would never need to worry about him ever again. He was gone. 


Like everything else that has been ruined by the world and the Watchers, I added this to my *Never Again* list. 


*Never despair over death again. Never see the sun again. Never trust the Watchers again. Never be normal humans again. Never be at the top of the food chain again. Never go on a plane again. Never lie about my percentage again. Never sleep in that bed again.*


Life during the apocalypse is hard, but at least when it's over there will never again be any horror I haven't already seen.

<TEXT> She's actually quite a lucky one, a first for me. I set eyes upon her after years of hunting, and she was perfect. After a few months in the panic room I realized that she wasn't exactly what I thought, but would be useful in a way. 

You might call it Stockholm Syndrome, but once I let her into the main house she grew to like me a lot, and over time we worked to develop her into the amazing member of the legal community that she is now. She's always been aware that we would one day have an heir to my legacy, and I think she's pleased to have Amanda as a little side project. Nothing quite bonds a mother and daughter like discussions on how to stay out of the eyes of the Law.

<TEXT> They say that the behaviours of a person while they are still in childhood can sometimes indicate that they will grow up to be a serial killer, or a sociopath. It was for this reason that I've kept a close eye on my son his entire life. 


I thought I was doing well as a stay-at-home dad, but little James had some issues that I overlooked. I first noticed him doing odd things when he was four, he found a magnifying glass and was using it to torch ants. I didn't think much of it at the time, I *know* it was cruel for him to do, but I figured it was harmless. Sometimes people can't help playing God, I think part of being human is looking for some form of control in your life. 


When my sweet baby girl Amanda was born it was one of the best days of my life, but it seemed it may be the opposite for James. He didn't take well to her, though it may have been simply jealousy over having to share his parents with a new sibling, he had lived his first five years as an only child. As they grew he developed an interest in bothering his sister. He'd push her around, tease her, but it was fairly harmless. It never really bothered her until he escalated things. 


Amanda was the one who-- between her sobs-- revealed to me that she had witnessed James hurting animals. He had been throwing stones at birds, pulling the tails of stray cats, and apparently he had hit the neighbors dog with a large stick. She thought he was doing it in front of her just to make her cry. Him being nearly 9 at this time meant that he needed a serious lecture. When my wife got home we spoke with him together about how it was wrong to hurt animals, and he seemed to understand and promised he wouldn't do it again. 


He must have hid his cruel activities fairly well over the next few years, because the next time Amanda caught him doing something awful it had progressed greatly. She was 11, and he had sent her an email telling her to look at a video he had made. She came to me entirely distraught, barely able to speak, and showed me the video. It showed him and a female friend in someone's garage with two dogs. The whole things was horrible. 


They got the dogs to fight one another, and when they wouldn't James or the girl would jab them with some kind of taser. I was disgusted, the video went on until one of the dogs didn't get back up. Later that night after consoling Amanda until she went to sleep, I opened the email and showed my wife. She was a fairly prominent lawyer in the town, and her first action was to delete the email containing the video. She didn't want news getting out, but she also knew who the girl was, and where James was sleeping over that night. 


Not one to stand by while something so potentially career and future-life damaging could be circulating, my wife immediately got in her car and drove off. She later told me of what she did. She got to the house where James was supposed to be spending the night only to be told he wasn't there. After a short talk with his friend, she discovered he was actually at a girl's house. She got the address and went there next. 


She said that she spoke to the parents of this girl-- which means she probably yelled and threatened with some sort of legal jargon-- and they agreed that they should keep this quiet. No one wants to ruin the future of their children when they have the option to hide their reckless actions. She spoke to the girl and James, who confirmed that the only video sent out was to Amanda as a joke. They deleted the original copy, and then the email they had sent, received a lecture about animal cruelty and legal action, and James was taken home. My wife spent the car ride home threatening and scolding James for his actions, by the time they got here he seemed to understand that this was the *only and last* time that she would cover his ass for something so serious. 


That was the last incident before he left for college. That girl? He ended up marrying her when he was twenty three, at the wedding they both seemed to be better people. I was surprised when I met her, she seemed really nice, but maybe it was an act. I couldn't quite get over the fact that they had both done such a horrible thing. Something like that doesn't come from nowhere, they had to have done more. I'm know it's shameful to admit it, but when the two sadistic lovebirds didn't return to town after their honeymoon, I was a little relieved. 


The search for them lasted weeks, to no avail. Honeymoon gone sour everyone said, maybe they disappeared together. Maybe one killed the other and ran off, all anyone knew for sure was that they never came home. 


About two months after the disappearance, I awoke to a strange noise coming through the bedroom window. It sounded like someone was in our shed. I grabbed the gun from my closest and headed outside, worried I may be dealing with a thief. When I entered the shed I saw that the door to the panic shelter was open. This was odd and concerning, the door was usually hidden, I hadn't been down in years, and who would go into an underground panic shelter in the middle of the night? 


I started down the stairs with my gun raised, worried I could be dealing with some deranged homeless person who had claimed my secret room as a new home. What I saw when I reached the bottom was a bit of a surprise. There was Amanda standing with her back to me, and there was my missing son and his wife each with one leg shackled to the ground. 


I watched in awe as my daughter screamed at James, Go on, hit her, you fucking animal! When he didn't obey, I watched her jab him with a taser. 


I must have made a sound because James wife looked over at me and cried for help, causing Amanda to turn to me. She just laughed for a second, Well hi dad, what can I say? I found this room and it was just perfect, I know what I'm meant to do! People like them don't deserve to live, they all deserve to be caught and feel the pain they dealt. She smiled as she walked towards me. 


I pulled her into a hug, taking a moment to figure out what I wanted to ask, Honey, is this the first time you've done this to people? She nodded her head. Okay, so she wasn't a serial killer yet, Next time, close the panic room door, okay? I didn't build this room to have someone find out what it's for. She looked surprised, and then pleased. 


Don't worry honey, I made mistakes my first time too.


What can I say, like father like daughter.

<TITLE> Not Your Average Sibling Rivalry </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-02 20:29:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think when you're a twin you hear a lot more about this supposed twin telepathy. Not because it actually happens to you though, but because everyone *asks* if it does. Well, I don't think it did. As many times as we were pestered by other kids wondering if we knew each other's thoughts, we really never did. Well not more than the average person could know anyways. 


My name is Ashe, and my twin sister is named Willow. Not wanting to be part of the trend of rhyming names, or names with the same first letter, our parents decided we should be trees. They definitely aren't the worst names we could have ended up with, I've heard rumors that our grandmother suggested to name us Beverly and Bailey. I think I'd die of embarrassment if I had to deal with my family calling me Bev all the time. It just seems like a *mom* name, you know? 


Anyways, that's besides the point here. Willow and I were always kind of competitive with each other, even though I seemed to always be on the losing end. Actually, it's not even that *I* was competitive with her, it was that I wasn't allowed to be good at anything unless she could be too. She had to be better. She wanted all of the attention. 


I played soccer? She played it better. I got excellent grades? She'd take my work and either copy it, or pass it off as her own. There was no getting ahead of her. Sure, I knew I was slightly smarter than her, but being in the same classes didn't help. Her being everyone's favorite didn't help either. I wasn't exactly jealous, but I felt constantly disappointed in myself. Everyone overlooked me. We may have looked identical, but everyone could tell the difference. Being better at everything made Willow stand out next to me. 


When we were sixteen things changed for a short time. We went to a party together, and that night I think I realized that my twin sister was truly *evil.* More than just sibling rivalry, she had to hate me. It hasn't been long enough for me to be entirely comfortable talking about the whole situation, but I'll do what I can. We were going to a party together, the kind you have to sneak out of your window while your parents sleep to attend. For once my sister wanted me to outshine her. 


She helped me get dressed, and put on my makeup. She made me look beautiful, while she dressed casually. It's like we had switched places in the mirror. I think that's what she wanted. We snuck out just after 11, a friends car was waiting by the road to take us a few streets over for the party. When we got there Willows ex kept pestering us. He stalked us around the party, and while Willow left me to go talk to other people, he somehow became convinced that I was her. 


At this point I was a few too many drinks in, and I thought it would be funny to play along. I kissed him, and by the time we ended up in a room alone I realized that I had made a mistake. I tried again to tell him that I really wasn't her, but he told me he didn't care anymore. It was enough that I looked like her. Things went downhill from there, and when I saw Willow peek her head into the room, I thought she had come to save me. She didn't though, she watched it all happen, and snuck away before he left me there broken. 


It fucked me up. I didn't know who to tell, my sister watched it all happen and never told a soul, so I did the same. I kept it quiet, I started writing my feelings in a journal, and I became incredibly depressed. It got to the point where my parents actually became concerned, and they took me to a therapist. Though I wasn't ready to discuss what happened the therapist seemed to help somewhat, it gave me an unbiased person to talk to. With my parents so concerned for me, I was actually getting more attention than Willow for once. It didn't last long. 


Within a month things went downhill. Willow seemed to decide that if I got to be depressed, then so did she. She stole my journal, told our parents that it was hers, and they panicked. They couldn't have their favorite daughter turning into the sad little thing I had become. She stole my tragedy, openly talked about what her ex had done to *her.* I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone the truth, I still wasn't ready to admit what he did to me. She didn't hold back though, and things only became worse. 


She started lying about me, she told everyone that I saw it happen and did nothing to help. The entire world was against me, and my parents pulled me out of therapy. They decided that my sadness was actually guilt over not helping my sister, and I didn't deserve to feel better. Life became hell, there was no escape. I got a new journal, I sunk deeper into my feelings, I started mutilating myself just so that I would feel something that wasn't *sadness.* No one cared at all. Though I had lived my entire life in my sister's shadow, this was worse. I was a pariah. Nothing I did couldn't somehow be turned against me. 


Being upset wasn't okay, none of my problems existed, I was branded the liar who was trying to steal Willows problems. They found out I was hurting myself, it must have been because Willow was doing it. Everything I did *had* to be because of her. Everyone believed that I was the one trying to steal her life, her pain. I couldn't be my own person. This went on until after we turned 18. 


The school year was almost over, it was all almost over. I'd be able to leave, finally be free. I could make my own life, I could finally be my own person. I couldn't handle the past though, I needed to do something so that I wouldn't be followed by it. I could only think of one option, I plotted out how I would do it for weeks. It took me awhile to get the courage, but I was going to kill myself. My entire existence mattered to no one, everyone was disgusted by what Willow had convinced them to think about me. 


When our parents found the body, they also found the journal. The journal with *Ashe* written across the front. It didn't contain much, just apologies and the details of a planned suicide. They seemed devastated, but at the same time relieved. Their shameful daughter had done the world a favor. They held me while I cried, everything would be different now. They never believed in all the issues that Ashe had, they never understood that her pain had been stolen and used against her. They would never know. 


I never wanted my sister's life, I wanted my own life. Now I'm the only one around to live for both of us. She took my life in spite, but she didn't realize how much of me she took by stealing my death. 


My name was Ashe, but my sister stole that last part of me when she collapsed on the bathroom floor holding my journal. I finally have my life back, everyone knows what happened to me. Everyone knows how hard my life was, and saw the pain I suffered through. Now everyone calls me Willow.

<TEXT> Team: **Oblivious Train To Nowhere?**

Working Title: **Last Foster**

------

When I was younger I wanted kids more than anything else in the world, I still do. Children are just little tiny blessings, even when they act like hellions half the time. It was for this reason, when I discovered I would never be able to carry children of my own, that I decided I wanted to be a foster parent.


I was in the system for a while as a child, and I know first hand that not every family a child is sent to is an ideal home. There are some truly vile human beings that take in children. I wanted to be one of the ideal homes, one of the houses that makes you forget the fact that you've been taken from your family, and makes your stay feel like a real home. 


My husband was happy to do this with me, since alternative methods of having our own children were well out of our affordable range. We fostered children for years, and though every child has had their own issues and challenges, I have loved them all. There was one child we took in that was different though, the last child we ever provided a temporary home for. 

Kevin wasn't immediately different than other children we had cared for, but there was always something offputting about him. He was quiet, withdrawn almost. It wasn't uncommon for children who came from less fortunate situations, but I didn't have any solid information about his past. 

For some reason unknown to me, the organization wouldn't tell me anything about him other than name and age. I'm usually always given at least a minimal briefing on a child's past, I have to know what could trigger them. There are always topics to avoid, and different ways to be sensitive to different situations. With Kevin we had go in blind.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Notes to self:*

**March 2017:**

**3/1:** Someone from Illinois said that the story isn't logical because they've lived there their whole life and never even thought of pigs.. It's more for cattle. 

??? Wtf kind of observation is that? 

PS: I had to Google Pig Day to figure out what is was, and where it happens. Soooo there's that. 

**3/3:** I just got notified that "Not Your Average Sibling Rivalry" was gilded! It's the first time it's ever happened to me! Super exciting, I didn't even think it was that good o: 

**3/4:** Someone asked to narrate the Sibling Rivalry story, woo! It has also become my most popular story! 

**3/6:** Narration request and gilded on the new story! I adored writing "You Don't Do That To Family"!! I'm so happy that people like my work, this challenge is difficult, but so worth it. 

**3/11:** Posted almost late because I ended up changing from a SSS to a nosleep after making the initial story too long. 

**3/26:** This is so much fun. Got distracted and posted almost thirty minutes late. Appeal? 

In other news, Good Shade is a wonderful success. I'm so happy that so many people are hooked on it, I can't wait to add more to it in the future.

**May 2017**

**05/2:** Entirely forgot that yesterday was the first, so I've already used one appeal and posted two things today. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Last National Pig Day </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-01 14:07:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Have you ever heard of National Pig Day? I never did, until I moved to Illinois in sixth grade. That was the only year I ever took part in any festivities. 


This was a little over ten years ago, I was 12 at the time. My family had just moved down from the U.P to Illinois for my dad's job. We ended up living in a small town nearly an hour from the city he'd be working in, but he wasn't worried about it. 


I'd had the whole school year to adjust to the new place by the time March 1st rolled around. I knew that there was going to be a trip to the zoo, but I didn't know why or what everything else going on was for. I entered school that day to the scent of bacon, it was amazing. The lunch ladies had all pitched in and made scrambled eggs and bacon for the all of the students, even a few teachers joined in on the meal. 


Though we had less than 200 kids, it was still quite the effort they had put in. By the time I had settled down at a table with my meal, my friends had filled me in on this odd holiday, so I kind of understood why we got to do special things. Everyone was mowing down their breakfast, but I only ate my bacon. I passed off my eggs to a friend. I've never liked eggs at all, they've always made my stomach hurt. 


We loaded onto the buses after eating and everyone was excited. The trip to the zoo was supposed to be the highlight of the day. I ended up falling asleep on the bus ride there, and I awoke to find that everyone else on the bus was sleeping too, save for a few teachers who were screaming or crying. I guess Miss Lawrence saw me sitting up, because she came and pulled me out of me seat and off the bus. 


I was really confused and scared at this point. Outside there were a few other kids standing around looking freaked out, the teachers were asking them questions. Miss Lawrence turned to me a lowered herself to my level. 


Amy, did you eat at school today? 


Mhm, just bacon though, I don't like eggs. 


She didn't say another word, just shook her head and escorted me to sit with the other students. I could hear the teachers talking to each other, while one of them dialed the police. 

One of the teachers started freaking out, screaming to the sky asking why someone would do this to children. She broke down in tears next to Miss Lawrence, with one final question, 

"Why did we live, why are these kids okay?" 


None of them ate the eggs.

Haha not taking this back but realized after posting this that I have to run a NST, post a story every single day, and finish this damn series I've been working on for a few weeks. 

At least the series will be in approved subs, and will make up at least 3+ days worth of stories if I get around to working on it... 

Anxious and excited, will be a good way to inspire me to keep writing after the challenge while I'm "away" for a month and a half soonish.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw that in theatres only because I was already there and Split was sold out :( 

Now everyone who reads this is gonna die D: You only have to think about the name to have him come and mindfuck you to death. 

I'm making up a monster, right? 

Okay so:

Adam was a regular college guy, until a camping trip changed his life. There was a radical group of devil worshippers who roamed the woods that he and his three younger siblings had planned to spend a little bonding trip for the night. The devil worshippers ended up finding their camp in the middle of the night, forcing Adam to watch as his younger siblings were mutilated and tossed in the roaring bonfire. They finally burned him alive after he witnessed this and received his own torture. The worshippers thought they were pleasing the devil, but they said the incantation to summon him wrong, and Adam did not truly die that night. 

His mangled body roams the woods looking for campfires, but his soul is gone, so anyone at the fire is assumed to be one of the worshippers who tortured his young siblings and damned him to spend eternity in the mutilated and decaying body. 

He was a big guy, over six feet. But the torture left him skinless in spots, his hair melded with his melted flesh, and the incantation did not stop his body from decaying over time, but kept him alive. In honor of his youngest sibling who was only 3, and due the mixed up spell, the last thing you'll ever feel and hear as this hulking grotesque creature comes to cast you into your campfire, is a soft poke in the nose and a raspy whisper of, "boop". </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was in September, but that was the contest that they were in. 

I just found it odd that the voice actor would contact me, and then the guy who runs it (I believe he said his name was Craig) was the only one who corresponded with me after that one initial request. Sucks that there was no notification that they decided on another story, but contest-wise I can see how so many actors changing their minds who knows how many times could create confusion and leave an email or two unanswered if they weren't getting all the permissions themselves but instead had to have the guy who runs the show do all the official stuff. 

**Edit:** For reference, this is the email I received: 

Hello, Ms. [My last name],

<TEXT> The story requested for adaptation was actually not extremely popular, around 400-500 upvotes. Got me excited, but a shame they didn't respond to any of my questions though. Kind of a let down, but they do put out a lot of narrations, so it'd be cool to see it pan out well for another nosleep writer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright, let me elaborate on my response, because I can't attest to how shady they may be since they have a fairly large following on YouTube. 

For some reason I don't have the message from the guy running it in my inbox, but I have the message from the narrator who requested to read my story. 

The account was wondercustard which I've looked at and it's pretty blank. But they contacted me asking to read my story for a contest to become a permanent narrator for the channel. 

Looking at one of the two things the user posted, he linked to the story narration. Apparently just picked a different story to narrate for the contest it seemed, didn't watch it, just read the story title that came up a minute into the video. 

By those standards, not as shady, but slightly annoying that they didn't respond when I was checking to see if they were using the story, because I didn't reply to a separate narration request from someone else due to the fact that they never responded if it would be okay for another channel to narrate it (was not sure at the time what the media release would mean) and by the time I realized they were not using my story, it had been weeks since the other channel asked me and I felt bad for not replying sooner, and I don't think they narrated it either.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's almost always a slow start, because making something popular is just dumb luck. Most of what I've written goes overlooked, I've had two pretty decent stories, some other mid level and some that sit around with 15-40 upvotes or less. Though I enjoyed writing them all, and think that some of the less voted ones are just as good as my one "very" popular story, it's all dumb luck. I've deleted stories in shame, but I felt worse about throwing away my hard work than I did having it up but unread. 

I have a series "in progress", super slow because I decided "Time-line be damned I want to finish what I started". 

I deleted the second part soon after posting, because I hated that it didn't live up to the first one, I hated the way I wrote it, and I hated that I posted it before I was ready because I didn't want to diaaapoint the ~400 people who upvoted the first part, I wrecked my own motivation. After a couple months I rewrote and reposted, making sure I asked the mods if it was acceptable to do so based on the fact that I had posted it carelessly, too soon, and without enough effort put in at all. Just personal crap put on top of feeling bad that it might not be good. Now it sits with less than 50 votes. But it's *there*. I did it, and I left it open for a new character to absorb the story and continue on when I'm actually ready, votes be damned I love my virus. 

Don't second guess your stories, if you think that the quality of your writing was bad, or you left obvious plot holes, or something that would make *you* not read the story, then I can understand removing and reworking it, but if you thought it was good, and can't find a real issue with it (not counting the fact that most of us hate what we've written soon after it's posted, that issue doesn't count) then leave it up. 

One day you'll hit it lucky and people will be checking back through your posts to get more of you. Maybe those few small upvotes are from fans you've already made. Maybe there's people like me, who share a story with people I know because I think it's great, and it sure would be a shame if it was removed before I could share it. 

Gotta begin with loving the idea and process, post it while it still feels good, and let the rest be damned. Because you did it. 

And hey, I don't have any awards, but think of this: 

One of my stories is in the top of the week with ~2000 votes, a story I wrote two days after, and that I believe is equally good, albiet less twisty at the end, is sitting around with like thirty something votes? 

It's random until you've been around long enough to make a lot of people want to check your every story. I mean I can see how it seems like awards=popularity, but I've read stories from people who have awards that I didn't vote on because I didn't really like them. People who have awards are mostly the people who also have social media for their work, blogs, websites, actual published work, etc. They work hard for it most of the time. 

Not everything that's popular is great, consider the top posts of this current week. Not being rude or anything, but I read the whole series without voting, without being invested, or even really caring what would happen. Wasn't my cup of tea, I spent all week waiting for it to take a turn or get more interesting for me, and it didn't. I didn't really like it. But everyone has their own opinions. 

A story like that might get an award at the end of the month because it was so popular, but I think there's better stories out this month that I'd be sad to see *not* win. 

Yadda yadda I'm rambling.  </TEXT>

Do you read horror? Do you enjoy it? Do you enjoy the horror that you write? 

If yes to all if the above, then you're already writing to the audience and what they like, because you are part of it. 

Doesn't matter how it's recieved once it's out there, as long as you were enjoying the journey to get it there. 

Honestly, the only thing I've noticed about the audience, is they go for titles. Everyone's done it before, interesting title? Yea, let's check it out. But even that is all about you, you're the one putting in the work. And votes don't equal readers :) There are people without accounts who read and can't vote, people who just don't vote, and the random mysterious instant down voters, so you can't always go off the numbers anyways c:  </TEXT>

Back when I posted my first story I had put a post in the OOC about something I don't remember, and he/she(? I've never known) read it and liked it (I think? Horrible memory but I know the jingle stuck in their mind). 

My most recent greatest achievement was something that made me literally freak out and tell my family because I was so happy, DefinitelyNotNic had mentioned me in a comment (and a bunch of other writers) linking the story that had made her a fan. There was a little thread that went on with her and someone else about how they liked the story, and it makes me teary eyed honestly.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'll Never Take City Transit Again </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-22 02:32:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You never expect something bad to happen when a day starts off as entirely normal. It was for this reason that when I found myself pointing a gun at a seventeen year old kid, I started laughing hysterically, the weapon shaking in my grip. But maybe I should backtrack a little. 


This was a few weeks ago now, but I remember it clear as day. I woke up to the radio blaring some argument about the new president, annoying but average ever since he's been in office. Shower, coffee, accidentally burn myself with said coffee, finish getting dressed, check the time, head out the door. Normal, boring, morning routine. 


I stood near the bus stop waiting, smoke in progress, when a teenage boy shuffled up to the shelter and sat down inside. From where I stood I could tell this kid was already having a shitty day. He sat there slouched, knee bouncing a mile a minute, disheveled blonde hair hidden under a dark hoodie, with a face of extreme agitation. I debated striking up a conversation to see if I could improve his morning, but decided against it. I'm no therapist, and I tend to be overly aggressive and condescending when presented with someone feeling bad over something pointless. So I avoided him, because well, what high school age kid isn't usually feeling crappy about something stupid? 


Not gonna lie, I was also a little freaked out by him. I'm probably only about 5 years older than this kid, with relatively decent looks, but I *look* maybe 15. It's an annoying part of my life that has me IDd and scrutinized for pretty much everything a regular 22 year old partakes in. That's besides the point though, I just really didn't want the kid to get the wrong idea, and then have to let him down during an already subpar morning. He just seemed so twitchy that he might explode if something else messed up his day. 


I can explain my thinking over and over, but it doesn't hide the fact that talking to him might have drastically altered how the next hour would play out. I knew it was never really an option though, because as I stepped on the butt of my smoke I saw another kid approach the boy in the hoodie. The girl seemed to be concerned for him, but he blatantly told her to fuck off as soon as she opened her mouth. She quickly hustled back to the group of students waiting for the bus near the curb. 


Commence the hushed whispers and sideways glances towards the twitchy kid. All I could think was that I despised the fact that I had to use public transit at the same time that these assholes were headed to school. I couldn't contain my annoyance, this is the kind of bullyish behaviour that wrecked high school for me. I muttered quietly to myself, Catty children, like it's the end of the world you got told to fuck off. Biggest news story of the day.


I sighed as I looked away from the group, only to turn and see the boy sporting a small smile in my direction. Apparently I spoke a little louder than intended, but I can't say that I wasn't a little pleased to see the kid perk up a little. Right about then the bus rolled up, and I checked my phone for the time. It was almost ten minutes early, which was rare, but also part of the reason I wait at the stop so far in advance. With thirty minutes between buses, missing this one would put a wrench in my work day. 


I was the last one on, just after the kid. He stopped to give a surprisingly cheerful greeting to the driver, Hey Verin, you're early. Good to see ya. 


The driver impatiently waved him along, Cmon don't got all day here. Need to get this done, now or never. Finish your deal, go sit down.


The kid moved happily to the back of the bus and took a seat. I stood still for a moment, a little confused by the exchange, until the driver requested that I get a move on and stop holding up his route. *That was a drastic mood shift. I wonder how this kid is so tight with the driver, I've been riding the same route every day for two years without seeing him, but maybe he's new. Maybe he drove another route the kid has been on before.* I shook myself out of my random thoughts, and did what I usually did on the bus. I people-watched. 


The blonde kid sat in the back, apparently in a wonderful mood now that the bus was moving. The rest of the high school kids were spread in small groups throughout the bus, some were loudly boasting about the parties they went to on the weekend and parties planned for the next. A few little groups and pairings of girls were whispering, giggling, showing each other things on their phones, or a combination of those activities. There were maybe two or three kids that were just sitting quietly, or reading. After my assessment of the passengers I realized two things; Other than the driver I was the only adult riding today, and I didn't recognize the neighborhood we were driving through. 


The drivers voice came from the speakers just then, Express, express, we're all wasting time sitting on this bus. Wasting time just isn't an option. 


I only had a moment to glance around and see that the a few of the other passengers looked as confused about the announcement as I was. That's when everything went left. The bus sped up, and shots rang out. It all seemed to happen in an instant, suddenly I found myself crowded by the door with the few kids who had been keeping to themselves near the front of the bus. The driver next to us laughed as he continued recklessly down the road. The kid in the hoodie was coming towards us, blood splattered across him as he walked past the slumped bodies of the students he had ended. 


He was within five feet of our small cluster when he raised the gun again, and somehow my human instinct kicked in enough to make me stand protectively in front of the group of crying teenagers. I don't know why you're doing this, but you can stop now. You don't need to hurt anyone else, I pleaded as I stepped cautiously towards him, hands splayed in front of me. 


He smiled, I'm done, then calmly handed me the gun. On impulse I pointed it at him, expecting for it to be a trick. He followed the surrender of the gun by setting himself down in the nearest seat, No, really. My deal is done, you're good. 


This was when my brain decided it was a good time to burst into a fit of laughter. The gun shook in my hand, and I practically screamed, You just shot like fifteen kids, and I'm supposed to be *good!?* I was floored, among other things. How the fuck was this kid smiling nonchalantly after murdering almost all of the passengers? 


Yea, I'm done. Sooo, you're safe for now. We're gonna stop, and my friend is gonna make sure you won't have this memory very long. I just stared at him while he smiled back at me, like I'm supposed to be reassured that someone else is going to finish me off when the bus stops? 


I don't know how I wanted to respond, because that's when the bus came to an abrupt stop. It knocked me to the ground and the gun slid away. I stood up in a renewed state of panic, the driver was gone, and the few kids who hadn't been hit were rushing out the front door. I had fallen near the back doors, and rushed to get up and out, slamming into the blonde killer in my attempt. He gripped me by the shoulders as I stood, and for some reason his last words to me are what chilled me the most. 


Its time to pay Abadin for the gift of vengeance he gave to me. Then he released me and hustled out the doors. 


I followed quickly behind, but turned away from the group and hid behind the bus, using my relative safety to dig my phone out of my pocket and dial 911. I peeked my head around the bus to see what had become of the group of kids, and was surprised to see them all standing calmly beside the bus along with the killer-kid. They were staring off in the distance, and I followed their gaze towards the boy who was now approaching. 


The boy walked casually toward the scene, as though he expected it to be there. He couldn't have been much older than the kid who lost his shit in there, but he had to be at least six foot, sporting semi long black hair, and pale as a ghost. If it hadn't been for the kids also staring at him I would of thought I was experiencing some form of PTSD, this guy was way too calm. It was only seconds before he arrived in front of the group and stopped, but it felt so much longer. 


He glanced in my direction, and suddenly the dial tone I had been hearing was cut off. My phone was entirely dead. It was at this moment that I decided I didn't want to see this accomplice finish off the rest of them, and decided to haul ass in the opposite direction. 


Since then things have been odd, I tried calling the cops and they told me that it was inappropriate to try and gain attention off of this recent tragedy. At the time I had no clue why they thought I was lying. Now I've been watching the news daily, looking for the story on the shooting, but it never came. Instead there was this story: 


17 teenagers from [local high school] have tragically perished in a fatal bus crash. [City transit committee] reported that one of their buses had been hijacked by one of their workers. Police have yet to locate the driver, but have found evidence leading them to believe he may have been working with a student who planned to harm his classmates for bullying him. (Photo of the blonde kid next to photo of the driver). The bus was taken off route and driven off a highway overpass, landing in oncoming traffic. There were no confirmed survivors, other than the bus driver whom the police are still searching for. Please call [hotline] if you have any information on his whereabouts. [Segment including more details and information about the victims].


I'm not sure what happened that day, none of it makes sense to me. I was *on* that bus. No one believes me, and I'm starting to not believe myself. The only conclusion I can draw is that the kid and his accomplice somehow forced the survivors back on the bus, and then drove it to it's end. That still doesn't account for the dark haired kid though, because only the 17 kids I rode the bus with were accounted for. All I know for sure now is that I'll never take city transit again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You make a good point, around 9 decades ago or so, I used to go for the higher class type, but these days it's more difficult. Wealthy people are cautious about who gets close to them, and many have a large circle of people watching out for them and their money, even if they're relatively reclusive. Not to mention how publicized the deaths of people of that caliber are nowadays. Even if I went with someone and didn't decide I wanted to dine on them, but instead the people around them, eventually any human with extended contact goes insane. I can't help it. 

It would make it entirely too hard to slip out of their lives unnoticed, and then I'd have to entirely scrap my body, and I do enjoy running through a cycle of specific appearances. I suppose I could create a sort of "throwaway" body, but I enjoy being young and desirable. Then I have to consider the amount of time it would take to gain trust enough to enjoy the lavish life. I'd starve before I got close enough, and too many meals while working on that trust would make me even more suspect. 

From a human perspective, think of doing a dine and dash. It's a lot easier to get out of a low end establishment than it is from a 5-star. No security, less witnesses, and less people eyeing you down and sizing up your appearance. 
 
Similar is the bodyguard option, my client would die if I stayed too long, a sad fate I've once dealt with. 

I want for naught though, my mother is actually in an arrangement that will keep us quite well off for the entirety of our existence. But that's a story for another time. :)  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to Drive a Boy Crazy </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-19 07:37:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just found this typed up document in my boyfriends cell phone. It's kind of like a journal, but I found some parts a little bothersome. Alex has been sleeping for a while, which is the only reason I even have time to look through his phone. I wasn't trying to be nosy or anything, I just wanted to see the book he had been typing up for the last few months. Instead, I found this document titled Tell nosleep. I figured it was just some wild story, but he actually used my name, my likeness, and some pretty true information. 


Some of the ways he described me made me smile, my mother would be proud of the woman I have become. I'm off track though, so here is the account which Alex wrote up about me, which apparently is meant to convince you all of.. I'm not sure what exactly. That I drove him crazy? I'm not some psychopath. Regardless, here is what he wrote for you. 


---


Sorry if this all feels rushed, lately I've been feeling like something awful is about to happen, and I just wanted to tell people before it does. I'm really sick and just desperately need help understanding if my mind is lying to me. Maybe the people who were my friends will see this and realize that they abandoned me when a monster crawled into my bed. 


I'm pretty sure I've figured out where this all started, and unless my mind has entirely left me, then I'm pretty sure Luna has something to do with this. Luna has been my girlfriend for the past few months, she's generally really amazing, but the longer we're together the more I realize that something is *very* wrong here. To keep everything as accurate as possible I'm putting my entire experience with her together from entries I wrote in my journal. 


I'm guessing the real story starts around the time of this entry from the end of July, though I'm still not 100% sure how it all connects, or if it really does at all. 


**July 28th 2016:**


*Meg is going to break up with me. She won't believe anything I tell her. I haven't written about this yet because I thought it'd blow over once she realized that this whole thing was crazy, but now I've got to record it so that I'll never forget the lengths that some random crazy chick (who I don't even know), went to fuck up my two year long relationship.*


*I went to a party last weekend, couple friends were going and invited me to come along, I'm guessing this is where the crazy bitch got both mine and Meg's numbers. Not sure exactly how she did it, but the shit storm started the next morning. Meg woke me up freaking out, waving my phone around. Apparently I had been receiving messages non stop all morning, and she decided to check in case it was some kind of emergency.*


*Some random girl was sending me half naked photos, and messages about how she couldn't stop thinking about me. Suffice to say Meg was pissed, and she didn't believe that I had no idea who this girl was. She didn't say her name or show any identifiable part of her, so I didn't even have a clue as to who could be fucking with me.That's been my whole week, everyday there are messages from this girl. I tried blocking the number but then she started using a different one, she went as far to text Meg's phone to try and talk to me. Regardless of the blocking, messages asking to stop, and Meg actually calling and freaking out, this girl keeps insisting that her and I had some sort of intense connection that she can't ignore.*


*Meg already told me that she's ready to walk, she's convinced I cheated on her at this party, but she's the one who drove me home and slept with me afterwards. She won't believe a word I say otherwise. This is insane.*


**August 2nd 2016:**


*Meg's friend was here today to grab the last of the packed up boxes. It's been three days since I've seen her, and she doesn't believe that I stopped receiving the messages the day she left. The last time she spoke to me she told me that my new bitch had sent her a text the night after she moved out, something along the lines of Thanks for making room for me.*


*I don't understand why this is happening to me. I was perfectly happy.*


I'm gonna skip ahead so that you'll just be reading relevant information. Just so you're not confused about the locations, when I went back to school for the fall, around the end of August I moved out of my apartment and into a residence hall on campus. I couldn't really afford to stay through the semester at the old place without Meg helping with rent. 


**September 17th 2016:**


*I keep seeing this girl who's staying in a room down the hall, just barely though. She's always just walking by, or going into her room. I have this intense urge to talk to her, she's gorgeous. I walked by her room the other day and I'm pretty sure I heard her singing, she sounded like an angel. I'm going to try to figure out who she is, maybe she could be the first worthwhile distraction I've had from missing Meg.* 


**September 25th 2016:**


*Party last night was great, especially because I finally got to talk to the girl from down the hall. Her name is Luna and she seems even more beautiful when you speak to her. Fair skin, pale blonde hair, tiny, but with just enough curves to keep you interested. She told me that she's going to major in Psychology, which seems pretty cool. Smart and hot, I would definitely like to see her more.*


*She sent me a text this morning thanking me for keeping her interested enough to not leave the party early, I don't think she's really the type who enjoys big parties. Weird thing is, I don't remember giving her my number. I know I wanted to, but I distinctly recall being annoyed at myself for forgetting to ask for hers last night. She probably just asked someone else if they knew it. Brought back crappy memories of Meg though, but I'm probably just paranoid about getting into someone new.* 


**October 23rd 2016:**


*Luna is just perfect, I swear I've already fallen in love with her. It's like I'm under a spell, and I love it. From that first conversation at the party last month I've felt so much better. She's helping me forget the craziness that ended my last relationship, and also helping me to realize that Meg really took a lot of things I did for granted. I didn't deserve her mistrust. Luna would never do that. I know it's pretty soon after meeting her, but we're already in an official relationship.*


*Her face was so full of joy when I asked her, I think it's part of why that was the best day of my life so far. I know it'll sound crazy, but I could honestly envision myself marrying this girl. I am downright stricken by how wonderful she is. She thinks I'm working on writing a book right now, something I've always wanted to attempt, but I just told her that so I wouldn't have to admit that I'm writing about her in a very 14 year old girl gushing into a diary type of way. I feel ridiculous, but I've just never felt this way about someone.* 


**November 2nd 2016:**


*I swear I fall more in love every time I hear her singing in the shower, I have no idea what she's singing but it's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. I asked her about the songs once, and she told me that her mother taught her them all. Apparently someone in her family actually created them, which I thought was pretty interesting. She never goes into much detail about her family, except to say that her mother didn't like to stay in one place very long so they always travelled around. I figure this is just something she's not entirely comfortable talking about just yet, it's pretty clear from her avoidance that she didn't quite have the American Dream of childhoods.* 


**November 12th 2016:**


*I swear my memory is going to shit, I'm so forgetful lately, but that's hardly important with what's going on with Luna right now. She seems like she's getting sick, she's had such low energy lately. So far none of the medication she's taken seems to be getting rid of this cold, but she keeps assuring me it'll pass. I've been sad, I miss hearing her sing these last few days. It feels hard to distract myself from the past without her regular bubbly personality filling up the room.* 


**November 18th 2016:**


*Luna is still sick, but she's cheered up a little and has been humming songs again. She told me she'll be better once she eats, but she's been so nauseous that she can hardly keep anything down. We're going to visit her Mother for Thanksgiving though, and she's really excited about it. Her Mom mailed us two plane tickets, and invited us to spend the holiday with her on the coast of Mexico. Luna has been telling me she misses the ocean, lakes just aren't the same. Plus Mexico will be significantly warmer than Michigan at this time of year, so I am especially excited to spend some beach time with my wonderful girl.* 


**November 29th 2016:**


*My memory is being kind of.. Wonky? I just keep forgetting to do little tasks, I'm not sure if I'm forgetting real memories. We had a good time in Mexico, I think. Little fuzzy on all the details, but I attribute that to jet lag. Luna's mom was really nice, she seemed to really like me. Luna looks a lot like her, and Mary looked so young they could practically be sisters. I'm over the moon that her mom approved of me, that means I'm one step closer to having this girl for the rest of my life.* 


*So, about Mexico, had a great time. The coast was beautiful, and after the first night there Luna didn't seem sick at all anymore. She told me her mom has a special recipe that always makes her feel better, I'm a little disappointed I never got to try that miracle meal. Luna spent a lot of time with her mother, they're really close. I think it's sweet, but it makes me even more curious about the secrecy over Luna's past. Other than that it was a pretty basic vacation. Visits to the beach, a couple nights of bar crawling, quality time.* 


*Halfway through the trip Meg texted me saying she missed me. Honestly I had pretty much forgotten that I ever even dated her, so the message threw me off a little. I mentioned it to Luna, and she laughed at the fact that Meg finally realized what she lost. I overheard her talking to her mom in another room afterwards, and for some reason something she said set off the little alarms in my head. Something along the lines of, I can't believe she'd say anything after all this time, it took a lot of effort to get her to make way for me and I'm not having my work ruined now.*


*Her mother's response was even more confusing, Perhaps you should return to the body of Jessica to keep her off. Prove your loyalty, facing the same issue with a better outcome would definitely keep him prepared. The conversation kinda freaked me out and I stopped listening. I can't help but wonder if the body of Jessica is referring to someone dead. Who talks like that if it's not about a dead body?* 


*I guess being there cleared my head because my memory cleared up a little. Realized some weird things though, like where the fuck is my roommate? I haven't seen him since early October, but I can tell I've been forgetting a lot of basic things. Maybe he has a girlfriend he's been staying with, but for the life of me I can't remember him telling me that he was leaving. His stuff is still here, and the policy here has you pay for the entire year in the hall, so he's wasted a lot of money to pay for a room that he's only spent a month in. I forgot all about him for a while, apparently absence does not at all make the heart grow fonder.*


*Besides that, I've been missing a lot of class without realizing, and I've hardly spoken to any of my friends in the last month. It feels like everyone's avoiding me. Ever since that conversation I heard, I keep wondering if Luna killed some girl. I know it's crazy, but just the way they were talking in secrecy has me paranoid for some reason. Luna is too tiny to kill anyone though, how's a tiny little 51 blonde going to get away with killing someone?*


**December 5th 2016:**


*I've been split in two since returning from Mexico. One part of me is sappy and in love, just missing the sound of Luna singing in the shower. She's been so busy and distracted since we came back that she hasn't spent a lot of time here. The other part of me is paranoid and suspicious, and slightly convinced that I'm going crazy. Why exactly has she been gone so much? It's just making me wonder more about the whole Jessica's body conversation.*


**December 9th 2016:**


*I've been having this recurring dream for a while now, and I'm not sure what to think of it. I'm falling, and slowly a voice fades in. It's Luna's singing. I fall until I hit water, but it doesn't hurt. The entire dream is just me falling and then sinking into this water, all to a soundtrack of my girlfriends voice. It ends abruptly with a feeling of panic, and a flash of shark teeth coming straight for me. It makes me more sad than afraid. I'm stuck with this overwhelming feeling of despair, and the only place I've heard her sing lately is in my dreams. I think I'm just missing her too much. I wish she was around more.* 


**December 15th 2016:** 


*Luna has been around a lot more again, and I'm overjoyed! Her singing fills my heart with happiness, and eases my paranoia. While I still have concerns over the conversation I heard last month, I figure I'll just approach her about it later. She's always been so understanding, I'm sure I just missed a key part of their discussion.*


*In other news, her mother has sent us tickets again! She's staying in a different part of Mexico right now, but we'll still be close to the beach. Nothing like a warm vacation to perk up the Christmas season! I can't tell who's more excited, Luna and I are really happy to be spending the holidays together again.*


**January 5th 2017:** 


*Still in Mexico. In the hospital actually. I got bitten by a fucking shark. I suppose my dream was a little prophetic, maybe my mind was telling me that the ocean is dangerous. Just a bite on my shoulder, not super deep, and apparently healing quite fast. More of a shark nip than a bite. I pretty much blacked out during the incident, because the last thing I remember before waking up in the hospital was just swimming at the beach.* 


*It's not really a big deal, some stitches in my shoulder, maybe a scar to tell the tale later. Pain meds have me loopy, but I'll be able to go back to where we're staying with Luna's mom tonight. Maybe it's just because I'm high, but I decided to ask Luna if she knew someone named Jessica. She looked surprised, and then sad. Apparently Jessica was her cousin, who drowned in lake Michigan. She told me she's been visiting the lake a lot lately, unable to keep her cousin entirely off her mind this time of year. The explanation satisfied my curiosity, and I felt bad for listening in before. Obviously eavesdropping is like a game of telephone, you're bound to mishear parts.*


**January 8th 2017:**


*Broken telephone once again, I really need to stop being so paranoid and pessimistic. I'm happy with Luna, happier than I've ever been in my life. It's like just because I think she's too good to be true, my mind is trying to find the flaws that break the illusion of perfection. I don't even know why this conversation bothered me, it was weird more than it was suspicious. Maybe her and her mother are delusional, talking about random nonsensical things.* 


*This time it was just odd. Her mom was complaining to her about deciding to be blonde, yet I was fairly sure they were both natural blondes. I'm not satisfied with this body, I didn't have time to perfect it. Mary had said.*


*Well, that's your own fault. I told you we were coming, and I like mine. It's adorable. Plus, it's not like you're the one who's stuck with it constantly, you'll change as soon as we leave. I mean, it could have just been some regular girls chitchat over looks, but the tone was weird as hell. God I am so paranoid. I need to ask someone for help.* 


This is the day I decided to start compiling my situation for you, after all the weird things that have been happening I thought I should seek out help from a community that knows about all sorts of scary shit. And the sicker I get the more afraid I become. From here on out I'll be writing my journal entries directly into this document. I'll be posting it for you all when I either have answers, or have too much information to fit in a single post. 


**January 23rd 2017:**


*I can tell I'm getting sick, it's been coming on since before we left Mexico. I feel so weak lately, I have no motivation to do anything, or talk to anyone. I haven't been back to classes yet, even though we've been back in Michigan for over a week. Luna has been bright and happy again, she's been singing to try and cheer me up. It hasn't really been working, I'm in pain and nearly out of medication. I've been having that nightmare over and over, waking up so violently that I've torn my stitches open so many times. It seems like my shoulder isn't healing at all, and it's come to the point where the wound doesn't hurt but the rest of my body aches.*


*Maybe I've got some sort of infection, but I'm becoming even more paranoid lately and just really don't want to go to a doctor. What if it was the hospital that did this to me? I know it sounds crazy, but how else can I explain this? Luna has been so worried about me, I'm terrified that I'm going to scare her away. I'm going insane and I don't know why.*


**January 26th 2017:**


*I'm seeing things, I know it's not real, but I'm so afraid. Why am I so sick? Everything hurts.* 


**February 3rd 2017:**


*Luna says I have a fever. I could swear she smiled when she said it, but instead of her dazzling smile I saw a mouth full of jagged shark teeth. I'm going insane. My shoulder hasn't been healing, I'm too afraid to have a doctor look at it. Thank god Luna knows how to do stitches. Why does Luna know how to that? I don't know anything anymore.* 


**February 5th 2017:** 


*My girlfriend is a shark. Did she bite me? Did she bite me with her shark mouth? Why does she know everything? I don't understand.*


**February 9th 2017:**


*My fever is down, I'm feeling a bit better. I realized a big thing I had forgotten, I haven't talked to my mother in forever. She's all I've got family wise, but she wouldn't answer my calls today. I told Luna about it, and she looked at me like I was crazy. Apparently I had a huge fight with my mom back in December, and she's been refusing to talk to me since then. Luna didn't know what it was about, and I can't remember. I feel like she's lying to me.Can't trust sharks. God what is wrong with me?*


**February 15th 2017:**


*Why is my angel a shark? Why am I sick? I think she's keeping me sick. Her teeth terrify me. Am I awake? Why am I here? I keep dreaming of the inky depths of the ocean. Did the ocean make me sick? Is Luna a monster? Is she a shark? Please help me. I need to post this as soon as possible, I can't stand how sick and crazy I've become. I'm so tired, I'll post this in the morning.*


----


Alex didn't wake up the next morning though, he's been in a coma since that night. The fever took hold of his mind and made him see things, but not what he thought. It's funny how the mind can betray you, how a siren's song can be so hypnotic that your mind becomes compliant to whatever the ancient language requests. 


Normally a mother would tell you not to play with your food, but mine taught me that everything tastes better once it's been stirred around. 


Time to take a dip, fade out of Luna and erase the body that was the girlfriend of Alex. I do miss the ocean, I think it's best to meet my mother on a coast for while, I've fished these lakes too much the last year between Luna and Jessica. By the time I get there I'll be a 56, leggy redhead. I wonder what the boys of California will think. 


I told you I'm not a psychopath, I'd have to be human for that.

<TEXT> Okay so, I'd start out with "Police officers are a blessing... " right off the bat, that whole section has a different tone than the rest. I'd end the paragraph right before "Now my town..."

I'd start the second paragraph with, "My name is Daniel Merc." Followed by "Now my town.." And everything else. 

Also I didn't read it all. Hard to look at on mobile when it's just one big wall of text, so definitely split up into paragraphs. I read as much as I could though, and your writing seems good, and I'd love to read the rest if you have a copy somewhere that is broken up to make it easier on the eyes. From the part I read, it seems interesting enough so far, but I'd like to be able to get through the entire prologue to give you a full opinion. Good luck c:  </TEXT>

I like writing from a male perspective, but I am an old man deep in my soul. I find it hard to relate to the majority of girls my age anyways. Disconnect makes it easier to switch sides. Also, girls are hot, so I enjoy being a vulgar young man at times. Or the father that everyone wishes they had (until he kills his children).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just find myself really paranoid as new things are trying to get passed. I attended most of high school down here because the schools are free to anyone, but I've been hearing that Trump wants to take that out of play. 

I live here with my family, My step mom and three younger brothers are Canadian, Her husband is American and we just haven't been able to afford citizenship. If the school stops being available to my siblings, then we have to leave the place we ran to for safety. 

I'm constantly worried that something will come into play that will make my eventual citizenship harder, or more expensive, or entirely unattainable. I personally don't have a lot here other than a boyfriend in another state, and the family I live with, but I don't want to leave. I'd rather attend nursing school here once I can afford it. Not to mention the fact that my family can't help me get a Visa for school due to the cost/living requirements. 

This new president just makes living here a constant worry for us, we never know when something might get put in place that'll wreck the lives we've built here. 

Also, thank you about the names c:

<TEXT> The article was interesting in itself, but I just found myself slightly annoyed that everything is under the blanket title of "creepypasta". 

I've always found Nosleep has it's own separate kind of tales. It's more realistic and immersive in general. Nosleep is nosleep and creepypastas are creepypastas. Not to say that I haven't read some interesting creepypastas before, but I find that you find a lot more terrible quality creepypasta posts than you would nosleep posts. Just two separate entities IMO. 

Random rant ended. 

It's super cool that you got to be interviewed though! That must have been an interesting experience c:  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I barely even know my issues other than anxiety andbbeing depressed for 5+ years.  I'm not sure if I'm even coping, the only thing that really keeps me from entirely lashing out and going off the wall is the fact that I'm afraid of other people knowing too much. 

I guess my coping method is to generally not trust more than one person at a time, and when I feel the need to express my shitty memories I either talk to that one person, or attempt to incorporate it into a drawing/painting/story/etc. 

Even if I was to share, we're now in the age of mental illness being a joke. The fact that I'm young makes me less believable, makes it more likely that I'm just looking for attention and not actually fucked up by the way I lived for my first 15 years. Everything is just a big joke, and half the people who would consider it a real problem are the type to say, "It's all in your head, get over it." Or "The whole world isn't against you, so just stop thinking like that."

Blah, I feel like I'm ranting and I'm not even sure if I answered what you asked for. I apologize.  </TEXT>

I don't mind the simple stories, but I prefer the super engaging ones that keep you wondering until the very end, whether it be in a single long post, or a series of well thought out and well put together posts. 

Either way, if the story is relatively original, as well as interesting, I'll read it regardless of how simple or complicated the plot is, but I prefer the complicated ones.  </TEXT>

Honestly didn't intend to have it derive from those, though I've seen them both.  I just wanted to create a bioweapon type pandemic that caused disturbing/gruesome deaths and such. 

Was a little sad to see it compared with them because of how extremely grotesque I felt I was going with my symptoms/deaths/murders/suicides.

<TEXT> I actually have no idea why this is so awful. But I'm probably not a really well adjusted person. 

Currently writing something about a cannibal, and it doesn't really freak me out. The act of obtaining the human meat is what I find to be kind of.. Messed up? 

It doesn't really scare me, but I have this internal sense that it's wrong for a human being to rip apart another living person with their teeth. Also, the aspect of preserving a body so that it can be eaten in regular portions seems kind of wrong, there's not really instructions on how well human meat will taste after being frozen, and how long it takes for said meat to spoil. 

I guess that it's only taboo because people are repulsed by it, I personally wouldn't eat a human because I'm a picky eater. 

I have no moral reason why I wouldn't eat a person, I just don't think they'd taste good, and am not great at trying new things.

<TEXT> I think that could damage the voting process, but that there should be some way of stopping bots from downvoting. 

If it's a bot doing it, that's just cruel. 

Maybe they should create a thing where if you've only ever downvoted things from a certain sub, you're no longer allowed to downvote there. 

Also, possibly put in a limit to how many times you can downvote within a certain time frame, so people can't go and downvote every story on the "new" page, or mass downvote every post by one person. 

Another cool idea, if an estimated reading time was calculated based on post length, you shouldn't be able to downvote a story if it hasn't been posted for that length of time yet. 

Or, no downvoting without opening the story, so you can't just vote based off the title/author without at least getting a glimpse of what was written.  

All decent ideas, but I think they'd be super hard for mods to attempt to put in place.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never intend to make things a series, but I end up with 6000+ word posts and still have ideas, and love a twist ending, and twice now my twist has turned into,  "I'm gonna need a second part, this is such a great idea." 

And then I get excited making the second part, and fizzle out during it, or after it, and never think ahead about the length of time between posts. 

With the new one, I wasn't exactly out of ideas or hating the story yet, but the timing didn't give me a lot of time to get things down the way I wanted, and after not updating for a week I felt pressured to put it out faster because I was messing with the timeline of the story by not actually having the real time to put into it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've actually decided to do this with my old series, I recently put up the rewritten second part that I had taken down before for personal reasons, but I only decided on continuing with it because of the anthology piece I began writing, and I needed the second part back up to kind of put it out there that something new is coming. 

This is actually the best idea, because though my second part was never well received, I decided to overlook it because the part I'm working on has a lot of potential and I'm happy that I don't have to directly continue on a story line that I lost hope in, but still get to use the base idea of the first post.  </TEXT>

Not in the sex trade though, that would have been too easy. Hate my second part though. 

I haven't been reading a lot lately though, mine unintentionally follows the trend because I based the beginning off my childhood and my 14 year old friend being taken away was a really plausible happening in that lifestyle.

<TEXT> My hearing and vision blurred as I became increasingly overwhelmed. *What the fuck did I sign?* Why didn't the attendant give me whatever form contained the part with the safe word? They couldn't actually kill my family anyways, right? This is just another test to scare me shitless, and make me try to quit. *It's just a game.* 


I was broken out of my trance with a sharp smack to the back of the head. The fuck are you waiting for, who dies? Sharkman looked at me with a smile of glee on his face. The back of my head throbbed from the fresh contact with my previous wound. 


I groaned as I ran my hand over the spot, and thought quickly over my options. Treating this as the game it was would be the best option, not giving this sadistic shark freak the satisfaction of freaking me out. Fake or not, Claire would be pissed if I let her die. I looked at them both on the table, and saw my father nod at me with tear filled eyes. It tugged at my heartstrings, either he was playing along really well, or he honestly thought he was going to die here. 


I was once again conflicted about what was real here, but the Sharkman began counting down from three. As he reached one the gun stopped on my fianc, and I impulsively yelled, Not her! 


**BANG** 


She screamed through the gag as the shot rang out, and suddenly the inside of my father's skull was strewn across the table. *It's not real, it's not real.* I tried to convince myself as my stomach rolled at the incredibly real looking scene in front of me. I felt hot metal press into my neck as the Sharkman leaned in close to me. 


Let's sit for the show, why don't we? He gave me a sharp toothed grin as he led me to the head of the table and strapped me into a chair. He walked back to the other end of the table and bent down to speak quietly to the Behemoth. He stood back up and held my fiancs face down into the gore on the table. I sat completely stunned as I noticed the headless body begin to rock against the table. 


What the fuck are you doing! I screamed in disgust. I was met with a sharp pain in my shoulder, which I registered as a gunshot wound a minute later. The Sharkman sneered at me, gun still raised. 


Shut the fuck up. And watch. The. SHOW! He laughed hysterically at that, and pressed the gun against Claire's temple. Moments later she began screaming as the Behemoth took his turn on her, I couldn't convince myself that this part was fake, and couldn't stop myself from throwing up directly into my lap. I was filled with disgust and anguish, Claire looked directly at me as she tried to scream for it to end. 


My vision started to blur from both the shock of scene and the blood loss from my new wound. I blacked out. 


I was awoken by the screaming again, but I couldn't see. They had blindfolded me. I could tell I was outside, everything smelled like grass and there was a cool breeze. My hands were bound behind me, and my wounds ached. Claire's screaming was distant, and I had no idea what was happening. I heard footsteps approach, and then the voice of the Sharkman. 


You're nearly done, bitch. Things just need to get a little more interesting if you want us to actually let you go at the end of the night.


((Wasn't 100% sure where to go to bring it closer to the end while still keeping up with everyone's additions, but hopefully most of this is decent))

<TITLE> Missing Post, Population Control (Part 2) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-07 12:18:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **We have worked hard to cover this all up, but I can no longer be a part of this. She wasn't crazy, everything she told you was true. They removed this, but I found it. I've been working here for a while now, and I recently realized that I needed to learn more about what I was working on. That's a later story though. You may have read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/545jly/population_control/) account of events some time ago, below lies the rest of the information our patient could learn and share. I'm sorry for all of this, I'll explain more later, but this really needs to stop being covered up. Here was the update we never wanted you to see:**



The past few days have been eye-opening, to say the least. I know more than I want to, I know too much about myself now, and I know more than I can tell you, even though I still cant find key information about the people who did this. I can say this will likely be the only update you will receive from me, I dont expect to be able to come back after today, or for any of you to want me to. The last time I was able to access one of the computers to update you all was just before the last round of testing. For those of you who didnt see my smaller updates and background information that I left in the comments, heres a bit of that for you before I go into detail about what Ive learned over the past few days. 



The town was in the Yukon Territory of Canada, very near the border of Alaska. I honestly dont know a lot about it or its location in relation to other places. Small town, small school, and a pretty small world for those of us in the town. Ive never been anywhere outside of it, except perhaps this lab. It really isnt important now that I know how large this operation is. I still have no idea where this facility is. As I said in comments, I cant locate a single window in the facility. I have no sense of time here, everything is on their set schedule which may not even be following regular daylight patterns. 



As far as the testing goes, Im not entirely sure what it was all about. Until the past few days, I had never seen any of the 8 other survivors. I still havent figured out who exactly is running this operation, but I know its been running for far longer than Id imagined. In the beginning months of the testing, they seemed to be just checking vitals. I was in bed for days at a time with an IV attached to me, and they took a lot of blood samples. I thought at that point they were just making sure I was clear of any signs of infection. After that, every few weeks I would receive an injection or several, and then I would sleep while they observed whatever those injections did. After the testing I felt sick for days, like there were insects burrowing in my stomach and bones. The most recent ones were more blood tests and injections, but this time I was awake, and I really dont think theyre happy about that. Ill tell you about that after the more important things.



Here we go, I hope you dont blame me after all this. There are things my body physically wont allow me to write. I didnt see until after posting that when writing out certain telltale information in the file I saw, I censored myself. Ive tried to go back and edit it, but whether it is my brain or my hands, my body will absolutely not fill in those blanks with real information. I know why now, but youll find out yourself as I tell you what Ive discovered. 




Through memorizing the passwords of different computers Ive been able to get access to in the facility, Ive found out that the event which happened in E.S (my town) started long before the three weeks of hell I experienced there. Obviously due to the computers and my own bodys restrictions I cannot disclose exact specifics, or show you the files, but I promise to do my best. Ill tell it to you chronologically, as well as I could piece it together. Other than E.S I couldnt find specific locations, but I can guarantee this has happened or will occur in at least 19 other places. I wish I knew where they were. 



As far as I could find this began thirty years ago. The scientists working here had completed an outline for how to control the population in the years to come. They knew it was a growing problem, that the world would eventually begin to die from the lack of resources in an exponentially growing population. I really apologize for being unable to go into the specifics of this, but maybe someone can figure out the science to it all. They created some type of genome, or at least I think thats what it was called in the files. My mind gets so foggy when I try to think of the details. Anyways, they used this in some type of solution so that it could be implanted, Ill refer to it as the Crystal serum for the sake of clarity. 



The implantations occurred every five years, the first set being given in 1986. In five different locations, which were not listed in the files, they injected ten newborn infants with the crystal serum. This would have been the first of their trials, all of which were 100% failures. According to the data I found, each child died without infecting anyone else. The results were disgusting. None of the mothers were aware that their children had been injected with anything, it had all seemed like routine post-labour checkups and blood tests. Within 24-hours of injection symptoms began to show, small crystallizations formed in a film over the skin of each child. By the 48-hour mark the entire epidermis of each child was made of a putrid green crystal, but that was as far as the symptoms went. They were not infectious, they did not have violent outbursts, but they did die. Every time one of the children were touched, the crystals flaked away and revealed raw muscle and tissue, each movement of the children caused cracks along the crystals which bled with no way to stop them without tearing away more of the crystallized skin. 




Each child from that trial died. According to the research all those children suffered greatly. Their crystallized skin was painfully detached from their bodies, by accident and as other doctors tried to save them. Every attempt at grafting new skin became more crystallizations. Their small bodies couldnt take it, some died of heart failure, organ failure, and major immune issues due to the crystal serum, others died due to blood loss. They were unable to do anything to save those children, they couldnt even identify what was wrong. The data says that the serum is untraceable through any medical technology, so no one ever knew what had happened those two days in any of those locations. I dont know how a story like that was covered up, all I know is that the mothers were told that an infectious disease spread through newborns specifically and took those fifty lives. Trial 1: 100% failure, noninfectious, 100% host death rate. 




The second trial was 1991. The research didnt specify as to whether or not they change the formula for the crystal serum, but they decided to try a different host subject. This round of injections was given to mothers a month before they were due to give birth. Passed off as a simple prenatal injection to assure the health of the child during the last stage of pregnancy, once again these women were clueless to being experimented on. Those women all fell ill and died within a week of their implantations. They were said to show minor symptoms of crystallizations around their eyes, and their fetuses had no chance of survival. The wombs of the women in the second trial were filled with disgusting masses of flesh and green crystal protrusions, not enough to pierce the mother, but to such an extent that they werent even discernable as human. The file called this positive progress, and said that they were close to developing a serum with correct results. Trial 2: 100% failure, noninfectious, promising results in post mortem tests, 100% host death rate, attributes similar to expectations for Beta stage of implanted hosts.




The third trial occurred in 1996 with results better than ever expected with only minor tweaks to the serum and implantation method. My town was one of five to be impacted by this set of research. They implanted the serum in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy, in a smaller dose, and more directed at the fetus. There were no side effects on any of the mothers. Most of the children made it full term, and those who didnt were naturally miscarried and showed no signs of the side effects the serum could cause. Each child was born seemingly normal, each mother was fine, it was as though the crystal serum had never entered their lives. The file suggests about the same success rates in every location, between 95%-100% fatality in non-host subjects. Im unable to say how many host-subjects survived due to my limitations. 




Trial number three was described as a time released serum that would meld into the DNA of the host subjects, with zero side effects to host. Hosts would have a predisposition to be secretive and wary of others, an advanced sense of danger, and above average intelligence compared to their peers. The hosts would be unable to divulge class-A confidential information when exposed to such, and have generally heightened immune system responses. They will be immune to toxins, airborne or otherwise. The Alpha stage occurs at the time when every host reaches full maturity they will simultaneously release undetectable airborne toxins into a 100 mile radius, at which point any exposed person(s) will also become infectious. The release of toxins should last for approximately two weeks, with up to two additional weeks for the the airborne virus to dissipate. 




The Beta stage would be what I described in my original account of events. The infections, crystallizations, gruesome deaths and all. They cleaned out the bodies in the town for further testing. I never had a chance of dying, I am not even entirely human. I dont know what I am. I am part of the cause of all this death. There were only nine hosts in my town, but it was more than enough to kill over 400 people. Since learning all this Ive realized more about the testing being done on me and the others. Ive also been unable to locate more specific files on what is currently going on. I can definitely say that somewhere out there, theres four other locations that had or will have their hosts become fully mature and release the crystal serum infection sometime this year. I dont know what they consider fully mature, but obviously it can be as young as 19-years-old, but it seems its just about 20 years after the initial implantation. Perhaps its the serum that is maturing.



I also know that there was at least a fourth trial in 2001, but the means of implantation and results were not listed in any of the files I found. I dont doubt that theyll continue this research, or that they have and I just havent located the files yet. As for the files on my town, I cant find the detailed ones that would tell what exactly their objective is with the Beta stage. I feel like were well past that part now and theyre working on something even worse with us.




The tests they were doing on us initially were to see if we were still releasing toxins. They were checking the levels of whatever chemicals the crystal serum had left in us. They were checking to see if wed suddenly develop symptoms, and then if we could be provoked to develop symptoms. I think theyre trying to see if we can be made into weapons, more so than we already are. Four of my fellow hosts have died during the testing, I have no idea what these so-called scientists did to cause that. I only saw the others briefly after I woke up during my testing. Ill get to that now.



Usually when they take me in for testing, its a blood draw, followed by some type of sedation and then everything is black. That last time the sedation didnt work though, whether Im developing a tolerance to it, or they made a mistake in dosage I do not know. I know that when I opened my eyes to a brightly lit room, I found myself squinting in confusion. I had no fingers for a moment, only jagged, green, crystalline claws. They didnt notice I was awake until I screamed, and then they ran for me. Its a hazy memory of half sedation, but I know I had sharp enough crystal protrusions along my arms that I ripped through restraints. All I saw was green glass, and blood. My skin was being torn open where the jagged green malformations were piercing through. The more confused and scared I became, the worse they got. My blurry vision began to have a tint of green, and as a scientist came towards me I lashed out with my hand to ward them off. My panicked movement caused my jagged claw to elongate, and I severed the hand that was reaching before me. I was screaming in horror once again, when I felt a pinch and began to lay back and calm down. 



I felt the jagged crystals recede beneath my skin, it felt like glass cutting through me, and then maggots writhing deep through my tissue and into my bones. They restrained me again and I was being rolled through the blank white halls on a bed, I passed by several rooms where I saw some other people my age from my town through observation glass, they were all asleep and in various stages of crystallization as the researchers monitored and took notes at their bedside. In one room I passed I saw an entirely crystallized person laying misshapen on the floor. There were several obvious bullet holes in what was once a normal person's body. And so much blood, so much more blood than Id seen since the event was in full force. I saw that there were several researchers tending to wounds in the room, and someone else was being rolled out on a bed covered in a blood soaked sheet. The sedation made me fall into slumber at that point.



Apparently if we get too out of hand in testing, were done with. The crystalline person I saw while being rushed out of my observation room was the fourth to be terminated according to the files. I was lucky I didnt cause lethal damage or Id be gone too. I need to get out of here, I dont want to become the thing I saw one of my fellow hosts become. It feels like a constant fire is under my skin, my blood is full of shattered glass that may burst through at any moment. Im not safe here. Im a monster hidden in human skin, and I dont know how many of me are out there unknowing yet. Remember the characteristics, think about yourself. Think about your life, think about your age and the tests. Keep yourself far away from others if you might be one of us, because were dangerous. Were more than population control, I dont know what these tests are, but theyre going to make us more lethal. Theyre going to make the future hosts even worse. 



I am not human. I never was. I dont know what I am, but a host for something deadly. I dont know if these tests have made it so I will be infectious again. I know that I cant control the crystallizations when they appear. I know my emotions can trigger terrifyingly deadly reactions from them. I know they hurt. I dont know if I can escape. But one way or another, tonight Im going to find the medication that provokes the transformations, or learn how to trigger them on my own. Tonight Im getting rid of the other hosts in this facility. Tonight this place is going to be done with, I will be gone one way or another. I will find the other facilities somehow. They may have created me so that I cant focus on the information I need to find them, but Ill be looking. I know too much to let this go on. Im sorry if I spread this on my way to stopping it. Im sorry if youre a host. Im sorry that they turned us into monsters. Im sorry Ill never be what I expected, but I am more now.



The population needs to be controlled, and right now Im going to start with ones trying to do it themselves. 


**I don't know how far she got with her plan, I did hear of some major damage in one sector a few months back, but I'm unsure at this time if that is related to her. My name is Madison, and I'll be back to tell you the truth.**

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I figured I was in front of the three people once again when the quiet whimpers of the wounded female sounded to be just a few feet in front of me. I tried to recall what the other two looked like, but I had only gotten a glimpse of them before the lights went out. A male to the left, and another girl to the right. The fake bullet wound had kept my attention too long to really look them over. They were all bare anyways, so I doubted I missed any important details. 

I knew what the people running this little show wanted, I was basically playing a character in a horror movie. I wouldn't be a damn bit surprised if this was recorded and posted somewhere afterwards. See how the main character flinches at the unspeakable acts that his tormentors forced him to commit. Fucking lame.


I didn't really feel like playing *directly* into their bullshit though. Normally, the main character, being a good guy, would go for the already wounded person. Be all merciful and stay as innocent as possible. But where's the thrill in that? This was supposed to be scary, not some cliche movie plot. I sidestepped to the left, until I was in front of where I assumed the guy was. I was going to throw them off, to whatever extent I could. I paid for some high quality terrifying enjoyment.


Not gonna give me a look at my choice? I yelled aloud into the room. I was met with only increased sobbing coming from the girl again. It was getting on my nerves. Do you want a fucking gold star? Jesus, quit it already, you're not impressing anyone! 


She was a little more silent after that, but I could still hear her. Whatever, I took an aggravated step forward and leaned towards my victim's face. I could feel his heavy breathing, and was slightly disgusted and the stench of his breath. I guess I might have made a displeased noise, because from the darkness in front of me I heard, Fuck you.


Well then, With irritation rolling through me, I raised my arm and quickly slammed the knife into roughly where his shoulder should be. An aggressive yell from the man was quickly cut short by my own scream of pain. The dirty bastard bit my arm. This sparked newfound rage in me, so I ripped the knife out from whatever padding and blood pouches I had punctured, and drove it forcefully into where I figured his gut was. I had definitely hit more blood pouches, but the bite had pissed me off, so I was hoping the force of my blows could be felt through whatever protective padding he had on. 


Suddenly my forehead was bursting with pain, and I was falling backwards off a ledge that I was fairly sure I hadn't climbed up to get here. It felt like a long drop, but instead of thinking about that as I fell, I was thinking about how that actor was *such a dick.* 


Suddenly my back hit concrete, followed closely by the back of my skull. I reached back to feel the point of impact, and was met with a warm, sticky sensation. I found myself getting angry, but also slightly worried. I was *actually* bleeding, and probably had a concussion. I looked up to see how far I had fallen. A light flickered on from far above as I squinted upwards, I appeared to have fallen at least sixty feet down a square shaped hole. There's no possible way I fell that far though, I didn't hit the ground hard enough or fall for a long enough period of time to travel that distance. Must have been a wicked optical illusion. 


The light above flickered off then on again, and I could see the robed figures standing around the edge of the hole looking down towards me. As the light blinked in and out they disappeared and reappeared, then suddenly the flickering stopped, and I watched as something came barreling down towards me. I pressed my body tightly to the wall, and instinctively squeezed my eyes shut as the large object hit the ground with a sickening crack. When I reopened my eyes it was pitch dark once again. 


Annoyed as ever, I felt along the walls and found my initial observation was correct. 8 by 8 square room with no doors. How creative. Wow, dark room with no doors! Haven't seen this one yet, I yelled up the hole. The sound didn't echo though, as though the shaft I had fallen down was now closed. I sighed and got down on my knees to feel about the floor and discover what my robed friends had tossed me. It was a body, of course. I couldn't tell much about the fake body, except that I could feel skin, and I was kneeling in fake blood. The skin felt really realistic though. 


That's when the light flicked back on, but this time much closer. The hole above was gone, and a ceiling with a small light fixture was now in it's place. I looked over the body, and it appeared to be my victim. The body had landed face up, a stab wound was in the shoulder as well as several to the abdomen. They looked really realistic, and so did the bones which were broken and out of place from the fall. This was some hell of a prop. The bag tied around the head was leaking fake blood, so I decided to remove it. I was met with an extremely human looking face, half of which was crushed.


It made me feel a little uneasy, but I laughed anyways, Think you can fool me? 


I wavered a bit at the end, as I glanced back at the almost too-lifelike dead man. Of course the lights turned out again, but this time I was met with deafeningly loud eerie laughter from all sides. 


((Edit me like crazy if you wish, for anything that helps it flow better with everything else, not the greatest at dialogue. Also, sorry that I write so fast, couldn't sleep and had ideas in advance.))

<TEXT> These are really interesting. Having dealt with seeing severe trauma firsthand I don't find them scary, but fascinating. 

It'd be awesome if you could ask your dad for more background information on the cases that you know of, so that you could give a longer story for each patient. I zoomed right through reading this, so if you could ask for more information about what happened to them, how they were fixed, what caused their injuries, how long they were there, and any other information you can receive without going into specifics about the identity of patients, then you could put in less stories per post, and slow down how quickly your posts are read all the way through. If you update this post with additional information, or make another post, let me know! I'd love to hear more.  </TEXT>

* REC (all three were good, not sure of they're still on because this was a few years ago) 

* V/H/S 1 2 (hated 3) 

* Shrooms

* Silent Hill: Revelations (I think? Second silent hill movie though) 

Can't think of others that I actually enjoyed at the moment, though I found a Google search of "found footage horror movies" turns up some of the best and worst of that specific horror genre c: 

Oh edit:
I recently watched these on a *totally legal* site . 

Ouija: Origin of Evil (prequel to Ouija that came out sometime in the past two years? Not bad, but I'd recommend watching it BEFORE Ouija, as it is slow for a majority but provides interesting background to the first movie, which IMO was the better film of the two) 

Don't Breathe (Some young adults break in to rob a blind war vet, who happens to end up being very sinister) I found it more thriller than horror, but it was pretty decent. 

Speaking of Sinister, I recall that I didn't hate that movie when I saw it, though for the life of me I can't remember what it was about since I watch horror quite often. Think there's a second one to that, but haven't seen it. 

Older, but there was a remake of The Amityville Horror sometime between 2004-2006 that was actually quite good. Scared the shit outta me when I was 6.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The REC movies (not sure if all of them)  were made into the Quarantine movies, so instead of Spanish or whatever it is, it's English. I don't remember if they're intentional remakes or just coincidentally exactly alike, but they're good. REC 3 was great, never checked if they made a Quarantine 3, but the first two were good c: Last time I checked REC 3 is on Netflix, wedding turned zombie apocalypse!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This sounds similar to a movie I saw, Ghost something. Film crew trying to fake a paranormal investigation TV show go to this abandoned hospital? Asylum perhaps? Can't recall. But they were going to rig up fake scares for the show, and end up being murdered by ghosts and such. Including a ghost on human rape scene. 

Can't remember it all, or the actual name. But it's a similar premise with the whole "Fake paranormal hunting turned into actual death". </TEXT>

Now I've cut it down to where I can have one or two cups in the morning, take a nap, maybe have another one after, and then pop and/or tea for the rest of the day. Just general desire for caffeine constantly. 

Though my daily schedule is odd, go to sleep between 1-4am to be awake at 5am, depending on what I have to do during the day, I could nap between 8-12 but I usually am up til 10 and awake again in under two hours.

My sleep schedule is all sorts of odd, to the point that caffeine doesn't really cut it, I have fallen asleep before on the floor with a quarter can of Monster in my hand.  </TEXT>

Two specifically made my day 

"Well damn Dad"

And a little comment chain where someone asked in the end of the comment how to make their children always honest. Have to find the link for it, much better without my crappy summary. 


Edit: 

Here's the comment because I don't know how to link the comment specifically : 

I mean, wow, and all that. But how did you get them to be honest? I guess maybe you aren't the best person to get parenting tips from but... with a 6 and 3 year old at home I'd love to know who actually colored on the walls last night. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find that if I try to plan a story, it takes forever. I've had one sitting on the sidelines for over a month because I keep getting ideas to add to it, and put them in a little mental checklist, but then end up over thinking when I feel like writing, and just start a new story. The few I've put out there took about five hours each including editing. I just sat down with a vague idea of beginning middle and end, and wrote whatever came to mind. They didn't turn out too bad, I really liked them. Though when trying to expand one of these into a series and trying to plot out where to take it, I entirely psyched myself out over how well the first part did compared to the second, and scrapped the idea, with a part three sitting as a draft somewhere to wrap things up. I just can't organize my thoughts enough to get back to it. I've never actually plotted out a plan for my stories, they're not super stars, but they haven't been total garbage so far.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the post with the doc was stickied it would be easy to find for those interested, but if not, a separate sub could be useful. A master post that either shows the current stats, daily/hourly/howeveryoupdate and then new posts for when additional statistics are added to the entirety of your project, for example (Update: Now includes most common up vote hours). Or just periodic posts about how the statistics change. Master post for all time statistics, weekly posts to alert that the master post has changed, and/or statistics for that week. Things like that. A sub would give you more freedom to display old drafts of your statistics with new ones, and to use your statistics on both large and small scale data (all time, yearly, weekly), without having to link a bunch of different spread sheets and such.

<TITLE> My Children Never Lied </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-24 06:25:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I always raised my kids to tell the truth. They needed structure in their lives, and I needed peace of mind in mine. You see, during the birth of the twins the doctors couldn't save Amelia. Complications, blood loss and such, I try not to think of the actual details too much, it always causes me to feel hatred for the doctors who couldn't save her. I blamed them for it all. I never blamed my two beautiful girls though, they were a blessing and the legacy of my wife. I raised them on the beliefs that Amelia had held so dearly, honesty, courage, the willingness to learn and discover new things, and the strength to stand up for their own beliefs. 

I knew I had taught them well. Whenever a problem arose they came to me, they told me the truth of what was going on in their lives. They told me of arguments with other school children, and admitted when they had committed actions that were wrong. They never lied at all. I made sure they knew how valuable it was to be honest and trustworthy, how much they embodied the soul of their mother, and how she would be proud of anything they did so long as they were truthful in doing so. 

They were so young, they could barely grasp the entire concept of all the reasons I praised their honesty, but they felt good about themselves knowing that their words always held true and couldn't be disproven. They came to the point where they honestly couldn't tell a lie, they didn't know how to conceive a story in their minds to cover up the truth of something. I mean of course, at times it caused minor issues, they seemed like the sort who couldn't keep a secret. They could to a point, but they couldn't outright lie or try to deceive when asked. They were the most honest little girls you'd ever meet. 

There also came times when the girls were a bit older and would be with friends who were of a troublesome sort, and they were always honest to the parents about what had happened. This led to untrusting parents who thought their own children wouldn't lie to them, and untrusting children who detested my little girls for their outright honesty. I always stood up for my kids, I did whatever I could to prove how pure and honest they were. It took a while, but I think after all the things the girls have experienced lately, that the people of our town finally believe that my children were entirely honest. 

It all started just after the girl's thirteenth birthday. They had gone to a friend's house one weekend, and come home terrified. Apparently they had been watching a series of horror movies, which was something my daughters rarely were interested in doing, but their friends at the sleepover insisted upon having a little marathon. Sure, the girls had seen scary movies in the past, and spent a few days paranoid about the content and that it could be true, but in the past I had been able to ease their fears by disproving the existence of whatever it was they feared. This time was an exception.

After a few days with no alteration to their terror, Marissa and Claire came to me hoping to further explain. Not only had they been watching the movies, but a specific one in general had piqued their interest. The film had been about a man who appeared to people as a silhouette, almost a black shadow of a person, and once you saw this man you, or someone close to you was fated to die. Apparently the girls had gone into their own attempts at disproving the existence of this man, and had failed. They had only found more evidence, videos, stories of encounters. Everything seemed so true, and they couldnt prove any of it wrong. I reassured them that I would find a way to show them that this wasnt real, but no matter what I searched and looked for, I found myself becoming curious at how all the recounts of this entity seemed so true. Everyone who gave true names for those killed by this man seemed to be telling the truth. There were accurate obituaries matching the details of the stories, some of which were not public until after the encounters were released. I even found that some authors who had seen the man were later found dead.

The girls knew I was coming up with blanks in disproving the reality of this entity, and suddenly their reputation began going downhill. They couldnt stop talking about the stories, and how they were real, and how they were afraid that it could happen to someone they knew. Their classmates laughed at them, school officials thought they were being childish and silly, and they began to get in trouble for their adamant belief in something they had never seen in real life. They were losing their record of being honest, and it was causing people to think that my boasting of the girls amazing morals was false all along. I had to revamp my efforts to fix their reputation, my daughters never lied. 

A few weeks later they began telling disturbing tales. They told me that they had started seeing the man in the middle of the night, standing in the shadows of their room. It got progressively worse from there, every few days they would have another encounter. The man hovering in the shadows, watching them with eyes they couldnt see. Whispers next to their beds in the night, saying that he was coming for them. I put a voice recorder on the bedside table between Claire and Marissa. It recorded low, raspy whispers which threatened the lives of my children, beckoned for them to wake up, and told them not to run. I allowed the girls to have this, to prove to people they were not lying, and I researched the entity they were facing with renewed worry for the girls.

The people of the town still werent believing the story they told, even with the proof right there. I could find no one in town who was willing to help my daughters, they were branded as liars. Everyone thought they faked the recordings, and that they were just trying to scare the friends who had initially introduced the girls to the idea of the shadowy man. I upped my efforts once again, and it was the last I would ever do for them.

I woke up one morning after a long night of researching the stories of what happened to the people who had faced the entity, no good endings. The house was quite, an odd thing because it was a weekday and the girls were normally awake before me to prepare for school. I walked into their room and saw the most horrifying sight Id ever experienced. Blood and gore splattered their beds and walls, my two little angels were cut from ear to ear. Dead. I called the police, I cursed everyone for not believing them, for not helping them. That was just this morning, but it feels a thousand years away. 

My love for them knew no bounds, and I would have done anything to save them from a dishonest life. My children never lied. They saw a man in their room, they heard a voice whispering to them, even on the night they were murdered. Im running out of time to prove once and for all that they were honest until the moment of death.

I tried so hard, I lost so much sleep trying to help them. I stood in the shadows wearing a mask for hours at a time, waiting for them to see the figure they were convinced was real. I hid under beds and whispered terrifying words, I broke lightbulbs so that they couldnt turn them on and ruin the effect of the dark silhouette. I ended them in the height of their belief, just to show everyone that they really were being honest about the danger they faced. I made one error, one that is having me sent down to the police station to answer questions I was not prepared for. Telling you this before I go has helped me figure it out though.

My children never lied, and all the proof to the stories they told lay in a voice recorder I had forgotten was turned on during the last night they were alive. There was a man in their room. There was whispering under the bed. There was the sound of muffled gurgling as they tried to speak through the deep gashes laid into the flesh of their throats, and then there was the sound of their father crying and apologizing, and telling them that he would make sure that everyone knew that they had never lied.

Her face was full of surprise, adoration, and relief. She quickly leaned out the door and beckoned to someone, and seconds later my wonderful, amazing Anisa came running into the room. It was a day filled with tears, joy, and laughter. Quite possibly the happiest day of my life.

Its been three months since then, Im back at my old place of work, with a promotion and a pay raise. My family is happy, my daughter and wife have never looked so beautiful. I cherish every moment with them. I could almost write off everything that had happened to me as some type of horrifying comatose dream, but every day I see people in the corner of my eye who have faces like that of the Torturer. Some of them I know, many I see and suddenly their name pops into my mind. Everytime I see one of these mutilated, disgusting, disfigured faces, I write down the name that pops into my head. These are the faces of true sinners. Every so often, I run into Nachstern at a crossroads, where I hand him a list. I still see Francis on the bus often, he has been helpful in becoming accustomed to my new role in the world.

Everything is okay now, for me at least. All I can say, is I hope if I ever see one of you who have read this, is that your true face is the one you see in the mirror. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ((part two due to character limit))

I stood less than a foot away from her when I stopped and met her eyes. She was amazing, still fully nude and appearing like the first time we had ever fallen into bed together. I longed to touch her skin, and as the thought appeared in my mind, she smirked. The facade broke for me there. The woman I loved was astoundingly beautiful, but always self conscious. I knew I was seeing an illusion of my Elizabeth. She reached out to me, and I swatted her hand away. She scowled. I willed myself to look past the illusion, but the appearance of my wife did not waver. She tried to seduce me, and I resisted with a will I didnt know I contained. That was when this Demoness decided to begin the real torture. 

She screamed at me in my darlings voice. Blamed me for the death of our daughter, for the fact that she was trapped in eternal servitude to a Demon. She described in detail vile acts in which she had to perform for him, sexual favors, self mutilation, seduction of men and women who became victims she was forced to torture and mutilate to entertain her master. It pulled at my heart slightly, but I couldnt let go of the fact that this creature was not my wife. This was the Torturer, a liar, even if it was the truth this Demoness meant only to hurt me in any way possible. I withstood it all, my will was entirely made of steel at this point. I tried blocking out her voice, and my head was filled with screams. The screams of my daughter as she was murdered. I closed my eyes, and my head was filled with awful visions of her being mutilated in my own home.

I took a deep breath, and smiled to myself. Perhaps if I got through this, I could save them. It felt like years of this torture went on before the creature noticed my grin. The face of my love melted into that of a terrifying mutilated monster. Rotting flesh dripped from jagged, malformed bones, and the stench of death emanated from the Demoness. She shrieked at me, and told me I was Damned for not having any compassion for those I should have cared the most about. I was suddenly chained, the bonds had appeared from nowhere and I was suspended on a wall I had not been up against moments before. The Demoness raked me with claws, my flesh returned and she peeled it off with every tool that existed. Over and over  my skin regenerated, and she mutilated me in every way imaginable for eternities. Cuts, burns, poisons, I lost count of what was being done to me. I laughed hysterically, You think you can make any pain imaginable equate to the pain I lived with before I came here?

She grew bored with me. I watched as the forms of my wife and daughter appeared, and sang softly to myself as I witnessed them brutalized and slaughtered in front of me time and time again. The Demoness finally gave up with these tactics, and returned to the form of the Goddess she had been when I first gazed upon her. I was released from my bindings, and I went to kneel at her feet. I pity you, Demoness. Condemned to punish for eternities, even to those who dont deserve the things you do. A mind filled with such sinful evils, some such evils which you punish others for. You cant even show your true form, are you ashamed of it so much? Or is it simply not satisfying to live an existence where you are only feared for how despicable your true face has become, so you must put on an illusion to recall the feeling of actually being wanted? Its sad to see that you are nothing but a lowly servant of the one who truly passes judgement, a mindless, pathetic little tool to be used to carry out the dirty work, with no true reward to you. I smirked at that, her face seemed taken aback for a moment. 

I am no tool, she sneered at me, I will bring you to Sir Morningstar, and show you what the true face of fear is. A rope appeared around my neck, and she led me deeper into the pit of despair, towards the source of the undying heat. He cares for me, and only me, she spoke softly as I trailed along behind her, down a jagged stone stairwell, If he didnt, I wouldnt have the means to condemn him to a mortal life. I pondered over that as we continued deeper into the depths of Hell. The heat intensified, something I didnt think was possible. 

What happens if he was to become mortal? I questioned, not entirely sure if she planned on sharing more. 

Well, youll never live to see it once he gets his hands on you, but if I was to Damn him to humanity, then the highest ranking of the Greater Demons would consume his place, take on his identity and memories, and the Morningstar we know now would live as a human until his death, then being sent unto purgatory, never to return. She smiled at that, as though it was a peaceful thought for her.

Would you become Morningstar? I asked. She scowled at me with distaste, and yanked the rope forward so I stumbled down the stairs. I choked as she pulled me up by the rope and leaned close to my face. She tilted her head to the side, as though in deep in thought,

No, that would be Nachstern. I am the Torturer. I remain as I am. Though this Morningstar has become corrupt, wasting my time upon people like you who dont deserve to be treated by my talents. He lacks the vision to see true sin these days. I got back onto my feet as she continued with our descent. 

We came upon a grand hall, lit with lanterns of blue flame, the ceiling was not visible, and our steps echoed through the cavernous space as we walked along a path of tall, black, stone pillars. As I had become accustomed to, something appeared out of the darkness as we approached. A great throne, fit for a king, stood ahead of us. A man in a black tailored suit sat in the chair, he was abnormally tall. Even sitting I could tell that he was nearly ten feet, broad shouldered, and astoundingly handsome. He scowled as we approached. Why do you bring this soul upon me? He spoke in a booming voice that shook me to my core.

I was sent by Nachstern, you are to supply me with the means to redemption, and return me to the mortal world. I spoke loudly, and did not waiver. I knew what needed to be done. He laughed, and the entire room shook. I was suddenly brought to my knees by the sound of millions of agonized screams in my head. 

You think I would offer you redemption! He bellowed. You belong here, with the rest of the Damned. You are a sinner who deserves nothing but punishment, this is my judgement, and so it shall be. He glared at the Demoness who still held me on a leash, Why have you not cursed his soul to eternal Damnation? She seemed surprised, and slightly disgusted. 

This soul does not belong here, he is a man of judgement, and there is no punishment to break his soul. 

You useless pawn! Rocks began to fall from the volume of his voice echoing through the cavern. He began to grow larger, the seams of his expensive suit split apart as his body reformed into the disgusting creature I recalled from the vision Id had at the crossroads. The putrid scent of decaying corpses began to weigh down the air, I tried to shallow my breathing. I could taste vile, rotted flesh on my tongue. His soul is Damned. Only I may pass judgement. Sudden footsteps from behind us made me glance back, only to see Nachstern approaching the scene. The Demoness smiled. 

My dear Morningstar, you are not to pass judgement alone. You are unfit for it. I heard whispers all around me, which turned to howls and shrieks.The room shook, more debris began to fall, and Nachstern continued to approach. I looked at the Morningstar, his face was filled with rage. I could no longer hear their discussion, only screams in my head as the shaking intensified. There was a sudden flash of blue light from the direction of the Torturer, and then I was struck with a large piece of falling rock. Everything went black.

I started to become conscious and felt that I was in a bed, I was awash with relief. Before I could open my eyes, I heard a voice in my head. Mr. Cole, the new Morningstar has arisen. The life you knew is not the same as the one you are about to open your eyes to. You will see in your fellow man the faces of true sin, but you will finally receive what you deserve. Good luck in your new life. The voice of Francis faded away, and I opened my eyes to a brightly lit hospital room. In the chair next to my bedside sat Mr. Nachstern.

Good morning Mr. Cole! He exclaimed pleasantly, Now we only have a moment before dear Lizzy returns, but I need to let you in on some things about your newfound life. You have fulfilled the terms of your debt and shall be reward as such. According to everyone here, the night you were fired you suffered a brain aneurysm and have been in a coma ever since. All the memories you have of the events which occurred after our meeting at the crossroads did not occur. I will apologize, you are a man free of sin, and you had to face great hardship to have the strength to play the role that you did, and to become my aid in the passing of judgement upon your fellow humans. He  smiled before continuing, 

In an interesting turn of events, the company you were working for was taken into new ownership. These new owners did not approve of the shady business going on, and luckily ended up with your work in their hands, and have since fixed the corruption in your office. Im sure theyd be glad to have such an adept employee back on their payroll, considering the downsizing in staff they have done to remove the parties at fault. I think that about sums up the need-to-know information. Well be in touch. He walked out of the room, and as soon as he was out the door my beautiful wife entered.

<TEXT> ((Sorry for the delay, took a bit to tweak my ideas to flow with everyone else, and I was a bit late on replying to my turn. This is super long because I thought it made a well wrapped up ending to the story, but feel free to add/remove/replace/change anything to keep the story in tact and such, this is part one because of the character limit for comments))

I fell into a black abyss. I was lost in thoughts and memories for what seemed to be an eternity, memories that brought on questions. I thought of how this all started, how perfect my life had been before I had been fired over doing my job just a little too well. I recalled the wonderful days of playing with my beautiful daughter in the park near our house when she was just learning to walk. Making castles in the sand box, which she loved to destroy as she became an adorably destructive dinosaur. Her first words, first steps, the excitement in her eyes when I came home from a long day at work and could pick her up and spin her around in my arms. I remembered the day I met my lovely Lizzy, how beautiful she was, and how her beauty had been dimmed when I saw her in the office of that Demon. She was still so gorgeous, but it seemed her beauty was laid over an empty shell. I thought back to the day at the crossroads, the day I lost everything. The day I *gave away* everything. What had I gained in that deal?

I was a smart man. I always read the fine print when I signed any contract, I knew when something seemed too good to be true. How could I have not seen it this time? I had made a deal without knowing what the cost was, and what I would receive for making it. What did I gain? I couldnt think of a goddamn thing. Why did I make a deal that I gained nothing for? I screamed into the endless void that I felt myself falling into.

WHAT AM I PAYING FOR!

I felt myself hit the ground hard, my skin felt aflush with a sudden heat. I broke into a sweat, was this hell? My question was answered abruptly. 

No, Mr. Cole, this is not Hell, not quite yet. I turned to the voice and was faced with a tall dark shadow in the distance. Behind him stood tall, black, worn down doors, laden with iron chains. I felt a cold feeling in my chest, and realized the sensation came from my pocket. I pulled out a small piece of paper, which emanated an ice cold sensation that leaked into my heated fingertips. It was the card Francis had given to me. As this realization dawned on me, the card fell to dust, and I returned my gaze to the dark figure before me. Ah yes, the deep voiced boomed, You know me as Francis in the mortal world, but here I am Brother to He who passes judgement upon the sins of man, I am the Keeper of Gates, my name is something your mortal tongue could not speak. I was in awe, how could this be the man I had met on a city bus? 

I felt that the questions I held were of no value now, I was about to discover the truth behind the deal I had made. Yes Mr. Cole, I tried to warn you as I could, but your fate has still brought you to me, and to Him. I must tell you what lies ahead of you. Behind me stand the gates to the realm of the Damned, these gates you shall soon pass, and begin on your final task to reap the rewards you have been longing for.

You will find yourself faced with the one who delves out the punishments, and you must suffer through them, and in return find yourself a way to return your pain unto her. If you can defeat her, and face my brother himself, you may finally receive the reward you have been seeking. If you can stand in the face of judgement, and prove yourself unto him in whichever way he deems fit, you may surpass him, and return to your mortal life. Not the one you once knew, but as one who may pass judgement upon others, see the true face of the wicked mortals of the earth, and seal their fate in the afterlife. Do you understand?

I stood dumbstruck for a moment, but the anxiety and fear that would normally consume me did not arise as I had expected it would. I thought on his words for a moment. Basically, I would be sent through these gates, face possible torture, somehow overcome said torture, face the Devil himself, and possibly find a way to gain his approval and be sent home? It seemed insane, like I was living a nightmare. If I succeeded, what would my life be like? Would I regain my love? Would I be constantly tied to this terrifying place, tasked with deciding which of my fellow humans deserved eternal damnation? Would I gain the wisdom needed to do so? It was quite a lot to handle for my fragile broken mind.

I understand, Mr. Cole, you may feel reservations. As you go through this you shall gain more understanding. You have faced great hardship and loss, this could be your chance at redemption, perhaps even vengeance against the truly sinful souls who have wronged you, you- I cut him off abruptly.

I understand enough, and Im ready. He nodded solemnly, and extended a shadowy hand towards the gates that lay ahead, I started forward. He moved his hand in a sweeping motion, and the large doors began to slowly open, allowing an intense and nearly unbearable heat to seep towards me and sear my skin as I progressed forward. 

Good luck, Mr. Cole. He stood by as I entered the gates, the last thought in my mind was one I had thought often since the day I first met Engel Nachstern, *what else have I got to lose?* Then gates slammed shut behind me. 

I lost all sight. The room before me was sweltering, it felt as though my skin was melting from my bones. My clothes burned into my skin, becoming a disgusting mess of fabric and bubbling flesh. Layers upon layers of skin and muscle were seared away, blood poured from my deteriorating veins, and my nerves were exposed to every sensation possible. Heat, air, and dust particles sent waves of pain vibrating through my body. It was dark as pitch, and I could see nothing in front of me for endless moments as I stumbled forward in agony. Blue flames suddenly lit up the edges of the room, and the light stunned me for a moment. I vaguely wondered how my eyes hadnt melted from their sockets, but I found myself becoming accustomed to the heat. I steeled my resolve, this pain was nothing compared to the night I lost my family. It was merely physical, and would never scar me the way my losses already had. 

I was a mutilated and nearly skeletal figure, trudging forward into the heat of the room. The stench of death and decay surrounded me, and from the center of the darkness, where the dim blue flames could not quite penetrate, appeared a figure I had not been expecting. An ethereal beauty of a woman stood before me, tall with long hair, skin like porcelain, and eyes a deep dark blue of the ocean depths, not to mention completely nude and sporting curves only a goddess could hold. She stared at me inquisitively, head tipped to the side as though inspecting my malformed body, but her gaze was deeper than that, she was peering directly into my mind and soul. In a mere instant I watched the gorgeous creature melt away, and become my dear Elizabeth. I strode towards her, knowing in the back of my mind I was about to face a great test.

I grew even more anxious as I approached the door, well, I was practically pushed to it. I felt the urge to turn and run as far and fast as I could, but I knew that not only would these two goons be able to catch me with ease, I truly needed to give my payment, I owed far too much to escape this. I tried to put a resigned look on my face as we got to the door, Lem looked at me like I was a roach he wished to squash. I glanced over at Piotr, he seemed to have a look of pity as he stared at the wooden door in front of us, the navy blue paint peeling with age. 

I stood a second too long trying to collect myself I suppose, because Lem gave me a sharp jab with his elbow to just below my ribcage. It made my resolve falter a bit as I tried to catch my breath after the blow. "You better get your ass in there, you know He doesn't like to be kept waiting." He smiled at that, and gave me a shove forward as Piotr grabbed the handle and swung the door open for me. I tripped over the lip of the doorway and found myself on my hands and knees in a dark foyer. I heard Lem's laughter behind me, "Already prepared to beg, just how he'd like it." Piotr gave me a disgusted look before he grabbed the door and swung it shut, they remained outside. 

The building seemed cavernous, and empty, but I knew He was there somewhere, waiting for me. I stood and brushed off my clothes, the place was full of dust and cobwebs, as though no one had been here in years. I gently patted my pocket that held Francis' number, knowing that calling him could just end with him being another victim of my debt. Knowing the option was there did strengthen my will slightly, but still I knew there was no leaving here without seeing Him. I began my way through the dim room, the only light seeping through dust caked windows near the entry. My options for travel took me towards a long dark hallway, and a set of stairs next to it that led upwards. Something told me that going upstairs was not where I should be, so I continued down the hallway. As I made my decision on which pathway to take, the space below the door at the end of the hall seemed to illuminate with an eerie orange glow, as though a light had been turned on in the room it hid. I knew I was heading in the right direction.

I sighed as I went towards the door, I could only vaguely recall my last meeting with His people, but I can remember unpleasant details about just before. It's been a while, the scene wasn't as similar. It began in an upper-end neighborhood, at an office-type building you could tell only someone very wealthy could own. It didn't feel uncomfortable to be there, but almost calming. I was confident going in, though I was surrounded by thug-like escorts that time as well. Security comes with being wealthy and having power. I had no idea how much power, I just hoped He could grant me what I wanted, and I was willing to pay anything for it. That wasn't what I most recalled about it though, because you never quite forget a man stumbling from a room screaming in pain, and clasping his shattered, bleeding hands to his chest. I can't imagine if that was his payment, or the result of not paying, and I'm still afraid to find out. At the time all I could think was that the man I was about to see obviously lived a mob-like lifestyle, and was not one to be lightly fucked with. I remember being slightly wary about stepping in the trail of blood the previous client had left in his wake, more out of hoping to make a good impression on the man I was about to see than my own disgust at the blood itself. I was such a confident man as I approached that door, I wish I held the same confidence now.

The dark hallway seemed oppressive, like the walls were closing in around me. My breathing hastened, and dust caught in my throat as I gasped for air, sending me into a coughing fit. My vision went hazy again, I was so close to paying off my debt, and here I was choking for air in a dark corridor. I had to lean against a wall to catch my breath, collect my thoughts, and dry my cheeks of tears that I hadn't realized had escaped. I was truly scared. I calmed myself slightly and took the last few steps to the door. As I reached for the handle, the dim orange glow seemed to vanish. I took another deep breath and steeled myself for what lay behind the door. I closed my eyes as I opened it, I was so cowardly. I opened them only to reveal an immaculate black marble staircase, which wound down into the depths of the building. It once again brought back memories of my first meeting, but I felt no calm feelings as I started down the steps towards the true person who held my debt in his hands. 


((just for clarity, when I flashback I was trying to make it so that the person he initially met was not the same person he is about to encounter, just to stay in context with the last sentence of our awesome captains part, feel free to tweak my details if they're hard to flow with)) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not me, but my stepmother when she was four. She swears on her mother's grave this is true. 

When she was about four, she was sleeping in a room with her aunt on the third floor of the house when she was awoken by tapping on the window. She saw what she calls 'The Man in Black' and the angel of death. Apparently the man, basically just a black sillouhette of a person, was tapping on the window and calling her name. "Michelle, Michelle, open the window and come play with me."

She hid under the covers and fell back asleep eventually, all while the thing at the window called for her to come and play. The next day when she told her mom about it, she said it must have been the neighbor next door walking home with a stuffed cow on his shoulders. Walking home, at like 3am, with a cow big enough to reach a third story window? Ridiculous. A month or so later her Uncle died, hence the beginning in her belief of it being an angel of death. She felt like if she had opened the window it would have pulled her out so that she'd fall to her death. 

To make matters worse, and what helps keeps this memory constantly fresh in her mind, is that when she was a teenager her friend(Ashley for clarity)  saw the same man walking down the street rolling a baby carriage. A few weeks later Ashley's brother's girlfriend miscarried. This added to the belief that it is an angel of death. 

She warns me and all my siblings constantly to avoid at all costs if we ever see anything like this, because it will bring death somehow.

<TEXT> We were given one task. Just one, and we couldn't even do that. 

In the Seelie Court we were considered good. We were the best qualified for the job. All we had to do was retrieve one thing. We Fae are odd creatures to some, we bask in decadence and lust and desire, but we were the good guys. Sure, the queen had us do the changling bit for a while, go out at night, snatch up a mortal child and put an identical Faerie in it's place until it had matured enough to come back into our society. We kept the mortal children comfortable in a place we called Dmerea, it was a blissful place where they were ignorant to the fact that they were not where they should be. No one was hurt, the mortal parents were only vaguely suspicious, and we always had envoys watching out for our children in the mortal world. 

The Unseelie Court however was far more cruel, they relished in the pain of mortals and lesser Fae creatures. They were those that raped, tortured, murdered, and bathed in the blood of the innocent. They committed acts more vile than any mortal could imagine. They were the Dark Court. 

Our world exists just beyond the veil of human sight, those mortals who enter may never leave. One taste of Faerie wine or fruit would have them in a madness that gave them illusions of pure happiness, and in our Court we made sure they had as much fun as we did. Oh the revelries, the midsummer festivities, the decadent treats and swaying music that could wisp a mortal away for hours, when it felt to them like only minutes. Time moves beautifully here, immortality is a dish best served with all the finest garnishes. 

I've lost track recalling the wonderousity of my home. It feels wrong to be only a wisp now, floating through the worlds unseen by mortals. I used to allow them to see glimpses of my beauty through my carefully constructed human glamour, oh how the mortals begged at my feet for a taste of me 

No longer though, I failed my quest and shall never again taste the wines and fruits, I shall never be lusted for again. I am shunned for the mistakes we made.

It began with the Seelie Queen requesting our audience to complete a task for her. We gave our word that we would do whatever we could, and our word is binding. We were to go into the mortal realm and retrieve a Sylph by the name of Nimrae. She was by far one of the most beautiful of the Fae, and she was also a Seer. Knights of the Dark Court had taken her in the hopes that her future sight and wisdom of the Seelie land could give them the advantage in the ever present war between the Courts. 

She was to be retrieved before they could torture too much information out of her, or kill her for her resistance. They sent in the three most cunning and strong of us to complete this task. I, Ashe, the bow wielder, one who could have an arrow flying into the throat of an enemy before they could beg for mercy. Rowan, the man of the sword, as quick with his blade as he was with his wit. Finally, Emrhia, a temptress whose magickal abilities were of the strongest wed ever known in the Light Court. Her powers of persuasion could convince a priest to break every commandment. The Queen was sure in her choices.

We set out an hour before dawn, through a vast expanse of tunnels hidden from the mortal world. It was a pure labyrinth to those not bred in Seelie world. On and up we went through the dirt staircase beneath a hollow tree. We rose from the veil between worlds sightless, and glamoured to mask our awe striking beauty. We appeared as three normal humans walking through a deep forest in the pale rays of dawn. By the time the sun had fully risen we were close to the mortal house in which the servants of the Dark Court had Nimrae captive. The house was covered in iron bars, it hurt to be near it. 

Immortality came with a ferocious weakness to iron, the touch of it seared off the skin of the Fae, and it struck me as odd that any of the Unseelie Court would be near a house with such toxicity surrounding it. The nearness of the metal had us slightly weakened, but if we avoided its touch we could get by. After all, we were the best suited for the mission. We were forced to enter the home directly through the front door, all other entries were barricaded in iron. I felt confident in our strength, though we could no longer maintain the glamours under the overpowering stench of the metal pressing around us, it didnt matter now that we were out of the mortal eye.

I felt sympathy for Nimrae, she must be in great pain as one of the Fae who was powerful in mind, but not great in strength. I doubted she could have run on her own. The house seemed surprisingly empty, but it was large and cavernous, she could be hidden anywhere within. We were deep in the house when we finally heard what sounded as though it was the stirring of a great beast. 

Suddenly from all sides creatures of the dark began to swarm, not Fae, but the products of evil. The products of Necromancy. Once mortals, these beings had been brought back by the darkest of magicks, the Unseelie Court had gone to extraordinary measures to keep this house guarded from other Fae. Their numbers were great, and they were unaffected by the iron confines of the building. These poor soulless beings, they had no sense of control over what they were doing. They were maggot ridden puppets, dirt strewn, muscle and tissue exposed, and armed with deadly blades of iron. Some appeared to be freshly dead, never buried at all. Those were the fiercest of them, with bloody dangling limbs, knife and bullet wounds, and gore covered bodies, they were still not deteriorated enough to fall as easily as the dead risen from the earth. We were outnumbered, but not overpowered. Rowan and I were excellent warriors of the Court, we cut down the hordes of undead monstrosities with great speed, though we received many small wounds from the nails and teeth of these beasts our abilities offered us quick healing. The wounds from the iron weapons were slowing us just enough that we couldnt entirely keep them at bay. Our flesh burned, and these wounds would not heal without treatment. The scratches and bites were already gone, fading pink scars on flawless skin, the cuts from the iron were already festering with infection. 

I looked over to see that Emrhia was being overrun by the creatures, her powers of light magick and persuasion did little to nothing against the disgusting monstrosities. Mindless and soulless beings, there was nothing for her to persuade, and the strength of the dark magick used to create them was not something she was equipped to combat. Try as we might, through the hordes of undead we were unable to reach her. Between the strikes of my arrows hitting putrid rotting flesh, I watched as they overtook her. She was viciously ripped apart, I could hear the sound of her skin searing away as they used their iron blades to lay into her. She didnt scream, she fought back with the ferocity that only the Fae hold. With all her might Emrhia tore them apart with her hands and teeth, but the sheer number of combatants was too much for her. They tore her limb from limb, cutting her apart with the toxic blades. I could smell the stench of burning flesh, it was almost sweet as the summer she was born in. 

The sickly sweetness gave away to the vile odor of infection and I caught one last glance of her resigned face as they overtook her, golden blood poured from her lips as she took a final gasp of air. She fell then, and they consumed her body and came at Rowan and I with renewed strength from the immortal flesh. We had decimated nearly two thirds of the undead army at this point, and being surrounded was not fairing well for us. With the speed that only the Fae possess we decided to make a daring dash for the nearest door with no enemies in our path. It was warded with iron chains, but with Rowan was quick to use  the hilt of his sword to break open the padlock holding them all together. Without second thought I pulled the chains from the door, the flesh of my palms smoked as I touched them, and the burning, searing, infection was instantaneous. I was in too much of a hurry to realize my grievous error at the moment, I was a warrior, pain was something I was trained to deal with. It hurt, but there were worse things than the feeling of the skin of my hands melting away. I watched my aquamarine skin turn black momentarily, and then the pus of orange infection began to bubble from beneath the burnt tissue. I hardly registered it. 

Rowan had grabbed me by the arm, cursing me for touching the toxic metal as we ran through the door, slammed it behind us and scurried down a darkened spiral staircase. Ill never forget what we saw, not only had our mission failed, but it seemed we had no chance of ever completing it. We found ourselves in a dark basement, more iron filled than any other part of the house. I could feel my lungs longing for pure air as the metallic scent invaded my senses, I felt my strength leaving me. The walls were entirely made of iron, it was as though we were in the hull of a ship. I could tell Rowan was having a hard time breathing in here as well, but we had a few moments of respite from our attackers, and he had managed to find a light switch. The illumination of the room only brought on sheer disgust and anger. 

Nimrae was dead. Her golden blood was dried to the floor, it would have looked appropriate in a mortal strip club. Her beautiful, waifish, lilac body was laid over large iron spikes, she was pierced through and through. Each metal protrusion was surrounded by blackened skin, and the pus of orange infection, now browning from age. Shed been dead for days, her translucent limbs had begun to disintegrate and turn to dust. She came to us from a far corner of the room, a wisp now. In her moment of near corporeality her soft voice whispered across the expanse, Do not die in here, the wisps may never leave this place. Then she was gone. 

I felt a moment of panic, if the wisps could not leave, then we could not confirm her death to the Seelie Queen. We would have failed, and faced the possibility of being banished to wander without a Court. The Courtless Fae were nearly as bad as the Unseelie. Centuries of purposeless wandering led to mischeviety, and that led to unwanted consequences for mortals. Many become slaves for the Dark Court. Rowan and I shared a look of despair, and then of resolution. We needed to leave this room, we couldnt die here, but perhaps we could win the favor back of the Queen somehow. I would have rather been a low level Seelie servant than be stuck as a wisp in this torture room. 

With determined resignation and the sound of the undead monstrosities thundering down the stairs, we began our ascension back up into the main room of our previous battle. The close quarters made my bow impossible to use, and I was limited to the use of two small enchanted daggers I kept for emergency use. The enchantment helped to cut through the decaying flesh of the creatures rapidly, and the small space made it easier for Rowan and I to cut through the masses in a linear fashion. We made it to the top of the staircase, covered in blistering burns, and deep pus filled gouges from the iron weapons used against us. The undead army was entirely decimated by the time we made it past Emrhias dismembered and disintegrating corpse, and with our waning strength we made a mad dash for the front exit. In the back of my mind I hoped that her wisp would not be trapped here, and that it was only the iron room that could forsake us to eternity locked away. I dropped my daggers, the skin of my hands was peeling apart rapidly, as the infection that I was trying to ignore ate deeper into my tissue and the pain was intense. 

We made it out of the house, but as we ran down the pathway towards the edge of the land the house sat upon, I felt my quiver and bow torn from my back where it rested. I turned with slowed reflexes, the effects of iron poisoning muddling my heightened senses. They had been waiting for us to leave the house. I watched almost in slow motion as a Knight of the Dark Court sent one of my enchanted iron tipped arrows flying into the air. An arrow that could kill any Fae creature if it struck true, and that it did. I turned to see Rowan several feet in front of me, in the midst of raising his sword to fend off our attackers, his other hand raised in shock to touch the arrow that had pierced his heart. I watched him fall, dark green skin covered in lines of the orange bubbling iron infection such as my own skin surely was. The look in his eyes before the life left him told me to run, but before I took two steps I felt a sickening sensation as my own bow was used to spear me. I felt in press sharply into my back before piercing through my skin and severing my spinal cord, the Knight used such force that I watched the bow tear out of my stomach before I fell to my knees, watching golden blood spill down my body onto the grass. I only remember a small pain in my neck before I became a wisp as my friends before me had.

Ill never see them again, the dead Fae are limited in their existence. I saw our bodies, golden blood mixed with orange pus, a bright array of violence on our delicately colored skin. I was sad to see that the Dark Knights had beheaded me with an iron blade, I saw that it seared their hands, but they relished in the pain as they used it to viciously tear Rowan and I apart. At least I died a gloriously colorful death. As a wisp I could only rarely show myself as semi-corporeal for moments at a time. The rest of my existence is spent as what mortals would think of as a ghost, though I can see other wisps on midsummers eve, and become nearly corporeal enough to actually be a part of the revelries. Midsummer is far off though, and I wont know until then if Emrhias wisp made it out of that cursed place, and Ill forever wish we knew how to set Nimrae free from the iron prison. 

We failed our one task, we failed it before we even began. We fought hard, and fiercely, but it was all for nothing... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds to me like the intrusive thoughts were actually being caused by the therapist. Giving his patients false advice that worsened their conditions, using suggestive wording to increase the frequency of the thoughts, possibly even using some type of hypnotherapy to give his patients symptoms and intrusive thoughts.

<TEXT> 
I was always a background character in my life. I never stood out in any way, which is perhaps why I was one of less than ten who survived. In a large city that would be an incredibly low rate of survival, even in a small town it was abysmal. Less than ten, out of hundreds. I have a thing for numbers, not obsessively though. I'm not overtly good at math or calculations, I never even got the chance to go to college before the "events" took place. What a mockery of brutal genocide, They call it an "event" as though it was some show you could purchase cheap tickets to and watch for pure amusement. It feels like that's what They did, but they won't admit it. They'll never admit it to anyone, because they need more "events" and more results. More research. More tests. We were subjects, and you could be one too. 


Everyone in the lab is asleep now, it took me weeks of close watching to figure out the series of numbers they use to password each computer in the building. Every computer is a different sequence of numbers, but I've developed a good memory of numbers. 427. That number is always stuck in my head. Anyways, I'm off track again, and I need to quicken my pace of typing before someone wakes up and realizes I've left my room. I chose the computer furthest from my room to lessen the chances of being found right away if they see my empty bed, and to throw suspicion off myself if they were to find out about this information leak. This was the first place I could think to go that might believe me... But okay, I really need to get going on this so they can't keep it a secret anymore.

I can't remember how long ago it started, I've been stuck here for what feels like years, but They tell me we've only been in observation for seven months, and that the "event" only happened over a course of three weeks. Those three weeks may have been an eternity, I don't believe that They would tell us the truth now. When it started though, no one realized that it was the beginning of the end. 

I wanted to become a journalist I recall, not the shady type who sought out celebrities to stalk, but the honest type who could bring truthful news to our town. Our town of 427 citizens. I wasn't a journalist though, I was a 19-year-old girl with an unknown father and a mother who could barely hold the title. She was a bar crawler even at the aged of 51, but these details aren't that important. All I did was work the cash part-time at the local gas station, and all my money went to paying bills on a rundown trailer that was barely livable. It was in the woods though, so at least no one had to see where I spent my nights. Just another thing that I attribute to my survival though, enough about me though, you need to hear what They did to us.

The day everything all started I was wandering around the town clinic. I was curious about what kind of story I might find by judging the minor injuries and ailments the townspeople came in for. I had never ventured to the clinic unless I was hurt, and on this visit it struck me as odd how advanced it was for being in such a meager populated area. It had more medical equipment than I'd expect based on out population, but it made a sort of sense given the fact that our town was literally surrounded by hundreds of miles of forest, with the nearest hospital being over an hour away by helicopter. People didn't come or go much simply because of our isolation, we really had all the necessities. 

I'm rambling on again, but you can understand the general idea of how the "event" was entirely missed by the rest of the world. in the town of 427 people there were 34 pregnant women, 156 children age eighteen or under, 93 people over the age of fifty ("elderly"), and 144 adults aged nineteen to forty-nine (not including the pregnant women). This is important to me. Population: 427.

In the clinic that day, every single one of the pregnant women came in. Some had regular check-ups, but some said they were feeling off and worried about their growing fetuses. I won't go into extreme detail here, but through my lurking the halls and such I learned that every mother in her first trimester had miscarried, 15 women in the same day. I could tell that the clinic staff was very concerned about this, but they didn't alert any of the women to the fact that it happened to all of them. The other 19 women who were further along had worse issues after examination. Each and every women had no signs of life in their wombs, and upon extensive testing by the doctors to see if they had miscarried, they found something even more disheartening. Those 19 women left the clinic with the news that instead of a baby, there were large tumors, and that they would need to come back to schedule an appointment for treatment and surgery at a real hospital, as the clinic didn't have the means to deal with this.That was day one, 34 fetuses lost, population remaining at 427. 



Through the next week, I stayed around the clinic to see if I could learn some of the results of various tests that the clinic did run on the mothers. I never saw the mothers from the group of 15 return, which I thought was strange, as I was sure there would be follow-up appointments to make sure their bodies healthily made it through the loss. Only 8 of the women who had grown tumors showed up to the clinic. My eavesdropping told me that all of the women should have returned for further examination, but by the end of the week they had all stopped coming in. Upon sending in friends of the women to see why they had stopped appearing for appointments, brutal scenes were found. 12 women in the group of 15 lived with family. It appeared that each had gone on a murderous rampage, every family member had been gutted in their beds. The women were all without eyes, they had torn them from their sockets with their bare hands, and each one seemed to have cut open their own wombs to check for a life that had disappeared. It was assumed that they bled to death from the self-inflicted injuries. 12 women, 12 fathers, 9 children, and 4 of the elderly were among those deaths. The 3 women who lived without family had all brutalized themselves in the same manner, though one had 4 other young children, whose eyes she had torn out after brutally stabbing each of them over a hundred times, and their teenaged babysitter. Population: 382.

The other 19 women were also found dead, though in a much different way. It seemed the tumors had grown so much in those few days that they tore through the stomach of each woman. Instead of looking as one would expect, the witnesses said that it appeared a large, jagged, sickly green type of crystal formation had pierced through the women from the inside, and that the homes smelled as if the bodies had rotted for weeks. Every family member who was in the home when the crystallizations violently thrusted themselves through layers of uterus and skin was found dead as well. 14 fathers had drowned, strangled, suffocated, stabbed, burned, hung or buried their own children alive, and anyone else in the home. 11 elderly, 7 adult children or visitors, and 29 more children dead, and each of those men had torn out their eyes and thrown themselves off the highest point in their homes afterwards. The other 5 mothers were found dead the same way, but each of them save one woman had another child living at home. Those 4 children tore out their mothers eyes as well as their own, and then threw their bodies on top of their deceased mothers so that they were sickeningly speared through in a final embrace. Population: 298.

The town was in shock, no one had any idea what could be going on. The 36 elderly, 17 adults, and 12 teenagers who helped identify and report the deaths of these families all became sick within hours, and these volunteers included half the medical staff in town. Almost the entire town had gone to the clinic to demand to know what was going on, everyone was trying to call out and get help from a larger hospital, from police, or even the CDC due to the strange nature of deaths, but all the lines were dead. Cell reception, internet, data, landlines, and any form of communication we had, was useless. No one had noticed when it happened, the town had spent the entire day trying to find these women, and then tallying up the gruesome deaths. People were enraged, but none more so than the 65 individuals who had gone near the "infected" homes, as the townsfolk were now calling it. I watched the gathering from a distance, I didn't know anyone in the crowd well enough to feel like joining in, and since my few days at the clinic I'd been wary of all people in general. I was afraid. The people exposed to the homes were very angry, it didn't take long for the violence to erupt. As the "exposed" began fighting, they also began changing. Blood began to leak from their eyes, and tiny green crystallizations were appearing to tear jagged holes as they erupted from the skin all over their bodies. 

Those who had not been exposed, quickly noticed the malformations appearing on the other townsfolk, and some ran to their cars and sped off, others ran for shelter indoors, and I suppose those that considered themselves brave were the ones who reached for weapons. I watched this all from a second story window above a store, relieved that I could wait til the obvious bloodbath was over before trying to leave town like some had. Few of those who stayed to attempt to fight the exposed had real weapons, there were some small knives, some wooden posts wrenched from nearby fences, and a handgun or two. I'm not a fighter myself, I couldn't tell you what they were, but I could tell you that it was pretty rare in our town for people to actually bother owning a gun. Suffice to say defenses were low, and the defenders only numbered about 50 people. They were torn apart. The exposed came together and ripped, clawed, scratched, bit, and used every sharp little crystallization they'd grown as a weapon against the people trying to ward them off. When the bloodbath was over the street looked like Mardi Gras, if streamers and confetti were blood, bone, and trails of internal organs. Those people were destroyed, and what was left of them began forming small crystallizations. 


I watched from my lookout spot as the infected people began to tear themselves apart in the street, there were a few of the defenders children standing by, I feel bad that they didn't have the guidance to run, and I was too a


**Edit: One of Them was wandering the halls and I could think of no other thing to do than submit what I had so far, everything seems clear and I'll continue my account of events now, just for clarity I will repeat that sentence I was writing** 


I watched from my lookout spot as the infected people began to tear themselves apart in the street, there were a few of the defenders children standing by, I feel bad that they didn't have the guidance to run, and I was too afraid to draw attention to myself to try and yell for them to run away. They faced the same fate as the others. I decided then I should seek out something to filter the air, in case it really was some type of infection that they were breathing. I had a thick cloth over my face for a few days before I found an incredibly old gas mask in an elderly man's abandoned house. I felt the need to tally up deaths again: 65 exposed, 47 who attempted to defend (22 adults, 7 teenagers, 18 elderly), and 13 children who were torn apart in the aftermath. Population: 173.

 

It was just a few days after the bloody fight the other children started getting sick. I think this was almost two weeks into the disaster we were facing, and it was hard to watch. It was the youngest first. People were bringing in their babies and toddlers who had blood pouring from their eyes, by the time they got in to see the few remaining doctors, they had already died and the disgusting crystallizations were growing directly through their eyes. The medical staff had no explanations, they didn't have the knowledge and advanced technology to determine the cause of death. 49 children died within two days, some of the older ones tried to rip out their eyes before dying. Not long after the epidemic of children, our remaining medical staff became infected like the rest, went on a rampage and tore apart anyone in the care of the clinic, they had much more gruesome ways considering the available equipment they had. 27 adults and 6 of the elderly were in the clinic that day. The gore of the scene had people losing hope in the one place they thought might be able to save them. Nothing like watching through the window as a nurse attempt to sew her crystallized eyes into another persons body before violently crushing her skull with a repeatedly slammed door. I could almost imagine the smell as I watched the green crystals grow from the bloody remains of people, and slice their way from beneath the skin of those who were barely people at all anymore. Population: 91.



People left in the town began to panic even more when they wanted to leave and recalled those who had tried to leave town had never come back, nor had they gotten to truly leave. A few of the braver adults in the town went to see if the families and individuals had made it out of town, only to discover that we were entirely fenced in with electric wire. According to those that witnessed  the fence, it appeared that everyone who tried to leave got out of their cars to walk up to the fence, only to be shot as soon as they were within 300 feet. Some tried to drive through the fence, but bullets go through windshields, imagine that. It seemed the fence was stronger than the cars that managed to drive into it. Every passenger with the people who tried to leave was executed as soon as they exited the vehicle, and those who remained hidden ended up as infected and dead anyways. I think my mother was in one of those cars. 22 children, 30 adults, and 5 elderly died at that fence. Population: 34. I was tired of counting, we were nearly done. I didn't want to be near people, and to hear how many more were slaughtered by their neighbors, themselves, or whoever was keeping us inside this fence. I suppose it was probably by halfway through week two that I ran off into the woods and hid in my trailer, wearing a gas mask that probably belonged to an old man who was turned to vile and infectious green crystal. 


It felt like I was in that trailer for months, I had no idea how long it had been since everything began. Even now it all seems like it happened too fast. Soon I began to run low on food, and the will to go on when death seemed so inevitable. I had no idea that I was walking out from one prison into another. As I hit the main street I noticed that the gore and crystals were gone. I wasn't sure what to think, but the town seemed completely devoid of people. I gave up at that point, I had nothing outside or inside this town, no one would believe me if I was able to leave, and what if I was the last person alive here? I went to take off my mask and hoped the infection would take me with everyone else, but  before I could lift it over my face I felt a sharp prick in my thigh. By the time I looked down to see the cause, the world was a blur and I was falling..


I woke up in this facility. I have no idea where I am or entirely what has happened. All they have really said is that I survived a tragic event, I'm in a special care facility to heal, and that I was one of 9 who survived and was very lucky. They don't seem very happy that I'm "lucky" though...

So you're all caught up, and here's where I am at right now: I've looked through some of the files on this computer, since it seems they thought the password was enough to keep some of the information on the "event" un-encrypted, or whatever it is that people who are actually good with technologically do to keep their things private. I'll tell you what I've gathered from the few unlocked files. It seems that the government owns this place, the files often have "Med_Sci/PopCtrl" in the labels. Most of the files are confusing and hard to read, and there is no copy, paste, screenshot, printscreen or any type of tool I can find on this computer that isn't somehow blocked  so that it does not function. I found what looks like the file on my town, it's not very specific. It appears to have some chemical formulas, but I can't understand them and my mind goes kind of white when I try to write them down. Some notes that basically say, "chemical:  *%###$*, t#### release date: $ /#@/16, Loc: E$% * Springs, 97.9% success rate, test ####". I don't know what to make of everything there, every time I look at it I feel like I'm forgetting something... It almost hurts to look at the stuff in the file for my town. but E#### sp%%%% is definitely its name.

I have to go now I think I hear them searching for me.

I'll try to update if I can get back on one of the computers again, but I have no idea what else I could find that might stop them from causing another "event". Hopefully they don't expect anyone at the facility to leak information, but even if they find it doesn't mean they can hide the truth.

<TEXT> Ahh on my old account things like this killed me, I wrote a little three part series and EVERY SINGLE PART had comments like, "Well why didn't you break a window" "Why didnt you call the police and tell them" "Where did the locks come from" "Why didn't you fight back and leave" etc, when half these things were explained in the story. And those comments got more upvotes than the story itself, so the entire believability was shit upon. Call the police and tell them my husbands doppelganger is trying to kill me? Break a window that was barred over every time he entered the house? Even stated in the story something along the lines of the house seeming to enter a different dimension when the doppelganger appeared, where there was no escape. 

But there was also no escape from nearly every comment critizing the lack of the MC's ability to escape, and why these things are happening. 

If the writer in the story says "I have no idea how this is happening" then I assume you are a dick for leaving comments asking how it happened. It's like asking for proof, there is not always supposed to be a solid answer in horror, and that should add to the terrifying effect. 

Admittedly my example story was not well written, but the comments were just out of hand in general.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Perfection </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-21 01:50:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Before my final tasks of today, I have to let someone, somewhere know. This needs to be heard in case it ever happens again. I can't be crazy, I know it, and I truly hope I'm about to end this all tonight. In case I don't, the people of /r/nosleep seem to be the ones who will keep this in mind. When I'm done here, I will have done all that I can.

Have you ever heard of the children's game called "Perfection"? If you haven't played it, heard of it, or gotten the ridiculously catchy jingle from the commercials stuck in your head once before (to the tune of "Pop Goes the Weasel"), let me explain it a bit. Perfection is a game in which you are given a red box-like contraption with a blue top that pops up, and is covered in differently shaped slots which you are to fit small corresponding yellow pieces into, all before the the timer runs out. When it does, well, "**POP!** Goes Perfection!". 


As a child I was obsessed with the game, I thought I had it mastered. I could get every single one of those little, yellow shapes into their slots before the timer ended, and then "**POP!**", my meticulous work was scattered as the blue top popped out and destroyed the wonderfully perfect puzzle I had finished. One thing about this game that irked me so, was the fact that I could never prove to anyone that I could actually do it.


Being so young at the time, no one thought I could fit together so many randomized pieces into their perfect locations under the time constraint, "Elizabeth, you'll get it one day, you don't need to pretend, I'll bet it's rigged so no one could do it at all!" My mother smiled at this, she thought it was childish pride just trying to be something more than I was. To my six year old dismay, each attempt to prove that I had done it was somehow thwarted. If I asked someone to watch me, it seemed the timer had sped up and I had less than half the pieces placed before the sudden "**POP!**". It infuriated me, I had tried countless methods, switching off the game after I had completed the task, only to find that by the time I had brought someone in to look the timer had reset to the start, and they merely assumed I had filled all the slots without turning the game on.


"Now honey," my father had once scolded, "There's no pride in cheating, it really doesn't matter if you beat the game. But enough of the silly lying, there's no reason for it.". I **KNEW** that I had beat the game, that I had achieved the goal of Perfection, but I had no way to prove it to anyone but myself. I must have tried hundreds of times to show people, but no one ever believed my young self could do it, especially because no one else in my family ever had. My brother, older by two years, had only ever gotten about 75% into slots on his best days. My parents, aunts, uncles, any adult in my life I knew, simply couldn't finish in time either. They were always several pieces short, and became frustrated with my need to prove that it could be done, and that I was the one who could do it. 


In my daily routine I'd hum the little jingle while I did the meager amount of chores a child of that age has, I was always pleased with my work after it was done, because it was another thing I knew I was doing right. It seemed no one else saw it, the clothes I put away nicely folded in my drawers were always scattered about my room, the toys I had put away in the boxes before bed were set up as if I had spent the night playing instead of sleeping. Everyday I was reprimanded for my pride of doing my tasks so well, when no one ever saw that they were done at all. "Elizabeth, your lying is getting out of hand. There is absolutely no need to pretend you've done your chores just so you can obsess over that ridiculous game! I'm going to take it away if things don't start shaping up with you.", My father was almost at his limit with Perfection.


I was insistent though upon the fact that I was doing everything *perfectly*, and my wording on that was enough for me to be taken to a child psychologist who worked in town. I don't remember much of him, he was an odd tall man, with a smile that was awkwardly large and forced. The most I recall of the hushed conversation was some mention of a possible form of OCD, and some talk of how I may be intentionally leaving things amiss because of the lack of belief everyone had when I thought I was doing things correctly. I'm not really sure if he helped my parents at all, I just know when I spoke to him I had a sick feeling in my stomach, like he was looking for something dark and wrong inside me, and stirring it around.


After so much of my insistence that I had done it, that it really was PERFECT and complete, and exactly as it should be, my parents decided that perhaps I should just stop playing the game and focus on other things. They kind of forced it in fact, I remember seeking out the game one day while I was upset about chores I had done, but apparently *hadn't* done.


Over the years I lost interest in the game itself, but the jingle from the commercials always popped into my head at random moments, "*Put the pieces into the slot, make the right selection! But be quick you're racing the clock, POP! Goes Perfection!*" It started out as just occasional, something I found myself humming while performing random tasks that I was pleased at doing, and the more pleased I was at finishing the task, the worse everyone else saw the results of. 


Around the age of 13, I discovered the game put up in my old closet, and decided to take it down and test out my old skills to see if I still had what it took. Each and every time, I completed it with several seconds to spare, and began singing the little jingle to myself as I restarted my scattered masterpiece over and over again. It felt good to be doing something right that no one could tell me I was doing wrong. Eventually my mother walked in to see me back at my childish obsession. I hadn't realized she was there, I had just started placing pieces, and singing the jingle when it suddenly popped and scattered less than 10 seconds after the timer had started. I looked up to see her standing in the doorway, she chuckled quietly and sighed, "About to start high school, and you're still fixated on that little game that you just can't seem to beat." I frowned in dismay, *why can I not seem to achieve Perfection when others are around?* 


Throughout that summer I played the game in private, pleased with myself at the speed and ease of which I accomplished the game. Right before I was about to begin my Freshman year, I decided to put the old game back up in the closet. I was already one of the youngest to be in my class, I didn't need anyone outside of my family thinking I was obsessed with childish games. 


My troubles continued in high school itself though. I had been an excellent student in elementary and junior high, my grades always excelled and I was a quick learner, but something more than the just the natural teenaged hormones I was starting to gain. More and more often I found myself humming the jingle, especially when it was test time. It seemed to calm me. That year approximately half my tests were missing answers that I could swear I had written, I even told the teachers out loud what I had responded on the test with, and they simply thought I was being lazy and skipping questions I didn't know, and then studying them later to make it by for exam time. I had no idea what was going on, and my teachers were becoming disappointed in my grade drop. I was doing fine on everything except the tests. 


As I progressed through high school I found the jingle stuck in my head so often that it gave me migraines, over and over throughout the days it happily sang through my mind, "*Put the pieces into the slot, make the right selection! But be quick you're racing the clock! POP! Goes Perfection!*". My schoolwork overall went downhill as the song played through my mind each day, I was focused and I was getting all the correct answers for my notes, but I was turning in empty assignments I was sure I had completed, emailing in homework files that were so corrupted my teachers assumed I was intentionally trying to ruin their computers so that I could lie about finishing them, flawlessly acing tests that when I handed in were written in unintelligible gibberish.


I barely graduated, If not for my talk with a school psychologist I might not have. She never told me what she thought was wrong with me, but she seemed concerned once again that I considered all my work to be perfect. She kept a file about our meetings that I was never able to see, and she recommended my teachers give me only oral examinations. This helped greatly, I started hearing the jingle less in my head, though when I did, it now caused me a horrible stutter, which impacted my grading slightly, but I managed to scrape by. 


Somehow after that entire ordeal the psychologist from my childhood and the one from my school got together to discuss me with my parents. Being only 17 and a minor at the time, my parents had the entire say in what was going on in that department. I assumed I must be going crazy. At their recommendation, and to my family's relief, I was given a prescription to take that made the jingle disappear entirely from my head. My parents had told me that due to my "condition" the doctors requested I not be told what the medication was, only that it would help me lead a normal life. Which it honestly did for a very long time. 


I was able to function, I was actually completing the tasks that I believed I was doing, I couldn't even recall how the jingle went, or the name of the ridiculous game that drove me insane. After a few years of the medication the doctors decided I no longer needed it, and my memories should be entirely repressed by whatever it was they gave me. I was fine with not knowing, they had cured me, which was all that mattered to me at that time. If memories were to ever reoccur, I was to contact my family and we would revisit the doctors to see what needed to be done. 


I was ecstatic, my entire childhood of being haunted by a hellish game was over. I was done hearing a maddening tune in my head, I was done obsessing over the things I did wonderfully and yet somehow failed at. I was even more overjoyed at the fact that I could leave that small town and the condescending looks from the people that lived there. Half the town thought I was insane, and the more religious or superstitious folks thought I was cursed. So I moved out of state to pursue my normal life. I finally got to do what I wanted, I went to school for a financial degree, finished up and worked a modest job as a bank teller, met a lovely man named James who married me soon out of college, and a year later we had our beautiful baby girl. For a girl in her mid-twenties it was a happy life, an absolutely *perfect* life, until recently. 


My parents died in a car accident a few months ago, and apparently had left to me our old family home so that I may raise my own family there. I was saddened by the loss, but felt a sense of relief to be back in my familiar home. It was almost as if nothing had changed there, my old room looked as it had since I was a child. A pretty pale pink, a white single bed, and a closet full of old toys my mother had kept for sentimental value. My four year old Anna would adore the room for herself, I smiled as I imagined her playing with the old Barbie's and dollhouses I had left behind. 


While unpacking in the master bedroom I heard a familiar humming, something to the tune of "Pop Goes the Weasel". I felt an inner panic though I couldn't quite tell why. I went to check on my Anna, and found her sitting on her bed with a familiar looking game. Suddenly the little yellow pieces popped out their slots and I was hit with a flood of memories. I ran towards Anna and yanked the game away from her, she began to cry immediately, "Mommy! I almost did it, why are you taking it! I want to finish the game!" I felt sympathetic, I just didn't know if the game would ruin her childhood as it had mine. I sat on her bed and put my arm around her, "Honey, this game is very old, it could break very easily, so we have to keep it put away because it was a gift from Grandma, okay?." It wasn't an entire lie, but enough that she may lose interest in the game. She nodded her tear streaked face in agreement, but still pouted when I put the game on the highest shelf in the house.


I tried to get into contact with the doctors that had previously given the prescriptions to block my memories, but as the jingle played through my head, I kept dialing wrong numbers. "*Put the pieces into the slot, make the right selection! But be quick you're racing the clock! POP! Goes Perfection!*". The song was giving me a headache, I finally really did have the perfect life and a childhood game was going to ruin it all! 


I asked James if would call the numbers I had searched up, and he looked at me as though I had grown an extra head, "Sweetheart, these are numbers for decommissioned asylums, why would you want to call them?". I then explained to him the repressed memories that were now resurfacing, and the gist of the experiences in my childhood created by this silly little game. He seemed a bit skeptical, and concerned at the fact I had not divulged this information earlier in the relationship. I had touched upon the subject of going through and conquering mental illness during my childhood, but this story seemed beyond his comprehension. He didn't believe me. He thought there must be something else to it, and tried himself to search for the doctors which names I could only vaguely recall. None in this area with names even close to the ones I had thought of. It was a small town, and I knew that at least the woman who worked at my high school had to be on file somewhere, but his search turned up that the small school had never had more than a simple guidance counselor, and each one on file had been male. I felt the same stress and anxiety as I had many years ago, I was wrong when I knew I couldn't be. I knew there had been someone who had stopped this before.


In the midst of James trying to calm my nerves, I once again heard Anna humming the familiar tune. It sent me into a sort of rage, and I ran upstairs to see if she had somehow taken the game from her closet shelf. She was fast asleep, I shook my head in disbelief and dismay, *why is this happening, how can I stop this before it gets to her too?* I checked the time, it was nearly 11pm. Of course I must be hearing the jingle in my head again. I gave a resigned sigh, and went downstairs to ask James to just come to bed with me. I was sick of this day, and maybe some sleep would calm me and put things out of my mind. 


Around 1am I awoke with a start. "*Put the pieces into the slot, make the right selection! But be quick you're racing the clock! POP! Goes Perfection!*" I slipped from the bed quietly, as to not awaken James. I knew that game was going to taint my daughter as it had tainted me. I knew something had to be done. It had to go. I quietly stepped downstairs as I heard the jingle start over, this time in my daughter's voice. I was livid. I went to the front closet where we kept a bat for safety, in case of intruders or the like. I made my hastily back up the stairs to destroy the growing evil. I stepped quietly into Anna's room, and saw that she was mouthing the words to the jingle in her sleep. I sighed, fearing she was already in the clutches of this curse. I took the game from the shelf and began the timer.


I raised the bat over my head and swung with all my might. It took at least three solid hits before bloody, bloody, pulpy gore began to coat the bat, each swing felt so heavy, but my mind began to feel so light. I heard the telltale **POP** of the game scattering it's pieces, at the same time as I heard a gasp from behind me.


James stood in the doorway, pale as a ghost. He began to speak, "Elizabeth.. What have you... *Put the pieces into the slot, make the right selection! But be quick you're racing the clock! POP--*" The jingle coming from his mouth was silenced as I brought the bloody bat across his jaw. The evil of Perfection had gotten him to. He cowered on the ground, holding his shattered jaw and staring at me with utter disbelief. How DARE he not believe me now, he was cursed. I brought the bat down over, and over again. His entire face was destroyed. I felt so calm having saved him from the horrible evil I lived so long with. 


I turned back to look around Anna's room, only one thing left to do to bring peace to my family. I picked up the game off the floor, and calmly walked down to the living room. I lit a fire in the large stone fireplace, and set the timer on the game once more. I smiled as I fit each piece into it's slot, but suddenly the timer ran out. With only two pieces left to place, I had not achieved my goal. I was distraught, but it was still time to do my final task. 


I've thrown the cursed game into the fire, the flames are large and black smoke is curling towards me as I type this. I've warned you all, Perfection is truly a curse. The fire is calling me now, it's singing the jingle with me, "*Put the pieces into the slot, make the right selection! But be quick you're racing the clock! POP! Goes Perfection!*"

<TEXT> Imagine one of your parents dying, within six months they're replaced by a seemingly perfect parent that you can't help but feel something is off about, though to the outside world everyone thinks they're amazing. Now this new parent comes in and changes your entire lifestyle, your technology use is limited, if you are before college age you are now condemned to your home and taught only by the replacement parent. Everyone in your home that is unrelated to you that helped in your daily lives is suddenly shut out, and the children in your home are now forced to take responsibility for caring for an immaculate and large property, which would occupy an insane amount of the time they could use to learn information about the new parent. The one thing you're amazing at, excel at, and enjoy is sold away. Only because of your status as someone about to leave the home and move far off for school, you have the priveledge of technology use, a priveledge that the new parent should have no real say in, because you are past the age where they can truly parent you, and were not the original giver of said priveledges. Now imagine finding out that new parent had a previous past of getting into relationships with families who lost a parent somehow (divorce/death/etc) and each spouse from the previous relationships has died. Odd right? Kinda makes you worry about your family, this perfect wonderful widow, who never mentioned the fact that he/she was a widow several times over, weird thing to leave out if it was just a stroke of bad luck. And then finally figuring it all out, when you knew something was off the entire time. Imagine finding the proof, and being the cause of your biological parents death because you showed them said proof. Imagine hiding and fearing for your life with two small and terrified children, who have no idea what's going on. Just imagine the perfect replacement being absolutely everything that could have been wrong. And imagine what would happen if you fell for the act like every other family, including the rest of yours did. 

Got a single parent? I know a lovely lady named Charlotte who is just wonderful with families c;

<TEXT> Brings a whole new meaning to the term Trophy Wife. 
Shit ain't right when in less than six months you've got all outside help in the house gone, limited access to technology and the outside world, and are expecting kids to call you "Mom" less than a year after they lost their mother. 
Question though, did she kill the other children from her past homes? 
It's like a reverse Client List.

<TEXT> As an extremely picky eater when it comes to certain things, this story made me nauseous in the way that /u/iia stories make me sick, but pleased at the same time. Only knew of one type of smut before today, and am not disappointed in my discovery of this kind. Regardless of other commenters describing the taste, I could not put grey, oozing, puss-looking nuggets in my mouth, or even on my plate. 
Good job OP, I now cannot get rid of this mental image c:  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely overlooked his theft of the switch while commenting, it makes the painting make more sense. He definitely wouldn't be an average changling, along with what other cruelties they would have inflicted, it makes sense about the painting being his prison of sorts. He may be forced forever to watch the world move on without him, and was likely forced to watch as the changling child tormented his family. Thank you for noticing my error!

<TEXT> My knowledge is mostly from more modern faerie texts, books on the subject, research I've looked into as the species fascinates me, the Irish lore of it all is absolutely amazing as well. Though I'm not Irish myself, it is where most say their true origin on earth began, that is before mortals lost sight of them, but they're still here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ahh, after reading about it, I've gathered that you were likely poisoned by whomever yelled at the children, the question remains then, why did the doctors say you were always there? Or you were poisoned as a child and therefore technically HAVE always been there... That would be a nightmare experience, though it appears you are one of the very rare and lucky few to have recovered, time for some sweet sweet revenge c;  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Fey/Fae are notoriously cruel beings, and it's under incredibly rare circumstances that a changling child would be switched back, especially considering the Fey child is dead. Though most human children taken are unaware of their misfortune if being switched, and are commonly happy and blissfully forgetful of their lives in the human world. The painting part is odd, I've never heard of a mortal child being able to communicate in any way to the human world once they've been taken. 

Edit to add:
It's unfortunate you/she couldn't learn the true name of the Fey child, I've heard tale that with it you have a form of control, and could have commanded the child be returned, though it may not exactly work the way you wish.

<TEXT> What if the "air" inside of the man's suit was in fact some malevolent spirit or entity that was trying to use the man as a host, by taking away all possibility of life or control without the entity being held in by the suit? 

Perhaps the head and spinal cord were required to keep the entity tethered, and the entity kept the man alive enough that he only had brain function, enough to know something was amiss, but unable to communicate what may have happened. 

The case may be that the doctor not only killed the only living part left of the host, but released a dangerous being that could be looking for it's next victim. 

You should keep an eye out for past and future cases, a large risk could be unleashed on the world.

<TEXT> Oh God I really felt bad on this one. Crossing the border from Ontario to Michigan my family was brought into a building so they could search our car and question us about our trip. The male border officer was having a bad day, his back hurt, and he also ended up staying late after his shift because of the amount of time he spent questioning us. He started out with asking my parents, then moved on to us "kids" (I was 18 at the time, brothers 10, 5, and newborn). He started questioning me about vague things that any family member could have answered, and because my brother was sitting behind me and I couldn't quite tell who the officer was looking at, I kept hesitating before I finally just said, "I'm sorry, but I can't tell if you're asking me or my brother, I can't tell who you're looking at." And man, did I regret that. He then very aggitatedly told me that he had a lazy eye, and made me feel like a moron. Then he made sure I knew he was addressing me by asking about high school, any drug use, and if I was part of a prostitution ring, and other such things which made my extremely anxiety ridden self want to cry. We ended up being allowed to cross after the extremely uncomfortable questioning, after which my entire family questioned how I was the only one who didn't notice the eye. 
God, I wish I hadn't asked who he was talking to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard before that it's 28 days to be exact, I quit smoking for about three weeks cold turkey, went to visit family and fell right back into the habit. Though for starting a good habit I feel like it's more applicable, especially addictive personality wise. Hard to quit anything when addiction runs in your genes though.  </TEXT>
