<TEXT> Good question! When I [did this last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/4c3fl3/jwalking_a_fantasy_baseball_experiment/), nobody knew ahead of time because it was a spur-of-the-moment decision when I realized my first three picks all had J-names. 

This year, the league commissioner did email me ahead of time to ask if I was doing a gimmick again, for his own curiosity and so he could "get out of my way" and avoid M-names if he was torn between two players. I don't know if the rest of the league remembers me from last year, but prior to the draft I changed my team name to something innocent like, "David's Great Team" to hopefully throw them off the scent.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It varies depending on the state. But it's pretty normal for the primaries. 

For the general election, you're absolutely right that anyone even asking which party you plan to vote for is a big no-no. But for the primaries it's whatever. 

**EDIT**: the thing about Virginia is that you don't register for a party. You get to choose which primary you vote in on primary day (but not both!). So even if I'm a Democrat, I could choose to use my vote in the GOP primary to vote against someone if I wanted. Hence them needed to ask which Primary you want a ballot for. 

It's actually pretty nice since it gives the voter *more* options rather than fewer.  </TEXT>

I voted in the 2012 Primaries in Virginia and the 2016 Primaries in Texas, and in both places the first question they ask at the location is which primary you're voting in, and then they give you that specific ballot.

<TEXT> You say you practice every day. What is your practice like?

Someone mentioned it yesterday, but after warming up I like to play a "virtual round" on the range. I'll tee off with my driver. If I hit it well, I then aim at the close flag for my "second shot". If my drive was bad, I aim at one of the farther flags. If my "second shot" isn't on the mark, then I take a third shot and chip at a target ~20 yards in front of me. Then I keep track of how many "GIRs" I get that way. You can also mix it up by throwing in some virtual Par-5s and doing driver, hybrid, approach.

It's a fun way to simulate a real round and switching up clubs and taking different shots. It adds a little bit of the real pressure of, "Okay, I need to make this shot." I started doing that about a month ago and I've seen a huge improvement over just going to the range and hitting 10 balls with each club.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is something a lot of people don't understand: one small injury somewhere can create a cascading problem elsewhere as you compensate.

It's extremely common in runners. You start feeling some pain in your left knee, so you begin to favor your right leg to compensate for it. Then your right leg becomes injured as a result. 

The pitching motion uses your whole body: legs, core, arm. Any injury to one part can cascade injuries to the rest.  </TEXT>

I mean, this is what really scares me about Bitfinix. They start having withdrawal issues, and then they begin skyrocketing and dragging all the other exchanges with them. 

I know it's not exactly like Gox, and it's probably fine, but it's similar enough to give me the heebee-jeebies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, that's what /u/muddlesthrough was originally saying: beginners *are* duffing and blading chips. It's nuts out there. I play as a single a lot, and get matched up with lots of guys who can hit off the tee fine, and their mid-range shots are serviceable, but then around the green they fall apart. 

Among beginners, it's rare to see guys with good chipping feel. The number of shots bladed across the green is staggering every time I play. Not to mention that when they do get up on the green, their chip shot was so bad it left them with a 60+ foot putt and a likely 3-putt.  </TEXT>

And he did follow procedure: the head of the House Ethics Committee sent a formal letter to Comey inquiring on the status of a case, and Comey followed procedure by responding. 

It sucks that this was then used as ammo by the GOP against Clinton, but the blame is squarely on Chaffetz, not Comey.  </TEXT>

**EDIT**: just to elaborate on this, I think most average/good golfers take for granted how difficult chipping around the green is. It's incredibly hard. A few months ago bad chipping was easily responsible for 7-10 strokes on every round I played, and is still that way for the buddies I play with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  there's not much difference from great scrambling and serviceable scrambling on the courses most amateurs play.

Uhhh

I just started playing last August, and there's an enormous difference. Beginners are always *around* the green without being on it. Chipping is ridiculously important for a beginner, arguably moreso than for someone more skilled.

Chipping is also awfully hard (for a beginner). 10 yards from the green with a bunker in the way? Better to take two shots to go *around* the bunker than try going over it. Ball on the slop of a raised green? Yeah, either I'm going to hit it short and have it roll all the way down, or I'm going to hit it 10 yards over the green and have to do it all over against from the other side.

Maybe I have a unique perspective because I just started playing a few months ago, but chipping is one of the most important things for a beginner to practice, and it's the single biggest thing that improved my game from shooting 110 to the low 90s.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> +1 for this. I like to keep score, focusing on how many shots over GIR I am on each "hole". So I'll pretend the first hole is a Par 4 and use my driver. If I nail it straight and long then I'll use a 9 or 8 iron on my second shot and aim for the shorter flag on the range. If my drive was off then I'll use my 5-6-7 irons and aim for a longer flag. If I miss, then I chip next, aiming for somewhere in front of me on the range.

If this is your experience then you probably have a gambling-like problem. I say that without any malice, but if you're taking profits on a small amount and that's making it difficult to sleep then maybe you should seek counseling?

Again, I say this without malice or internet-douchbaggery. But nobody should lose sleep over something like that, especially over taking profits.  </TEXT>

The GPS on my course's carts shows an overhead map of the course, with a touch-screen allowing me to see distance to certain objects. So if it's a 420 par 3, I can tap the screen in the middle of the fairway and it will split it into, "250, 170" yardages. Really helps strategically play.  </TEXT>

 A batter is out for illegal action when: He interferes with the catchers fielding or throwing by stepping out of the batters box or making any other movement that hinders the catchers play at home base.

<TEXT> This is such a misrepresentation of what happened. Sanders was asked if he endorsed Ossoff, and he said he didn't know him very well. So the reporter said, "Do you think Ossoff is a real progressive?" (a ridiculously loaded question), [so Bernie then said](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/329559-sanders-i-dont-know-if-ossoff-is-progressive):

 I dont know. If you run as a Democrat, youre a Democrat. Some Democrats are progressive, and some Democrats are not."

The journalist was trying to bait Sanders into a controversial comment, and when Bernie gave him a vague nonspecific answer to avoid it everyone took it out of context anyways. He's not the one creating some sort of "purity test".

Guys like TheJester, John Schindler, and MikeFarb (who all have various IC sources) have suddenly started chatting about a big news story breaking today. Usually they have info about 24 hours in advance because newspapers call people in advance for their statement (which is why Trump always knows when to cause a tweet storm when a big story is breaking).

<TEXT> Screw over people? I think you've got it backwards. 

The baseline scenario is no obstruction. Ideally, there are no obstructions on a golf course, but of course you have to have a rake *somewhere.* Putting the rake toward the fairway is intentionally creating a barrier to negate a percentage of the bunker. "Always replace it where it would help someone (aka keep them out)" is a ridiculous thing to do. You're intentionally altering the conditions of the course.

[Golf Digest](http://www.golfdigest.com/story/does-anyone-know-where-bunker-rakes-should-go) says the following:

 Though theres not a specific rule about where to put rakes, there is a decision that deals with the issue. It explains that **the biggest concern is the rake getting in the way of play**. So, dont leave them inside the bunker along a steep bank, because it could catch someones ball. Dont toss rakes into the middle of bunkers, because youre just a jerk if you do that. **And dont lay them in front of bunkers, because it could stop someones ball from going into the bunker.**

I don't want a piece of equipment affecting my play, even if it helps me. If I go in the bunker, then I go in the bunker and need to fight my way out. That's golf. You're not giving "common courtesy" by intentionally creating an obstruction that changes the course conditions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've done that by accident on a Par 5 once. Second shot, was something like 270 out, so I used my hybrid (which I normally hit around 200-220) just to get it close. I hit it smooth and perfectly straight, it takes a cartoonish bounce off a sprinkler head, and rolls all the way through the green and out the back. The guys on the green put their hands in the air like, "WTF?" 

I immediately drove up to the green to apologize to the guys, and thankfully they had a sense of humor about it when they heard what happened. They said it probably would have been an albatross if the flag was in. 

I ended up blading the chip, then three-putting for a 7.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I played Stadium Links at the Rangers stadium last November. [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/5e431t/stadium_golf_at_the_ballpark_in_arlington_fun_way/) a post I made about it back then. It was a lot of fun, though kind of a gimmick.

Your normal entry fee gets you one ball per hole, but you can pay extra and get two balls. There's no putting; your score is determined by how close to the hole you hit it. On the green is par, within the circle around the hole is a birdie, off the green is a bogey. That sort of thing. The holes were between 110-180 yards, though the distances posted were *way* off compared to what our laser-scope said. So bring one if you have it.

Beyond that, they had chipping and putting skills areas setup for you to play before or after your round, but they cost extra money, and the prizes weren't great. 

Overall it was a fun experience with my brothers and dad, but I wouldn't do it again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few weeks ago I got paired up with the most talkative guy in the world. He was friendly, but he thought everything he said was the *funniest thing anyone had ever said*, and would stare at you to make sure you thought so too. He just talked, and talked, and talked, even while the rest of us were on the tee box over our ball.

Worse, we were grouped up with two women, and he kept making inappropriate comments. "I wish I could put a wig on and hit from those tees!" and "It's alright honey, it's a tough sport for the men too" and stuff like that. And after each such comment he'd laugh and say, "I get in trouble for saying stuff like that, glad you two aren't uptight!" But the women were obviously annoyed, and ended up quitting at the turn. 

Normally I would have broken away from the guy and let him play on, but there was a foursome ahead and behind us so I didn't have many options. And I'm the kind of guy who lets stuff like this bother me, so of course I had a shitty time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was at the driving range yesterday and a man comes rolling up holding onto one of those senior walkers. He's got just one club with him, a driver with an enormous head. Guy can barely walk.

He parks his walker, stumbles a few feet to the hitting mats, and tees up his ball. No practice swings or anything, just grips it and rips it. Form is obviously awful, all arms and hardly any follow through, but he's hitting them flush. One by one he drives them right down the middle, about 200 yards with some roll. Hits maybe two dozen, waddles back to his walker, and inches his way off the range. 

I wish I had gone over and high-fived him.  </TEXT>

There's value in opening up a roster spot, though. So it's really a balance of **A) Days Lost To DL** vs **B) Days Gains From Roster Spot**.

<TEXT>   Barron v. Baltimore in 1833 held that the protections of the bill of rights did not apply to state governments.

Ehhh, Barron v Baltimore has been implicitly overruled:

 However, beginning in the early 20th century, the Supreme Court has used the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (interpreted, however, to have the same meaning as the 5th amendment) to apply most of the Bill of Rights to the states through the process and doctrine of selective incorporation. Therefore, as to most, but not all, provisions of the Bill of Rights, Barron and its progeny have been circumvented, if not actually overruled.

It hasn't been explicitly overruled, but it's not a valid precedent anymore and no modern judge would cite it in a ruling.  </TEXT>

It seems to get worse every single year. Choppy, crappy resolution, buffering takes forever. I've tried in Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Edge. Same issues. It's unbelievably frustrating. 

**EDIT**: the especially frustrating thing is I can watch it on my mlb.tv app on my iPhone and it streams flawlessly in HD. What the fuck is wrong with mlb.tv's browser support? </TEXT>

Fifteen years ago I totally agreed. It's a good concept on paper. Any time a dictator can be removed and democracy allowed to take over, that has to be good, right?

Turns out the alternative to dictators (ISIS) is often times much, much worse. The last decade has shaken a lot of my fundamental thoughts about democracy and world politics.  </TEXT>

I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying the Marlins are worth less than what Forbes estimates?

Because the numbers being thrown around in the news suggest that Loria is selling the team for [**three times** what Forbes said they're worth](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2017/02/09/miami-marlins-claim-to-have-1-6-billion-handshake-agreement-for-team)

It's a pretty established trend now. When a team gets a new stadium, their valuation skyrockets.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, keep in mind journalists want to get to the *truth*. And part of finding that truth means talking to the accused.

Not to mention, misunderstandings happen. There are scenarios where a newspaper publishes a story and it turns out they're wrong or misinformed, and if they had reached out to the other side they might have discovered as much beforehand. So reaching out to the opposite side to get their comment can cover their ass, too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The people I play with and I have a "gimme range" to speed up the game. Usually 2-3 feet. The unofficial rule is that everyone has to agree to it. "Yeah we'll give it to you," that sort of thing. It's a simple and easy policy.

But we have this one friend who always takes advantage of it. He'll stretch the boundary to 4-6 feet, and take it without asking any of us. And he pulls this shit all the time: the half-ass tap-in while putting his other hand down to "guide" the ball into the hole. And he does the exact same scan-the-green move afterwards to see who noticed. It's the same goddamn look Trump does in that video.

Fuck people like that. I see you.  </TEXT>

$49 a month, and you get free range balls and cheap tee times ($16 after 2:00). The course is always in great shape, with pristine greens and GPS carts. And the cart girls are always out and about. 

The only downside is that a few highschools practice there, so from 2:30-5:00 on weekdays the range is a bit crowded.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I spent a few days researching letter options. The ones I investigated initially were K, D, C, and M. The first two just weren't doable, but C and M were. So I made a big spreadsheet of the depth for those two letters: 

http://i.imgur.com/NHsT9xc.png

C is doable, but there are some big problems. Firstly, there are huge holes at Catcher, 2B, and 3B. Running Chase Utley and Chase Headley out there every day just isn't going to have much success. 

Secondly, the C players aren't spaced out enough. There are 14 C-players in the top 100 picks, especially the pitchers bunched up from average pick 57-80. I did several mock drafts and in each of them I just wasn't able to get a large enough percentage of C-players to field what I would consider a competitive team. M was better all-around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, you make a lot of sense. Margot's knee injury (he hasn't played since March 5) also led me to wait on him too. 

But you're absolutely right that I'm lacking in speed. Right now my lineup had a combined 24 SB in 2016, and 10 of those are from Semien. There's just not a lot of speed when it comes to M-names, beyond Trout and Betts. So Margot is someone I'll be checking in on every morning for the first month or so.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was reaaaaaaaaaaally torn between Margot and Conforto. In the end, their spring training is what broke the tie (Margot has been terrible, while Conforto is doing great). But you bet your ass I'm watching Margot closely. 

I'm awfully high on Montgomery's chances this year. Leake is sort of a known quantity with a ceiling of being average, so I know he'll sit on the waiver wire and never get picked up by anyone else. So my plan is to give Montgomery the chance to break out, and if he loses his spot in the rotation then I'll switch to Leake.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sup guuuurl.

I know I haven't been around in a while. Been eight months since we saw each other, right? I just, well, I've been busy. Doing my thang. Giving you your space. You know how it is. But baby, wait! Hold on, don't leave, hear me out. I need to get something off my chest.

*I've changed*. 

I'm a different fantasy baseball manager now. I dropped my old habit cold turkey, cleaned up my act: no more messing around with guys like Jose and Jeanmar. I've deleted Justin Verlander's name out of my phone. Josh Donaldson keeps standing on my lawn with a boombox over his head playing "In Your Eyes" but he means NOTHING to me, because baby, I've got a *new* gimmick. And guuuuurl, this time I'm not going to disappoint you. This time we'll make it through, I promise. Just give me a chance, will ya?

Behold, my new fantasy baseball experiment: 

#M as in Mancy

([the name reference, for those of you who don't watch Archer](https://youtu.be/_K_WmV50e7c))

* [Hitting](http://i.imgur.com/IgRQVqZ.png)
* [Pitching](http://i.imgur.com/8YLsAEI.png)

If you don't remember me from last year, I'm the guy who drafted J. Donaldson, J. Abreu, and J. Martinez in the first three rounds and realized that all their names began with J, so I [created an entire fantasy team around the gimmick](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/4c3fl3/jwalking_a_fantasy_baseball_experiment/). We were in 1st place for most of the year, finished 2nd in the regular season and had a bye week in the playoffs, before narrowly losing in the second round. 

I'll be posting weekly updates (or bi-weekly, or tri-weekly, or whenever I goddamn feel like it get off my back *mom*) on Mondays this year to keep you abreast of the glory (and failures) of **M as in Mancy**. Also, I'll probably be making my posts on my blog to keep everything in one place instead of cross-posting all over the interwebz. So next week it will be a direct link to my blog/website www.DavidKristoph.com, unless mods have a problem with that. I'm cool with whatever. 

Anyways. Read on if you want to hear about my draft strategy and how I ended up with the team I did. Otherwise, cheers to another hopefully-successful-but-probably-disastrous fantasy baseball year!

The draft was last night, and it went as well as could be expected. I had the 5th pick. I missed out on a few players I wanted but hey, them's the breaks. Here's a position-by-position breakdown of my draft strategy, with the player's average draft position in parenthesis. Bolded players are ones I drafted.

**Catcher**

1. **M. Wieters (275)**
2. M. Montero (1069)
3. M. Zunino (1137)

Yeah, my options were a bit limited here. Wieters is the guy, but at least I was able to wait until the 17th round to get him.

**First Base**

1. M. Cabrera (13)
2. **M. Carpenter (77)**
3. M. Holliday (168)
4. **M. Napoli (173)**
5. M. Moreland (300)
6. M. Gonzalez (462)

Although Carpenter has 1B eligibility in Yahoo, he's far more valuable at 2B and 3B so let's ignore him, because he's never going to play 1B for me. I was hoping Miggy would fall to me in the 2nd round, but sadly he did not, and I waited too long to grab Holliday. So Napoli is my first baseman. I'm still not sure how I feel about that. 

**Second Base**

1. **M. Carpenter (77)**
2. M. Gonzalez (462)

Yeah, we're pretty weak on depth here. I reached for Carpenter and took him in the 3rd round. I feel confident with him holding down the position, but I sure hope I don't get stuck running Marwin Gonzalez out there if an injury happens. 

**Third Base**

1. **M. Machado (8)**
2. **M. Carpenter (77)**
3. **M. Franco (123)**
4. **M. Sano (145)**
5. M. Moustakas (205)
6. M. Gonzalez (462)

Third basemen for daaaaaaaaaaaaaays. Machado's gunna be my SS, and Carpenter is my 2B, so in reality this position belongs to Franco and Sano. I think Franco's poised for a big breakout year, and Sano should improve on his 2016 season, so I feel pretty damn good about taking them in the 9th and 10th rounds. 

**Short Stop**

1. **M. Machado (8)**
2. **M. Semien (226)**
3. M. Gonzalez (462)
4. M. Duffy (611)

It's the Machado show all day, every day. Snagged him with my first round pick, and then book-ended the draft by taking Semien with my last pick, just to have a backup. My entire draft strategy revolved around getting Machado, so after that everything was cake. 

**Outfield**

1. M. Trout (1)
2. M. Betts (2)
3. **M. Kemp (72)**
4. **M. Trumbo (88)**
5. M. Ozuna (134)
6. **M. Brantley (137)**
7. **M. Sano (145)**
8. M. Holliday (168)
9. M. Cabrera (217)
10. **M. Conforto (242**
11. M. Kepler (253)
12. M. Margot (301)
13. M. Upton (366)
14. M. Saunders (495)

Trout and Betts were never really on the table for me. After that things opened up pretty wide. Grabbed Kemp in the 4th round, Trumbo in the 6th, then Brantley in the 12th. Conforto I'm really just holding onto in case he has a big breakout year, because he's killin' it in spring training.

**Starting Pitching**

1. M. Scherzer (14)
2. M. Bumgarner (17)
3. **M. Tanaka	(74)**
4. **M. Fulmer	(113)**
5. **M. Harvey	(120)**
6. **M. Stroman (151)**
7. **M. Estrada (194)**
8. **M. Shoemaker (195)**
9. **M. Pineda	(201)**
10. M. Moore (219)
11. M. Leake (292)
12. **M. Foltynewicz (297)**
13. **M. Montgomery	(299)**
14. M. Andriese (317)

In all my mock drafts (six of them. Six!) I was able to grab one of Scherzer/Bumgarner in the 2nd round. So guess what happened on draft day? Both of them got snagged *right* before my 2nd pick. So I was forced to super-reach for Tanaka with my 2nd pick instead. But beyond that, I've got a lot of really solid pitching. This is going to be a quantity vs quality thing: with 9 starting pitchers hopefully I can win the three counting stats (Wins, Strikeouts, and Quality Starts) every week. 

**Relief Pitching**

1. **M. Melancon (142)**
2. **M. Bush (350)**
3. M. Lorenzen (532)
4. M. Cabrera 

Okay, so we've got a problem. Melancon is the only reliever with an M name. This was a problem because A) I needed to reach for him hard, in the 5th round, because I've seen him go much earlier than expected in my mock drafts, and B) it means I'm thin on depth. I drafted Matt Bush with the hope that he gets the closer job in Texas, and have my eyes on setup men Lorenzen and Cabrera in case their able to get promoted too. But otherwise, I'm not going to be winning Saves very much. I might even see if I can move Melancon and punt on Saves entirely. We'll see.

So that's the team. Other players I have my eye on are Martin Prado, Melvin Upton, Miguel Gonzalez, Mike Leake, and Matt Andriese. I'm sure there will be a lot of transactions as the year goes on. 

What'd I miss? Who is due for a breakout season that I should stash away in hopes of a big payoff? It's gunna be a long season, so I'll take all the help I can get from you guys. But it's going to be a fun (or at least entertaining) ride.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It may be dumb in hindsight, but it looked fine at the time.

1. At the time of the signing, he'd just finished seasons of 141, 130, and 171 OPS+, one of which was an MVP season. Over that time he slashed .313/.370/.583.
2. The contract was only 5 years long, ranging from age 31-36. Not terrible by any means. 
3. The contract was back-loaded, and is actually worth an average of $22 mil per year. Pretty shitty, but that puts him [ranked 23rd](http://www.spotrac.com/mlb/rankings/) in baseball, which is far from the worst. 

The Hamilton contract is bad. Don't get me wrong. But it's far from the worst, not least because it was only 5 years long. I don't think any contract that's only 5 years long can be called the worst.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Because I have seen male politicians and female politicians both attacked for their looks. It's pretty common to attack politicians based on their looks. Just look at any political cartoon.

To be clear: I'm not saying men don't get attacked for their looks. I'm saying women get attacked *more* for their looks. The double standard in this past election, with insane focus on Hillary's wardrobe compared to Trump's, was nuts. 

And come on. That article is from Monica Hesse from the "Style Section" of the Washington Post. That's not the same thing as someone with a political segment saying, "I'm going to ignore all of her policy because her hair looks stupid," which is why I was clear to limit my statement to journalists/news anchors.  </TEXT>

I don't know how you could possibly believe this.

I'm not hand-waving *any* attack on men's appearances. There are obviously plenty of such attacks that would be inappropriate.

I am, however, waving off the mention of Trump's hair. *People* make fun of his hair, but I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a journalist/news anchor (is that even what you can call O'Reilly?) doing such during a live news segment.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a beginner golfer who just started playing last fall. I typically shoot around 100. 

My biggest problem is my consistency devolves as the day goes on. I'll "find" my swing at the driving range while warming up, play consistently well for the first 8-9 holes, and then fall apart after about 3 hours. Suddenly I can't hit the ball flush. I don't think it's a fitness thing; I'm not *tired* on the back 9, I just feel like the muscle memory disappears and I can't find my swing.

Is this normal for beginners? Is there any way to improve on this, or will regular practice slowly help me get over it?  </TEXT>

Obviously there's a difference since Benghazi was all BS and this is a legitimate investigation, but to them it's the same idea.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to play devil's advocate and defend the pitcher.

There's a phenomenon called visual fixation where, when watching something, the body will physically react in that direction. It's common in driving or cycling: you see a hazard on the road ahead like a piece of tire or trash, and it becomes difficult to avoid it because the brain is still focused on it, even though you logically know you need to move to avoid it. Same for it you stare at something on the side of the road: you'll start to drift in that direction. I'm a cyclist, and it's amazing how focusing on something with your eyes can paralyze you from other physical decision-making.

I could see that being the case for this pitcher: batter suddenly moves, pitcher follows him with his eyes, and then throws in that direction. In the video, the entire thing happens in about a quarter of a second: the batter doesn't start moving until the pitcher's hand is already pulled back. 

Or he's a dick trying to hit a guy out of spite. Could be that too.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-01-25 15:55:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **SPOILERS BELOW**. 

I really hate criticizing fellow authors, but I just don't have much good to say about this book. There are a lot of fun 1980s reference, but beyond that the book has very little going for it. I struggled to finish, and only did so out of an obligation of completeness. 

The plot is bland and predictable: an unexpected boy is the one to find the first "key" to The OASIS puzzle. The characters are one-dimensional and have no real development. The protagonist eases his way through the book without any real strife, succeeding in a never-ending series of deus-ex-machina style skills:

* "To get the first key you had to beat the Skeleton King at the game Joust. Fortunately, I'm the best in the world at it and win on the first try!"
* "To complete the first gate I had to reenact the entire War Games movie. Fortunately, I've watched it a billion times and know all the lines by heart!"
* "To get the one-up coin I had to play a perfect game of Pac-Man, something only 5 people have ever done in history! Even though I'm rusty at my Pac-Man skills, I become the 6th person after just a few hours."
* "To get the second key I had to beat the game Zork. Fortunately, I know the game by heart!"
* "To pass through the second gate I had to reenact the movie Blade Runner. Fortunately, I know the movie by heart!"

It's that sort of thing, repeated over and over. There's never any struggle, strife, or hardship, beyond the first ten pages of the book where the protagonist's living quarters are described (which stops being an issue a few pages later when he's suddenly famous and rich). 

Plot issues aside, the writing disappointed me. It's extremely "telly" (as opposed to showy). The pacing is strange and frustrating: Cline will spend pages and pages describing something unimportant, like the posters on the wall of their chat room. Then, when we reach an important part of the story (such as reaching the Dungeon where the first key resides) he'll skip past all of the action with a single "I completed the dungeon and reached the final room," type sentence. It's maddening. 

Overall, the simplicity of the story and the quality of the writing make this book feel like a Middle Grade book masquerading as adult fiction. I think it will do much better as a movie (which is due out in 2018), but as for the book, you can get the same experience merely by reading a list of 1980s movies and videogames from wikipedia. 

I don't know what I expected with this book, but it's certainly not what I got.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Michael Crichton, Westworld, and his motivations behind writing Jurassic Park (from a speech I saw him give in 2003) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-22 02:17:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I saw [this thread](http://i.imgur.com/RanqxE1.jpg) about how Westworld is just a reboot of Jurassic Park, and it made me realize that not everyone has probably heard Crichton's comments on the work. Here's what I can most accurately remember from seeing Crichton speak on it back when he was alive.

Back in the early 2000s, when he was close to releasing *State of Fear*, Michael Crichton came to my high school in Virginia. He was promoting his book, and gave a big speech in our auditorium about the present lackings of scientific peer review and stuff like that (for those that don't know, sadly, *State of Fear* is essentially a climate change denial book). 

Afterwards, he did Q/A. One of the questions was about Jurassic Park. "Were you always a big amateur paleontologist?" someone asked. "Was that your motivation for writing Jurassic Park?" 

He laughed and said that no, it wasn't. He told a story about how back in the 1980s he got together with an old college friend who was in town for drinks. After catching up with him, when they were several drinks in, the friend started talking about his movie debut, Westworld. How it was a great film, etc etc. "I told him I considered it my masterpiece," Crichton said. He explained that it crushed him to see it get such terrible reviews from critics that didn't 'get it' (even though it later got a sequel). He lamented that it was way ahead of its time. 

So the friend jokes, "You should rewrite it, but replace the robots with something people can appreciate. Like dinosaurs." Crichton spread his arms to us, the auditorium full of kids, and said, "I started writing the book the next day." 

I don't know if what he said was true, or if he came up with a funny embellishment to cover up the fact that he essentially rewrote one of his previous works and changed the protagonists (from hosts to dinosaurs), but that's what he told my high school back in ~2003. 

Has anyone heard the same from an interview at some point? I would imagine it's something he's said more than once, but I can't find anything on the internet.  </TEXT>

So I was out playing yesterday, me and another guy. We play the first hole, and are putting on the green when a foursome comes riding up the golf cart path behind us. I'm wondering what the hell they're doing, and they go right past us and straight to Hole #2. They skipped the first hole entirely.

We then spent the entire day stuck behind these guys. They were *really* slow players, taking a lot of mulligans and farting around on the green. And skipping us didn't affect much: there was another group ahead of them, which they were constantly bumping up against too.

It wasn't a big deal because it was a gorgeous day yesterday, and I shrugged it off and enjoyed my game, but it did make me wonder. Is there a reason they skipped us on the first hole? Is that a thing that happens sometimes? Were they dicks for doing that as a foursome?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll spare you the drama and get right to the sad point: [we lost.](http://i.imgur.com/lRRwlTo.png) And not by much! 

My opponent had *five Red Sox on his team*: Ortiz, Betts, Hanley, JBJ, and Sandy Leon. For the beginning of the week, they destroyed me. I was immediately down in all hitting categories.

But my pitchers played [like Greek heroes](http://i.imgur.com/JqAbJWZ.png). A 2.77 ERA from a roster that was going for quantity, not quality? Well okay then. By Thursday I had all the pitching categories locked up except Saves, so I ended up benching my starters. Slowly, I began catching up in the hitting categories. Going into Saturday, I was leading 7-5! 

So what killed me? A few things.

* On the final day, my team batted .241, causing me to lose AVG. Swell.
* We were tied in SB going into Sunday, so I [benched Justin Turner for Jason Kipnis](http://i.imgur.com/s7wrbZ0.png). See that Run Turner scored on Sunday? That would have broken the tie in that category and single-handedly won me the week.
* Jeanmar Gomez blew two saves and lost the closer's role. If he makes either of those saves, I win. 
* After consistently getting me 1-2 steals per week, Jean Segura didn't get any this week. He also batted .182, and only got me 1 Run and 1 RBI. Way to suck at the worst time, buddy. 

The heartbreaking part? I owned the tiebreaker against my opponent (regular season H2H record), so if we finished tied 6-6 then I would have still won. Any of those things go my way and we're having a different conversation right now. 

Ahh, well. So it goes.

It was a *really* fun year. This kind of team forces a lot of creativity, and kept me interested in the fantasy season much longer than I otherwise would have been. 

Hopefully you guys enjoyed the updates. I'll probably do something similar next year, so look for me come Spring.

<TITLE> J-Walking, A Fantasy Baseball Experiment: SPECIAL PLAYOFF EDITION - ROUND ONE </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-15 21:00:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We've come a long way since I drafted a team entirely made up of guys with names beginning in J. That seemed like so long ago. A more lighthearted time, filled with laughter and joy. Things weren't so serious back then. Because make no mistake: things are serious now. This isn't a game. 

We've reached the fantasy baseball playoffs. The cream has risen to the top, my friends. And the J-Walkers are [*creamy as fuck*](http://i.imgur.com/xE4QCcY.png).

I missed out on the Regular Season Championship by half a game, but that's okay. I still get a bye week to sit on my hands and think about how best to not screw things up.

I'd like to take a moment and savor the team stats over the course of the season because, gosh darnit, the J-Walkers deserve it.

[**HITTING**](http://i.imgur.com/UhaaCPG.png)

* R: 801 (2nd)
* HR: 237 (2nd)
* RBI: 796 (2nd)
* SB: 87 (6th)
* TB: 2,602 (1st)
* AVG: .286 (1st)

[**PITCHING**](http://i.imgur.com/vT8fg3L.png)

* W: 82 (4th)
* SV: 97 (2nd)
* K: 1,228 (4th) 
* ERA: 3.86 (6th)
* WHIP: 1.26 (6th) 
* QS: 114 (3rd)

Look at those offensive stats. *Look at them*.  It's just so goddamn beautiful. 

Alright. [Here's what the team looks like](http://i.imgur.com/2eMjlSv.png) going into the playoffs next week. A few notes:

* Yeah, Josh Donaldson is injured. Yeah, it sucks. Yeah, it's keeping me up at night right now.
* Quantity over Quality is the name of the pitching game. I'm hoping to take W, K, and QS by sheer numbers, and then win most of the offensive stats. As such, I'll probably be streaming some really shitty pitchers: Jon Gray, Jimmy Nelson, Jose Urena, Jake Peavy. I've got 5 transactions I can make per week, and you bet your ass I'm gunna make them. It's gunna get ugly, but you know what? War ain't supposed to be pretty.
* With that in mind, I'm *considering* punting on Saves and dropping my two closers in favor of more SPs. All of my future playoff opponents have 3 or 4 closers, so it's not a stat I'm likely to win. What do you guys think? 
* I'm lucky that I have very few aces on my team, because it means nobody will have their starts cancelled in order to set a favorable playoff schedule. Jon Lester's the only one I'm concerned with at all, and that won't come into play for another two weeks. 

This is it, folks. Who should I be keeping an eye on for the playoffs? Who's super hot right now? How can we pull this off?  </TEXT>

We're getting down to the last few weeks of the season. It's crunch time. Last week I had a critical head-to-head matchup against the #2 team in the league, over whom I had a 1.5 game lead. The good news? I whooped him 9-3. (Woo!) The bad news? The other guy tied with him for 2nd place won his matchup 11-1, so he [passed me for 1st place](http://i.imgur.com/s99ThuA.png). (Boo!)

But hey, I'm still up there. Sticking to the front of the standings like a squirrel holding onto the back of a velociraptor. 

Last week was the trade deadline for the league. Desperate for pitching, I targeted three players for acquisition: Jose Fernandez, Jake Arrieta, and Jacob deGrom. I have a surplus of offensive players, so I made trade offers to each of the owners. Usually a mix of Joey Votto, Jose Abreu, Jean Segura, Jay Bruce, and Jake Lamb. 

The result? The three owners never respond to my offers, even when I direct-messaged them. All three are active owners, and all three had offensive needs. I never even got so much as a trade decline. Just silence. I can only assume that my fantasy team is the super hot cheerleader of the league, who would love to be invited out by a nice, shy guy to go see *You've Got Mail* (the Joey Votto of romantic comedies) and maybe get to second base with, but they're too intimidated by her good looks to ask. 

Oh well. Looks like this is the J-Walkers team we're going to have to ride into the playoffs (except for adds/drops):

[**Hitting**](http://i.imgur.com/4U2gnuW.png)

[**Pitching**](http://i.imgur.com/zXmKTWf.png)

My strategy is to hopefully blow teams away on offensive categories, and win the pitching categories by sheer numbers alone (W, K, and QS). Hence all the pitchers. 

**THE GOOD**

* JD Martinez finally came back from the DL and hit the ground running: hitting .441, with 6 HR and 55 TB in just 68 AB. Boy do I need that down the stretch.
* The two tiny SS that I acquired just to survive until Kang got off the DL? Jean Segura and Jose Ramirez? *They're both leading the team in TB over the last month*. A combined 41 R, 9 HR, 27 RBI, 21 SB over that stretch. 
* My pitching is holding its own. Lester, Taillon, Verlander, Odorizzi, and Hellickson all have ERAs in the 2.XX range over the past month, and have a combined 15 wins and 22 QS over that stretch. 

**THE BAD**

* Jay Bruce has sucked since moving to New York. Lots of dingers, and not much else. 
* Jon Gray. Yikes. 
* Jake Barrett has decided to suck: 10 runs over his last 7.1 innings. I swear to Jesus/Allah/FSM/Tom Cruise, if he loses the closer's role in Arizona I'm going to buy a table just so I can flip it.

**THE UGLY**

* Jim Johnson is losing his closer spot to Vizcaino, so I'm back down to two closers (one of whom is the above-mentioned Barrett). Here's hoping Jeffress earns the closer's spot in Texas. 
* Jake Lamb is a bad baseball player. I should drop him, but I'm holding on out of sheer stubbornness. 
* In non-fantasy news: I moved to Texas two months ago. Since coming here, I've been to 8 Rangers games. They've lost every one. What the shit? 

Another notable move: I picked up Josh Bell last week, even though he was still sitting in AAA. He was called up a few days later. Hooray for me!

**COMING UP**: in the final three weeks of the regular season I play the #7, #12, and #8 players in the league. So I have a favorable schedule. Six teams make the playoffs, so the #1 and #2 seeds get a buy in the first round. That would be super terrific.

What'd I miss? Are there any awesome J-name September call-ups I should grab now?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Background info here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/4c3fl3/jwalking_a_fantasy_baseball_experiment/)

I was out of town last week (at RAGBRAI), so I set my lineup and left it, even though I was playing the first place team in our league. The result? [Whooped him 9-1](http://i.imgur.com/ArekHo2.png), which propels me into 2nd place and only 0.5 games back of 1st. 

The J-Walkers are alive and well, friends.

It's been a busy trade deadline for the team. Jonathan Lucroy, Jay Bruce, Josh Reddick, and Jeremy Jeffress were all traded to new teams. Hopefully playing on contenders will up their value! 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/OaPjqAY.png) are the other moves I've made. Lots of adding/dropping of potential closers, like Joakim Soria, Jim Johnson, and Jake Barrett. How's the team done aside from that?

**THE GOOD**

* Joey titty-fucking Votto. Hitting a Williamsesque .406 over the past month. Trading Familia for him is looking like a good move for me right now.
* Justin Turner. Leading my team in HR, RBI, and TB over the past 30 days.
* My pitching staff was great in July. James Paxton with an ERA of  3.55. Justin Verlander at 1.77. Jameson Taillon at 3.00. 

**THE BAD**

* Jake Lamb is taking his ASG snub poorly, hitting .229 over the past 30 days. I guess the ride couldn't last forever.
* What happened to Jon Lester? 7.36 ERA over the past month. Oof.
* JD Martinez is still out, but he's beginning a rehab assignment today. I could use that power back in my lineup.

**THE UGLY**

* Julio Urias. Wasted a lot of transactions just for a few of his crappy spot starts. Meh.
* RIP Jake McGee, who sucked as a closer, occupied a DL slot for a month, and then came back and lost his closer's role.
* Jung Ho Kang is another guy. I drafted him early and held him in a DL slot *all season long* because I knew he'd be a big part of my team, and then he goes and rapes someone. What a dick. (We can all agree I'm the real victim here, right?) All jokes aside, I dropped him when the news broke earlier this month, and he's done terrible since then. Good move for me. Eat a buffet of dicks, Kang. 

What'd I miss? Any good fall call-ups with J-names getting ready to hit the show?  </TEXT>

It's not funny anymore. It's not a game anymore. Shit has gotten real, much in the same way that World War One marked when wars stopped being a gentlemanly sport for monarchs and started to be an *oh god why is his face melting off like that you didn't tell me chemical warfare was the stuff of nightmares* kind of real. 

I'm still doing well, and it's terrifying.

The J-Walkers are [holding strong in 2nd place](http://i.imgur.com/6r7LQzZ.png). Over the past 5 weeks I've gone 7-4, 6-5, 9-3, 9-2, and 9-2. I keep waiting for the wheels to fall off, and somehow, with duct tape and determination and guys like Jake Lamb, they're refusing to. 

**Current team (2016 stats): [Hitting](http://i.imgur.com/ZX8bOrd.png) - [Pitching](http://i.imgur.com/ic930On.png)**

**The Good**

* Joey Votto. That guy I traded Jeurys Familia for? He's finally kicking ass, hitting .312 with 6 HR (and 5 SB!) over the past month. 
* Josh Donaldson is no longer sucking bags of maple flavored shit. Batting .347 over the last month with the second most TB on the team.
* The most TB on the team over that span? Jay Bruce. 9 HR, 29 RBI over the past month. Get it, dude. 
* Jon Lester has a 1.46 ERA in his last 5 starts. So, I've got that going for me. Unlike...

**The Bad**

* ...the rest of the pitching staff. [Look at these assholes over the past 30 days](http://i.imgur.com/GmqqSus.png). *Look at them*. It's a parade of mediocrity, with Julio Urias carrying the baton like he earned the damn thing.
* Jake McGee is on the DL, limiting me to two closers. And he might not even keep the closer role when he returns. Positional J-scarcity sucks. I tried acquiring Jonathan Papelbon (who is also on the DL) but the owner wasn't biting. 
* Remember when Jackie Bradley Jr was good at the baseball? Pepperidge Farm remembers. 
* Josh Reddick and JD Martinez have been on the DL, forcing me to use Jose Ramirez in an OF slot. Thankfully, Reddick returns from the DL today. 

**The Ugly**

* Farewell Jimmy Nelson and your 4.93 FIP. 
* I dropped Jeremy Hellickson. Since then he's pitched two quality starts. Whelp.

I've tried to acquire Jose Bautista, but the owner is AFK in the league. Also made runs at Jose Fernandez and Jake Arrieta, but the prices are (justifiably) too high. 

My strategy from here on out is balls-to-the-wall offense. I've accepted my shitty pitching staff. If I can win 5-6 of the Hitting categories, and snipe one or two accumulation Pitching stats (like K or SV) then I think I can stand a chance for the remainder of the season.

Alright. Anything I'm missing? Are there any J-diamonds in the rough I should be snagging while I can? </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) How Jon will discover... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-20 12:15:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ...his true parentage.

There are a lot of ways Jon could find out about his parentage. The most common theories:

* Howland Reed (last living survivor from Tower of Joy)
* Rhaegar's Harp on Lyanna's crypt
* Someone else tells him (Littlefinger?)
* Bran Weirwood.net discovery, then tells Jon

So, this last episode made it clear he's going down into the crypts to bury Rickon. At first, I assumed this meant Littlefinger would find a way to tell him, or he finds the harp. 

However, something occurred to me: **what if Jon has his own crypt hidden down there?**

They find a previously unexplored area, or a rarely used section. Jon finds a crypt with a headless statue, since the stonemasons would need to wait until later to do the face. Or hell, maybe it's a small baby statue hidden behind Lyanna's crypt. Anyways, they'll find *something*. Jon's confused, until he reads the words carved into the base:

"Jon, first of his name, trueborn son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark."

This would neatly resolve several questions:

1. Who are Jon's parents?
2. Did Rhaegar and Lyanna marry prior to his birth?
3. And the most important part: how can the characters discover, *beyond a reasonable doubt*, the above two?

A crypt that Ned Stark had carved does all three. It would remove all doubt, unlike any of the other methods Jon could discover his parentage. Littlefinger can even be there to fill in some extra details. "Your *uncle*, Ned Stark, had this made. He intended to show you when you were old enough." Shit, Davos can even give some Stannis perspective. "Stannis was shocked the Kingsguard weren't at Dragonstone..."

The entire thing makes far more sense than a vague harp on a crypt, or Jon finding out second-hand from someone else, and the scene would mirror one of the first scenes of the show: Ned and Robert going to the crypts to pay respects to Lyanna. 

**TL;DR**: Jon has a crypt beneath Winterfell that specifically names his parents.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**BACKGROUND HERE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/4c3fl3/jwalking_a_fantasy_baseball_experiment/)

It's been a while since I gave an update, so you're probably wondering how my J-name master race team is doing. Well wonder no more! In the past 6 weeks, I've had 2 *awful* weeks, 2 average weeks, and 2 great weeks, and am still holding strong in 2nd place. The guy in 1st is just crushing it right now, so I'm happy to be holding on. [Here's what the standings look like.](http://i.imgur.com/L1AGdr5.png)

So what do the J-Walkers look like right now? 

* [**HITTING**](http://i.imgur.com/Qq6MY0E.png)
* [**PITCHING**](http://i.imgur.com/aOK6nGK.png)

**The Good**

* Jackie Fucking Bradley Jr. I picked him up just before his streak, and boy did that pay off. He's leading the entire team in TB, despite missing about a week for the birth of his daughter. Me gusta.
* Jung Ho Kang came off the DL and has wasted no time kicking ass. Just in time for Jean Segura's inevitable decline, too. 
* Jonathan Lucroy is hitting .417 in the last 30 days. What the shit? I don't even care if his BABIP says it's not sustainable. His .316/.372/.539 slash for the year gives me a big 'ol fantasy erection.

**The Bad**

* What the fuck is wrong with Josh Donaldson? Hitting .216 over the last month, dead-last in TB over that stretch and with the second fewest RBI. Get your shit together.
* Same goes for you, Jose Abreu. I'm not paying you to hit fewer homeruns than Kang in 3x as many at-bats. 
* Oh, and I bought low on Joey Votto about a month ago, trading Jeurys Familia for the slugger while his value was at his lowest. It hasn't worked out so far, but he's finally showing signs of turning it around over the past week. 

**The Ugly** (players dropped in the past month)

* Julio Urias. Ugh. Even his name sounds like urine.
* Jesse Hahn
* Junior Guerra
* Jose Berrios

Going forward, I've got a really solid team. I'm holding strong in the standings despite hugely disappointing seasons from three of my biggest sluggers (Abreu/Votto/Donaldson), so as soon as they get back to normal I'm going to be locked and loaded. 

J the force be with you.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> After Manfred's comments on Mexico City, I decided to run the data on flight times from each franchise's city. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-06 20:18:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One of the biggest complaints I've seen mentioned about a Mexico City expansion team is the horrendous travel required. So for funsies I did the math. Here's the flight time from each city to Mexico City, compared with flight time to Seattle (in parenthesis). I've bolded all cities where a flight to Mexico City is faster, or equal to, a flight to Seattle. 

* **Houston: 2:10 (4:40)**
* **Dallas: 2:30 (4:00)**
* Phoenix: 3:00 (2:50)
* **Miami: 3:25 (6:40)**
* **Tampa: 3:25 (6:20)**
* San Diego: 3:30 (2:45)
* Los Angeles: 3:35 (2:30)
* Denver: 3:35 (2:40)
* **Atlanta: 3:35 (5:10)**
* **Kansas City: 3:40 (3:40)**
* **St Louis: 3:45 (4:10)**
* San Francisco: 4:15 (1:55)
* **Chicago: 4:15 (4:20)**
* **Detroit: 4:40 (4:45)**
* **Toronto: 4:40 (5:15)**
* **New York: 4:45 (6:00)**
* **Philadelphia: 4:45 (5:50)**
* **Baltimore: 4:55 (5:35)**
* **Washington, DC: 4:55 (5:35)**
* **Boston: 6:10 (6:05)**

(I excluded Minneapolis, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Milwaukee because they didn't have direct flight info. But comparing to other nearby cities, they should all be equal or better flight times to Mexico City than Seattle). 

Conclusion: if you're in the NL West then your trip to Mexico City is worse than Seattle, but for *literally every other team in the country* it's an equal or easier flight. North/south traveling is much easier than east/west. 

Carry on.

**DISCLAIMER**: I'm not saying a Mexico City expansion team is a great idea. Merely commenting on the travel times involved.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two weeks ago I [created a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/4c3fl3/jwalking_a_fantasy_baseball_experiment/) about drafting a team comprised entirely of players whose named begin with the letter 'J'. A lot of people expressed interest in getting some regular updates throughout the season, so I figured I'd fill you guys in on how things are going. 

Well, it was a fun gimmick while it lasted. Obviously, fielding a team entirely of J-named players isn't something that can have long term success in a--

First round pick Josh Donaldson is obviously carrying the team in R/HR/RBI, but beyond that much of my success is due to Jean Segura. Yeah, *that guy*, the one I drafted solely because he was one of my few J-name options at shortstop, who I only hoped could keep the spot warm until Kang got off the DL. The glory will surely fade, but for now I'll smugly smile and pretend it was all part of the plan.

Beyond that, I really need JD Martinez and Jose Abreu to start producing. These were my 2nd and 3rd round picks, and I'm lucky to be leading the league with their sub-par performances. 

[**PITCHING**](http://imgur.com/r4evL8C)

Right now, I'm running four closers. Mostly because I need the depth in case there are any injuries or demotions. And also because the promotions of Jeanmar Gomez and Jeremy Jeffress were gifts bestowed upon me by the baseball gods. These guys are killin' it. If I had known they'd be closers I wouldn't have reached for Familia. 

Starter-wise, I'm getting by. Zimmerman, Lester, and Ross are a fantastic core group. Odorizzi is great. Beyond that though... lots of question marks. I hope Berrios can improve (his last start looked promising). Verlander, Nelson, and Happ... I'm expecting them to regress (or continue doing poorly, in Verlander's case). So I'll ride them a bit longer and see how it goes. Since half the pitching stats are counting stats favoring lots of starters (W, K, QS) I want to be rolling as many guys out there as possible. 

[**TRANSACTIONS**](http://imgur.com/VzremXa)

Ahh, look at all those J-names coming and going. Joey Rickard was solid for a while, until deciding to suck. Jake Lamb's been a great pick-up. I expected big things from Schoop this season, so it was tough to part with him, but with Kipnis already manning 2B he was redundant. 

Things are rocking. Things are rolling.

So that's where we're at. What'd I miss? What J-sleepers are out there I should take a chance at? 

We've reach the point where this is no longer a game, guys. I can't just laugh this off anymore when I end up at the bottom of the standings. Shit's serious, now. *I need to win this*. 

**UPDATE**: just traded Jeurys Familia for Joey Votto. That'll help bolster my offense a bunch.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two weeks ago I [created a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/4c3fl3/jwalking_a_fantasy_baseball_experiment/) about drafting a team comprised entirely of players whose named begin with the letter 'J'. A lot of people expressed interest in getting some regular updates throughout the season, so I figured I'd write up a post. Mods, let me know if this isn't allowed. 

So. Where do The J-Walkers stand after the first week of the season?

[In 2nd goddamn place.](http://imgur.com/hZ2JmU6)

At 8-4, The J-Walkers [did better than I expected](http://imgur.com/T3j9O1n). They won 4 of the 6 batting categories (all but SB and AVG), and 4 of the 6 pitching categories (all but ERA and WHIP). But they did pretty darn good in ERA and WHIP, going 3.16 and 1.09, respectively. The offense also batted .316, but my opponent averaged .335. Ahh, well.

An ERA of 3.16, and a batting average of .316. Yeah. You know who else had a J-name? Jesus. 

Some notes:

* Josh Donaldson is looking like a great first-round pick, anchoring the offense with 4 HR, 8 R, and 9 RBI.
* Jean Segura was the hero this week. A late-draft pick solely because of his J-power, who I was hoping could squeak by until Jung Ho Kang returns, Segura batted .407 with 3 dingers, 5 RBI, and 2 SB. **He led the entire team with 24 touched bases.** Goddamn.
* Jay Bruce was another late-draft surprise, hitting a pair of HR and knocking in 9 RBI.
* On the pitching side, the rotation was anchored by great performances from Jon Lester, Jake Odorizzi, Joe Ross, and Jimmy Nelson. Joe Kelly is the only Starting Pitcher in my rotation that shit the bed, currently holding a 21.00 ERA and a 3.33 WHIP.
* My 3-headed closing trio of Jeurys Familia, Jeremy Jeffress, and Jake McGee combined for 6 saves and an ERA of 1.50. 
* I'm [leading all teams](http://imgur.com/MlURlv8) in R, HR, RBI, TB, and QS, and I'm 2nd in AVG and SV. Glorious J-name Master Race. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I usually just play one fantasy baseball league, but this year I decided to play in a second for funsies. 12 teams, H2H. We had the draft on Friday. Here's how the first few rounds went:

**Round One**: I had the 5th pick, so I took Josh Donaldson. Nothing fancy.

**Round Two**: 20th pick. I felt good about grabbing Jose Abreu here, as the 1B depth drops off pretty quickly.

**Round Three**: I think the Tigers are going to be a big offensive team in 2016, so I snagged JD Martinez. 

At this point I was sitting there, admiring my dinger-hitting lineup, when I noticed something on the Yahoo Draft board. 

* C: 
* 1B: J Abreu
* 2B: 
* 3B: J Donaldson
* SS: 
* OF: J Martinez
* OF: 
* OF: 
* UTIL: 
* UTIL: 

Wait. What?

J. J. J.

That's funny. All the guys on my team have names starting with J.

For a moment, I considered laughing it off. Just a funny coincidence. But... what if?

There were three more players before my next pick. I frantically searched the remaining players with J names. Justin Upton. Jason Kipnis. You know what pitchers have J names? *All the best pitchers have J names*. Arrieta, deGrom, Fernandez. There was a lot of talent there. It could work. It could totally fucking work.

I started to sweat. My pick was coming up. Jason Kipnis was at the top of the J-list, and he was one of the few viable J second basemen (the next was Jonathan Schoop, averaging pick 275), so I nabbed him.

That raised the question of positional J-scarcity. Who did I need to target to make this work? The biggest problem immediately became apparent: Catcher. Catchers have really shitty names (Buster? Seriously?), and only one within the Top 20 had a J-name: [Jonathan Lucroy](http://imgur.com/qgX8mSI). At this point in the draft, Posey and Schwarber had both been drafted, so Jonathan Lucroy was sitting there at the top of the available catcher list. His Average Draft Position was in the 100s, but shit, I needed to grab him soon. The whole thing would fall apart without him.

My computer dinged. It was my pick in the 5th round. This marked the point of no return.

I grabbed Jonathan Lucroy with pick #53, about 60 picks ahead of where he was averaging. Someone made a surprised comment in the chat. If only they knew. 

I sorted the list of players by name and began filling up my roster. Jon Lester? Easy pick. Jeurys Familia? Get the fuck in here. I started thinking of J-related puns for a team name. It was happening.

[Behold, the J-Walkers.](http://imgur.com/a/ERtQW) SS is my weakest position (Jean Segura was the first J-name, way down around pick 200) but aside from that it's a surprisingly solid team. 

We'll see how the season goes. A few key injuries will destroy the team's viability, but hey, fuck it. If there's any interest in seeing the progress of the experiment throughout the season, I'll post it. 

Glorious J-name Master Race. 

(PS: if anyone has a good J-pun for a team name, I'd love to hear it. "J The Force Be With You" was too long for Yahoo.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> #Siege of Praetar

###by David Kristoph

Paperback **|** Science Fiction **|** 169 pages **|** December 2014 **|** $9.99

##Blurb

The red giant Saria is dying. 

Praetar, a sand-blown planet, lies occupied. Its people are buried and beaten, forced to toil for the Melisao Empire that prepares to flee their star. Hyken, a Sentinel pilot in orbit around the planet, is faced with a moral dilemma that forces him to choose between his co-pilot and their mission. Mira, a factory worker on Praetar, struggles to make a better life for her daughters--using what little resources at her command. A slumlord named Bruno makes his own arrangements, gathering what meager power he can in the Empire's scramble to flee. 

Caught up in the exodus, these people struggle to survive. Are they strangers, or do their decisions affect one-another in unexpected ways? 


##A note from the author

This was my debut novel, published in December 2014. The novel won Honorable Mention in the Writers of the Future Context, and has been reviewed by [Publisher's Weekly](http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-5031-2808-8):

 "Kristoph skillfully connects three independent perspectives to demonstrate how an individual choice, whether self-serving or for the greater good, can create a ripple of consequences in unexpected ways." **-Publisher's Weekly**

<TITLE> Trying to buy tickets to UFC 197. Confused about pricing. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-21 15:00:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm going to be in Vegas while UFC 197 is occurring, so I'm looking to buy tickets. I signed up for the premium club, which allowed me to buy tickets yesterday. When registering, it says tickets will be as low as $200. 

However, when I go to buy the tickets, the cheapest ones (up in the worst seats) are $454.

General sale happens tomorrow at noon. My question: should I go ahead and buy these tickets for $454, or should I wait until tomorrow? Will the price go down? Should I wait until closer to the event to buy tickets secondhand? I've never purchased UFC tickets before, so I'm not aware of how the general ticket price trends are.

Thanks for the help!

**UPDATE**: after refreshing the page every hour, a bunch of cheaper tickets suddenly became available. Bought 'em for $300 after tax. Thanks guys! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've noticed a lot of people making comments like: "Why is Teresa's brother making statements every single day? He sure likes to hear himself talk! Seems suspicious."

Typically with a high-profile case like this, the family will make a deal with the media. They'll say, "We are making X the representative for the family, and he will give 10 minutes of interviews every single day. In exchange, the media will not bother the rest of the family, will not attempt to talk to them or ask them any questions about the trial."

This is why nobody else in the Halbach family is interviewed at all, why he was constantly being shown, and why the media was calm with him. Compare this to the Dassey family, where the media was chasing Barb out of the courtroom to question/film her.

This is pretty normal for a case like this. Now, you can theorize about the *content* of what he said, but him speaking to the media shouldn't be considered suspicious. 

**DISCLAIMER**: I am in no way defending Mike Halbach or making comments regarding the innocence/guilt of Steve Avery, just providing some clarification as to why Mike was constantly speaking to the media.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Shireen reading Dance of Dragons last episode isn't just a neat little reference thrown in for fun. I think it's hinting at what will come. The part about Swann attempting to sneak up/capture the dragon is obviously a reference to Quentyn; since he's cut from the show this will probably happen to Jorah or Daario. 

But I'd like to focus on the second part of her reading, the part she explains to her father Stannis. 

 Shireen: "It's about a Targaryan civil war, when Rhaenyra and Aegon II fought over the throne."

This sounds strangely similar to a book plot: the Dornish plot to crown Myrcella over her brother Tommen in AFFC. This has been cut in the show, however... or has it?

The show has merged plotlines whenever possible. I still believe Doran Martell has something up his sleeve; so far we haven't found out what it is, other than that he's simply sending Myrcella back to King's Landing. There has to be more. I believe the show is merging two plots from AFFC/ADWD:

* Doran's Fire and Blood plan (sending Quentyn to marry Dany)
* Arianna's plan to crown Myrcella as Queen

Doran Martell is going to declare Myrcella as Queen and send her back to King's Landing (or, alternatively, Trysane will do it once they arrive). 

I refuse to believe show!Doran has no secret plan; it's crucial to his character, crucial to the entire Dorne storyline. Crowning Myrcella combines these two plotlines reasonably well, and explains all of Doran's motivations up to this point. We've seen that Myrcella is completely taken with her fiancee; it's plausible that she would go along with this, especially if they convinced her Tommen could be removed peacefully.

**TLDR; Doran is the grass, and Myrcella is the snake.**

**BONUS TINFOIL TIME**: Doran's insistence on sending Trystane back to King's Landing with Myrcella is more than it seems. From the Dance of the Dragons wiki:

 [The war] saw the deaths of both rival monarchs, and the crowning of  Aegon III.

What if show!Trystane is actually Aegon/fAegon? It would explain Doran's insistence on showing peace, so he could set Aegon up. It would insert what is an otherwise important (we think) book character back into the show. It would add a level of depth to Oberyn's death: he died getting revenge for one murder which never actually occurred.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Hiring] Looking for someone to design the cover of a Sci-Fi eBook </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-25 17:34:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm almost done writing a sci-fi novella, and I'm looking for someone to design a sweet eBook cover. This is a one-time request, but there are several more novellas to follow, so there may be an opportunity to do several more.
The story is about a civilization leaving their star system (because the star is dying), so the cover would need to spacey. Something like two ships in orbit over a planet, one firing missiles at another. Obviously more details will come later, but wanted to give a general idea here in the OP.
Price negotiable, but keep in mind it's a first-time eBook. If you have a portfolio that's a huge plus, or any other way to confirm that you're legitimate.

PM me or reply in the thread if you're interested.

**EDIT**: I'm looking for something like [this](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs45/f/2009/153/9/a/07_EG1___Spaceship_by_ehaft.jpg) style. The grittier, the better.

**UPDATE:** I've chosen someone for the job. Thanks to everyone to PM'd me! There's tons of great talent here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My title: "Tales of a Dying Star", sci-fi short-stories about a civilization leaving their solar system.

Existing title: ["Tales of the Dying Earth"](http://www.amazon.com/Tales-Dying-Earth-Jack-Vance/dp/0312874561), came out decades ago.

Friendly reminder to you guys to do a google search before settling on a title. I'm only 25% done with my WIP, so it's not a huge deal, but it feels bad, man.  </TEXT>

It's a writing contest for short-stories, but they have a registration fee, so I'm wondering how legitimate it is. Has anyone heard of it? 

I mean, their submission email addresses are yahoo and hotmail. That doesn't inspire confidence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Here you go](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hs7IAApum8f71nROlBI25VA5idO7Ak6adFLeFE-adRE/edit?usp=sharing). Gimme dat brutal feedback. What I'm looking for:

* General flow: is the writing crisp? Are there any specific sentences where you fumbled in reading it (if that makes sense)?
* Are there any parts that didn't make sense, or need more clarity?
* Did it keep your interest the whole way through? Were there any parts that bored you?
* Any other general impressions.

I've disabled comments because the last submission I made I asked for no line edits, and got nothing but line edits anyways. My editor will be doing line-edits later this week, so really I'm just looking for general feedback. Thanks guys!

<TEXT> I went to bed last night a loser. My opponent and I were tied 7-7 in the semifinals, and he controlled the tiebreaker (head-to-head record). Every player was done, it was over.

But then I woke up this morning and saw the score:

What's this? How could this have happened? And then I saw the "stat correction" page:

Carlos Santana was awarded a SB in the game on September 18. This broke the tie in the SB category and gave me an 8-7 lead.

It's a fantasy baseball miracle. I'm playing in the Championship this week!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [7128] The Fisherman </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-08 21:03:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> FYI I created a new account for this subreddit so people could more easily look at my critique history.

I've already submitted a portion of this to /r/writing, and want some more "honest" feedback, whether good or bad. It's a fantasy series, the first chapter for this character but the fourth in the book. First draft, no real editing yet. What I'm looking for:

* Does the story 'hook' you? Do you want to learn more about this world?
* Does the writing flow/read well? 
* Are the characters interesting and believable? 
* What specific paragraphs do you like and dislike, and for what reasons?
* The hard truth: is it good? Do I have potential as a writer? It's tough to gauge your own writing, and I legitimately want to know if I have talent. Feel free to just give me a 'yes' or 'no', or a scale of 1-to-10, or however. 

I **don't** want line-by-line editing, please. That can come later. But feel free to make other comments in the document for general thoughts/remarks.
