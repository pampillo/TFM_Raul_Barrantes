<TEXT> Theres a place in hell where the walls have eyes and the soul withdraws in horror. In the land of 100,000 Hateful Eyes, theres no escape from the witness. The Insufferable Demigod sees everything. The 100,000 Hateful Eyes possess the power to vindicate the spirit or demolish it one sin at a time. Their strength is observance and judgment. The eyes are everywhere. They belong to the witness, but belong to us. We are the witness. Look into your soul and feel his presence. We observe each other, so the master doesnt observe us. Its only a matter of time before one turns the wrong way and his hateful eyes find you.

Hateful eyes are upon us. They sense weakness and bring it to the masters attention. The eyes of the hateful are everywhere. Theres no distinguishing them from us. Every eye is an enemy. Seeing so much pain should make them want to escape, but witnessing is addictive. It makes them comfortable with doom, because they get to witness, while not being the crux of masters wrath. They love to watch the world suffer, but when their time comes the eyes roll back. 

The eyes delight in all they see, but the soul is the only witness. Its the only aspect of this world that understands whats happening and knows enough to hide. It remains a witness, until the eyes roll back. When the eyes roll back, spiritual collapse follows. The Insufferable Demigod scoops out your eyes and shovels them into his mouth. He eats your eyes like grapes. If he likes the taste of your sin he tears you apart. If not, hell dig, until he finds something appetizing. If he finds the soul, the world collapses into a deeper nightmare, from which it will never wake. The soul must hide for 100,000 years or risk slipping into a darker reality.

Fear of the Demigod makes the eyes turn inward. 100,000 eyes shine a light of vapid introspection. The soul collapses into a fever dream, before it withers, but never dies. The Insufferable Demigod scratches the wall of eyes. They bleed and rot, until the corpuscles fuse together and strengthen the wall. The cycle continues. 

Thousands of eyes blink, but always miss when the soul is susceptible to their inspection. Theyll watch as long as it takes, for a chance to witness the souls darkest secret. 100,000 eyes witness nothing or everything. If they see everything, the soul unleashes cataclysm. Itll destroy everything to protect its secrets. 

Theres a chance the soul performs a desperate act of immolation. The sight of its sacrifice is abhorrent to the eyes. They turn in revulsion and reflect their fears unto the Insufferable One. The eyes grow wide. Greater than the appetite, they consume their master. If they see nothing, then the Insufferable Demigod digs deeper. If he finds the soul, it will sense his fear. This will give it enough strength to eat his heart and spit it into his throat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mind tried to wash the corpses out of the memory, because they were the evidence of my crimes. I think it tried to do that with murder weapons and other things, but some of my tools were so sacred that it wasn't allowed. Most of the details I struggle to remember, but when they come to me it's so exhilarating. 

Thank you for your kind words. I'm glad it spoke to you. If I do end up writing anything of significance I'd love to share it! </TEXT>

<TITLE> This is my Confession: The Thirteen Souls Waiting for me in Hell </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 19:45:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My name is Martin Aragon. I've posted a few times and will post a few more, because I find the anonymity and ability to 'tell-all' without the necessity to confirm my convictions fascinating. Everyone writes with conviction, but the veil of anonymity, as well as the opportunity for a 'suspended reality', allows for the existence of worlds that reality would never allow. An unsavvy reader could find himself lost in a tirade of dementia and narcissistic extremism, entertained by false assumptions of fairy tales and illusions, while he's sucked into a treacherous universe whose only utility is to torture and ensnare. It happens on a regular basis; we read into things, assuming the writer has our best interests at heart, when, in reality, the sincerity and devotion you expect, simply is not there.

Feel free to believe that all or none of this is true, but don't negate your desire to understand worlds and possibilities that you can never, ever know. People don't want the truth. That's why you'll follow me. You want a mystery. Is the man behind the screen really a murderer? It all seems so impossible... I mean... have I really made myself responsible for the souls of thirteen people? People you kill become your slaves in the afterlife, which is an unfortunate circumstance that I'm trying to rectify. I want to educate, but what wisdom could I share to make up for my sins? I understand my purpose, but not what to do about those I've harmed. I mean... what could be the reason that I had to kill? What was the purpose for the bloodshed and mayhem and despair? Is wisdom so important that people have to die in order for it to be understood?

These are questions I never intend to answer. I like to raise questions and let them go. They fester and form like bacteria, reaching out over a few and then everyone. That's not wisdom. Information is as much a virus as Ebola. People go wild with information, but mysteries are especially troublesome. The mind needs a mystery, like the body needs a sick virus to kill, so it can prepare our immune system. I recommend throwing a few good mysteries into your life, something to captivate, before you return to the banality of everyday life. If you learn to love disseminating small bits of information first, then the greater mysteries that infect us won't seem so terrifying. 

Life isn't about digesting and regurgitating, shoving clusters of ill-informed tid-bits down your throat and regurgitating nonsensical yammerings for which you feel no attachment. This is what feeds the fear. Stop. Examine. Chew, before you digest. Let your incisors sever every link to what you perceive, until it's broken down and used to fuel you to discover more mysteries. Above all, always keep entertained. If you're bored you'll die without a purpose and no one will remember your name.

My victims were my mystery. The entertainment was in knowing their desires, but not in some annotated sense of perceiving, studying... hunting. I learned so much more by talking, listening and, above all, maintaining eye-contact no matter how hard they fought. I felt an attachment to all of my victims. Their stories are significant to defining my struggle and humanity's 'quest for meaning' in an empty, unsupervised universe. Mine is the struggle of all great philosphers: to know. 

I know at this moment that there is no apologizing for murder. I won't be greeted at any 'pearly gates'. Most likely, if there is an afterlife, I'll find peace after thousands of years of torment. I'm going to hell. My victims will be there, because that's the intent. Their heaven consists of tearing my flesh, using my bones as instruments of further torment, making me eat my intestines in an infinite loop for eternity. 

The worst of these inevitable levels of hell is the one where they demand answers. There can be no apologies, but answers... I have none. How do you tell someone you killed that you did it to entertain yourself? How do you say that you put your faith in some 'greater force', because you knew you couldnt trust yourself? It's not an acceptable answer. They don't deserve that. Hopefully, I have plenty of time to work on my apology, while I fight the urge to create more slaves in the afterlife. 

Truth is all that matters, but truth is the easiest thing to manipulate, twist, skin, boil alive, in order to make it more appetizing. We think truth is ugly and for some reason the mental gymnastics that we play on it are all beautiful. Distortion of truth is disgusting. We manipulate so we can digest. I've been doing it for a long time, but before I get into that, I'd rather offer my confession:

Thirteen people I killed thirteen two men and eleven women. I liked the thought of that number remaining. There is every possibility that if I continue, the cosmic sequence will end and the universe will tumble into oblivion. I'll leave it there for now, until the divine hand guides me to a deeper understanding. The clock strikes twelve. If it ever hits thirteen... the cosmic dance comes to an end.

My first victim was a man I like to call 'Travis'. I apologize for not sharing his real name, but that belongs to me now. Travis was a homeless gentleman I met outside a restaurant one night. I took him to a diner. He had chicken soup with crackers, a glass of water, a side of bread and a slab of undercooked tilapia. I recommended the tilapia, as he wouldn't have ordered it otherwise. I could tell he was hungry, but he thought he would be nice and not order more than a bowl of soup. I asked Travis to tell me all about his life. He was a son, but never knew his father. His mother worked to raise him and his seven siblings, although four of them died before they could reach their teens. He hadn't seen his family for over twenty years, roughly the same amount of time he'd spent on the streets. There was kindness in his eyes with a humble gentleness and just a hint of sorrow. Pain shows itself in these unkempt blemishes, bright orbs of light that explode into the cloudiness of our pupils. If you look close enough, you can count a mans sins by studying his eyes.  

I killed Travis a few blocks from the diner. I examined the area a week before and found that a body could be disposed of easily behind a vacant lot three blocks down from the diner. Several abandoned buildings lined the streets. People avoided this part of town, so no one would bother looking, not that they'd care about an old homeless man. We walked towards the vacant lot, but I told him we were going to a hotel. I would buy him a room and let him sleep for the night in a comfortable bed. I brought him around the side of the old 'Matrix Agynsta Industrial Complex', which was occupied by a law firm, several condominiums and a dental office along a brighter timeline in American history. He saw the chain-link fence and turned, just as I charged, stabbing him in the stomach with a hunting knife. I made sure to twist the blade when I felt it hit an impasse near his stomach. The twist dislodged the blade, before cutting its way out. 

Travis looked so surprised. His eyes lit up with an explosion of thoughts that triggered so much emotion. If death hadnt come he wouldve gone insane. I stabbed him again. I put one hand on his shoulder and dug the blade into his stomach. I lost control from this point. Really, the memory is all sort of... cluttered. There was so much emotion. The rush of it... murder is the only drug. 

I cleaned his blood from my blade and put it back in its hiding place. The mess of his insides was framed by his tattered form. His body lay in a wreck alongside the back of the dumpster, where he would remain for several weeks, before someone finally found him. His eyes told a greater story than anything he'd told me. The sincerity of his lie is something that I will never forget. It was the truth or what he wanted to believe. 

I find a particular fascination in their eyes. Everyone has a story and they tell it better if you look into their eyes. Travis never let go. Despite the wave of terror rolling over him, Travis clung to a mystifying reality. His pupil held firmly in place, shuttering, blinking, but remaining centered. It was amazing to see it twitch. I expected it to tear apart and become awash in the ocean of white. 

He lied to me. 

I thought killing men in the prime of their lives would be enough of a challenge to entertain me, but it became systematic and boring. I found the idea of the hunt, taking down powerful men, like predators forced into battle by survival, honorable. The equation never added up and this quickly became a plan that sounded much better than it was in practice. Men present no challenge when they die. Women are fighters. I respect them much more as adversaries and hold for them the utmost respect. 

The death of a man holds less meaning than the death of a woman. It was much less fulfilling to see the light fade from Travis' eyes. A man holds onto a lie well into death, while a woman will compromise. She'll hold onto it, of course, but it'll mold her, as she makes her way closer to the inevitable. 

My second victim was a woman. It's because of her that I understood this principle and all I needed to know about the afterlife. It was the first time I killed a woman, but after that, their destruction and doom was the only thing that made sense. It wasn't that they had to suffer. They wanted to suffer, but also wanted an end to their pain. Death meant release. I have trouble discouraging the thought that these women needed me to set them free.

I remember the moment I knew that Calliope needed to die. She was young and beautiful and all the more perfect. It wasn't long after I found her that I became obsessed. I've always had a rape fantasy, since I was a teenager and not long into meeting her I fantasized about tearing off her clothes and abusing her in countless ways. She became an obsession to me. There has never been a need for me to fulfill these urges. It's not the same to me as murder. It's an abhorrent thing. Rapists deserve a rotting death, torment by scavengers that pick the flesh from their bones, while they scream in agony. 

Calliope was a runaway. I don't know who would ever abandon her. I took her in, provided food and shelter. Nobody knew about her. Her parents were across the country. She was such a sweet girl. I fantasized every night about her rape, but never her murder. It's harder for me to fantasize about killing, because I know it's possible. I can murder, but rape is beyond me, which is where I want it to stay. Complicated emotions tangled around her and the inevitable suffering I would cause her. She was sixteen when I found her. I couldn't make sense of these thoughts. Did I want to fuck her or set her free? I think my original plan was to save her, but that's probably a lie. I don't know, I really don't... or I don't want to accept the truth. My intent was always calculated... cold blooded. I knew that, no matter how I loved her... Calliope had to die.

My obsession with this beautiful young girl brought on a conflict between impulse and emotion. I wanted her to live. Setting her free was the right thing to do. She was beautiful, inside and out... this is how I justify her salvation. Such a warped ideology that I regurgitated, as I considered the notion of 'murder as salvation'. It seemed like a cruel joke. I made it about a week, before a nightmare brought about the inevitable conclusion. A dream made me kill her. I dreamt of slithering into her room, a snake in human form, sliding along the floor, creeping into her bed, moving between her legs and consuming her, before I woke up. 

How could I prevent that which appeared inevitable?

One day, Calliope appeared in the darkness. She crept into my room. I acted as if I was sleeping, as she snuck into my bed. I felt her warm, naked body pressing against me. She took my arm and put it over her. She moved her body along mine and I felt my body go hard. Everything tightened. I fought the urges inside me, as she kissed along my hand and up my arm. She pulled me closer, as I slid inside her. My hand wrapped around her throat, gently at first, before the impulse took over. I didn't want to fuck her. I needed her death on my hands. All she wanted was to love, to be loved, something so normal and human that it pains me still to consider. 

I could never be that person. Killing her brought me no catharsis. What I saw in her eyes... I'd rather not say. I buried her body in a field far removed from civilization. I decorated her in rose petals.

It took a while after that for the urge to return. I knew it hadn't died, but subtly slid beneath the surface of my shame. I could feel it hiding inside me, like a splinter sinking deeper into my flesh. When it returned, it was like nothing I'd ever felt. It returned in a wave of anger and I saw my next victim walk in front of me. He carried himself with such superiority, much too much grace in his steps, as if he was lifting off the ground. Sin is easy enough to see when you know how to look. Its your perception of the world that allows you to either acknowledge or ignore the truth. He thought he wasnt a man, but the supreme ruler of all the lands he surveyed. 

His death would have to be swift and brutal. The rage that overwhelmed me would have it no other way. For that, I had the axe. There's nothing to send more of a message than killing a man with an axe. A knife shows comfort with the human form. An axe is used if you want to destroy a man's name. The axe is a guarantee of blood spraying everywhere, mangled bits of flesh, torn organs shredded beyond repair and the disbelief of any solidarity in the essence of our human forms. 

I followed him to a bar, where he met a group of friends. He was drunk within an hour. He wore a Brutasche cloth, Armani suit with a blue Harvard tie, Elijah Rucco cufflinks and black, Italian leather shoes. His hair was slick, so were his eyes. His friends looked almost identical to him and I remember thinking that I could kill any one of them and it wouldn't matter. A few family members might care, but not me and not the world. 

Hours passed with no end in sight. I thought to give up and left the bar. After a few minutes, they stumbled out of the bar, yelling at the bouncer who blocked their return. They called a cab, but out of some instance of divine intervention, one of the friends turned on him out of some swelling sense of drunken rage. They stood a few feet away from the cab. The friend said something and the man reacted by punching him in the stomach. A few of the others climbed out of the cab and broke it up, but they all turned on him. They pushed him out of the way, cussing and yelling, as they took off in the taxi. He got up and yelled at the taxi, which drove down the street, before walking in the opposite direction.

The axe is... I don't want to say the 'funnest' way to kill a person, but... it provides such an atavistic rush to the proceedings... it desensitizes you. It's so brutal that it sends at least a thunderous jolt, punitive recoil of dark energy into all who use it. Nothing can compare to the rush of slamming cold steel down, splitting a man's skull in two and jamming your foot into his rib cage, so you can yank it out and do it again. 

I followed him a few blocks, before the perfect moment appeared before me. He stumbled right into a trap, falling over the side of the road and into oncoming traffic. A taxi nearly ran him down, but he stumbled instead over to the curb, where he sat. I came over, as any good samaritan, jogging over before anyone else could claim such a simple victory. I spoke loud enough that everyone around, not that there were many at such a late hour, knew I was there to help. I made the declaration clear that we were getting a cab and I was taking him home. I told him hed need to rest it off. We went to an apartment in an undesirable neighborhood. I tied him to a radiator and split his rib cage with the axe. The explosion on impact sprayed crimson in my eyes and I felt blessed, baptized by the blood of the depraved. It wasnt God, but the imminent, doomed, savage beasts, sons of the antichrist. My eyes couldnt adjust. I saw hell, demons within the pit of my soul chewing on veins, tugging strings to make my heart rancid so it could spew noxious fumes into the universe. I struck with the axe over and over. It takes its toll on your arms and shoulders. I was out of breath by the time I stopped and then, I had to, because there was nothing left of him. 

The bloody mess of a man, well, did he deserve my wrath? I have to ask, because its perspective that I desire more than anything. I felt Calliopes aftermath, something destructive pulsing inside of me that had to make its way out. This was fate. It was going to happen. This unlucky bastard was caught in the crossfire of my savage impulse and my rancid, overfed emotions.

Women are much better liars than men, because, as we all must learn, it isn't a lie if you believe what you say. Men are full of shit. Everyone knows it. It's gotten to the point where everyone just assumes that everything anyone says is a downright lie, which, basically, I guess it is. Nobody is concerned about truth. Killing people won't help, but if I can be truthful here... who knows. Men have this instant tell in their eyes when they lie. The clouds can't hold together and the pupil withers, fading into that fathomless ocean of white, like a drop of rain. There's something in that release, as a man realizes he's lost to a simple push of metal into his flesh. I twist the blade and he winces, his right eye shutters and the left becomes much more pronounced with an incalculable clarity. 

Men make you wonder what they see when they die, because, in all their horror, they don't really know. When women die, it's almost as if they're saying goodbye. Women never lie. They assume a truth that's reasonable and go with it. I've found it much easier to murder women. I've always found it easier to talk to women. I adore women, but not in some mean-spirited, warped idolatry. One who would refuse to examine the elements of their rhetoric for a while would think that women only want to talk about themselves. The truth of the matter is that women want to examine their own sources. They want to relax and accept their truths. If you approach a woman on a difficult subject, something she doesn't want to talk about, something personal or just anything that might detract from her standing with a certain crowd, she won't lie, but she won't deny her own reality. She'll fight to protect it and allow her beliefs to coincide with parallel realities.

Women play the strongest game of mental gymnastics. When they die, it's like they're being set free and all the weight of their sin carries over into a forgiving, appreciative afterlife. I love setting them free. Women's eyes shine brighter when they die. They know so much. The deepest wisdom of their fragile spirits escapes for mere fractions of a second, before collapsing, folding and then disappearing forever. It takes no time at all for them to accept fate. Their pupils push back against the sea of white, like the petals of a rose unfolding to reveal something so beautiful and pure you pray to God you can touch it. In less than a moment, the petals wither and that which once mesmerized is destined to crumble. Somewhere in her eyes the truth is buried. I see it with every victim. I think that's why I hope to continue, because I'm convinced there's a deeper truth and understanding in her eyes. 

I found that using the axe to murder was like using a tactical nuclear device to get rid of an infestation of ants. It was so much overkill that I had to rest for hours and then days. The rush of dark energy flowing through my body was like some cancerous parasite coursing through my veins. It took some time to be rid of the parasite, but after, I felt numb and useless. I felt like a husk, a shell of a man, until I saw her. 

Rosanna was a beautiful young girl, blonde hair, 54, just over one-hundred pounds, but the weight went to all the right places. The symmetry of her face was calculated and hypnotic. I pictured Cleopatra when I looked into her eyes. She was young, cunning and ambitious. She looked in my direction, as another predator, but we were hunting different things. She made the mistake of making the first move, before knowing my convictions. I had to be careful not to do the same. 

Murder is meant to be done with a knife. Preference must become a factor, I understand, but because of who I am as a person, I repeat: Murder is meant to be done with a knife. A gun is so impersonal. Greedy governments use guns. A knife is pure. Poets kill with a knife. A knife is a blessing. I like to imagine that a shaman or priest has blessed it with the ability to send everyone I kill straight to heaven. No matter the truth, I love the effect it has on the people I set free. Their immediate sense is horror, but once its inside they get the point. It all makes sense and then means absolutely nothing. 

Rosanna was a different kind of victim than Calliope. She showed such strength on the outside, but inside inside she showed such affection, remorse and overwhelming humanity. She lived alone in a shitty apartment that she kept together nicely. Everything was a project for her. She enjoyed the muck of her life. It left her room for improvement. Projects were all she needed. Rosanna liked to be kept busy. We fucked in her bedroom, recently painted bright purple and a broken door that wouldnt close. It took a few weeks before I could kill her. The sex was too much for me to get away. I enjoy sex, masturbation and fantasy, but her attraction her pull that warped, incessant desire was difficult for me to ignore. She had a demon inside her that fed on every forced penetration. Every moment that her body shuddered I felt its presence. Every time I saw her orgasm it was the demon unfolding so that it might escape. 

It was out of terror that I killed her. It wasnt on purpose. I saw the demon, as we climaxed together. My hands wrapped around her throat. She wrapped her hands around my face, grabbing my cheeks and pressing her nails into the delicate tissue. She cut a jagged line across my face, but thought we were still having sex. Rosanna moved her hips more, as her hands went to my throat. My hands remained on hers as well, as my penis remained hard as a rock. We made love again, as I tried to kill her. When she finally felt the crushing touch of my fingers, as they pressed harder and harder, siphoning that last bit of air before the panic became too real, it was too late. 

Women are life. Men are death. A female praying mantis will eat her mate after sex. Blame survival. A man will eat his young. A woman has a sense of what it is to be alive. Her young are her trophies. Theyre a victory for surviving. It's only natural that a mother would want the world to see her trophies, as they carry her sin into the future. Our perception of the female of this species is whats leading to our extinction. Theyve somehow become the archetype for grace, civility and beauty, when theyre so much more. Women are the survivors and judicators. They determine if our species will further itself into the distant future or wither into an abominable nothing. 

Killing women meant the death of this species. 

I work for a law firm as what is known as an Examinating Representative Consultant. I dont even know what that means. Basically, my company helps greasy old billionaires remain obnoxious rich, as desperate, under-represented businesses try to fight back. I despise these old monsters. Theyll be the death of this species. Grimy old businessmen will be the extinction of the human race. I can see it in their eyes. Theyre cold not calculating its just the direction of their thoughts. They only think in greed. I remember one time we had to deliver the news to one of these old misers that his workers in one South American country went on strike. The look of relief on his face is something Ill never forget. He made it clear that his company would be moving on without them and to make it clear to these former workers that their services were no longer needed. It was basically an army that he sent to deliver the message. Five people died, two women. Governments and degenerate businessmen use guns so impersonal. 

Now, the problem with telling the rest of my story is that a huge gap exists in my memory of five through ten. I get confused, because they all looked the same. They acted and sounded the same. Their thoughts and emotions, even their eyes I felt like I was killing the same person over and over.

One of them was a dog groomer. She spoke for hours about dogs. She loved them. When I made a joke about her fucking dogs because she loved them so much, she went on about her perception of love. It threw me off that she didnt get offended. She stopped and laughed. Good joke. We went from dinner to her place. She had paintings of dogs on her walls, but didnt keep pets. She thought people shouldnt keep animals as pets. She believed that life was sacred. 

She knew right away that I was no good. She thought she could help me. She was a beautiful angel girl. I killed her five times. The other four Ill have to know better in the afterlife. My hands scorched with the fires of hell when I touched her that last time. I wrapped my hands around her throat and felt the fire pulling me into her. She was a messenger of God, a gypsy spirit sent to claim my soul. The devil had plans for me in the afterlife. Fear and flames overwhelmed me. She was dead by the time I woke up. There wasnt enough to be said about her. She was a loving, nurturing woman. I hope theres a better place for such a girl. She belongs beyond this world, where old, degenerate scumbags make the rules because of a few billion dollars. 

The other four I have yet to piece together. Ive tried to remember, but its like a blockage in my mind. I reach this barrier and cannot move forward. I took a moment to consider that the dementia was seeping further into my mind and that maybe it was time I sought professional assistance. Instead, I went to Calliope. I drove several hours to where Id buried her, a place outside the city, where shed be safe. The problem was that Calliope disappeared. There were no signs of any grave ever being in this place. I searched for hours thinking Id made a mistake and her body was somewhere else, only to be left wanting. 

Michelle. Twenty-two. Pharmacist. Light-brown roots showing through blonde-colored hair. Smile that could light up a room. The knife did her in, but my hands were definitely around her throat. I could hear a saxophone playing somewhere in the room. Was it a room or some indeterminable dimension in hell, for which well never escape? Ill kill her over and over again, without remorse, without a hope for improvement. She sang something so sweet in her dying breath. It sounded like a plea for mercy, but came out as a rallying cry. The world could understand her. It listened. She cried for them to hear, as the light faded from her eyes. 

The words were so powerful that I listened. I abandoned her in her apartment and ran home. Realizing that Id left so much evidence of my crimes, I went back. There were no signs of anything. The apartment was run-down, walls sinking with cracked paint, ceiling collapsing with rain damage, busted boards with sharp nails ready to snag loose flesh from your legs. I stepped back from that apartment and never returned. 

That's part of my confession you see... Im in need of assistance. I cant explain the extent of my sin, because there are no more boundaries. Ive committed the ultimate sin somewhere along the lines. Ive desecrated too many of Gods creatures to ever go back to that brilliant light of purity and justice. I noticed a man's sin the other day just by looking in his eyes. Your eyes are just... perfect vessels of wisdom and truth. If you haven't ever looked into your own eyes in a mirror you're ignoring a deeper understanding of the self. Look into your eyes and think about the worst thing you've ever done. Wait until you see those dark clouds in your pupils. Theyll recede to allow you to see the truth in your soul. 

I love seeing the truth in mine. I'm a homicidal maniac. I love murder and fantasize about rape. It's funny I never knew I was a 'bad guy', until I killed Travis. I used to fantasize about rape and lie about who I am as a person. Then, I never thought I'd commit murder. Then... I guess I never thought I'd lose control and live my life as a machine, committing violent, calculated attacks over and over again. 

I know the truth. I know what's right. I choose to do otherwise. I guess I've always known that I was evil, although I never knew I was a killer. It started with the rape fantasy. I've fantasized about it since I was a teenager. I know why. I love control. I love the forced removal of clothing, so I can break you down, until you're nearly exposed. I get to see you at your most vulnerable. I make you stand in front of me in your bra and panties and let my hands slide all over your body. I let you see the knife, so I can see the truth in your eyes. The soul reveals itself through the revelation of your darkest fears. I assume the role of abominable nightmare, until the sight is so overwhelming your senses collapse and everything goes numb. 

I remember the first time I went numb. I made the mistake of watching the "news". Society is full of 'important' people and the 'oh so gosh golly holier than thou' are the ones that watch the news. I think the technology came on faster than we knew. We weren't ready to deal with it. In a few decades, we'll either have a handle on it or it will have come to consume our corpse. My mind wasn't ready for it. There's so much going on around the world and there's nothing you can do about it. I think at the time the U.S. had undergone a military operation in Somalia. The Somalis killed a man with a machete on live television, but all we saw was the assailants arm rising with the weapon, before the camera pulled away. I remember thinking 'where did they go?' I couldn't answer. I cried so hard. I tried to calm down, but I couldn't. I wanted a peaceful, orderly universe and the news disrupted my worldview with a cacophony of jarbled, incongruous messages, spliced with PG-13 violence and commercials for Coca-Cola.

Brenda a prototype of the New Free-Love Generation. She was a drifting hippie, whose caravan of seekers found themselves abandoned off the side of the interstate. Wait Brenda was in the trunk no Celia was in the trunk. She was either number eight or it must be seven. I dragged Celia behind a nightclub downtown. The knife went into her flesh with such ease. She spit blood in my face. The fires of hell consumed me. I stabbed her over and over, before the fires settled and I stopped seeing red. She whimpered, as she dragged her bleeding frame along the filthy alley. 

I took her body on a roadtrip, thinking I would find some peace in burying another of my victims in the countryside. I shouldve stopped, when I realized this is where I belong. Brenda needed a ride. Unfortunately, two of her friends snuck into the back seats of my car. I think the thought was to kill Brenda, because I thought it would be fitting. She reminded me a lot of Calliope. They couldve shared some spirit, a vital essence that sprung forth from the heavens to bring purity and joy into the world. Why did I feel the need to stifle such a positive energy? 

Parasiticus Ominus. Its this parasite that goes from host to host spreading all the most vile and depraved of emotions. Its responsible for the Holocaust, Hiroshima, genocides, plagues, famines, mass corporate greed, racism all that good stuff. There are good parasites and bad ones that science just now understands. In the future, therell be beacons, like there are for radio waves. These ones will propagate good bacteria, while stifling the bad. For now, you have to trust your instincts. They flow from your gut, which is riddled with bacteria. 

No wait I killed Brenda and her two friends. The hammer. One of her friends in the backseat found a hammer. She thought nothing of it. Hammer of the Gods. The hammer hadnt been used for anything insidious, but when she handed it to me I smashed it into Brendas face. It struck right in her teeth. Everyone screamed in shock and terror, including Brenda. Her cries echoed through her shattered teeth. I drove faster, slamming my foot against the pedal, before crashing into a ditch. Her two friends flew through the windshield. Brenda survived, but didnt make it far. She crawled along the warm pavement, leaving a trail of blood to the scene of the crime. I climbed over her. One swing of the hammer and I felt the recoil, as it cracked her skull. Her face smashed against the concrete, already broken from the previous strike in the car, as her body convulsed. The sight of her convulsions terrified me. I wanted nothing more than to end it. I slammed the hammer over and over, until she stopped. 

The hammer is a weapon I would highly recommend, if only for its efficiency. You can carry it anywhere and use it as much as you please without impossible strength or stamina. An axe is much more work. You have to drag it over your head to provide enough force to break through the flesh and body, and then pull it out to do it all over. A hammer beats its target, breaks it down, shatters, and pulverizes. The hammer remains the same, while the victim becomes unrecognizable. 

There was a time when Id look for a victim, but the hunt is so much more enduring. Its in our myths, although its so much more. Hunting is written in our D.N.A. Parasiticus Ominus fights for survival. He looks for the right victim. He measures, moderates, adjusts and hunts some more, so that he will find the victim whos perfect for his cause. What does he seek? How does he know when he finds it? These are the answers that elude me. Thats why I refuse to ask more questions. Its not worth knowing, unless I know completely. 

Nothing can compare to that perfect feeling of murder. The rush is a high that no drug will ever match. Its a religious experience. Murder doesnt come to us naturally at least I have trouble believing it does. We kill for survival. We kill baby pigs and chickens and cows, because they cant fight for themselves. If you cant defend yourself, a natural instinct kicks into the predator. You become his slave. This is the afterlife. My victims are chickens and pigs thrown into cages for the rest of their lives. Imagine how that baby pig sees his master? Im a walking nightmare. I approach their cages and feed them, not to sustain them, but to fatten them up, so theyll make me more money. Greed. Angel of Remorse, hear my demands for a return. 

My eleventh victim was a prostitute. I never paid for sex before, but it seemed like the easiest way to find my victim. Prostitutes are already victims. Pimps own them. Slavery is all around us in this country. The filth and greed of it. I set her free. We went around the corner to a dead-end. Decades of disrepair left the street full of vacant buildings. The world collapsed around me, decades of greed and corruption. America enters this final age. I brought a rope that she thought meant I wanted something kinky. Bondage. While it is a turn on, this was not my intention. My life is far too complicated for anything more, especially sexually. Im afraid Ill open a Pandoras Box, from which Ill never escape. The rope left red marks over her white flesh. I left her in a dumpster. 

Parasiticus Ominus possessed a rampant infection within himself. Our spirits became as one, not only when he committed such heinous atrocities, but also when he felt strong emotions for which he needed help understanding. He was a lot like me. I think he loved his victims. I think he loved the prostitute, because she was a part of him. His brothers, other strains of Parasiticus Ominus, were inside her. They fed her the fear and made her life a nightmare, before she came full circle. Parasiticus Ominus. She found the end of her road at its beginning. 

Bacteria deranged parasites with love in their heart flies that chew through the flesh of children in Africa they share warmth and desires like the rest of us. Were all chewing our way through this pile of shit we call life. Do you know what is Parasiticus Ominus deepest, darkest desire? He wants the ocean to be nothing more than a tub full of acid. If and when that happens Parasiticus will consume his brothers. He will ingest more and more, until hes grown to such volume that he explodes from his cocoon and becomes the dreaded beast of apocalyptic lore. The myths and predilections of our ancestors were nothing more than fever dreams brought on by Parasiticus Ominus. Religion is a lie. Faith is meant to make him. 

I had a tub of acid in an apartment in a less than desirable neighborhood. I used it to carve up bodies from time to time, but for the most part I buried my victims in tact. Its when I thought people would take extra care in finding them that I used such precautions. 

Deborah wouldve been my last victim, if not for her bitchy, overly determined sister, Diana. They were both beautiful, but Deborah was the easiest to fool with simple sincerity. Most women fall for sincerity. It feeds into the lies they tell themselves. Deborah saw the best in me. Diana saw the worst. They were both right. I killed Deborah with a knife. We were at my apartment. I stabbed her over and over and not a moment later Diana knocked at my door. I dragged Deborah into a closet. Diana demanded to see her sister, but I told her I hadnt seen Deborah in a few days. She knew that was an immediate lie. It was the last time I used the hammer. I swung it and missed. Diana made a break for the door. I chased her out of the apartment and grabbed the back of her jacket. She fought me. I panicked and pushed her over the balcony. She fell several stories and cracked her neck. 

There was no escape. Someone must have heard. I shut the door and hid, but realized Deborah was still rotting in the closet. I heard a knocking at the closet door and the knob turned. Deborah could barely reach it, but tried to twist with her bloodied fingers. I left her and ran to gather up the broken mess of her sister. I looked over the balcony with the several supplies Id gathered to clean the mess, but she was gone. 

Nothing remained of the occurrence. There were no signs of her or anyone for that matter. Something happened. I had neighbors, but none of them would answer their doors. I went screaming down the halls, but there was no one there. 

I ran down the stairs and out into the streets, where I saw the name of the building written in stone, 'Matrix Agynsta Industrial Complex'. Windows were boarded up. Dust collected over the pile of concrete that stood before me. I was alone in the universe. This was hell. Id been convicted by a tribunal, not of peers, but gods who walk among us. They identified the strain, Parasiticus Ominus, and decided to detach it, dislodge it from the defiled corpse of the human race. 

This is where I belong. Im at peace. Whether you believe this confession I really dont care. Ive said all I had to say. Ive confessed to the most abhorrent compunction of my soul. This is my truth take it or leave it. </TEXT>

Nobody can measure the power of faith, because those who could won't. Everyone who has it has described it to me the same as anyone who talks about their anger. It's this bubbling mass of hot air that has to escape you. It has to express itself through unwitting devotion and blind necessity. Faith is an ugly, vulgar trickster. Calliope understood her destiny, because it's what Grzuul told her. She was an important piece, but a piece all its own. She could make her own choices, but needed to make this one. What she chose to do is lie to several doctors, trick them into believing she was better and sacrifice her life.

In a matter of months, Calliope made remarkable improvements in her health, as well as her communication skills. She became much calmer once they found the proper medications, but still maintained that aloof caricature of herself. The doctors could find no reason to keep her. There had been no incidents to cause concern over the past few months, so everyone (including me) believed she was ready. My one cause for concern revolved around the fact that Id known her as this unpredictable whim of nature for so long. Wed neglected to find her the proper care when it couldve done more for her and now that was over. Shed gotten the proper care and, after years of neglect, her departure, to me, seemed abrupt. 

I tried to point out that shed been this aloof person for as long as I knew her. The doctors didn't seem concerned. When I asked if she might be faking or toning down her psychosis, I insulted her psychiatrist and received a few long-winded diagnosis' that were meant to 'put me in my place'. The joke was on them, because I hardly understood any of what they said!

Studying her condition (or what science had to say about it) since she'd been found, did little to put me at ease. I understood more than before, but it didnt explain her. I'd studied her for much longer than her disease, as if they werent mutually exclusive. She couldnt be anything but Calliope in my mind. I believed that Calliope was infatuated with her mind's ability to respond to her... and, most of the time, only to her. She wasnt talking to the world. Calliope saw and spoke through the voices. They acted as a barrier between her and the rest of the world.

(I regret making this assumption. It wasnt my place. I shouldve listened and accepted whatever the doctors told me, but I was stubborn. I had mismanaged our friendship and needed any reason I could to protect her.)

Before they let her out of that place, I tried to convince her to stay. I said, "Calliope... are you sure you're ready to leave?"

She replied. "I am. I miss you all. It's been too long. I need you all around me."

"Calliope... is there anything you're not telling me?"

"I tell you everything, because I love you."

"I love you too, Calliope."

She'd never said she loved me. I always assumed, but hearing those words did everything to lull me into a fanciful illusion of us settling down with two kids and a nice house with a long, white picket fence. My guard was up, so I assumed the voices told her to say it. The truth, which I had to admit right away, was that Calliope never had to say, I love you. Everyone knew her love. She went around to different rooms around the psychiatric center and would ask patients how they were and hug them after. She smiled and waved like a princess greeting her devoted followers, before returning to her room with a complicated smile. 

The center supervised all of its patients around the clock. I requested a review of the security videos from her room. They allowed my request, so I occupied one of their rooms for several hours and made it my mission to figure out what was happening in her mind. 

There was a pattern. Her first few days, she sat by the window. She'd stay up all night and pass out in a chair. She'd wake up when the light came up and go to bed. What happened from there, well, I can't explain. She'd rest nicely with her eyes closed and to all who saw you'd assume she slept like an angel. She'd wait every morning for the doctors to come in before she could get up. After several nights of waiting by the window, she stopped and found something else to occupy her time. She wasn't allowed pens, but she had plenty of crayons. She went between black and purple, writing and drawing in a composition notebook. She'd work all night, falling asleep before the sun came up and waking with the return of the medical staff. 

I showed them the footage and demanded to see what she'd written. The medical staff agreed, but when they approached Calliope she hesitated. I couldn't believe the voices would do this to her. I suddenly had the notion that they'd led her into a trap... I mean... she had to understand that the physicians would want to know what was going through her mind and would do all that they could, including reading her diaries. She gave it up without a fight. She looked so sullen and defeated, as she handed it over to the chief medical consultant. 

The doctors didn't know what to make of her drawings. At first glance, they were nonsensical jargon from a paranoid, delusional, schizophrenic mind. Upon further inspection, which took about an hour of sifting through one-hundred and seven pages, we realized that Calliope had written out every last detail of how she thought she would die. 

I

Calliope wouldn't explain to anyone what she had drawn. It became clear to her that she wouldn't be leaving, so she shut down and cried. She cried on my shoulder for about an hour, before asking when she could expect to be released. I'll never forget her transformation. She turned up from her faithless whimpering and immediately elevated her joyful, infectious beauty, as she asked, "When can we all be a family again?" I told her it's going to take a little more time. She didn't like that answer, but she understood. She seemed to calm down, but her eyes were busy as usual. 

I asked her to explain the drawings. She spoke with such joy for what she'd done. She knew exactly how she was supposed to die, but wouldn't tell me why. When I asked why she couldn't tell me, she said she wasn't allowed to. In my mind, that means she didn't want to tell me, because she thought it put us in danger. 

The third page was the diagram of her death. It showed a female form, not unlike Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. In the top-right of the third page was a separate diagram of something that looked like a jagged rock. A black line connected the rock to the diagram of the body, where a gaping wound was drawn in red. I asked her about that. She said that she would die by the hands of some sacred tool. I asked why it was sacred. She said that it was sacred, because it would create a paradox that would 'open the first gateway'.

She wouldn't explain what that meant and continued along with her story, until I demanded to know. The look in her eyes, always busy, returned and I saw the shudder of dozens of voices screaming inside her. They told her which road to take, how to evade my questioning, how to give up, how to run, how to escape. I felt bad for waking them, as she stood over her drawings and cried. I apologized and she let me hug her. 

"You're one of the only ones that the voices listen to," she said.

"Who else would they listen to?" I asked. 

"Grzuul," she admitted. "But he was full of promises."

II

I wasn't the one that caused her pain. She and the voices understood that, but where we all differed was in finding that delicate middle ground, where we work to make everything better. Nobody knew, especially Calliope, why she had to suffer. Her mind was a curse. It was crippled as much as anyone in a wheelchair. The voices thought they could help Calliope and also, well, I believe her in that they mightve wanted her help as well. Instead, they only caused each other greater harm. It was a parasitic entanglement. I wanted the doctors to care for her, maybe for the rest of her life, but really, the thought of her being imprisoned in such a place for the rest of her days, away from us, her family, was too much for me to bear. 

I asked her about the stone. She told me it was a sacred relic that belonged to her. She said it was piece of bone, but not hers. It belonged to a version of her that I knew much better, because it was a chunk of ribs from when she was a child. She claimed that in another world Grzuul killed her and took her rib. He found her in this reality and killed her with the rib of her ten-year-old-self. When I asked why he would need to do such a thing, she replied,

"Because it's the only way to kill me."

I fought for her to stay, because I thought it would be in her best interest. It wasnt my intention for her to be there forever, but as long as the doctors thought she would need. The doctors understood after they saw her drawings, but her parents took a lot of convincing. All they wanted was their daughter back, but I assured them that we had to be patient. We made a vow to care for her, because we hadn't when she was ten. We lost her then, but I wouldnt lose her again. 

It took several hours to convince them. We stayed at the facility all day. I think everyone was pretty annoyed with me, but I wouldn't budge. Calliope had to stay. The people in charge of the facility agreed, which helped Calliope's parents. They agreed. They trusted that I wanted only the best for her, but still made me be the one to tell her.

Calliope took the news and appeared disappointed, though she shrugged off her dismay in a matter of seconds. She went right back to her drawings and slipped deeper into her abysmal silence. We expected something along the lines of hysterics, but the calm in her eyes appeared permanent. She was such a good actress. It terrified the hell out of me. 

III

The next day, Calliope was missing. Her parents, having finally found her after all these years and now having her torn away from them, acted as one would expect. Her father assaulted the head physician, while Calliope's mother collapsed. She was conscious when they got to her, but she wouldn't move. She begged them to leave her alone, but the doctors picked her up and dragged her body over to a couch. 

The police reviewed the security cameras, but a clip between 3:35A.M. and 3:57A.M. had been cut clean. No one would admit to tampering and the police assumed that the facility was hiding something. They thought that Calliope had been disappeared for some reason. There was no build up to anything significant. Calliope slept through the night. She was much more peaceful than ever before. The doctors had no reason to want her gone. By all accounts, Calliope was a model patient who made it her duty to cheer up everyone in the facility. 

Between 3AM and 3:30, the security camera shows her moving around. She doesn't reveal herself to be awake. Instead, she rests and waits, hides from us, until 3:32AM. She moves up in her bed. It appears as if she's moving around for a moment, before settling in place. She couldn't hide her excitement, for what she saw. The camera didn't have a clear line of vision, so I couldn't tell what she was seeing. Her bed looked out a window, which stood five stories up from an emergency wing of a medical institution. She's looking for something, lying in desperate wait, as that thing for which she remains so patient appears and then everything gets scrambled. 

It took whoever it was twenty-two minutes to have her out of there. No other cameras caught their escape. For some reason, their service 'kicked out' and went black between those times. 

We had no clues. We lost her again. Calliope disappeared without a trace. Her parents had this hollow look in their eyes, as if their spirits faded into the backdrop of a dire emptiness inside them, retreating from the pain, devolving into a sensible 'automaton' state. Calliope left a single clue: her drawings. Everyone else assumed they were ramblings of a schizophrenic, but I thought I could make sense of them. I was one of the few people that 'the voices listened to', so maybe, in a way, they might be trying to get a message through her to me. 

Calliope wrote down every thought. I think she did it to be purposely misleading. Not everyone was meant to see this journal. At first, I thought she wrote it to get all of her thoughts in order, but as I read through some of her notes I assumed it was all for me. It wouldve made sense for her to write this journal to achieve a sense of control over her fate, if, as we thought, she was the one writing it. We forgot to consider the voices. They were trying to get a message to anyone that would listen. That happened to be me. 

They had her draw out a building, a seven-story tower with a bell that rang a few times a day. She drew out the bell and wrote, 'Bell of San Pietro'. Under the name, she wrote 'Transfiguration' and then below that 'Transmogrification'. 

It was the only building in the journal, so I looked it up to find others and found one within twenty miles of the facility, 'The Bell Tower of Saint Peter'. I called the police and told them to meet me there. I didn't give them time to tell me not to go. I wouldn't have listened. A trail of blue petals led along a dirt walkway to the tower. The door was open. I heard the police cars pulling up, as I ran into the building.

I found Calliope on the third floor with a hole in her chest. Whatever 'sacred tool' they used was strong enough to cut right through the rib cage and stab her in the heart. Blue petals were all around her. The police pulled up behind me, as I noticed a man stepping out of a dark corner. He held the sacred weapon in his right hand. The police shouted for him to drop it and put his hands behind his head. He followed their commands, but his eyes were on me. He had a design carved into his forehead that reminded me of a star. It was a cross with two lines intersecting at the center to form a sinister scar. 

His eyes followed me everywhere, as he managed his own mind, trying to find the right words. "Nobody wanted this," he said. "But, this is the way it has to be." I felt the weight of my soul drifting from my body. I felt myself sinking. "The Promiser would've come for her... we had to erase her... he'll never get her... he'll never touch her again." The smile on his face made worms squirm at my center and chew on my insides. The police took him away. Calliope looked so pristine, so peaceful. I like to think that he brought her a tranquility that she was never meant to feel in this life. It's a nice thought to block the terror I feel for decades of regret. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I first met Calliope, I thought she was an angel. It took no effort for her to be happy and she smiled all the same, whether the day brought sadness or a hope of newfound joy. She never needed an assurance that things would get better. Things were fine, no matter what they were, to her. Her happiness came from a natural, freak phenomenon in her mind that made her bright and bubbly and, more importantly, permanently overwhelmed by her sense of wonderment. 

Our friendship began, when I heard her passing by my house. She made a great deal of noise wherever she went. She was talking to herself (or so I thought), when she passed my window. She turned back and saw me. I tried to hide and she came to my door. She demanded that I join her on her walk to the park. She promised that shed pay more attention to me than her other friends. In all honesty, I was a ten year old boy who was terrified of everyone, including girls, so I did my best to refuse. When it became abundantly clear she wouldnt leave me alone, I agreed to her terms. 

These friends, so I learned, were all in her head. I would be the one friend that was real (so I assumed). We went to the park and she would go from topic to topic on her own. I thought she was listening to my opinions, which she did, but there were others who I couldnt hear discussing the same stories. She would wait for their approval and then go to me, as I was the outsider. When I would say something, her eyes would turn upward. Shed nod along, hearing conflicting reports in her mind, before acknowledging me. 

I think she preferred my opinion to some of the voices, because she came around more often after that day. Shed invite me into some of her discussions and I noticed more of her attention drifting to me. I wonder still if the voices hated me, if maybe I was taking her away from them and, maybe thats why they allowed her to be led into danger. She never spoke of the voices, but I knew they were there. It was in her eyes, her facial twitch, which made her cheeks go rosy and soft against her face, as her beautiful blue eyes rolled as far back into her skull as they could. I could see the irises rolling at the top of her eyelids, bouncing and pulsing, as she listened to the arguments in her mind. She always seemed to have control. I do, however, remember a few days in school where Calliope would throw a tantrum and be sent to the principal. She hated sitting down for too long and on long days shed get bored listening to the teacher and would rather sit on the windowsill, no matter the weather. 

A crick ran down the side of our school. Children played by the crick all the time, but during our recesses at school, they made it a point to avoid the crick. Calliope never listened. She claimed she had to. It was such a fun show of civil disobedience that all the children joined her. She was so happy. I couldnt understand why. I think it was because all of the voices had told her to do it and now, having done it and been validated by an entire school, it was as if everyone was in agreement.

I

On the night she disappeared, she came to my window and asked me to go with her. I was ten years old at the time, listening to the radio, when I heard her knocking on my window. She asked me to go on an adventure. I told her it was too late and my parents wouldnt let me. She told me I needed to be a part of this adventure. She said all of her friends wanted me to join her and claimed I was too important not to go. I still refused and have held onto the regret of it for my entire life. 

Her words made me uneasy, because I knew the only friends she had were the voices and me. I asked her who would be waiting for us, but she refused to answer. I felt uneasy about it, yet I had no way of convincing her that she shouldnt go on this one adventure. Ive never told anyone the truth about that night. 

The next day, everyone was looking for her. Everyone banded together in search parties and went out into the woods, but they would never find her. My parents asked me about her and I told them I didnt know. I told them I hadnt seen her since the end of the school day.

Calliope had several friends in her head. I thought nothing of it, because we were both young and it was fun to make things up. Shed make something up and Id do my best to match her insanity. I never had a chance. Her mind operated on levels of perception that, even as an adult, Ill never comprehend. Its easier to assume that her mind had some faulty wiring and thats what made her hear voices. I dont buy that, because I knew her. She was smart, but she wouldnt perform in anything she perceived as infringing on her ability to live freely. Her body was always ready to move, dance and play and be removed from this world. 

There was never a need to add to her insanity. She did a good enough job of that all by herself. If I interrupted her train of thought it would ruin her moods. Calliope didnt get mad, but she did go quiet. Being quiet was a punishment from the voices. Theyd stop talking and make her do the same. I hated when she went quiet and I never figured out how to keep her from doing it. After a while, once she deemed it a suitable time, shed come back with the same story or discussion. One thing she would say was that there were voices deeper inside her. She claimed these were the voices of monsters. On the surface of her mind, she spoke to angels, but deep down, she only spoke with the angels, so that the monsters wouldnt try to reach her. 

II

Calliope chose to ignore the monsters and I guess so did the rest of us. Her parents wanted them out of her, but three psychologists couldnt do the trick. Calliope went to three different psychiatrists, each offering their expertise at the time, which amounted to prescriptions and several sessions a week. It all became costly to the family, but they only wanted the best for her. The medications did nothing to slow her mind and the same incessant ranting continued. It seemed that nothing could stop the voices. I dont like to think in such a way, but well could they have gone into some defensive mode or maybe thought up a way to take her hostage?

I know there has to be someone out there whose mind has taken them hostage.

Calliope fought back against her parents insistence that she get help. I wish I hadnt been around, but I think she sabotaged me. She told me to come over and after a few hours of playing in her room, we went down in her living room and she told them she no longer wanted to go to therapy. She told her parents that what she was seeing is real and she knew the future and that she had to do things to save us all. She held my hand so tight and looked into my eyes. She wanted me to hold on too, but I was too young to understand the significance. I didnt want to hold on. I wanted her to get better. I thought that maybe the adults and doctors were right and that they could help her, if she was sick. One of the greatest problems for someone whos sick is that they have a trouble acknowledging that something is wrong. 

She spoke to several voices that wanted her to continue with the therapy, except for one. His name was Grzuul and he only spoke to children. She didnt like Grzuul, because he lied to her upon their first meeting and claimed to be an angel. When she called him out on the obvious lie, he respected her for it and kept his distance. It got to a point where she was seeing him more than her therapist. Shed find me after their meetings or before and tell me all about him. She claimed he was a wizard who lived in a box outside of town. When I asked what kind of box? she claimed it to be an empty television box that read 40 Razor Addition. She said hed pop out of the box with a handful of flowers. She said hed take her for walks along the crick and promised that when the preparations were complete hed show her the truth about her destiny. 

What is destiny? Back then, I had no idea. Even as an adult, I cant think like, what is destiny? They never found her body. What was her destiny?

One day, Calliopes parents came to my door. My mother let them in after they asked to talk about their daughter. They were always talking about her and never in a flattering way. I think that, for the most part, they loved her, but her abilities were too confusing for anyone to understand. They didnt know how to care for her. They didnt want her to have to deal with therapy or medication her entire life, which brought them to my home. It seemed that they noticed a few bruises going up her legs and one well-pronounced purple bruise on her skin beneath her right shoulder. They asked my parents if I had done it and my parents even brought me down to ask. I told them no and I hadnt touched her. I would never do such a thing. I didnt have many friends, but she was one of my favorite people at the time. I never wouldve done anything to hurt her. 

After that, I told them about her friend Grzuul, which they already knew about. They thought he was imaginary too, but now they didnt know what to make of the story. They assumed their daughter was entering some dangerous psychological experience, for which they couldnt help and thought about having her committed. I told them they couldnt do that, because I believed with all my heart that would kill her. Although, I still stand by that position, I understand it. They were out of ideas and we all wanted the best for her, although none of us were willing to do what it took to actually help. 

It was difficult at the time to understand that Grzuul mightve been real, because Calliope claimed that all of her friends were real. She believed it with all her heart. When I asked her to introduce me to some of her friends, she would get quiet. The first time I asked, she stopped walking and took a moment to consider her decision. All she said was no that cant happen, with the utmost sincerity in her glance.

Curiosity wouldnt allow me to forget and when things appeared to be more serious than I thought, I asked Who are your friends, Calliope? The way she turned, as if relative motion ceased, craned her neck and turned her eyes, it was as if the girl Id known had disappeared. 

You cant do that, you know? she said. It just doesnt work that way.

I couldnt dare ask any more. The look in her eyes was blank, empty, missing that crucial element that made her the girl Id known. I worried more that shed been kidnapped in her own body, as if a desperate, parasitic soul had invaded her and pushed her deep into some abysmal nightmare for which shed never escape. I avoided everyone, including her the rest of the day. My parents came to my room and asked if I needed anything. I told them I was fine and I needed to be left alone. They seemed to understand, but reappeared every few hours with a drink or some food or just to ask if I needed anything. 

III

The question I asked myself was not a question, but a summation of her personality. It seemed impossible, after all, that a person could be so nice, sincere and caring. Not that people arent nice, but just her all the time! There were very few lulls in the joy of it all. Even at such a young age, I knew that being happy all the time wasnt possible. About two years before, my grandmother died and, until Calliopes disappearance, this would be the saddest day ever. I knew of sadness, even at such a young age. She had to know, but she couldnt acknowledge it, because the voices wouldnt let her. 

The day passed into night. I dont remember coming to any deeper understandings of the situation, when I heard her knocking at the window. She always came when the darkness was first settling, as if to be certain that the light wouldnt be making any surprise appearances. I doubt she understood the significance, but something inside her did. Her smile seemed twisted, although I assume it was more my perception than anything. She was still the young, innocent and beautiful girl Id known. There was just a little darkness, something for her to escape. 

I let her into my room. She took my glass of orange soda without asking, and then took a big bite of the grilled cheese sandwich my mother made. She didnt speak, as she ate the entire thing and swallowed down the full glass of orange soda. 

The voices arent my friends after all, she said. Its the wind. I spoke to the wind.

What are you talking about?

She gave me a kiss. It was my first kiss. It hurts, because I can look back on my first kiss without shame, because I know I loved her, but am overwhelmed by a complex sense of joy, confusion and regret. I guess thats how it should be. She climbed out of the window and disappeared. I wanted to tell her not to go wherever she would be going. I didnt. She wasnt the type of person that listened or cared about others opinions. She spoke to the wind. That was the only opinion that mattered.

Im always amazed by the stories of people missing, especially when they never find their bodies. Its amazing that a person can be here one day and then, as if from some miracle close to the divine, theyre gone. Theyre just gone. You have no clear avenue to follow, where youd find their body and know exactly what happened. You have clues. You have impressions and ideas based on facts, but the truth you need, something her parents would need to support them into a future without their beautiful daughter simply put, is never, ever there. 

I was far too young to learn about regret. At any age, you dont know what to do with it, so you carry it around for a while and see how it feels. Its terrible, especially at the age of ten. I was ten years old, regretting not saying something about this beautiful, unique angel in human form. She wasnt meant to exist in this world. Thats how I get through the day. You deal with regrets of moments from your youth by, not lying, but making up fanciful stories to help the narrative along. I deal with what I perceive as allowing Calliope to believe her stories, because I tell myself there was nothing I could do. I dont believe that, but it gets me through. 

After her disappearance, it took several weeks before the police were done talking to everyone in our small town. The police and all their questions were frightening and, although I know they meant for the best, I was young and terrified. I dont blame them, as I look back, but when it was happening I was too young to handle it. I was dealing with the loss of someone I loved very dearly. I think that maybe I was their only link to anything concrete that mightve led to finding her.

It wasnt long after her disappearance that the police found the box. Someone had been living in a box by a crick in the woods. It was full of empty cans, old soiled blankets and loose articles of clothing, some of which belonged to children. None of the clothing appeared to belong to Calliope.

After that, I couldnt keep her secrets. I told the police everything I knew. I told them about her voices and about Grzuul and about the box, which shed described exactly as theyd found it. I was so optimistic. I thought this would be the moment that changed everything. I could feel the shifting of time and fate toward something terrific and inspiring that never came. Nothing came of it, really. I was such a stupid kid I didnt realize until years later that the police already understood that she had been kidnapped and none of these voices had been responsible. 

When I tried to explain that Grzuul was one of the voices, well, they didnt care. I was a kid. They were operating on what little facts they had. I understand that now, but I didnt as a young boy, so I ran home and cried for about a week.

A few days after my thirteenth birthday, I asked my parents if we could move. My aunt and uncle lived in the city, which was a few hours away, so I asked if we could maybe look for a house or an apartment. I needed to be far from this place. Clues to Calliopes disappearance were all around me, yet after a few years of trying I wanted closure. I wanted to give up, but really, I wanted her. I wanted my friend back and, in knowing that would never happen I wanted to be somewhere else. It exhausted me to devote all my time to her, but it was all I could do. I wouldnt give up until it killed me, so I had to get away. 

It took almost an entire year for them to be able to sell our house and get everything in order, but we did it. We moved to the city and I thought everything would be fine. I had trouble fitting in, but I found a group of friends who welcomed me. I was getting better at focusing during class. Our grade had its own newspaper and I loved to write, especially about current events, so I joined that. People really seemed to enjoy what I did, so I continued it into high school. I went to college and got a degree in journalism and in no time got a job writing for a local paper. It was mostly fluff about whose cat is the fattest? or which city bakes the best cherry pies? but I didnt care.

One day, as Im walking alone down the street, I see her and all of those memories hit me over the head. The woman I saw was fully grown, but the girl I remember is still ten years old. I know I saw a woman. Her hair was dry, straggly, no longer bright and blonde as I remembered. Her eyes were crazed, twitching by this or that roaming wave of thought. Her fingers were long and thin, like talons. Her index finger pointed right at me. A heavy brown blanket rested over her shoulders. 

Calliope! I screamed. I must have startled her, because she ran. I couldnt chase for long, before I lost her. I hated myself for losing her again, but continued to look around for an hour, until I had to give up on finding her all over again!

That night hurt, because I thought I was over her and now I realized I had only been hiding. My mind wouldnt stop. I tried to think of some way that I could figure out what happened to her, when I heard a knock on my window. I went to the window. There wasnt anyone there. I opened the window and looked out to the city. It was always busy, no matter the time. The darkness settled, when I heard a whisper from below, 

I spoke to angels you know?

Calliope was sitting on my fire escape with her head down, eyes staring through the metal grates. I thought she was going to jump, so I wrapped my arms around her. It felt good to hug her, something I never got to do as a boy. I lost myself in that moment and cried like a baby. She was still whispering, but I wasnt listening, even as she smeared blood all over my clean, white button-up shirt. I saw the blood and panic seized my entire body. Id never felt such loss of control, as I pushed away from the window. I saw everything in slow motion, as my body pushed away from her. She crawled into the open window, like some nightmarish figure from a horror movie. Her limbs were long and crooked, arched at impossible angles and void of almost all muscle. She could barely walk, as her small, bony feet bent along the carpet, before she crept down on her knees. She brought out one hand from beneath her blanket, as the other moved her along the carpet. She made this noise, as if breathing, wheezing from her throat, until the air escaped to make the sound of a wounded animal that still possessed enough fight to be a threat. 

A little blood decorated the free hand, which she kept out in front of her. She moved within a few feet of me, before throwing off the blanket. She wore several layers of clothes, but the surface layer was painted in crimson. Blood spattered over her clothes. She presented me with her other hand, bringing it together with the other. There was far more blood in this hand, but I couldnt see it, as she held something that appeared like a large balloon that lost all of its air. It was a human heart. 

Calliope, I whispered. What happened to you?

Grzuul promised me she said. He promised he was a promiser She cried. I never got the answers I needed. I called the police and she got the care she deserved. Her parents I cant explain I wont explain the overwhelming wonder of that day. They moved to the city so that they would be around, while their daughter got the care she so desperately needed. I see her every week, but I never ask her about the voices. She doesnt really talk about them (or to them) anymore. 

Mostly, its just nice to be around the person I loved. She knows that shes somehow ill and wants nothing more than to get better. She talks to everyone at the center and tells me all of their stories. She points them out to me when I visit and laughs at what she thinks are quirks. I go along with it, like I always did, because theres little you can do when Calliope gets to talking. She seems to be herself, but every so often, I notice the nose angled slightly upward, as her eyes make that ascent. Shell be more careful, having made far too many mistakes in the past. Shell look around to see if anyone notices, as they often do, as shes under twenty-four hour supervision. Still, I know shell wait, until shes cleared to return to her parents and then who knows.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few times a day, my brain will make these momentary excursions, which is nothing I can help until I can wake up. It recedes into memory and returns to that place. This never happens when I'm asleep. I don't dream. I wake from these momentary lapses and feel the sweat beading along my forehead. I remind myself, "you're not there", repeating it, until I understand. The words should bring me comfort, because my greatest fear is alive in that distant world. I can't stop thinking about a return, because, despite experiencing what would be my greatest terror, my memory goes back to the times of overwhelming joy. I knew and loved greater than I thought possible. Afghanistan meant something to me, before time came to corrupt it. The horrors we experienced in my last few days in that world are something I never thought I'd be able to discuss.

I was a journalist who took on a free-lance operation to learn about 'the conditions of the people living in Afghanistan'. I wasn't part of any military operations, but more of a humanitarian aid (although I'm certain most of our research was done to help the military). The world wanted to know about the people of Afghanistan and our study meant broadening their perceived notions of a part of a world that everyone thinks they know. The scope was meant to cover the entirety of what is known as 'The Middle East', although my expertise was Afghanistan. I thought I knew a lot about the country, but it was only in living with its people, being accepted as an equal and offering the same to them, that I truly understood these proud, noble people. 

Military operations had taken off in most of the country. Locals didn't think much of it at the time, although they understood that the 'western presence' would expand, most possessed an impossible optimism that things were about to get better. Everyone operated under an assumed certainty that their towns would last through the occupation and that those in power would be brought to justice. The increased military presence meant an end to a theocratic regime that had proven brutal and calculating. The locals were happy to see them uprooted and removed from power and even welcomed the foreign armies in establishing what they would believe to be a 'democracy unlike any other'. 

We dealt with the military on several levels. Most of this story remains classified. Specific names or regions have been changed or otherwise removed, as I'm no longer certain what's still being told to the public, which stories are lies and which have to be seen to be believed. When the military presence expanded they told us we're taking on several risks remaining in these enclaves. They told us that if anything happened, we could try to contact a few outposts that'd been there since before the war, but never the embassies. I assumed these were 'black-list' sites for whatever secretive operations they had in mind. 

The occupation came on slowly, before the real invasion. It wasn't long before I noticed these allegedly covert 'black-list' sites hiding in plain sight. The most obvious tell, and one of the great blunders in military intelligence, was a building along the edge of town. They made it into, not necessarily a bar, but a cafe where foreigners could find a limited source of alcohol. Bars are rare in the area, but only because they're not meant for the locals. Foreigners hide out in the bars for hours on end. There were more of them coming in, as the operation took on full-force. Other outsiders appeared out of nowhere, claiming to be from all over the country, yet the people of our city couldn't identify the person or their 'so-called' lineage.

For the most part, especially before the invasion, Afghanistan greeted me with open arms. All I ever wanted in learning about these people was to shape minds around the idea that we're all equals, hoping to live our lives in relative peace, for as long as we can. I just wanted to help, but nothing is ever so simple. People make it difficult to help them. There were a few who spoke out against my presence, as they saw me as an extension of the military. They became much more vocal with the coming occupation. 

I remember one man, upon seeing me, muttered a few words in his native tongue that I later learned translated to 'white wet dog', which I assumed he called me because at the time I was covered in sweat. My hair, which is long and curly, along with my beard, was matted to my head. In his defense, a 'white wet dog' is also how I'd describe myself. He yelled and spit at the ground, shaking his hands with such anger. I'm not a religious man, but I took it as a curse. He cursed my color, creed and most likely my nationality. 

On a few occasions, some locals showed hostility to my presence, but I always thought it had more to do with the expanding militarism of foreign governments in their country. For the most part, I knew plenty of the locals and was greeted as an equal. Afghanistan will remain a blessing to me, no matter what it is now. One family and a man by the name of Khasir were polite enough to show me more about their culture than I'll ever remember. They provided me with food and water and told me all about their family. A discussion about family takes hours for most people from this town, as they have to go back generations, combing through the fine details of their great ancestors and performing an amazing 'grand-standing' ceremony, as they make their way to their own children. 

I

The company I worked for paid Khasir and his family. In return, he showed me around and allowed me a room to rent. Khasir introduced me to his circle of friends and they all greeted me with the same surprising warmth. It isn't most outsiders that are greeted in this way, but because of who I was with, Khasir being a man of great standing in this town, they accepted me with open arms. The world was changing and the locals weren't greeting people they didn't know. They saw the times changing. Everyone went on the defensive, while I hid in plain sight, able to walk freely through the town, because of my good friend, Khasir. 

He had a group of four friends who visited one of the friend's homes. The owner of the house was Yinzani and, to me, he was an interesting character. He loved what he called 'American culture' and displayed three posters in his basement. The posters were 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' (Arnold was his favorite action star), 'Blazing Saddles' and (my personal favorite), 'Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?' I loved all of these movies and Yinzani's obvious affection for 'American culture' made it much easier for me to fit in. Yinzani possessed at least the same level of respect as Khasir. He was the loudest member of the group, yet whenever he'd get too passionate over one of their discussions, people would still observe the rules of his home and would never raise their voices. 

They'd get together in his home once a week and discuss politics. Politics for them revolved around happenings in and around the city, while, of course, they couldn't help but discuss the 'foreign occupation'. They didn't care as much for world politics (except for that which they were forced to understand). They cared about each other's families and friends, as well as the upholding of their traditions. History and bloodlines meant a lot to them, especially in a town of between twenty-thousand and forty-five thousand. The way they talked you'd think everyone knew everyone, because their histories were intricately knotted together.

World history and politics took on new life, as I immersed myself in their culture, but it was nothing compared to the folklore and traditions of these modern people. Something I always enjoyed is mythology and, in particular, the folk traditions of common, everyday people. Folklore has always been different to me from mythology. Mythology is something dead people believed. Folklore is alive. It's the breath and wisdom of the world around us. Folklore is what we told ourselves, because we 'couldn't step on a crack or we'd break our mother's back'. It was a stupid, amusing anecdote when we were children, imagining that an old man would steal our souls if we ventured over his impossibly tall fence to retrieve a baseball. Folklore took on the necessity for an explanation, when we hadn't the tools or the desire to do so.

I had a feeling that the traditions of Khasir and his friends hadn't changed too much over the past few hundred years. One of the things they discussed was a myth about a wild dog that hunted children in the night. They claimed one had taken a few children over several years, until it was finally caught. Others claimed that the dogs were massive and could walk upright, even going so far as to run and attack like a man. They claimed the dogs had an insatiable lust for their women, but especially loved tearing their men apart, piece by piece. 

II

The military, between the Afghan Guard, International Police and the U.S. Armed Forces, never spoke directly to me. They did, however, recommend a few things to people that I worked for, involving me and where I should operate in order to stay out of their way. There were no real 'safe havens' left in the country, especially as the foreign presence multiplied, but the town was far from what would be called a 'hot zone' for militant Islamic terrorists. I didn't go into these hot zones often, as we were under strict orders from the military, as well as our bosses, that we were only allowed in this area because we wouldn't be reporting on their work in Afghanistan. They didn't want too much information leaking out. All media had to be controlled, which I understood, not as a journalist, but as a man who thought he was doing a good thing for the 'real people of Afghanistan'.

One of the things the military warned my superiors, who, in turn, warned me against, was a man within Khasir's inner circle by the name of Ruftali. He was a well known associate to some individuals who operated against the Afghani military, not the U.S., but a specific sect of militant Arabs that wanted a return to 'The First Tribe'. He belonged to a cult under the guise of Islam that worshipped a demon, Abunnan, known in English as 'the crow eater'. Abunnan was a dog that learned to walk upright and loved to consume human flesh. When I say he loved eating flesh, I mean it. He cut off people's skin and let it dry and would use it to make different sets of armor. Abunnan wanted our blood, because he believed it to be a 'sacrament from the divine' and would use it in dark rituals to pay homage to his mischievous gods. 

The overall consensus from those of us that worked as journalists in Afghanistan, which is not to say all of the Middle East, is that most media outlets took it upon themselves to run with an 'us vs. them' mentality. It was easy enough to mold a few million followers out of 'America at War', when people weren't sure what that meant. We weren't thinking about Al Qaeda one minute before what occurred on 9/11. In truth, we looked to the Middle East as a world of lunatics that was too complicated for our involvement. Now, although I think this is still partly true, I think of it all as organized chaos. It's presented as an archetype for insanity. The media paints the simple portrait of total madness and everyone floats around it, like those little fish that follow around the Great White Shark. The image is irresistible for its simplicity. People are much more eager to ingest a simple narrative. We take what little we can, what our media decides to bless us with, which is usually piece-meal, much like the Pilot Fish.

My town came into conflict with the U.S. military, because they viewed it as what is called a 'Sanctuary City'. A lot of Afghani guardsmen deserted their posts and tried to hide out with us, although, after a few days, they usually returned. If they didn't leave of their own volition, someone came for them. It was but a few occasions that a man would be dragged off, kicking and screaming, while most of us turned a blind eye. On the other side of that, we also saw plenty of former Islamic militants. Most locals ignored them, as they would only come here so that they might find safe passage out of the country. The locals thought they were doing a good thing, helping get rid of the radicalized element that helped bring this hell upon our country. The foreign militaries, however, were annoyed by our 'hands-off approach' to what they saw as 'consorting with the enemy'. Most of these Islamic militants, although the locals didn't know them, were known in some way. They had family ties through relatives and friends, for which the people of our city couldn't turn away. Our leniency annoyed several military officials, who claimed that some locals were providing weapons and food. Although, I can't speak for that, I do know that nobody knew what to do. They were damned by their traditions, while they did their best to maintain 'international law'. It wasn't in their tradition to turn away a fellow 'keeper of the faith', which had seen me welcomed into Khasir's home, as well as Yinzani's.

III

One day, a man came into one of the cafes along the outskirts of the city, which was an assumed military outpost. He slunk down into his chest and into the stool, with his elbows resting on a counter that looked out toward miles of desert. At one point, he started crying and a local came over to console him. Not long into their discussion, something changed and both men started yelling. The outsider kicked over the stool, yelling about demons roaming the desert that would descend upon the city and gut them in front of their loved ones. A group dressed in black, showing only their eyes dragged the man away. The locals turned the other way, as the man was forcefully brought out of the bar, thrown into the middle of the street and mercilessly beaten. One of the men held him down, while the others kicked and punched. They yelled something I couldn't understand at the time, which I learned after was a great insult. They called him 'shit dog', before knocking him senseless and dragging him away.

I had to ask who that man was and who had taken him away. Khasir reluctantly told me that the man, Benazir, had run away a few months back to join the fight against the American Insurgency. Hed packed up and left, but now claimed that devils hunted him in the desert. He claimed to have abandoned his post and while he tried to make his way home, a pack of wild dogs found him. They chased after him for a while, until they climbed up on two feet. They cackled and howled, as he ran for his life. 

Benazir claimed to have come back to warn them. He claimed he knew that hed be taken, but he had to warn his family. He begged for someone to get his family out of here. He begged and screamed, before being beaten and dragged away. 

IV

About a week later, I had my first experience with the international police. They drove to the city and established a perimeter, before their commander walked into our town, like a conquering hero. People hid in their homes, while those on the streets tried to become invisible. A town official walked up and shook his hand. They walked towards the perimeter of the city. They spoke far enough away that we couldn't hear. There was a lot of nodding, each man making points, to which the other countered, still in agreement, before the commander put out his hand. They shook and made as if everything would be fine. The commander and the rest of his entourage drove off. Our assumptions became far too optimistic. 

The official, Ahmud Kazan, walked back to the town, where he was immediately bombarded with questions. He said 'the United States military is evacuating the area' and that 'we were to leave immediately and take what we could'. Apparently a private company bought the town and needed them out so they could establish a base of operation to aid in the war on terror. They said there was a specific mandate from the United States government brought to the United Nations that gave them eminent domain over all territories they would defend. 

The locals didnt take it well, but they were left with no other options. A group of them banded together and said they would kill anyone who threatened their ancestry, including foreign invaders. The official said that the international police wouldn't stop and that if they didnt leave they faced certain death. People remained stubborn, even spitting at their own official and claiming him to be a white wet dog. He left us with the warning and disappeared. 

A few of us tried to convince everyone that leaving was the only option, but the stubbornness of the Afghani people cannot be overstated. I tried to tell Khasir we should follow the official and disappear, but the town meant so much to him. Yinzani was also reluctant. Hed made quite a collection of 'Western memorabilia' and refused to leave it behind. Everyone tried to explain that both he and the memorabilia wouldnt survive, but he remained stubborn. 

A few towns had received the same mandate weeks before and had refused to leave. There was a common belief that it was a tactic of foreign governments and businesses to scare indigenous people into voluntarily relinquishing the rights to their land. They could use a specific clause, claiming they'd 'abandoned their personal property' (homes and, in most cases, entire towns), so they could then claim that the property belonged to them.

One week later, local administrators found Ruftali dead. Hed been dragged out to the desert and torn to pieces. They followed a trail of blood, starting in front of a cafe, with a pool of crimson and leading through the town. Whatever attacked him cut deep enough for the blood to be mixed with something green and black, which I took as bile. There was never a chance of escape. The creature dragged him by his throat into the desert. It tore him apart. His innards had been ripped out and all evidence pointed to the creature(s) playing, chewing, twisting into knots and making toys out of his insides. Bite marks lined what was left of his legs, which were torn from his body and tossed aside. His eyes had been sucked out of their sockets and his tongue was missing. The look from his empty facial cavities is something I'll never forget.

People speculated for hours on what couldve done this to Ruftali. The rumors came back around about him having ties to known terrorist organizations and everyone concluded that some outsiders had gone to the trouble of making an example of him.

One of the city's officials tried contacting the authorities to assist in an investigation for the murder of Ruftali, but the only comment they offered on the matter was that 'it is not the place of the international policing community to involve foreign militaries in domestic affairs'. The local officials had been cut off. Those in charge refused to accept our invitations for town meetings and had their spokesman explain their position, over and over again.

Life continued like normal for about a day and a half, but night brought the lurking menace of fate, as well as the inevitable. We awoke to screams. People ran out of their homes and were greeted by men in black robes waving torches and swinging machetes. They chanted in some language that nobody knew, while some swung long sticks that rattled with every shake. They hissed and whispered curses of death and damnation on the world. Nobody moved, as they marched into our town and pummeled anyone who walked into the street. 

Most of us kept our distance and they left us alone. Those who walked off their property were attacked. They leapt like wild apes, grabbing people by their ears and throwing them to the ground, where they kicked and clawed, as the victims cried out for mercy. They grabbed a few of the women away from their partners, but when they did, everyone tried to stop them. The violence erupted, as the invading army collapsed over us and everyone scattered. They made several sounds that echoed over the night sky, hissing and chanting mixed with a nefarious cackle, like hyenas finding a fresh carcass. 

They fought their way out of our town, kidnapping a few of the women and leaving their husbands crying, pleading for their return. Some of the people, having lost someone they loved more than life itself, followed them out into the desert, where they would die. Others followed along by some warped hypnosis and would forever be their slaves.

VI

Written in blood on a wall at the edge of town were the words 'The night belongs to us' (translated). They branded our town, as if it belonged to them. It was enough to inflict terror and, at the same time, inspire an overwhelming rage. The next night, we enacted a plan to prevent them from taking our homes. We hid between four houses that were close enough to each other that they might be easier to defend. We decided that all women and children had to go. It would be easier to defend the city without putting them in danger. We gathered all the weapons from around the city, which wasnt much for our plan, but enough to mount a resistance and, hopefully, scare them away.

Khasir made his case for staying, while everyone told him to leave with his family. He was a man of great standing in the community, who didn't understand that his 'community' no longer existed. He wouldnt leave if others were staying. He was a testament to the stubbornness and tenacity of the Afghani people, as well as most of the men of the 'Middle East'. After kissing his wife and children goodbye, Khasir joined our militia. 

Yinzani was also far too stubborn. Everyone understood or at least recognized the imminent danger, but he couldnt be coerced into parting with his belongings. He built something around himself, beyond his home and possessions, which belonged to the community, as well as his reputation. It meant something to him to exist at this moment in time, in this place and to have been born around these people.

Nobody wants to believe their world can disappear in a flash. I believe it all the more, as I read through history and see the inevitable manifesting through the impossible. Nobody wants to believe that the worst form of evil can be done unto them. Nobody thinks like that. Even when it's at your front door, you hold onto what hope is there and pray for the best.

We were able to make his home into a defensive perimeter, while doing the same in three other houses around it. We contacted each other every half an hour, while we occupied our minds telling stories and playing cards. Nobody could pay attention to the stories. Our eyes were anywhere but here. It was a desperate notion that we'd be able to see them and not be in danger. More than anything, we wondered if it would happen as easily as it had the night before. The demons would walk into our town, taking whatever they wanted and escaping into the night with their loot and almost no resistance.

A voice echoed from outside and everyone froze. We broke down and hid. They spoke, but used their guttural language. I asked what they said, but nobody knew. They claimed to have never heard the dialect and claimed that the person had to be from a foreign army. It wasnt English, that much I knew, but within their fragmented sentences I heard them grunting. Theyd hiss after some sentences. When the words they spoke were an affront to their beliefs they bit at each other and would snort to show disdain. 

They muttered these words that sounded familiar, because I'd been called the exact same thing. It took me a minute, but I realized they spoke the same words as the man who spit at me wet white dog. They were breathing me in and chasing down my scent. They said it over and over, as they circled the block, before coming right back. After a moment to be sure, the soldiers came to Yinzanis house and knocked on the door. 

Yinzani refused to answer. The soldiers knocked again. Khasir buckled and started towards the door, but everyone held him back. He thought twice and contained himself, pushing through the crowd and stepping to the back of the room. 

Yinzani, one of the soldiers said and then knocked on the door. He repeated the name with his voice getting deeper. 

Yinzani got up and, with a look of uncertainty, opened the door. Looking from a crowd of people thatd gathered in Yinzanis home, I saw five soldiers with the faces of disgusting mongrels. Their snouts had well-pronounced scars and bumps, as well as sores that glistened in a bright red that appeared ready to pop at any moment. Their eyes were sharp and fierce. They sniffed at the air and repeated the words, wet white dog, before ordering Yinzani out of the apartment and closing the door. 

They spoke for several minutes, before Yinzani returned. Everyone charged Yinzani and demanded that he tell them what they said. He said that they were the army of god and we had fifteen minutes to escape before they killed us all. He said they would honor their gods with our blood and burn our village to the ground. They offered no hope for sanctuary, as theirs was the wrath of god, which could not be denied. 

VII

After making this overwhelming announcement, Yinzani walked to his room. He couldve collapsed right there, as the certainty of his fate became all too clear. Everyone panicked and fled for their lives. Khasir and I followed Yinzani to his room. He stood at the window, staring over the city, which now sat in almost total darkness. The night sky was made all the more beautiful by the lack of electricity. Several of the buildings have some form of electricity, but the invaders must have disabled it moments before they assaulted our town. Shadowy figures stirred from the unassuming black that shrouded the desert in mystery. The rattling of their wooden canes echoed against the backdrop of stars, as they cackled like hyenas and invaded with every intention of erasing our existence from history. 

It took much more effort than it should to get Yinzani to abandon his home, but the sight of the dark figures creeping into the city was made all the more jarring by the rattling of their sticks twisting in the night. It drove us all a little crazy and made us wish to abandon everything we held sacred. We pulled Yinzani together and headed for the roof. We went from rooftop to rooftop for as long as we could, which brought us five houses down from where wed started. 

We stopped when we heard the rattles. They followed a simple rhythm, until they were close enough to attack, in which case they spun faster. It felt only natural to stop and listen, as the rattle hit a manic pitch and the beasts chomped down on an unsuspecting victim. Their cries resounded over the darkness. We covered our ears, but I'll never forget, as the nightmares from the desert hunted everyone like animals. 

We have to get out of town! Khasir ordered. We can't hide forever!

There was nowhere to go. We reached the end of the row of buildings, finding a door on the last roof. Khasir put his shoulder into it, but the door wouldnt budge. The wild beasts found the house and in no time were on the other side, hissing and chanting in their indecipherable language. They demanded the flesh of the wet white dog, as their maniacal laugher filled the air with a sense of inescapable defeat.

Yinzani made for the edge of the roof and told us to jump. I was the first to tell him that wouldnt be happening, but he didnt listen and made the leap. He landed with a painful thud and then tried to walk it off. In no time at all, the mongrels surrounded. They were a pack of wild dogs in military uniforms. They pounced on our friend and dragged him by his throat, eviscerating him in front of the building, as he screamed through the pain. He begged for god to end his life, as the soldiers ran on two feet and then, as they approached Yinzani, crept on all four limbs. They growled and feasted on his body, while we looked on.

I couldnt watch, but the sounds of their chewing, teeth ripping into sinew and then drinking, sucking down his blood, echoed over the cascade of houses. They broke down the door to the roof, cackling like hyenas and crying out for the wet white dog. We leapt like mad towards Yinzanis home, but could only make it two houses over, before they made a terrific leap and took out our legs. They tied us up and dragged us along the row of buildings, where we heard a rumor of the bloodshed. Our brethren cried out for mercy, pleading for a righteous god, not to put an end to their suffering, but to erase this plague of vile dog-men from the planet.

They allowed us to stare off into the black city, as it descended into obscene violence and died without even a whimper. After that, they took us away.

VIII

We awoke with cold water splashing over our faces, suspended upside-down with our hands tied behind our backs. They demanded we renounce our gods. I screamed for mercy and relinquished whatever beliefs I had. I believed in nothing most of my life, but I wouldve renounced the name of my father to escape. I heard the knife going into Khasir, but couldnt see, as the blade jabbed into his flesh over and over. The beast cackled and laughed in Khasir's face, as his life faded into oblivion. 

The dog-men kept repeating the words wet white dog, as they eviscerated Khasir and smeared his blood over their faces. They challenged each other with savagery, each seeming to enjoy the bloodshed more than the last. My heart skipped a beat. The weight of my skull was cumbersome, as the darkness entered my vision. It didnt take me, mind you, but offered an escape. I thought Id never wake up again, so I fought it. The mongrel twisted his face around so that we were at the same level. He repeated the term 'wet white dog', as they tore me from the restraints and took me away.

I awoke blindfolded in the back of a van. Nobody said anything. Twisting against the ropes holding my wrists did nothing to deter them. The car came to a stop and they took me out, dragged me to a building and tied me to a chair. I was bound and gagged and left in total darkness for about an hour, when I heard them return. They came down without a word, before undoing my restraints and removing the blindfold. 

The commander greeted me, along with a few other soldiers or at least mercenaries of one of the companies that worked in the area. They took me away and it was the last I saw of the monsters. They moved back into the shadows and, as the years go by my mind pushes them further away. The commander brought me to an undisclosed location far from the city. It was my assumption that I would never make it out of this place. 

They told me, quite to the contrary, that I could continue my work until its completion and the expiration of my work visa. I asked if anything like whatd happened would ever happen again. He looked to me with a smile and said, We cant make any such promise. 

What happened? 

He crept in closer. "Nothing happened. You're to remain and finish the rest of your work. End of discussion." His smile revealed too many teeth. 

I'm still not sure what happened. The thought that I might've been the reward of a bunch of 'military grade hunting dogs' crossed my mind. They were animals that saw me as something to hunt. They needed to find the 'wet white dog' so they could earn their reward. It's the only thing that makes sense, despite being impossible and insane. It's what we experienced. They loved to hunt and were loyal to the hand that fed them. They were given a task, sniff out the wet white dog and bring him to us'. Nothing about the city mattered to them, except for their prize, 'the wet white dog'. 

He told me the area wouldn't be the same that I'd known and warned me about returning. I knew what was coming. The war was only going to make things worse. There were no more sanctuary cities. We either ran for our lives or died like dogs. </TEXT>
