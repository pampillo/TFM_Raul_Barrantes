<TEXT> I used to go out with a guy for a little while but things didn't work out but we remained close friends for years, he actually became my best friend. Then one night at a college leaving party, I got a little drunk and tried to make a move on him like the idiot drunk I am but he was being very subjective and overall trying to avoid me the whole night even before I started drinking... It wasn't until one of my friends took me aside and pointed out the obvious that I finally got it. Yeah I was an idiot to let me go at the time but as far as I know he's happy in a new relationship as am I so I guess all worked out in the end. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-02-18 02:12:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I currently have a 3 year old female cat who is very territorial. Even if she is just sitting at the window and another cat dares to even just pass on the crass she will hiss and scratch until we let her out for her to chase it. 

Last week we were offered the chance to buy a new kitten from a friend of my cousins, however, our cat being the way she is I don't know if it would be the best option as I don't know if she would ever accept the new cat on her 'land'. My mothers argument, however, is that by having another cat in the house it would help our cat to become more 'social' and give her a 'playmate'. 

I just want to know this subs opinion on the situation? what were your experiences when introducing another cat to the family home?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Heaven, God went missing for six days. Eventually, Archangel Michael found him on the seventh day resting. He enquired of God, 'Where have you been?' 
 
God pointed downwards through the clouds. Archangel Michael looked puzzled and said, 'What is it?' 
 
'It's a planet,' replied God, 'and I've put LIFE on it. I'm going to call it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance.' 
 
'Balance?' inquired Michael, still confused. 
 
God explained, pointing down to different parts of the Earth. 'For example, North America will be a place of great opportunity and wealth, while South America is going to be poor; the Middle East over there will be a hot spot, and Russia will be a cold spot. Over there I've placed a continent of white people and over there is a continent of black people.' 
 
God continued, pointing to the different countries. 
 
This one will be extremely hot and arid while this one will be very cold and covered in ice.' 
 
The Archangel, impressed by God's work, then pointed to another area of land and asked, 'What's that?' 
 
'Ah,' said God. That's the North of England, the most glorious place on earth. There are beautiful people, seven Premiership football teams in the North West alone, and many impressive cities; it is the home of the world's finest artists, musicians, writers, thinkers, explorers and politicians. The people from the North of England are going to be modest, intelligent and humorous and they're going to be found travelling the world. They'll be extremely sociable, hard-working and high-achieving, and they will be known throughout the world as speakers of truth.' 
 
Michael gasped in wonder and admiration but then proclaimed, 'What about balance God, you said there will be BALANCE!' 
 
God replied very wisely, 'Wait till you see the bunch of tossers I'm putting down South! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok first of all, before I get on to my point, can I just say how much I love and enjoy this subreddit. Its very rare that I miss a day without checking it out and going through people crazy theories etc and I love the whole community feel about it, which makes it a joy to be a part of. 

However, as much as I love this subreddit there is one aspect that annoys the bejesus out of me. 
The desire to make EVERY aspect of the book fit into a real life sense of meaning. 
What I mean when I say this is that, some fans have the habit of wanting to analyse every detail of the book and catch every little loophole or mistake that JK may have made in the book.
For example I have just come across as post that points out that Lupin wouldn't have made the mistake of missing his wolfsbane potion because of his character and that the fact that the event just 'happened' to occur on a full moon.

IT IS A STORY. Thought up for purely entertainment purposes, without little loopholes or some characters not acting as you know they would in later books or things happening in certain dates or certain things happening then there wouldn't be a story at all! There episode be no meaning behind the words and it wouldn't flow and it would be boring and I guarantee this fandom wouldn't exist (or be as large) because there would nothing to get excited about. 

I guess what I am trying to say is stop over analysing everything in the series. Yes the little details are great and it's super exciting when a new fan theory comes out or JK lets something else slip about the magical world that makes us fall in love with it that little bit more (if it's even possible). Like I said in the beginning that's what makes me love fandom and this subreddit but sometimes we have just got to let the MAGIC BE MAGIC. Because over analyising can sometimes take that MAGIC away and that kind of defeats the purpose of the books. </TEXT>

It's the the morning of Dudley's 11th birthday, all 36 birthday presents are surrounding him. He feasts on his breakfast at the table, being doted on by his parents, when there perfect scene is interrupted by the ruffle of wings and hoot of a bird as it flies through the open window and drops a parchment envelope into the middle of the breakfast table, the hogwarts wax stamp glistening...

<TITLE> Why is female masterbation such a taboo subject to talk about? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-06 12:40:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Men talked about masterbation openly for a number of years now, so much that we have come to accept that male masterbation is to be expected and we don't even give it a second thought when it is brought up.

However, female masterbation is still seems to be such a hush hush subject, not only publicly but between friendship groups and relationships aswell. I, for one, have friends that cringe and shy away or quickly move on to another subject if it is brought up in casual conversation and within the last year I have talked a friend into trying masterbation for the first time and she did and she loved it (we are both nearly 20). 

I guess what I want to know, is your thoughts and opinions on why it is still so hushed up when we seem to be living in a world that seems to be embracing sex more and more.

Do you guys have any advice? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Google chrome adds: Extension not worked </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the past couple of weeks I have been seeing the very annoying pop up ads and Link ads every time I have come on to Google chrome. I have tried going on to the actual ad provider website to disable it several times but it just re enables it self straight away, even when they inform you that it shouldn't. 

Having no luck this way, I decided to Google it and all I got were suggestions to download the Google extension 'ad block'. So I downloaded this but it doesn't seem to have done anything! I am running out of patience for these annoying ads as they are making my Laptop slower and will often crash the Google Chrome browser so I am forced to shut it down! 

Can anyone here suggest a solution? HELP!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is about my media teacher, Not to bad, but it pissed me of big time! 

So my English and media class shared the same class room which had only one display bored in the whole room. As a part of my coursework for my English class I was asked to design a display for the display board for an open evening. So for a whole day I get permission to skip classes to work on it, it took me whole day as it was pretty big. However I could not find any glue or staples and so needed up just sticking the work up with blue tack until the next day when I could hopefully, attach it up properly. 

Next day, my first class is media. Teacher comes in and gives us work to do. We set about it and as we're about half way through I start to see some of my display work landing on the desk. I look up and see my media teacher taking down all the work I spent all day putting up an arranging neatly, as well as taking down the boarder and paper back I used as a base for the board! At this point me and my friends are just starting gob smaked as they knew how long it took me! 

I proceed to tell her and all he turns around and says is "well I needed this board for my media display" bear in mind however that pretty much the whole room except one wall is covered in work from past media students as well as a whole load of media related displays! To make it work she them took some of her own media work from her bag as well as a glue stick and glued it to the board! 

I was so pissed, I told my English teacher who was also head of the English and media department, she had a word and me and some friends we're aloud to take it down and start my board again. The subject was never brought up again but I did start receiving a lot of dirty looks and snappy responses from my media teacher for the rest of the year  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It started a week after we got her when she was 6 weeks old and I blamed it on her age, she was just playing, teething didnt know any better, but now she is older (12 weeks) it's getting a bit too rough, in her mind she is still playing but it's not fun for us anymore. We have tried shouting and snaking her on the nose every time and for a few of my family members it had worked but she still continues to bite and scratch me and my brother.

Have any of you got any advice on how we can stop her? Any special teething toys we can get her?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sadly, I was one of these kids. The chances are they are probably just shy so when you have set everyone to work and no one is really paying attention to anything else around them, go up to the person and ask if they have any questions. That way they wont worry about sounding 'stupid' in front of there classmates and they will have your full attention to get a real answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I were you, I would way up the pros and cons of telling her and not telling her and think about both the actions and consequences of your decision. E.g. If you told her and she didn't feel the same way, how is that going to effect your relationship with her, do you really want to put that kind of strain on it? Will you be able to work past it and just carry on as before? 
Really consider every pro's and con's with care.

If you decide to tell her, great! Well done for gathering up the courage, she will admire you for that. 

Good luck :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really agree with this. I did not see the point either, they could of portrayed Harry and Ginny's relationship in numerous ways throughout the film, like they have in the book. It's like you said with the whole Voldermort thing, they totally contradicted themselves here with that. 

The only other thing I cant think of is that they put it in to add more action and get that in the film early than just right at the end. Maybe to also introduce some more death eaters rather than just Bellatrix, so that when the final scene with Dumbledore on the tower came about, the audience wouldn't be like 'Who the hell are they?'

Still a really pointless scene, they should of stuck with the book and have the minister coming to visit Harry to try and get him on the ministry's side, lot more sense. 

Sorry for rant haha :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> In HBP when Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermionie are sitting by the common room fire and Ginny explains her discussion with Romilda Vain about Harry and his 'Tattoo'; 
"And what did you tell her Ron's got?" 
"A Pygmy Puff, but I didn't say where" 

Not only did I find it funny but it also highlights just how awesome and witty Ginny (My favourite charcter by far) is. Something I truly wish the movies had portrayed properly, making her a key character instead of the quiet as a mouse character you see her as. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have read that some of you can do online dating and things on your games and I thought it must just come with an expansion pack that I don't have, but then I saw someone say they had it on the sims 3 university, the only expansion pack I have, and someone commented saying it was a patch update so can you guys help me? It would be much appreciated :)

<TEXT> I really agree with this answer, I am not even 20 yet and even I realise this is a big mistake. You have practically given up very thing just to pay for this ring, I understands it's what she wants but that's all it is and it is really not worth it for the price, you can get cheaper brands as people have already mentioned so why pay this much. The chances are that she'll be so excited about you proposing and the idea of getting married to you and spending the rest of her life with you that she shouldn't care about what ring you got her.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this is what I would say to my 'friend' I I could

'Who the hell are you? Like literally I do not recognise you. 15 years of friendship and you think it is alright to talk down to me and treat me like shit everyday?! Yeah you may say it's a joke and at first I laughed along or took it on the chin or whatever but a joke only goes so far! 
I've been there for you nearly all your life, went through all of school together, been with you through everything but suddenly I'm not good enough for you? 
So what you think now that you are pratically anorexic and have evryone wanting you, that you're some kind of untouchable gold shit?! Just because you now have a 'friend' that can buy you all these things, which you flaunt in my face, that you can swag around with your fake posh accent pretending to be someone else?! Yeah I know the real you, you grew up on one of the roughest council estates in the area so loose the fucking accent! 
Do you have any idea how hard it feels to have your best friend of 15 years not take any ounce of interest in you for no apparent reason? To go off with this new friend who you seemed to have replaced me with all because she has money and then to never shut up about her all the bloody time! And I am not the only one annoyed by this I can assure tou of that! 
So Maybe I am a little jealous l, I will admit to that but can you blame me? Seriously. You make time for her but never for me, you don't invite me out anymore even to places with all our other friends, leaving me out. Oh you think you little miss popular dont you? 
Despite me feeling this way though, for now, I still care about you, I would still be there for you whenever you need me despite what I may feel against you!'

That felt good. </TEXT>

There are 3 women sitting on a bench eating ice cream. One is delicately liking the sides of a triple scoop ice cream, the second is gobbling down the top and sucking the cone and the third is biting of the top of the ice cream. Which one is married?" The teacher blushes and replies "well I guess the one that is gobbling down top and sucking the cone" "the correct answer is the one with the wedding ring on, but I like your thinking"

He's into the fake kind of girl I guess and I am anything but fake, I am totally against the whole fake thing. Stupid barbies.

<TEXT> A rather confident man walks into a bar and takes a seat next to a very attractive woman. He gives her a quick glance then casually looks at his watch for a moment. The women notices this and asks, "Is your date running late?" "No", he replies "I just bought this state-of-the-art watch and I was just testing it." The intrigued women says "a state-of-the-art watch? What's so special about it?" "It uses alpha waves to telepathically talk to me" he explains. "What's it telling you right now?" "We'll it says your not wearing panties..." The woman giggles and replies, "Well it must be broken because I am wearing panties" The man explains, "Damn thing must be an hour fast" </TEXT>

<TEXT> My 16 yr old 'friend' did this. She had a daughter that lived for about an hour due to all these problems which include multiple fingers on one hand disformation on the feet etc. 

Anyway once the baby had passed, she decided to dress the baby up and take a whole lot of picture of her cuddling it and sitting it up with her teddy bear and stuff. 

I guess this was just her way of grieving for her lost child but what made it even more weird was that she posted it all over her Facebook page and still continues to do so. It's just a bit unnerving seeing all these pictures of this baby all dressed up like it's alive and well whilst knowing that it is actually deceased in all the pictures. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lupin was always a very serious character in the books and although he did bond with him some what in the 3rd book I think they never really connected emotionally unlike how he did Sirius. Sirius was his dads closest dearest best friend, they knew each other ringside out, the thing harry has always dreamed of knowing so I think to harry Sirius was that link he was missing from his parents to himself, after all he is his god father. Also Sirius always told harry the straight out truth, or at least wanted to, about everything going on where as everyone else dodged around it trying to protect him when they were actually doing the opposite, so this brings them even closer  </TEXT>
