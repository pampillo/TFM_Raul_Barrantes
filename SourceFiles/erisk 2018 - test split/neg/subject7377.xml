<TEXT> Generic is for most use cases (servers and workstations). Low latency is for specialized builds - mostly dedicated audio editing systems to my knowledge. 

If you are running 64 bit then you want to grab:

1.   linux-headers-4.10.1-041001_4.10.1-041001.201702260735_all.deb
   
2. linux-headers-4.10.1-041001-generic_4.10.1-041001.201702260735_amd64.deb
 
3.   linux-image-4.10.1-041001-generic_4.10.1-041001.201702260735_amd64.deb

After you've d/led them go to that folder (probably ~/Downloads) and enter:
    
    sudo dpkg -i *.deb

to install them. Then reboot. Confirm that you are running the new kernel with:

    uname -a </TEXT>

<TITLE> QS industry study - looking for recommendations </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-14 23:09:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm working with the [Human Data Commons Foundation](https://humandatacommons.org) in Vancouver, Canada and we are researching and writing a study which we are tentatively calling the **"Quantified Self Industry Report Card"** for presentation at the [Metric Culture conference in June](http://metriclife.net/whats-on/international-conference_-metric-culture-the-quantified-self-and-beyond/).

The description for our study that was accepted is as follows:

*"Who controls the data from Quantified Self apps? The data from Quantified Self apps creates a new layer of complexity around agency, ownership, privacy and security of personal data in a Big Data world. Growth of the QS industry and community invites a deeper conversation about ethics in data collection, use, disclosure, who has agency over it, and how its shared for personal, commercial, political, etc purposes. It further invites exploration of what kinds of policies and practices create the best use and least abuse of QS data. The Quantified Self Report Card provides an opening for this conversation as well as a baseline measure for current privacy and security policies among a range of QS product providers."*

<TEXT> I presume your wages are still denominated in CAD? If not then you definitely want to do that to help insulate you from volatility. 

I would ask for your invoices to be calculated in fiat using the 24hour sliding average figure on bitcoinaverage.com. Have the payment sent directly to your Quadriga account and then place orders. Follow the market (say with a widget in your phone) and with a little patience you will end up making more than you would with straight fiat payments.

Definitely get a h/w wallet (eg. Trezor) if you plan to store long term. You will have no problem sending the occasional 'savings deposit' from Quadriga to your Trezor.

<TEXT> I see Heidegger taking a sort of middle ground between a correspondence theory and a relativistic theory of truth.  It's relativistic in the sense that it only exists within a world view/language/culture, but it's also absolute in the sense that you can't get outside your culture's understanding of the way things are.  There's nothing sensible out there disconnected from our collective understanding.  Sort of like it would be relativistic, except there's nothing for it to be relative to.

<DATE> 2016-04-27 18:20:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm in the market for an upgrade and consider the current top contenders to be:

* http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/lenovo-unveils-thinkpad-x1-carbon-ultrabook-06-01-2014/
* http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/xps-13-linux/pd
* https://puri.sm/librem-13/

X1 Pros: Great backlit keyboard, fingerprint reader. X1 Cons: possibly backdoored by China.

XPS Pros: ships with Ubuntu. XPS Cons: reviews are less than stellar.

Librem Pros: hardware switch for video and mic, free and open philosophy, support an underdog. Librem Cons: no keyboard backlighting.

In any event I would be wiping the drive and installing Ubuntu 16.04. Help me decide between these or offer up a model I haven't considered! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tip: unscrew or change your fridge's light bulb to LED </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-04 18:45:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Perhaps this suggestion has already been suggested but here are the reasons why you want to do this:

* The vast majority of fridges more than 5 years old (ie. most) shipped with incandescent interior lightbulbs for lighting
* Incandescent lightbulbs are the least energy-efficient form of modern lighting common meaning they transform a large amount of the energy that they consume into heat (infra-red)
* Simply unscrewing the light-bulb will save you money in three important ways:

1. reducing the over-all energy that your fridge consumes solely from the lighting the bulb
2. reducing the the over-all energy that you fridge consumes by having to refrigerate the heat produced by the bulb
3. reducing the spoilage rate of food (esp. the top shelf, closest to the bulb)

We will see all of these benefits from changing to an higher-efficiency (and lower heat producing LED) bulb variant but just not to the same degree. </TEXT>

From that point forward as long as they are in contact with each other you don't have to do a screen unlock pattern or code on your phone. If they lost contact with each other you do.

That way if someone steals my phone they also have to take my watch for easy access. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All you really need is the gear (jacket, gloves, etc) to go with the bike. Even if you are in a place that gets a fair bit of snow you can still cycle - there are even studded winter tires for icy roads. You can also mount your bike on a trainer and ride inside. Lastly... autumn is a great time to buy a bike as stores are generally clearing out their stock and people are trading for winter sports gear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I can provide a 1 month update on the Zenphone 2. Picked one up to take traveling and 3 weeks into the trip the digitizer has gone intermittently flakey so words are frequently misspelled, icon presses don't always register the first time (and often not the third time), and if I test a finger on the screen the app will jump around (eg. maps). I've been an Asus fan for almost a decade, including all motherboards for servers, owned the first two transformers, several eeePCs, and several Zenbooks and I'm not that impressed with this phone. Plus they loaded it to the hilt with crappy unremovable (w/o rooting) bloatware.

<TEXT> Those aren't the routes you want to ride anyway. That's a common mistake made by people first switching from their car to a bicycle - they take the same route they would drive.

There are routes favoured by bicycles because they are safer - mostly fewer cars, wider shoulders and more other cyclists on them.  Google Maps is pretty good about showing these routes. You can also get good insight into them from [Strava's Global Heatmap](http://labs.strava.com/heatmap/#14/-123.09813/49.28487/blue/bike).

True that if you use Tor to reach the VPN then you are leaving an IP that isn't yours but you are still authenticating to use the VPN.

You can try setting up tor  vpn  tor but your latency is probably going to make it unusable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tried a few from different manufacturers before settling on AquaSpheres. I suggest spending some time in a shop that carries different makes and try some on. In my experience that ones that provide the best "suction" onto your face will be optimal. Everyone's face is different which is why it's kind of useless to ask for recommendations for specific manufacturers. Speedo Vanquisher were totally hopeless for me however they obviously work for others in here! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The best way to update the BIOS is to use unetbootln and create a FreeDOS boot disk (USB) and then copy the class file to it. Then boot into FreeDOS and run the flasher.

Or you can do it from Windows if you still have that around.

<TEXT> First install tor using [these instructions](https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en).

Then edit /etc/tor/torrc to set it as a relay.

Here's a sample for you:

    ## Configuration file for a typical Tor user
    ## Last updated 12 September 2012 for Tor 0.2.4.3-alpha.
    ## (may or may not work for much older or much newer versions of Tor.)
    ##
    ## Lines that begin with "## " try to explain what's going on. Lines
    ## that begin with just "#" are disabled commands: you can enable them
    ## by removing the "#" symbol.
    ##
    ## See 'man tor', or https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html,
    ## for more options you can use in this file.
    ##
    ## Tor will look for this file in various places based on your platform:
    ## https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#torrc
    
    ## Tor opens a socks proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
    ## configure one below. Set "SocksPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only
    ## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
    SocksPort 0 # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.
    #SocksPort 192.168.0.1:9100 # Bind to this address:port too.
    
    ## Entry policies to allow/deny SOCKS requests based on IP address.
    ## First entry that matches wins. If no SocksPolicy is set, we accept
    ## all (and only) requests that reach a SocksPort. Untrusted users who
    ## can access your SocksPort may be able to learn about the connections
    ## you make.
    #SocksPolicy accept 192.168.0.0/16
    #SocksPolicy reject *
    
    ## Logs go to stdout at level "notice" unless redirected by something
    ## else, like one of the below lines. You can have as many Log lines as
    ## you want.
    ##
    ## We advise using "notice" in most cases, since anything more verbose
    ## may provide sensitive information to an attacker who obtains the logs.
    ##
    ## Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to /var/log/tor/notices.log
    Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
    ## Send every possible message to /var/log/tor/debug.log
    #Log debug file /var/log/tor/debug.log
    ## Use the system log instead of Tor's logfiles
    #Log notice syslog
    ## To send all messages to stderr:
    #Log debug stderr
    
    ## Uncomment this to start the process in the background... or use
    ## --runasdaemon 1 on the command line. This is ignored on Windows;
    ## see the FAQ entry if you want Tor to run as an NT service.
    RunAsDaemon 1
    
    ## The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
    ## things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.
    DataDirectory /var/lib/tor
    
    ## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
    ## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.
    #ControlPort 9051
    ## If you enable the controlport, be sure to enable one of these
    ## authentication methods, to prevent attackers from accessing it.
    #HashedControlPassword ################################
    #CookieAuthentication 1
    
    ############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###
    
    ## Once you have configured a hidden service, you can look at the
    ## contents of the file ".../hidden_service/hostname" for the address
    ## to tell people.
    ##
    ## HiddenServicePort x y:z says to redirect requests on port x to the
    ## address y:z.
    
    #HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
    #HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
    
    #HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/other_hidden_service/
    #HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
    #HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
    
    ################ This section is just for relays #####################
    #
    ## See https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay for details.
    
    ## Required: what port to advertise for incoming Tor connections.
    ORPort 443
    ## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised in
    ## ORPort (e.g. to advertise 443 but bind to 9090), you can do it as
    ## follows.  You'll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding
    ## yourself to make this work.
    #ORPort 443 NoListen
    #ORPort 127.0.0.1:9090 NoAdvertise
    
    ## The IP address or full DNS name for incoming connections to your
    ## relay. Leave commented out and Tor will guess.
    #Address noname.example.com
    
    ## If you have multiple network interfaces, you can specify one for
    ## outgoing traffic to use.
    # OutboundBindAddress 10.0.0.5
    
    ## A handle for your relay, so people don't have to refer to it by key.
    Nickname giveagoodname
    
    ## Define these to limit how much relayed traffic you will allow. Your
    ## own traffic is still unthrottled. Note that RelayBandwidthRate must
    ## be at least 20 KB.
    ## Note that units for these config options are bytes per second, not bits
    ## per second, and that prefixes are binary prefixes, i.e. 2^10, 2^20, etc.
    RelayBandwidthRate 7500 KB  # Throttle traffic to 100KB/s (800Kbps)
    RelayBandwidthBurst 15000 KB # But allow bursts up to 200KB/s (1600Kbps)
    
    ## Use these to restrict the maximum traffic per day, week, or month.
    ## Note that this threshold applies separately to sent and received bytes,
    ## not to their sum: setting "4 GB" may allow up to 8 GB total before
    ## hibernating.
    ##
    ## Set a maximum of 4 gigabytes each way per period.
    #AccountingMax 4000 GB
    ## Each period starts daily at midnight (AccountingMax is per day)
    #AccountingStart day 00:00
    ## Each period starts on the 3rd of the month at 15:00 (AccountingMax
    ## is per month)
    #AccountingStart month 1 15:00
    
    ## Contact info to be published in the directory, so we can contact you
    ## if your relay is misconfigured or something else goes wrong. Google
    ## indexes this, so spammers might also collect it.
    ## You might also include your PGP or GPG fingerprint if you have one:

    ## For security, by default Tor rejects connections to private (local)

    ## Bridge relays (or "bridges") are Tor relays that aren't listed in the
    ## main directory. Since there is no complete public list of them, even an
    ## ISP that filters connections to all the known Tor relays probably
    ## won't be able to block all the bridges. Also, websites won't treat you
    ## differently because they won't know you're running Tor. If you can
    ## be a real relay, please do; but if not, be a bridge!
    #BridgeRelay 1
    ## By default, Tor will advertise your bridge to users through various
    ## mechanisms like https://bridges.torproject.org/. If you want to run
    ## a private bridge, for example because you'll give out your bridge
    ## address manually to your friends, uncomment this line:
    #PublishServerDescriptor 0

Lastly enter _sudo service tor restart_ to restart your relay with the new settings. Check here in a day or so and search for your node name to confirm it's all up and running and relaying traffic. Can also check the logs at /var/log/tor.

<TEXT> Decide whether you want traditional road bike style or commuter hybrid. I would go with that latter unless you are itching for the former - you'll find it a bit more comfortable with a more upright riding position. Then be sure you get a good fit. Lastly, don't blow all your budget on the bike - use some of it to harden it against theft (replace quick release wheel and seat skewers with something that requires special tools) and a good lock, a light set, rack and panniers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The capital gains are calculated at points in which conversion to/from fiat occurs.

For example I buy stocks valued at $10kCAD with bitcoin. Later I sell those stocks and receive $20kCAD worth of bitcoin. I'm pretty sure that the capital gain isn't realized until I covert back to fiat and would thereby defer the declaration until that time.

<TITLE> Adding "composite signatures" to Darkcoin for enhanced transaction privacy? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-02 21:11:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the 2014 edition of **Financial Cryptography and Data Security** the paper entitled ***"Increasing Anonymity in Bitcoin"*** (pg. 122-139) describes a technique called "*composite signatures*" that the authors claim would greatly increase the privacy of bitcoin transactions while adding very little bloat to the blockchain.

See: http://fc14.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/bitcoin14_submission_19.pdf

Since bitcoin is unlikely to add a privacy enhancement like this any time soon I'm curious if this community has considered this feature for darkcoin? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I use a KNC Jupiter Bitcoin miner to heat a 950 sqft apartment in Vancouver. With electricity costs of $0.09kw/h it generates revenue of approximately $2/day while keeping the place at a comfortable temperature and requiring no other heaters unless the outside temperature drops below -5C. And that's with 12ft floor to ceiling windows along the whole south side.
(Edit. Looks like you can buy them for about $100 on e-bay. Some minor computer knowledge required to set them up). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome to Vancouver! Unfortunately for you the [weather isn't supposed to be that great](http://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/bc-74_metric_e.html) :-(

However I would recommend going down to Denman   Georgia and renting a bike to ride the seawall around Stanley Park. Once you've done that you can decide whether you want to continue further. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For browsing, movies and music you should have no problems. Browsing will be a much safer experience. Movies = VLC. Music you will want to try a bunch before you settle on your favourite. I came from Winamp so landed with Audacious (which even allowed me to use my favourite Winamp skin). Spend some time learning the Linux file tree. It's very different than Windows but makes a whole lot more sense once you've been using it a while. Learn about hidden files/folders as that is where most of your settings are stored. Know that you can change **anything**. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of this is possible as part of the "pre-flight maintenance" while on the ground, no? Are there really still "strings" from the pilot area to the rudder trim anymore? Aren't all modern planes of this type now "fly by wire"? I happen to know someone who works as a sub-contractor for Boeing and he claims that they can log into the engines, while the plane is in flight, and make changes.

I'm genuinely just trying to understand what's possible... </TEXT>

<TITLE> Last day to respond to the province's transportation plan </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-11 23:27:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Provincial Government is current developing the plan, B.C. on the Move. Billions of dollars will be spent on this plan. Please take action to help ensure that cycling and walking get their fair share.

[Complete the Transportation Plan Survey] (http://surveys.givingopinions.ca/s/b637o/)

The deadline for your input is Dec. 12 at 4pm.

We strongly encourage the Province to implement a comprehensive Active Transportation Strategy building upon the BC Road Safety Strategy which commits to a long term goal of zero fatalities.  Safe and comfortable access for people walking, cycling, riding transit or using wheelchairs should be an integral part of the plan and of all the roads and bridges in BC.

By  donating http://bccc.bc.ca/donate  to the BCCC, you are supporting our efforts to make cycling safer and more comfortable for people of all ages and abilities across BC. Any  contribution http://bccc.bc.ca/donate  is much appreciated! Cycling facilities should be safe, convenient and comfortable for people of all ages and abilities including children and seniors. This includes bicycle paths and protected bike lanes that that are designed to be safe for the higher speed cycling required for long distance commuting, training and exercise.

Recommendations

- p. Accelerated provincial investment in walking and all ages and abilities cycling infrastructure totalling $100 million per year:
- p. Funding for auditing, planning and upgrading cycling and walking facilities on provincial roads and bridges including shoulders and separated paths;
- p. Increased Bike BC cost sharing funding to complete cycling networks in communities; 
- p. Cost sharing funding for complete streets with all ages cycling facilities that are also safer and more comfortable for walking; and
- p. Funding for trails and paths used by cycling and walking tourists and residents.
- p. Improved cycling and driver education;
- The adoption of improved standards for facilities that are both appropriate for all ages and abilities and higher-speed cycling;
- p. Universally available cycling skills training for children with provincial funding support;
- p. Improved standards more funding for maintenance and hazard removal on roads, shoulders paths used by cyclists;
- p. Legislation to improve the safety and legal protection of people walking and cycling including a safe passing distance (1m) law and allowing riding two abreast;
- p. Legislative changes allowing municipalities to cost-effectively reduce speeds on walking and cycling routes;
- p. The implementation of a comprehensive cycling tourism strategy; and
- Increased provincial funding for transit and legislation that gives municipalities and TransLink the authority to implement new funding sources for cycling, walking and transit improvements.
Take Action

<TEXT> One of the first [non-profit I worked with to implement it](http://peacegeeks.org/donate) has been accepting it for almost 2 years. They are even setup to give charitable tax receipts for it (if the donor provides their full information) - they just haven't updated their page to reflect it yet. I'm not aware of any feedback they have ever received to suggest that they shouldn't be accepting it. I also worked with [a local university](https://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/10/simon-fraser-university-campus-on-a-mission/) to accept it. Same thing. 

One other advantage to accepting bitcoin donations is because of its relative anonymity you are facilitating financial support from those may have a real need (or at least wish) to preserve their privacy. One example would be that resource-extraction employee or executive that secretly supports a [Greenpeace](http://greenpeaceblogs.org/2014/09/22/greenpeace-now-accepting-bitcoin-donations/)-style organization but doesn't want his/her support to be traced back such that s/he loses their job. Don't kid yourself - those kinds of double-agents are out there in droves and just need encouragement and the means!

The current state of cryptocurrency reminds me a lot of the early days of the web. I worked with a lot of non-profits in the early '90s to get them on the web and it was exactly the same thing. Some just couldn't see the future and didn't see why they should. Others were concerned that the internet was only used by drug dealers and child pornographers and they didn't want to be be associated with that. Well we know how that story played out. I feel crypto-currencies are currently at that same state that the web was in the mid-nineties. It's still very clunky to use but it behooves everyone to try and understand how it's going to affect them and the organizations they care about.

<TEXT> As a longtime member of both the bitcoin community and a technology consultant for non-profits I would say its (current) importance for non-profit organizations depends on what sort of work you do - in two different ways.

The first is if your work is in an area that overlaps with the core values of the bitcoin community - those of individual freedom, civil and human rights, open source technology, etc. If your organization works in those specific areas then the chances are that you can attract monetary support for your work in the form of bitcoin (and other similar currencies) especially if you commit to spending what you get back within the community (ie. purchasing needed services and goods from others that will take bitcoin).

Secondly there may be some advantage to adopting bitcoin if your organization has a need to make payments with leaving a smaller information fingerprint (eg. you have a strong desire from an operational security perspective not to have your payments traced - think Wikileaks or various human rights organizations). Also... if you work in international development and regularly send money overseas bitcoin can greatly expedite money transfers and reduce costs if you are properly setup on either end of the transfer.

<TEXT> I would recommend installing [Poweramp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxmpz.audioplayer) as her music player. It's a top-rated music app (the first app I ever paid for) and has a mono switch and L-R balance. This will allow you to route all sounds through both chanels (mono) and then set the balance to only output through the desired side. It actually won't matter if you don't change the balance except that you may save a little power by not driving both channels. The link above is to the trial version so you can confirm that it does what you are looking for. You get to the balance and mono switch through the little symbol comprised of 3 circles at the top-right . </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not a problem for you to be a reiki practitioner. It's just that they ask you to not do any other spiritual practises (including yoga, martial arts, etc.) during the retreat so that you can see the full effects of what you are being taught.

There were an few incidences about a decade ago of reiki practitioners experiencing psychotic episodes when they combined the two practices which led to this requirement for vipassana retreats.

Personally I always tell people that vipassana retreats are suitable for anyone who isn't at risk of a psychotic breakdown. Just be prepared to not practice any other disciplines for the 10 days of the retreat. It's not too much to ask. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nothing more than the fact that there are others that want them. All money is nothing but a story -- the more people who believe the story the more utility a currency has as a medium of exchange. 

To fully appreciate this watch the lectures for the course _[A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.coursera.org/course/humankind)_. Lesson #8 - _"The Direction of History"_ covers the history of barter and how we came to have and use the money that we do. The whole course is highly recommended.

I don't know how FFOS registers mime-types but clicking on BITCOIN:// URLs was a bust too. So... there is some progress but it needs some more work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I'm super bullish on bitcoin and have been since I came across it in 2010. I have a start-up that includes bitcoin support and have invested some of my bitcoin 'winnings' into other start-ups in the digital currency space.

Concerns around security and ease of use are being addressed rapidly (eg. Circle, BitPay, Coinbase, etc.)

I think the area that needs the most attention right now is the development of B2B services. The ball is already rolling nicely with retailers accepting it (eg. Dell, Cheapair, Expedia, Overstock, NewEgg, etc.) however each purchase made through those services results in downward pressure on the price of bitcoin since all of those are cashing out to fiat right away. 

The entrepreneurial space needs to begin focussing on developing services that encourage companies to hold bitcoin and to pay their employees and suppliers directly in bitcoin.

In case it's not obvious by now I am a digital currency 'true believer' - ie. I think that state-issued and controlled fiat is a lower rung on the evolutionary ladder of currency/payment technology. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a great converstation to be having. Now that B2C adoption is well underway entrepreneurs in this space should be starting to look at closing the loop so that bitcoins are held and used to pay suppliers rather than being immediately cashed out for fiat like most of the B2C adoptees are currently doing.

Maybe we could brainstorm a little here on ways to get current adoptees (seems one of the best places to start) to pursue this? </TEXT>

The only other item that comes to mind that you missed is a portable water filter.

<TEXT> Just keep going. The songs fading away (and they will) will be one of the things that will demonstrate progress.

Your sensations sound like you are at a good stage to begin the classic Vipassana technique of "body-scanning". To do this start at the crown of your head and slowly move your attention down through your body, missing nothing, noting the sensation that you are finding in each area and then move to the next body area. When you get to the tips of your toes start the other way moving back up towards your crown. Repeat!

It would be very helpful for you to take a 3 or 10 day course in this method to get you established and to interact with a teacher regarding any questions that arise for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely go for it. I sold my last car 20 years ago, switching to a bike and transit (on crappy days), and have never regretted that decision. Owning a car is such a hassle I never plan to own one again. In the meantime numerous alternatives have spring up for those times when you actually need one including car co-ops, Zip-Car, Car To Go, renting a car, etc. I'm a bit of an futurist and think that soon it won't be necessary as there will be fleets of driverless cars ready to take us wherever we want to go... but I still plan on riding my bike anyways. 

Finally, as a nod to /r/frugal, you can generally plan to save at least $1,000/month by not having a car. </TEXT>

Utility companies, shipping, packaging, manufacturing, lets get these people on board. Lets work on streamlining corporate account management, make it a no-brainer to use crypto instead of cheques or bank transfers.

This should be the next major focus for entrepreneurs wishing to contribute in the space.

<TEXT> If it's any help I just started using a Garmin 620 for running (beginner) and cycling  (intermediate). Here are some stats from the first of each:

First ride: 

 * Distance: 14.73 km
 * Time: 29.30
 * Calories: 265
 * Average heart rate: 132

First run:

 * Distance: 2.91 km
 * Time: 16:40
 * Calories: 221
 * Average heart rate: 162

So at least for me it looks like running works me almost twice as hard given the way I am approaching each activity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We camped near [the hoodoos](http://www.banff.com/banff-helpers/things-to-do-in-banff/hoodoos/) a couple of years ago. There used to be a large campground there but it was taken out by a forest fire about a decade ago. Just park and walk in. It's a bit eerie but there should be wild strawberries growing everywhere, fresh water from a lively stream, and no one else around. </TEXT>

Furthermore, can you please point me to a definitive, peer-reviewed study to show that expressing genes to produce more vitamin A won't also make it generate toxic byproducts for some other species? I pretty sure you can't for the simple reason that Vitamin A itself is almost certainly a toxic substance for some other living thing. Please note that I'm not against research into genetic engineering - that horse is well out of the barn. I'm merely opposed to a narrow, anthopocentric notion of "harmless". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't think of anyway around this unless you can figure out how to bypass the wifi captive portal. 

I think your best plan might be to get on the internet through an incognito session of your regular browser and then do some "typical browsing" (ie. a few recipe blogs, etc.)  while you fire up your secure browser and do what you want to do, keeping aware of shoulder surfers and video cameras!

If you dig around you may discover how to bypass the captive portal by making manual changes to your network settings after you've probed your surroundings. [This video shows one way to approach that](http://www.securitytube.net/video/4999). DDG around and you'll find others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's all quite doable in Drupal. You will find numerous approaches for the forums. I would stick with the Drupal core forums rather than integrating with a third party forum platform. Go with the votingapi module and those that use it for the voting part. For the wiki I would probably just use the markdown editor and turn on revision tracking for a custom content-type. Setting this up and configuring it should take only a day or so. Then you will want to start theming it. I would recommend starting with with Zen or Omega 4.

Good luck!

<TEXT>  One of the key features of bitcoin is that transactions dont require a third party to sign off, like a bank or a credit card company. Every time a credit card gets swiped, the issuer charges a small fee  typically around 3%. It doesnt sound like much but it quickly adds up and consumers ultimately end up paying.

But since bitcoin transactions dont require a third party, theres effectively no fee  a huge benefit to the economy.

Its also not controlled by any government or central bank. Bitcoin is part of a peer-to-peer software system. The amount in circulation is strictly controlled by an algorithm. That means it cannot be incorporated into any countrys monetary policy and new bitcoins cant be created at the whim of central bankers.

<TEXT> I saw a presentation 4 or 5 years ago that purported to answer this question for Drupal 6. The answer at that time was $6 million - based upon something called the "constructive cost model" - which purports to be a standard way of costing coding. It is just based upon the number of lines of code and how long it would take a competent coder to build, test and debug that codebase. I believe you can easily apply the same model to Drupal 8 - perhaps even as simply as multiplying by the differential in the codebase size and adjusting for inflation.

Interesting aside - the presenter also mentioned that the stable version of Debian would cost $4 billion at that time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I last used Windows in 2000. I had built a web hosting and development business in the 90s on Microsoft. When I sold it at the end of '99 part of the reason was that I was fed up with Microsoft's licensing regime. I switched to Apple for front end dev and Debian for hosting. It wasn't long afterwards that I dropped Apple altogether and have been fully open source ever since. I switched my workstations from Debian to Ubuntu on Breezy (5.04) and my servers over on 8.04 and have never looked back. On the home front I have three laptops, my wife's  workstation, a media server, and a development server in our condo all running Ubuntu. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Here's the view I would use](http://vancouver.en.craigslist.ca/search/bik?zoomToPosting= catAbb=bik query= minAsk= maxAsk=500 excats=). As you can see there are lots to choose from in your price range. I put in a max price of $500 because you might be able to make an offer on something slightly above your price range or stretch your budget a little further if you really think you've "found the one for you". 

Since you aren't going to be getting the latest, greatest with your budget I would look for one that:

1. fits and that you will ride. You probably want to be looking in the 54cm range.

2. seems well-maintained and ridden OR one of those "I'm cleaning out my garage and noticed this which I hadn't ridden in years" deals.

4. ignore fixies. You will see a lot of them and there's a reason that they are all for sale. 

Take a test ride and don't worry too much about how comfortable the saddle is, how smoothly it shifts or if the brakes squeal - you can deal with those on your own time. More important to make sure that the frame is solid and true and that nothing is badly rusted or bolts are stripped. 

Now is a really good time to be buying a road bike, imho - before the rain ends, spring arrives and more people think about digging their bikes out.
Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cruise Craigslist's bikes-for-sale-by-owner a lot and IMHO you can score some great deals if you know your way around. How tall are you and what's your budget because I was looking just yesterday and there seem to be an enormous amount of road bikes at the present time which should help you?

I wouldn't take too much stock from the prices listed on other forums. Much depends on the condition of the bike and what the local market is like. Often the forums are referring to places in the States that simply have a better market. </TEXT>

2) Yes, traffic shaping is a harsh reality. Go with [Novus](http://novusnow.ca) if you can, otherwise a Shaw reseller like [Teksavvy](http://teksavvy.com) or [Lightspeed](http://www.lightspeed.ca), although they both seem to be affected by Shaw's upstream shaping. If the latter, save yourself some money by picking up a second-hand cable modem from [FreeGeek](http://freegeekvancouver.org) for about $15 rather than renting (rip-off) or buying new.

3). I'm self-employed in the tech sector and there still seems to be no shortage of work. </TEXT>

If I'm not happy with that one I will increase it one more stop. The only other factor is holding the phone very steady while it takes all the shots that will be used for your final image.

I suggest 2 things: one get a designer involved in your site to prevent it from looking like it was cobbled together from clip-art icons barfed onto a generic web template. The second is to check and curate the links and services in your directory. It just makes you look really lame when the first link I follow is dead.

I know this is a bit harsh but you really need to up your game! </TEXT>

That combined with today's announcement of interest being paid on deposits I HIGHLY recommend that you reconsider using vircurex.com.

This behaviour is highly consistent with the final grab before wrapping up and absconding with the funds.

It's too bad because it has been an upstanding service up until this point.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We want this sub-reddit's banner to reflect the wishes of its members as much as you do.

Please submit your original (sorry /u/donovanbailey ;-) art and designs via a comment below.

We've included some of the current banners below so that they can be included in the voting.

Please don't use pictures, logos or graphics from other sources as these won't fly.

All submissions must come with three items:

1. An /r/vancouver logo (preferably vector), 
2. an /r/vancouver banner (_.png_ or _.jpg_) and, 
3. a mocked up screenshot showing how it would all look together.

The contest will run for 30 days after which the most popular qualifying design will be incorporated into the design files for this sub-reddit.

_Inspiration for this comes in part from /r/bicyling which holds a [successful kit design contest](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/o3lki/2012_reddit_jersey_pricing_and_ordering_info/) every year._ </TEXT>

<TEXT> A simple app to show the closest Bitcoin-accepting locations as pulled from [CoinMap](http://coinmap.org). I'm willing to donate 1BTC to the developer of a successfully working Android app that includes the ability to filter the list by type of establishment (eg. cafe, restaurant, etc.)

_Edit: the app must be open source and available for download in the Google Play Store and [F-Droid](http://f-droid.org) repository._

<TITLE> How litecoin can extend its lead on the other alt-coins </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-05-24 01:28:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From where I sit litecoin has a comfortable hold on second spot in the alt-coin space. 

In my view what would really help extend this lead is being first to add support for the zerocoin protocol.

Bitcoin is now too big and cautious to be first with this. In addition it would bloat the blockchain even more at a time when managing blockchain size and dust transactions are already taking a significant portion of development efforts.

Litecoin is presently in the fortunate position of having enough uptake and mindshare to be important but there still being relatively little real world implications of relatively major changes to its protocol.
My prediction is that the current relevant alt-chains to add zerocoin support will get a significant boost in popularity and uptake. 

It should be litecoin.

<TITLE> If I suddenly had 1MBTC here's what I would do... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-02-18 19:05:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last week someone started a thread discussing what would be done if one suddenly had 1,000,000BTC.

_Here's what I would do:_

First I would stick 5KBTC in a cold wallet for my retirement. 

Second I would convert 5KBTC to fiat so that I could step back from my job and concentrate on the project below.

With the remaining 990KBTC I would do the setup a bitcoin incubator/foundation that would give grants of up to 1KBTC for projects that met the following criteria:

**1) That they further the bitcoin economy (the grant could not be immediately converted to fiat);**

**2) That they support the goals of lessening inequality and increasing peace, human rights, and government and corporate accountability.**

I would create a braintrust of bitcoin e-commerce experts to help mentor the grant-winning projects. All of this would be managed through a website that would provide complete transparency into the granting process as well and show the flow of transactions from all grants.

So... if you have a bunch of spare BTC and think this is a good idea, get in touch! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ubuntu (Phone) App store to accept bitcoin? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-02-18 17:40:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few days ago I started a thread about how to get the Ubuntu App store to accept bitcoin. I noted that the first Ubuntu Phone images will be released this week and that it will not launch with an App store and thus there seems time to integrate bitcoin payments into their final release version.

History shows that good ideas usually happen in parallel and it turns out that [someone had brought this idea to Mark Shuttleworth's attention the previous day to which he had replied _"It's a super suggestion, thank you"_!](http://i.imgur.com/JGmdT72.jpg)

It seems to me this is could be a great differentiator for Ubuntu Phone, as well as being a great encouragement for app developers (why not give them the choice of accepting payments in bitcoin - or a mix of bitcoin and fiat?)

If Ubuntu Phone is serious about making serious inroads into the developing world then this payment option makes perfect sense - transaction fees are low to non-existent and micropayments are possible down to 0.000000001BTC ($0.000000265USD). </TEXT>

They've already announced that the first release will not include an app store.

<TEXT> As the title suggests I'm looking for recommendations for pay-as-you-go US service for my GSM Galaxy Nexus making occasional day and multi-day trips into the US from Canada.

I would prefer to purchase a single SIM card and top it up with some access when I cross the line. Hoping for decent coverage in Washington and Oregon.

<TEXT> I've spotted [this setup](http://imgur.com/iVUq6) twice outside my place in the past week. There are no obvious logos to tell who owns it. The camera swivels in all directions and seems to look in several directions without any discernable pattern. It doesn't seem to be common movie industry gear (common here). Both times it's been accompanied/followed by a member of the VPD. It moves a random distance and then stops while the camera swivels in a bunch of directions, then moves on.  </TEXT>

It was photographed in remote terrain in the interior of British Columbia about a month ago. It was on a tall tower (60 ' tall or more). The tower had a fence locked with a barrel, tank, solar panels, some coffee can shaped thing battery back up, and control box with plug in, probably for a laptop.

Any ideas? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2010-08-29 18:26:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm running a Ubuntu Linux media server that outputs audio through USB to a Behringer UCA202 external DAC and then from there to a NAD L-40 receiver which power a pair of Mission 710 speakers. The whole setup is on a metal rack that is on wheels making it easy to re-position. 

http://virishi.net/sites/default/files/media-setup.jpg

My sources files are mostly jazz FLACs, some that have been ripped by audiophiles from their vinyl, and I use XMMS as my player. I use VLC for watching videos.

Could you help me identify the weakest links in my setup and suggest upgrades that would provide me with the biggest 'bang for the buck'? The only thing off the table is changing the OS of the server as I'm an open source advocate and Ubuntu supporter. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've working on a project here on the coast of BC involving collecting a lot of field data (ecological and cultural) and I would love to put Android devices into the hands of participants. However there is a requirement for a device that can take a beating and is waterproof. I just spent some time in the field and can't quite see a Nexus One, etc. surviving for long.

I've been pointed at a similar project running under WinMo - a road I'd much rather not go down. However they at least have the option of toughened units by Trimble and others. See http://www.cybertracker.org/index.html 

Does anyone here have any leads on similar hardware running Android? </TEXT>
