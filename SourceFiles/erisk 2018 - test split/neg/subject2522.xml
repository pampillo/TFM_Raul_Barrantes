<TEXT> You are making some very dangerous assumptions in the way you think scientists should communicate. The level of discourse at which scientists should communicate with the lay public is not the same at which they communicate with each other. You are also conflating this with the education of children which is an entirely different level of discourse apart from scientists communicating with each other and communicating with the lay public. 

The level of discourse you are advocating is what leads the public to ideas like, "Evolution is *ONLY* a theory!" The way we as scientists communicate with the public shouldn't be explaining that alternatives exist and this may be wrong but it is the best answer we have. Rather we should speak in the affirmative. Explain the evidence and how it connects together for us to form the fact we then communicate as a theory. THAT is how you communicate with the public without confusing issues and creating more problems. You can't expect the lay public to be able to think as critically about problem and that's fine! That's why we pay people to do it full time! We need to show people that they hire scientists to think about problems and engineers to solve it just like someone hires an electrician or plumber to fix something in their home.

We need to learn that we cannot treat the lay public as content equals but we also cannot talk down to them. We have to be able to talk science like Bob Ross talks painting. That's the only way to rebuild the trust between the public and scientific experts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The French election is not an outlier but the culmination of right-wing populist loses in Europe. First, Norbert Hofer lost in Austria then Geert Wilders lost in the Netherlands. This also isn't the first time a National Front candidate has contested the second round of the French presidential election. Jean-Marie La Pen ran in 2002 and lost. Though the loss was greater then because the parties united against La Pen. This year the lower turnout can be partially credited to the main Left candidate Jean-Luc Mlenchon not supporting Macron which probably meant his supporters didn't go out and vote. 

Macron has five years to produce some growth and this election has certainly given him a mandate. Now, his ability to carry out the mandate will depend on how En Marche and the Socialists (he served as Minister of Finance in a Socialist government) do in the June parliamentary elections. There will be a lot of momentum after June (both the French and German elections) for some major reform of the French economy and the EU.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Employees still have to follow the polices of their employer regardless of whether they are on duty or not. Free speech protections don't nullify company (and in this case police department) policies. 

For example, I'm a scientist. All work I come up with on company time belongs to the company. All information that a police officer obtains in the official line of duty is protected information. Something and ordinary citizen would not have access too. 

I challenge you to find one source that nullifies company policy by citing free speech protections.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Homeless people can't vote because they can't prove residency. Regardless of voter ID laws this has always been a restriction and a rather necessary one. Precinct level voting is where you record whether someone has voted. You can't vote in another precinct and you can't vote in a precinct more than once since you have to sign the voter roll book. In Ohio, you are required to show proof of residency (which is why passports and birth certificates aren't accepted but utility bills are) you then sign the book and your signature is compared to the one on file, then you are given a ballot and the ballot number (which is removed before you get the ballot) is recorded alongside your name. [Source](http://boe.cuyahogacounty.us/pdf_boe/en-US/pollworkers/2016/PEOHandbook09132016.pdf)  
So if you can't prove you are part of a community why should you be able to vote in said community? 

Photo ID laws are honestly not what disenfranchises people the most. It is actually going to vote which takes time and when you are low income you have very little time to spare to exercise your franchise. So rather than waste energy on opposing voter ID laws, there should be a greater effort to provide more options and time to vote. Absentee ballots are honestly the best way to do it, but varies wildly from state to state. For example, in Pennsylvania you have to submit a request that cites one of the few valid statutory reasons, along with proof, to obtain an absentee ballot. Right next door in Ohio, absentee ballots request forms are automatically sent to every registered voter in the state and the only requirement to get one is you wanting one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Process of Impeachment7 Steps
        
I. Impeachment
         A. Being formally accused of unlawful activity, committing a crime
         B. Not necessarily being kicked out of office
        
II. Who can be Impeached?  Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution
         A. President, Vice-President, and all civil officers of the United States
         B. Civil Officers include people appointed by the President (cabinet
              members and judges)
         C. Members of Congress are NOT civil officers
 
III. Process of Impeachment
         A. 7 Steps of Impeachment:
                  1.  Justice Department or an independent council investigates charges   presents them to the House Judiciary Committee
 
                  2. House Judiciary Committee (HJC) reviews evidence
 
                  3. HJC drafts Articles of Impeachment
 
                  4. HJC debates Articles of Impeachment (Nixon)
 
                  5.  Entire House of Representatives debates Articles of Impeachment   votes on them (Simple Majority)
                           a. If this happens, President is considered Impeached
 
                  6.  Senate holds the Trial "Will the official be kicked out of office"
                           a. House Judiciary Committee acts as the prosecution-- presents evidence against the accused
                           b. Accused chooses own lawyers to present defense
                           c. Chief Justice of Supreme Court acts as Judge and rules on admissibility of evidence
                           d. Senate acts as the Jury
 
                  7. A 2/3 majority of the Senate must vote against accused to remove the person from office (Andrew Johnson, Clinton)

<TEXT> The 25th amendment provides a way to remove Trump from office. 

Section 1. In case of the removal of thePresidentfrom office or of his death or resignation, theVice Presidentshall become President.

Section 2. Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses ofCongress.

Section 3. Whenever the President transmits to thePresident pro tempore of the Senateand theSpeaker of the House of Representativeshis written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President asActing President.

Section 4. Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.

Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.

<TEXT> You do know what the Russians did is exactly what Nixon tried to do in the Watergate scandal, right? Honest private communications on political strategy will always be compromising. They talk about how to build a message, how to formulate attacks and defenses, and speak openly about their allies and opponents. That's like stealing the war plans of your enemies. It gives an overwhelming advantage to your side because you know what they will be doing and why. It has also been proven that the Russians fed the documents to WikiLeaks because they know how much Assange hates Clinton and Obama.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A bit of advice, never use a video/documentary to prove a point. They are highly manipulative and difficult to fact check. Audiovisual media speaks to people emotionally allowing the creator to bypass our logical skepticism. Flat out, if you want to be respected by intelligent people use written sources. 

You seem not to understand fiat currency or why it is important and how it helps debtors while things like the gold standard helps creditors. That is where the whole fight between the gold standard and silver standard came from. Silver prices inflate faster (it is even easier to control inflation with fiat currency) than gold making debt worth less over time compared to the equivalent debt in a gold backed system. [[1](http://projects.vassar.edu/1896/currency.html)] 

It would be incredibly unwise for the Federal Reserve to become a consumer lender in the way you argue. You don't want the government making day to day decisions on peoples lives. That would be socialism and the weakness there is its susceptibility to political decision making  over business/market decision making. The Federal Reserve sets the rates at which it lends to banks to control macroeconomic factors such as inflation. Lower interest rates promote inflation while high rates decrease inflation. Some inflation is good because it lowers the cost of borrowing which promotes growth. This means some inflation is good for small business while it eats into the profit margins of big banks. [[2](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-30778491)]

Quantitative easing is another way to control inflation. Essentially it is the Federal Reserve increasing the money supply which then increases inflation because if the whole of the collection of dollars has some value increasing its number of subdivisions decreases the value of an individual dollar. [[3](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-5)]

Currency value in comparison to the currency of other nations is a different story. A relatively weak currency is good for an export driven economy since it lowers the price of goods in other countries thereby increasing demand. A strong currency on the other hand promotes the demand for imports since the cost of foreign goods goes down relative to domestic goods. For a heavily consumer based and service driven economy this is a better situation. This is actually one of the major problems with the Eurozone currency. Germany is an export driven economy which is propped up by an undervalued Euro compared to what the Deutschmark would be valued at. [[4](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bobmcteer/2015/01/24/is-a-strong-dollar-a-good-thing-or-a-bad-thing/#21ae510c6b61)][5 ([right-leaning source](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/07/22/how-does-euro-membership-help-germany/); [left-leaning source](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2015/04/03/germanys-trade-surplus-is-a-problem/)]

Many of your viewpoints were that of the Federal Reserve in the 1920's and 1930's, i.e. limiting the money supply. That policy is what converted the 1929 recession into the Great Depression that would last until 1939. So yes the Federal Reserve is to blame, but it isn't the mere existence of the institution that caused it. It was the culmination of bad policy. Even Bernake agrees the Federal Reserve is to blame for the Great Depression, but it acted exactly the opposite way the Federal Reserve did in response to our most recent crisis. [[6](http://www.wnd.com/2008/03/59405/)]

So in summary the Federal Reserve is only as good as the policy decisions it makes, but it needs to exist to be able to make that policy. Here is some good reading on the relationship between Andrew Jackson shutting down the Federal Reserve and the economic crisis that followed.

<TEXT>   the ACA to remain, then it is a tax imposed on the populace

Uhhh....yeah...don't you remember the Supreme Court decision that said as much in [NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 
 BUSINESS ET AL. v. SEBELIUS, SECRETARY OF 
 HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, ET AL.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html)


Health care isn't something markets can deal with efficiently. The free market isn't always perfect there are natural inefficiencies in it with health care, prisons, and the labor market as prime examples. Health care costs only decrease when spread out across a large number of healthy people in addition to sick people. That is the fundamentals of how insurance works, spreading risk out. It isn't access if it is so unaffordable that people won't go when they should. That results in health problems getting worse and more expensive to treat than they would otherwise be. 

The most efficient model for reducing health care costs is a single payer system plain and simple. Anything else breaks down the market and you get skyrocketing prices like in the ACA markets. The whole healthcare system is fucked up and it boils down to the shady relationship between healthcare providers and insurers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem I have with this statistic is that it neglects the fact the millennial generation is currently the largest age group in the country which also coincides with record high higher education enrollment rates. So of course the participation rate will seem low because students aren't counted as participating in the labor force but are counted as part of the adult population. Also, a lot of people under 64 retired early because of the recession. Once these effects get watered down over the next 5 - 10 years, I think you will see a rise in the participation rate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh they were taught the difference between fact and opinion. The problem is that opinions where always led with easily recognizable qualifier such as "I believe" or "I think." So all Trump and his ilk have to do is start their lies with I believe and their followers let him off scott free when it turns out he was just lying.

<TEXT> Okay, I'm working through some comments and I'll reply to some here.

**On the topic of abortion** I agree with you on the viability part but that is not in dispute, it is actually the foundation of the limitations on Roe v. Wade. The argument anti-abortion advocates and especially activists use is that life begins at conception which is a belief founded in the Christian faith not medical science. This is a religious debate not a political conservative debate. The reason being that the states that have legislation restricting abortions or adding steps to the process are stepping into and dictating the patient-doctor relationship. This goes against one of the very core tenants of what it means to be a conservative and a Republican...the support of a small non-intrusive government. 
Once an honest man could go from sunrise to its set 
Without encountering agents of his state or government 
But a sorry cloud of tyranny has fallen across the land 
Brought on by hollow men, who did not understand 
That for centuries our forefather have fought and often died 
To keep themselves unto themselves, to fight the rising tide 
And that if in the smallest battles we surrender to the state 
We enter in a darkness whence we never shall escape

One of my favorite quotes on this point from the song Sons of Liberty.          

I also find it very hypocritical of the Republican Party to push legislation of this type. Legislation regulating admitting privelages are also completely trumped up. Abortions are *incredibly* safe for the woman. These restrictions are very obviously made to limit access to legal abortions. The only way to claim otherwise would have been to add these same regulations to a whole host of *actually* dangerous outpatient procedures like [hysterectomies.](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/11/is-outpatient-surgery-safe/index.htm) Recently and currently, Republicans have been pushing moral restrictions on a whole host of women's medical issues, mostly centered around family planning. But, when it comes to corporations they say (1) corporations are people and (2) corporations can be trusted to act morally and responsibly so the need for regulations is purely onerous bureaucracy. What I don't get is why religious Republicans can't trust women to act morally while they believe they can trust corporations to do the same. Regardless of my stance on the issue of abortion any further restrictions are purely moral that must be fought for in the civic sphere not by using the government to force a belief on to others. 

If you don't want abortions provide *real* sex education not abstinence only bullshit. That's how teenagers get pregnant. Provide more funding to Planned Parenthood to provide cheap or free contraceptives and education to poor and underprivileged woman. If you don't like PP because they also happen to provide abortion services as well fund an organization that does everything PP does minus that. 

**Freedom of Speech** Based on what I saw you saying I wanted to discuss this a little bit. The 1st Amendment states 
 Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech...

This right is purely in the context of the government. Civil society may react to what you say however people please. They may disagree with you, private citizens and companies have the right to suppress your voice, and also say whatever they want back to you. It is your right to say something. It is not your right to make people listen to you or give you a platform for you speech.  It is just as much someones right to tell you to shut up as it is for you to say whatever you want.

**LGBT Issues**
This is another issue that is purely religious founded in Abrahamic beliefs. Anti-LGBT views are in no way those of the political conservative. This is another example of the Republicans pushing big government. The true conservative recognizes that the potential of a nation can only be reached when all of its citizens have the equal opportunity to achieve success. It promotes the most efficient economy by promoting an efficient workforce. Many of these religious liberty laws are just the institutionalization of discrimination. Now I'm not saying you can't discriminate  against someone, it is your right to do so. You just have to discriminate against a person because of who they are not what they are. Who describes an individual, what describes a group membership inherent from birth. Trump himself isn't anti-LGBT because he recognizes that position is also anti-business. However, *every single* nominee to his cabinet (including his VP, CoS, and Chief Strategist) hold some degree of anti-LGBT views. Every single LGBT friend I have is scared for their future now because of it. 


That's all I really had time to get through, but I hope to hear your thoughts!

<TEXT> Okay, lets take a look and unpack the slander you have unleashed on me personally, gussied up in the guise of "sources."

Absolute numbers are a piss poor way to analyze data between two extremely different groups. It needs normalized to make apples to apples comparison. Any competent scientist can tell you that. So once you can support your claims in terms of lobbying expenditures as a percentage of revenue there is no solid conclusions that can be drawn. Obviously those with the most money have a greater capacity to fund lobbying. Why wouldn't they? What's better for you as an individual a class-action lawsuit or an individual lawsuit? 

Your second point has nothing to do with equality. You are losing yourself in your own biases. Corporations seek to protect their interests. Why shouldn't they? Business do not have representation in Congress. Businesses do not get to vote. The only way a business can serve its interests in the public sphere is by lobbying.

 the government (controlled by lobbyists of the rich)

It is truly rich that you still do not understand the problem of this statement. I'm not going to argue with you that lobbyists influence the government. That is the entire point of the industry! No one group **controls** the government. So like I said before. None of your sources back up your claims like you think they do. They just reaffirm your biases.

<TEXT> Well, the Economist has always been a liberal political paper. There are a few things that go with that perspective you need to keep in mind with a couple of the biggest being a strong disdain for populism and nationalism. If you look at their coverage through that lens it makes a lot more sense. They also generally support the status quo and gradual change in the tradition of English conservatism. I don't think anyone has ever tried to claim the Economist was unbiased. It is just that the biases it does express are very much in line with Western values and globalism. 

Now to claim they lack facts in their coverage is an insult to their integrity if you do not have evidence to back it up. Regardless of their political bent, they will not make things up. Their reputation is far too important for that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It's not about intentions - it's about possibilities.

I think people have a tendency to forget this. Intentions change much more rapidly than possibilities. Intentions are good enough when countries share values or when one has a history of being a satellite state. The Russian-American relationship does not fit into either of these categories. Couple this with the history of Russia being absolutely pummeled in multiple wars and Russian actions make a lot of sense.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really think it is an excess of the system or even a problem the system itself. The world is going through a technological revolution that is fundamentally altering the way the global economy functions and how it produces wealth. We cannot expect our leaders and policy makers to make informed decisions when no one really knows what is going on. 

That is also the source of the extreme partisanship in the United States. Prior to Reagan, Republicans and Democrats generally agreed to what the economic problems were, but disagreed on how to approach them. What we have now is two parties that cannot even agree on what the problem is to be able to reach a compromise solution. 

When we cannot be certain of what action to take it comes down to political preference which can be arbitrary. 

Once the digital revolution starts to slow down and we understand better only then is it possible to make informed choices on economic and labor management.  </TEXT>

Fact and opinion can always be separated regardless of modifiers like "I believe" in front of demonstratively false information. A better comparison is like saying I believe the sky is yellow. Well, no, it's not. There is proof to the contrary. The point being that the sky being yellow is not an opinion, it's just called being wrong.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not how this works at all. There are a few different routes a company can take. (1) Don't give your current employees a raise, but hire more staff to prevent employees from needing to work overtime [great for improving employment rate] (2) Don't hire more staff, allow overtime for your employees [increases worker wages but gives company more payroll flexibility] (3) increase the salary of midlevel employees to the new minimum and shift some of the low level work load to them [increase of payroll but easier logistics] (4) some combination of the above. As a scientist this raise would be great because now all post-doc position will be required to pay a minimum of $47,476 which should result in more high quality candidates pursuing a post-doc instead of going straight to industry.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I find funny about this whole argument is it makes it out to be some vast conspiracy from Hillary like she was hiding a shadow government or something. That is a total load of poppycock. She is just an old woman that had absolutely no idea how to use a desktop computer and didn't want to put in the effort to learn how. It was incompetence and nothing more. We all know now the right has absolutely no qualms with incompetence as evidenced by the election of Trump.

The Republicans have many  more tactics than literacy tests and poll taxes to suppress the vote. Rather than increase minority  outreach, they choose to make it harder to vote.

<TEXT> The world is certainly not awful. 

(1) Accusations against Russia. Of course Russia should be called out and be attacked in return. Anything less is weakness and cowardice that will diminish US standing on the world stage. If we can't even defend ourselves against a state as weak as Russia, what would that make China think, let alone the rest of the world? In your view we should just let other nations walk all over US interests and oh yeah its cool if they interfere with our domestic politics too.

(2)No fly zone. This is a test of wills and about increasing the costs of Russian involvement. Nothing going on the in the world happens in a vacuum. Everything is related. EVERYTHING. US actions in Syria have numerous aims. One is to end the humanitarian crisis to alleviate the flow of refugees into Europe. The other is to make it painfully costly for Russia to remain involved in Syria. They are taking a lot more risk and have a lot more to lose. Part of this reasoning is pay back for previous US failings, such as Georgia and Ukraine. We can't punish them there, but in Syria we have that opportunity. Pushing the no fly zone is like playing a game of chicken. First one to pull back loses. This is exactly what the Cuban Missile Crisis was. Russian geopolitics have always been rather masculine and chauvinistic. Each action Putin takes serves as a test for how much farther he can go next time. Blink and we fall down.

(3) No one ever wants to go to war. That is just putting all of your fear and hatred into a person to accuse someone of that.

(4) What has she been lying about in the context of what you are talking about? You are not making sense. 

(5) Uranium. So now there was no Obama in the White House? Clinton completely ran all foreign policy and national security decisions? There is no NSC? You have no idea how these decisions are made. They are collective with the final sign off by the president. Especially, something as sensitive as this. 

(6) Assad. The Assad regime is dead regardless. Syria is destroyed and will never recover to what it was. Assad has no legitimacy to govern outside his narrow coastal holdings. I'm not arguing for the toppling of Assad, but the only viable solution I see is the Balkanization of Syria, where Assad can remain in power in the coastal territories where he still has support.

Get your head out of your ass and try to understand how the world works and how our government makes decisions instead of making Clinton out to be some evil boogeyman.  </TEXT>

Racism is offensive. You feel offended when people are racist. That is exactly what happened here. Just because racism isn't as openly hateful and vitriolic as during the civil rights movement doesn't mean it isn't happening. Racism takes a much more nuanced tone these days so people can sweep it under the rug.

I also don't think there are enough 'crazy' Trump supporters to cause anything too bad. It will be important to watch the statements that come out of the Republican Party post-election to see if they plan on adjusting their message or platform. 2018 will be a big turning point.

<TEXT> I agree, but it is just the start of shifting the message of the Democratic party. If that shift takes places and Democrats can keep posting wins that means this country's political center has moved left. Which helps more candidates like Sanders win seats. If the Dems shift left and start losing elections again they are in the position they were in before Bill Clinton whole helped move the Democratic Party to the right and closer to the political center. Clinton is going to have to compromise quite a bit to move things left. As long as the left wing Dems are willing to play the long game they can be successful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think there is anything he could get from China. China is pushing bilateral talks because they have all the cards then. Think of it like the relationship between managers and workers. Managers have all the cards and can control their workers individually, but through collective action workers gain a stronger hand and can actually gain concessions from the managers. This was not a smart move on Duterte's part. The US cannot acquiesce without looking very week and setting a terrible precedent for other weak allies, such as Pakistan. If Duterte knew what he was doing he would have threatened these actions in back channels and slowly pulled them out one by one to show he is serious. Playing all your cards at once is foolish. By pulling out of all military relationships with the US, he no longer has any negotiating room with China.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never said I looked with particular depth, but thank you for sharing that with me. It is a great example of the disconnect between how we identify ourselves and how others try to identify us. You understand how frustrating it can be. I wholeheartedly agree with you about the military. 

I never said I support separating communities and I never would. But the fact is communities are separated and we must understand why. Only then will the barriers start to break down. 

The only way we do that is through our public institutions. The military is a great example of this working but very few Americans will join the military. Our public schools used to be the great equalizer. They were responsible for uniting all the various European immigrants and instilling American values in a new generation. It wasn't long ago when Irish, Italian, and other Catholic immigrants were discriminated against. But our schools forced the children to see eachother as peers, as equals.  However, education funding has been withering. This is causing significant segregation of children into private charter schools. Not giving parents a choice forces students to interact with people they might not otherwise. This is one reason I am very against homeschooling. Primary and secondary school is as much about the information you learn as it is about social interactions. We just need to fund our schools better, pay our teachers more to attract better talent, and provide strong support for students whose home environment isn't academically supportive. 

Ben Carson is a great example of what the American Dream is about, but it was because his mother emphasized education so much.  We shouldn't punish children whose parents don't value education. Public education should be about preparing students to succeed in any opportunity they choose, regardless of their socioeconomic background and their home environment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It won't do anyone any good by being insulting. Doing so neglects the content of the argument and shuts down dialogue.

What I am saying is if you are refusing to engage and understand the perspective of others you are more detrimental to the discussion than anything. I can feel the emotion in your words and you need to be able to set that aside. You so far have refused to actually engage and that is really trying my patience. 

I teach a faculty certification course. Essentially, it is a course that teaches PhD students and post-docs how to teach, such as design a syllabus, write a lesson plan, and foster a strong learning environment. Things that a professor rarely learns before they are thrown into teaching. Social justice is important and using it in a derogatory manner doesn't help make your point in any way whatsoever. It is important for a teacher to understand the diversity of the students they will be teaching to foster an engaging learning environment. This covers a range of topics from the concerns of international students to the LGBT community, to students with learning or physical disabilities. It is about balancing accommodation and assimilation. Why should we force everyone to assimilate? We can all be equal without being the same. We just need to understand and respect each other and our differences. 

When teaching international students you need to be cognizant of your vocabulary, the rate of which you speak, and your use of idioms. Americans love idioms, but their meaning is cultural bound. An international student can have great command of the language without the cultural context. This is like not being able to understand British slang. Being aware of these also helps students with processing disabilities. These people are just as smart, it just takes them a little longer to make the same conclusions or process what has been said. 

It is also important to be aware of other disadvantaged communities. Frequently, we find black students do not feel a part of the campus community in the same way white students do. In fact, many minority communities feel this way. One reason is something called microagressions. These are seemingly innocuous statements that actually challenge a persons sense of self. One example would be asking an Asian-American where they are *really* from after they tell you they are from Kentucky. Because I think it helps here are a few more visual examples. [\[1\]](http://i.imgur.com/K8lJwQK.jpg)[\[2\]](http://i.imgur.com/Sa3AWKl.jpg)[\[3\]](http://i.imgur.com/LnZ2tOm.jpg)[\[4\]](http://i.imgur.com/pqlYgNr.jpg)[\[5\]](http://i.imgur.com/CBXJwh8.png) This is important because when we enter a new situation we ask ourselves two questions: (1) Do I belong here? and (2) Can I succeed here? The answers should always be yes to both, but frequently the actions and words of white students make them feel differently. 

So a brief perusal of your comments gives me confidence in my prior assumptions. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but you say you have a Polish wife, you're a veteran, you own a $400k house, have a Master's in Engineering, and finally "I'm 100% white European background." 

Please take a look at some of the links I posted for you. It is super important that you expose yourself to the perspectives of people that have vastly different life experiences than yourself.

<TEXT> You are speaking for a group you are not apart of. You do not understand the intense discriminatory pressures on these communities. These assignments actually work quite well. I use them in the classes where I teach graduate students and post-docs how to teach. It is about understanding and accepting everyone's diverse backgrounds. Not everyone has the same experiences you do and it is naive to think they perceive the world as you do. 90% of what you see is behind your eyes.

This is not saying anyone is superior. You are just being willfully ignorant at this point. Privilege is a result of culture. Privilege is not some absolute measuring stick. It means you are treated differently by society not because of who you are but because of what you are. Every group in the US is confronted with having to think about their race every day...except white people. That is the point. Think about how you identify yourself. If you really actually care about this stuff and truly ending racism not just sweeping it under the rug, you need to educate yourself. It is very uncomfortable and unpleasant to be forced to think about these things. That's undeniable. But we have to do it if we are to understand our fellow Americans. It is the only way we can understand what they are going through, so that we can be more than just sympathetic to them and actually be empathetic. 

If you are interested in these topics you need to immerse yourself. I don't care if you wind up hating these concepts and completely disagreeing with me, but if you don't even try you cannot claim to be part of the solution.

<TEXT> The issue isn't the difficulty of suing. It is that people can sue at all. The government of a country has what's called sovereign immunity. This basically means a government can act in the interest of its country and people even if that means harming another nation and its people. If the US, the strongest country in the world, declares sovereign immunity null and void then there is nothing to stop other countries from passing similar laws and their citizens suing the US government. The list of possible countries would be staggering. Just to name a few you would have Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Russia, and Japan. Literally any harmful action our government takes could be used as a reason to sue us. That includes economic sanctions and military action.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like how you are using an article in a section of the BBC entitled Echo Chamber. That's pretty rich. The problem isn't that elites have implicit control in US politics, it's that the average voter doesn't voice their concerns either by not voting or blindly voting for a party because they are single issue voters. 

The problem lies in the average voter not the elite or the system. An oligarchy implies that the rich control the ballot box, which is false. The rich tend to control the narrative, but an engaged voter can see past it. Elections are influenced by spending money to persuade voters, not buy voters. 

Are you actually engaged in the system? Do you vote in EVERY election? If not, you are part of the problem. Money sways local elections much more easily than national elections. Engage with your local officials, your Representative, and all of your elected officials. If you write them or call them they will respond. If you get your fellow constituents together you can influence your own officials. The problem with big money is that they can spend money to organize people in multiple places around the country at once. It starts and ends with the voter and always has. That means it starts with you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What place do you think the US should have in the world? Us supremacy is the reason the Cold War ended without a nuclear holocaust. US strength and unwavering commitment to our allies in Europe is the reason Europe has been the most peaceful it has ever been. Do you seriously think we would not be dragged into a war should Russia invaded the Baltic States? Our commitment acts as a deterrent. Trump's comments are a blank check to Russia to do whatever it pleases without consequences. 

On Ukraine, we did in fact have a.treaty obligation to defend the sovereignty of their territorial integrity as outlined in the Budapest Memorandum. The UK, Russia, and the US promised to respect and uphold the territorial integrity of Ukraine in exchange for removing the nuclear missiles in Ukrainian territory. Russia's actions have decimated the integrity of non-proliferation actions. What assurances could we possibly offer Iran or N. Korea now when we have shown we will not honor such agreements. Your focus is narrow, selfish, and frankly ignorant of the issues in global diplomacy. None of these actions are single events. They have long term consequences in shaping the norms and actions of nations in the future.  The US needs to protect its interests and fulfilling our obligations is central to that goal.

<TEXT> You are exactly the moderate this thread is about. Who are you to say someone's protest is wrong? What moral authority do you claim? Have you had to suffer under the oppression the minorities face in this country? The hatred they face on a daily basis? Comparing absolute statistics is a completely inappropriate way to analyze the problem, you need to look at rates. You will find that minority groups face a disproportional amount of police abuse, housing discrimination, finance discrimination, you name it. These are problems brown people face EVERY SINGLE DAY. Have you ever been scared of a regular traffic stop? Have you ever had people look at you with disgust because of what you are or who you are dating? 

Crime is a good start because the right loves to pump up those statistics to show 'the others are lesser.' That is so fucking wrong it makes me sick to my stomach. High crime is what happens when an entire population is disenfranchised and marginalized. When there is no opportunity to lead a successful life in the mainstream the only other options are crime. 

Brother, you need to dispel you ignorance. You need to understand the problem and have some god damn empathy. You need to go into these communities and see it for yourself instead of smugly judging people from behind you computer screen. You know where that gets you? More fucking hate and the cycle continuing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A single payer system will inevitably push down doctor pay. The only way to prevent students from shying away from medical school debt because of a lack of financial return is to reduce the cost of educating doctors. This is a big reason we have such a shortage of geriatric doctors. There are tons of open fellowships but they don't fill up becuase the pay in that field tends to be much lower because of Medicare.

 I'm not sure if you are trying to say medical schools should lower their standards, but that would be horrible. What we could use more of are physician's assistants.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You missed the second half of my view on intervention, we have to build the social architecture to make our interventions achieve our goals and protect our interests in the long term. 

Afghanistan was certainly required. Would you have preferred having an entire country for Al Qaeda to operate in with impunity along with a government that openly supported them? Afghanistan under the Taliban was a major national security threat to the United States, both our interests overseas and our domestic security. The intervention was less of a problem than the reconstruction and insurgency that followed. 

Vietnam was a travesty, so was Operation Iraqi Freedom. (Fun fact: the original operation name was Operation Iraq Liberation, but the acronym kind of made it too obvious.) We accomplished exactly what we set out to in Operation Desert Storm. I don't know what you are talking about. We protected our interests in Kuwaiti oil, while also deterring Saddam from taking further extraterritorial military action without our approval. 


Being a fiscal conservative doesn't make me a miser. You have a very distorted view of what it means to be a fiscal conservative. There is more to this world and policies than money. There are many intangibles that are arguably more important. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well Charity Navigator also [downgraded](http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/09/clinton_foundation_gets_four_stars_from_charity_wa.html) the Clinton Foundation shortly after they donated $2 million to a partnership. That should show you they are not biased. 

The watchdog had previously rated the Clinton Foundation with four stars in 2007, and in 2012 downgraded it to three stars due to changes in its methodology. Its original four-star rating was based on the foundation's financial health and performance. In 2012, it also evaluated the charity on accountability and transparency. Charity Navigator requires five independent board members, but the foundation had only three during the 2009 fiscal year, Thatcher said. The downgrade came the same year that Charity Navigator was a member of the Clinton Global Initiative. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's why there are a bunch of poll workers. The idea is that all of the poll workers combined should be able to recognize most people in the precinct. Also, since you can only vote in your precinct it would be pretty impossible to vote multiple times. Your name wouldn't show up on the rolls of other precincts and once you sign in that's it, you can't vote again. You can try to impersonate someone else but you need to know their full name and what precinct they vote in and then hope they don't try voting and also haven't sent in an absentee ballot. The system is pretty rigorous and has worked pretty well for quite some time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not true at all. What is going on now is a twisted version of supply-side economics. The tax thing is really because Norquist is a giant asshole. Conservative economics is balancing the best of free market efficiency with government rules, more like the British Conservatives. Now, I am a center-right fiscal conservative and somewhat of a hawk. By that I mean I support military interventions if all other options have been exhausted, but we need to back them up with more funding through the State Department and USAID for any intervention to be successful.

I believe the government should spend its effort doing two things: (1) reduce inefficiencies in the market and (2) set and enforce the rules by which companies operate (i.e. regulations). Reducing inefficiencies also means realizing that is not possible in some areas. Prisons are my big issue, free markets put perverse pressures on private prison operators where they can really only post growth through recidivism and squeezing the money out of the inmates and families through morally questionable means. I also think the most efficient option for healthcare would be a single payer system coupled with more financial help for doctors going through medical school to prevent a shortage of doctors. Now, the best way to get to a single payer system is by expanding and reforming Medicaid and Medicare, until they cover nearly the entire population. At that point centralized reform would be politically amenable. Instead of traditional conservatism, think pragmatic libertarianism. Right now, I'm a disenfranchised Republican, because I do not support the religious right and its fight against religious liberties. I'm not a libertarian because I think the Fed is important, and I'm not a Democrat because there is a lot government expansion which is just ripe for corruption and is also terrible because the government is supposed to be terribly inefficient. That's a feature not a bug. It's to make it more difficult for our government to abuse our rights because institutional inertia should slow down decisions enough the public can take notice. 

I think the future of American conservatism will look more like the Tories in the UK (excluding the fiasco Cameron caused). </TEXT>

All this without raising our deficit by increasing taxes on the ultra wealthy. Hillary has been fighting for the rights of the disadvantaged since the beginning of her career. She has always been a fighter for our human rights. On top of that she will do great job at handling the complex foreign environment we currently find ourselves.

The same arrangement was in place at the previous house in Miami. The $5,500 per month rent was paid via Bannons accountants in Beverly Hills, but he was never there, according to someone with direct involvement in the rental arrangement, who requested anonymity for fear of repercussions from Bannon. In my opinion, he was not living there, said the source. He maybe came around twice a year for a couple of days at best, but he did not live there.

<TEXT> I really think globalization has confused the US population on how its government really works. The federal government is extremely limited in what it can do. The federal government takes the 30,000 foot view and operates from there. Most federal policies will have minimal affect on the average citizen, except for tax and social welfare policies. The rest is state government and the government we really see and that affects us the most is our local government. That's our counties, our towns, and our school boards. 

If people don't like they way things are run, local elections are where the action is. On top of that, local elections are frequently decided by a handful of votes.  </TEXT>

I'm not sure why that sounds so crazy.

His mother is American. He could have been born anywhere in the world and still been considered a natural-born citizen. 

Normally your religion is on your birth certificate.

<TEXT> Ok, your lack of explanation leaves much to be desired, but whatever.

Wew nice ad hominem.

Probably my favorite deflection from the typical armchair philosopher of reddit. But you know, you be you.

TPP, TTIP and TISA are far more than Trade deals

Yeah, of course they are. They are an attempt to secure the status quo and US global hegemony. The liberal world order relies on open borders and transparent rules to operate and bring prosperity to the world. 1 billion people have been pulled out of extreme poverty by this system over the past 20 years. These deals are not the boogeyman you are making them out to be. These are the same scare tactics used to get the people of Britain to vote to leave the EU. 

So the sweatshops in Africa and East Asia are just something I was dreaming about

These trade deals (though not with Africa) would create a regulatory framework similar to the one in the US. Sweatshops would become illegal with more mechanisms for enforcement. Binding other nations to this framework will pinch corruption a little harder and make trade a little easier. Sure, this means low-skilled jobs will move out of the US to regions with lower costs of labor, but why would this be a bad thing? Do we need unskilled labor in this country? Why don't we focus more on helping those left behind by globalization and the uneven economic prosperity it brings? Trying to reverse the trend of globalization will only hurt the American and world economies and it will not help anyone. 

Are these deals perfect? No. Can we do better? Most definitely. But progress is made piecemeal through compromise. You will never get anything done if you only act when things are perfect. If the forefathers of our nation did that, we would not have a United States of America.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The racism in things like the housing market and lending markets aren't because the banks or lenders are Racist 'per-say'

Unfortunately, this is just not true. There are banks today that are still being fined for discriminatory lending practices from big banks like [Wells Fargo](http://www.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2012/07/12/wells-fargo-to-pay-175-million-settlement-for-racist-lending-practices) being fined $175 million in 2012 to regional banks like [BancorpSouth](http://www.housingwire.com/articles/37405-bancorpsouth-fined-106-million-for-discriminatory-lending-redlining) being fined $10.6 million in 2016.

<TEXT> It is insufferable. However, it does make sense when you put it in the context of their experiences. Frequently, these men are white and have lived a life of privilege, never having to engage with someone typifying them because of what they are, and never really thinking about their identity on a day to day basis. This gets dangerous when coupled with high intelligence because more often than not, smart people don't like to think of others as less capable. They think everyone has the capacity to think through problems like they do. Unfortunately, that is just not true, but leads to the Libertarian mindset that everyone can handle all of these tasks and still be productive members of society.  </TEXT>

(R) or (L) lifetime voter here. Hillary's a career criminal who won't win another vote between now and election night, but will continue to lose them in big numbers every time she's accidentally put on TV. Being a legitimately repugnant human being running against a decent fellow is a dead end for her. And the attacks haven't even started.

Bernie's a solid human who, despite not lining up with a lot of us on politics, isn't a complete grifter. Put him up and I'll probably pick him over any of those (R) clowns. I'm in the minority of (R) for saying that, but we're a big enough minority to deliver the election to the other side. Heck, my wife and I are visiting your primaries this year to help him, even.

As far as I can see, the only screw up in the (D) side is not being 100% behind Bernie, the only real chance to pull any of the (R) you'll need to counter the Trump wave.

Signed, (R) maybe for Bernie. Maybe. Probably. If Hillary doesn't cost him my vote between now and then.

<TEXT> You would definitely be on the political fringe if you support those ideologies, though it is interesting because some of them are complete opposites. Can you explain what it is you like about each one?

Pure capitalism is now called libertarianism. This is not the world we live in anymore. We have regulations because it is understood people are shitty and illogical. The system is not about people being morally good, it is about people generally making good decisions when it comes to making money. Regulations exist to prevent the excesses of that system and reduce the economic swings inherent to it. 

One of the big tenets of anarchism is that the government should not have a monopoly on the use of force. When that happens you get warlords just like you have in Somalia. It may not have achieved the system on purpose, but it is an anarchist state now.

The president is stuck with it because of Bush. Look what happened when we pulled out of Iraq too quickly. We got ISIS. We can't just walk away from our obligations and think the problems will just go away or get better. Syria would be less of a murderfest if we got involved like we did in Libya. Libya is awful, but not worse off than Syria and there are fewer casualties in Libya. 

tax cuts for the rich

I think you are confusing platforms here. Trump and the Republican party still ascribe to trickle down economics and tax cuts for the rich. [Hillary's plan specifically raises taxes on people with income greater than $1 million](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals/full).

hand outs to big corporations

Come on their is a reason the Koch brothers hate the Dems so much. This is exactly the opposite of the Dem platform. 

sending jobs overseas

The president doesn't send jobs anywhere. Low-skilled jobs are just disappearing from a combination of globalization and automation. Would you rather pay more for your things? [Most Americans don't want to](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0ahUKEwjdydiZz5bOAhWC2yYKHRiPCUQQFgghMAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ftimworstall%2F2016%2F03%2F30%2Famericans-dont-want-american-goods-they-prefer-imports%2F usg=AFQjCNGrHnK8lrLYnKNkHqq4gA2NxWLxWA sig2=rNj73DgAWm3qeMKIewxBTQ) but that is exactly what Trump is promoting.

People like me help drive the economy through our success. Haters gonna hate. 

I'm not sure of you're downright evil or just too cowardly to fight back.

Hah! Neither, I just completely oppose socialism, and support secular liberalism. I have to be evil or a coward to be a neoliberal? What kind of delusional world do you live in? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Western influence can't truly affect the dynamic in the region, not in the long term. The best we can hope for is risk mitigation and containment. That is a big reason why there is such international support for defeating ISIS. There can be no stability in Syria as long as ISIS holds Syrian territory. The number of refugees would decrease dramatically if Assad regain control over all Syrian territory. Assad's return to power is the only stable option left. It's uncertain how this will affect lone wolf terrorist attacks. All of these issues short-term however. Post-invasion, the US has very little credibility in the Middle East beyond military and security support. That gives the US very little influence to support its interests.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well any real logical argument doesn't stand a chance against a Trump supporter from my experience. It doesn't matter how he blatantly twists crime statistics to make the country look less safe than it actually is even though violent crime is near the same levels as the 1950s. He strikes fear in our allies around the world as he espouses imperialism. His protectionist views on our trade agreements show a complete and utter lack of understanding. He can't maintain a coherent policy point in the least. He is against the 1st, 5th, and 14th amendment. Has Clinton said she is against any of our Constitution? Even if you think she wants to take your guns she at least has never directly said she doesn't like the 2nd amendment. 

The list of real reasons could go on forever, but I have never met a Trump supporter willing to engage. I've only encountered white supremacists and people calling me a cuck. So really, I have good cause for my distaste of Trump supporters.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really what gets me is the complete lack of intelligence in any of his policy statements....or I should say lack of coherent policy. He has not defined a single policy stance that he hasn't vacillated on **during** his campaign. He doesn't have the support of the professional community from which he needs to pull staffers and appointees. His pro-Russian stance is alarming. His overt imperialism in regards to NATO is frightening. He is **PRO** nuclear proliferation. Have you seen his [60 Minutes interview](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-trump-pence-republican-ticket/)? It was terrible! More so if you watch it rather than read it. Our allies are frightened and our enemies are licking their chops in anticipation of Trump.

<TEXT> Russia fucked itself over. Don't give me that Russian propagandist BS. Russian oligarchs robbed the country blind during its mass privatizations in the 1990s. This led to the economy tanking, the military rapidly contracting, and the loss of prestige on the world stage. Eastern Europeans were tired of being under the foot of Russia. What makes Russia's interests any more important than Poland's, Latvia's, Estonia's, and Lithuania's interests? These are countries that successfully democratized and privatized. To say this is NATO's fault is being willfully ignorant of the domestic situations that led to Russia's decline. Russia no longer has a leg to stand on when citing international agreements since they shredded the Budapest Memorandum. So please stop being a Western apologist and just accept Russia has gone down a path where our interests will not significantly match up without significant political change within Russia.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can only speak on this in terms of Saudi Arabia. The system Nixon started was a way to prevent the oil crisis caused by OPEC in the 1970s, essentially he wanted to remove the political threat of oil and by extension OPEC. Thus was born our close friendship with the Saudis. We promised them military aid in exchange for them investing their money back into US treasuries. Essentially, Saudi petrodollars (from my understanding is more a word describing the income from oil) would fund US spending, thereby creating a stable alliance between the US and the leader of OPEC.

<TEXT> Are you really going to call Hillary a liar and not Trump. He lies far more often and to just as much if not greater detriment. 

Putin sees Trump as someone he can manipulate to create rifts in NATO and other Western alliances. Russia is not our friend, not so long as it is under Putin. The best we can hope for is that it doesn't get worse. Obama tried reconciliation, he kept the missile shield out of Poland, which happened AFTER Russia invaded Georgia. Where did that get us? Crimea annexed by Russia and Eastern Ukraine in a frozen conflict. 

I said the conservative foreign policy community, not the political GOP establishment. They are two different things and even then the establishment isn't really united behind him. 

Trump wants to enforce a religious test on people and blames our ills on Mexicans and Muslims. He has said a judge cannot perform his duties because of his race. This is straight up institutionalized racism he is espousing. Can you frame it any other way?

Oh so he has creates jobs? How about all the small businesses he bankrupted by refusing to pay them?

<TEXT> Umm...what invasion of Syria?

Oh yes the coup, big whoop. It wouldn't be a US administration without fucking over at least one Latin American country. As much as I would love to discuss what ifs with you, it won't matter. Do you really think Honduras would have reinstalled him with both the Supreme Court and military against him? Do you really think that would have solved the problem or do you think this was a way at keeping the new Honduran government in our pocket? Realpolitik.

Uh, yeah. The post-war liberal world order is the most prosperous period in human existence. The wealth gap in the US and around the world is not a result of the repeal of the Glass-Steagall act, though it did help precipitate the Great Recession. The disparity is a result of globalization and automation (which accelerated as a result of the recession) leading to a permanent restructuring of our economic system. Our economy is rapidly moving away from labor and towards service. Our economy is moving out of the real world and in to the digital world. To think closing our borders to prevent the free movement of goods and services will help bring back jobs is just wrong. Instead it will drive further automation and wreak havoc on our economy and diminish our influence on the world stage.

I agree with you on the need to reform the way we pay for higher education, but that is not through free college. It starts with better high school career counseling, then we need better apprenticeship programs for the trades. Then to drive students into degree areas of greatest need, offer some sort of debt forgiveness or other financial assistance, but only to the best students. If you don't work hard and get the grades, then the cost is all your problem. Drop outs are the major source of the inflating student loan debt. 

Oh the big scary banks, they are strangling us all. /s A vibrant banking sector is a sign of a prosperous economy. The banks can support whoever they want just like you can. If you consider yourself part of any organized group with a political agenda then you are by definition a special interest. Liberal markets are what makes our economy strong.

Health care reform is necessary, but an all at once process is unwise. Dismantling the current system and installing a new one would be a disaster mired in legal challenges for years. It should start at the margins and work its way in. Improve  Medicare, expand Medicaid, and start offering government catastrophic support. Our health care costs are as much a result of our culture as it is industry influenced policy. We need to move away from treatment focused healthcare to preventive and wellness healthcare. There is some regulation needed to better govern the relationship between hospitals and insurance companies. Many procedures and medication are not accurately priced so as to give the illusion of a great insurance discount, but most of it is in the form of an adjustment by the hospital, not because of a payment by the insurance company. 

You can be angry, but allowing your passions to drive your reasoning is setting yourself up for failure. Have you ever made a wise decision when *you* were angry? 

What platform does Trump stand on? Isolationism. Protectionism. Scapegoating. People keep eating up his sound bites, but when you try to look deeper for some substance, there is nothing there. His business record is a joke. His **extreme** selfishness is dangerous. Can you name any redeeming policy or trait of Trump's that would persuade anyone?  </TEXT>

Isolationism is the right side of history? Trade wars are the right side of history? No, no to all of these. The center has just lost its focus on the message and needs to refine it and tell it in a more compelling way. There is not a single policy point of Trump's that would work. He has no concept of macroeconomic policy. He has less consistency of character than Hillary. Putin and Kim Jong Il both support his candidacy. That alone should be compelling enough.  Trump has no real allies in the beltway. The entire conservative foreign policy community refuses to work with him. His constantly espouse racism. There is no civility to his tone. He represents the absolute worst in us. How people can honestly say they trust him more than Clinton is beyond me. What has he EVER done that has given him the credibility of trust? Name one single thing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I would disagree with you now on what is and is not a factor. The factor primary to this case for her to be found negligent is evidence of unauthorized access. Having the private server wasn't negligent. She did what she thought was appropriate for her duties as Secretary of State. It is easily within her authority to decide the proper holding place of her information. Whether that was wise or not is another matter. On to (2) we see that there must be evidence of hacking or unauthorized access leading to the loss of sensitive material. Without evidence of such an event, what negligence is there? What harm is there? I can look up jargon definitions quite quickly. But hey good for you calling me out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Whoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, note, or information, relating to the national defense, (1) through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officer

Is the head of a department not capable of determining the proper place of custody? The server was in her possession the entire time and no one gained unauthorized access. Insomuch as there is no evidence of unauthorized access. It can not definitively be said one way or another. There is far too much doubt in the evidence of the case. Any experienced prosecutor or law enforcement officer would never send to trial a case they know they cannot win. Sending a losing case to trial would be nothing but a political farce. It would serve no interests other than political brinksmanship. Do you say her not going to trial under the evidence is political corruption? Well, I say bringing her to trial would be a bigger sign of political corruption. 

But hey, if you want to destroy the independence of government agencies be my guest. But when some authoritarian starts concentrating power, good luck when they start coming for us.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure I understand your logic. The make up and values of the groups I mentioned are not important. But to point out an error in your statement, communists certainly hate and despise Western values. The struggle between communist East and capitalist West defined the last half of the 20th century during the Cold War. Your other points seem to miss the narrative of deeply conservative Christian societies in the former Warsaw Pact countries, like Poland. Catholicism is anathema to Western secular liberalism, which is an outgrowth of Protestantism. Why does Ireland ban abortion, why are gays hated in Poland and other Eastern European nations like the former Yugoslavia? It is Christianity that drives these viewpoints.

Muslims don't hate Christians, they view them as misguided brothers. I won't argue with you on the Islam being against Judaism since it is literally written on the first page of the Quran. Religion in general is the problem not Islam specifically. Both religions are capable of spewing hate and both are capable of extolling virtue and peace. It depends on who is manipulating the masses and for what purpose. Islam is just a younger religion than Christianity and is going through many of the growing pains that Europe endured 400 years ago. Considering Islam is 700 years younger it is not that surprising. 

Rather than spout blind hatred for an entire group of people, why not extend an olive branch? Try to understand them so they can understand you. This us versus them narrative will only lead to more violence and hatred. Hatred breads hatred. Violence breads violence. Our values and strength mean we should be more tolerant to the abuse others give because we are better and we must lead the world by example.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everytime I hear someone wanting to wholesale ban a population based solely on religion this quote from Martin Niemller comes to mind.

"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out
Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out
Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for meand there was no one left to speak for me."

Just replace socialist with Muslim and well...there you go. This line of thinking has led to the absolute worst tragedies this world has every seen. This line of thinking has led to the worst atrocities the US has ever committed on its own soil, from the Native American genocide, to the Red Scare, to the internment of US citizens with Japanese heritage. Banning a group based solely on their religion goes against every fundamental belief and value our nation was founded on. Falling to the level of our enemies is not how we win, it is how they win. Our war against terrorism is as much a war against extremists as it is a war against ourselves. A test on whether we can uphold the values we hold most dear or whether we cast them aside in the name of security. Is it really worth winning if we have nothing left by the time it's all over?

<TEXT> To help clarify Rothkopf's argument, he is saying that she can't just run as the anti-Trump. That's what the other Republican candidates did and it lost them the race. The argument is that Clinton needs to make this about her and her policies. She needs to offer something new to show she has learned from her past mistakes and energize her supporters. If she were to keep hammering Trump it would legitamize him and his words and focus too much attention on him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You keep saying that, but offer no source or any argument. 

Really, the closest it could possible get is subsection f, but given the fact her only supervisor is the President and her ability to determine what is appropriate kind of muddles the argument and would rely quite a bit on interpretation without any guiding precedent. However, if she does get indicted under that section it will literally open up the entirety of the federal governments ITS to prosecution anytime anything is hacked. 

"...through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officer"

So unless you want to back up your claim of calling my statements old debunked arguments, I am inclined to say you in fact are the one that does not know what you are talking about.  </TEXT>

Whenever he is under any serious pressure he reverts to slander and name calling. He is no master business man. He inherited most of his wealth and came from a wealthy background. If you want to look at great businessmen why not people like Bill Gates, who came from a modest background to become the world's richest man. Not Trump whose business philosophy revolves around strategic bankruptcies. There is absolutely nothing in his past to suggest he would be a capable leader, let alone lead the world's largest organization.  </TEXT>

Maybe this will be like all the other jumps in human productivity and we will find new ways to work.

<TEXT> Not even close man. This has been happening since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The Middle East has no coherent identity. Think Europe and the Thirty Years' War. Their culture is smacking up against modernisation, globalisation, and intercultural contact like never before. Fear of the unknown is driving people towards conservatism and the belief that the past is better than the present and the only way to live a safe and prosperous life is to harken back to the rose colored past. But not everyone agrees on what past to follow. Turkey obviously supports the Ottoman history, Iran Persian history, and Sunni's the era of massive caliphates (which were all Sunni). This is causing everyone to fight with each other while trying to establish dominance and make others follow the best way, their way. 

If anything we only accelerated the collapse of a single country. I blame Libya on France. It is naive to think Saddam would have lasted forever and passed down the country to one of his sons (who were all terrible leaders by the way). The Arab Spring would have come and Iraq would either go the way of the rest or become like Syria. At least now we can get troops into Iraq. If Saddam was still in power we would probably be seeing massive killing of Shias which would goad Iran into invading and probably involve Saudi Arabia and it would just be a giant clusterfuck of Middle East countries fighting each other. Honestly, I think it is more tame now than it could have been had we not blown up one of the kettles early. </TEXT>

Islamists are literally **the only** organized political opposition force in every Middle East country. There is no way to not assist them. It is better to have them as fair weather allies than have no hands in the mix at all and let it be a slugfest with Russia, Bashar, and Iran on one side and the Syrian Sunnis on the other. If you are looking to start a series of Middle East genocides...well that's one way to do it. </TEXT>

If you can't do that it means either (a) there aren't many people that agree with you or (b) you aren't an effective leader/organizer. If you have a large amount of support you are called a 'special interest' and you will certainly be able to influence your elected officials. Have you ever tried being an activist?

Stark contrasts are what gains the attention of voters and drives them to the booth.

 In addition to Secretary Clinton, eight former Department employees declined OIG requests for interviews: (1) the

Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations to Secretary Clinton (2009-13); (5) the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic
Communication (2009-13); (6) the Director of the S/ES Office of Information Resources Management (2008-13); (7) a
Special Advisor to the Deputy Chief Information Officer (2009-13) who provided technical support for Secretary
Clintons personal email system; and (8) a Senior Advisor to the Department, who supervised responses to
Congressional inquiries (2014-15). Two additional individuals did not respond to OIG interview requests: the Deputy
Secretary of State for Management and Resources (2011-13) and an individual based in New York who provided
technical support for Secretary Clintons personal email system but who was never employed by the Department.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am certain you don't know what populism is. It is and always has been bad. It is a means to *control* an apathetic and ill-informed electorate, it is nothing more than ill-conceived political strategy. You get people riled up enough and they'll let you do anything....hmmmm....that brings to mind Venezuela and Brazil. I wonder how they are doing?  Or maybe the populism tearing apart the EU and supported by Russia?

Sanders is extremely far left and I am a moderate...more honestly a neoliberal so on policy Clinton is 100% the best option for my political views. Giving away shit that we can't afford is how we destroy our democracy and everything we as a nation have built over the last 240 years. Taxing ourselves into oblivion isn't going to help either. All Sanders plan will do for me is throw me into a hole I will never get out of. The entirety of my savings budget will go to new taxes. How will I build a better future for myself then? How will I afford a home? 

Have you not seen how poorly Sanders has run his campaign? I know this is like beating a dead horse but he is completely responsible for the disruptions at the Nevada Democratic Party convention. He did not train his operatives well enough to be able to handle the procedural complexity of the convention. How many people were late? Why were most of them Sanders supporters? The convention was slated to start at 9 but delayed 30 minutes in order to accommodate as many as possible. Then they get all in a huff when they can't follow the rules that had been posted on the state party's website for months! If he can't do that, what hope is there for his management abilities in the White House. But please, point me to his managerial successes.

Are you sure we have been paying attention to the same campaign? How many times has Sanders gotten red in the face with frustration? His whole fucking platform is about being pissed off and playing the victim card! His whole coalition is supported by pissed off people. Please try to convince me he isn't!

<TEXT> How about all of his policies? His egotism? His poor management skills? His anger and dismal understanding of reality? The fact he thinks he is always right and anyone that says otherwise is just part of the system bringing him down? Fanning the flames of nationalism and populism? He has absolutely NONE of the qualities I look for in a leader. How will he put a cabinet together? What will his NSC look like? What is his management style? What will his NEC look like? How will he pick ambassadors? How does he plan on handling a sharply divided congress and increasingly polarized poetical landscape? How will he deal with the constant accusations and attacks from Republicans? My guess is he will just explode with anger like he usually does. He does not have the temperament to lead. Being an "honest and upstanding" person does not mean they will be a good leader. This isnt some friend you're picking. This is the manager of the LARGEST and most complex business in the world. He doesn't have the friends or political capital in the beltway to make it work.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Calm your horses. I said no such thing about regulatory agencies. Corporations serve one purpose: to make money. Therefore it is the government's responsibility to prevent harm from profit chasing. I fully support government regulations, but not whole sale government services. I'm on the side of private-public partnerships. When devised properly these can increase accountability and efficiency if there is enough competition. My view is the government should set the rules and allow private industry to do most of the work. Certainly, there are areas that won't work well when privatized, things like FEMA and the prison system. Government has a tendency towards inefficiency and inertia, which is fine. I prefer it that way actually. This just means we need to be smart about how we do things so as to keep politics out of services as much as possible. The Federal Reserve is a good example of this though it too has started succumbing to partisan pressures and needs some reform. 

I have seen plenty of videos on the convention. No where did I say violence, you did. I said disruptions which is clearly evident. I'm not sure how much experience you have in highly procedural meetings like a convention, but they start at a predetermined time, not when everyone gets there. The convention actually started 30 minutes late in an attempt to accommodate as many people as possible. If you don't follow procedure to the letter it doesn't matter what you do it won't work. Everything was posted on the state party's website with plenty of time for people to educate and prepare themselves. Not effectively communicating that information is on the hands of the Sanders campaign. If you know you have a lot of novice activists in your campaign you should know you need to expend more resources on training and education. The fact the convention went the way it did is because of how ill-prepared the Sanders coalition was.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are falling behind? Want to follow that up with some sources?

The big thing many Sanders supporters seem to miss is that a lot of Americans don't want a socialist style government. You say we have a corruption problem, but before we tackle that you want to bloat the government doll with a huge number of expensive services that would hand out billions of dollars worth of contracts. I'm sure that will work out well! The simple fact is, I, like many other Americans, don't want the government to be in charge of those things. You have to remember congress controls the purse strings. Let's just say Sanders wins along with a supermajority of far left Dems. He expends all of his political capital his first two years jamming his agenda through congress and elicits a massive backlash and loses control of Congress. What happens to his agenda then? He will be blocked at every corner and we get more government shutdowns than we got with Obama because that is the mandate that brought in congress. Okay say he gets through 4 years but now the Republicans claim the white house and congress. They start rolling back his agenda or making his programs so dysfunctional the electorate wants them to get rid of them. Now we are left severely diminished after years of political infighting without our government capable of doing anything. There is no long term outcome that is positive with a Sanders presidency. He is not ready to be a leader. Just his comment on the Nevada convention is enough to show that. Regardless of what your opinion on the matter is he basically said he agreed with the disruption of the process and played the victim card. That is not what a leader does. A leader organizes his coalition and provides resources for them to be properly prepared. He is 100% responsible for what his followers do. By not strongly condemning the disruptions and telling his supporters to follow the process, he showed extreme weakness of character and acts like the dictators of the world that blame America for anything that goes wrong.

<TEXT> Every politician is kinda scummy, politics is inherently that way. Just think of office politics, do you like the person who is best at it? Maybe not, but they can get shit done. Hillary is a very typical politician. Her platform might change election to election, but she will fight for that platform if that is the mandate that brings her to office. That much I trust about her. I know what I cannot trust about her too. She will be under a microscope. She won't be able to get away with jack without screwing over her chance for re-election and the Democratic Party's chance for power. That's the good thing about a politician beholden to a party, there are more constraints on power.

 I am also a moderate. I don't think the government has any business providing many of the services Sanders wants to add to the government doll. Government agencies are much harder to keep accountable than private industry. There is just way more chance for corruption when you enlarge the services offered. Additionally, you lose efficiency and gain inertia. Just look at the VA for an example, Sanders certainly didn't help there by protecting the people in charge from being fired. [\[1\]](http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/election/2016/02/18/sanders-va-firing-problems/80506664/) [\[2\]](http://watchdog.org/255459/bernie-sanders-va-whistleblower/) In my opinion, free university would reduce the accountability of the students getting degrees. There would be even less motivation to get a meaningful degree if you aren't footing the bill. What good is a population full of humanities degrees? STEM degrees I can get on board with at the very most subsidizing. I really think the emphasis should go on better trade schools and apprenticeship programs combined with better high school career counseling. The government should also allow student loans to be discharged through bankruptcy. The current system just distorts the market and leads to massive inflation. I could support a single-payer healthcare system, but we need to slowly transition to it first through something like the ACA. Then slowly increase the coverage of Medicare and Medicaid and remove the [barriers](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/medicare-allow-price-gouging-prescription-drugs/) that prevent the government from negotiating prescription prices. 

In foreign affairs, Sanders is just plain wrong. American involvement in the world is absolutely necessary for stability. The balance of great powers leads to stability. Perceived weakness can lead to potentially dangerous confrontations. Just like with the Cuban Missile Crisis, except this time it will be more Chinese land reclamation and navigation limits in the South China Sea. Iran will become more aggressive in the Straight of Hormuz, Russia will further destabilize the EU. NATO, will be toothless without strong American backing and would be unable to act as a counterweight to Russian revanchism. China will continue to take advantage of Africa and bully its neighbors in Asia. There will be no one to force China to clamp down on North Korea. Without the US, Japan and South Korea are enemies. The left is falling in South American and with it any friendly faces to the self-described socialist. Clinton is the only one in the race with the experience and capability of maintaining US supremacy to promote a liberal rules-based world.

<TEXT> Were you there? Are you misrepresenting the facts? What would make your perspective right, then? Because you are pro-Sanders? Because he can only do good and this is just his supporters fighting the evil of the system? I've seen multiple videos from several angles and it is always the same thing.  Being the loudest doesn't make someone right. Having the most energy doesn't mean you have the most support. I'm tired of the hogwash coming out of the Sanders campaign making every loss and every slight seem like the entire establishment out to get him and his followers. In fact, it is his followers' inability to follow the rules, plan ahead, and formulate a plan that fits into the rules. This is a rules based system and ANYTIME people threaten that just because they lost and aren't happy is a travesty. Might as well give China the whole fucking South China Sea! While you are at it ,let Russia take the Donbass, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia! 

The system is just fucking complicated and hard as shit to make work your way. You have to build support and learn the rules. This takes time to do properly. You can't just have a big campaign and a bunch of stump speeches and say this is a revolution! That has to start down ballot. It has to start with *actionable* support. How do you think the Republican party has gained so much power? They played the long-game....like the 30 year long game. They slowly built local support into state support which allowed them to progressively draw more favorable districts. That patience has put them in a very good position. You and every single other Sanders supporter is completely naive in thinking one presidential campaign can do anything. Especially from a candidate that backhandedly supports violence. I would never vote for Sanders now and I would never support him in office. I would work my fingers to the bone to prevent that man from ever sitting in an important office again. He has no place in American politics just like Trump has no place in American politics. I hope you learn someday not to get swept up in the empty promises of a populist. Maybe this country will be better then. </TEXT>

We fight ideas with ideas, not chairs, vulgarities, and death threats. I for one lost all respect for Sanders after his response to the ruckus his supporters caused. He essentially, said it was acceptable to break down the democratic process into a maelstrom of screaming and violence. It is a real shame, people think he has great character, but that is just who he plays, that is the character he wants you to see. He is absolutely no different than any other politician. He just goes after the populist sentiment that is easy to capture, but impossible to control. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The term of material science is structure-property relationships. How does the structure of the material affect its properties. This goes across the fields of chemistry, physics, and engineering. Chemists are interested how monomers (repeat unit of macromolecules) affect properties such as degradation, kinetics, material properties. Physicists are interested in how the universal properties of macromolecules dictate their structure and affect the larger scale properties. These are things such as chain stiffness and architecture. Engineers focus on how processing and design can make the same material better. One example would be how crystallinity affects gas barrier properties.

Polyethylene is arguably the simplest polymer (macromolecule) but is used in a vast range of applications from grocery bags and milk jugs to orthopedic implants and bullet proof vests. The only difference is the molecular weight and amount of branching.  </TEXT>

To me this just sounds like people didn't go to the effort to learn the rules beforehand.

<TEXT> So, I believe in this amazing little American ideal called innocent until proven guilty. I don't follow the peoples court, mob justice is just plain immoral. What specifically makes her a terrible human being? What grievous crime is she guilty of committing? Can you substantiate any of it with *primary* evidence? Clinton is a politician that will promise what she can achieve, she is acutely aware of her strengths and weakness.

Sanders is a candidate promising the moon with no way of even getting there, no idea of the economic turmoil he would cause, no clue on the chaos a diminished US global presence would cause. He is too old to be so naive, too inexperienced in building a diverse coalition having sat in the comfort of Vermont for too long. He is a candidate of shallow blind promises. A candidate that sees a disaffected youth and says too them, here have some free stuff but never mind you won't actually benefit from it and the costs will prevent you from achieving anything financially in your lifetime. I'm not saying he's not honest and consistent, I'm just saying he is dead wrong and the government should be kept a million miles away from managing many of the things he wants it to.  </TEXT>

Russia's budget is stretched thin currently. They have substantially slowed down their modernization campaign to match this. Russia learned it's lesson trying to match the US in military spending, but still realizes how behind its military is after shriveling in the '90s. The most recent issue of Foreign Affairs focuses on Russia's military and foreign policy. It's behind a paywall but a subscription is pretty cheap. I'd highly recommend it.

<TEXT> Facebook monetizes it's user base. That's the important thing for them, that more and more people use the Facebook platform. Facebook is not open, if it was it could interact with other social media sites, such as Ello. Tesla opened its patents after benefiting from them greatly. Tesla's goal is to increase demand for EV infrastructure which will then create more demand for their product. Overly long patent periods stifle innovation. Patents do not intrinsically stifle innovation. I suggest looking into the history of Saint Gobain and the beginning of patents in France as a good example of why they are necessary. France's industrial sector was lagging behind Britain's which had already established patent protections. Once France did, French industry started to take off.  </TEXT>

Their subs are as loud as those America used in the '60s which limits their seafaring stealth. The Chinese military is only capable of defense and area denial. 

China certainly doesn't have a political advantage. Xi's current policies have a chance of being very explosive with the current economic slowdown coupled with the poor demographic situation. 

China has a lot of potential, but the cultural advantage you cited is also one of the main obstacles to transitioning to a consumer based economy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's the alternative to not having patent protection? Everything is a trade secret and won't be published then. What incentive is there to release your knowledge to the public if it can then just be taken by another? Then technological progress becomes a trade skill again and R D budgets have to focus on reverse-engineering the work of others or reinventing the wheel. 

Patents also protect startups. If a small company invents something large competitors with bigger R D budgets would be able to swoop in copy it and sell it at a lower price and destroy the competition. If I invent something as an individual I'm screwed. I can't make any money off of my work. It just gets "consumed by the market."

I completely and fundamentally disagree with these arguments in the excerpt. I will be honest I'm not going to read that link because it is over 650 pages...and frankly ain't nobody got time for that. But as someone that works in the forefront of technological development, patents are absolutely necessary. Reform is needed to match patent time to better align with current development cycles which have shortened dramatically. Development cycles have shortened thanks to increases in productivity from better characterization and analysis technology as well as process automation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is possible to have political viewpoints and values that you are absolutely not flexible on and will never compromise. But that doesn't mean you are not willing to compromise on pretty much everything else. Personally, I am socially liberal, but loathe the largess of government promoted by the left. This leaves me in a bit of a conundrum. I am all for progressive social policies and welfare, but through an effectively regulated semi-free market approach. The founders of the US designed our government to be inefficient as a means to limit its power. Efficiency comes from the private sector. I don't want a political crisis to damage our civil society. In my opinion government should serve to create the rules at the will of the people, interpret them in the context of our constitutional and common law framework, and enforce them. That leaves me with no party and struggling to associate with either viewpoint given the current political climate. Just starting your own party is pointless if you can't use it to express yourself in elected office.

Starting a party is a grueling process and in my opinion the biggest mistake third parties make is trying to start from the top down. That's not where the action is. A party needs to start at the local level in the US for it to become successful on a national level. That takes building a network of like minded individuals to run as independents first for things like school boards, city offices, and county offices. If you want a new party that is successful you need to have people with experience and you can't expect to pull any established politicians over without showing significant grassroot support in the electorate. But you build support and name recognition then you will have something to form a coherent party around a platform. This lets you start running party tickets and hopefully garner more support. This is easily a 10-15 year process of extreme passion and dedication from thousands of people. I think the climate is right for this kind of change, we just need people that want to go out and do it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe you are overestimating Russia. They have not had their way in either. Certainly Russia annexed Crimea, but that was a last resort since they lost influence over Ukraine as a whole. The armed conflict is in fact a failure of Russia as a global power. Ukraine is the motherland of Russian culture, but was lost by the greater pull of the West. 

Syria is another situation where Russia is vastly limited in achieving its aims, but Syria has been a thorn in Russia/USSR's side ever since the Assads came to power. They are more than willing to take everything from the Russians but their advice. Russia does not have near as much influence in Syria as it would like. Their recent actions have only served to prevent a further falling in their stature as a global power. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Smaller government doesn't necessarily mean smaller spending. It means a more efficient allocation of the resources the government already collects. The tea party and libertarian fringes have distorted what the traditional model of Republican small government really is. Government is inherently inefficient and in the US it was designed to be that way. This is where the big push for privatized social security and health care come from. The government should not be in the business of providing services for its people where market forces are able to replace the government. Rather the role of government should only be defining a set of rules for which the system to work. Privatizing social security would reduce the risk of fiscal mismanagement in the future because Congress would no longer be able to pilfer a fund that isn't there. The only services in which the government should be involved is those where market competition has a negative impact on the outcome of that service. The prime example being the prison system. How anyone thought for profit prisons was a good idea is beyond me. This is what has led to the eroding rights of the imprisoned and the squeezing of money from an already vulnerable population. The for profit system further increases the cycle of incarceration and violence by not really affecting recidivism rates.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Life is hard man, everything worth its salt is hard. That doesn't make it impossible and that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. That sentiment is a smack in the face of our forefathers who fought and died to give us the democracy we have today. Their first plan failed, but through hard work and compromise and we arrived at the constitutional democracy we enjoy today. To say it is too hard to vote, too hard to make a difference is to say everything that has happened in the Americas over the last 240+ years was a waste of time. Change begins with the people. Real change requires sacrifice, it requires pain. The change offered by this current administration eschewed pain and we wound up with a system that isn't any better.  </TEXT>

During the primaries we should vote not only on candidates but the specific issues we want to see answered by the candidates that the FEC then compiles and requires written responses form all candidates for all to read and become informed before the full election. Don't answer them? Well, you don't get to stay on the ballot.

<TEXT> Do you have any concept of the democratic institutions in this country? Bernie Sanders candidacy is dead in the water. Just because you are angry and this is what you want doesn't mean the majority of this country does. The United States has historically been much more conservative than our Western counterparts. A large part of this stems from the Cold War where the US fought local communist influence with hate and discrimination while Europe adopted many socialist policies to reduce the sway of Communism. What do you mean by deposed? A  president of the United States has never and will never be deposed. If he does something illegal he can be impeached and then removed from office, but there would never be a snap election. No such institution exists in the US. If he is removed then his VP would move to the presidency. If both are removed, then it is the Speaker of the House who would take the office, which would be Paul Ryan. There is literally no scenario where a far left progressive wins, it just doesn't match up with the US electorate. If you are really angry become a political activist, reach out to the community. The US government is very much a bottom-up structure. Rally progressives to run for state legislative primaries, build-up progressivism in state governments and take back the country in 2020 through redistricting after the census. That is the only path for progressives.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Hillary I see a leader that knows how to put a good team together. She has the connections to build a strong cabinet and the management skills to make it work. She is a pragmatist that is willing to give a little to move forward on the liberal agenda. She is the politician we need, but not the one we deserve. 

Sanders is inspiring, he can rally the Democratic electorate much like Obama. That is the fear though. Populism is great for the polls but bad for running a country. He doesn't have the greatest success in Congress, he does not have the network to build a strong cabinet, and I don't see him being a great manager. Sanders is the politician we deserve but would only serve to increase the gridlock in Washington.

<TEXT> I believe this is the right path to a more sustainable peace, but it is much more complicated than just giving the Sunnis in eastern Syria and western Iraq their own country. 


In the end it will boil down to three new countries. Syria will keep the coastal provinces like Latakia and the areas surrounding Damascus. These areas are much more loyal to Assad since it has the highest Alawite population. This will also appease Russia since it will easily be able to keep its Mediterranean naval base plus the other bases in Syria which all are within this territory. 

The next country would be a Kurdistan. To make this viable however would require Kurdish land from within Turkey. The only possible way to convince Turkey to give up the oil producing Kurdish lands within its territory would be to swap some of the Sunni oil producing regions of central Syria (the land immediately adjacent to the new, smaller Syria). Without this type of land swap Turkey would never allow an independent Kurdish state for fear of invigorating internal separatist movements. Kurdistan would also take northern Iraq which would form the heart and capital of the future Kurdish state. 

The remaining land in Iraq, being predominantly Shia by this point, would be its own country and almost inevitably fall under the influence of Iran. 

After all is said and done the region will have been split into two Shia nations and two Sunni nations. Two would fall under the influence of Iran and Russia, while the other two would be US allies. This would create a balance in the region that is the best possible chance for a sustainable peace. The details will be messy, but it is the only real option left.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Populism is dangerous much like nationalism. They are both very powerful tools for political change, but can easily run out of control. When this happens the politicians that stoked the nationalist or populist sentiment become beholden to it. The recent [unrest in China](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/11/japan-china-islands-dispute) when Tokyo bought the Senkaku Islands is an example of politicians losing control over the dialogue. Really, both are tools for reaching and unifying an uneducated or apathetic electorate/population. That in my opinion is what makes both 'bad'. </TEXT>

To call the past, to call history, irrelevant is asking for the hatred to keep growing. Why do you think the Europeans messed up the region so much? It was their total disregard for cultural, historical understanding. The Ottomans managed the region reasonably well because they knew the history and they were the culture.

<TEXT> Absolutely laughable! Like literally I was just laughing to myself right now. This deal is far more complex than just supporting big business so much more, but your base hatred for the nation, the only nation, that protects and nurtures the liberal order, is completely unfounded. Would Europe be better off if the US stopped subsidizing their defense budgets? How would they defend against Russian aggression? How would they defend against North African instability? How would the freedom of passage be maintained in the South China Sea? Who would monitor and help train the forces around the Horn of Africa to reduce piracy risks? Who would check the insane blind ambitions of North Korea? Who would keep Taiwan safe from China? Who would keep South Korea and Japan from going at each other? Who would keep Pakistan from becoming a failed state? Who would keep Israel in check? Who could keep China from bullying its neighbors into economic submission? Europe has already shown its disdain for global leadership and spreading the principles of liberal economic freedom. 

So get off of your fucking high horse and learn something about the world around. Learn the challenges that the world faces. The dangers to your lifestyle which is only support by the liberal world order. Do you want regressive policies? Fine, vote in your left-wing populist nationalists. Or hate immigrants? The policies of the far right are pretty much the same. Dismantle liberal markets and centralize state control. That can only help people! Let's make business decisions a political game! That will certainly improve efficiency, stability, and provide more jobs. Well it doesn't that's why Greece is a shit hole right now. No, its not because German is pushing austerity on Greece. Its because Greece fucking lied to the EU about its debts and spending levels and the cronyism that supported the bloated and wasteful bureaucracy that drove the Greek economy. 

I'm pretty sure you don't even know what freedom means, sitting there comfortably munching away on your snacks while smugly commenting on the evilness of the US and its destruction of Western values. Check yourself you fat twat, realize what real oppression is: losing your job because you voted for the wrong person, having your ballot pre-filled, not being able to travel to the next city without having to bribe at least one cop on the way, have to bribe bureaucrats to get even the most mundane things done. So next time you call the US the pest of the West look at the weakness and cowardice of the rest. UK is just a lap dog to money. German will continue to refuse the mantle of strong leadership, France's politicians can't stop fighting with eachother and their restrictive regulations to project any significant leadership. Who does that leave? Absolutely no one you fucking twat! </TEXT>

Singapore has one of the most secure food supplies of any nation and they barely grow anything on their own. Self-sufficiency is not a good policy to support this populist notion you are spouting. It is just pandering to specific industries and using populist messages to get the general population to swallow the overt protectionism.

<TEXT> Actually, it supports his claim that Bush was looking for a reason to go into Iraq.

pg. 31

"We had a ready-made portfolio of theories and plans about the threat Iraq represented. Such well-worn theories and plans concerning Iraq were more conveniently available than were any new conceptions the administration would have needed to create in order to respond against the actual source of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks. As Bob Woodward notes in *Bush at War*, before 9/11 "the Pentagon had been working for moths on developing a military option for Iraq. Everyone...believed Iraq President Saddam Hussein was a menace, a leader bent on acquiring and perhaps using weapons of mass destruction. Any serious, full-scale war against terrorism would have to make Iraq a target--eventually.""

"Although Iraq was seen as a potential threat to its neighbors, no study conducted by any reputable organization has ever suggested that it posed any direct threat to the United States. The United States had constrained Iraqi air strength by creating and maintaining no-fly zones since the First Gulf War. According to a 2001 assessment conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) regional and military expert Anthony Cordesman, "Iraq's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been cut sharply since before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait with per capita income (around $587 in 1999) and living standards far below pre-war levels.... In 1999, inflation was estimated at 135% and unemployment was high as well." In other words, in the moment before we attacked, Iraq was an impoverished country, and not one that could project any protracted threat to anyone." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course not all scientists have equal funding or credibility. Just because you have a PhD doesn't make you a great scientist, it doesn't even make you a good scientist. I know plenty of PhDs that can't design a good experiment to save their lives. You have a huge misconception of what it takes to become a good scientist. Just because someone has a PhD doesn't make them an absolute authority. Scientist are people too. They can lie, mislead, or be terrible at what they do. Why the fuck should they get an equal voice? Seeing this shit all the time is a huge pet peeve of mine. Quality is the most important thing in science, not quantity. People so often mistake the two it is extremely frustrating. Just because a paper is published doens't necessarily mean it is correct either. I just wrote a manuscript lambasting a study published in a great journal by a well respected scientist in my field because of his faulty assumptions and poor experimental procedure. 

If a scientist has a rigorous and quality critique then it will stand on its own upon review and will actually gain widespread support. If you look into the so-called deniers you'll find their methodology was shredded by subsequent studies from other scientists. That is how the field works. You can't make shit up and expect it to last very long in the scientific community. The general populace is another story, just look at how many people think vaccines cause autism.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It most certainly is science, which is defined by the scientific method. Just because the tools aren't yet refined does not belittle the scientific rigor. Models will certainly become more accurate with better data, but they are working with what good data is out this points that we should at least be doing something that limits pollution and emissions. If not for limiting climate change, at least improving public health.

The main argument is not consensus. That means you haven't even read the papers or any details on the experiments or results. The consensus argument is used against the variety of politicians and pundits somehow claiming they know best without any sort of scientific expertise. Please learn how to comment on science. Maybe start by actually learning the scientific method and what science means. Then read the reports, find primary sources. The media is absolutely terrible at accurately reporting science.

<TEXT> Are you sure you know what you are talking about? Dark matter is just a place holder in the standard model, much like how the Aether was for the propagation of light waves. However, [Michelson and Morley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment) attempted to prove the Aether's existence, but instead proved it didn't exist and laid the groundwork for Einstein's theory of relativity. The point is eventually experimental capabilities get to the point of being able to test theories, which always come first, and can either prove or disprove them. There was huge backlash at first, but the two went on to be the first Americans to win a Nobel prize.

<TEXT> That's the thing about science though, it's not a belief. Honestly, I don't trust a journalist to determine whether a scientist is 'eminent' in their field. The reputation of individual scientists is determined by their colleagues in the field. Their papers and methodology should stand on their own, offering both criticisms to perceived insufficiencies and corrections to those points. When you make claims against the consensus of a specific field, it requires extreme rigor and patience. The founder of my field of study, [Herman Staudinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Staudinger), faced many difficulties in convincing the scientific community that macromolecules exist. The absoluteness of science will always prevail regardless of opinions and politics, that is what makes it so powerful. The problem is the general population has very limited scientific literacy and relies on the media and politicians to explain it to them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One major thing to correct. 

 the substance can be heated so it becomes more runny/elastic, and then cooled back into a solid form

This is literally the opposite of elastic. Elasticity is the ability to reversibly deform. "Melted" glass is viscous not elastic. Also, only melting is only occurs with crystalline materials. The details are more suited for /r/askscience however. 


The most basic difference between glass (amorphous is another term to describe this) and crystal structures is the predictability of atomic placement. In a perfect single crystal, if you know the location of one atom, you know the location of all atoms in that crystal. In a glass, knowing the position of one atom does not give you any information on the position of other atoms.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was explicit in not directly mentioning it because as a direct comparison it is mostly untrue, but that is due to the different cultural context of the same political ideology. The race superiority only came about as political expediency of achieving those goals (along with the humiliation Germans faced in Europe), the Weimar Republic failed utterly at this point of controlling inflation even though the economic fundamentals of production were returning. 

Protectionism is 100% wrong. The best way to approach these problems is through the existing international institutions such as the WTO, much has the Obama administration has. The idea is that all the global economies follow a predictable set of rules to discourage direct state involvement. Protectionist policies only serve to legitimize the behavior of the other party, the whole stooping down to their level idea. We simply cannot do that if we want to make progress in securing a prosperous and safe future. Free trade discourages open conflict, particular between major powers. If China has truly wanted to damage our economy they had the perfect opportunity to when Russia approached them during the height of the financial crisis to dump shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which would have had a disastrous ripple effect through the US economy. Most of the problems now seem more related to an incompetent transition in economic production. The Chinese are pretty good at manage an economy focused around production, but are rather inept in the more complex, but more productive, services (e.g. engineering, finance, etc.). As for the currency manipulation, so what? Everyone nation does it: the US, China, Japan, the EU, you name it, they all do it. It is just a short-term macroeconomic tool. Long-term market pressure will force change that can either lead to reform or economic downturn (severity depending on the competency of those managing it).

Basically, protectionism would trigger a trade war. Tit for tat, until trust in the process starts to break down and the prospect of using force becomes more appealing. At this point, economic warfare could be just as, if not more, devastating than traditional warfare, thereby making it seem more appealing.

<TEXT> Bernie Sanders is unequivocally a nationalist socialist. There are no two ways about it. Many of his policy points on [trade](https://berniesanders.com/issues/creating-decent-paying-jobs/), would be economically devastating and quite possible lead to war. He stands against the liberal order that has overseen the most peaceful and prosperous era of human existence, which only prospers and grows through ever increasing globalization protected under the aegis of free trade. A Sanders presidency, expecting it would bring a favorable legislature, would drastically upset the global order. Fortunately, I believe US institutions are strong enough to stand up to him and his ideals even if he were elected. I doubt the Senate would ever be on his side. This would hobble much of his radical foreign trade policy, hopefully. 

If you really want to compare with past National Socialist parties, I would recommend this Foreign Affairs [essay](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/germany/1935-07-01/national-socialism-theory-and-practice) from 1935. Don't get me wrong I'm not pulling that card, but his core views are very toxic and potentially harmful (way too similar to the [25 points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Program)), but so is any political capital cultivated with nationalism.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What really needs to happen is to break down the obstacles in the labor market that lead to inefficiencies. I call this liberalizing the labor market. What prevents workers from moving with the demand of the market? Mainly skills and geography. The government has made some efforts in reducing barriers to moving through various tax incentives. I don't think much more can be done beyond that because then you start running into people wanting to stay for personal rather than financial reasons. There isn't any government policy that could overcome personal desires. The other more severely lacking one is skills. This requires a long-term cultural shift to significantly improve efficiency in the labor market. Education is the foundation of the labor market and that should start with a free education from pre-school through university and including trade schools. More emphasis needs placed on lifelong learning and developing flexible skill sets. This does not address the inefficiencies that tend to accumulate with age, however. Addressing this would require another tax similar to social security as a way to fund a comfortable stipend that depends on the size of the family while training full time for another field at an accredited school. This would be prohibitively expensive and risky to initially implement and would require a high productivity in the economy as a result of continuing automation. However far down the line this situation is, I still see this as an optimal intermediate on the path to a universal income. Which itself should only come after the rate of job automation levels off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reza Shah was forced to abdicate during WWII because of his perceived sympathies for the Axis powers and to ensure Soviet access to Iranian oil. The Revolution happened almost four decades later under the rule of his son. Iran under Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, was extremely secular, but that was not the root cause of the Revolution. Discontent was born from the greed and corruption of the Shah as he colluded with the AIOC and pilfered his countries oil wealth for personal gain. At this time, there were two main competing forms of government capitalist democracy (the West) and communism (the Soviets). The country and its people were repulsed by Western governance as it was seen being complicit with the plundering of their country, so that was not an option. Though secular, religion was still quite powerful, think of the US and Christianity during this time. This caused the religious establishment to be fearful of communism, officially atheistic, as they saw what the Soviets were doing to the Muslim countries around them. This really left only one powerful alternative, theocracy. People turned to their faith to relieve the burden of oppression. It is much like Ho Chi Minh reluctantly choosing communism as it was the only real alternative for fighting Western (French) colonialism. He was actually liked the US prior to our involvement in Vietnam. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for doing this AMA! 

My question regards the Israel nuclear program. This is one of the worst kept secrets in IR and a major sticking point in Middle East diplomacy. Recently, Javad Zarif published in [op-ed](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/31/iran-nuclear-deal-israel-vienna-treaty-middle-east-wmd) in the Guardian calling out Israel to disarm.  I understand Israel's desire for deterrence in a region surround by state enemies, but that threat has waned in recent decades with the rise of transnational terrorism. Deterrence simply doesn't work on non-state actors. It is also possible that political issues surrounding clandestine US involvement in the late '60s before the NPT could be holding this up. 

With this in mind, what do you think the ramifications would be if Israel declared its nuclear arsenal? Do you think it would be possible to convince Israel to disarm? How would this all intertwine with the ongoing Isreal-Palestinian peace process? 

Thank you again for taking your time to do this AMA. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Iran deal is interesting, but he made far too many geopolitical sacrifices for it in my opinion. Like the removal of the missile defense programs in Eastern Europe. Other areas of inaction and inability: His pathetic response to Crimea and Ukraine in general, his absolute failure with Syria, the Libya debacle, the cooling of relations with Brazil, the shitty relationship with both Israel *and* Palestine, his Egyptian response, his response to Chinese expansionism, his poor record with the AfPak problem and India, his Iraq strategy, the whole "reset" bullshit, intelligence reform, backing away from the Monroe doctrine, the list goes on. He pretty much has the whole world trembling scared because of his weakness on the global stage. 

The Cuban detente is awesome, but progress will stop for a while after his presidency regardless of the next president due to Cuban demands over reparations and Guantanamo. 

Gay marriage was all SCOTUS, the president had no say in the matter, though some executive action inched things forward a tad.

<TEXT> Well, first off the trade name is Tritan not Triton, which makes a huge difference. Triton is a surfactant. Though, you obviously don't seem to care. Secondly, you  have a tenuous grasp at best of the science here. Polyesters have a much better track record in terms of biocompatibility than polycarbonates produced via bis phenol A. Are you disgusted by the leaching in your disposable plastic bottles? No? That's because there isn't any and Tritan has even better chemical resistivity than PET. The only difference between the material in new 'indestructible' water bottles and the material in a soda bottle is a flexible cyclic monomer (not aromatic, which pretty obviously needs emphasized for you). This addition adds another mode of energy dissipation that drastically improves impact resistance, which is one of the hallmarks of PC. Why don't you actually educate yourself instead of regurgitating the idiotic leftist bullshit that is on the same level as climate change denial and anti-GMO 'pseudo "science"'. The extra quotation marks are to point out the idiocy of both.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I don't agree with the tone of this article or some of the assertions in it, I do agree with one of its core assumptions. "...economic sanctions forced Iran to choose between political stability at home and hegemony over the region." Sanctions alone, however, we're not the main culprit. It was Saudi Arabia refusing to lower oil output amid the free fall in oil prices. 

Iran to me seems to realize the benefit of becoming a mature and predictable member of the global community. Russia's economic problems really helped put this into focus. If a country as large and powerful as Russia can hurt so much from a combination of sanctions and low oil prices, what hope does Iran possibly have? Iran has a very vibrant culture and a younger generation yearning for the economic benefits they see around the world. It would be unwise for any government to sacrifice domestic stability over regional hegemony.  Without which the latter is doomed.  </TEXT>

What I am saying is that some child born to a poor family should have access to the same opportunities as someone from a wealthy family. The problem is most acute in education, more specifically pre-school, but continues on through higher education.  Why should the income levels of a child's parents determine their access to a high quality education, which very directly correlates to lifetime success?

The notion of equality in opportunity is rather new, and has driven the development of both communism and democracy. No one will argue that the poor are materially better off now than they have ever been, instead the argument is about creating a level playing field so abilities rather than resources guarantee success however it is defined.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I would argue that my country, the US, is unfit for such a position. We are a nation built on genocide, conquer and war, and since WWII (and especially since 9/11) we've proven that we do not hold any sort of moral high ground or inherent goodness.

Point to one country that has never killed a large population of people or conquered large areas while slaughtering many? US? Killed the Indians. Russia? Killed the Jews and political dissenters. China? Killed the intellectuals and dissenters. Europe? Killed a lot of people everywhere. There is no moral high ground on the global stage. You are a fool to think there ever was or ever could be such a thing. 

Russia is a shadow of its former self. It has been reduced to a squabbling regional power that can't even keep its puppets in power and instead completely disregard the rule based system they accuse the West of abusing, much like a spoiled child that no longer gets its way. The fact is Russia is not a reliable partner and the West missed its chance of making them so in their actions following the collapse of the USSR. 

Unless China matures it will never be a global power. It has no real allies in the world, and is making enemies left and right. If China cannot manage its economic transition they are doomed to the path of Japan or worse. Demographics are not on China's side either. China speaks of a multi-polar world with varying legitmate modes of governance, but what they truly mean is oligarchy and kleptocracy are fine and the people don't matter. Every nation that uses that type of argument is in support of maintaining the rule of the few of that of the many.  </TEXT>

If the state isn't involved what's the difference between dating someone and being married to someone? There isn't. Marriage is a vehicle for the distribution of legal rights. Law is governed by institutions either the state or religion. 

How do you propose legal decision making happening in polyamourous marriages? Do they have to vote? One person can't have more say than the other if the third is incapable for whatever reason. How does a divorce work if two people want to kick out the third? Is property split 2:1? How does it affect parental rights? It gets even worse the larger the group gets.

<TEXT> This article is typical Chinese 'academic of the party.' None of these talking points are new and all are unsubstantiated. 

 To some extent, the role of the G7 in global economic governance is negative. The IMF and the World Bank are under the control of G7 members. This is one of the reasons for the low implementation capacity of the G20.

This point is a prime example. How is G7 governance negative? Specifically what actions were negative? What alternatives can the Chinese offer? The biggest difference between current US hegemony and that which China hopes to achieve is that China wants to go it alone, building this East vs West reminiscent of the Cold War while alienating their regional allies. While the US may be  the "sole" superpower it can only claim that title standing on the backs of its allies. China has no reliable allies to combat this and the way the Chinese currently project power, they never will.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I imagine the stock markets would take a hit initially and fluctuate with the post-election rhetoric and his choices for the Fed and Treasury Secretary. If his tax increases go through there will be a major reshuffling of assets right before it goes into effect along with significant market volatility in the short term. The problem with progressive agendas is that markets don't like them very much in the short term because the implementation can be an unpredictable process. Campaign finance reform would probably be one of the first to pass along with massive amounts of litigation. Activist litigation is getting huge with all of the private money sloshing around and so much of it at risk with effective reforms. Foreign policy in general does not change much with the president, much of it is entrenched in the bureaucracy of the State Department and DoD (somethings just get put on the back burner waiting for a more favorable National Security Council). Just look at many of the problems Obama had with his Russia reset and trying to close down Guantanamo. TPP wouldn't get thrown out (the US would lose too much face in the region), but would certainly be delayed at least a decade and by the time anything is ready it may well be too late. Chinese economic policy tends to be more nimble because of central government control. 

Those are just a few of the things I can think of. It is important to remember that the entire executive branch isn't replaced with each new president just the management. There may be new directions, but the people doing the actual work are still the same and bureaucratic reform takes *forever.* Any significant changes wouldn't be noticeable until near the end of a second term, by which time a conservative would probably be elected and rollback at least some of the reforms. The American electorate tends to get tired of progressives because it requires so much more work and sacrifice with many of the benefits in the long term. A good example of this is the election of Harding after Wilson.

<TEXT> There are a few main fields of engineering to consider that are all very different: Civil, Chemical, Mechanical, and Materials. There are sub-divisions beyond these but they are the core of engineers. Bioengineering or Biomedical engineering are just some combo of the others with biology and physiology mixed in. I'm a materials engineer, specifically polymers, my dad is a civil engineer, and my sister is a chemical engineer. If you like to build structures that improve peoples lives then Civil engineering is great. This can range from working for a construction company on buildings, the government on infrastructure or development NGOs that build projects in underdeveloped countries. In my opinion mechanical engineers are the most versatile, I'm including aerospace here. Anything that moves has had a mechanical engineer design or optimize it at some point. MechEs can do things like aircraft/rocket design, cars, or industrial equipment to name a few. Chemical engineers can be found anywhere there are fluids. These engineers design fluid transport systems for things like refineries, chemical plants, nuclear reactors, vacuum pumps are some examples. Materials engineers work on designing the most elementary part of a manmade object: what it is made of. This type of engineering is much more closely related to science than the other fields of engineering at the undergraduate level but is a good mix of both. These types of engineers can work for pretty much any company that manufactures or designs anything. This is a great field with huge opportunities and flexibility for both industry and academia. From the BMEs I've met in industry when working for a medical device company as a research scientist and during undergrad the only recommendation I have is do another field first then get a masters or PhD in it. Don't get an undergrad BME degree, you just don't learn enough detail. I like to say BMEs know a little about a lot and a lot about nothing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Polymer Physicist here. Amorphous and crystalline are opposite terms, there is no such thing as an amorphous crystal. Polymers are long chains of molecules that pack together in either a disordered isotropic manner (amorphous phase) or an ordered anisotropic manner (crystalline phase). PET is a semi-crystalline polymer, but nearly 100% amorphous after processing and very slowly forms crystallites as it ages, which is noticeable by increasing opacity and brittleness. Gas molecules diffuse by snaking through the free volume of the polymer. Free volume describes regions of no electron density in a bulk whereby the gas molecule can fit. Only in the amorphous regions where chain packing is inefficient can gaps exist.

Silica Glass, or any other ceramic glass, doesn't have this free volume, it is a disordered ceramic wherein all of the atoms connect to those around it but don't form a repeating pattern, which would make it crystalline. This is what makes glass so much better then a polymer. 

Glass is not necessarily less reactive than a polymer. For example, the only container hydrofluoric acid can be stored in is a high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle.

<TEXT> 

If that standard of evidence is used universally for all manslaughter cases then as long as a group of people all shoot someone fatally, but it cannot be proven who fired the ultimate shot, everyone is not guilty. It seems an odd standard. 

This is an important part of criminal law and the reason firing squads were designed the way they were. If you are trying to determine who killed someone there cannot be any doubt the defendants actions individually led to the death of the victim. There is absolutely no way to determine whether the defendant's shot terminated the victim's life. Would the defendant's shots alone been enough to kill the victims? Maybe they were already beyond saving but still alive? The fact there is any doubt means the defendant can not be found guilty. The entire American judicial system is built around the idea that it is better to let 9 guilty men go free then have one innocent man go to jail. Too often, I think people forget this. 

I'm not saying I agree with any of the actions or the lack of severe disciplinary steps for everyone involved, but the law is supposed to be a cold emotionless bitch and shouldn't be swayed by the fervor of others.

<TEXT> You are kinda out of luck if you are looking for a single good source. You need to piece together articles on specific topics to see the truth and examine the bias. Some have mentioned the Economist, but it is important to know they embody the very definition of liberal, meaning open up everything to everyone to make their own choices, essentially a more pragmatic libertarianism than we see in the States. If you are looking for straight facts and no analyses you can look at the Associated Press, very good for factual details but can be a little shallow on understanding and context. I like to use Feedly to pull articles from various sources and read articles on the same topic to get a better understanding of the subject. It aggregates everything together pretty nicely for comparative reading.

<TEXT> I agree with you. His argument fails to mention that such a strategy requires no economic hiccups in China. Chinese authoritarian rule is not absolute and never has been. It requires 'benevolent leadership' derived from their Confucian moral philosophy. The Communist Party cannot maintain its style of rule without the economic growth they have had since they instituted market reforms in the '70s. Especially with Xi's reliance on Confucianism to legitimized many of his policies, the Party will inevitably need to become more flexible as their middle class increases. What that will look like is anyone's guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think you can say it is uniquely 'anti-China' bias. It is more the competition of global powers. Powerful nations always try to stay powerful and one way to do so is by limiting the power of others. Though the US is historically unique in that many of its policies result in the strengthening of other nations. Idealistically, the end goal of US foreign policy would result in the US not being the sole global power, but it wants others to play by a clear and transparent set of rules. This is why the US paid for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan. Every other nation in history  would have just let their enemies continue to waste away so as to never really pose a challenge. The push the US is making with China is to make it act more responsibly as a global power and future superpower. In my opinion the future of China is a certainty, a US policy success would not be in 'containing' China but would be getting them to be responsible stewards of an open global economy. This means pushing China into privatizing its state monopolies. State-owned enterprises is why China is pushing its territorial claims so strongly. National dominance only serves state-businesses, open internationally governed waters better serve private business interests. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see this as a much more one-sided alliance than this article portrays. China has a historical mistrust of Russia I don't see subsiding anytime soon. Many of these moves will only benefit China in the long run. The gas deal is part of China's strategy of securing a diverse energy supply. The military exercise will only benefit the Chinese as the seek to pull the expertise of the former super power. The collaboration on space exploration is another way for China to learn from the much more skilled and experienced Russian scientists. These are all moves of an rising power take the assets of a falling power. Russia just wants to maintain its freedom of influence as long as possible while China plays the long game of building up the expertise to become a legitimate super power challenge to American hegemony.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really it depends on what you think the future of the United States should look like and what level you approach it from. My biggest problem with populism is that it makes national governance personal. The fact is it is impossible to make everyone happy. What is best for a country is not necessarily best for a certain group, but in the long run people will adapt and the whole will be better for it.

His opposition to free-trade agreements is rather short-sighted and too inward looking. Take TPP for example. There is extremely vocal opposition for this mainly from blue collar workers, but in fact helps the US flex its comparative advantage muscles. The US is one of the largest agricultural produces and opening access to various Asian markets will boost trade substantial. In addition it will streamline the international regulatory scheme making it easier companies in every country operate internationally. Since this agreement would cover countries that make up nearly 40% of the global GDP it would also be a powerful rules-based system to balance China's less than transparent policies. Economic integration is one of the most powerful forces for peace in the 21st century. By not supporting this agreement it makes it easier for China to exert economic influence primarily through state-owned monopolies which will allow China to push its political will much more forcefully.

His support for tougher regulation on the banking sector and Wall Street is a more delicate issue. Too much pressure can drive business to more friendly regulatory environments, though only to a certain extent given the size of the US economy and the central importance of the dollar as a reserve currency. But the current size of banks are threatening US sovereignty. Nothing should be too big to fail. That means the power to control the economy is in the hands of a private elite with nothing to direct them but the hunt for profits. Keep in mind that business cannot be expected to act any differently as they are legally required to only focus on bringing profit and value to their shareholders or risk being sued and a board put in place that will. The risk needs to be split like it was before the repeal of Glass-Steagall. The system can still operate efficiently, but needs to be less centralized. 

A single payer system would be the most efficient and cost effective way to manage the nations healthcare, but would require convincing the American population to pay higher taxes while simultaneously tearing down the multi-billion dollar health insurance industry. Doing so would require not only an extremely progressive president like Sanders but also a super-majority of progressives in the Senate. 

Campaign finance reform is huge. The Citizens United v. FEC was a major mistake in my opinion. Correlating money to free speech undermines one of the basic tenets of a representative democracy of one person one vote one voice. This new policy basically eliminates the need for an informed and active electorate to support candidates and instead replaces them with a few ultra-wealthy individuals who promote an apathetic electorate while focusing on a small zealous portion of the electorate to drive their agendas.

<TEXT> Hello and thanks for doing this.

My question is regarding the Eurasian Economic Union. In addition to Russia's hard power push in Eastern Europe, Russia is pursuing a soft-power approach of economic integration to secure Russian hegemony in the former Soviet states of Central Asia through economic integration similar to the EU, but more of a center-periphery model. If Russia manages to weather its current economic crisis  and enables growth both domestically and through this EEU partnership it may attract other Central Asian countries to sign on. How do you think this will affect Sino-Russian relations vis-a-vis China's one belt, one road policy with the New Silk Road? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If a person is willing to risk their life for an opportunity across the sea and die a pointless life along the way, they should focus that desperation on fighting the reason they left.  Fight against the oppressors, sacrifice your life for your society you claim a part of. Leaving only makes the oppressor stronger because you leave behind people more unwilling to challenge the status quo. Every wealthy country had people fight and die to make their country the way it is. They didn't all just leave. How many Chinese had to die to get where they are today? How many Americans? How many Frenchman? How many Indians? Progress is a struggle against time. Instead of bringing these migrants into our society we should work to make theirs better, but it must start with them. They need to actually want it. Egypt tried and failed. Libya tried and failed. The whole Arab Spring failed except for maybe Tunisia. People weren't fighting against injustice and tyranny, they were only fighting for themselves.

These types of comments always make me super sad. I hate when people put education solely in terms of monetary costs and benefits. There is so much more to it than that. Soul searching is important and difficult, but it is the key to discovering what success means to you. It requires a lot of internal reflection and self-criticism. You need to learn you strengths and weaknesses.   Find not what makes you happy but what satisfies you. Search for what gives you that little twang in your heart that makes you feel alive and significant. That is what college is about.

<TEXT> I would disagree with you on the quality of this article. It fails to take into account many of the on-the-ground realities the US is currently facing. The political will in Europe supporting military expenditures has been declining in the decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The result is complacency in their security capabilities, while overly relying on the US to support them. This is an issue the US is facing all around the world currently. The article speaks of Europe as the most important region in US policy at the moment. This myopic view belies the fact that Russia is still an important player in many of the challenges the US is facing in the Middle East including the Syrian Revolution, IS, and Iranian nuclear negotiations. 
    Adding permanently stationed troops along the NATO periphery would be a massive escalation in tensions that would completely eliminate any productive dialogue in the Ukrainian war. [ An agreement](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_25468.htm) between NATO and Russia was made as one of Gorbachev's final acts as head of the USSR stating that NATO will not station troops in former Warsaw Pact states as an act of goodwill and a sign of mutual desire for peace. Though recent Russia doctrine has cited NATO expansion as a primary threat to Russian security, complete abandonment of the agreement is rather unsavory to the Europeans and particularly Germany as it would signal a return to a Cold War era style dichotomy of East vs West. Germany wants to avoid this at all costs as it would be quite bad for business.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> By, CANZUK I assume you mean Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. Honestly, I don't think it would ever happen. First off, they are too far geographically, and there is no political will for that to happen. The UK has the most advanced economy of the bunch, while Canada and Australia are major resource exporters and NZ relies a great deal on tourism. The political and economic mood would just make it seem like the old British Empire again. Australians aren't too keen on that, especially with what they did to [John Pillger](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/23/gough-whitlam-1975-coup-ended-australian-independence). Another issue would be the location of the capital. Who gets to host it? It is financially impractical to have a rotating capital like the EU (which itself is a colossal waste of money). There just isn't anywhere near enough political capital in such an idea to get anyone seriously talking about it.  

Economically, it isn't particularly viable either. The expansion and reinvention of their welfare system would be immensely expensive. There would be a sudden devaluation of the pound since the Australian and Canadian dollars are worth much less. Restructuring the sovereign debt of the countries would be good for everyone but the UK. Free travel would add anything since it pretty much already exists via automatic visas. 

But say all that happens somehow and goes fine. The next step is reconciling the regulatory schemes of all of the countries. This would drastically increase market risk and has potential to tank the economies as money moves to more stable regulatory environments. If everything is taken very slowly and the integration happens over 20-30 years the risk can be mitigated along with any negative economic impacts.

If you want to suddenly form a federal union over a short time then it will be an economic meltdown. If taken slowly and carefully without any global economic hiccups then it might happen. Politically though it would never happen. The UK would form a union with other non-EU European states long before they reached across the world to remake their old empire.  </TEXT>

With this and lacking the revolutionary history of many of its neighbors, there is little culturally Brazil can do to bring others into its sphere especially with how cozy they are with the US and the huge anti-US sentiment surrounding them. I think in the long-run there is potential, but it will require 20+ years of extremely strong growth like China before anything significant will change. Basically, they can only bring others into their sphere economically and they don't have a large enough economy for them to throw around their weight.

<TEXT> You definitely took away the wrong point from the failure of the Occupy movement. It is not that they were nonviolent. Look how Gandhi led India to independence. Their real problem was a lack of central leadership. There was no cohesive force pushing the message of the movement. No one for those in power to negotiate. The Occupy protesters wanted a diffuse decentralized structure, but that was ultimately their downfall. Violence just begets more violence. Hatred lead to hatred. If you really want to create a cycle of hate and violence then go ahead, start attacking the police, try to lead people to their definite death that can easily be justified by the government. Violence will get you no where but a bed in the cold hard ground.

<TEXT> This is huge. The printing press arguably started us on the long march towards globalization. Being able to quickly copy and distribute information was huge. Imagine if the printing press had existed during the Roman Era. They would have been able to push their culture even farther and the knowledge lost during the collapse of Rome would still exist. Copies would exist in many more places of their impressive technological achievements and Western Society wouldn't have been set back hundreds of years.  </TEXT>

That is extremely traumatizing for a young girl and can lead to them being ashamed about their natural bodily functions. I'm sorry this happened to you.
