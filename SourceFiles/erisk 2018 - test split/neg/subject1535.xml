<TEXT> I think it's because the book has fans all around the world, and if you see Neil Gaiman's social media feeds, people have been asking where they can watch it. Also it's probably because STARZ is a harder service to navigate than Netflix, which many people are familiar with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know. I'm conflicted. I know it's HBO, but given the way many UK to US adaptations go, it feels a bit iffy. Maybe if Dennis Kelly (the creator) were on board along with Fincher and Flynn, I'd feel a lot better if this does happen. Because then we'd know that they're making an effort to honour the spirit of the original series, even if they're probably remaking it but set in the States.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's probably my all-time favourite Gaiman book. You should check out his earlier graphic novel, 'The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch,' as it strikes a similar chord. 

As for other authors, Anna-Marie McLemore is good at creating that same lilting, dreamlike quality. Especially in her latest book, 'When the Moon Was Ours.' Erin Morgenstern and Stephanie Garber channeled similar tones in both 'The Night Circus' and 'Caraval,' respectively. Also great is Diane Setterfield's 'The Thirteenth Tale.'  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually really like the Cormoran Strike books, they're a good reminder that Rowling actually writes a well-plotted mystery. (Though I thought the third book was a bit too long even though I liked that Robin was getting more of a showcase.) 

But in terms of more contemporary authors I think Jasper Fforde is doing interesting stuff with the genre and his approach to it.  </TEXT>

Showtime didn't cancel it as much as John Logan, the creator, decided he wanted season 3 to be the last. Probably because he was tired of writing the whole series and getting very little recognition for how good the performances and writing was.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought the show did a really good job of showing how a lot of the issues that Hannah, and the rest of the characters, were dealing with were very systemic. Like yes, Hannah was slut shamed and objectified, but Jessica and Skye feel the effects of that too. Even Justin, Alex, and Tyler were affected. Especially when it comes to Bryce and his actions. Justin feels indebted, and Alex wants to fit in. While Tyler is also being bullied or picked on by his other classmates.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think the show needs to keep up the "reasons" conceit since we're already invested in these characters. But one way to do that, and still kind of feature Hannah is to explore Alex's suicide and what led to that. Because he was depressed after he and Jessica broke up, and what happened with Hannah was the last straw, but maybe there was something happening in his home life that first started the whole thing? He clearly does have some issues with his dad and his dad's job.  </TEXT>
