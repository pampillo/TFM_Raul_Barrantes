After determining that they were not legally limited to the use of quicklime for the process, they pouredsulfuric acidinto Czolgosz's coffin so that his body would be completely disfigured.[42]The warden estimated that the acid caused the body to disintegrate within twelve hours."

<TEXT> This story is about my cousin Chris.

On April 1st, 1964, the plane that Chris Finkbeiner was piloting crashed shortly after takeoff. Finkbeiner, who just six years earlier, had run against Orvil Faubus (the guy that opposed the Little Rock Nine with the National Guard) for the governorship of Arkansas, was a well known figure, but as you might expect, so was his wife.

Not knowing of her husband's death, she went shopping.  While she was shopping the story broke on the news.  The cashier recognized her and said, "I am so sorry to hear about your husband's death!" Thinking it was an April Fool's joke, it took her hours to comprehend that the news was real.

From the New York Times: http://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/02/2-die-in-arkansas-air-crash.html?_r=0

Fun fact: Chris Finkbeiner was also the inventor of the cheese dog

<TEXT> *A weaned harbor seal pup was resting onshore when an untagged male sea otter approached it, grasped it with its teeth and forepaws, bit it on the nose, and flipped it over. The harbor seal moved toward the water with the sea otter following closely. Once in the water, the sea otter gripped the harbor seals head with its forepaws and repeatedly bit it on the nose, causing a deep laceration. The sea otter and pup rolled violently in the water for approximately 15 min, while the pup struggled to free itself from the sea otters grasp. Finally, the sea otter positioned itself dorsal to the pups smaller body while grasping it by the head and holding it underwater in a position typical of mating sea otters. As the sea otter thrust his pelvis, his penis was extruded and intromission was observed. At 105 min into the encounter, the sea otter released the pup, now dead, and began grooming.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, you are being down-voted by idiots. You are exactly right.

To OP: This would be similar to him giving you his report card from middle school. It just means he didn't get any NJP or court martials...basically, other service members from his day and age would probably give him shit for not "having a good time"

Thank your grandfather for his service for me. He truly served in the last valiant war, if war can ever be such a thing. Just know that your grandpa is either a goodie-goodie or just really good at not getting caught having a good time.

For example: I had a great time. I was in the Navy eight years and I only received one good conduct. I had a good time.

<TEXT> I was stationed in Japan for two years on an aircraft carrier there.

If people dont think Japan can handle itself doesn't know their history.
 
US forces don't need to be there because they don't need to have their military force constitutionally restricted anymore. Japanese nationalism is no longer radicalized.

They deserve to be able to have the same defense capabilities as us and they deserve to fight for their own liberties. 

The continuance of forward-deployed American combat forces has to come to an end, as it holds back the intended influence of the UN.

A Trump-Mattis duo is far more dangerous a proposition than Japan calling their own shots. </TEXT>

Protest is a right that all Americans have because men and women have died /suffered unspeakable losses in order to make/keep America free for all of its people. It's not about being an "edgy little shit," how you put it. It's about being honest with ourselves that our Nation isn't so star-spangled awesome and we don't actually embody the ideals conveyed by the Anthem.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The flag is just a flag and the anthem is just a song. Any laws protecting the "sanctity" of the flag I.e. the Flag Code, were ruled unconstitutional, as it's regulations violate the First Amendment. Said amendment also guards you against reprisals for "voicing" how *you* feel about the anthem and what *you* believe it embodies. As long as you don't promote hatred with your protest, you are completely in your rights to do so.

<TEXT> Neil and Del are the most antithetic duo you could put into a John Hughes movie and still make it a functioning story line. While I think both John Candy and Steve Martin gave their best performances in this movie (The Jerk might have been the best for Steve; it's a toss-up for me), every single character that's introduced is nearly perfectly adversarial to how Neil was feeling at the time i.e. the jolly rental car lady vs. his incredibly irate demeanour. And even with all of these dynamics working against each other at what seems like a constant rate, the characters never lose their believability. It may be the greatest holiday comedy ever made because there are just so many damn good jokes in it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was about 8, me and my sis were complaining to our single mom about not getting what we wanted for Christmas. It was about the middle of January, I'm assuming. My mom, who had just spent the last year going through a divorce with my Dad, snapped, and had a 30 minute screaming breakdown about how SHE was Santa. As you might expect, I'm not very jolly around the holidays now </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ha. I'm not too sure what "be a man" means, but the best way to take control of a conversation/discussion/debate is to be informed on the subject matter

Also, allow your views to remain objective i.e. questionable and admit when you are wrong or atleast acknowledge the possibility that you MAY BE wrong.

Do these things and you'll be fine until you figure out the finer points.

Lastly, aometimes the smartest thing is to say is *nothing* so if you don't know anything about what's being said, just listen </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump wins, then gets impeached and forced out within the first year, because he's despised by most politicians, regardless of partisanship. 

Pence gets sworn in, only to last a few months before stepping down due to political pressure.

Paul Ryan assumes office as third in line, just in time for Democrats and Independents to take the House and Senate in two years.

Ryan, slighted and bitter, for being stuck in his third, unwanted position, becomes hammered and careless, loses the nuclear football at, you guessed it, a Superbowl party, and during the halftime of Super Bowl 53, all nukes go off simultaneously and the last thing we all see are Miley Cyrus's tits being rubbed in Mick Jagger's sun-spotted face.

<TEXT> That's an absurdly lax position to take when you just said the worst case scenario is murder if the book is taken too literally. 

Why not just take out all the hateful things? And why not omit all the archaic, no-longer-pertinent shit? It's intended to keep you as little and as insignificant as possible. It's not intended to empower anyone, it's intended to keep them delusional and in denial </TEXT>

<TEXT> Authoritarian religions, religions with one or more omnipotent god or savior, such as Christianity and Islam and Judaism, are overwhelmingly meant to keep you subservient and under someone's control, out of fear. Not only do they force you to fear other religions and proclaim their own as the one true religion, they also teach people to fear the darker sides of our own humanities.

These types of religion have caused more death and destruction than good.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love Bernie deeply, just as many of you. We fought with him, we worked with him, we became better people because of his resolve.
Because of these facts, we all feel a certain level of defeat because of today's 
My last post was deleted because apparently the campaigning for other candidates isn't allowed, but now, I ask the moderators to allow it. 
Bernie doesn't intend to keep running, or atleast I presume that after his announcement today. I also feel, since almost ALL of the followers of this sub endorsed Bernie, not because of his party affiliations, but because of his values and his stances. 
I feel as though the best use of this subreddit, for as long as it exists, is to segway Bern's belief structure behind another candidate.
Regardless of his political endorsement, his supporters deserve the right to be informed and educate themselves based on what they know ans then ultimately choose a candidate that doesn't necessarily include the bipartisan candidates....

<TEXT> If I can attempt to add to this already stellar response, I learned from a highly-decorated Vietnam vet that success comes more expeditiously to those who foster "ownership" in WHATEVER you do. If you acknowledge ownership of something, you unconsciously put your seal of approval on it because it's a direct reflection of your own efforts. Own your your profession or find one you don't mind owning...and stop listening to society and how it defines success.

We live in a Capitalist society where your class status is defined by how much capital you have. That's why our society perverts what "success" is. Stop listening to society and the media. It's all driven by Capitalist motives.

Be true to yourself; own what you decide to be and turn off the mainstream propaganda. 

Good luck, buddy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair, the US was definitely bombed and invaded. Hawaii was a US territory and we lost thousands there due to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, as well as having the Philippines, another US territory, which sustained some of the heaviest causality numbers of the war. In fact, there was even a successful Japanese bombing in Oregon that killed six people in 1945. 

While both PI and Hawaii were both American territories as a result of colonial expansion, they were still homes to American citizens, therefore, must be included. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have spent the past few days in Thailand while in a "treat-myself" vacation from my day gig in Japan where I'm stationed. On my first day out here in Phuket, I decided to go down to a few of the "classier establishments"(if you don't quite understand why I'm using a ridiculous amount of quotations, just Google Paying Beach, probably NSFW btw) After a lengthy perusement of the "local talent" and a thourough sampling of booze, a whiskey-fueled trip back to my hotel room to "freshen up" seemed llike the right call. I made it about half way to my hotel before I made a pit stop at a street-side bar to talk to a girl in a red dress. We hit it off pretty well. So well in fact, that I didn't immediately notice the not-so-convincing transvestite with "her" posse of compatriots that were immediately behind us that had them began to exchange loud, masculine Thai-speak with my ladyfriend. For the sake of not having any pictures, imagine a mid-90s version of Artie Lange in a tube top who just got a regrettable chin job done.  Despite this being a descent into what I can only imagine what resembles a LITERAL manifestation of the cusps of Paul Reuben's unconscious wantings, I weathered the barrage of advances from the hoard of "ladies" that were now swooping in with the persistence of gadflies.  Relatively unscathed, I made it through the night only mildly violated and asked my lady friend to accompany me to my room. 

I am terrible with names but the girl's name was Nancy and YES! every other question I asked her was to inquire of her natural gender, which was female. 

Because yesterday was my last day in Thailand, and I had a 6AM flight about a 45 minute drive away, I decided to reserve a driver and go back to the bar and find Nancy in hopes of just repeating the events of my first night. I returned to find Nancy and a depleted yet still formidable version of the tranny gang, spearheaded by Mr. Lange himself. After continued advances by the diversity squad, me and Nancy slipped away from the group after another heated exchange of their native tongue. At about 1AM, after telling her about my car service plans, she asked me the price of the trip. After divulging that it was 1000 baht and her getting WAY TOO UPSET over the equivalent of 30 USD, she insisted she would give me a ride on her scooter for half price but that she would have to drop her roommate off at their place first. Knowing I only had a backpack to carry and the whole thing would be a pretty good story to tell, I accepted. 
She left and then returned with her roommate, none other than Ms. Artie Lange AKA Mimi. Using my backpack as an eexcuse and with Nancy driving, decided it would be best to sit as far back on the helmet rack as possible, attempting to keep my uglies from bumping into Miss Lange's VIP entrance. One overlooked aspect of the ordeal on my part was the complete lack of sobriety on the part of the driver. We made it about a kilometer before she made her first death-defying maneuver around a chicken truck. Though she defied deaths clutches on that go-around, it became apparent that I had to chose between expiration or holding onto something "sturdier" than the helmet rack. At the sight of us rapidly approaching an even more suspect chicken truck, I instinctively latched onto Mimi's "hate handles," burying the side of my face into his/her back and hoping for the best. Mimi's response to my sudden epiphany of attraction during the 20 minute drive once we arrived at their place was to ask me to come upstairs for "one drink." After emphatically declining, I eventually arrived at the airport, safe and sound. I then felt compelled to do several "manly things" in rapid procession. I made out with Nancy, slapped her on the ads as she speed off and went into the airport and chugged a beer. No ragrets, folks!

<TEXT> A nice couple was sitting on the porch of their vacation home on a river in Canada. The woman raises her gaze from the book she was reading and stated to her partner, "Did you hear that a family of beavers moved into a nice place just up stream." The man looks up from the publication he was reading, smirks and stares disillusioned into the distance and said, "Well I'll be damned." </TEXT>
