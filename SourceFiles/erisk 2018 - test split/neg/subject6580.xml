<TEXT> Actually since posting this, I did a little research on the YouTubes and you know what? Lionheart's not too shabby, and Call to Arms is pretty good. I'll have to dig deeper into the post-2000 catalog. Glad I listened. Another thing, is that their mid- to late-80s sub-Def Leppard balladry is, for what it is, not awful. I mean, I can't listen to that stuff for more than two or three tracks at a time, but I guess I do have a soft spot for it, god help me. My opinion of this band seems to be consistently going up.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why Saxon is important to me. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 00:35:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I discovered Saxon late.

I was 25 before I bought my first Saxon LP. That's nearly ten years past. I'd heard the name before, possibly while flipping through an uncle's record collection, or maybe from watching one of VH1's *super-fuckin-saucy* retrospective mish-moshes. Who knows. I'm more of a casual metal fan, as it represents, maybe, 10-15% of my musical diet? Big on Sabbath and the other '70s heavies, NWOBHM, early thrash and that stoner/sludge/doom/desert business... but that's the extent of it. I never ventured too far in the Byzantine world of so-called extreme metal. Maybe just a pinch, a *sprinkle* of Meshuggah, but, like, whatever.

Anyway, Saxon... fuckin' A. They may look like a "beer soaked pub dart club," and decidedly un-metal, but I'm not one for fashion. But the sound, the *sound,* brothers and sisters, is what pulled me in. They sound like my mind's nostalgic  representation of a heavy early '80s metal outfit (I'm only referring to 1979-1984 Saxon, as I can't get into their more recent stuff and don't want to get into their mid-period). After two decades of trying to process all the music that's been part of me, whether it be Maiden/Priest/Lizzy twin-guitar attack or the NES Bionic Commando level where Joe's in the sewer and those blobs come out of the drains  and he has to grapple the ceiling with his *Bionic* arm and the music's all like dun-nuh-nuuhhhhh...dun-nuh-nuh-nuhhhhhh ( you know the one), my inner self has printed me a report and it reads "for fuck's sake, put the kids to bed and have a beer or ten and listen to Saxon." And godammit I comply.

As I sit here being figuratively pseudo-pummeled with some of the finest riffs that  South Yorkshire ever produced, I can't help but wish that it wasn't my dad who had a big, white trash trailer 'stache and knee-high socks with the blue strip on the calf, but *me*, as I might have had the chance to experience Saxon in real time, as the albums were released. I would have loved to comment on my neighbor's cousin's T-top Trans Am as he peeled out of the Dairy Queen parking lot while simultaneously soaking my girlfriend's basement, all the while slowly nodding my head in agreement to the stylings of "See the Light Shining" or perhaps "Never Surrender." I''ve launched myself into dreamland many-a night thinking of this. 

Please forgive me, as English *is* my first language, but can you forgive the face melting guitar of " Street Fighting Gang?" Don't think so, bro. 

For your benefit, I beg you to listen to more of this and get back to that early '80s nostalgic haze that calls you, even when you're not entirely sure you were ever there. 

My brain's dry now, besos y abrazos. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom was also killed in a car wreck; I was fifteen. I may be wrong, but I can trace most issues I've had since to be directly or indirectly related to this incident. People will offer their condolences, as well as seemingly unimportant bits of wisdom, and most, if not all, will sound worthless. And with this happening so recently,  they may be. You will hav to soldier through and raise your child with your mother in her memory. I'm so fucking sorry for your loss. Nothing can copmpare to that hurt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll bypass the Napoleons, Khans, and Alexander the Greats, and go right for General Anthony McAuliffe. After being encircled by the German army at Bastogne, the supply of food and ammo was dangerously low, and his unit was faced with almost certain destruction. When the German commander proposed that he surrender, he replied "Nuts." That may not seem like much when compared to those who have conquered half the known world, but it is indeed hard-fucking-core, imho.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh. All the males on both my parent's sides were Chicago tradesmen; plumbers, electricians, linemen, etc... and I grew up with a "buy it to last" ethic. I also moved to semi-rural Wisconsin seven years ago, where boots and jeans are considered casual wedding attire. I work in an office and wear slacks and wingtips to work, but when I'm off, I'm still very much of a Levi's and Thorogood kinda guy. When I go to "nicer" family functions in a polo and some Sperry's, I still get the occasional "What are you, a fag?" but that may just be my family. Point is, well, I don't have one. :/ </TEXT>

The sole will be great for those long hours, they don't look half-bad, and if you treat the leather, it'll resist a lot of those fluids and you can get more than a couple years out of them.

<TEXT> For the price, they're not worth it, in my opinion. They are nicely-styled boots, of which I've had two pairs - one harness, one side-zip. The leather tended to crease quite poorly, had too much loose grain, and the stitching was sub-par for the price. If you find a model of theirs that you like, chances are you can find a similar style made by a better manufacturer for a better cost. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, Docs, how I miss thee.


I purchased three pairs of 1460s (which were then made in England) in my late teens and early twenties, all of which I beat the hell out of. One pair lasted me two years as a laborer for a plumbing outfit I... labored for. Not bad considering they aren't a true work boot. One pair lasted me five, FIVE, years in the food service industry. That's five years of walking miles and miles a day for fifty to sixty hours a week. Astonishing. The last pair, which were my casual go-to in the beginning of their life, finally gave up the ghost two years back after long ago being relegated to the miscellaneous handy man/painting/I-don't-care-what-happens-to-these spot. They were at least eight years old. Wow.

After Dr. Martens ceased large scale production in England, I have purchased three pairs. The first pair took almost a month to break in, but once they were, they were really comfortable. Until the sole split down the middle after only having them for four months. Hmmm... Well, I chalked it up to a fluke, and order another pair shortly thereafter. This pair was sub-Walmart GARBAGE. The "leather" started cracking after five or six weeks of wear, and...whatever, they were trash. The third pair were plastic-looking leather, and, just... I can't even talk about it. It was the nail in the coffin. I'm done with a company which I once loved; a company that used to make a quality product. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a pair of ASOS brogues (don't remember the model name) and they came looking quite nice and they were reasonably comfortable from the get-go. After a few weeks, they started creasing horribly, getting loose grain all over and about four months in some of the stitching started to fray, and another month later it failed. I contacted customer service and was put on an endless loop of transfers, carbon copies, and "Uhhhhh..."s. I would not buy from them again.

Shirts would be another story, but this is my experience with the company.  </TEXT>
