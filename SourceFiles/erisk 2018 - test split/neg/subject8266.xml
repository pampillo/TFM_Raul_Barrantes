<TEXT> [**War and Turpentine by Stefan Hertmans**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27833668-war-and-turpentine), book. Goddamn fine book. A bit meta--author writing about his grandfather and the process of writing about his grandfather, plus he includes portions of his grandfather's journals. It's about war, it's about art and painting. It's great.  
  
[**Anything is Possible by Elizabeth Strout**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32080126-anything-is-possible), audiobook. She's quickly becoming a favorite author; subtle, humane, really relatable and believable characters and natural dialogue. Great collection interconnected stories and brings back Lucy Barton from her previous book. Love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. You shouldn't bother. It's a fruitless exercise. Why are you so judgmental about other people's reading habits?
  
  Voltaire, Camus, Rousseau, Sartre etc.  
  
You know, I've read those, and probably some of what you'd include in the "etc.," but I honestly didn't consider myself well read because when I read them I wasn't in a place to *read them* read them--it was coursework, my understanding of it was guided, and honestly it wasn't enjoyable for me.  
  
If there was ever a a time when I were to consider myself "well read", it would be now. I read more, I read broadly, and I enjoy a lot of it. What I don't do, however, is rub people's noses in it, or act smug about what I read (well...maybe a little!), or judge people for what they read (maybe if they don't read I'll judge them a bit...) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should try [To The Bright Edge of the World by Eowyn Ivey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27917957-to-the-bright-edge-of-the-world). Ostensibly it's about a man leaving his new wife to explore the interior wilds of Alaska on behalf of the US government not long after it had been purchased from the Russians, but really it's about much much more. It felt like 3 novels in one. There is the adventure narrative of our explorer hero told in diary entries and letters to his bride; there is the novel about his wife--and really her novel is about the birth of an artist, also told in diary entries and letters; then there is the book about a descendant of these two characters and the relationship between he, an aging man, and a 30-something museum curator in Alaska--and their epistolary novel is about the creation of a true friendship. The book is really quite beautiful, and Eowyn Ivey is a pretty startling writer. Highly recommend.  </TEXT>

What's modern? After WWII? 21st C.? Do you mean strictly in English? Or do you mean contemporary World Lit?

<TEXT> Their study was interesting but a little...myopic? I wonder if they did an additional map layer that included reading habits. However, I'll grant, the reasons I haven't put one up: 1) I live in an apartment building and they won't go for it; 2) at the moment, it's cost prohibitive. For the most part, these are books people have purchased and are getting rid of (for me, I'll drive around looking for LFL after HPB doesn't buy some of my books). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, man. I totally loved this book. I found it distressing and heartbreaking. Stories of every day life have a harrowing dimension because they're set in North Korea. I thought it effectively juxtaposed how the things we do everyday without a second thought or take for granted (visiting our mothers, spending a weekend with our grandchildren, raising a 2 year old, planting a tree in your backyard), all take on a new, malevolent patina. These stories felt significant even though they have the minutest plots. I think Pandemonium and Red Mushroom were the best stories, but I was engaged and invested in all of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part of that may be due to idea that the counter-culture has been commodified and become the dominant culture. Or, it could be that the culture is so diverse now it's stratified so that no one culture dominates...back in the 1950s, culture was a lot more stagnant, and homogeneous. Every ad, every marketing campaign nowadays look like those Benetton ads from the 90s. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read it as a freshman Lit major. I loved it. Really identified with his angst, with his anger, with his loneliness. After, I tore through all his books. Then, a buddy--who was similarly infatuated--and I started going through micro-fiche on campus looking for old, uncollected stories and printing those out.  
I want to reread it but I don't know when I will. I remember loving Franny and Zooey the most.

<TEXT> The one that really gets me is non-fiction. when I worked in bookstores people would come in looking for the non-fiction section. "Dude. That's like the WHOLE STORE. Narrow it down."  
Young Adult I think is geared towards high school kids. Get a lot of romantic tragedies (Fault in Our Stars), or romantic fantasy (Twilight).  
Contemporary is I think of the current era. For people that read a lot, that could be the last five years. For English majors, anything since the 90s? After whatever they define post-modern as... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. Just read it again last week. Scared the shit outta me. What seemed so fantastical and apocalyptic when I first read it 20 years ago seemed a lot more plausible...  
  
President and all of senate assassinated in capitol--blamed on Islamic terrorists...better suspend the constitution while we figure this all out. Suspend immigration. In fact, let's get the Jews outta here...they have their own country. Let's look to Jesus for redemption. Divorces are illegal now...in fact, 2nd marriages are illegitimate. Let's get rid of these gender traitors too--gotta purify our society. In fact, let's start from scratch...too many ladies are working right now, let's just suspend that...just for a bit. </TEXT>

It's been nominated for the [Man Booker International Prize](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/109710.Man_Booker_International_Prize_Longlist_2017). I had to order it from the UK to get one, it wasn't here when I bought it.  
Finishing up [**Judas by Amos Oz**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28114464-judas), audiobook. It's on the longlist for the same prize. I know the shortlist is out, but I wanna get a couple more under my belt before I see what made it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you exclusively used? Will you be able to order new books? Are you eventually moving to new book sales to become a hybrid? I worked in both new and used, and one hybrid. The hybrid really did it the best, I think, because it was able to cater to virtually every taste and desire. I'll tell you what the used bookstore did wrong: inattention to their inventory. Books would come in continually and be distributed to section leaders, but they would just sit. I had my own sections that I was constantly trying to prune and improve, and circulate, create new displays, etc. While others wouldn't do anything until a book moved out. Keep it lively, that way returning customers don't feel like they're looking at the same dead space every time.  
  
Also, if you buy and sell records, play some in the store. That's some great atmosphere.  
  
One of the things I got to do was podcasts: I would play book-related podcasts for a couple hours a day (this was at the hybrid), and we'd get a few sales from people hearing interviews with authors or hearing about a new book. Some we'd have to special order. </TEXT>

It really juxtaposes how the things we do everyday without a second thought or take for granted (visiting our mothers, spending a weekend with our grandchildren, raising a 2 year old, planting a tree in your backyard) with how they are done there and adds a new, malevolent--even riskier--element.

I'm starting to get through the [Man Booker International Prize Longlist](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/109710.The_Man_Booker_International_Prize_2017_Longlist), and this is my second title from that list.  
  
[**Black Moses by Alain Mabanckou**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32072988-black-moses), book. This is my third title from that long list. Set in an orphanage in the Congo, its a little funny, a little bittersweet, a little depressing.  
  
[**The Accusation: Forbidden Stories from Inside North Korea by Bandi**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30358510-the-accusation), book. Somehow, someone is writing short fiction *inside* North Korea (Bandi is a pseudonym), and it has been smuggled out for publication in South Korea, and now translated into English. These stories are affecting portraits of every day life in North Korea, and about how the things we do everyday without a second thought or take for granted (visiting our mothers, spending a weekend with our grandchildren, raising a 2 year old, planting a tree in your backyard), all take on a new, harrowing --even life or death--element when set in North Korea. These stories feel significant even though they are the minutest plots. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just finished up [**Ties by Domenico Starnone tras. by Jhumpa Lahiri**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31243077-ties), book. Pretty good book about a husband and wife, infidelity, their adult children, and a break in.  
  
Will start [**The Handmaid's Tale**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/688954.The_Handmaid_s_Tale) next in anticipation of the series.  
  
Finishing up [**A Separation by Katie Kitamura**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30407998-a-separation), audiobook. Pretty meh for this book, a little underwhelmed considering the hype. Can't wait to move on, frankly. It's oddly reminiscent of the Third Reich by Roberto Bolano, only not remotely as good. </TEXT>

[The Man Booker International Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Booker_International_Prize), used to be awarded for bodies of work like the Nobel, but now it's for individual titles in translation. They release a longlist every year of 13 books which is a pretty solid list. [2016](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/97621.Man_Booker_International_Prize_Longlist_2016), [2017](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/109710.The_Man_Booker_International_Prize_2017_Longlist).

<TEXT> Christ. Outer Dark by Cormac McCarthy:  
  
["Harmon was watching the man. Even the mute one stirred. The man took hold of the child and lifted it up. It was watching the fire. Holme saw the blade wink in the light like a long cats eye slant and malevolent and a dark smile erupted on the childs throat and went all broken down the front of it. The child made no sound. It hung there with its one eye glazing over like a wet stone and the black blood pumping down its naked belly. The mute one knelt forward. He was drooling and making little whimpering noises in his throat. He knelt with his hands outstretched and his nostrils rimpled delicately. The man handed him the child and he seized it up, looked once at Holme with witless eyes, and buried his moaning face in its throat."](/spoiler) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, that's what makes it all just a gross cash grab. Like I appreciate diversity, but don't just pull a character and add a Latino altern. You're just trying to force the "diversity dollars" to come in in addition to the regular readers. It's not like they can't afford to splash cash a new writers/artists with diverse ideas. Produce 20 new books and I bet some will stick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Exit West by Mohsin Hamid**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30688435-exit-west), audiobook. Solid book about pretty relevant topic, refugees. Very good.  
  
[**The General of the Dead Army by Ismail Kadare**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17898.The_General_of_the_Dead_Army), book. Book about an Italian general sent to Albania to search out dead soldiers from the invasion during WWII. Harrowing book, feels vital. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a law librarian but it took me years after completing my masters degree to find the career job. I live in a college town that cranks out library graduates every semester; it's a college town, everyone wants to stay. Every job applied for you have sometimes up to 200 applicants. A masters degree, at least here, gets your app looked at, and might get your foot in the door. Mine helped me get an library associates job ($8/hour, so I also worked at a local bookstore). I had that for 3 years. That job helped me get a library assistant job in another branch ($14/hour...still got that bookstore job but I'm buying more books). These two jobs served as a sort of apprenticeship for the career job I eventually got. In hindsight the masters degree was a stepping stone to get me into the world. </TEXT>

A) Yes. Not necessarily, girl on the train had over 4 stars for a while and I hated that stupid book.  
B) A lot of books I've read have under 1000 ratings. No. That's a stupid way to determine whether or not I'd read a book. </TEXT>

Plus it was the kid's idea because of the AA books he saw in the bookstore. I mean you can pretend that I'm saying skin color is the only way to identify with a character, but it isn't. But it's certainly plausible that these kids key in to reading by seeing themselves reflected in books. </TEXT>

I think that's the point of the book club. To get kids that might not otherwise be readers reading...a good starting point would be books with characters with whom they could identify. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a key/salient point of the article suggested that when he looked he couldn't find that many AA. It's something he wanted. Frankly, finding the AA books in the bookstore is what inspired him in the first place. I wonder why you care so much? Why is it such a foreign idea that a black child would want to read books with black characters. As a Latino, I can certainly identify with the plight of not finding books when I was a kid that spoke to me (in addition to the pirate, anthropomorphized animal, knights, athlete books). Reading about an athlete was cool; reading about Rafael Septien or Fernando Valenzuela was extra cool.

He's 11, starting book club for black kids. If he wants to read books about black kids there's nothing wrong with it. And it not suggestive of what books he'll read during his lifetime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really enjoyed it not as much as his first. Also, think he coulda turned up the scare factor a little bit...but I found the resolution satisfying. I listened to the audiobook and the reader (the author) has a very haunting voice. Worked better for his first book, but again, this was pretty solid. </TEXT>

There's a lot of pushback and a lot of superior-sounding "I only read quality books race and gender don't factor for me."

<TEXT> That's a shame. It's one of my favorite books. Interesting look at 2 ways of being an American: working hard making your way creating a nice middle class life; from that sanctuary, working to protest and destroy symbolically systems of oppression. It was also a good look at fatherhood and love. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I'm always engaging in longer term reading list. Last few years, I've been trying to read the [Booker Longlists](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/102225.Man_Booker_2016_Longlist_) before the awards are announced. Now, I'm going back and trying to read all the books from all the longslits since they started announcing them in 2007. Same for the [National Book Awards](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/103864.2016_National_Book_Award_for_Fiction_Longlist), but they've only done it since 2013. There's also the [Pulitzer Finalists](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/91326.Pulitzer_Prize_Nominees_for_Fiction_2010), but I've only gone as far back as 2010. I don't like this as much since they don't announce the list until *after* it's awarded...takes the participatory nature out of it.

<TITLE> In a book I'm disliking a sterling quote about a dusty used bookstore made me nostalgic for my favorite used bookstore, Nine Lives Books in San Antonio. What's your favorite dusty used bookstore? What's its story? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Nine Lives Books](https://www.google.com/search?q=nine+lives+books ie=UTF-8 oe=UTF-8 hl=en-us client=safari) used to have a cat rescue in the back called Tenth Live Cat Center (cuz they gave them one more chance...I think). There were always a bunch of cats walking around and there were tons of comfy chairs everywhere and books books books.  
  
The quote, from [**Michelle Tea's Black Wave**](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25330262-black-wave): "Then there was the used book and record store, an eyesore on the block...nothing but dust and wood and books, books everywhere, more than shelves could hold, books in tumbled piles, books invading the space reserved for records, heaped atop stacks of rare opera albums, books blocking the aisles and sliding off wooden carts...she regarded the grimy used bookstore. She belonged there. If it were an animal it would be her power animal, if it were a spirit it would be her guide."  
  
TL;DR: What's your favorite dusty used bookstore? What's its story? </TEXT>

<TEXT> james patterson - they all *appear* to be fill-in-the-blank style thrillers where only names and maybe settings change. The incredibly short chapters and the frequency with which he publishes suggests to me that he has five to ten word documents open, writes one double-spaced page in a 14 point font then moves on to the next document. Does that over and over again until he has 10 novels and starts over. I'm not entirely convinced he doesn't copy and paste from doc to doc then changes names and cities. CMV. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Middlesex by Eugenides  
American Pastoral by Roth  
  
Both capture the essence of Americanness that few others can. Middlesex by showing, by generations, how a family became American, and became embroiled in some of its history; American Pastoral by juxtaposing two...I don't want to say opposing Americans...but ways of being American...a get-ahead dad who made his way up in the family business to create sanctuary and middle-class life for his family, and his daughter who, under the umbrella of that security, lashed out at injustices she saw in the world.

<TEXT> I'm trying to make my way through the [2017 Tournament of Books List](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/107559.2017_Tournament_of_Books) before [the tournament starts in March](http://www.themorningnews.org/article/the-2017-tournament-of-books-shortlist-and-judges). I'm 11/18 books in, so a couple of this week's books are toward that tournament.  
  
[**Black Wave by Michelle Tea**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28818761-black-wave), book. So far its about lesbians in San Francisco...and it might be the end of the world? I've tried very hard not to read anything about it or the synopsis. There's hints here and there: all the trees are dead, animals are gone. I'm about 50 pages in yet but it's solid.  
  
[**Version Control by Dexter Palmer**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733442-version-control), audiobook. Great book so far, intriguing, not sure where it's going either. It's an alternative now...self driving cars, personalized messages from the president at your dinner table at a restaurant...there may be a time machine? Great story.  
  
[**Waking Gods: Themis Files 2 by Sylvain Neuvel**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30134847-waking-gods), ebook. Got a connection with an ARC ebook account. I'm about 50 pages into this, only read it at night as I'm going to bed. Loved the first book and this one is just as good. </TEXT>

**"The CCBC tracks how many books are published by and about people of color every year. Since 1994, it has had categories for black, Latino, Native American and Asian Pacific Americans, who make up a combined 38 percent of the population."**  
  
Plus, babies in the US is about [50% POC](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/01/484325664/babies-of-color-are-now-the-majority-census-says), so a growing diversity in children's literature would be appropriate. Children like to see their experiences reflected in their literature. Nothing wrong with that. </TEXT>

[**Universal Harvester by John Darnielle**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939268-universal-harvester), audiobook. Loved his first book, listened to the audio then too, read by the author, haunting reader. Really looking forward to this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) I can almost guarantee you're not going to be an exclusive audiobook consumer. You're gonna find yourself with some time on your hands and want to get engrossed. But you don't want to just sit there and listen. You're gonna pick up a book, maybe the same book, but maybe a different book. You're gonna have one audio, and one physical book going. As far as being a good writer, being a good reader is essential, but it isn't exclusively required. What matters most of all is how much time you devote to the craft of writing.

<TEXT> Man I loved that book, but I was a big fan of the era when I read it. Love Allen Ginsberg, too, the aesthetic of the group. I was in a real snobbish phase of my life. I would sit in my kitchen, no AC of course, Miles on the CD player, smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee in my underwear, my girlfriend naked and asleep on the couch under a thin sheet...and still I was jealous of the life in that book. The only thing I was missing was the aimless driving. Loved when they were in Mexico and they're driving through the jungle or something, and it's going super slow, and he's just laying down on top of the car watching the stars...that happened yes? Anyway, definitive of an era, evocative writing, interesting style. </TEXT>

Worst Book: [So Much for That Winter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114717-so-much-for-that-winter), I found too gimmicky and unlikable. This is the second book of hers I've read and the second book of hers I've hated. 2/5  
  
Best Book: [The Long Valley by John Steinbeck](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11353122-the-long-valley). Man could that man write. Last year, I started a project to read/listen to all the Steinbecks in chronological order, and this is one of best yet. Hard men, strange strange women throughout this collection...my favorite story was about the town...special needs dude?...who could do perfect impressions of everyone in town. He'd spy on people, and recite their most intimate and embarrassing conversations in exchange for whiskey. Great great story. </TEXT>

"The metaphor of the shark. In and of itself...spelled out, but that wasn't enough for DE! Literally spells it out: "All this. The fucking shark that eats the world."

Get it, the shark tank incident is like what the Circle is doing to the world!? IF you didn't get it with the initial metaphor, nor with the subsequent spelling out of the metaphor, DE is there to help you really REALLY get it, like three pages later: "Don't you see that everything that goes into that tank, with that beast, with THIS beast, will meet the same fate?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eggers in the Circle. Wrote a sex scene. Also, had a *transparent shark* brought up from the Marianas Trench and put it in an aquarium at sea level. And it had that shark eat a sea horse and it took the shark two bites. I don't think Eggers knows what a sea horse is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the problem is that you're thinking too hard about it. If you're not getting something out of the book *you're trying to read for pleasure* move on. Come back to it some other time. If you're trying to find a way into "literary" books, you don't have to start at the beginning. You can start in the now--as contemporary lit is probably a little more accessible. But really, you should read what you want to read and what *you like to read*, not what you think you should for some arbitrary reason. </TEXT>

Also, went to a University library book sale...ooof. Spent about $200. $50 alone went to 10 [Folio Society hardbacks](http://www.foliosociety.com/) in pristine condition they were selling for $5 each!! Can you believe that?!! Turned around and sold those for about $25 - $50 each. Made a nice penny and was able to buy more books for my personal collection. </TEXT>

I had some from World Market but I want something new and vibrant and apartment-friendly.

I thought, "I really like William Blake's art...wonder if they have any."  Short answer: [Not really.](http://www.redbubble.com/shop/william+blake+iphone-cases).  

Then I thought, "I bet I could upload that artwork myself...make a pretty penny..."  

Found [this warning](http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/faq/) on the William Blake Archives FAQ.

How is William Blake's artwork subject to US Copyright law?  Can I upload the work to Redbubble to make some scratch?  I see tons of comic book characters on there...how is this all possible? </TEXT>

I was wondering if any of you know where I can purchase one online or if a kind soul could hook an hermano up, I can send you some money paypal if youd like.

Alright, thanks, and GO SPURS GO! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Lawyers of r/law, I am a law librarian in need of help compiling a booklist </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-15 18:58:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello, I am a law librarian in a small, county courthouse law library.  We have two collections in our library, one that circulates to bar-licensed attorneys and circuit court staff and judges, and the other that circulates to the inmates of two local jails.  We're getting ready to apply for a grant to purchase new books for the jail collection.

While we have several NOLO guides in the collection (rep yourself in court, crim law handbook), many of the in-a-nutshell guides, and lots of copies of Black's legal dictionaries, most of the collection consists of statute books, six volume treatises on Crim. Procedure, and discarded books written for practicing lawyers and judges...so they are often targeted beyond their needs or understanding.

And, unfortunately, most-if-not-all of the catalogs we receive are not for the lay reader.  

I need help compiling a list of books and self-help materials that would be useful to the inmates of these jails, books that are easy to read and understand, focused on criminal and family law (a lot of parents in there)...

TIA </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT] [MOVIE] European Kids Movie with a Redhead Lead </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-13 09:47:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last night I feel pretty deep into a trailer hole.  At some point I saw a trailer for a live action kids movie and the language sounded Scandinavian.  It concerns a redheaded kid with a mop top, the setting seems to be an old or ancient or Norse time, kid has what looks like a giant for a father with a long black beard, and there is an epic ship battle that takes up much of the trailer. The kid has a best friend who's wild and dirty...tried to retrace my steps for a couple of hours today with no luck.

Oh, one more thing to narrow down the era, the film was advertised as coming in 3-D, so...that should narrow it down to the last couple/few years, no?
