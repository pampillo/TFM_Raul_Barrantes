<TEXT> I've recently started to watch movies regularly and I love going to the cinema to watch all kinds of movies. As I only started this recently, I feel like I have missed some really good movies in the past. What are some movies that you think are a must see? 

I have been thinking of movies like Alien, Shawshank Redemption, Reservoir Dogs, Lord of The Rings (Which I am ashamed to have not seen them already)...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hat spa gemacht, auch trotz der kleinen Fehler. Die Regeln kenne ich auch in bisschen anderer Form. 

* Die Hexe darf erfahren wer gerettet werden kann
* Es mssen mind. eine Person gestellt werden die dann gettet werden kann d.H. Person A sagt das es Person B war und Person B sagt das es Person A war, nun knnen die anderen Personen fr A oder B stimmen (Frdert Diskussionen)

Zudem ist es immer schn wenn man etwas in der Rolle bleibt wie z.B. Gregor. War schon gut wie er sich eine Backstory berlegt hat und versucht hat damit zu argumentieren. So htte Marco zum Beispiel sagen knnen, dass es in seinem Bett lag und dann etwas am Brunnen gehrt hat, und meint das es Lars schlabbern war. Somit entwickelt sich dann eine kleine Diskussion die andere natrlich untersttzen knnen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Schade ich habe das AmA leider verpasst aber ich stelle trotzdem mal meine Fragen fr die kommenden Tage. Dabei drehen sich meine Fragen hauptschlich um ein paar Wirtschaftsaspekte und dann am Ende noch ein paar generelle Fragen.

**Frage 1:**

 Wirtschaftliche Beziehungen auf internationaler Ebene sollten nur dann mit undemokratischen und menschenrechtsverletzenden Regierungen eingegangen werden, wenn dadurch die Situation der Menschen vor Ort verbessert werden kann.

Ich stehe hinter der Idee nur mit Regierungen zu handeln die demokratisch sind und die Menschenrechte nicht verletzen. Jedoch bin ich der Meinung das wir Wirtschaftsbeziehungen mit Lndern wie zum Beispiel China brauchen um uns wirtschaftlich relevant zu halten. Wie wollt ihr dieses Problem angehen? 

**Frage 2:**

 Alle Brger sollten in eine einheitliche und solidarische Krankenversicherung einzahlen, privat kann in zustzliche Versicherungen eingezahlt werden.

Wir haben doch eine solide Krankenversicherung. Ich gehe jetzt mal davon aus das die These bedeutet ,,Krankenversicherung ist Pflicht wie zur Zeit, aber extra Leistungen knnt ihr euch selber Kaufen." Was wrdet ihr also an dem jetzigen System ndern? 

**Frage 3:**

 Es sollte deutlich mehr in Bildung investiert werden.

 Der Schulsport ist wichtig fr die Gesundheit der Kinder. Dieser muss ebenso wie nichtkommerzielle Sportvereine oder andere institutionelle und nichtkommerzielle Sportorganisationen strker vom Staat gefrdert werden.

 Die wissenschaftliche Forschung in Deutschland sollte intensiv und strker als bisher gefrdert werden.

 Deutschland sollte absehbar wichtige neue Technologien strker finanziell frdern.

Alle diese Punkte machen Sinn und sind meiner Meinung nach Lohnenswert. Wie plant ihr diese Frderungen zu untersttzen? Oder welche Frderungen mssten gekrzt werden? 

**Frage 4:**

 Der Religionsunterricht sollte abgeschafft werden. Ein gemeinsamer Ethikunterricht sollte neutral ber alle Religionen informieren.

Grundstzlich bin ich auch dafr den Religionsunterricht abzuschaffen aber ich habe auch gute Erfahrungen mit dem Religionsunterricht gemacht. Zur Zeit mache ich mein Abitur und da ist der Religionsunterricht natrlich viel theoretische Religion und ist viel mit dem suchen nach Bibelstellen verbunden. In der Realschule sah der Religionsunterricht eher nach dem was ich mir unter Ethikunterricht vorstellen wrde aus. Wir haben auch etwas zu dem Christentum gemacht, jedoch auch viel zum Hinduismus, dem Islam und auch Themen wie der Sterbehilfe und Organspende. Wie sollte man sich den Ethikunterricht der Humanisten vorstellen? 

**Frage 5:**

Ich bin mir sicher das die Humanisten sehr ansprechend fr die jngere Generation ist und als "Mitmach Partei" sicher auch attraktiv fr diese Generation ist. Wie wollt ihr die Whler aus dieser Generation ansprechen bzw fr euch gewinnen?

<TEXT> Praise the sun \\[T]/

After hours and hours of playing DS1 and waiting months to finally buy Dark Souls II I finished the game. It took me 33 hours and mostly blind. The only time that I looked something up was when I was stuck in some place for a few hours and didn't know where to go. I really enjoyed this game and had a great time with fellow players. 

I wanted to share with you how the start of my journey looked and the end of my journey. I took [two pictures](http://imgur.com/a/X4QdO), but I am sorry that there is a message in the first one. I think I got blinded by the sun light. 

Have a great day and don't hollow!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Champions: Return to Arms

It seems like nobody knows about this game but I'll give a short summery. Champions: Return to Arms is a RPG in the EverQuest universe. You chose a race, a class and then you level up and acquire new skills and loot the fuck out of your enemies. The special thing about this game is that at the start of the game, you chose a path. Either be the good guy, or the bad guy. The decision affects the ending and the bossfight at the end. 

I used to play it for hours and hours with my brother and a friend, yes it had a local 4 player mode.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> #Eine kleine Erklrung warum dieses Bild aus dem Muster fllt.

Werte Maimai Genieer und Knstler. Normalerweise ist das Format ein Bild eines Politikers oder einer Politikerin, jedoch wollte ich mal etwas neues Versuchen und habe ein bisschen in meiner Maimai Schmiede rum gewerkelt. Ja die Qualitt ist sehr niedrig und warum auch immer ist die Hand noch schlimmer, aber mich wrde es trotzdem interessieren wie ihr dazu steht ein bisschen frischen Wind in diesen Subreddit zu bringen und die Bilder ein bisschen zu bearbeiten. 

Auerdem wei ich das ich dieses Bild schon benutzt habe aber "Knarrenbauer" finde ich einfach immer noch lustig und die Geste passt perfekt fr eine Pistole.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although people give pineapples on pizza a bad reputation I urge you to try it. If you don't like pineapple it sure might not be your taste but if you don't mind the taste of pineapple you are in for a good time as they kinda fruit up the whole thing while not ruining the base concept of the pizza.

My tip, order a Kebab pizza with pineapple. I know it sounds weird but the fruity little pineapple pieces fit right in with the meat and also make for good decoration on your pizza. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello,

I got a call from my brother and he asked me if I still know a bit French and yeah, Je parle un peut fraincais. And I have to call a car dealer in France and ask him some question about a car. I had a bit of a struggle trying to get the translation right and I hope you guys can help me fix any mistakes and maybe help me with one or two more sentences.

* Is the car still available? / La voiture est toujours l?
* Is the car free of accidents? / Est-ce la voiture sans accidents?
* Is the paint without damage? / Est-ce la peindre sans dommage?
* How much is the car? / Combie ca cote la voiture?

And then I might need help with something like "Hello I am calling because of the car *and then the car model*"

Oh and how do I ask him to speak slower, since I was in France once and the people there spoke very fast and it was hard to understand. 

I hope you can help a German in need.

<TITLE> Ich suche ein Schlerpraktikum im Bereich EDV und bin ratlos </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-23 18:12:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Erstmal ein bisschen zu dem Motiv warum ich ein Schlerpraktikum im Bereich EDV suche:

Ich mache zur Zeit mein Abitur im Bereich Mathematik und Informatik und muss im Rahmen dieses Abiturs ein Praktikum ber zwei Wochen ablegen. 

Nun habe ich Lust auf dieses Praktikum, da ich merke das das Abitur einfach nichts fr mich ist und ich praktische Erfahrungen machen will. Das Problem fngt nur damit an, wen schreibe ich an? Ich habe schon Firmen rausgesucht und auch Praktikumsstellen im Internet gesucht. Natrlich habe ich erstmal nach einem Praktikum gefragt und habe bis jetzt nur 2 von 6 Rckschriften bekommen. Aber ich wei einfach nicht mehr wie es weiter geht. In meinem Umkreis gibt es nicht grade viele EDV Firmen und die wollen sicher auch keinen da rumlaufen haben fr zwei Wochen. Ich habe auch die Mglichkeit in Kln mein Praktikum zu absolvieren da ich dort eine Bleibe habe also wre das kein Problem, nur da wei ich nicht an wen ich mich wenden soll. Natrlich habe ich im Internet nach Praktikumsstellen in Kln gesucht aber die meisten sind nur fr Studenten die schon viel mehr Erfahrung haben.

 Vielleicht hat ja einer von euch einen Tipp welche Firma in Kln Praktika im Informatik bereich anbietet oder vielleicht habt ihr sonstige Tipps fr mich. Ich freue mich auf eure Antworten oder sonstige Geschichten die ihr so zu erzhlen habt :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the founding of Germany in Versaille (France 1871) was a really big fuck you. 

For those that are not familiar with the German/French relationship in Europe let me explain you why it was such a big fuck you:

France and Germany were never really good friends, always fought over certain territory and both very proud of their own culture. Germany before 1871 was not a complete country, Germany at that point were a lot of small districts that were all ruled by different people. In 1870 the German-French War started and Germany (All the districts in Unions) won. That resulted in Germany being fused into one. And where did they do it? In Versailles. In the palace build by the sun king. In France. And the French people were not happy at will with that, because they were a very national country.

<TEXT> Let's talk about this video. Yes Buzzfeed sucks and yes this topic is somewhat controvers. But can we talk about how they said they are filling big arenas? I am not sure if I misunderstood it, but when was the last time female CS teams filled a big arena? And why aren't they just participating in male tournaments in the first place. Corruption and ignorance from the hosts or something would come in mind but I don't know enough about the view of female and male CSeperation in eSports.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So here is the small problem I made. I wanted to fresh install Windows 10 on the SSD and I forgot to unplug my HDD with Windows already installed on it, so now every time I boot up my PC it asks me weather I want to boot with Windows 10 or Windows 7. I will probably fix that soon though. If you want to fresh install Windows on your SSD. Plug it in, unplug the HDD with your OS, install Windows. Aaaand you're done.

If you are looking into taking the data from your current drive that has your OS on it make sure you pick a SSD with enough space for it all, or delete some data from your old Drive. There are programs that clone your old drive and put the data on your SSD. In that case, if I understood correctly. You plug in your SSD, open up the program, Pick your old drive and SSD and then clone. But I have no experience with that so you might want to look into some tutorials. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually no. I plugged it in, checked if it appears in the bios (it did). And then installed Windows on it. Just make sure you plug out your old drive (if you already have a HDD with an OS on it). Otherwise it'll ask you what OS to use when you start up your PC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heads up he is not wasting his time! He is doing something that he loves and enjoys doing and I am sure he will find awesome friends who do the same. I don't know if he is missing school or something to play XBox which is a bad thing to do, but from my experience he'll grow up just fine. My parent's gave me a PS1 for my 7th brithday (I think :S) and since then I've not stopped playing games and I am currently doing my A level and regularly meeting with friends and I've even made friends with people from other countries that I met in real life at a gaming event :D You could try to see what he is doing and maybe you'll have some interest in what he is doing and you two could spend some time together playing games. (There are games for everyone no matter of age of gender)  </TEXT>

Klar war es nur eine Frage der Zeit bis sowas auch in Deutschland passiert, und natrlich ist das nicht weniger schlimm als in Frankreich. Noch schlimmer macht es das es auf einem Weinachtsmarkt passiert ist. Jedoch sollten wir uns jetzt nicht weniger sicher fhlen und natrlich als eine Nation zusammenhalten und knnen sicher auch auf Untersttzung von Frankreich bauen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Eiffel Tower is something everyone should see in real life if they have the chance to, sadly a lot of people don't. It looks always so big in pictures and then when you see it you are just blown away. It is gigantic! Just breath taking.

Oh and for the love of god don't buy those cheap Eiffel Tower souvenirs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not sure what actually scares me. People are talking about drones, robots or AI but I can't wait to see what new technologies we're inventing. I think the thing that scares me the most is maybe some 1984 type stuff. The government using more and more technology to monitor us. It is already scary to think that someone can just watch you through your webcam and now imagine you have a house robot with a camera or someone changes some things in your personal AI program.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok so this is kind of a tricky thing and I am sorry to not directly answer your question. I've talked a lot about this with a friend of mine and we have very different opinions on this. But let's view both of the viewpoints.

Friend:
Whatever you do in the past will dramatically change the timeline. Even if you just leave the house one minute later that could change everything, maybe because of that two people don't meet, fall in love have kids and one of those kids cures cancer. All because you left the house too late. 

Mine:
Every action is a chain of previous reactions and most of the things you do will only change minor things and might only change your timeline. Let's say you sit next to a stranger on the bus and don't let him exit his stop so he has to get of the next stop. Well my theory says that his chain of events is only slightly changed so he might be a bit too late but nothing else will change, he won't get fired from his job, neither will he get hit by a car.

* Note Landesweit = Grade Countrywide
* Note Weltweit = Grade Worldwide

So you see 9% of Germany, 17% of the whole world. Which I imagine is a big part of the African countries that have internet and India(?) </TEXT>

Surely I will try to pick fair traded meat when I am living on my own but I know I won't be able to avoid mass farmed meat at all.

To the lab meat. I can see your point, but what do you think about that meat in labs having a positive effect on the environment since we won't have to cut down forests for big farms.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> DM:

Played against mousesports not the current lineup but the old with nex, Spiidi, ChrisJ, Niko and Denis. They were warming up for an event and they didn't speak but in my head I had a thing going against nex. And some other days friberg and sunnY.

You'd expect the chat to go abeshit but must of the time it is just maybe one or two persons saying "Oh look it's x " and then the chat goes quiet again or some general banter.

Pug:

Well I didn't play against a pro, but I had Karrigan and his gf on my team. We played cobble and he told us on t side "Always go b". So that is what we did. His gf awped mid but Karrigan carried us the game ez.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like the one by /u/SpartahWaffle 

It seems solid overall and with just $4 over the 800 budget pretty good! The other ones are ok as well but they safe the money to get on $800 by recommending a micro ATX motherboard, which is not only very small and looks ridiculous in a normal case, but also leaves few to no room for further upgrades in terms or more RAM or other stuff you need the PCIe slots for. Not horrible but not recommendable in a normal build. </TEXT>

Might need to add an optical drive but the site wouldn't let me :S Well I kept it a bit under $800 so you can still buy a Windows key or something else.

<TEXT> All I would ask them for is a picture with them next year ESL One Cologne. 

I am a huge NiP fan and have been since I started playing CS almost 3 years ago now. CSGO was the first CS I played and I came mainly from RPG type games or console games and my brother had played a bit CS in 2014 around the major. I did not know any of the teams but my brother said "Haha, a team named 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' won." Neither of us knew that majors are such a big thing but I could not forget the name due to how silly it sounds. Now in late 2014 my brother gifted me a skin, a Souvenir PP-Bizon Irradiated Alert with a NiP and a LDLC sticker. I thought hey why not give this game a shot? I played a lot with my brother, mostly mm tho. Then Dreamhack Winter 2014 arrived and I thought "Wow this is a really big thing!" and then I saw what team is in there, Ninjas in Pyjamas. Little fun fact here, I played the pick'em and got 96 points with only 1 team being a false choice, which was iBuyPower. So I watched all the matches after I came from school and I can remember one thing especially. The final was NiP vs. LDLC after LDLC got into the final after the Olofpass thing, and I couldn't wait for the final to beging, so finally the game starts and I am exited as hell for the whole match and my heart was beating like crazy. In the end LDLC won and I was a bit sad but then I saw, I think f0rest, hugging someone from LDLC. I think it was Shox, but I am not sure :x I will never forget that moment and after that all the other moments NiP and their fans cheered! And with them I did! Even when they were on a losing streak, a Ninja never cries but always cheers! So this year my parents and my brother gave me money to buy a ticket for ESL One Cologne and I was so happy that I would finally get to meet my great idols. The guys that motivated me to go beyond my limits and always give my best in game even when my internet is shit, but then F3 won... I was devastated.... I wouldn't meet my idols. But I had hope. Hope that I see them one day and take a picture with them and just thank them. I think being a part of such a great community as the cs community made me more confident in real life and I even met friends due to being such a NiP fan! Maybe one day I will even play against them :) .  </TEXT>

Here are the parts I picked. Now I will try to give an explanation to why I picked those parts. I chose an i5-4460 for the CPU as it is a solid CPU that I can only recommend and I highly doubt that you will need 6 cores. Motherboard changed due to CPU change (other socket). Memory could have stayed but I picked you the blue one which is a bit cheaper and fits the Mobo \:^) Now coming to the GPU. I tried to get some money of your budget for games and all that stuff that follows so I went with the GTX 1050Ti since it is a very solid card and should do the job just as fine as the GTX 960. Case stayed the same, a little tip at this point, you can take of both sides of the case for easier cable management. Power supply stayed the same tho I would have gotten a 550W if you want to upgrade further later on. I also thought about a 600W for 30 but I don't know how the quallity is and 600W would be overkill to be honest. Wireless Network Adapter... uhm.. I don't know, I don't use them I just picked a cheap one I would highly recommend using a cable if that is a possibility. Added a DVD/CD Writer because they are cheap and useful as you will likely not have the drivers on a USB-Stick.  

With the money you saved you could buy a nice keyboard and mouse. Honestly it is no waste of money to invest into a good mouse for example the Steelseries Rival 300 or Logitech G402. Keyboards don't matter that much, it is nice to have a really fancy mechanical one but as for an example at the moment I am using an old Medion one which works just as fine.

Feedback from others is appreciated as well :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Germany:

Most people in my school, cause that is the only thing that requires me to go outside to talk and listen to people, were all like the world is going to end after Donald Trump was elected. A lot of people compared him with Hitler and ranted about it. Well now from my point of view most of the students, including me, don't know jack shit about the US elections except for what the media tells us, and if you aren't watching serious news or so most of the stuff is hyped up. Also most think Hillary is a saint and would have saved all of the US. Which isn't easy to do when you basically say you want to declare war against Russia and Syria...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> See that is the problem. Solving what the prime mover behind the big bang was would be the ultimate success in science.

<TEXT> Before bullshitting all over religion etc and saying atheists rules I will just stay civil as any normal person would so.

Saying "Why can't Atheists accept that the universe was created by a non-human entity?" is like saying Why can't Christians accept that the universe was created by a non-human entity? If you have an opinion you're likely to stick to it, unfortunately that is for other things as well even when faced with facts. Coming back to the real topic it is mostly due to the fact that there is more proof for the universe being created by a big bang than by a non-human entity. As Religions are mostly based on tradition or a book it is easy to prove everything wrong what is written down there. Now you could say "But how do you want to proof me there is no god if you can't see him?", well I'd tell you "Well how about you proof me that there is no giant toilet bowl floating through space that is creating universes as it flushes." You see where I am going? Most of the stuff the church said to justify a non-human entity creating the world and everything around it was proven wrong. I am saying most of the Stuff is because I have not read e.g the whole bible so I don't know all the little stuff in there but as my example said how can you deliver a proof that there is no universe creating toilet bowl? 

But in the end it doesn't matter. You have your believe and I have mine. Why would I dictate you what you should believe in, if it isn't something as stupid as saying the earth is flat. You don't harm anyone by believing in your religion. (Before the idiots comment, no the IS does not represent the Islam) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got some uncommon habits:

* I always double check when closing something, sometimes I even run back from my car to the house to check if I locked it

* Sometimes I twitch my fingers when I walk from one place to another

* If you want to know the time I give you the exact time no rounding

* When talking to someone for the first time, or I rarely speak with I actively avoid looking into their face

* Friday is Christmas sweater Friday. Every Friday.

Edit: I also always keep one can of mountain dew on the desk near my bed.

<TEXT> I hope I don't bother you with this question, but I hope you answer it anyways. I am graduating from high school next year and I am learning Java in school and I really love programming but I always feel like I don't know where to start. I know a fair bit about the language now and we'll be doing GUIs in a few months and it is something I could see myself doing but I often feel like I won't get a job as a programmer as I don't sit at the PC all day coding. I like to do small stuff here and there but when I come home from school I often feel like shit and just want to rest so here is my question in short:

Do I need to spend all my day learning programming or how much time would you recommend to spend learning?  </TEXT>

* (About a religion exam) "I can't even know this, I have been in catholic class for 10 years, you've been in evangelical you have to know all this." //He thinks protestantism is a whole different religion. 

* "Ohh I don't know if I am able to come to your LAN party because my PC is so valuable. I can join you online from my house though." (That is not what a LAN is for...)

<TEXT> I am sorry but I have to stop you right there. I am not sure what part of Germany you are from, that might be the reason for our different experiences, but Halloween is really taking off in Germany. Seeing you speak of St. Martins day I guess you are from Bavaria, but I am not sure. 

I live in North-Rhine Westphalia and kids dress up each year and go around collecting sweets and more than 5% of houses give out sweets. I used to live in a small village, we moved to a rural area 6km away from the city, and I used to go trick or treating every year with friends and we got a lot of sweets. 

On the other hand I have never really experienced St. Martins day. Well meaning I have never given out candy to kids on St. Martins day. They all go by with their lanterns singing songs (mostly kindergarten kids) but never try to get candy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am living in Western Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia) and my grandparents are living about 15km away from me in a city called 'Burgsteinfurt' and although most of the city is partly modern today there is still the old part of the city with the houses from the middle ages. Even the streets in that part are mostly old and some of them are very narrow with the houses being closely side by side. Not sure if you are interested but a 'Furt' is the part of a river that you can cross by foot or in a vehicle. I don't know the English word for the other readers in here though.   </TEXT>

How do I prepare it? Well. Heat up the water, put the tea in, wait 3 minutes every minute more will make it taste stronger and most people don't like it that strong. Then to add sweetness you add a [''Kluntje''](http://www.clara-teeversand.de/WebRoot/Store7/Shops/61230082/4AD8/8A73/98BA/8D4D/7492/C0A8/2935/F1F4/14002.jpg) and then finally some cream.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is important that you do not try to force tactics. It is good to have a basic concept eg. (T) 3 rushing A while 2 is making noise and going for risky peaks with smokes coming in on B. Most of the time something will happen and you have to be flexible, that's why a really good game sens is a must have for a really good player. 

And a thing that I was thinking about is penalties. I haven't worked out how exactly this should look. It would include stuff like benching and if they dodge too often they'll get kicked out. And maybe small things like pay the next entry fee for a tournament alone or buy some beer for the rest of the team. 

Edit: And don't focus too much on e.g Dust II. Everyone knows Dust II and you can mostly win by raw skill and basic tactics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am by no means a professional player, nor have I ever lead a proper team. But I learned something in my last team. I was searching a team to play with to get better and maybe win small leagues and the guys I found seemed really motivated and then I got to know them better. They kinda were all chill except for the leader, he was kinda angry at his mates all the time for not doing what he expects. I got into the team as a neutral person and I told them openly how I felt about the team and the players. Without a long story I left the team after 2 or 3 weeks due to two main problems. The first one was, which they have nothing to do with, my internet was just too bad and I had to practise with a 80-200 ping which lead to me and them not being to pleased. I can't change that so I had a small break and currently I am only playing for fun. The secon problem was, that they didn't really do anything. Most of the trainings were done without a 4th or 5th due to not being avaiable. Sometimes with excuse sometimes without. Now I told them we can train with 3-4 people. We'll just do some retakes and maybe look at some things we do wrong or just general gameplay. The leader was completly against this and said we can't train with less than 5 people. One or two guys actually liked the idea of training retakes but they didn't really take it as serious but we still had some fun and I got to know them better which in a way fulfilled a bit of the mission. But in the end I felt like that not really having the motivation to show up for training is not really helping. Yes everybody has friends and family and they come first, but it is just like football practise. And I am sure if you want to watch a movie with your friends you can watch that 1 or 2 hrs later in most of the cinemas and sometimes you just have to sit there one sunday or saturday and train and not do something else. 

I am not sure if this helps you but I just wanted to show you that if you feel like things are not really how they are supposed to be talk with them and if they are not able to change ou have to change something, maybe even search a 6th guy you trust that takes a bit of your work and watches the overall team dynamics and problems etc. A neutral view is always good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't focus too much on how to get out and how to get better at the moment. Take a step back and relax a bit, maybe even take a short break from the game. There is no easy solution to this, as we are all different and some things work for person a and some for person b. I recommend stop worrying too much about how you play and try to find something that lets you have more fun playing.

For example play with a friend that is really funny or go onto a Italy server and goof around a bit. Or maybe you like surfing? Then go onto a surf map, put some muisc on, and enjoy! Don't let yourself burn out! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Following guides etc to have the perfect sens is kind of good in a way, but the perfect sens is the sens you feel the most comfortable with. A video can say you have to use 2.5 @400 but maybe you feel like playing on a higher sens e.g 3 @400. Play with your sens and get a feel of it, if you don't like it add 0.2 or substract 0.2 and play with that for a long time. And by long time I don't mean 2 or 3 dms.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok first of all, if you have the idea of fixed roles, throw them all out! A team does simply say 'x is the awper now and y is the lurker'. But I hope I can rule that out. Now you have to talk about what your motivation is. Do all players want the same? It is hard to reach one goal if everyone has something else they want to do. The problem is we don't know you guys, and your dynamic within the group. If you have the option ask others, that know you/have played a fair amount with you, what they think about the motivation in the team. 

And if you feel that you want to go pro, and the others just play casual, you have to tell them that and either they help and support you or you'll have to search a team to grow with. But I don't mean you have to leave them behind. You can still play with them and enjoy time with them just don't let them hold you back. Ok that sounded so cheesy I have to clean my keyboard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

* I will be using the PC for gaming. I am looking forward to Battlefield 1 and the beta showed me that I do need a better PC.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* My maximum budget is 750

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* I am planning on building/buying the PC as soon as possible. I got holidays at the moment so I am looking forward to doing something. 

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

* I need the Tower. I already got a better monitor and mouse. Keyboard will be coming later.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* I will be buying the parts in Germany.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* I will be reusing my monitor (BenQ sorry forgot the model and not home), keyboard (some old Medion) , mouse (Logitech G401) and I got an OS ready (Win 7).

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* I am not interested in overclocking at the moment. 

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* I was planning on including a GTX 1060  in the build if there isn't a better alternative. Edit: GTX 1060 6GB

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* I don't have a preference case.

**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* Already got Windows included :)

<TITLE> Planning a Civ V LAN. Anyone got tips and/or suggestions? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-19 01:52:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As the title already says I am planning a Civ V LAN and I would love to hear some tips and suggestions from you to make it more interesting. 


I have never planned a LAN before but wanted to do a small LAN with about 6-8 people to celebrate my birthday and the ''soon'' release of Civ VI. Now for this I thought we might play some Civ as it seems like a game you can play on a LAN for 12 hrs or something so you can finally finish a game without waiting for everybody to gather and everybody likes the game. I thought about some things like: 

* Experienced players get weak civs, not so experienced get strong        civs  
* Free for all but allowed to create pacts
* Everybody bring a flag of the civ they are playing (?)
* Civ drinking game (?)

But that is all I got so far. And as you see that is not a lot. I'd like to have some things to make the game fun and fair for everybody. So let me hear what good/unique ideas you got :)

I am currently playing with magic the first time and I saw somewhere that the Balder Side Sword is really good at +15. Now I havn't played Dark Souls in a while since my controller.

<TITLE> How I spent my 30min playing Civ 6 at the gamescom and why I am proud of what I've done </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-21 22:25:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am not really active in this sub, but a friend of mine is active so I thought hey why not give you guys an impression of what Civ 6 is. Now I am no pro in any Civ game I played one on my DS ages ago and I got about 150hrs in Civ V. I met my friend and we waited about 45min to play the game, as it was the first thing we went to. I was really exited when I got to the PC and although the mouse and keyboard were a bit too low for me, but that's only because I am above average height. So we get to play as China and it felt like I already knew basic things. I am not going into details about the politics system as I didn't really pay attention, because I set myself one mission. Conquer the city state I spawned next to. I am really impressed by the Civ 6 units. I started with slingers and warriors as basic units I could produce. So I made some slingers and warriors and killed some barbarians while I waited for the technology to make archers. After I got the archers I produced about 4 of them and walked to the city state, which I declared war in the second round, and started shooting it with arrows. It was early game so the city couldn't attack me and their units were really weak compared to my army. After nearly 30 minutes I finally managed to take the city with archers and  a lonely slinger unit (Marched in with a warrior I made about 3 rouns earlier while the city was down on health). I know it's nothing special probably gives you no idea about the game but I am happy to be one of the first or even the first one to conquer a city state in Civ 6 (if anyone was at the gamescom and played Civ 6 please tell me what day and time :) ) </TEXT>

As we are coming closer to ESL One Cologne 2016 I think we need a return of the Friend Finder. Of course Adam did it for MLG, which was really nice,  so maybe we get someone from ESL to do one. From my viewpoint it would really help, as I too go to the major but non of my friends can so I would be a lone wolf, but I want to cheer with some eSport fans and meet new people :) Pls mods bring the FF back. </TEXT>

I stated: ''The German equilibrium policy is only a byproduct of Bismarcks plan on being the political power in Europe and just a wishful thinking.''  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello fellow redditors!

I'm learning Java at school (doing my A level in math and computer science) and I have to say that I love programming. Well I got bored of doing just normal programs for school and I wanted to do something I'd enjoy doing which also makes me learn new things. I know that Android Studio uses Java and I've tried some things in but no major things just basic things. Now I got this idea and I know what I need to do if I'd do it in my Java Editor. But how do I connect that with Android Studio? Do you know any good tutorials that are good at explaining how you use certain things like e.g. one part of the app is supposed to be some kind of profile. Now I know what I need like a String for the name and stuff like that but I'm not really sure how to do such thing in Android Studios, as I am only used to my good old Java Editor. 

I'd appreciate if anyone had some really helpful and good explain tutorials. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello o/

I'm currently learning Java in school and I really love programming. I could site there for hours and hours just doing some fun little stuff. For example I did a little 'game' where I'd have to chose options from a menu and have a coin system to buy more stuff and so on. I really loved doing it and I thought that I want to make something like this for a living. Now the problem is I don't know where to start. I read that I could try to make an App and I tried using the Android Studios tutorials but they just overwhelmed me with too much stuff and some things worked differently in the new version so I was lost at some point. What are  some things you would recommend someone who doesn't know where to start from now. I know a fair bit about Java now and I am willing to learn even more. I already thought about maybe doing a little website, because why not? But I feel like that doesn't quite do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello fellow redditors!

I am 17 year old German on a trial as a blogger for team-dignitas.net and I am trying to improve my work and I want to know what you would like to know more about. 

To give you an understanding of what I am doing I'll link you one of my blogs below. Basically it is writing tutorials for newer and more experienced players as well as interview which I haven't written yet, but I would love to in the future. In the last days I've gone over my work and noticed that I don't like it, because it is not quite what I want to do week after week, and I am sure you, too don't want to read how to throw smokes every week. I thought that I might ask the people who I want to address what they would change what they would change or maybe even give me some tips as I am not an experienced writer. 

I'd appreciate serious tips and critic.

Here is one of my blogs:

<TEXT> I've beat the game some days ago and started NG+ which I didn't think would be that hard. And oh well it is. Now my question is I saw that scaling is pretty useful and I can't decide on what weapon I should use, because at the moment I use the great Great Scythe +15 but I have more STR than DEX so I figured maybe I should consider using something else before going down the hell hole called Abyss to defeat the four kings. I'd be glad if someone could help me.

These are my stats:

STR 40
DEX 31
INT 20
FAITH 25 (Yes I'm a Sunbro \\[T]/)

<TITLE> Thanks for the jolly co-op in Anor Londo ! :D </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-05 22:43:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So first off I know that there are a lot of posts about how good co-op is and I loved to read them so maybe I can give something back to the community with this. I was struggeling with O S on NG+ and farmed about 30 humanity first to summon Solairebro to help me. He was help for the first one either Smough or Ornstein but then I just got recked. After a few tries I thought to myself why not wait at the bonfire and see if anybody is there. And how nice there was someone there. I ran to the summon sign and summoned 'Chronial' he tried fighting O S two times and I kinda fucked up because I died being stupid. After the second try I summoned him again and saw another summon sign. It was 'Darksoul' and jesus he kicked ass. He had the weapon which shoots the thing from the moonlight butterfly. We ran to the giants before O S and I am not sure but I think he one-shoted one of the giants. After we cleared out the area we ran to the fog gate and prepared to kick some ass. As we three entered the room O S tried to welcome us with a faceslap, but no not this time! We dodged like heros and just went storming onto Smough he died pretty quickly and nobody got seriously hurt untill that point. I was quite happy, because on my first playtrough I killed Ornstein first so I didn't get his armor but now I had a chance to get his armor. It was an intense fight and sadly Chronial got hit by Ornsteins spear and died instantly. With a man down we kinda knew what to do without even speaking. I lured Ornstein onto me and dodged his attacks while Darksoul shot at him with his spear. Everytime he got close to Darksoul I ran in his direction and jumped at Ornstein with my Great Scythe. After some minutes we had him down and I was so happy that I finally beat Ornstein last and got his armor (which I am wearing right now). I can't be more thankful to my two heros :) Without you I'm not sure if I would be able to remain human and not hollow after endless attempts. So thanks for the jolly co-op and I can only say if there is a summon sign check it out and try it, maybe you'll have as much fun as I did. Praise the sun \[T]/

And here is a picture of us at the fog gate :)

Edit: I won the fight now :D I used a combo of all your things. Medium armor, small shield (Buckler), parries, doging and blocking him wiht the enviroment. It was a close fight but I made it :) Praise the sun! \[T]/ </TEXT>

The tutorial teaches how to let the game render stuff, player movement, camera etc. While watching I wondered what a game designer and what a game programer does. I tried to search stuff about it on the internet but most of the sites don't really go into detail. What code does the designer write for example? Or what does he do?

<TEXT> Here is my code I'm not sure why it's not working first I thought it is because I forgot to add repaint() but does not work with it either. (There is a new frame opening to check if the button works)

<TEXT> I'm really thinking about why people joked about Ant-Man being in the movie just by shadows and stuff like that. I mean if you watch the scene after the credits of Ant-Man (movie), you see that Falcon says ''he knows someone''. Someone please explain. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Did Hitler really help Germany out of it's great depression after WW I? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I was reading a discussion today about Hitler not all being bad and the point of that person was that he helped germany out of depression with work and a growing economy. I couldn't quite agree with his opinion, because from what I learned in history at school it is not the work of Hitler that the econmy started to get better again. And I know he build some 'Autobahnen' which is of course work for a lot of people but if I remember correctly while Hitler was controlling Germany a lot of people starved in the winter because there was not enough food and it was really expensive (don't quote me on this one I'm not sure if I remember correctly). And as Adam Smith explained people take advantage of each other to gain advantages theirselfs. So my guess would be that Hitler did not care about how many people work in Germany but rather that they build him 'Autobahnen' for the war and that would give them work so they don't care about what he is doing. Plus he destroyed the german economy later, because he spent so much money on the war. I had a great statistic but I can't find it anymore. So did Hitler really help Germany or was it due to someone/something else? I'm really looking forward for an answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello,
I'm currently working on a hostage map and I would love to get some feedback form you guys. I'd like to know what you think of the layout. Unfortunately I couldn't test it 5v5 and I can only assume how the playstyle is. The map is missing clippings and all stuff like that (as mentioned on the workshop page). I'll leave you an imgur link with all the pictures and a link to the workshop page in case you want to check it out ingame. (The map was inspired by the roman city  Augusta Treverorum)

<TEXT> I really like how the pins in the loading screen look but there are no vaultboy pins as Fallout merch. I'd really like Bethesda to make some. If you don't know which pins I mean I'll link a picture of one and I'll link a strawpoll.
