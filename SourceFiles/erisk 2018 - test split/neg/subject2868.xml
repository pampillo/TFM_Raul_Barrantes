<TEXT> I agree, and to me that's a huge bummer. 

Can you guys recommend any artist collectives/movements that are gaining steam?

<TEXT> I'm genuinely glad you and others were able to experience that for a while. 

I guess I should be doing my research on Asia and South America... maybe somewhere super far out in Queens. I've heard Berlin is the closest thing in Europe. 

I'm fortunate in that I make enough money to live pretty much anywhere, so I guess it's more about finding the right people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the reply. I agree with your examples and have lived in places like that - this will sound elitist but I found the art/writing scenes to be more amateurish than I expected. Maybe the problem is that I didn't find the right people - so maybe a better question is, **are there any collectives out there that are wildly talented but not necessarily that famous yet?** It's more about the network of people, they could be living in Nowheresville.

Maybe there are examples in Asia, Africa, and South America that I'm just not aware of. 

And finally, to your point, I think a big part of the change is the internet/telecom - people aren't necessarily forced to congregate to exchange ideas, so movements become more diffuse and harder to recognize. It's a lonelier world in some ways.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the answer. The point of drilling is to learn a movement. Going HAM in drills is asinine - that's not drilling, it's sparring (positional sparring I guess).

<TEXT> 100% this. Grappling clubs in college can be straight-up bonkers. All the variation in styles and backgrounds coming together along with relatively young ages and less oversight, it can be a wild environment. 

I think starting out in that type of club made me a much more well-rounded grappler. I'm comfortable dealing with spazzes because I've seen just about EVERY type of bad behavior. You quickly develop a very safe and protected game that translates well to tournaments and self-defense.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Happened to me twice - both times when I was a white belt rolling against visiting purples. Though I sucked in certain areas (still do) I had been working hard on my A-game and just caught them. 

Ryan Hall says in a DVD that if a white belt does a technique perfectly, it's no different than a black belt doing it perfectly - it's gonna work. 

I also happen to have a very old-school style and simply dont relinquish an advantage after I get it. Build up enough little advantages and you're going to submit them even if they're good and you suck (overall on average)

This is overkill but to be extra nice, maybe for a while try to match people's pace vs. setting the tempo and see how that goes. I got tapped more when I started doing this but it also allowed me to explore more areas of my game (escapes, guard retention, etc.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually not correct. Sudden mechanical pressure on the carotid artery activates baroreceptors that usually monitor your blood pressure. They interpret the choking pressure as a sudden rise of blood pressure and this triggers a reflex that causes blood vessels to dilate to reduce it, even though your overall blood pressure has not actually risen. This reflex is actually what causes syncope (unconsciousness) at least initially. That's why BJJ chokes cause unconsciousness so quickly - in fact there's plenty of blood still in the brain to otherwise maintain consciousness  (at least for longer than you might expect.)

<TEXT> no. his own actions say it. as in: i am judging him purely based his own self-professed actions, and also based on straightforward facts (comp video of him as a blue belt, promo video to "brown belt," etc.) 

you clearly have some stake in this and are interpreting the facts differently. i cant blame you for that. but you can't tell me these are not facts. 

like i said, there's a sucker born every minute, but nobody wants to admit they're one of them. 

there's a simple thing you could do to convince all of us, and that is post a video of ari rolling where he shows technical proficiency (asking his permission of course). he would have done this by now to clear his name if he could.

FTFY. His brown belt promotion video is one of the funniest bjj-related vids ive ever seen. Absolute joke. 

You could very generously say that him misrepresenting his rank was all just a big misunderstanding and youthful error. But the fact that he owned his own gym while getting wrecked by white belts in competition is hilarious.

<TEXT> +1 to this. i think the typical signals for who is good can be deceptive, but this one is almost always true. 

take top position for example. 

people who think they're real good will sort of lean back, lazily look around for a submission, maybe talk to someone on the sidelines if they're really clowning you. when bottom guy moves, they surf them to the other side, etc.  

people who are actually real good have their head glued down the whole time, they already know what sub they're going for and are constantly inching toward it from the beginning. there is absolutely no space. they dont have to surf on you because you cant move without breaking your own neck on the crossface. the soul is being sucked out of you. a feeling of pure futility takes over. you had no chance. they were glued to the position they wanted from the beginning split second.  </TEXT>

The Electric Chair used to be my #1 highest percentage move, and is still one of them, but I don't use Eddie's setups anymore. I find his setups really expose your neck for the crossface and other very bad things because of how far you have to reach, even in the best of circumstances. 

I personally think you'll have an easier time and take less damage if you go for it using some of Ryan's dogfight-like setups rather than Eddie's usual setups. Especially if you dont have super long arms.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Happy to help! 

Your MMA coach sounds pretty good. If you're interested in self defense, honestly I would just casually ask him for tips once in a while - focused on what types of moves should be your go-to for self-defense situations. This will be things like simple/safe takedowns (e.g., basic single-leg, or double underhooks to trip from the back), how to protect your face with your hands, and how to be disciplined in your base and footwork. EDIT: And breakfalls. Seriously breakfalls are the MOST important thing in my experience, second only to having a good base/sprawl so you don't just get bum-rushed over. 

That's all the average person needs for self-defense. I'm concerned that the HJJ would be a waste of your time at best, or at worst it will dilute your focus for what's actually useful when you end up in a self-defense situation. Self defense is more about a mindset (e.g., run away from guns and knives) than it is about a specific set of moves.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a great question and I'm sorry to see that your original post has been down-voted. This is a BJJ forum, so no question you will get a bias in favor of BJJ. But the thing to realize is that you'll also get a bias in favor of wrestling and catch (CACC). The reason being that they are proven to work. So that's probably why the HJJ question didn't go over too well. 

To your question about knowing if it's legit MMA, it's pretty hard to answer without more info. What's the background of the folks teaching it? Huge red flag if it's the same people who teach everything else. 

If the MMA instructor teaches grappling, do you know their background or lineage? If it has never once come up casually, that's not a great sign. Not that people should be bragging about it, but generally you know if someone started as a D1 wrestler or something becuase it's just naturally part of their bio. 

EDIT: Adding more helpful advice - from what you've told us, I think you'd be better off looking for one of the following:

* A cheap Judo club

* A boxing gym

* A cheap wrestling club

* A serious muay thai gym

You're generally going to get more mileage out of a place that only does one thing because they typically have more and more consistent classes.

But I feel that Eddie is really limiting its potential by using it to put a spotlight on his fighters, some of whom are way overrated. I have nothing against Nate Orchard, seems like a good guy and promising fighter, but he is astoundingly over-hyped. 

I know it's not realistic to expect that he wouldnt include his own fighters, but I would love to see Eddie make more room for higher-level grapplers and not focus so much on promoting the affiliation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I apply heavy crossface pressure (shoulder of justice) from side control, then with my other hand, I mess with their far wrist as if going for a kimura. 

Generally folks will fight hard to keep that elbow tight to their side, because doing so blocks the kimura. However, it also tends to leave their neck wide open. So while they're thinking about the kimura, I just switch my crossface into the N/S choke position and circle-step to N/S from side control. 

People walk themselves into this sub constantly, because them defending the kimura properly is actually what gives you the opportunity to snatch the N/S choke.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I interpreted this vid more as demonstrating a fundamental concept than a specific move you want to drill. Floating on your opponent is key to high-level guard passing, and this is a nice demonstration of the float in action. 

I do most of my passing like this, and in my experience, the float helps because if the bottom guy moves toward my back, it's easier to feel this coming and react if I'm floated vs. trying to hang back like most people do. It's making him carry your weight and falling through the cracks vs. trying to find a way around. 

I recommend the following for a better explanation of what you see in this video:

* Jeff Glover is a master of this - check out his neat stability ball vids

* Ryan Hall guard passing DVD

* Marcelo has a nice DLR pass that involves floating in the opposite direction (backstepping) </TEXT>

By my own estimation I roll at about 30% of max on average, maybe 50% in tournaments. The only time I would even approach 70-80% is when I have to finish - specifically: in a tournament, with a sub locked in, down on points, with only a few seconds left.

<TEXT> this is absolutely true, generally speaking. however, just to add to /u/kyuz's point, your last line of defense (or one of them) if someone blows by your seated guard is to sort of do a half-backroll up onto your shoulder-blades to bring your knees to your shoulders, closing off the space he's passing into. at the same time, you put your hands on the mat to help you spin to square back up. 

so yeah, you definitely want to sit up at first, but if he's dancing around you, try the backroll to reguard.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely the biggest culprit for more serious neck injuries, at least in my experience, is people getting accidentally dropped on their head because they were trying to submit from guard and didn't let go, or didn't let go on a controlled way. They didn't get slammed, just stubbornly held on and then accidentally slipped off, or the guy stumbled. Gotta let go if you get picked up. 

The other way people get serious neck injuries is trying to double leg (or head-outside single) while their head is stuck in a guillotine. This is not as common-sense as the example above, so definitely something to watch out for. This is why folks need to learn proper takedowns even if they don't do much standup.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree 100%. If they make a huge push, it's a lot easier. 

If they are pushing just enough to maintain space while moving well, agree that's much better technique, so a lot more finesse is required. I find if I'm being patient, circling with them while "floating" on their frame, my weight alone will be enough to eventually kill the frame OR bait them into pushing harder so I can deflect it. Against our best people though, that's still not always enough. 

So all-in-all, I completely agree that the bigger move is sometimes needed, especially if you're in a lower weight class than your partner and he moves well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's more reliable than jumping over the legs or trying to dive for a leg lock.

Yes, and I would also add - the simple hip switch you describe is also more reliable than trying to circle-step to North/South. A lot of folks are suggesting North/South, and I agree with /u/cwrestler141 that forcing them to readjust their frame is good, but one shouldn't have to make such big moves to do it. 

Personally I don't like the North/South transition in principle. Somebody with really good guard frames and retention will probably be able to capitalize on all that space. In principle, the top guy has the advantage of gravity and mobility, so there are very few situations when the top guy should have to make big movements.  

So I also prefer the hip switch you describe. But to take it to the next level, I would also suggest seeing if you can make the hip drop an even smaller movement (e.g., so no recovery is necessary) while still creating enough of an angle to deflect his post. Especially on top, I'm always looking to use the smallest movement possible that still achieves the desired goal, since space and movement benefit the bottom guy so much more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If he's stiff-arming your head/shoulder and/or blocking your crossface arm: do what /u/chokingmn says. 

If he's stiff-arming my hip, I like to use Marcelo's solution: swim my far knee around his arm and pin it to the mat. You can do it in two different ways: drive your knee inside his arm and then pin it to the mat, or drive your knee over his arm and then trap his arm between your armpit and thigh. 

I cant remember which Marcelo vids show this, but if you search for Marcelo's passing you'll find it. I find this has a higher success rate than rolling my hips against his wrist. But what they all have in common is "deflecting" his arm out of the way. He is doing you a favor by locking his arm out - when it's locked out, it's a single "piece" that you can deflect out of the way by switching your hips slightly. People who are really good will only stiff-arm for a split second to maintain space long enough to set up hip movement/reguarding. So at a higher level you will have to worry less about the stiff arm and more about the movement that follows it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That makes sense - glad to hear Eddie teaches a more legit version. I'd still encourage you to use your R hand for the knee tap instead of the ankle so you don't have to reach as far. Video 1 (above) is a nice example. 

Sadly, what you see in Video 2 on the other hand is way too common: scrubs giving 10th Planet a bad name by putting out laughably bad instructional videos when they have no business teaching.  

Especially since you train MMA it's 10x more important to test your A-game escapes when strikes are involved (and when people are generally being more aggressive, better wrestlers, etc.) In addition to the knee tap, I recommend the single leg low mat finish, since that will keep you safer in MMA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxjiuZWXvIE

To get this move from half guard, you're going to come up and get whizzered, then you sit back and grab the front of his quad by the knee instead of keeping your deep underhook on the body. You already have his leg trapped because you were in half guard. Then you tabletop his foot on your own thigh and run him over that way. This is far superior for MMA because there's no way you'll get hit - you have a better angle and more weight on him, and if he lets go at any point to strike, he'll fall right over. Usually into a fully-flattened back mount.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, so my thoughts are:

Video 1 is good technique and I would **not** call this the old school. This is just a good ol' knee tap from the whizzer and works great. I use it all the time.

Video 2 is definitely Eddie's Old School, and in my opinion it's a bad technique when done like this. you're absolutely right that you SHOULD release the lockdown to push into them, but for some reason people teach it the way it is in this video (keeping the lockdown and reaching with your arm) which is a terrible idea. 

I'm glad it helped. Feel free to send me tape any time, or PM me with questions, and I'll do another analysis for you.

<TEXT> OK yeah - a couple minor variations make all the difference here. 

The knee tap from dogfight is totally legit, especially if you let go of the lockdown and get up on your full base. Keep doing it. I would not call that the Old School. Here's a decent video of what I mean for the leg position that works well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kx5qdrX5q8 t=48

Where people get into trouble is when they do it like this - this is the Old School I'm talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnZhwPpf29Y t=101

Basically, in this video he does a good job getting up on his arm for base, but then he awkwardly dives/reaches for the ankle while maintaining his lockdown, giving up all the ground he won by getting on his base elbow. This is the move, but it's just such an awful idea to do it this way. 

Against anybody halfway decent, they are going to have steady pressure on that whizzer. As soon as the bottom guy reaches for the ankle, that steady pressure will immediately flatten him back out because he voluntarily gave up his basing arm. Also, since the top guy already has a whizzer, the bottom guy reaching is putting himself in fantastic position to get darced or guillotined (the common theme is that your head WILL get caught). 

Even if he gets the top guy's ankle, it's super easy to sprawl out if you have heavy hips and a decent whizzer. From there there are tons of options for the top guy - forearm in neck and pummel for underhook, forehead under the guy's chin to keep him flattened, etc. etc. 

So what makes the knee tap good and the old school shitty? The knee tap keeps you in good position throughout the whole sequence (good base, straight spine, tight arms) while the Old School basically requires you to get yourself out of position (arms out in space, legs tied up, voluntarily giving up base). That's ultimately why I think the Old School is a garbage move, but your knee tap from dogfight is just fine.

<TEXT> You're absolutely right - the Old School is often used to set up the Electric Chair. I used that game for years, and it certainly works great for Eddie. 

However, in my very humble opinion, even though it does work, the way people use this combo is ill-conceived. I'll do my best to explain: Locking down your legs and using your one arm to either pull his base leg out (old school) or wrench it over you (electric chair) is a very inefficient way to get under him and sweep, even when you account for the whip up. 

Don't get me wrong: it absolutely works some times - it works for Eddie and it worked for me for years. My point is that there are just far better options when you're in that situation to get to the Electric Chair or Deep Half that don't involve reaching for his leg, Old School style. 

I strongly recommend watching Ryan Hall's Deep Half Guard DVDs if you want to take your half guard to the next level, even if you keep using the lockdown/electric chair. Ryan shares much more effective ways to get underneath that minimize the chance you'll get your head caught - I think you'll have much better luck with these than you will with the Old School. 

The Old School is just that - old. It comes from a time in BJJ when the half guard was considered a stalling position halfway to getting your guard passed where you triangle your legs and hold on for dear life. Several innovators came along (like Gordo) who turned the half guard into a totally viable position that people actively want to pull. They introduced far better options to get underneath, which have taken over at the elite level. This is partly why we now call sweeps like that "Old School."

I won't get into a style vs. style argument because I don't believe in that, but my honest advice to you as my BJJ bro is to retire the Old School and instead learn some moves that let you use your hips more efficiently and involve fighting up to your base, like the Twist Sweep, or getting up to the Dogfight. Against guys who are good on top, crunching up and reaching is going to stop working really fast.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For sure! Rolling with Ryan Hall feels like this. He is not heavy (145 or something?) but he puts ALL of his weight on you, and puts that weight exactly where it needs to be to stop you from moving effectively. 

When I say he puts all of his weight on you, I mean literally ALL. His balance is so good that he will just surf on people (i.e., no part of his body is touching the mat). It's unbelievably exhausting and demoralizing in the most awesome way possible. It really makes you think critically about the right way to move on the bottom.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not that it doesn't work, it's just not optimal when you consider the whole situation of bottom half guard. If you like to use the Old School sweep, I recommend trying the following drill/experiment:

Tell your partner "I'm going to go for the Old School sweep and I just want you to block me from doing it however you can, especially by crossfacing. Don't even try to pass, just see if I can do it."

If they have any level of competency on top, or halfway decent crossface, there's almost no chance you will sweep.  /u/erangalp identified the same issue below - reaching for the Old School and getting flattened. It's just a suboptimal approach to sweeping in general. If you want to sweep, you create movement and unbalance, you don't just lay down and reach for his base and hope you can pull out his base before he smears you into the mat. 

From any guard, if you don't create movement to unbalance and make him occupy his hands and readjust his base, you're going to spend a LOT of time just smashed into the mat and flattened against anybody halfway decent. That's why I discourage people from getting into the habit of attempting the Old School, despite the fact that it can work and looks intuitive.  </TEXT>

When I start a roll with blue belts I know, from situp guard, sometimes I'll just push them to see if they'll fall over. Sometimes they do, but even if they don't, if they respond with forward momentum they'll fall right into my armdrag. 

Try goofy stuff on white belts. Kick out their base foot with your foot. If you're on top, stand on them like a surfboard and see how they get out. Adding a little bit of clowning has actually helped me in weird ways, including with staying active.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Same here, I have BIG problems with pausing, assertiveness, finishing sweeps, scrambles, etc. The best advice I can give is to flow roll with a smaller, calmer, but seasoned blue belt, and just constantly focus on removing those pauses. 

At one point I set up an experimental drill like this: i told a good training buddy that if I stop at any point to think or weigh options, I am going tap and start over, counting it as a "loss." tried it a couple times and suddenly the pauses were gone! I find myself being a lot more active now, just naturally pushing and pulling a lot more to test the waters here and there, and the windows of opportunity just seem so much more obvious now. sweeps just seem to happen and my training partners tell me it's a lot less telegraphed and predictable. removing the analysis paralysis caused an immediate, noticeable jump in my success rate (though i got subbed a bit more at first) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a happy drunk and you're my favorite /r/bjj commentator, so you get comments on your comments. Comment the first:

My halfguard posture is an active problem. Sometimes I remember and keep my back straight, sometimes I don't and this guy had me thrown off of my gameplan enough that I reverted to hunching up and trying to get under him instead of playing long range halfguard.

So, it might be less of a posture problem and move of a movement problem. I look at it this way: in the guard, you can't just latch on and go for one or the other (distance or close range). You gotta be pushing and pulling constantly. Your body as a whole has two fundamental movements: full extension (like a deadlift or the first part of a clean and jerk) and full flexion (like the very bottom of a squat). If you want to keep good posture and reliably sweep people who are legitimately good on top, you're going to need to move between both full-body extension and flexion. That's what will create the off-balancing that allows for sweeps. If you keep moving in that way while protecting your neck, the sweeps just kind of happen and the good posture takes care of itself. 

EDIT: Comment the second:

Dude already had my head, which is why I went for the sweep. I was hoping he would let go if I started to sweep him, but he never did. Even when I'm on top of half guard he never loosened up on my head enough for me to clear it and complete the pass.

Totally hear you - this used to be a big problem for me, which is why I'm so vocal about it. If your head is caught, I still say don't try to sweep from bad position. Fix the bad position first, then try to sweep. Forcing him to post is the only way you're gonna free your head, so you gotta bridge R and bridge or twist sweep L in quick succession. He doesnt even have to post his whole hand - against the brown and black belts at my gym I can only get them to barely post an elbow for a split second, but that's enough! From there, swim your hands back in, then start working your sweeps from good position. 

Edit 2: Comment the third: 

 It definitely didn't feel like there was time to attempt anything between me tabling up and him stepping around to my back.

Drillers are killers. A lot of the stuff I called out for you is stuff I'm actively working on right now too - this included. Something about turtling up makes me hesitate too. The granby from turtle is a good one to try, but pick your favorite.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, on to Video 2. 

00:17 Your posture is far better from the very beginning. I think you are feeling a lot more confident because you know the guy, and that actually shows very obviously in your posture. I bet you have a terrible poker face. You looked scared of the guy in Video 1. 

00:22 Genuinely excellent shot! Oh that was your buddy. Well, not much you could have done after that. 

00:29 Really nice active guard and good guard retention movement. 

00:40 Opponent now Schaubs, fearful of your scootery

00:48 Your guard is getting passed too easily relative to your overall skill level. Here this happened because you got lazy with the scoot for a split second. If you're going to play situp guard in no-gi, you absolutely must move forward at all times. If he gets out of range (which for me means I can no longer reach him with a butterfly hook at his ankle) you need to recognize the pass is coming. Bail to plan B like this: do a half-backroll motion to close off the space between your knees and elbows and to get your guard back in play, place your hands on the mat, and roll up onto your shoulders. Your hands on the mat will let you spin way faster than he can dance around you. And closing off your knee-to-elbow space will buy you time to get a guard going. 

1:10 good assertive guard pull - I'd say it was luck of the scramble here that got you passed 

1:20 haha his kesa gatame sucks, but your defense sucks more. swing your legs right to left and use that momentum to jerk your R elbow down to the mat. framing on his face is very old school and really just doesnt work if you don't combo it with leg/hip movement. 

1:43 bored and fast-forwarding...

2:04 sick arm triangle setup by your buddy, but terrible positional control when he got it. he needs to drop his hips and settle. then he uses it to go to mount? silly. 

2:40 your own arm triangle defense is what's keeping you in the arm triangle now. don't just "answer the phone" - you need to flare your elbow out so that your humerus creates a frame in his neck. and then as soon as you feel his head rise up a bit (which it did multiple times) you need to jack your elbow down to the mat, then you're out

3:03 OK seriously you're literally out of the arm triangle, just move your arm and you're out. jesus. 

3:10 you got out and then put yourself back in, prioritizing the frame to defend the crossface. why? bad trade. 

3:41 way to completely kill your own hips with the lockdown half guard. trying to lockdown in reverse kesa is just delaying the inevitable. do you know the twist sweep? step 1: let go of the lockdown because it sucks. step 2: swing both legs hard to your R and or stomp both feet on the side of his knee. this will move his trapped leg and force him to post. step 3: if that doesnt sweep him, shoot your R leg in for a butterfly hook and get to butterfly guard

4:00 aww he's a good friend

4:16 lazy situp guard. move forward or people are going to blow past you. 

4:30 you did a beautiful DLR guard pull and then didn't bother to protect your neck. I can't stress this enough: defending your neck is priority 1 in guard because you really can't do anything of value if you're getting violently smeared into the mat with a crossface. in my recent lazy years, I pass people all day by ignoring what they're doing with their legs in guard and go straight for the crossface. almost without exception, no matter what guard they're attempting, i try to crossface. if i get it, I pass 99% of the time, because it totally cripples them. 

4:37 you're defending well but not taking opportunities when the window presents itself. Case in point: you could get your elbow to the mat to stop this kesa before it starts, but instead your settling into the position and thinking about framing. stop it. if your arms are relatively safe, you need move your hips before anything else. 

5:00 laziness. if you're not going to bridge, at least swing your legs back and forth to create small spaces and force him to adjust. it takes less energy than a big bridge but can create just as much space. 

5:09 you get clowned. your arm was tight to defend but you allowed your elbow to cross the midline just enough to get wrapped up. 

5:43 what is it with you and the lockdown? your hips are totally free! you need your legs out of that stupid lockdown so you can bridge and shrimp to escape - you're just delaying the inevitable again. 

Final thoughts: As above, you have great fundamental sub defense but you need to trust it long enough to start working actual reversals and escapes. You REALLY need to protect your head and neck more, but even when you avoid the smash for a few seconds to survive, you then look like you have absolutely no plan after you defend the first, second, and third sub attempts. You need to convert on that defense!  

It also looks like you have no plan in half guard, kesa, and side control. Why are you not bridging or at least swinging your legs to create some space? If you're going to grab a lockdown, USE IT. Or better yet, stop going for it, because you need to remember to bridge and shrimp a LOT more than you're doing now, and the lockdown encourages stagnation. 

Keep the confidence up and remove the pauses from your game - my comments may not fully reflect this, but you are a beast!

<TEXT> Already drunk, stay tuned please...

Edit 1: Video 1: First impressions. Haircut motherfucker, get you one. 

Edit 2: Video 1: 00:28 Ever heard of Judo? How about grip fighting?

Edit 3: Video 1: 2:00 Are you for real? Please stop doing the Old School sweep, it's garbage. Why? The exact reason it caused a scramble for you - reaching with your R arm got your head caught. Priority #1 is to PROTECT YA NECK in half guard. You also locked down your hips unnecessarily. Next time, post with your R arm instead and hip into him to force a reaction. I want you fighting up toward your base, not trying to sweep from your back. 

Edit 4: Video 1: 2:28 Opponent felt bad for you and gave up superior position. You now have top half guard. 

Edit 5: Video 1: 2:40 Checking the time - at this point I would like to point out that you have spent the entire match hunched over. Posture dude. Fight your arms inside, arch your back hard, bump to both sides, do whatever you can to get that spine straight. Let's see if posture improves as video continues. 

Edit 6: Video 1: 2:57 You did all that work to get to turtle and then completely half-assed it from there. Your opponent has awful top turtle control and obligingly opened his arms for a competition eternity as he circled, but you did nothing. Why not at least pretend you might granby roll?

Edit 7: Video 1: 3:05 OK I get it now, you're a counter-fighter. Nice job taking your back away from his sternum to mess up his back control. He should be toast from here, really should not be able to recover good back control. Let's see what you can make out of this. 

Edit 8: Video 1: 3:05 - 3:35 Oh you moved your hand, thank god. For 30 seconds there I thought you were unconscious or dead. You know, 30 seconds ago you were basically out of his back control, but you gave up and conceded the position. Dont do that k?

Edit 9: Video 1: 4:03 Look where his head is. LOOK AT IT. His head is way out in space and his hands are periodically letting go to gripfight. At any point you could have jacked your L arm down toward the mat and significantly improved your position, despite the body triangle. 

Edit 10: Video 1: 4:19 His face says "I can't believe I won - was it really that easy?"

Edit the 11th: Video 1: Final impressions. OK, two things. 

1) As /u/gunslinger_006 says below, your technique is looking great (especially for defenses and sub counters) but you're just not being assertive and active enough. You're making it too easy for him when you're on the defense by not using motion to create space and force him to readjust. So what does that mean? TRUST your good defense and TRUST that it will still be there when you then create movement to escape. Don't wait to be ready to move toward the escape, just trust your defense and go. Was it partly a cardio issue? You need to take the pauses out of your game and let your game flow - and trust your defense is good enough not to get subbed. 

2) If there's one move you need to learn it's the wrestling single-leg LOW FINISH ON THE MAT. Here's a mediocre youtube instructional (you can definitely find better): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfr0UomatdU
You're just latching on to his leg in both half guard and turtle - you need to CIRCLE STEP while keeping the pressure on him if you want to make anything happen from here. He's still in superior position from top half guard and top turtle, but ONLY UNTIL you can cut an angle on him, then you're winning. 

Overall, I give you an F+ for effort. JK, good stuff. Watching the rest now... </TEXT>

<TEXT> that student (who I have always kept my distance from)

That's an odd thing to say. Why have you always kept your distance from one of your fellow training partners?

Until she's willing to say who she's accusing and what they've done, it's just piss in a firepit to me.

Yeah? Why's that? Sounds like she only requested info about the gym's harassment policy, which it's apparently required to have by law. So what does naming and shaming her alleged assailant have to do with it? It's absolutely her right not to name the person. Maybe she doesn't think they deserve to be nationally shamed. That's a totally separate issue from whether the gym has a harassment policy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lots of classic fallacies and misinformation in your argument, but I'll just share my 2 cents. In every poll I've ever seen of the "best instructors in all of BJJ," Ryan Hall's name was included. People on /r/bjj and other forums ask all the time about best instructional videos, and Ryan is #1 the majority of the time. 

I've informally talked to black belt instructors at both BJJ and MMA gyms across the U.S. and in the past 5 years I'd say 90% of the time the conversation about "people who most influenced their game" comes up, they mention Ryan as at least one of the people, along with Saulo and Marcelo. 

I could care less about Ryan as a person, and I barely use any elements of his game, just telling you for a fact that you're wrong. </TEXT>

Long story short: if people can do goofy stuff like pressure points while in your guard, it's because your guard is not active enough yet. If you have an active guard (moving your hips, and pushing/pulling with your legs and arms at the very least) they will be forced to occupy their arms to maintain balance and regain proper position. 

You don't have to be pulling off sick sweeps and subs yet - just off-balancing them with movement will be enough to keep you pretty safe. Just keep moving.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lots of people who are new to BJJ have a very similar experience. They start doing BJJ at whatever gym is nearby, but then quickly hear about 10th Planet because of the marketing (Joe is a big part of this). 10th Planet ends up sounding like this revolutionary system that is "outside the mainstream, man," but poised to change everything, if only people would give it due credit. 

Except... that's the same narrative we've been hearing for 10+ years and that certainly hasn't happened. Don't get me wrong: Eddie is the man and 10th Planet gyms train solid techniques just like plenty of other gyms, but those other gyms don't market it as if it's going to change the world. Keep an open mind, try lots of things, and do what works for you. 

No matter what you do, for the love of god, don't become one of the typical 10th Planet internet fanboys, and/or the guy who interrupts class to do a white belt seminar on rubber guard in the corner. Especially the latter. Don't be that guy.  </TEXT>

In a lot of schools I visit, every blue belt seems to pull out crazy berimbolos, rubber guard, exotic lapel guards, etc. Against purple belts and below, the vast majority of guard techniques can be stuffed by simply maintaining a straight spine and low, wide base. You don't need a vast library of counters, just posture, base, and balance.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently realized that one of the biggest things that destroys immersion for me ("pulls me out of the game") is poor animation quality. Especially if the game is otherwise visually appealing, crappy animations just ruin it. I've since read up on this and found that unless you can pay for quality Motion Capture, creating good animations from scratch is incredibly difficult. 

I know Dragon Age 2 has been beaten to death across the internet, but it's still the best example I can think of for this. Characters swing huge weapons as if they have no weight or even air resistance. To me, it ends up looking like a poor knockoff of anime. Worse though, the animations are jerky and abrupt, and don't seem to "loop" properly (ending where they next need to begin). 

What are some other decent games that suffer from poor animation quality? Does it matter a lot to anyone else, or is it just me? </TEXT>

For folks who get to the purple or brown belt level, especially those who are not natural athletes, the amount of pain and (what some would consider) humiliation, and lapses of confidence that go into that journey are unbelievable. 

They will get beat up repeatedly in ways that might be considered humiliating in other contexts, but because of the culture of BJJ it's all part of the learning process. Think about the hundreds of times, big and small, these guys had to pick themselves up, bump fists again, and just keep going. 

The very act of tapping out, bumping fists and starting again is sacred; the heart and soul of BJJ. Those are the moments in which those poor-to-mediocre athletes are taking the biggest steps to becoming future brown and black belt monsters.  </TEXT>

 if I wanted to, I could have hurt him much worse

Maybe he deserved a little discomfort in return?

At least I had the balls to stand up to him...I was **so angry I temporarily lost control,** that's all.

**I went too far** not letting go after he went to sleepy land, but **this guy did deserve the dose of nyquil I gave him.** 

**I've been choked out myself more than once,** and I'd definitely take that over having my body slammed into the ground by a guy who benches twice my body weight.

I **lost control** and **couldn't stop** choking him.

OP: BJJ is an amazing sport/culture and can help people get through a lot of bad times in their lives (PTSD, etc.) But you have serious anger problems. When people train with each other, there is a social contract that says "my safety is in your hands." You really need to work out your issues before putting other people's safety in your hands again, because you clearly can't trust yourself. What your partners did, while extremely disrespectful, is pretty irrelevant here. The "justice" they deserve is a separate issue. You can control whether you put yourself in a position to hurt people again. I hope you will deal with your issues before you trust yourself with someone else's safety again.  </TEXT>

Marcelo is pinning the guy's other leg to the mat just enough to prevent either of those from happening, so the omoplata will be too loose and easy to shake off. 

When I do this pass, instead of standing up, I replace my elbow with my same-side knee to pin his leg down even more. I have trained with sharp rubberguard players for years, I use this same pass every time and have never once gotten swept or submitted from RG.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good question! I neglected a couple things in my first response. 

It's all about the push and pull. 

**The push:** If he leans back, you can literally just pop him in the shoulders with both hands (or hip bump sweep if you have a bigger opening). This makes him want to drop his posture. Alternatively you can just pop your hips into extension to make him feel off-balanced backwards. Imagine doing a deadlift against his body. Loading your hips like this sets up "the pull"

**The pull:**In your example sounds like his posture is already relatively low (but not low enough to put him in real danger) and refusing to move. This is where you want to pull. But you don't want to just yank him onto you. Some details:

* Always pull with your arms and legs at the same time, one big motion as if you're going to throw him all the way over your body and backroll

* If you popped your hips into extension as I described, you can do a much bigger pull 

* Don't just pull him onto you - when you pull him forward, you should hip out at the last second so he kind of falls "past" you. In other words, you pull him forward but then move yourself out of the way at the last second, so he drops into the "hole" beside you. This is where armdrags start to work really well.

* EDIT: One more detail. Every time you pump your hips to pull, you can subtly walk your legs a little bit higher up his torso toward his shoulders. I.e., unlock your feet and walk one foot over the other, then re-lock them just a bit higher. Your goal is to get the crooks of your knees up into his armpits. Setting up this "high-guard" is a good alternative when they're too sharp to fall for your arm drag. If you can get here, you're 90% of the way to a triangle, armbar, omoplata, or cross choke in the gi (and you can chain all of these together easily).  </TEXT>

If he just cranked and broke something, that's on him. But if you had time to tap, you should have. Just because something is "bad technique" doesn't mean it won't possibly break you. 

Just yesterday somebody posted about his teammate not tapping to an improperly-applied toe hold. His big toe got torn almost clean off. Bad technique can still break you, whether you want to tap or not.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I respectfully disagree with a lot of the advice in this post. A lot of people are basically suggesting that you try different hand grips to attack, e.g. to set up arm drags. 

I think this disregards OP's premise #1, which is that his opponent is already in good position, and e.g. his biceps are often controlled. If that's the case, your hands/grips are not the problem and won't help you that much. 

If the top guy is ABLE to stall, it's because you're not using your **hips** to break him out of good position before attacking. Don't try to attack your opponent when he's in good position; rather, deal with his good position first to open up an opportunity to attack. 

If I'm in good position and really want to stall in your guard, I'm going to see the armdrag coming a mile away. However, if you pump your legs and move your hips, I'm forced to open up to regain balance. When I post my hands or readjust my base for balance, THAT is your opening to attack. 

**So TL;DR: You're basically saying "my opponent is in good position, why don't my attacks work?" They don't work because he's in good position. So pump your legs, move your hips, and force him to post or readjust his base. When he opens up to adjust, that's when you can attack.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> **EDIT: CAVEAT:** This is just my observation on the evolution of BJJ over the past decade+ of training and multiple promotions. I think the respect for the tap that exists today is a GOOD thing. Just sharing some insights into how things have changed (for the better) and why the stuff you see in this video is more common than you might think, especially in Brazil. 

I agree, not respecting the tap is really the biggest problem here. Offering my humble observation: In the old days and more "old school gyms,"  tapping kind of meant something a little different. The meaning has really changed over time. 

Tapping these days means "I'm in imminent danger and I submit, please stop. If you don't let up **immediately** I will break or become unconscious. I withdraw consent." In that case, it is ABSOLUTELY not cool to hold the sub. 

In the old days, in certain gyms, if you tapped it kind of meant "If you squeeze ANY HARDER I will break or become unconscious." I'm not saying this is good, but you used to see people tapping wildly and their instructor would hold the submission right there. 

You'll see this in old Erik Paulsen videos for example: his uke tapping wildly and he just holds it. For a choke: if you're still tapping, you're conscious (or at least mostly conscious.) For a straight armlock, you have to go WAY beyond normal range of motion to really break. This is not true for a kimura - you can definitely tear your shoulder easily: black belts know this and probably wouldn't apply this the same way, but that's just speculation on my part. 

In promotions, when people tap, it's pretty common to see the instructor let up only slightly, but keep them in that position, expecting them to escape. 

I agree it's not cool - like what if I'm dying of an asthma attack? But I think it's not quite as bad as people's perception in this thread.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mostly agree, but quoting myself below:

 I have a few thoughts, but first want to be clear I'm not condoning any of this and I have no connection to Checkmat.
 First, aside from not respecting the tap, this is pretty much what my promotions have looked like across gyms. I trusted those training partners so it didn't feel like hazing to me. They are testing his limits in a mostly safe way.
 Not respecting the tap is not cool, but I don't think he actually got choked unconscious here - they were encouraging him to move and from my POV being pretty gentle. I might be missing something though. I think they know him well enough to know that he was safe. I saw them loosen up a bit every time he tapped.
 Finally, I'm not saying BJJ should be like this, but it definitely has been this way longer than it was not... if that makes sense.

<TEXT> Believe the hype, they are awesome instructors (especially with this submission). I find arm triangles EVERYWHERE now, and when I get the grip, it's usually just a matter of time (like Seph says in that video, "my work is done)". For your opponent, it's a terrible position and there's no reason they should ever able to get out: no matter how long it takes to finish it, you should finish or they die of exhaustion. 

You're right: I find the brace method works against 90% of people, especially when I have the time/patience to finish it. Their arm just can't hold back your bodyweight forever if you're just leaning into it. I do believe the brace is the "ideal" way to finish. If I remember correctly, Ryan says that Seph was the one who came up with the brace method also.

So, for me the limiting factor is my own grip strength, because I'm a pansy in that way. If time is running out or I feel like my grip can't hold for some reason, I'll try the "hand across" method to finish them a little faster.  

Similarly, I always try to finish the arm triangle with one arm and it works amazingly well, but if time is running out in a tournament, you better believe I'll do the old-school arm-triangle finish: lock my arms RNC-style, go to knee ride, and just try to neck crank them for the finish (it works). Ryan would say that's bad technique, and it definitely is, but even with my imperfect technique it realistically can end fights if time is an issue. Overall, it was liberating for me to learn Ryan's point that "bad" technique works some % of the time and in some situations. 

So, I agree you should definitely try to finish these with the brace method and bodyweight only, especially in training, because in tournaments with time running out you can always "add back" the strength/squeeze to complement your technique instead of using strength **instead** of technique. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've watched the whole DVD and learned arm-triangles and ezekiels from both Seph and Ryan in person. This is also my favorite sub combo. 

My interpretation of their advice is that it's situational. In an ideal situation, doing Ryan's "brace" method will absolutely give you a tighter "noose" around the neck. Just because of the configuration and angles, it can give you a smaller triangle. 

However, there are times when the guy is just extremely sharp (or you just really want to threaten them quickly) and you're simply not going to get the smaller triangle. This happens e.g. if they are really strong and jacking their trapped arm down to their side. In that case, I will absolutely go with the "hand across" version and it works just fine. EDIT: I think this is why, in this video, Seph shows his version of the ezekiel when someone is grabbing their own leg as a defense. 

The other scenario in which the "hand across" works well is if you're more squared up with them, more like arm-triangle style, but have an ezekiel grip (this happens if they turn back toward you while you have the ezekiel grip). In this case, putting your hand across their neck can actually close up some space to help finish, but it will probably be an air choke.

This is why Ryan would say that the method Seph shows is not wrong, just different. 

**So bottom line TL;DR**: I always try Ryan's brace method first, because it can be more efficient sometimes (allowing me to use my body weight to tighten up the noose by leaning North.) However, if they're defending well and I want to threaten them right away, I'll go with the classic hand-across grip that Seph shows. Hope that helps.

Humble request: My training partners have some excellent top pressure, so even when I can get that elbow in, I find that they are often able to "float" on my elbow. 

So I can get the elbow in as a check, but often can't use it to get back to guard. **Can you suggest any follow-ups/alternatives to shrimping?**

Some things that have worked for me include backrolling over them (since they're so high up and my hips are free) or switching to an elbow-push situp escape on the other side (Marcelo style) </TEXT>

If stress does get above a couple bars, I just camp and the Jester takes care of it (I almost never have HP damage to fix in camp because the strategy is so safe.) I think the Jester is really under-rated! </TEXT>

And by "effective" I don't even mean "win" - I mean nothing they do will even appear to make a difference on the situation. 

Generally in training (aside from comp season) I'm never giving more than 50%. That being said, rather than agreeing to "go light," it's better to explicitly agree to flow roll where each person is giving up some ground to the other within reason. 

This is harder to "teach" but ultimately better for both people in terms of learning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My basic strategy is to spam stuns (Yawp, Flashbang, sometimes Dazzling Light) which allows me to not only take down enemies safely, but also stall long enough to get plenty of heals out to keep everyone near full health. 

High crit chance and Jester camp skills keep stress low. Most of my DPS comes from Slice Off and occasionally Finish Him (if I don't need an extra flashbang to keep enemy stunned). 

Currently, this team seems game-breaking even against high-stun-resist enemies in later game. But I'm sure I haven't fully optimized my skills/strategies. Any suggestions to adjust team composition or skills?

<TEXT> when creating a taxonomy for a system there's a natural tension between specificity and generality. for naming conventions, you want to get to a sweet spot: not too specific, not too general. 

I know almost all of the 10thP naming conventions, and I have to say they are just way too specific. judo has the same issue - it's just far too specific to be optimally useful.

"samurai roll" and "the truck" - these are just variations of a rolling back take. Just call it a rolling back take. it works for ryan hall. 

"reverse kesa gatame" is a million times more descriptive than "twister side control." if you know kesa, you know reverse kesa. 

on the other hand, "lockdown" is a much better coinage - it's become way more common than "scorpion lock" so it's fair that it sticks.

NOBODY deserves to get swung on over a basketball game and honestly he was within rights to do whatever it took to defend himself.

Honestly the reason I'm so interested in this video is that it DOES show how BJJ can end a fight without anyone getting hurt. I should have mentioned that there is a lot of GOOD jiujitsu in this video as well (the back take, the fluid leg lock transition, etc.)

More importantly, despite the technical critiques, we can and should be proud of this guy as a representative for BJJ and grateful that he handled it without hurting anybody and tarnishing the reputation of our sport/practitioners. Especially since he came out unscathed, we can also be grateful that he gave us an opportunity to objectively learn from the good and bad of what went down.

<TEXT> The threat of strikes should absolutely make your technique change, but not for the worse. The threat of strikes should encourage tighter elbows, better posture, more assertiveness/initiative, and should trigger the instinct to get on top (position before submission). If getting hit doesn't trigger that for someone, they're just not that good at jiujitsu yet.

The patella injury from your shot: that sucks! But it has definitely happened to elite fighters too (gracies) in street fights. I suggest learning to use a "plunge" step instead of the standard shot so the knee never hits the ground. </TEXT>

* Hands down instead of anywhere remotely between them
* No base/pulling guard? Dude needs to work on his wrestling. 
* No posture control (bite) on the armbar
* Pulling a leglock position and threatening a break instead of just getting on top and controlling. This is a great way to get soccer kicked in the head by others if they think you're going to maim their buddy. It's incredibly easy to get on top from 50/50 if the other guy is untrained.

<TEXT> Here's how to crush the lockdown half guard against taller people, quoted from another post of mine:

Scenario: You have an underhook and a crossface, but your crossface lacks pressure because he's kicking away super hard. That's fine - instead of wedging your shoulder under his chin, use your forehead instead. **Essentially you're having distance management problems - you're trying to use a crossface when a better tool for that "range" might be the crown of your head.** If you still cant drive enough pressure through your head, use your outside forearm instead. You just need to create some kind of frame - use whatever frame is appropriate for the distance. When he gets tired of dealing with that pressure and/or gasses out his legs, if he lets go for even a second you'll slip right into a better crossface. Ryan Hall describes this super well in one of his DVDs... either Arm Triangles or Passing the Guard I think, or both. Also watch how Roger Gracie does HG pressure passing. 

The other principle here is that whenever someone is hanging on to you for dear life, they are tying themselves up too. When someone really extends their lockdown hard, it ties up their hips and makes it very easy for you to feel what they're trying to do and reverse-engineer it. For example, it becomes easier to just step your foot right out of the lockdown and do some of the silly stuff you can see from Erik Paulsen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpR6bG60cDM . Or sometimes I'll just gable-grip around their knees, sprawl and pass easily. I.e., if he insists on keeping you too low to get a crossface, I'll box his hips instead. 

Now the real answer to your question: **He really should not be able to defend the crossface, much less whip you up, if you have a good underhook and heavy hips. If that's happening to you, your hips are just not heavy enough.** You need to do a forceful pelvic thrust straight to the mat and at the same time curl your legs to the sky and pop your hips into extension. The underhook holds your upper body in place as you adjust your hips where you need them to be. You have such a mechanical advantage from here that no lift should be possible. 

For example, watch how Marcelo does a 100% standard pressure half guard pass against Epstein's lockdown here. He gets upper-body grips, drops hip pressure, walks Epstein's hips to the side, and finishes with a white-belt-standard half guard pressure pass. Nothing fancy at all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mc9-DXhCLA#t=124 . The only trick you might miss here is that Marcelo is jacking Epstein's near arm away from his body as he walks his left leg out, allowing Marcelo to settle his weight in the space between Epstein's Right knee and elbow. That's the difference between being in a dangerous half guard, vs. being essentially in side control with your leg incidentally trapped in a shitty half guard. No lockdown can save you from there.  **To your original question: Once your weight is safely settled to the side, even if your leg is still trapped in lockdown you can drop a monster crossface without worrying about the whip-up. If he whips you up, it should actually align more weight above your crossface.**

Last note just to be sure: If you're giving up the underhook a lot, #1: don't do that, and #2: work on your whizzer/darce and reverse-kesa-style half guard passes  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Instead of whining and questioning your instructors, maybe consider why you aren't getting promoted  beyond "they think I dont put in enough time but I'm not gonna quit my job." That's stupid.

I watched your videos. Yes you won. But you have white belt-level movement (high hips, jerky and tense movement, etc.) Thats what makes you a white belt. In my eyes it will take you another year at least, and that's only if you fix those problems.

The idea of purple in 3 years is ridiculous in the first place. But you are nowhere near purple belt level, stop kidding yourself, stop whining, shut up and train. And be grateful you don't train at a gym like mine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> are you serious? OP was a D1 wrestler. naturally he's going to pick things up pretty quick. maybe a blue belt showed it to him and it really clicked for his body type. also, RDLR is a very natural transition from basic shell half guards - I got comfortable with RDLR and X-guard waaay before i formally saw them in class. 

i wouldn't discourage people from stuff that works for them just because you think it's too advanced or something.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> totally see your point. this reminds me of a ryan hall monologue on one of his DVDs (i think it was guard passing actually). the gist of it was "if you had a million years to train, of course you'd try to learn everything equally well and be maximally well-rounded. but in the time you actually have to train, try to optimize what you learn." 

I think this is one of those situations. OP should consider their long-run goals and whether it makes more sense to start with what's natural now vs. training to be a lefty-passing ninja in the future. 

as for me, just coming back from a loooong injury layoff, it was almost equally natural to start "re-learning" my passing lefty. it was awesome. but i have been training forever and what's good for me might not be good for a beginner. 

OP - let us know how it goes! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love this topic. This is rare for me, but I'm going to disagree slightly with /u/truthjusticeUSAway a bit this time. 

I think if you're this early in your BJJ career, it's a great idea to emphasize passing to the non-typical side, especially if it already feels pretty natural to you. 

I'd recommend repping new passes on the "lefty" side first until you're comfortable, then start repping the other side and going back and forth. 

You can always "come back" to working your typical side, but I feel like it would be harder to do it the other way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) taking two random samples is what makes it unpaired (independent). A paired (dependent) test would be e.g. testing the same individuals in a population at two different times. 

2) if you take two random samples from a normally distributed population, they will also be normally distributed (or at least follow t distribution, so roughly normal as n increases)

you trollin?

EDIT: Here's the answer from another subreddit. I just needed the equation, which this person provided: 

You'll have to first specify what you count as a "significant" difference, and also have some estimate of the two populations. Suppose you wish to detect a difference of d units with probability 1- (the most common choice for  is 0.05), and that you estimate the standard deviations of both populations as s (use a conservative estimate if you have no previous knowledge of the populations). Then the (estimated) standard error of the difference in sample means is s(2/n), assuming you use the same sample size for both groups. You want d/(s(2/n))z, where z is the quantile from the standard normal distribution that cuts off /2 in the upper tail; for =0.05, this is about 1.96. This inequality yields n2s2z2/d2. </TEXT>

The event was about to start when Guidas camp said they were pulling out of the fight. Apparently Guida had some issues with the promoter and asked to see the fight purse. Promoter **Jeremy Varney** then expressed that the prize money, $25,000 in cash, had been stolen from someones car and that he would provide checks to the fighters. Guida, as well as many of the other fighters, refused to accept a check.

Varney pleaded with Guida to fight but Guida jokingly mentioned something about having old legs and needing cash to pay his hospital bills.

<TEXT> Excellent question. Though I can't be sure without seeing you in action, here are some potential problems causing you trouble, along with solutions. 

Scenario: You have an underhook and a crossface, but your crossface lacks pressure because he's kicking away super hard. That's fine - instead of wedging your shoulder under his chin, use your forehead instead. **Essentially you're having distance management problems - you're trying to use a crossface when a better tool for that "range" might be the crown of your head.** If you still cant drive enough pressure through your head, use your outside forearm instead. You just need to create some kind of frame - use whatever frame is appropriate for the distance. When he gets tired of dealing with that pressure and/or gasses out his legs, if he lets go for even a second you'll slip right into a better crossface. Ryan Hall describes this super well in one of his DVDs... either Arm Triangles or Passing the Guard I think, or both. Also watch how Roger Gracie does HG pressure passing. 

The other principle here is that whenever someone is hanging on to you for dear life, they are tying themselves up too. When someone really extends their lockdown hard, it ties up their hips and makes it very easy for you to feel what they're trying to do and reverse-engineer it. For example, it becomes easier to just step your foot right out of the lockdown and do some of the silly stuff you can see from Erik Paulsen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpR6bG60cDM . Or sometimes I'll just gable-grip around their knees, sprawl and pass easily. I.e., if he insists on keeping you too low to get a crossface, I'll box his hips instead. 

Now the real answer to your question: **He really should not be able to defend the crossface, much less whip you up, if you have a good underhook and heavy hips. If that's happening to you, your hips are just not heavy enough.** You need to do a forceful pelvic thrust straight to the mat and at the same time curl your legs to the sky and pop your hips into extension. The underhook holds your upper body in place as you adjust your hips where you need them to be. You have such a mechanical advantage from here that no lift should be possible. 

For example, watch how Marcelo does a 100% standard pressure half guard pass against Epstein's lockdown here. He gets upper-body grips, drops hip pressure, walks Epstein's hips to the side, and finishes with a white-belt-standard half guard pressure pass. Nothing fancy at all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mc9-DXhCLA#t=124 . The only trick you might miss here is that Marcelo is jacking Epstein's near arm away from his body as he walks his left leg out, allowing Marcelo to settle his weight in the space between Epstein's Right knee and elbow. That's the difference between being in a dangerous half guard, vs. being essentially in side control with your leg incidentally trapped in a shitty half guard. No lockdown can save you from there.  **To your original question: Once your weight is safely settled to the side, even if your leg is still trapped in lockdown you can drop a monster crossface without worrying about the whip-up. If he whips you up, it should actually align more weight above your crossface.**

Last note just to be sure: If you're giving up the underhook a lot, #1: don't do that, and #2: work on your whizzer/darce and reverse-kesa-style half guard passes that involve switching the hips. These often allow you to just get the underhook back and thus resume the shoulder-of-justice attack.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good question! The key for the top guy is to relax and be patient. I mean literally relax your muscles and become dead weight. 

When he tries to "whip up" to unbalance but doesn't have an underhook, that should actually *increase* the weight in your crossfire arm because he's pulling you toward it. You're anchored to that point bc your shoulder is wedged under his chin. 

He'll quickly find that escape route actually made him more miserable and try to build frames with his arms instead,  but it's too late: if your top HG posture is good there will be no space for him to get his hands inside safely. Slowly but surely  if you relax, your leg will have been incrementally slipping out of the lockdown this whole time until it becomes ineffective. 

The concept of wedging under someone's neck/chin while passing turns up in lots of passing DVDs for top players, but it's hard to explain without showing tou.

To be fair, I do use the lockdown briefly sometimes to relieve pressure if I'm getting crossfaced, but I pull them South and away instead of North via whip up in that case. And I only use it long enough to make frames and get to a better posture where my hips are mobile and head free. </TEXT>

<TEXT> good idea to use it as an open mat. pick technique videos from top people (mginaction suggested below) and drill the ever-loving shit out of them. find a like-minded partner. 

drill with resistance, drill without resistance, drill sequences where one flows into another, drill where the other guy has boxing gloves and can hit you. DRILL THE SHIT OUT OF a couple basic techniques.

and do a shit-ton of movement drills on your own: shrimp, sit out, backrolls, granby rolls, etc. get to the point where you're shrimping out of bed in the morning without realizing it. 

then, when you can train at a real gym, you'll have a huge leg up.  </TEXT>

it's very empirical - you can test your skills constantly in a way that's just not as feasible with striking due to safety and other issues. therefore people get humbled - the ones who are okay with getting constantly humbled are the ones who keep showing up, and thus get better. 

hopefully this was a helpful learning experience for the instructor - maybe he'll start taking classes in judo/wrestling/bjj/catch to see how deep the rabbit hole goes... </TEXT>

My current gym is more like your first: the bar for blue is so high that iit takes ages to get, and by that time t's  very unlikely  one of our blues would not have run into leglock defenses at least a couple of times.

Ultimately though it's  entirely  up to your prof. Respect his decision and do your best to earn it in your own eyes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is absolutely a great match and Eddie undoubtedly has some great and technical jiujitsu. However, it's highly misleading to say Eddie's style represents more modern BJJ or is somehow more technical. 


This might be controversial but I think 10PJJ is quite old scool in the philosophy behind it, at least compared to what most people consider "modern" bjj. For example, both gracie jj and 10PJJ really emphasize designing techniques with striking in mind. Both involve really tying up your opponent as a result, and for good or ill, both end up not emphasizing mobility as much as modern jj players. I say this more as a fan of 10PJJ than gracie jj.


If you want to see the most technical and best representatives of modern BJJ, a more accurate example would be Rafael Mendes.


I like a lot of things about Eddie and 10p, but this idea that he represents an important sea change in bjj is just not accurate. His ideas are very innovative and some work great, but to be honest they have not been any more revolutionary than details we have gotten from lesser known folks like Gustavo machado.


As much as I love eddie, the biggest thing he has influenced in my experience is making new white belts exponentially more annoying every time his name hits the news. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Web scraping plus agglomerative clustering </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi all,

I'm absolutely brand new to Python, but would like to design a fairly basic applied challenge to guide myself as I learn. **CAVEAT**: This idea is well beyond my ability at this point. It's more of a motivator to look forward to in the future. So on to the idea...

Let's say I have a huge list of URLs I have collected over several years (spoiler: I do have this, and it is genuinely huge. On the order of thousands). They are completely unsorted.

Let's further say that, *as an end product* I'd like to have these automatically clustered into categories by topic. E.g., some of these links might point to machine learning articles, while others point to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques. 

A manual sort would involve re-opening each article, then taking a stab at categorizing them into topics (e.g., BJJ and Machine Learning).

To my untrained mind, the **automated** process would look something like this:

1) Plug all of the URLs into a program that automatically crawls each of them and scrapes all of (or a random sample of) the words. (Maybe the program that crawls them is different than the program that scrapes the data, maybe not.) 

2) That program spits out data on each link that can be plugged into yet another program - like an agglomerative clustering algorithm - that automatically clusters them into categories. E.g., the algorithm would be trained to recognize that articles talking about "double-leg takedowns" and "armbars" should be in the same cluster (jiu-jitsu) while articles talking about "neuroscience" and "bioinformatics" should be in another separate cluster. 

3) Finally, I'm sure there are lots of off-the-shelf programs that will show me the final visualization in various forms. 

Can anyone let me know if I'm on the right track here? If so, could you point me to resources? Again, I know it's beyond my ability at this point, but I'd like to have something concrete to look forward to. 

**TL;DR: Can I use Python to automatically crawl and cluster a list of URLs by topic?**

Thank you! </TEXT>

Completely unsolicited advice: I think I know why you're getting downvoted. In the past I wasted a lot of time wondering "would this particular scenario work?" And there is some value in drilling stuff like this. But as I got better, I realized that spending more time thinking about principles actually helped more (e.g., am I using strong posture, frames and structure during my butterfly sweeps?) To me that type of visualization is more helpful because ideas like posture and frames translate to more positions than just the butterfly sweep. But do what works for you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> OP: I would just like to add that you seem to be getting a lot of downvotes for this post, which I think is unfair. Fighting and rolling with strikes were critical to the evolution of BJJ as we know it today. 

To answer your question, it completely depends on the gym. Your BJJ will definitely suffer overall if you go to a gym with shit grappling instructors, of course. 

But assuming you like both styles equally, I advise you to go to whichever gym has better instructors. 

E.g., if you go from training BJJ with Cobrinha to training MMA with a random blue belt, you just won't get the same level of grappling instruction. But if the MMA instructor is legitimately a better grappler, then do that. Just find the best coach that works for you.

<TEXT> training pure striking, i'd say it's a stretch that would improve your ground game (at most it will improve your footwork for wrestling/judo from the feet.) 

on the other hand, **rolling with strikes** did help me. it taught me to remove small moments of hesitation, e.g., where you think about doing an escape with perfect technique but then lose the window of opportunity. those little pauses can become ingrained in your ground game, and that's not good (folks like Ryan Hall often say it's better to have perfect timing than hesitate by thinking about "perfect" technique)

in regular bjj you can often just wait for the opponent to make a mistake, and capitalize on that to escape. but that's just exploiting the ruleset, as Ryan often says. you don't have that luxury when getting hit. note that i did not say spazzing or thrashing around, rather it's about trying one thing after another without pauses. just keep moving. 

when strikes are involved and you're taking shots to the face, you will be amazed at the good technique your brain will come up with, even if they're very light shots. if you take that mindset of removing pauses back to regular bjj, i guarantee you'll see improvements.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> adding to this: it's not the arm that ultimately cuts off blood flow, it's more the shoulder. So the shoulder can be pushed into the neck even if the arm isnt across, and the triangle will still work. "Arm across" is the advice they give new guys to help them understand and make it work, but it's not the only way. 

in this particular video, the legs are triangled more over the neck and humerus, so the far side carotid actually would be getting blocked by the arm - except these guys are extremely skinny so there was space. chokes are NOT all about the squeeze, they're more about eliminating space (it only takes a few lb/in^2 of pressure to close the arteries - if they aren't closed, its because there's space) </TEXT>

My question is, how do I troubleshoot memory allocation? My TESV used to allocate 2.5 gigs and above, but ever since the new release of SKSE it will only allocate 1 gig, after which it crashes. 

My SKSE ini is properly set up to use the memory patch, so I think there must be something else I have set up that is overriding the correct SKSE settings. 

Where in my data files should I look? E.g., Wrye Bash tweaks? Other dlls or loaders?

<TEXT> I'm running Tundra Defense, and for some reason with higher numbers of guards and raiders, they simply won't aggro each other at all, and nobody will appear hostile. 

At middling numbers, about half will aggro, the other half wont. At low numbers, all aggro. 

I've checked the factions and it seems fine. Am I missing something? I am wondering if this is related to limits in the game or script engine. Or possibly limited RAM on my rig. I've tested this for mod conflicts (vanilla game with Tundra Defense only) and still didn't work. 

Thanks

EDIT: Thanks guys, I tweaked the setting with Wrye Bash and my game is actually running BETTER than before. I suspect there was some kind of performance issue related to the engine loading and unloading the AI as I changed cells, killed enemies, etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As others are saying, it really depends on the context. 

Often, it is a passive aggressive way of whining that you beat them. In this case, ignore it. 

Sometimes coming from a white belt, they are interpreting something as strength when really it is your bodyweight or leverage. In these cases I'll explain it to them so they can see the concept behind what makes a move effective (e.g., using the end of a lever, or aligning your skeletal structure so you can direct your mass effectively). 

Sometimes it is a subtle hint that you might need to relax a bit to become more effective. But I would never use it this way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're setting up a false dichotomy. 

It takes SKILL to simultaneously go hard and be safe/technical. That skill absolutely translates to real world, self-defense situations. 

The absolute monsters at my academy are the guys I'm least concerned about injuring people, because BJJ is about control - controlling others and controlling your own body. 

These are the guys that are most combatively effective, not just because they are physical beasts, but because they have extremely precise control - they can use that precision not only to execute combatively effective moves, but also to protect their training partners from injury. 

Watch Buchecha up the intensity in 2014 Worlds and you'll see what I mean. He has great control, but you better believe a guy like that will be able to handle himself in a self-defense situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup, I know adrenaline takes over and people revert to what they know, but I would probably not be going for submissions from the bottom in a street fight. A much better gameplan would be to control posture, kill space, sweep, then smother them until they quit, or if life depends on it, choke them out from top position (e.g. arm triangle).  

Defending ground and pound is a fairly specialized skill that a lot of gyms don't teach - it's one actually good thing I learned from gracie combatives-style curricula. 

EDIT: Chill guys, I'm just saying in a real fight the priority has to be to get on top vs. trying to end it from the bottom and possibly getting your face rearranged. Feel free to explain why you disagree.  </TEXT>

That being said, it seems like a pretty small foot circle would allow guarder to pummel a lasso inside your arm, blocking this. Normally winging the guy's leg out would prevent the pummel, and it does seem like his cross-pant grip is accomplishing that somewhat, but I think it'd be hard to block the lasso pummel. I could be wrong about this - can anyone explain? I recognize that there are endless counters and what-ifs, but this seems pretty easy to defeat with a small movement.  </TEXT>

In closed guard: Control his posture. When you get comfortable doing that, start to push and pull by pumping your arms/legs and see if you can move him a little. Don't even try specific subs or sweeps before you can do this. 

In open guard: defend the space between your knees and elbows at all costs. Jam your elbows into your hip creases on both sides and become like a ball or pillbug. In this position your natural frames (forearms, shins) should be able to accept some force and give you space to push and pull.

For me I point it out when I myself have accidentally reaped their knee, and to be extra fair I give my opponent the chance to reset if they want (they never do, because most agree it's a lame rule)

On a white belt I might point it out if they reap my knee because we have many active IBJJF competitors and it takes a while to develop that sensitivity/recognition, but I always preface that by saying it's a lame rule and not relevant in all formats. I would never expect a reset in sparring.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, to me the damning evidence is that they have not banned certain techniques that are obviously much more dangerous, and much more easily avoidable than a "reap." 

The example I'm thinking of is the explosive flip-to-turtle move that paralyzed that Brazilian kid. I'm not saying this move should be banned, but it's ridiculous that a reap is illegal while this (arguably) much more dangerous move is perfectly legal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think Keenan threw his leg over going for more of a lasso-style control on the arm, then I saw two very distinct and obvious moves by his opponent to 1) push the leg across and 2) flamboyantly draw attention to the reap that resulted.

I agree this was pretty a pretty straightforward DQ in the end but I feel his opponent's behavior was pretty unsportsmanlike overall.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just relaying what I have heard: 

Everyone I've asked has told me the precedent is that many (not all) Brazilians dislike leglocks, and the reap helps you really secure certain leglocks, therefore Brazilians dislike the reap. Because they dislike the reap, they "invented" a safety issue to ban it. 

EDIT: To be clear, I'm not saying this is true, I'm just saying it's the popular narrative I've been hearing for years.  </TEXT>

...yeah I'm confused too. I think I've read that Daedric plane(t)s are a physical manifestation of the essence of the corresponding Daedric Prince, so I guess the same goes for Aedra. 

What I don't understand is how the plane(t)s are physical places that you could travel to. I assume it's not like our universe's "Space" such that you could travel to these planes with a space ship... or is it?

So is Oblivion space...?

<TEXT> You have a great attitude, I don't think you're making excuses at all. The fact is, because you have this attitude and approach, your technique will probably improve much faster than his. Just keep yourself safe!

The other conceptual advice I'd like to share is about frames. Frames are your friend if you're getting smashed by big guys. Plan A is to keep their weight off you with things like armdrags and butterfly guard, but shit happens, and when it does, use frames. 

By frames I mean, use the long straight bones of your skeleton (humerus, femur, etc.) to keep their weight off of you as you re-evaluate. When mounted, put one forearm across his hips laterally, and one forearm inside his thigh perpendicular to the mat, and clasp your hands together. This gives you a safe base of operations for escapes. 

If you're getting cross-choked when mounted, there's a window of opportunity to trap one or both of his arms, bridge and roll. It will be somewhat easier to defend when on top in his guard vs. mounted.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So one thing that helps me is to realize that "bad technique" (which it sounds like he is using) does actually "work" some percentage of the time, even when the other person is not necessarily bigger than you. The reality is that your technique might not be good enough at your current level to deal with the strength disparity. 

Question 1: Against bigger opponents, you need to break grips like your life depends on it. Don't try to respond without first at least trying to break grips. The second piece of advice is two-fold: one, you need to shrimp to get your body facing him as much as possible, and two, if one side of your body is fully locked down, you need to recruit your other two limbs as much as possible to defend. 

Question 2: Bottom line: he caught you in a bad spot and you got legitimately tapped. The better his position is, the less "good" his technique has to be to catch you. Try the technical approach, defend as long as you can, and tap when/if you need to. Caveat: this guy sounds extra spazzy and emotional, so you need to be extra vigilant (tap early, tap often) for your own safety.  </TEXT>

You might also be tempted to lift heavy as well, but remember, heavy lifting requires core stability which requires strong air pressure in your respiratory system. 

But strong air pressure will DEFINITELY exacerbate this type of injury. Trust me, I've had more than one orbital fracture and related injuries. Even a minor fracture of this kind will take way longer to heal. Even things like blowing your nose or sneezing can reinjure you badly.  </TEXT>

Try to work on controlling them with the sub locked in but without actually trying to finish. See if you can hold them in the sub for 30 seconds before you even try to finish. It will improve your technique. If you can control someone long enough, you WILL finish. So focus on that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Play guard until you are as confident on the bottom as on top. As a big guy with a wrestling background, you'll be miles ahead and it will be tempting to play to your strengths. 

So don't. Master a couple of different guards before you even try to start submitting or pinning people. Get to the point where you can sweep people at will, then learn a new guard. 

When you are on top, focus on breaking grips and moving smoothly instead of pinning and submitting. I promise it will help you in the long run.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mounted: Trap an arm, bridge and roll to that side. You need to do it before the other arm gets sunk in. Try timing it so you bridge and roll as the other arm is coming in. 

From the back: Use the mat to scrape them off of you - bridge and scoot to get your shoulderblades on the mat. Using your body to escape allows you to use both hands to defend the choke. 

The answer to almost every newbie question is "move your hips." Don't try to learn 100 specific escapes. Instead, if things are going badly, do a big bridge, a big shrimp to one side, then to the other side. Keep doing it until you've made space, then re-evaluate.

The other issue you may run into is the ref mis-interpreting what's going on. This happens more often than you'd think (e.g. DQing people for perfect baratoplatas thinking its a slicer). If your opponent is a douche, he might also claim it was a slicer. My advice is to talk to the ref beforehand so he knows what you're planning to do.

<TEXT> You made it to blue belt. It means more than you think. It means you are a fighter, in every sense. You dragged your ass to the mat enough times to make that happen. Depending on your country, you can hustle your way to jump through that eligibility hoop. If that fails, try this: http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html

Your responses here are all "I can't." If your definition of success is tapping guys who are younger and in better shape than you, prepare to "lose" - a lot. Time to redefine success to be more relevant to you. Redefine your win. 

* I made it to practice. You win that day. 
* I made it to practice automatically without having to argue with myself about it. You win 200%. 
* I asked a good question in class. You win against 95% of guys. 
* I successfully applied a technique they showed that day in class. You'd win against me with this one the majority of the time. 
* I lasted 15 seconds longer than last week. At that pace, you'll be crushing rounds in no time. 
* I got smashed for 5 minutes but didn't quit. 

Look at Caio Terra - you know how long he got smashed before he took off? You need to reevaluate why you're doing BJJ. If you're doing it to "win" rolls, you better believe you're going to defeat yourself. 

Stop looking for inspiration or divine intervention. Try meditation and inner peace instead. Feeling anxious? Redirect that into concentration. Feeling beat up and frustrated? Learn to love losing - you're miles ahead of the guys who didn't show up. Feeling anxious that you cant stop feeling anxious? Channel that back into concentration. Do it 50, 100 times until it becomes automatic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You made it to blue belt!!!!! Are you kidding me? You have surpassed like 95% of people who start BJJ. 

No offense intended, but it sounds like your problems go beyond BJJ. Why not start BJJ and therapy at the same time? If you have a good academy environment, BJJ can be a great "real world" way to kind of test and evaluate your personal progress in therapy.

Either way, just start going back to practice. Don't think about it. Don't think about whatever skill level and conditioning you have lost by taking a break - BJJ is a marathon, not a sprint. Just put all of your focus into learning and applying the techniques. If you get frustrated, channel that mental energy into focusing on what you're learning. BJJ has changed many lives and could do the same for you. Look at guys like Terere!

Good luck and keep fighting.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, only way to get better at something is by trying, so here are my attempts at additional speculation:

* You might be an amazing prodigy, in which case I wish you the best
* Your BB instructor might suck (teaching ability is more important than raw performance at this level anyway). Or you are physically superior in some way (age, strength, mass, etc.) Still, kudos to you. 
* "Stalemates" ... you might be stalling, which is not helpful to you and probably annoying to your BB instructor.
* Sandbagging. Happened to me, could be you too. I wouldn't expect people to hang with black belts until the senior purple and brown belt levels. 

I'm not saying you do brag in public. I'm saying you might be better off taking a more realistic view of your abilities. If I'm wrong, props to you. If you're hanging with black belts, even hobbyists, you should really be a purple.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the real world, all that matters is results. People are going to kick your ass with bad technique. Wrestlers are going to submit you from inside your guard. 

Bad technique works! That is liberating to understand. Bad technique actually works some percentage of the time. Your good technique will not always be good enough to match it. And your technique might not be as good as you think. 

Just keep going to class and stop comparing yourself to others. 

EDIT: It depends on how you define better. If you define better as winning a higher % of the time against comparable opponents, hell yeah he might be better than you. If you define better as applying good technique and laying the foundation for faster growth in the future, you might be better than him (or not!) "Better" is an unhelpful concept for you right now. Just try to do your techniques more smoothly and with more control every day. Non-obvious success rates will increase without your understanding for a while until they collectively yield more noticeable successes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally feel my professors sandbagged me a bit at every belt level. No judgement on them, as I'm sure they all had valid reasons. 

However, it made for some awkward situations in the past - not everyone is cool about tapping to a lower belt. 

EDIT: Despite this, I've never "read into" it much when I have caught higher belts. Often higher belts will get caught and tap because they let you get much deeper into advantageous positions than they would have done in real competition. The tap is still "real" but the situation was not, so to speak. If Jacare let me put him in a fully-sunk RNC, you better believe he's going to tap a big % of the time, if not 100%. But I'd never get there in a real situation. There's a lot of weirdness and politics that goes into belt ranks - I find it more fun to fight everyone the same regardless of their skill level, and I usually have trouble even remembering their rank afterwards.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed! Game totally changes if they have both underhooks - crossface will do very little and you can whip-up or rotate to get your hips free.

To avoid this, top guy would need to drop his hip to reverse-kesa style half guard (effectively walling off the path under his hips) and fight to get the underhook back. Even so, he's forced to react instead of being in the driver's seat.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> His face is being smeared sideways into the mat (twisted spine) and his hips are pinned flat to the mat (since he can't use his feet for base). 
There is no sweep here. 

I've been working the Electric Chair for years - it's a good move, but it's not magic. It has very similar mechanics to deep half - you have to time it properly and you have to maintain frames until the very second when you try to roll under. If you have no frames and just reach for their near leg to yank them over you, it's not going to happen. And anyone worth their salt will crossface you and generally make you wish you were never born. I love when new guys attempt this stuff on me without any fundamentals to back it up. I'm going to put a patch on my shoulder that says "learn how to make a guard before you try the fancy shit" so my crossface will remind them of this important life lesson.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> anytime. as riddic1985 alluded, Rob Kahn is Royce's very first black belt, so this shit is legit (of course the unconscious uke is also a good indication)

this is how I apply my crossface shoulder pressure from every situation now. to me, it highlights the fact that being on the bottom is simply mechanically inferior. people abuse grappling rulesets so that pulling guard seems advantageous, but the reality is that top position is almost always better.

now add to that the fact that this guy has a fundamentally unsound guard at that point - he locked down his own hips with the figure 4 on your leg, and he has no frames to maintain distance (which is why he's knuckling you to get a frame back). 

when my opponent is on bottom with immobile hips and smashed (no frames), that's my trigger to create shoulder pressure like this, which makes passing very easy. 

beginners get away with it a lot because their training partners don't capitalize on it. but really good players will make you pay for letting them into your space like this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely get what you're saying - if I had used better fundamentals (posture and I'd add grip fighting) I wouldn't be in the choke in the first place. In the immortal words of Kurt, I fucked up a long time ago. 

But in this case I'm using the "shit happens" school of thought - against someone with a very sharp cross choke, purple and brown level especially, the fact that you're in it means your posture was already broken and you have to reverse-engineer what they've done.

Looking for advice for when you're deeper into it. E.g. in guard I usually use an "amassa pao"-style frame to maintain posture, but against guys with long arms and good cross chokes it can be tough.    </TEXT>

I can think of at least 5 subs from bottom side control off the top of my head and have hit all of them in tournaments. However, just because you CAN hit subs from a fundamentally unsound position doesn't make it less fundamentally unsound. 

All fighting is probabilistic - while you CAN find instances of success, it's going to be low-percentage. Maybe you're finding a local maximum in an otherwise low-percentage area of techniques, but I'd say that's only because you're going up against people of similarly low skill.

<TEXT> huge upvote sir. while this particular instance wasn't my cup of tea, you make an excellent point that parody/satire/humor is a really important way for a community to develop and cultivate its identity (i.e., the self-policing I referred to, which in retrospect is actually still too harsh of a term).

on reflection I think my problem with the song is that implies Royler himself said he dominated Eddie - when in reality it was just Royce being Royce, right? I wouldn't want to be held accountable for stupid shit my family says. so to me it seemed misleading, but I could be wrong about the facts here. 

from a more practical standpoint of media strategy, I think this post would have been more successful if it came a bit earlier - within a "window" so to speak, during which there's a surge of interest, but after which people were just tired of hearing about it. no criticism intended here though, just a thought for next time. 

Finally, I apologize again for my harshness up front - I'm leaving it though as evidence of my douchery and your much more respectful response. y'all are clearly stand-up dudes and I'll be checking out the rest of your site for sure. keep up the good work! </TEXT>

<TEXT> sorry guys, I was much harsher than I needed to be. thanks for being open to feedback; much respect. 

re-stated more constructively: while most of us (including me) are super happy for Eddie, and while most of us are disgusted by Royce et al.'s response to this fight, I think this kind of drama-mongering is antithetical to the type of community we like to think we're part of (whether it's true or not).  

I understand some people won't agree with me on this, but it's just the way I feel. I aspire to be part of a bjj community that generally avoids pettiness and drama, and instead focuses on sharing information and support to make us all better on the mat. (more effective, more sportsmanlike, etc.)

part of what I like about the bjj community in general is, while drama always exists, the community seems relatively self-policing against unnecessary drama in favor of a "shut up and train" mentality. i heard a couple times in the podcast that you're interested in "making jujitsu bigger," so in service of that goal I want to share my opinion that reveling in someone's lameness (i.e. Royce) while fun, is not going to help jujitsu.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Head-and-arm chokes (aka arm triangle, kata gatame) ALL DAY. 

I have gotten to the point where I am actually better at finishing them with one arm, not even locking my hands. 

Lapel/collar drags (instead of the standard arm drag) should work for you as well. 

This might also be a good opportunity to work on various wrist locks - rather than learning fancy setups, I recommend just trying for them while going for more standard subs, whenever you see them. 

For something fancier, look up the "five finger guillotine." It's pretty old school, but still sometimes works for me. Basically it's a one-armed guillotine that you finish with wrist leverage.

Actually, interesting that you bring this up - I've lately been doing all of my subs from top position one-handed, because I am usually trying to finish them with just one hand while my other arm is holding a good crossface. I often get straight "razor" armbars/arm crushes from mount by underhooking the guy and jacking his arm up until I finish the straight arm crush with just my underhooking arm and my head/neck - my other arm never lets go of the crossface.  </TEXT>

It's not their goal to end up there, but it happens because both guys are similarly good and have similar but mutually exclusive goals. I have to say I agree with you.

<TEXT> Yeah I think forehead to forehead is what happens when neither guy is good enough to straight up blow through the other guy's defenses and get superior head position. 

If you watch top guys, once they get superior grips or superior head position, BAM they unload. Watch the guys in that video above - as soon as they get the wrist grip, they immediately go for an armdrag, lightning fast. 

Ryan Hall talks about this a lot. Guys like Marcelo Garcia and Rafael Lovato, when you watch them fight each other, they struggle tooth and nail to get these seemingly tiny advantages like a slightly better grip, slightly better head position. But as soon as they get them, they have to go immediately, because against someone good, you have to assume they'll be reacting as fast as they can to reverse that advantage. </TEXT>

I have always heard that interlacing your own fingers is a good way to get them broken. Why do pros do it to each other when gripfighting? I've never heard my coaches talk about it, positively or negatively. It seems to just happen. 

My guess is that it's because interlaced fingers is a neutral 50/50 grip - neither person has the advantage. Contrast that with me gripping your wrist - I clearly have the grip advantage (path to your inside space and access to the natural levers of your body). So what happens when pros fight? They both would like to go for the wrist, but both know the other person would like to go for their wrist, so if they are roughly equally good, the result is a neutral position (interlace.) But that's just a guess. Obviously this doesn't happen as much in gi because there are better grips to get than wrist grips (usually). 

What do you think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think they're definitely important to have in your "arsenal" or at least to be aware of what people will try on you. 

For me personally, as I've ranked up, I've found that techniques like that are more distracting (I think that is the right word) for me than they are effective on my opponent. 

I think it's because I've really changed my top game. I used to use my arms a lot to apply for submissions, like this guy does. Nowadays, going against better guys, I'm much less likely to use my arms for subs, and instead more likely to hold on to my crossface and underhook rather than let them go to attempt subs. More often than not, the smothering pressure makes the guy just give me his arm, so I rarely have to let go of my good control to get subs. Doing it this way, it's way less likely that I get swept or let the guy escape. 

This strategy has worked really well for me lately, but it's definitely interesting to see other ways to crack open defenses like you mention.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a great video to give some ideas, but what really strikes me about it is how much grappling techniques and "meta-game" have evolved. 

This guy clearly has an encyclopedic knowledge of techniques, but I was actually pretty surprised by how many technical details he seemed to be missing. 

Of course, it's always different when someone is demonstrating vs. actually applying techniques, but for example his straight armbars seemed very very loose. Also, the little pain compliance things like elbow in the neck to open them up seemed pretty cheesy - every one of those can be easily negated with a slight upa. 

I know this isn't the point of this video, but I much prefer to see many details about a few techniques rather than lots and lots of options - the options come naturally as you learn more. I personally get very little out of videos like this since there are very few "techniques" that I haven't seen at least once or twice. This is not a fair comparison on my part, but instructionals like Ryan Halls are a better use of my time personally.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand your frustration and I don't think you're wrong at all. It's just that we're making different points. That's my fault for speaking off the cuff and not being clear. 

So you're talking about how good fundamentals are taught at 10thP schools and I absolutely believe that is true. You're absolutely right that Machado is a core part of the evolution (also partly why Eddie has a great butterfly guard, as you referenced). I'm quite familiar with the 10thP system and how it is taught, and I think it's great in theory. Ideally, all 10thP guys would take that training to heart and make fundamentals (rather than specific techniques) the core of their game. 

While that would ideally be true, in reality, the newer 10thP guys I have trained with tend to disregard fundamentals because of how laser-focused they are on making specific techniques work (e.g., lockdown/RG). Of course, that's a white belt problem in general. But it is way more common (strictly in my experience) for 10thP white belts to be guilty of this. They are so convinced that Eddie just has a superior game that they disregard being fundamentally sound in their own game, and ignore the specific strengths/weaknesses of their own specific attributes (more or less flexibility, strength, size, etc.)

So what I really should have said is that's an issue with some of the practitioners more than it's an issue with the system (which I actually like). To be fair, the annoying experiences I've had with people on the mats are probably more guys who found 10thP techniques on youtube and decided Eddie was the messiah than those who trained at real 10thP gyms - so I apologize if I made an unfair generalization </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think, because it tends to be a polarizing topic, any Eddie-related discussion has to be broken down issue-by-issue to get any kind of meaningful conversation going. Otherwise people on either side of the issue just end up debating different things and getting nowhere. 

How has your view changed of:

Eddie as a jujitsu practitioner: No change. I always knew he was good at jujitsu and a good, humble guy on a personal level. I still think that despite his shameless self-promotion and hype as a businessman. Props to him for a great performance. 

The 10thP system: No change. I think it's great for people who are already good at bjj to incorporate some innovative ideas. On the other hand, I think it's a terrible place for people to start as beginners, because (for example) their new guys tend to use flexibility and clinching as a crutch to make up for their lack of hip movement, posture, and timing. I personally use 10thP moves selectively to good effect. My very early work on the electric chair has translated into a very effective deep half guard for me. And rubber guard concepts gave me a very dangerous omoplata and monoplata. Do I ever actually use the electric chair and rubber guard anymore? No, but the concepts sharpened my game. 

Eddie's views on [insert political topic]: Who cares? Tons of bjj guys smoke weed. As for conspiracy theories, again who cares? Tons of people believe stupid shit. It should have no bearing on bjj-related arguments. 

And finally, Eddie fanboys: Goddamn they are the worst. I'd say 99% of Eddie hate is misplaced and instead deserves to be pointed at the fanboys. Their internet presence (which admittedly is mostly guys who don't train seriously) places them among the most annoying fans of any sport ever. After Eddie's Metamoris performance, expect a flood of new guys locking down your leg in half guard, inevitably tapping to crossface pressure, and then getting all defensive about how if it was MMA they would have totally smoked you.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-02-06 17:26:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> TL;DR: What would you guys add to this list?

Hey all, 

I'm interested in your thoughts on the key principles/fundamentals of bjj. Ryan Hall and Demian Maia do an excellent job of addressing these in their DVDs. E.g., 

**Grip fight**

* Immediately break his grips, get your own, and immediately use them
* Why? To protect the line to your inside space and get inside of his  this allows you to access natural levers (his limbs, neck, etc.)

**Posture**

* Straight spine
* Hips low
* Elbows tight to sides and flush to knees (Maia's "block" principle")
* Why? Broken posture = structural weakness and smaller muscles engaged

I know this has been discussed before on /r/bjj, but I'm really interested in the way the answers have evolved over time. As recently as 2006/7 I remember the typical answers used to be less helpful, much more simplistic and less broadly applicable (e.g., "never be flat on your back..." not universally true). Also, the "why" especially has developed a lot since then: a lot of guys used to just say "Because Helio" instead of talking about leverage and mechanical efficiency. 

What would you add? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're absolutely right - his opponent's leg is trapped in half guard so it's probably not a true crackdown per se. For BJJ, if you can manage it, it would be great to come up into a nice half guard pass with head control like that (as the BJJ dude did in that video)

I think the head control is key - and you raised an excellent point - head control like that would often be hard to get because a BJJ guy will likely pull their head way back out of reach, transitioning to playing guard. 

I guess an alternative way of asking the question is: what is the best way to finish a "normal" single leg like that in BJJ to minimize the chance of getting reversed or submitted? Especially to avoid the triangle? </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Crackdown/High Crotch Wrestling Position </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> TL;DR - What do you guys think about using the wrestler's Crackdown in BJJ? Does it adapt well or no?

Hey guys, 

I'm a big fan of deep half guard sweeps. For anyone who has seen Ryan Hall's Deep Half Guard dvds, he suggests coming up on an over/under style pass when you use a single-leg style sweep. 

However, I find that I much more often come up on a Crackdown-style position (for the wrestlers out there) meaning that unlike Ryan's over/under pass, I do not have control of their far hip, only their near leg. 

See here for what I mean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjSVk-1mixg

I was actually inspired by /u/Remlikjj's awesome post with an amputee defeating another grappler (he does it off a takedown here): https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=xQ8CcFWBFd8#t=56

What do you guys think about using the crackdown in BJJ? It seems like you have to make a big reach for their head which could put your arm out of position. And it seems like you're really jamming up your own head and compromising your own posture. But I want it to work!

Caveat: "just fix your goddamn over/under pass already" is also a fair response.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Responses so far are very much appreciated - I should have mentioned that my PT already had me try the basic scalene stretches, including first rib self-stretches involving a belt/towel/sheet. 

The problem for me is, just pulling down on my first rib with a towel isn't enough to get a stretch. The only thing that has done it so far for me is hanging a 22kg kettlebell on a belt off of my first rib, then applying additional downward force with my arms. Which is probably a bit dangerous. 

Do I need surgery or something? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have chronic intractable upper back/neck pain. After doing lots of PT, the only thing that has helped me is my therapist's direct manipulation of my first rib. 

Can you guys recommend any first rib stretches I can do on my own? I can feel a stretch there if I place my hand against a wall, humerus flush to my side and forearm perpendicular to the wall, and then lean away from the wall. 

Thanks!

EDIT: Just wanted to say thanks to all who responded. With your advice, I've come up with what I think is a good way to mobilize my first rib. I'm using an adjustable band (the kind that is used to mount olympic/gymnastic rings to the ceiling): stepping on one end of it and then looping the other end around my opposite shoulder (positioned at the first rib). By leaning away from the foot that traps the band to the floor, I can apply good downward pressure on the first rib.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is one of those questions where if you have to ask it, it shows that there is a deeper problem at hand and therefore a more important question you should be asking. 

In my opinion, your question seems to show a lack of respect and value for yourself, your space, and your safety. 

 As others have said, if someone is willing to assault you, they are certainly willing to do a lot worse. Predators test boundaries to see how far they can go. In the moment, what you should do is probably run.

That being said, you also need a longer term solution for your deeper problem of self respect. I suggest you find a gym and start training Brazilian jujitsu. Not just for self defense, but for the culture of respect, comfort in your space, etc.  It's hard to describe and others have done so more elegantly, but I hope you'll try it for yourself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also thought it was psychosomatic. Now that I think about it, I think one of the big factors is freshness. 

When I buy good coffee, it's from respected local roasters and generally is less than a week from the roast. I always drink it within two weeks. 

When I buy bad coffee, who knows how old that stuff is. The strength of the "stale" smell seems to correlate with how sick I feel afterward. Dunkin Donuts is pretty bad. But then I drank a metric shit-ton of Tim Hortons coffee on my last trip to Canada and felt fine. So maybe they have faster turnover.

<TEXT> Hey all, I figured you would be the experts on this. I was hoping you could explain why lower-end coffee makes me feel sick to my stomach and headachy. 

At first I thought it was the caffeine content, but after lots of trial and error I've found that low-quality coffee makes me feel ill even if it's decaf. 

Then I thought it might be the preparation method, so I tried some controlled experiments only varying the type of coffee (even down to the same grind, etc.), and the cheap stuff consistently makes me feel sick. More than that, I can almost smell the staleness of the coffee in my sweat after drinking it. 

I've seen the bulletproof coffee conspiracy theories about mycotoxins or whatever and find them highly suspect... in my case it's probably something more mundane. Any ideas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry this is not going to be a very interesting answer.  Basically, I fucked up a long time ago in each of these cases and lost my pant grip on his near leg. That allowed him to get to his knees and come toward me, despite my having the cross collar grip which theoretically should be choking him more as he tried to stack (going the "wrong way" instead of unwinding the choke). 

My other mistake was not being able to stomp my foot in the crook of his far arm to trap it and use it as a lever to sit myself up away from the stack, which I'm normally able to do. 

Having lost the pant grip and far arm trap, I transitioned (correctly I think) to controlling his near arm instead, but I should have realized that if I wasn't finishing the choke from here, controlling the near arm wouldnt help because he wasn't trying to spin "the right way" away correctly anyway. It was always against very large dudes with strong necks that my arm alone is not going to finish. 

So from here, he is out of the bow and arrow, so when I am getting rolled up and stacked, I will either transition to an armbar or take my top knee and kick him in the back with it, which spins me from the perpendicular bow and arrow threat back to a more traditional parallel back mount, where I can start again.

<TEXT> Agreed - your default should be to try to plant your outside foot and shrimp back to face him, if at all possible. If that fails, go for what I suggested above with deep half. 

Your top arm is key to defending this position. If you can get it inside his legs, you can use it to pull and scoot yourself into deep half. But be careful not to use this as a crutch rather than developing good hip movement - try to move your hips and face him first. If that fails, try deep half. 

The other reason your top arm is key: When I am on top in this position, I'll grab the sleeve of his top arm and pin it to the mat with my arm locked out (all my weight in it). Then I'll reach around his neck and get a cross-collar grip, and then I can easily roll to his back with one free hook already in (the leg that was in his half guard). 

This is because, as Kintanon said, he's basically on your back at this point.  </TEXT>

When I pass the guard or maintain top position, I basically "ooze" through the available space (while maintaining good spinal posture, of course). So I am mobile and heavy at the same time. 

If there's a small space I need to get to, I make myself small and position myself so that my weight will pull me into that space. If I have to move, I make him carry my weight while I move.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Upvoted - good question. This is a very bad position indeed. 

For me it depends whether my top arm is safe or isolated. If your top arm is buried and safe, you can transition to deep half from here to salvage the situation. Hard to explain, but look up deep half videos and youll find a relevant entry. 

If your top arm is isolated or your neck is caught, you're in bad shape for sure. I'm interested in seeing other people's ideas on this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all, let me start with a bit of a circlejerk by saying you've been a great resource for answering deeper questions about technique and principles. Sometimes your answers are better than those I get from world-class BB instructors. Thanks for taking the time to share your insight. 

My question is about getting stacked when going for submissions. How do you guys deal with it? For example, due to the stack I have lately had issues finishing the straight armbar from guard, the triangle, and sometimes even the bow and arrow. 

I give those examples because they all require me to cut an angle in the same way, which is supposed to prevent the stack, but lately has not been working for me on more skilled opponents. 

Here's what I know I should be doing:

-Shoulder and head walking back to extend my spine

-Popping my hips into extension to make my legs heavy and prevent the crunch

-Framing with my hands to keep his weight off

-Cutting an angle to one side or another to disrupt his base

Context-specific examples: 

-For the bow and arrow and belly-up straight armbar I always control the near leg to theoretically prevent him from getting back to his knees, but doesnt always work for me

-For the triangle, I underhook his free arm or near leg to cut an angle which theoretically should prevent the stack, but doesnt always work for me

TL;DR: What do you do to prevent the stack? How do you recover if you get stacked? Thanks.

<TEXT> Back when I was a white belt I had a world champ as a professor. I couldn't train very consistently at the time, he was often off giving seminars elsewhere, and it was a pretty big gym. So I figured he didn't even know my name, much less anything about my particular strengths and weaknesses. 

One day I'm training with a senior blue belt and the guy is trying something on me, like a basic cross choke, and I just keep posturing out. My professor goes "are you kidding? he's way too sharp and his posture is too good. you'll never catch him with that."

An even better compliment: as a white belt, the browns and purples at my gym would specifically seek me out as a training partner in their week before competing because they knew I would provide a decent challenge without spazzing out and injuring them before the tournament.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't sweat it - it's only instinct. 

Over time, you'll be able to overcome your instincts as you develop the body awareness that enables you to recognize when you're really in danger vs. not. 

For example: maybe I'm really uncomfortable in a position, but I know that I'm not in "real" danger because I'm not yet getting the tunnel vision that is the precursor to going out. This allows me to avoid panicking so I can concentrate on waiting for him to give me an opening.  </TEXT>

I have that philosophy about grip breaks - if I am more patient and persistent with gripfighting (instead of trying to advance against his grips) I will eventually get him to give up and fight from a less advantageous situation. Insisting on the small advantages inch-by-inch maximizes my chance of improving my position vs. losing ground.  </TEXT>

On the other hand (I'm just arguing semantics here) from the "chef's" point of view  it feels like the least bullying form of jujitsu, since I'm using my weight and skeletal structure to make things happen instead of yanking on their limbs. 

I think the big jerking movements that come from muscling things are part of the reason why I am a lot less concerned about getting injured by a more senior person. But you have to be prepared for both types of pressure, of course.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> "Cooking" your opponent </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-22 17:51:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have heard about this concept a lot lately and realized that it is something that really improved my top game when I incorporated it a while back. 

Have you guys heard of this? I'm going to do a pretty poor job explaining it. If I understand correctly, it means making slight modifications to your top pressure to suck the life out of your opponent while expending minimal effort of your own. It isn't just stalling because to me it tends to open up submissions better than trying to manhandle things. 

One example is when I am going for a crossface from side control. If he blocks my bicep, I will simply drag his blocking arm across his body, pinning his elbow to his chest, and dropping a lot of pressure on it. It gives people the impression of getting smothered even though their airway is still open. Part of it might be claustrophobia, or reducing your effective lung capacity... I don't know. 

I find that wrestlers are extremely good at this. Rather than just lock down on top of side control, they might walk clockwise from side to north/south to the other side, which seems to increase the pressure versus staying on one side and sinking down. Some judokas also have crazy pinning pressure in kesa gatame. 

TL;DR: What does it mean to "cook" your opponent? Do you guys have any tips on how to "cook" your opponent from different positions?

EDIT: Thanks for the awesome responses. Great stuff. 

Follow-up question: It seems to me like very good guys I train with (senior brown belts up to black) are able to subtly "cook" me even from the bottom. In other words, they never make big motions to escape or sweep. Instead, they just slowly adjust their position to make me feel less stable and comfortable on top until, all of a sudden, they've swept me or escaped. It's not exactly the same, but analogous. Any of you guys have examples of this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd normally talk about principles but Kintanon and truthjusticeUSAway covered that beautifully. So I'll ask about your technique instead.

What kind of side control are you using? What kind of mount are you using? While the principles are the same regardless of the position, the execution varies a lot. Saulo makes this point on one of his DVDs from the opposite perspective of learning to escape - if the guy on top keeps changing his side control, the correct escape changes as well, so it's hard to learn any single escape if he keeps moving. 

So are you crossfacing or no? Are you using a kesa or reverse kesa style? Are you getting the underhook or losing it? Are you blocking his hip from the near side or far side? All makes a difference, and that's just from side control.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey man, I know this deviates a bit from others' advice below, and I don't want to scare you or anything, but I've heard about this happening before. Turns out, all of the guys I know that backslid or plateaued in their first two years had the same rare neurodegenerative disease that slowly but irrevocably destroyed their muscular tonicity, coordination, proprioception, and procedural memory at the same time. I'm not saying you have the same thing, but if you don't start to improve again soon after consistent mat time, you should see a doctor to get that checked out. 

...JK. Same thing happens to me. Every time I come back from a layoff following an injury, might as well be my first class all over again. It's just a consequence of the sharp learning curve. Don't sweat it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a great point. The same advice goes if you are that higher belt. 

When I was a white belt, the first time I submitted a purple belt it was with a technique that was relatively uncommon at the time (north/south choke, marcelo style). I didn't think this was anything special and immediately squared up to start again, but he actually stopped the roll to vent for 5 minutes about how he hadn't trained in a while, and how it's an illegitimate submission that nobody good or in shape would get caught with, etc. etc. 

His desire to explain it away just made him look bad, and our instructor was pissed at him for wasting all that training time to QQ about nothing.

The reality is, your belt doesn't give you magical powers. If you get caught in a compromising position, sometimes it doesn't matter how good you are or bad he is - you'll tap whether you're a new white belt off the street or you're roger gracie. It's not an existential threat and no explanation is needed. If he was really that threatened by tapping once, I don't even understand how he lasted long enough in the sport to get a purple belt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aside from the heel hook, I don't think I agree with most of these. 

I have seen #5 (breaking the twig) and a lot of silly stuff like it. It's still just a pain compliance move. Personally I think it's garbage, as it's super easy to bump most people off when they isometrically commit both hands in that position. 

Watch Calasans do his wristlock. THAT is scary.  

And what about neck cranks like the canopener? Face-bars? Jaw cranks?

How about slicers of all kinds? 

Another "scary" category is really obscure stuff that people don't know they should tap to, like hip locks (not banana split, think going in the opposite direction) and some of the weird shooto stuff like Erik Paulsen shows. 

If the criterion is commonality of injuries, what about the straight ankle lock? I've heard of more people getting injured from the straight ankle lock than anything else, because they think it's a pain move and dont realize that it's no different than a toe hold if done correctly.

<TEXT> Absolutely! It was Rafa and Bill Cooper. Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L0oXIHiPDg

6:40 onward is what you're looking for. 

I have actually done this from guard a couple times myself, as I tend to fish for that sprawl + cross-collar + sleeve grip that I learned from Ryan Hall as a nice setup to spin to the back. Rafa tries it here, but Bill defends. 

The idea, though, is that by holding his sleeve, and putting all your weight into it through the sprawl, you open up the space he would normally have defended by keeping his elbow jammed in his hip crease or flush to his side. So, through the sleeve grip, the force of your sprawl contributes to prying open his turtle guard, which then allows you to throw a hook or knee into that space more easily to take the back, clock choke (EDIT: and also, of course, your favorite crucifix to reverse omoplata), etc. When I do it right, feels super smooth and effortless. But then again, I'm not attempting it against Bill Cooper.

<TEXT> On one hand, there are some techniques that people are just better defending against because they are very common (like the triangle and hip bump sweep).

What I see as "garbage" are the techniques that no skilled competitor will fall for, even if they've never seen it in action, because they are easily shut down if you use basic fundamentals. 

I personally love the gogoplata just for the fun of using it when people give it to me, but I know that my gogo is absolutely not a threat to anybody with decent posture and pressure - just due to the mechanics of the technique.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great points. I actually think of the kimura as a position in itself - like a base of operations. It offers fantastic control that you can use to make some beautiful transitions. 

Just one example: I'm turtled and he's about to get my back. I overwrap his elbow and figure-4 and now I've got him in a kimura despite him being almost on my back. I escape my legs and now I'm top side control with a kimura. I sit on his head to make it a north/south kimura. Still can't get it, so I step over his head for a spinning straight armlock (keeping the kimura grip). Still can't get it and he stacks - I knee him in the back and get my hooks in - now I'm on his back with a kimura grip. 

mrpopenfresh: next time you can't finish it, think to yourself: instead of cranking this for a submission, can I use it to improve my position? </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me it was frames and distance control. I.e., if I can get an obstruction between me and my opponent to control distance without using strength, I will force him to deal with it (go around or try to smash through) which will give me openings to attack. 

If I don't effectively control distance, I'll constantly be defending and trying to recover from being smashed. 

But if I get overzealous with "pushing" to achieve distance control, I'll use a lot of strength and open myself up to attack (usually straight armbars). 

Finding that balance made a huge difference.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't think about techniques. Think about reverse-engineering what they want and doing the opposite. 

1. They want to control your posture, so try posturing up. 
2. They want to avoid getting stacked (hips deep under you instead of square with your neck) so try pulling their hips under and stacking them. 
3. They want to control rotation and get at an angle by underhooking your free arm, so try rotating the opposite way. 
4. They want to get their thigh and your shoulder to form a triangle over your carotid arteries, so try going DEEPER into the choke to rotate the triangle around you, so that your carotids are open. 

Someone with a good triangle will stuff any obvious escape you try. But no matter how good they are, there are elements they need to meet to choke you. If you deny those elements, you wont get choked.  </TEXT>

I would add that the quality of "MMA" classes can sometimes be suspect, depending on where you are. Most people I have talked to say that they had much better results training specific disciplines, e.g., BJJ plus pure wrestling, or BJJ plus pure kickboxing. 

"MMA Class" can sometimes be a mishmash of mediocre techniques by someone who knows one discipline well and only kind-of knows the other disciplines. But it can be good for learning very MMA-specialized techniques like how to do precise technical ground-n-pound.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all - I am looking for a rashguard brand that has a slightly longer cut to the torso so it doesn't ride up as much from the bottom. 

I have a longish torso but shortish arms, so just getting a larger size wouldn't do it for me. E.g., I have a RVCA rashguard that is perfect in the arms but rides up a lot from the bottom. Ideally I'd like one that has enough material to tuck in a bit. 

Any ideas?

<TEXT> Quick question RE: your advice on the cross collar. Just had someone give me this advice in class the other day as well (i.e., just immediately get up in base). 

Just a point of clarification: are you assuming that they did not already use that collar grip to break your posture? I.e., would you stand up in base even if they had you broken all the way down? Apologies if this is a dumb question. I find that standing up against the grip can get me bent too far over - though it's not too hard to compensate by dropping my hips low to get my center of gravity back a bit (usually has the effect of lifting them off the mat slightly) </TEXT>

But in my (completely subjective) opinion, I think this video showcases how the typical 10thP setups that involve entangling your legs actually end up locking down your own hips in a way that's really easy for a top-level black belt with good fundamentals (base, posture, pressure) to smash right through. 

Again I don't mean to hate because in the past I incorporated some of those same setups with some success. But to me what's really on display here is the number of holes in 10thP system when pitted against the typical fundamentals of top-level competitors.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of great advice in this thread, but a lot of it is too late to make a difference if you're not controlling properly from the start. 

When getting their arm isolated for the omoplata, especially if you have an overhook, place your feet on their hips and use that leverage to pop your own hips up into their armpit as if you're bridging against them. 

This will tend to put your whole thigh up over their back, making them carry your weight (destroying their posture) and preventing them from squaring up (keeping their arm isolated). 

That way, when you actually go to finish you will have an easier time doing the stuff people have suggested in this thread (e.g., extending your legs and sitting up hard) because they never had a chance to build base and posture in the first place.

<TEXT> College clubs are very different from any halfway decent gym. Speaking from experience (not trying to sound harsh):

Pretend that it is your first day of grappling ever, and assume you know basically nothing - more appropriately, assume that you have bad habits that should be relearned. Try to be a blank slate and keep an open mind to (re-)developing your fundamentals. 

I started out in a relaxed college club and as a result was tapping higher belts from day 1. But ultimately I think this hindered my progress - even knowing I had bad habits, it took forever to replace them since I had so much well-intentioned but lower-level instruction under my belt.

<TEXT> Most likely you popped a costal cartilage. It's really unlikely that you fractured or bruised a rib. 

However, this type of injury takes stupidly long to heal because there is very little vascularization (blood flow) to your cartilage soft tissue. Take some L-Lysine (amino acid) to speed up healing. 

Sadly you are better off resting this because even coughing and heavy breathing will delay healing as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> awesome! thanks for sharing that. 

yeah, holding the guy's belt is way different - the grip gives your arm structure to protect it, plus a lot of control over his body (note that he is truly dominating the top guy's crossfacing arm).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> the top guy's right arm is completely free to post in this situation - where could you possibly sweep him?

he literally has 5 things to post off of - all four limbs plus his head. he can also rotate in either direction - either counterclockwise to the mount to finish the kata gatame (as he does in the video) or clockwise to north/south for a kimura or armlock. 

IMO the only thing you should be doing in this situation is trying to get your arm back into a defensible position.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great advice. 

#2 is my favorite. It took me so damn long to learn. I cant tell you how many times I got smashed from not realizing this. 

The flipside is that now I exploit this - even against very advanced purple belts, I can promise that if they let me get a legitimate crossface from half guard or side control, I will get the pass and mount 99 times out of 100.  (And yes, they are letting me get it, or else I'd have no chance). 

Regardless of how good you are, it is extremely difficult to do anything if your cervical spine is twisted in the opposite direction from where you need to go.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As many people have said, absolutely do not do this. 

If one does a straight ankle lock correctly, the stress on your ligaments is very much like a heel hook or toe hold. They dont have to switch to another type of leglock to make your knee explode - the straight ankle lock will do it if applied correctly. 

With your current mindset, I promise you that somebody who knows what they are doing will destroy your ankle and possibly your knee as well with a straight ankle lock before you realize what is happening. All they would have to do is choke up slightly and clamp down on the outside of your heel, and your knee will explode just like with a heel hook or toe hold because it is effectively the same pressure. 

You are better off pretending you never had this insane idea.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man, by blue belt you should know that part of the reason BJJ culture is so humble is that you have absolutely no idea who might be a beast and put you to shame. It's a beautiful sport because it's a constant reality check. That's a good thing. 

Let a white belt sink a RNC on the best black belt in the world and the black belt still taps. The belt isn't magic. 

Also, going harder is the opposite of what you should do. Why not ask for details on how he did it? How about drilling that position with the same guy? He'll probably tap you again; learn to love it. Stop trying to "win the roll" - you'll be a much better grappler in the long run.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's awesome. Personally, I have never thought of that as a sweep in itself. When I work from bottom half guard, I am exerting that kind of pressure the whole time.  

Sometimes people will yield to it and get swept, but much more often it works as a setup to spin back the other way (e.g., to deep half guard). You can also use that pressure to extend them and transition to a kneebar on their other leg. 

IMHO, if you aren't exerting pressure like that from a knee shield, you're begging to get crossfaced and flattened out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's cool - don't sell yourself short. I had a lot of success with it as well when first starting out, including against blue belts. But guys with a better sense of posture and pressure are much harder to threaten with it relative to more standard techniques, even if they've never seen it before. 

I still hit it if people just give it to me, but IMHO you're better off going for an omoplata instead, and really learning the ins and outs of the omoplata as a position in itself. 

For example: how to lock it in and finish, how to come up on the sweep, how to finish after re-rolling to counter their roll, how to switch to toe holds and wrist locks, how to counter their jumping over you, etc. Lots of good options.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Key details from years of practice: when you get his arm trapped and step that foot up, yank his body as high as possible to make his shoulders perpendicular to the ground. Slowly and carefully turn the corner so your hips twist his arm into kimura range, then sit next to him, as close to the shoulder as possible. It's all about maintaining your base and balance while keeping everything tight as you turn that corner.

Somehow I can do this but my straight armbar is garbage. </TEXT>

I once had someone show me a rev omoplata transition when you have the guy in a straight armlock belly down but can't break the grip. Promptly forgot how it worked. Any thoughts or example videos to share?

This is the armlock you would hit if you were on the guys back with him turtled, then snatched a kimura grip and swung your leg over his head. I can never finish it.  </TEXT>

I find that when I drop a heavy crossface and base far out with my other hand, even experienced guys will reach way up my back and try to use that underhook to bridge. From there it's very easy to trap it between my knee and elbow and finish the monoplata. 

Does anybody else have a relatively unorthodox move that works better than their fundamentals? Do you think it's because people just don't see it coming or don't have standard escapes?

/u/jiujitsulab has a great post on this. He mentions that what is considered fundamental or high-% depends on the "metagame." E.g., the brabo used to be a novelty and is now quite common.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Technique was well applied. I've trained no-gi for many years, and more than any other technique, I've caught higher belts with the Carni most often.

Done right, I think it cuts off people's most practiced and automatic escape routes (posture up or roll through). It's the only move with which I've tapped my former instructor, who is infinitely better and more experienced than me. So does it work sometimes? Yes. 

Do I still go for it? No. Just as it limits your opponent's options, I feel it traps my own hips in such a way that if I don't get the tap, I end up in a very bad spot.  BJJ is a game of probabilities and I feel I am much better off going for things that leave more good options open. 

The best moves for me are the ones I can more reliably impose on people at will even if they have an attribute advantage and/or they know exactly what you're trying to do. See Marcelo's guillotine, Langhi's spider guard, Roger Gracie's mounted cross choke. 

So in summary I am simultaneously not surprised to see the outcome of this fight and yet still of the opinion that the Carni is trash - for me at least. I would trade every tap I got with this for 5 minutes of shrimping drills.  </TEXT>
