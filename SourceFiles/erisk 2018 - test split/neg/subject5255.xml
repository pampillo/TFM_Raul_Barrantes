<DATE> 2017-05-04 12:19:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's shocking how many people here hate La La Land.

- Movie had such a great innocent message.

People who just want to peruse their dreams.

It's beautiful and simple. 

And the filmmaking is pretty incredible. Nobody makes movies like this unless it really is coming from a place of passion and love for movies.

- I get it. Just because someone worked hard on the movie doesn't automatically make it good.

But you can't atleast admire the effort?

But no, FUCK THIS MOVIE.

It's boring. so underwhelming. Worst Movie I've ever seen!

*these are actual comments I've read here's my link

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/67vitq/when_people_say_la_la_land_is_overrated_i_show/?sort=new





- I get it people have their own opinions.

If you think the movie is just okay.

Then that's fine, totally understandable, but I'm not talking about people like you tho.




La La Land is a 2016 American romantic musical comedy-drama film written and directed by Damien Chazelle, and starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as a musician and an aspiring actress who meet and fall in love in Los Angeles.

<TEXT> I had a dream where I was fully aware of it.

I'm not sure if it's Lucid Dream because I wasn't able to control any of it.

While I was in the dream, for some strange reason something triggered me to realize that this wasn't real.

So literally the first thing I wanted to do was to fly and it's not happening.

It felt like a bad trip because I felt trapped and I tried to wake myself up but I can't. There was more stuff I can remember but yeah...

But eventually I did woke up like in the middle of the night and I just went back to sleep.

I never had a dream like that ever since, like 5 years ago.

I'm not sure if it counts in my life because it's a dream, that was definitely a surreal experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does anyone know any likeable one note characters?

Basically a character that is simply one dimensional and doesn't have alot of depth but just has a presence that allures you.

So Likeable that kinda makes up for that one character flaw.

Can a personality of a character make you forget that?

For some reason I can't think of any right now but I'm confident there are some that are just on the tip of my tongue, I just know it.

I knew I was in a dream. For reason, something triggered me and realize none of this was real. But I couldn't control it, the first thing I tried to do was fly, but I can't.

So fucking strange, never had a dream that I was aware since then... Like 5 years ago, is there a name for that type of dreams? </TEXT>

Don't you ever, EVER, come here with this shit.

I didn't meant that just because they worked hard on it, it automatically means it's good.

I'm saying the reason why this movie got alot of recognition is because of the effort.

It's okay to hate the film but you can appreciate the effort.


You're the one person who pissed me off in this thread. 

Somebody called me stupid and I was fine with that, but you bringing this Theory crap.

You ~~pretentious fuck.~~

Okay I'm sorry, I wouldn't go that far...

<TITLE> Did seeing my dad die triggered my anxiety attacks? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-13 18:03:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ever since how I saw my dad died.

It was 2 and a half years ago, it was around 3 A.M he was screaming and he felt his heart hurting, then he started fainting. And we we're too slow to get in to the hospital in time.

That really triggers me because for some reason, I get panic attacks and I really don't know why!
I'm not a stressful guy, I always try to be calm and happy, I don't do drugs, I eat healthy and I barely drink alcohol.

I start to worry about my health more than I usually do.

Whenever I feel the feeling of having anxiety, it really doesn't help that it so alike how my dad died. It reminds me of that everytime.

Also how the fuck do I make these panic attacks stop?  I'm not a stressful person but these panic attacks are making me one! I don't know what cause it! It's pissing me off!

<TEXT> Everybody gets so furious when they see product placement in movies.

Seeing a brand in a movie for some reason piss people off, but for me it does absolutely nothing.

We see brands/logos all the time in real life.

 If the studio just want to make a little extra more money,

Then fine! Let them! What's the big deal?


Who cares seeing a pepsi or a nike in a movie.


Okay maybe the ones that kinda bothers me that the movie actually stopped just to shamelessly market a brand kinda like what Power Rangers did, but other than that yeah...

Even if they do it subtly in a movie like,

"Oh I see a product placement in the background! Boo that's so shameless"

and I'm like "Really dude? Get over it!" </TEXT>

Yeah I know it would be better if a film would surprise you,

From the words of M, Night Shyamalan "What a twist!"

Even though the ending of a film is obvious, but how the overall story was come to play brilliantly and come into full circle.

But don't get me wrong, there IS a difference for films that are unbearably predictable that failed miserably in every way of storytelling

<TEXT> So the new teasers for Justice League is out and is it just me or does this movie looks so fake?


I know there's gonna be alot of CGI, but it looks like they are not even trying to make it seem like it's actually there..


It's too shiny and glow. It has this glow look that you see in most low budget tv shows special effects. it looks terrible in my opinion.

It looks too dark and similar to the 3rd act of Batman v Superman and I hated that last part.. It was Atrocious.


Justice League (2017) is a film directed by Zack Snyder, that stars Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Henry Cavill, Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher. It's based on the DC characters. </TEXT>

A group of rescuers sees him and attempts to rescue him.

"We're here to save you", they said.

The man replied, "Do not worry, Jesus will save me".

As the rescuers struggles to argue with the man, he continues to denies the offer so they left him anyway.

As the man waited for a miracle from Jesus, he eventually drowned.

As he entered in heaven he asked Jesus, "Jesus, why didn't you save me?"

Jesus replied, "You idiot, I sent a group of rescuers for you, you dumbass." </TEXT>

I don't have any references, polls or numbers but in my personal opinion of what's happening in the world.

Idolism or favoritism, they could be easily manipulated with simple trigger words, also fear and such, it's not just about presidential voting, voting in general in any shape or form.

Because I feel like majority of people are dumbasses and ignorant, and just don't give a f and the ones who do give a f are in the minority.

<DATE> 2017-03-13 04:38:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Obviously (Logan a.k.a Wolverine) is Hugh Jackman's most iconic role.

Since Logan is the last time he's gonna play him, I hope he doesn't turn into a washed up actor after this.

This usually happens to actors like Mark Hamill, Michael Keaton, Brendan Fraser, Tobey Maguire, etc...

Even though, some of them got their comebacks in the end, but it took for them 20 or 30 years.

Because let's be realistic,

Even if you're a good, hardworking actor, it's gonna take a toll on you...

Either way I hope this doesn't happen to our man Hugh Jackman, I hope he continues to do what he is passionate about which is Broadway stuff and I hope it turns succesfull. </TEXT>

The phrase "these women aren't real" because it just yells out feminism to me.


Don't get confuse with Photoshop and plastic surgery,
because there are plenty of women who look hot without all that shit, make up even.

"women don't look like that"

<TITLE> Bad Ass movie posters you've seen recently? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Here's an interesting discussion.

You guys have any favorite, bad ass, cool looking movie posters you've seen recently from movies from the past year?

Movie posters that struck you for being unique and different or just plain cool to look at.

Mine is definitely [Green Room](http://cdn2-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/gallery/green-room/gr_web.jpg)

It has like a good mix of the punk and horror vibe, just like the film. And also the slight similarity to London Calling is just freaking cool...

Let's make this discussion "Recently" so we won't get the same old Tarantino or Kubrick posters cause that's just too obvious. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Had a Dream about Candies and Killing people? (Yup, pretty interesting huh?) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-14 11:42:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I just had a dream. Funny its very vivid, and it's very rare for my dreams...

It started off me, stuck in a house with a girl and my mom, and a fat serial killer with a gun outside pointing at us.

As my dream went on, for reason, I managed to get the gun and tried to shoot at him. I shot him. That felt really good, shooting him, for some reason, and I can't aim for his head because of the recoil and how I never hold a real gun before.

Inside the serial killer's car, parked outside the house had 3 hiding vampires in it. 3 vampire women.

I remember myself running as fast as possible, and as I'm running I saw Collin Ferrell for some reason. 

Then I got myself in a factory room filled with Candies. The factor/room was empty and looked abandoned. The candy machines were stopped. Different kinds of candies are everywhere, and I just took a plastic bag and just took every kind of candy into that bag. It was running and grabbing, laughing, it was literally a sugar rush!

Then I tasted the candy, and wtf it tasted real! I swear to god that candy tasted real, when I woke up, looking back at that dream I can still remember the taste of that candy. The candy was like a long gummy strip.

I can't be making this up. I don't have the creativity to shit like this up lol. 

Looking back at the serial killer, vampires seems okay, because I just watched "Fright Night" and some other action movies earlier, so I felt relief.

But I had no idea where the candies come from, I've read that it means something great has happened me, in fact its the complete opposite, it's Valentines day and I'm alone sleeping all day.

Anyway any dream experts to explain what the candies meant really? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jerome started out that way, its only the introduction of his character,
we don't have to immediately root for him, just follow him for a while.

Then when he meets her, that's when he decided to change, his goal is change and become a better person, The typical "who doesn't want to see a bad guy turned good", everybody wants to root for that type of character.

I'm gonna work more on Amy's story line and the Conflict part.

<TEXT> Yeah Conflict, did notice that.

I'm having a hard time coming up with a better conflict because
I don't wanna involve "parents" into the story because it would add the "cliche"ness to the plot.

Also yeah it is kinda sad that music girl didn't get rewarded in the end but I kinda did that on purpose to add the dark realism of your dream job vs your job to pay the bills type of story in a slight lighthearted way...

But I don't know, maybe it's a bad idea, I'd love to hear more feedback, criticism and advice really does helps </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-02-13 13:32:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We're suppose to make a project, a movie about "Future Planning"

I got assign to write the script and I only got a few weeks and I'd appreciate some help.

Future Planning - This is what I got so far...

Jerome is an angst-y teenage punk, who sneakily steals liquor at a liquor store type-of-guy, gets away with it, no ambitions.

He meets a girl name Amy, has ambitions, wants to have a music career, passionate about it.

They get together,

Jerome wants to be better person

he starts choosing career path

Amy breaks up with him, wants to focus on her "career",

Jerome get depressed,

Years later

Jerome is now successful, a blue collar "at whatever he chooses career"

Amy is broke and struggling with her music career,

They meet again

They became friends and try to work out their problems, etc...

The End


THIS IS JUST MY FIRST/BASE IDEA

Right now, the overall plot is really cliche and cheesy, okay its pretty stupid, but I'm liking the foundation I put down here.

- Simple Story - I just want to write a simple story, not too deep or convoluted 

I'm trying to convey these points into the story

-The Value of Career Planning

-The reality of ambitions


Please give as much criticism and advice as possible, all is accepted.

How do you think the plot should end, start?


Any movies I should be watching to take inspiration? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can I ask a Movie Theater to film inside it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-11 17:49:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Not sure If this is the right place to post this sort of topic, but it's film related and the most responsive so I'll post it here anyway..

Basically, we're making like a low budget short film, just us friends filming around the city.

We have a scene where a couple is going to see a movie, and we want to have a shot of them inside the theater. The shot could look something like [this](http://media.gettyimages.com/videos/young-couple-watching-movie-at-the-movie-theater-video-id106478127?s=640x640)

Can we ask a movie theater to do that? I know having cameras in there is illegal, but I can like explain this and that, "We won't even film the movie, just the people and the seats"

And I guess I could come up with more excuses, "We'll be sitting down, so the audience won't be interrupted" "We could pay extra""We'd promote your theater" stuff like that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're story fairly simple and straight forward, I like that,
run with it, make that your strength, make that the pitch!

Don't make the script too serious man, add a little more personality to it, like quirks or something like that.

That usually works for a straight-forward story, don't let it take itself too seriously..

But hey, if you wanted it to be all serious, you gotta find out a way to make it work, you're aiming really high for that, but it's takes some brilliant writing to make it work.

Right now I ain't feeling it, hey this is just a draft right?
Just do what you we're aiming for this script and just keep coming up with new ideas.

I loved the Creature Go See series, too bad they stopped doing them. I was kinda hoping one for Rogue One =P

And maybe bring back the skits? It what makes them different from all the other movie reviewers. It all takes place in the office and they have like a ton of props so it won't be that hard to make..

Have the crew watch a movie and review it or it could be just Jordan and Dan, they could dress up like Siskel and Ebert... or something like that =P

This is a content that I would want to see from them

Since I heard that Dan is focusing more on the channel, he should do something he's passionate about. You know instead of eating what their lunch is...

How many of you guys would want to see that? </TEXT>

He must have already known Gale had a daughter...

Why didn't Krennic remember Jyn?

<TEXT> I only had two major problem with the film

[SPOILERS]

I hated the "last dying breath" thing in the film,
it's literally one of Hollywood's worst cliches is someone dying in someone's arms as they say one more last sentence and he goes poof...

And last the "talking instead of shooting" cliche when Krennic sees Jyn and has his gun pointed at her and instead of finishing her off he just stood there and said absolutely pointless stuff, I would have accepted it if he went and said something like "So you're planning to blow off the death star? Count me in, they're taking credit for my creation and I'm gonna destory it"...

Something like that...

Those are my only two problems but overall I freaking love this movie =P </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Producers [2005] 50% - Such an underrated movie, it's beautifully shot, the dance   singing sequence we're well executed I don't know why it has a low score but I assume that because people like the original more than this remake. Of course Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks but this was actually pretty good in my opinion.

Paycheck [2003] 27% - it's a dumb movie, but it's so goddamn entertaining. It knows what is wants to be and it goes on with it consistently. This is on par with the Fast and the Furious series for me. The action sequence were filmed practically with real cars and explosions and it looked amazing, it barely has any CGI but when it does it looks great for it's time.

Death Proof 67% - sure it's not that low but for me it deserves atleast a full 70. This is everybody's least favorite quentin tarantino movie and yeah sure there are better ones but I just simply love it.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I "bought" an I Am Legend Copy, 
but it turns out it's the "Alternate Ending".

I've never seen I am Legend and I'm curious, is it okay to watch this first before the one with the original ending or it doesn't really matter?

I Am Legend is a 2007 film starring Will Smith, Alice Braga, Willow Smith, Dash Mihok and it's directed by Francis Lawrence. 


The synopsis from IMDB says, 

Years after a plague kills most of humanity and transforms the rest into monsters, the sole survivor in New York City struggles valiantly to find a cure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine is why are some characters in movies fit and have abs when clearly they don't workout and eat unhealthy or even have the time to do so.

Sure you could always say they just don't show them working out, but them eating unhealthy foods yet they remain fit.

It's clearly just a way to show how hot these actors are and doesn't make it seem realistic. That's my stupid pet peeve... </TEXT>

I'd freaking love to see a Fight Club tv series!

I thought about it since everyone are developing series based off of movies I imagined one of my fav movies and I mixed two and two, I think it's genius...

It could go 3 Ways.

It could be like:


Fargo - It could be a freaking masterpiece

Limitless - Might not be a masterpiece but fun as hell

Minority Report - Kill me now...


I'd love to hear some reactions....

Anyway let me know if someone are considering of making it or atleast thought about it... </TEXT>

Obviously you guys would want more and more, but its better to leave us wanting more than for us to beg for them to get off the stage.

Fargo has been going great so far and I'd like to see it stay that way. 
A couple of dull season could ruin it's reputation..

<TEXT> I remember watching an old classic film, that involves soldiers so it must be a war film...

I can't remember if it was about WW2 or the vietnam war...

It seems like a movie from the 40s or 50s..


The only scene I remember was a scene where everyone was receiving letter but the main guy didn't get any letters..

That's probably the most I can remember cuz I've seen it like 10 years ago and didn't finish it...

If someone can figure out this movie with this vague information that would be a miracle but hey it's worth a shot </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I want to make Soap and all I need is LYE 

but I can't find a place that sells 100% pure lye 

Then I found this 
Soap Chips

The ingredients are 

Sodium Hydroxide (lye) 

Refined Coconut Oil 

Purified Water 

It's obviously not 100% lye but half of the ingredients 
here already used for soap making... 

And it doesn't have aluminum that 
ruins the lye 

Will it still work though? 
Need response from an expert at Soap Making

<TEXT>  just realized Lex could have framed Batman. He could have gave Superman a legit reason to fight batman, make him think Batman kidnapped her or better yet, make him think Batman killed her. That way they're both fueled by hatred and both realized that they made mistakes. It also would have been impactful if superman thought his mom was dead, so that Batman can see that he shares the same pain of having dead parents. This would have humanized both of them and gave them a concrete reason to team up </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a good point.
On the Avengers thing.

But DC is doing some really bad decision on their films storywise,
have you notice that their mindset acts like a typical bad Michael Bay type production

where they think like 

"oh people like action, there's gotta be a big action set piece at the end, it's gonna make us alot of money"
or 

"oh we gonna cut this movie short, it's too long, oh if we cut this movie, it's gonna make us alot of money"

You know stuff like that?

<TITLE> DC Needs to get their Shit together </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-07 15:56:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a couple of  points I want to address about DC right now.

1) I've lot faith in DC, that's 3 strikes in a row. BVS, The killing Joke, and Suicide Squad.

Suicide Squad for me is a mixed bag, but it could have been great if they didn't fucked some things up!



DC really has no idea what they are doing! 

Do you guys really think Justice League is gonna be good? No! It's gonna be shit, there's no faith anymore. It's the same shit (Oh maybe the next movie is gonna be the good one, or maybe the next one, or the next one) and it always ends up just awful.


DC keeps making the excuse "Oh we made it for the fans, it's for the fans" 

DC is not giving you fans any justice if they keep giving us shitty movies.

And stop lying saying that the movie is good because deep down inside you know that its not a good movie,

Just stop lying, wanna know why?
 Because how will DC learn? If the fans express their real feeling towards their movies maybe they will start getting their shit together.

2) And don't blame the critics, but hey Rotten Tomatoes can sometimes go a little bit rough (and Ghostbusters a 70% seriously?) but back on topic. Maybe you should side with them so DC will actually learn and get their shit together.

Anyone else like the DC executives operated like a Michael Bay production or just any bad executive studios who has a stupid mindset of, "oh people like action, people like popular music, we gotta do this" I think that's what it is.
Anybody else feel that?


They need to stop rushing this DCEU. I get it, they are rushing because they want to keep up with Marvel. But here's the thing,

WHY?
Marvel ain't going nowhere. You think they are gonna stop making movies after Infinity War? No! Of Course not!
I know we all want to have Marvel vs DC 
but there's no competition if DC is shit.
They need to get people who know what their doing.


I've watch a Suicide Review that explain what's DC is doing wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsyNWktNYHA
Go watch somewhere in the middle on the rant about DC

My Suggestions for DC 

- get some people who knows good storytelling, character development and obviously the comics
- rewrite Justice League, 
because it's safe to assume that its gonna be garbage, 
maybe push it back to 2018 (Hey you've pushed BVS from 2015 to 2016, and we've managed to wait so yeah)

Push Justice back to 2018,
Make an Aquaman movie first,

-Make a Cyborg movie, or a flash movie

before we get to Justice League..


That's my suggestion.

Listen DC, I fucking love you, I fucking loved Man of Steel, I honestly think that is a good movie.

Ben Affleck is fucking awesome as Batman, and so is Henry Cavill and even Gal Gadot.
Anyway that's all I have to say, I really wanna hear you guys' opinion on this..

<TEXT> **Spoilers**

Need to be fix

-Doomsday

-The Death of Supeman

-A better reason to fight

1. Doomsday

Instead of Doomsday use Superman, make him evil.
With Red Kryptonite
and Have Batman and Wonderwoman fight him

so it's still called fucking BATMAN v SUPERMAN *w/ wonderwoman

Lex Luthor's plan was stupid,
Instead of trying to make Doomsday,
instead he was making a way to make Superman evil,
with red Kryptonite,

Luthor's Plan should have been:

Make superman evil, make him kill people,

Lex luthor saves the day by defeating Superman

with Kryptonite,

 so people will love Lex and Hate Sups


IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE SENSE!



2. The Death of Superman.

Superman shouldn't have died, it was too way early to kill him off!

Superman was evil. Batman and Wonder Woman managed to make him good again. People now hates Superman even more.
He leaves Earth, becomes an exile..

So Justice League will be about finding Superman, instead of bringing him back to life....

*Think about it.


3. The Fight.

Make them WANT to fight each other, not with some hostages..
It would have been so much better to see them willingly to fight each other... </TEXT>
