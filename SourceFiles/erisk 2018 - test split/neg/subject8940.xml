<TEXT> I'd personally say it's more accountability than a fine.  If you lose the book, you should replace it.  To me that seems a very different thing than not being able to return it by 4pm on a Thursday and having to pay.  Or a kid forgetting it at school over the weekend, the other parents house for a week or two and then having to pay the cost of the book or more even when the book is eventually given back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much.  Also a great way to send your parents through the roof.  Then heaven forbid the book has been lost and you get to pay the list price of the book plus like a convenience fee kind of thing on top of the fine.  

My old library, if the book got lost they were Thrilled if you ordered another copy yourself and brought it in rather than paying out.  New library, nope, they won't accept that.  If I were prone to having overdue books or losing them, I'd rather buy it and risk just the loss of the initial pay out rather than like 2x-4x the list price of the book. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They aren't wrong.  The last town I lived in - no fines for printed material ever.  If you were overdue, they would email you and if you didn't return the book within like 2 months, you'd need to pay or replace the copy.

The town we're in now - it's something to the tune of a dollar a day.  I can't imagine that if you're a working parent that has all the usual kid stuff to worry about on top of the regular household stuff that you're really going to want to risk the possible fines.

I only have anecdotal evidence, but based on the number of people I've seen with kids at each library, the one that doesn't fine has a lot more patrons with kids checking out material. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm curious about the buying aspect from the industry too.  Do the stores/the industry itself create the hype because they're hoping to create the next Harry Potter?  

I do suspect that a great many people of skimming, reading the Wiki or otherwise sort of falsely crafting an opinion (or outright stealing...) so have something to say about it.  But in that situation, would they offer it as a recommendation?  I guess that probably depends on how far they want to take the charade... </TEXT>

<TEXT> And that's where the question comes from really.  I've seen people really hate or feel totally indifferent toward books I've really liked.  

But books like The Historian by Kostova, I tried so hard to even finish and I just couldn't and was surrounded by the raves about it.  I still haven't figured that one out.  Some of it, I'm sure, comes down to taste.  I enjoy the story of Lord of the Rings, but I do not enjoy Tolkien's writing style.  That one, totally accept is on me.  I don't want to read him but I understand why other people adore his books.  Some of them though, I get through, don't enjoy the way it's written, the story that's told, the characters and find the ending disappointing, unfulfilling, etc and just can't understand why people recommend it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've seen several articles lately on how a huge portion of people lie about having read a book they really didn't.  They've even created lists of the mostly commonly lied about books - http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/books-lied-reading-article-1.3108606

After having read a few books that made the best-sellers lists, were featured in magazines and raved about on social media that I didn't think lived up to the hype, I'm now wondering if some best-sellers are simply created because people want to appear better read than they are.  If the right person recommends it will people buy it, never read it, and rave about it anyway?  I know that we all bring our own perspectives to books and there will be a vast assortment of those loving and hating the same book, so have I simply missed the point of some these hits or has social media and celebrity made certain books over rated? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm hoping this is along the lines of what you're looking for...

S. (Ship of Theseus)  by J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst is...  a book within a book with clues and a mystery on top of a mystery.  It's truly amazing.

It's classified as YA and the story itself is definitely more for teenagers, but there is "Cathy's Book" by Sean Stewart.  There's a "evidence pack" (in the paperback it's all printed in the back as opposed to being separate physical pieces in the original publishing) that has phone numbers, websites, etc that you can call or look at to help fill in more of the story.  There are 2 sequels to this.

<TEXT> As someone said - used bookstores.  Then thrift shops (Goodwill, Salvation Army, independent charity shops).  Many libraries have used book stores attached to them.  If you're in the US or Canada there's booksalefinder.com that can give you a better idea of when the big area/library/charity book sales are.

Coupons, bargain books, clearance at big box stores.  Checking used listings on Amazon, checking ebay.

If you have an e-reader, check out bookbub.com - they'll at least give you notification of e-books that are on sale or free.  If you aren't branded with an e-reader but have a tablet, download the various apps (nook, kindle, etc).  Many library systems also have the ability to borrow ebooks.

<TEXT> I had actually seen "Left for Dead" not too long before this post on Amazon and started thinking about the perspective he gave.  He was extremely harsh about Sandy Pittman and not very gentle about a few of the other climbers as well.  Not yet having read any of the other accounts, I wasn't sure if that was because the other climbers were truly that inexperienced and that much of a liability that day or if Krakauer's own ego kept him from being truly objective.  Maybe the trauma and the grief played in.

It seems like the majority of the other survivors have put out their own books on the events of that excursion, so I will have to start working my way through them. </TEXT>

There's Team of Rivals by Doris Goodwin about Abraham Lincoln which is about how he got elected and then how he was able to unite people enough that were so seriously at odds to be able to actually run the country and win a war.

Hissing Cousins by Marc Peyser is about the rivalry between Eleanor Roosevelt (wife of FDR) and Alice Roosevelt Longworth (daughter of Teddy Roosevelt)

There is a fantasy series, The Keltiad by Patricia Kennealy(-Morrison) that has some of all of that...  There are 3 galactic empires basically that have been at odds with each other for generations.  If you start with The Silver Branch you can get the bonus of the friends eventually hating each other too.

I have wondered, after reading the foreword or afterward in the version I read, if others have read this as well as the accounts written by others from this expedition and how well the accounts match up.  He spends so much time going into detail about the oxygen deprivation, the sleep deprivation and how altered he feels his state of mind was, so I just wonder if the other perspectives are close or completely different. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Animal Farm is so different than 1984 it's hard to do a better/worse comparison.  Animal Farm has a lot of the same kinds of messages but the humor he uses to communicate them, the allegory, while not subtle, made it a little easier for me to be emotionally removed from the story.  It's still pretty disturbing but it comes off as somewhat less menacing than 1984, at least to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find that so many of the classics deal with the human condition, at least as it was in the their time period.  Often references classics that I would recommend:

Jane Austen - Pride and Prejudice; Sense and Sensibility; Mansfield Park; Emma; Persuasion - All dealing with various aspects of the human condition - usually family relationships, constraints of society - Mansfield Park addresses a fair amount of morality and views on slavery.

The Bronte sisters - Wuthering Heights as someone else recommended, Jane Eyre

To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee - life in a small southern town and how being different impacts one's life, how the lottery of birth can dictate your circumstances

I, Robot by Issac Asimov - Fantasy/AI/the morality and ethics of creating AI and how "laws" can be bent or broken based on perspective

The Giver by Lois Lowry 

Brave New World by Aldous Huxley - Both this and the Giver are dystopian society books with very interesting perspectives on what affects human behavior and thought and how it can be controlled.

Not so much classics exactly as those I've found interesting...

In the Garden of Beasts by Erik Larson - historical about the US ambassador that was posted to Hitler's Berlin with his family - I would also recommend his others - The Devil in the White City, Thunderstruck, etc - they're histories that are just extremely interesting.

Gun, germs and Steel by Jared Diamond - a fascinating look at the development of the modern world

The Abhoreson Series by Garth Nix - fantasy series

Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card - debatable that this is a classic in sci-fi but certainly addresses what it means to be human

<TEXT> If you like historical stuff at all, Victoria Thompson's Gaslight Mystery Series is pretty good.  The individual mysteries in each book are decently set up and the whole series has a great arc following the main character, exploring her past, her relationships, etc.

There's also a genre of mysteries called "cozy" in which I often find the mystery itself is really more of a window dressing for the main character just living their life.  Ann Purser has a series Lois Meade that's kind fun.
Charlene Harris has the Aurora Teagarden series as well.

If you like paranormal stuff at all, I'd suggest A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness, though I think that's usually categorized as fiction rather than mystery. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The OddThomas series (Dean Koontz) read by David Aaron Baker. The books are from the first person and Baker just does an amazing job of making Odd sound real, communicating the emotion through the stories and giving enough of a different voice to the other characters I had no confusion as to who was speaking.  </TEXT>
