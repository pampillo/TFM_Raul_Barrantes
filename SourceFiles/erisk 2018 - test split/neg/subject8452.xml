I shop at both.

I pretty much know what I need.

I also go up every aisle.

I know where both have their marked down specials.

They take it in turns to discount a product, If Woolies brand x is not on special, look at Coles.

I have a Freezer, I buy a lot of meat at 60% off and freeze, use as required/ Also Brie /Camembert for 10%. It's at use by date, fuck me it's perfectly ripe and due to the high fat content freezes well.

If I see a stupidly ridiculous price on something I know we will use I buy all I can, .e.g. 12 large packs of washing powder that were less than half normal price. Still have 4, a little lumpy but I saved $100+. 

Don't get me wrong, it's probably a good app for the casual shopper.

I buy my Potatos/Onions/ Dragonfruit/Garlic from my local Norco Produce store for less than half the price the supermarkets charge.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Had golf balls in ceramic eggs she still ate hers, seperated her from the other one. I might get a couple of bantams next week.

Guava needed white oil, fruit fly magnet, Loquats are too, NSW you can't have them in a Citrus growing area. My 1 dragonfruit got blown off a few months ago but I got some from my Produce place $2.00 each and planted the skin with some seeds on it and look to have over 100 coming up, 

Mate had a farm at Bucca just inland from me and grew Lemon Myrtle commercially, a little Anniseed Myrtle and another type?  sadly he did not do enough work himself. He needed to build his own still to process the oil, used to get a guy with a traveling still to come in. We took some flowers up to the Brisbane market once, that was a dead loss. The pure full strength oil cures Tinea, (you walk gingerly for a few days) ;) 

When Spring onions are on special, grab a few bunches and plant them in a large pot, cut as required, they keep growing from the cut stems, you can do the same with leeks.
Mum gave me some Egypyian walking or tree Onions at Xmas, but it got too hot up here and I lost most of them , have about 5 left, the actual onions grow at the top, not in the ground. </TEXT>

Making Guava jam today with some I cut up and froze a month ago, picked the second last one on the bush today.

<TEXT> Since 2001, herbs, spices, some herbal infusions and teas, peanuts, almonds, cashews and pistachios are irradiated in Australia. Since 2002, nine tropical fruits have also been irradiated and these are: breadfruit, carambola, custard apple, litchi, longan, mango, mangosteen, papaya and rambutan.

http://www.wholesomehub.net.au/view/irradiation-fumigation/23

Inhibits sprouting does not actually say it stops it, I'll plant a few Alphonso seeds then, supposed to be very good.

Didn't know about the flowers. Why are we even importing flowers ?

Mate used to export Kangaroo Paws to Japan (air freight out of Coffs)

From memory he was getting $6 a stem, then Israel started growing them and it became uneconomic. 


Another guy here was growing long stem Carnations and doing the same thing, he couldn't quite get them to 36 inches tall which the Japanese wanted so that the flower would last a month with an inch getting cut off daily. Became a Hydro lettuce farm, then was sold to Indians who are growing cucumbers currently.

That family by marriage was related to the actor who played Jim the learner in Sunday Too Far Away... Was a part owner of the BP Servo.

<TEXT> Why I ask is, I got a Calamansi lime at Kiama a year ago and at 13 inches/325mm tall they all had fruit about 8-10 count, now this was transplanted in good soil etc and has grown to probably a mtr tall yet has the same amount of fruit even though I pulled most of the fruit off. FWIW It cost me $37 It's on a trifloria? rootstock but I have grown 3 from the seed and a mate has a rootstock tree of that type that I can use to graft these on. 

Anyway it's all interesting stuff, thanks for your input...

My single finger lime is hopefully going to fruit in the next year. My Meyer lemon has had a Possum eating the fruit/ will be relocated as will his relatives and the odd bandicoot. They touch my Hybrid Pineapples and they will swim with the fishes. In the process of putting up a simple greenhouse over them as the rain and subsequent cooler weather have not been good.  Cheers.... </TEXT>

Missus drove our 808 wagon into a flood on the shortcut from the Highway to Pottsville once, then pushed it deeper, :) at night carried the son up to a farm on the hill and guy dragged it out with his tractor, water over the seats, I drove up the next day and sprayed a can of WD-40 started and ran o.k. so you could be lucky. </TEXT>

Many tears ago at Miami High School 1968-69 we had a PE Teacher name redacted (But can be supplied)who used to use his middle knuckle  on our breastbones, also did this with girls if we had the wrong colour t-shirt on for sports days. We put up with this as in those days we did not know better.  We had a Pommie guy stary and he decked the teacher after  he tried this on him, git expelled til his mother told the school she was going to suw fir assault, got let back in, Teacher tried it on again and had a Javelin or two thrown at him. Left our class alone after that, took his crap out on younger kids. To this day If I ever see the prick who is probably 75-80 I will belt the fuck out of him. </TEXT>

That said 20+ years ago we used to get 250-300mm of rain overnight a few times.

<TEXT> This story is at best minor local news.

The only Australian news source that put it up was the SBS, which is a unique Australian broadcaster that has international news from most countries, It was put up by an Indian presenter.

 At last count 25+ Indian news sources have this story up.

What is it with Indian news, do they all suffer from small appendage problems when we are playing them in the Cricket?

Even though we are 3 for 71 in the second innings.

My local Sikh mates would have taken these bogans out the back and given them a fllogging, end of story. 

As for the other racist attacks in Australia, More than a few murders have been carried out by Indians. 

The murders of 25-year-old fruit picker Ranjodh Singh on 29 December 2009 in Griffith, New South Wales resulted in a protest in New Delhi. Three Indian nationals were put on trial for the murder of Singh in April 2011, with police alleging that the murder related to a pay dispute

A subsequent Indian Government investigation concluded that, of 152 reported assaults against Indian students in Australia that year, 23 involved racial overtones. 2009

<TEXT> The neighbours daughters partners sons are miners up north Australia for  six months a year, the other six months they spend prospecting for Gold (Have found 9 oz so far this year) They have a lot of hi-tech stuff, recently they were prospecting in Woolgoolga creek area, about 5-15k's up and one of their tools is like a yabby pump which sucks stuff out of crevices. 

They have pulled 250mls of Mercury out of the creek which is /2/3rds of a coke can out of the creek which is a water supply for the local area. They have reported it to authorities but no one is mentioning it.

We have had Gold mines in the area for years, a mates wifes father worked on one in the same area until they hit water in the 60's and could not pump it out fast enough, It was productive.till then. There was a working gold mine on Woolgoolga headland.

<TEXT> Never tried it, could work.

I'm at 30 Degrees south, coastal Australia, It's coming into our Autumn (Fall) here. I am planting out some 5yr old trees that I have had in pots, these come from seedlings under a mates trees just down the road from me. Flat land grown Coffee needs water/shade. 

Most of the plantations here don't/won't sell green beans preferring to value add by roasting/grinding. A kilo of decent Coffee beans typically sells for $40AUD.

My mate got 17.5kg of green beans last year, has a husker and a small electric roaster. He dry processes the beans. They (Coffee) don't really do well in pots. I have about 12 plants to  put in and some 20 odd seedlings started. 

There is a small plantation about 2km north of me as the crow flies, which won several awards but has problems as Coffee is a labour intensive crop, Pick/Process/Husk/Roast/Grind. 

It costs too much to pay manual pickers here in Australia, the Blueberry farms in the area pay around $24 AUD an hour/*Most pickers seem to be Korean/Taiwanese students and a few Pacific Islanders on temp work visas. Blueberries are basically Pick/Pack, the largest place packed 52 Metric tons in a week a month or so ago for export and domestic.

That said, it's been a very hot Summer with temps above 40 degrees Centigrade on quite a few days and this last week we have had over 300mm of rain. They don't work if it's too hot or raining, neither do I  :)

Edit: Added Metric to 52 tons. I'll let you guys do  the conversions.

A mate in Brisbane put in 2x  250,000l tanks at a special school he was working for back when they had the big dry a few years ago. Guys came from Perth to do the install.

Good luck with that

IIRC you get one free eye test every 2 years, just tell them you are on the dole and get the cheapest strong frames they have. 

Reminds me I need new reading and driving glasses. Second set of lenses in both. They make their money from the frames. 

Kicks himself for not grabbing frames years ago when we did an OPSM shop refit, they physically threw hundreds of frames away.

<TEXT> I keep seeing the green, shield Icon, I have cleared my cookies multiple times, logged out both from modmail and from reddit, Rebooted my notebook several times. Still see the Icon showing you have "new mod mail" It did work for a few hoursafter i cleared the cookies but stopped working.

My "Mark all as read" Button is not working, nada, nothing happens.

I only see about 6-7 mesdsages in the modmal queue, if Iclick one to address it I have to click on the all modmail back button rather than going to the next one in the thread. No threaded modmail.

A lot of mods used the remove tag to mark the submission as being dealt with by turning it red, this function is not available anymore. :( 

All in all it seems like you tried too hard. What ever happened to the KISS principle.

It's all way too convoluted for my liking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> .So, Im trying to access reddit from my old dell notebook with an old opera version as I have been for months and started getting error msgs yesterday only from reddit.com - cannot connect to remote server. currently unavailable

System restored twice to earlier points did nothing.

I can connect to any other site from the notebook. I am currently connected via the same network from my wifes computer 5ft away. The novelty of  this I feel will become tiring to her.

So what has been changed reddits end? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Advertised as 450 Bricks, bloke said he thought there were 350, his missus said 450, going to call him tomorrow and ask him if he likes living dangerously, tell the missus he was closer.. ;)

Fought off and killed 3 Centipedes in the bricks, fed 5 snails to the Chooks and 2 new Muscovy ducklings,  Austrian Bricklayer mate came up to show me where he wanted the Bricks stacked and mud board put, gave me some freshly roasted Coffee, left with a Macadamia tree, small leaf basil(Bee-Basil) Rosellas and 3 Pieri di Sapo Melon plants.

Somehow I fucked my neck doing all this. Currently washing down the Naprosyn with Scotch. Sadly I only have a 1/3 of a bottle.    </TEXT>

Over the years I have accumulated  three or four thousand cases of38sp/.357, mixed brands, primarilly Winchester, some Lapua, some Sako, some PMC, some Starline etc. I really need to cull some.

<TEXT> In the late 1960's my father used to know a few guys from Currumbin on the Gold Coast Qld Australia who grew Bananas. (we lived there) He drank with them at the local Pub (Large - probably 200 men on a friday night) They told him that they were always getting Death Adders in the bunches of Bananas. These were generally dispatched with a Cane Knife and the heads crushed and buried as the venom supposedly stayed in the fangs for months and if stepped on months later one could get poisoned. </TEXT>

There was a segment where a man was being beaten in a police station  ? by two shaven haired officers one of who did most of the beating with a batton. The second officer seemed to keep looking out for people in a hallway in between kicking the man a few times, this was captured on surveilance camera. It seemed like a pretty brutal beating. </TEXT>
