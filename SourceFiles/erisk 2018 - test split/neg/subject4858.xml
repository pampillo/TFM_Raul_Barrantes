<TEXT> Except The Obamas would be considered right of centre in the UK despite their words, deeply immersed in the military whatever complex, the system of global banking/finance and corporate exploitation. The fact that they used it only shows the lack of choice and illusion of democracy. Do you think Goldman Sachs/Silicon valley billionaires really care if it is Trump or Obama? To them it makes no difference.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many of you will not know that several regional police forces have been amalgamated into a single force, sensible considering the population is less than London. But promised economies failed and about the only thing cut have been police officers instead of streamlining back office departments.

You know where it is but it is surrounded by effective air defence and in the middle of enemy territory so no plane or cruise missile or ground forces can get to it.  Unless they admit to "rods from god" space weapons, a trident or similar missile would be one of the few ways to deal with it. </TEXT>

For example shouting and swearing into cops faces maybe threatening them or spitting on them or someone behind the front line trowing stuff to hit the cops then when the cops arrest the front of the crowd the protesters only show the pepper spraying and arrest using selective editing.

<TEXT> It will probably not break up as Trump people go on about but there is the real chance of the Eurozone collapsing over the next few years if Germany stops paying for Greece/Italy/Spain or Greece defaults and comes out of Euro the currency might be dissolved. The EU is probably going to change over the next few years even if gert and le pen don't win. The genie is out the bottle and the mainstream politicians have begun to take note eg mainstream Holland taking a harder line against Turkish political activity inside Holland. The irony is after some EU reform it might become just as Uk wanted it but just in time for Brexit. Edit : assumed people would know Eurozone wasn't the EU. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last minute after some troops have died and the generals and government are embarrassed into upgrading/getting the right stuff. 
Edit : SA80 A1 was utter rubbish and only rebuilt after questions were asked in Parliament about why soldiers were going into war with the rifle. Total lack of armored vehicles for years in Afghanistan and Iraq leading to many deaths until the press raised such an issue and questions were asked in Parliament. Body armour decades behind the times before upgrades despite other nations having the good stuff. 

Infantry dramatically out gunned by the enemy and years before things like light machine guns (SAW), grenade launchers, sharp shooting rifle, better sniper rifle, effective anti tank weapons, shotguns, LAW etc. Radios a decade behind the curve, mortar computers that were only fit for artillery not light mobile infantry, boots that melted, crap helicopter support for years and years despite its use being doctrine. 

Total failure of RAF global logistics despite warnings for years. 

The real issue is that all of the deficiencies were known but ignored for a long time and people suffered as a result. When people say last minute UOR, generally that means 5 - 10 years too late. </TEXT>

In fact the concept itself, like quite a lot of religion, is demonstrably false and only really exists to bind together against an imagined other. It is no different to the medieval and later ideas of Christendom. Fine if calling for Jihad (Crusade) against Infidel (Heathen) but the minute it is just them in a room the unity shatters and relatively minor points of doctrine can mean the difference between life and death.    </TEXT>

It happened. And you know the Mirror is a left wing paper? The real question is why it is ignored by "respectable" news media. I see the trend now is to deny every story. The accused have literally been in court, one confessed and they have comments from the named prosecutor and named judge.

<TEXT> Why imposition of US healthcare rather than Germany, Swedish or French?

<TEXT> Most of European healthcare systems include things that would be unacceptable to people in the UK if introduced to the NHS. 

For example France has an ID card system to prove who you are and that you are eligible for treatment, Sweden charges a small amount for GP visits, Germany refunds the bulk of treatment costs and then the rest is refunded by private insurance etc etc all of these things were suggested for the NHS and each time cries of "evil Tories" "facsists" are screamed until nothing can be done. All at the same time as everyone saying UK NHS is dying and should be more like the wonderful European systems.

Don't disagree with you about there being a variety of solutions but  my point is that some change is required and the reason that the Tories don't get hammered on the NHS very successfully is that the other parties know the public will only allow minor tinkering but at the same time not allow massive tax increases to put billions more into the NHS. </TEXT>

No one in the UK could fund the NHS properly, as the problems affect the entire developed world. The reason there is no real opposition to the Tories is that all the others have seen the books and realise they would probably be doing a variation of the same. Hint, there are areas of the UK that have self governed for a long time now and are not doing anything that different or having much better results. Edit : Sentence structure. </TEXT>

They made most of the police/army unemployed and destroyed the civil infrastructure. Look at Basra in the south a city of 1.5 million with no water, power, limited medical capability and then asked 5-6000 troops to maintain order and rebuild. To put that into context that is about half the number of police that a similar sized area in UK (fully functioning civil society, light, power, food etc) might have.   

The local powers in the region saw the reality on the ground and exploited it for the own gain so Iran effectively took over southern Iraq through its control of politicians and street militias which controlled the police. Further north the Sunni population feared Iranian influence and whole chunks of Sadaam's intelligence and SF machine went underground creating AQ linked groups and the precursors to ISIS. These Sunni groups may or may not have got support from some gulf state wealthy people to counter Iran/Syria axis. 

In the planning phase anyone who had a brain and said you will need more troops for occupation/rebuilding was sacked and by the time it was clear that the whole thing was a disaster everyone responsible had promoted clear of blame/joined the private sector or retired with their power and cash intact. Many Generals and politicians like Cheney, Rumsfeld, Blair.

In short they did not shape their plans to reality they expected reality to conform to their plans. There is no evidence at all they have learned. Plans for Libya went the same way and suggested plans for Syria and training forces etc were fantasy. Trump/Hilary bs aside the most sensible part of Trump's campaign was questioning the constant spend of American blood and cash on other peoples wars but even now that seems to have gone out the window.

<TEXT> Luckily he is now elevated to a powerful position on the NSC instead of career military and intelligence officers. Reading his statement he is mad. Even if you believed what he said that Jihadists and ISIS will eventually be pitched against "the west" you have to ask what his end game is. Work with the Islamic world to destroy this ideology or provoke the Islamic world to conflict forcing them to choose sides? Also there are nowadays many Islamic American citizen how will he fight their inherent Islamism? Will he attempt to force conversions, exile? I think they have a year or so of this level of crazy before the grown ups in the deep state of USA "make changes". Because the end point of his thinking will be internment camps for people against Trump and it won't be long before they are wanting to change the constitution for their own ends and a lot of oath keeper types will find themselves on the wrong side of team Trump. </TEXT>

Facts are stubborn things, but statistics are pliable. 
 Mark Twain

Edit : The whole anti experts thing came to the fore in uk during brexit campaign when all the pro globalisation international bodies like the world bank, IMF, EU etc were producing reports saying brexit would be an instant nightmare and these reports were constantly thrown at the pro brexit politicians. The pro brexit politicians pointed out that all the large groupings of experts had failed again and again to predict market crashes etc and finally one questioned the soothsayer like qualities of the forecasting and just said "I think we have had enough of experts". Clearly he had become fed up of these reports going unchallenged and taken as literal fact and to suggest the IMF might be biased was heresy because they were experts. The more positive reports on brexit and experts that supported it were ignored. Then brexit and IMF concluded it had been biased and it had been wrong.  </TEXT>

The did small group programs where in a variety of places in USA the chatted to a representative mix from the area, the interviewer and to their credit the guests kept it all civil and more importantly she corrected people when they were repeating a learned narrative.

<TEXT> Also Cotswold will give you a discount of 10 or 15% if you belong to a list of outdoor organisations like mountaineering clubs, youth hostel assoc etc Some of these are cheap 10 or 15 to join and well worth it just to get the discount. For example YHA membership gets you discounts in your nearby snow and rock and go outdoors.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The difference is David Cameron had united his party modernising it and bringing it up to date on social issues whilst keeping it fiscally conservative, created party discipline and got into government. And then got reelected. Success and results are the difference between evil genius plan outfoxing your opponents and just hunkering down spinning away in your own omni shambles. 

And because this is reddit I feel the need to point out this addresses only why when Tories do it it is seen as strategy but when Corbyn does it it is described as incompetence. It is not an opinion on the politics or policies. It was not a narrative that Cameron had a track record at winning and in reality was PM. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Plus his golf resort (built on protected conservation area after Scottish government over ruled planning process) lied about; number of jobs created during build, number of permanent jobs created in resort, number of houses built, number of specified "normal" houses built and economic benefit to area. 

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/donald-trump-fails-to-deliver-on-golf-resort-jobs-pledge-8693854.html
http://www.globalgolfermag.com/matthewmooreblogspot/has-trump-international-golf-links-failed-scotland/

It is incredible that he will be president, given his track record but more a stunning indictment of the opposition that failed to beat him. Also his attempts to crush the little guys around the golf resort that didn't bow down show the reality of his claims to be about the little guy in USA. None of it bodes well.

<TEXT> Exactly. The spy you know about is not the problem. Look at some americans spying for foreign powers and it is laughable to think there are not a bunch of undiscovered traitors right now funneling secrets to foreign powers, especially given the massive increase in private contractors inside the spy infrastructure. A grown up would have to assume that everything Snowdon disclosed had already been sold secretly by someone who hasn't been caught yet, has retired and will never be caught.

USA corporate tax rate is one of the highest in the world but very few corporations pay the rate because of loop holes etc. Everyone (except lawyers) agrees that the US tax code is a basket case and needs to be simplified. A lower tax rate, comparable with Europe's, might mean more tax revenue for the US government. Edit : dv facts is what got you all into the "post truth" mess in the first place.

<TEXT> Denying facts just leads to the rise of fringe politics. Most street sleepers are junkies and alkies who cannot function in society or free spirits who don't want to function in the system. Most people begging have a roof over their head (might be a hostel or whatever), many at the bottom of society are eastern european because it is easier here than Romania etc. Let compassion be based in reality help the drug addicts and alcoholics get well but don't be in denial. Admit the true numbers of immigration into England and it is a bit clearer why there are no houses. None of what I have said is anti immigration but if you are going to let in roughly a million extra people every 5 years be honest and plan for it. 

Also improve the existing housing stock and remove the exploitative landlords/housing cartels. Build more houses and make decisions transparent. </TEXT>

In my country most think Trump is a dick, I think he is a dick, which just made everyone say how amazing Hillary was but if you listed some of the terrible things she has done/been involved with they don't believe you. The worst thing about today's political discussion is having to be in Team A or Team B and then distorting  reality/ignoring fact to make it fit your Teams view or defeat the other teams argument.

<TEXT> Authoritarianism can be the opposite of fascist. If I was hard left I could say prostitution and porn are forms of oppression because it is impossible to volunteer because those involved are oppressed and unable to make free choices, like the poor. In fact the only way will be to liberate the masses from the paradigm of enforced exchange of labour ie capitalism etc etc. But you have your view, your buzzwords and no doubt a community of like minded people to reflect your opinions back to you. You clearly have no real knowledge of the UK if you think it is in danger of becoming a nazi country. It would be like me watching the trump election and the red states and declaring the USA about to become a fascist christian theocracy and women are about to become the chattals of men and homemakers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It has nothing to do with right wing fascism. It is just authoritarianism and can be equally left wing. Not mentioned is that much of the antiporn stuff has come from the left and womens rights groups opposed to "odd" porn like extreme penetration etc in fact there is a whole viewpoint within feminism that porn is exploitation and the objectification of women. But this view is simultaneously held with the opposing view that porn is good, own your sexuality etc because unlike the view of facebook, feminism is a fairly broad philosophy and when you get into details there is substantial variation. A lot of this came about from growing anti porn pressure during the Blair years and politicians like Harriet Harman, who is arguably not left wing is certainly not right wing fascist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Murder in Scotland gets you a life sentence which is usually around 8-12 years in jail if no crazy circumstances like sex or torture, then you are subject to control by the govt for the rest of your life. Culpable homicide gets you an 8 - 12 year sentence which in some cases means 3 years in jail then out on probation till sentence ends. It is not a life sentence. But the key thing is it is very much cheaper for the govt. Most people will take the plea so no expensive trial costs, much shorter jail costs and a big tick in the win column for the state. All good except there are suspicions that some cases are being plead out when they should be tried for murder and the killers are out in 3 or 4 years. </TEXT>

They don't get paid, only expenses and are happy to do it as their duty to society. Plus before the panels of random people take over you spend a year breaking up the corporations into more local smaller entities owned by the local councils. Workers would move to areas that need workers because of their civic duties. Local councils would be elected. Elections would be approved by a local representative who has proved his civic reliability. The local representative would make sure the capitalist oppressors do not sneak back in and the people remain free. Local reps would report up a chain of regional reps. Obviously everyone who loves America will do this happily for the good of the nation. If you don't, you hate America, freedom and the future of our children. Those are not the best kind of people but regional reps will convince them to help the real Americans. I will obviously oversee all this and help secure happiness and purpose for all Americans. I will wait for the buzzfeed poll to decide if Fatherland or Motherland sounds better. Future policies will fallout from that decision. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This happened during the Blair years in the UK. White working class areas that had always voted Labour began to have more and more immigrants arrive and settle in the areas. The government lied again and again about the numbers of immigrants coming in. The locals could see the govt was lying but if they said anything they were called bigots/racist which immediately shut down their right to have an opinion and the debate. The problem was it was the truth on the ground and when the Govt gave the locals the brush off they turned to anti immigrant groups. Immigrants numbers did cause problems and did make local services worse because the national government was not funding the councils for the newly arrived populations. It wasn't until local labour councils began saying openly there were too many migrants for their services that the problem was addressed. Margret Hodge (local Labour MP) went door to door and fought the far right candidates in elections and when the working class locals were spoken to as humans and their concerns taken seriously the support for the far right evaporated. 

In Scotland there is far far less immigration and pressure on local services is for different reasons but still the local working class areas were taken for granted by the Labour machine in power for decades, there was real shock when overnight the SNP gutted Labour Scotland. 

People don't like being taken for granted and even if they work in a warehouse or shop they can tell when they are being patronised or spoken to condescendingly. Left wing or right wing, much of the voting is anti-establishment and should be a wake up call to the political class to reengage and listen to all voters not just each other and people like themselves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All Scotch whisky has to be aged 3 years to be called scotch. That is 3 years as judged by the tax office (legal requirement) if they manage the dates right it can do just over 2 years in a bonded warehouse and it now qualifies as "Scotch". The named single malt distilleries used to send upwards of 70% of their produce to the big name conglomerate blends like famous grouse, teachers etc where it would be mixed with other 3 year olds and grain whisky to make the standard blends which are the bulk of the scotch whisky market. This gave them the revenue stream to support the development of their "real" product the 10 plus aged whiskies that are their own brand. 

But now virtually all the Scotch whisky malt makers are owned by huge transnational companies that finance the creation of brands, huge marketing budgets, product placement into the Asian markets and the aging of stock. There is also the marketing creation of "special" non aged stock branding so the distillery with a big name single malt will call it something like dark storm sherry cask and charge premium price for it but omit the fact it has not been aged at all so the mark up is crazy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The bike would make a great tourer. Think of all the bikepacking and pannier touring now done on MTBs, fast touring done on cross bikes/road bikes, your hybrid would be great but you probably do want a triple if you are climbing hills fully loaded. You are right about it being a cost/time/effort judgement. If you still have to buy panniers/rack etc then it will probably cost you a minimum of 300 to convert. It might be easier to buy a new bike already with triple gears and sell the one you have. One thing to be wary of is buying secondhand unless you get a really good look at it or know/trust the seller. So many secondhand "bargins" need wheels trued/serviced/new bottom bracket/new cassette/chain etc and that can quite quickly eat away any savings over a new bike. 

Convert yours or not? Up to you and DIY would mean you could fix it all yourself on your next round the world trip. It would work out cheaper but probably only by a few hundred. It would take time and lots of youtube videos or visits to local bike co op to get help plus tools. If you do decide to do it here are some links about parts to give you an idea of costs/options etc

Handle bars - Drop bars are good but so are butterfly bars and flatbars with good bar ends that give multiple hand positions. Flatbar gears shifters/brakes go straight onto butterfly bars.

Saddle - I tour in road bike shorts on a mtb saddle very comfy and cheaper than brooks.

Gears/Transmission/Make it a triple :

You can buy a complete Shimano Deore triple groupset for about 160ish, if you can fit it yourself that would be cheaper than buying triple conversion pieces for your sora flatbar groupset (chainset 75?, front derailleur 20?, shifter 80). The bike shop is a good price inc labour and non sora parts will be just as good for touring.

<TEXT> Look at IMF support for various EU projects like the Euro and their recent admission that they got it totally wrong and it was completely political bias and wishful thinking. 

During the Brexit vote of UK in or out of the EU one politician kept getting challenged on economic predictions of failure if UK left the EU. He eventually just said it was about more than economics and that the IMF etc had failed several times on predicting global trends  and that knowing this people had had enough of experts. He was mocked but lo and behold a few months later an internal IMF report admitted that much of its European forecasting was bullshit and aimed to prop up the political idea of an EU federal state.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah politics online can escalate quickly. One of the problems I see is it is so tribal and each "tribe" has its message and narrative and everything is bent to accommodate/reinforce the values. You see it with the dog whistle issues that people rally round. 

I suppose the problem is that the FBI probably has too many people who are suspicious to pay close attention to. But then that is in itself a measure of success that there are no networks operating, no growing Islamist insurrection threatening the state which was the intent of AQ back in the 90s. To have growing cells in USA carrying out plots and attacks radicalizing the organic muslim population. Nowadays as bad as the handful of deaths are it really is the mentally ill, inspired by ISIS doing a shooting or one act they get killed doing. AQ in Iraq at one point were doing car bombs everyday in Baghdad that is what they wanted in USA/Europe but they failed. 

As to mass surveillance various spy types have mentioned that they now have too much data and are being overwhelmed making targeted surveillance difficult. That should be their clue to row back on the mass collection.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ban foreign funding for religious cultural expansion above a certain level ie no more Saudi mega mosques, deport/deny access to foreign preachers that proclaim hate for the west. Enforce existing laws that ban segregation of the sexes and hate speech against gays, jews etc. Many reporters went into mosques and found preachers praising the Taliban and AQ/ISIS so fine them get their assets and close the mosque. Give money to the moderate forms of Islam. Register Muslim preachers just as you register the Christian established religions preachers. But a good starting place would be for the left to embrace its old school principles and stop pandering to Islamism because they are generically anti-USA/Israel. There are so many examples of the left working with islamists to fight "oppression" then once they win the left is decimated Iran, Turkey etc Political Islam is incompatible with socialist progress in every way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To give it some USA context the only challenger to Theresa May was Andrea Leadsom. Andrea was popular within the party and by all accounts an effective MP for her constituents but the general public hadn't heard of her. Within 3 days of her going into the public eye by running for leader it came out that she was a devout christian and that founded the basis of her decisions, then she said being a mother she thought of the future implying Theresa May, no children, was a worse candidate. That was poison even in her own party people told her she had crossed the line. Imagine in USA if being a devout Christian and going on about the children and family values made you unelectable. And this is the centre right party in the UK. </TEXT>

Also during the spanish civil war the republican forces spent as much time fighting each other think bolsheviks vs anarchists etc From wikipedia  - Pro-Soviet Communists committed numerous atrocities against fellow Republicans, including other Marxists: Andr Marty, known as the Butcher of Albacete, was responsible for the deaths of some 500 members of the International Brigades.[268] Andreu Nin, leader of the POUM (Workers' Party of Marxist Unification), and many other prominent POUM members, were murdered by the Communists, with the help of the USSR's NKVD.[269] </TEXT>

They have done it with equipment from rifles to radios they know are shit but tests are designed to be passed then test exercises are 100% perfect, everyone is happy, they get promoted then leave to join the bidder that won. Except a few years later the frontline troops are getting killed because of the greed and ambition of the desk officer who now has a massive pension and is working in civvy street as a consultant.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is so sad that the original in the 1980s was more progressive than this cash cow milking movie. Think of the characters like the secretary she was the every woman doing a shitty job surrounded by idiots, she was sassy and good at her job. Think of Winston a normal everyday guy who needs a job, the everyman who heightens the weirdness of the fact they are hunting ghosts but isn't ultra black he is just "average joe". Sigourny Weaver is a top class classical musician who rejects the advances of one of the main characters making him look like a jerk. There are movies that deserve some retrospective payback from women but Ghostbusters was the wrong target go remake Porkies or whatever. </TEXT>

When they arrive their passports are taken, their terms and conditions of employment change at the whim of the employment agents, it is made very clear to them that they have a large debt for being allowed to ship over to UAE for work they will have to pay that off or their families will be homeless and they will be jailed in UAE. They have no rights in the host countries. At best it is hard work but because they have no rights they die/get injured due to terrible working conditions or get raped and abused as domestic staff.

<TEXT> 2013 April: As part of Operation Pitsford 11 Muslim extremists are jailed for a plotting terror attack involving suicide Bombers.

2015 5 December: Three people are stabbed at Leytonstone tube station in east London, with one person suffering severe knife injuries; police subsequently announced that they were treating the stabbings as a 'terrorist incident'.

2015 12 Feb : Liverpool Ricin Plot: Mohammed Ammar Ali, an I.T. worker who rented a flat in Liverpool as a base of operations, attempted to buy 500 mg of Ricin, which could kill an possible 1,400 people, using the darkweb. He was instead delivered a white powder by the FBI. Evidence was also found of attempts to purchase rabbits or chinchillas to test the poison out on.

2015 7 July : Attempted anniversary London 7/7 bomb plot. Mohammed Rehman and Sana Ahmed Khan were found guilty of possession of 10 kg of Urea Nitrate. Rehman called himself the 'silent bomber' and asked his twitter followers to choose between the Westfield Shopping Centre or the London Underground for the planned suicide bomb.

Plus look at all the Muslim UK citizens who left the UK to rape and murder for ISIS and happily update their social media. The threat is real but it is as real for all British citizens as ISIS and the like kill far more Muslims than any other grouping. It is less of a threat than the 70s but most of that activity was in the province. </TEXT>

Plenty of other nationalities in the world beyond the EU and even then if Brexit happens Eu citizens will have ages to adjust. If you have a job get a UK work visa they will still need all the workforce just they will give them work visas. On holiday? There are many bi lateral agreements that provide visa free travel and get you a 6 month stamp in your passport. In fact unless you are trying to claim benefits or get free health care I don't think much will change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really isn't a referendum on David Cameron, if anything it is showing how the general public has a growing mistrust of the establishment. By establishment I mean all political parties and all special interest groups that push an agenda like Oxfam etc charities/lobbyists are very established and deeply woven into the political establishment (which is a good thing). The average person in the street isn't very political and the most common reaction to statements from brexit or remain campaigns is, "Well they would say that wouldn't they." But the underlying thought is the UK political machine lied about immigration numbers and costs for 20 years so why believe anything they say now. Likewise the EU they have lied so often that why believe anything they say now. It is the distrust that people resent and why the Brexit camp is doing so well  when people thought it would disappear and the referendum was a done deal for remain. I think the public support for brexit has surprised the politicians/media. Also there is the fact that UKIP got more votes than the SNP but 53 less MPs so there is some silent public resentment in England at that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are probably referring to WW2 (genocidal war) but the history and development of Europe is littered with small massacres and wars over religion and political dominance. People take the progressive society of western Europe for granted. More likely than the germans firing up the ovens for the muslims, is that states will begin to bring religion under control and restrict the interpretation of the koran and perhaps license muslim preachers/mosques. For example making it acceptable for people to renounce Islam. That is how Christianity was tamed by the state and it works. And for all the bleeding hearts crying "thats racist!" lets not pretend they have the same freedoms of religion in Iran or Saudi, try preaching against the establishment there and see what happens.  </TEXT>

In the 1990s I knew a UK male student who went to an orienteering competition in Sweden where at the end they had large mixed gender open air showers in the forest. Everyone just got naked, fast shower then into warm dry clothes. That is progressive to break the slightly perverted view that the naked body can only be sexual rather than normal. Sweden is going backwards fast. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Blair ignored his military leaders, sent them to war underfunded and under equipped. On the initial invasion there was not enough ammunition for anyone but the very front troops. Logistics and engineers were crossing into Iraq with 20 bullets each. Whilst the military is to blame for the old crap vehicles, rubbish body armour, old radios, dodgy weapons etc Blair refused to allow the military to begin preparations for the war (ordering transport, organising the logistics, generally preparing xthousand troops for future deployment) which takes months until it was months overdue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The left has a real problem addressing inherent issues in Islam. Islam seems to embrace so many left wing principles like charity, community and anti-capitalism plus the bonus points of being anti American/anti-Israel for the more radical and is an easy demonstration of non racism. But it does seem to get a pass in Europe from the political left that white European institutions do not. Separate schools, status of women, domestic violence, racism, acceptance of slavery, the fact it is a religion at all etc. Now some of these things can be leveled at extreme crony corporate capitalism but Islam is the only philosophy or method of organisation that gets a pass on criticism from the left. Left wing supporters and Islamists have joined together to fight oppression in the past but the Islamists usually end up crushing the left after achieving their aims. The Iranian revolution is a perfect example and perhaps to some extent the dismantling of the deep state in Turkey leading to emperor Erdogan.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Coal is one of the most destructive fuel available. Thank god the mines closed. Lucky for the environment the NUM tried to bring down an elected government rather than modernise the coal industry and save jobs. Also thanks to the old style confrontational unions of the 70s and 80s there was no future for any industry in the UK as we watched the death of ship building, car making etc. Nissan and Ford would have pulled out/shut down years ago without the change brought on in the 80s. The pragmatic unions that work with industry came about because the parts of the union movement itself realised nutters had taken over and perhaps working with Nissan to create super productive working environments was better for members than scheming for class war and striking at every opportunity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Make sure you have a solid door into your living space. Your front door should not be able to be kicked apart. It should need a axe to get through it. Once you have a solid front door make sure it has at least 2 locks at least 2 feet apart. Also make sure the door jam/frame is strong enough it wont splinter if the locks get kicked. Think about running a thin metal strip down the side that will hold the frame together to prevent kick ins. Be able to see who is at the door before you open, maybe a small window in the door or a spy hole or video camera. Maybe a door chain or something so you can open it a bit while still being safe. However THE MOST IMPORTANT thing is make sure you have a smoke alarm fitted and check it works and get a small fire extinguisher and fire blanket for the kitchen. Also window locks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a Brit I find the fact that Americans actually have a Christian right political force to be amazing. The stuff Ted Cruz was into would make him unelectable to a town council outside of Northern Ireland. As far as the politics in the UK are concerned it is more of an ethnic thing rather than a religious belief thing so more like someone identifying as hispanic so some mexicans will vote for him rather than him saying I am Catholic so vote for me. Also politics is filled with british people of pakistani origin so are the universities, public sector and local councils. Despite what those trying for victim status say they are well represented and are as rich and powerful as  anyone else in UK. There are no parallels with the USA system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Artillery in battle is used on an area of ground rather than a specific individual target. So you might fire it at tanks to make them close down their hatches, try to damage their optics and radios making it easier for anti tank weapons engage them. Or use it on a piece of ground to direct the enemy into a killing zone. Or to suppress an enemy position while you move troops to assault it (or withdraw). It does all these things in all weathers whilst out of sight of the enemy and very cheaply compared to multiple layers of ground attack aircraft. Also good at providing smoke and illumination. Plus it is probably part of the ground troops own formation so is more likely to be there all the time when air power might not be. In a modern war it is still useful, even in counter insurgency where you probably wouldn't use multiple gunlines pre smashing the target area because of civilian casualties. You could put it in a remote location (very little maintenance or support required) and be able to hit enemy mortar, rocket firing positions that would be out of range of infantry weapons (even anti-tank weapons like Javelin). 

TL:DR Very useful. Artillery is cheap, all weather, out of sight, easy to maintain, a very good area weapon and very good at supporting ground troops.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it is happening but nothing to do with government more to do with corporate interests and the workplace thinking it should own peoples entire lives and everything they say. You boss wants your fb? For instance I see one of the biggest threats from big data comes from insurance companies getting access to health reports. Imagine not being able to get a mortgage or a job because of a bit of DNA and potential genetic risk. The terror Americans have about their credit rating and the impact it has on them, way worse than anything in Europe, is worrying. So I don't really think Govt spies are a worry, more the workplace owning more and more of our existence. 

Imagine if your boss could just buy your social profile because you might control a cash drawer. GCHQ will tell him to ram it but I imagine plenty of corporate security services would love to be able to data mine and sell all the stuff google and the rest of the internet economy has on you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nope because the stasi used the information to totally dominate and control the population, meeting with friends in East Germany and saying things like get rid of the state, I hate the government would quickly lead to serious pressure. Even if you think the evil western agencies have all the knowledge there are no consequences for the many who say get rid of the queen, tear down the state etc even reasonably violent protests only result in a handful of arrests and sentencing is fairly mild. People get longer in jail for putting bacon on the handles of a mosque than rioting in London. Imagine if you posted, I hate Gove save NHS evil Tories on Fb then the next day you went to work as a cashier or road sweeper and found you had been sacked and the council was maybe taking back your house that is how it worked under the stasi.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes but you have to be interested in running rather than it being a cardio component of your lifting plan. If you want to get better at running do it 2 or 3 times a week 5-7 miles once a week is not enough, you would be better doing 3 miles 2 or 3 times a week. Headphones on and a nice path/trail with no traffic then you get to zone out. 
But if you get that into running where after 30 or 40 mins you get that runners high and your body feels totally in sync and you feel you can push it; where it is only your mind that holding you back rather than pain in lungs/legs then you might be eating into those gainz. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely. Europe was ticking along making progress with virtually all religions becoming more and more chilled then all of a sudden, "FUCK YOU, ALLAH's HERE!!!!". For years if you said anything against Islam you were branded racist etc but the simple test I suggest to people is ask if Jews or Catholics were doing this would you be cool with it? I know why the left traditionally secular and anti-religion has embraced Islam but I don't understand it. Not all Islam is the same and there are branches that are chilled but unfortunately they are routinely killed by other Muslims for being more humanist. From Pakistan to Scotland Muslims that are similar to European ideas of religion and its place in politics are murdered.  </TEXT>

If another unknown man gets in his face that isn't looking like a pro heavyweight MMA fighter there is every chance he is going to get a beating. When men chat shit and get in each others face it will often lead to violence. White knighting is fine online in the office etc but there is a chance you are going to get your ass kicked. Its not fair but if there is no physical violence sometimes best to not create it. Watch a cop show and see how hard it is to stop a gym freak kicking off. I know it is totally unfair but just pointing out that the people who watch bullying are not actually worse than the bullies.

The money laundering part is common to all crime gangs and might vary where you live but usually small cash transactions so traditionally pubs could run phantom stock through the books with a front man as licensee but any business could run extra phantom customers through it. It could be taxis, tanning salons, manned car washes or site security all of these industries are dominated by crime gangs in some big cities. And you wouldn't know as a customer but you would know if you tried to open competition. Remember it is not TV they don't need to launder truck loads of cash a lot of their money will disappear into the black economy, hookers, drugs and cash spending like flash holidays, clothes, clubs. Their cars will be leased so they only need to put through enough money to show they legally paid a mortgage, normal expenses and some legal cash to invest in more small businesses so these things won't be taken by the state if they get found guilty.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know where you live but much of the serious orgainised crime in many places is exactly from the Turkish/Kurdish diaspora who quietly import and wholesale the drugs. The piss poor immigrant who you think owns the kebab shop, barbers shop, taxi firm etc either is a front man or has borrowed money or rents from "friends" then runs a percentage of extra business through the till. However that only applies to the ones who are actually fronts for money laundering most aren't and far from being piss poor a decent takeaway will be raking it in. Plenty of owners nipping around in Mercs and BMs and plenty of cash business. 

But the point was that they wouldn't be there if no one ate from them - supply and demand - isn't as clear cut as you might think. </TEXT>

The original black character Winston in 1984 was less of a stereotype and basically represented the "everyman" character anybody could identify with. If he had been as cliched as the modern African American character they would have needed Flavor Flav to play him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Might have a space program but still third world.
Edit - Third world/ developing country blah blah. And the comment is based on the article. Did anyone read it? Poor animal control guy knows his stuff but is ignored by police and all the people there  which makes the cat freak out he is then badly bitten. Do the police take him to the hospital? No a bystander takes him to the hospital where the wrong type of doctor messes him up, then some members of the public try to take him to a proper doctor at a different hospital but he is not allowed to leave until he pays his bill for the crap treatment. But he lost his wallet in the cat attack and have the police by now found his money and rushed to the hospital to help him? No, a member of the public has to pay his bill before the shit hospital will let him go. These are the problems not the fact there was a leopard trapped in a building! The leopard was captured and moved deep into a forest park it is just a shame that the civil authorities response was so bad, feel sorry for the animal control guy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is actually very unbiased and news television has a legal duty to be factually correct and not misrepresent stories. Complaints can be made to a statutory body by individuals. Corrections are often reported and the whole system keep TV sane. People like Glenn Beck, who are not brave truth sayers challenging the system but news clowns acting a character to get ratings to generate profits for Fox media, would not be tolerated on UK TV. 

Google Katie Hopkins she is about as close to the right wing polemicist personality cult the UK has but still so far from the crazy right wing conspiracy market that Fox captures. Print media has a broader spectrum but even there it self restrains if it wants to be taken seriously.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There have been horrendous cases where social workers have "uncovered" satanic child abuse rings. The "evidence" is testimony from young children who have been taken from their homes, then questioned for months by the same social workers until they extract the required narrative. Some of the cases that went to court were thrown out by the judge when it became clear the social workers just kept asking leading questions effectively creating the whole satanic case. Some of the children had been in care so long by the time the case was thrown out they were never given back to their parents. It was found that the social workers involved were driven by ideology and dogma, turns out they were the real evil. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just so many of these comments make me think why have arctic sled dogs in regions that are hot? Oh but my huskies are fine in the desert cause I hose them down etc? Why not get a different breed that can cope with the heat better? Or do they cope fine with the heat? NO hate they are such awesome dogs so I can totally understand needing to have them anywhere you live. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But the articles have no substance. There are no details on what powers are being talked about. A few soundbites from politicians and some amusing polemic from a comedian do not construct an argument  and contain zero facts. The SNP continues to blame everything on Westminster and refuses to use their existing powers to raise new money to pay for their policies hence disastrous police reorganisation, massive college cuts to pay for free universities, a failing education system etc. The only economic levers they have pulled tinker with the cost of buying a house. The Scottish Government have frozen council tax and not used their powers to increase income tax. They don't even use the powers they have yet whine about wanting more. </TEXT>
