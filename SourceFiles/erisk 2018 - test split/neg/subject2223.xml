<TITLE> The /r/books book club selection for May is The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-28 20:59:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know many of you are likely familiar with this book and we are very excited to have Rebecca as our book club guest this month.  Feel free to discuss the book in the comments on this post.  

Even if you do not often read non fiction I highly recommend this book.  

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493208-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks):

Henrietta Lacks, as HeLa, is known to present-day scientists for her cells from cervical cancer. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells were taken without her knowledge and still live decades after her death. Cells descended from her may weigh more than 50M metric tons. 

HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bombs effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks was buried in an unmarked grave.

The journey starts in the colored ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s, her small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia  wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo. Today are stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells, East Baltimore children and grandchildren live in obscurity, see no profits, and feel violated. The dark history of experimentation on African Americans helped lead to the birth of bioethics, and legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The /r/books bookclub selection for April is Narconomics: How to Run a Drug Cartel by Tom Wainwright! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-31 18:18:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It has been a few months since we read some nonfiction so this will be a nice change of pace. Even if you don't usually read nonfiction this is something you should try out. It's an interesting read and quite entertaining.

From [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25159062-narconomics):

How does a budding cartel boss succeed (and survive) in the 300 billion illegal drug business? By learning from the best, of course. From creating brand value to fine-tuning customer service, the folks running cartels have been attentive students of the strategy and tactics used by corporations such as Walmart, McDonald's, and Coca-Cola.

And what can government learn to combat this scourge? By analyzing the cartels as companies, law enforcers might better understand how they workand stop throwing away 100 billion a year in a futile effort to win the war against this global, highly organized business.

Your intrepid guide to the most exotic and brutal industry on earth is Tom Wainwright. Picking his way through Andean cocaine fields, Central American prisons, Colorado pot shops, and the online drug dens of the Dark Web, Wainwright provides a fresh, innovative look into the drug trade and its 250 million customers.

The cast of characters includes Bin Laden, the Bolivian coca guide; Old Lin, the Salvadoran gang leader; Starboy, the millionaire New Zealand pill maker; and a cozy Mexican grandmother who cooks blueberry pancakes while plotting murder. Along with presidents, cops, and teenage hitmen, they explain such matters as the business purpose for head-to-toe tattoos, how gangs decide whether to compete or collude, and why cartels care a surprising amount about corporate social responsibility. More than just an investigation of how drug cartels do business, Narconomics is also a blueprint for how to defeat them.

Tom will be doing an AMA here at the end of the month so as you read keep in mind that you will be able to ask him questions later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I worked in bookstores for years and getting kids to read something that they would find interesting is such a huge thing.  A lot of people can't just start out reading serious things - it's better to read something like Sweet Valley or Goosebumps purely for enjoyment and they naturally become a stronger reader and have more confidence.  

I know there are people out there who don't appreciate Captain Underpants books but so many kids who really don't think they want to read find them appealing.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When she fell asleep, the world was doomed. When she awoke, it was dead.

In the wake of a fever that decimated the earths populationkilling women and children and making childbirth deadly for the mother and infantthe midwife must pick her way through the bones of the world she once knew to find her place in this dangerous new one. Gone are the pillars of civilization. All that remains is powerand the strong who possess it.

A few women like her survived, though they are scarce. Even fewer are safe from the clans of men, who, driven by fear, seek to control those remaining. To preserve her freedom, she dons mens clothing, goes by false names, and avoids as many people as possible. But as the world continues to grapple with its terrible circumstances, shell discover a role greater than chasing a pale imitation of independence.

After all, if humanity is to be reborn, someone must be its guide.

[From Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29806086-the-book-of-the-unnamed-midwife)

The special part of the /r/books bookclub is that you will get to talk to the author after reading the book.  Meg will be here to do an AMA on March 30th.  

The Book of the Unnamed Midwife won the 2014 Philip K. Dick Award and was listed as a Tiptree Committee Recommendation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Facebook links are not banned site wide but many communities do choose to ban them entirely because of the problems that can arise when people post something they shouldn't.  

A lot of things on Facebook would not break site rules if it's just someone posting a link like that facebook page for a public figure like a musician or politician.  What becomes an issue is when someone who is not a public figure is singled out.  Our personal info rules are meant to prevent harassment and witch hunting so it's important to keep that in mind.  

I've given a bit of a breakdown of what can be considered a public figure [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/5v4mry/reminder_no_posting_personal_information_you_will/de1zalk/?context=3) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The kind of Facebook page you describe would most likely be okay to post a link to but it would not be okay to dig through the people commenting there and post that to Reddit.  The personal info rules are meant to keep people from receiving real life harassment and stop witch hunting.  In general it's better to err on the side of caution when things involve personal info.  

A good way to gauge if someone's name is considered personal info is to do a quick google search.   If you find news articles, video clips of news stories, magazine stories, and other things from the media?  This person's name would likely not be considered personal info.  On the other hand if you find social media, LinkedIn, twitter, and some gossip on a blog that is a good indicator that this person is not a public figure and it's not okay to post their name.  

Often someone's name may not be considered personal info but the names of their kids, phone number, personal email, address, workplace, etc...  are very likely still considered personal and are not okay to post.

<TITLE> The r/books bookclub pick for February is Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-28 02:04:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We are really excited for this as our bookclub pick.  Many of us have read this already and we enjoyed it quite a bit even though we often enjoy very different books.  This crosses lines between genres and appeals to those who like more literary fiction as well as sci fi fans.  

Jeff has done an [AMA here in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3es2af/im_jeff_vandermeer_the_author_of_the_southern/) (Spoilers!) and I encourage you to check that out if you have already ready The Southern Reach Trilogy.  If you have already read Annihilation I encourage you to read it again.

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934530-annihilation):

Area X has been cut off from the rest of the continent for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; all the members of the second expedition committed suicide; the third expedition died in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another; the members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within months of their return, all had died of aggressive cancer.

This is the twelfth expedition.

Their group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain and collect specimens; to record all their observations, scientific and otherwise, of their surroundings and of one another; and, above all, to avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.

They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X deliversthey discover a massive topographic anomaly and life forms that surpass understandingbut its the surprises that came across the border with them, and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another, that change everything. </TEXT>

It looks like it is in a few [library collections](http://www.worldcat.org/title/island-of-sodor-its-people-history-and-railways/oclc/59229190) if you are nearby and can contact them you may be able to see it there.

<TEXT> Hey everyone - I get that a lot of these "medical" or self help books are of very questionable content but I am not going to get into banning books from here by subject matter.  That's a slippery slope and I will not go down it.

What you can do to combat questionable content:

- downvote it

- comment on it and tell people it's questionable.  Even include links to evidence of such.  

- post better things (you see a bunch of crap?  try to find something better to drown it out)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes authors or publishers reach out to me and sometimes I reach out to them.  Often I email someone at the publisher who knows reddit and ask them to help me get in touch.  Usually for bookclub I reach out to someone who has written a book I think a lot of people will like and is interesting.  

Once someone is interested we talk about dates and times to get something that works for the author.  Usually anytime that is good for them is good for me.  Bookclub AMAs are always at the very end of a month but other than that scheduling is very open.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't actually think the Chtorran ecology is evil - I am not convinced that what we have seen so far is even sentient.  Much of the ecology seems quite organized but so does a beehive or ant colony.  True evil requires higher though process than that and I don't think we have seen anything capable of that. 

I also think it's very likely that whatever the intelligence is behind then invasion is so fundamentally different in though process from humans that it may not even be capable of human evil.  If you can't comprehend evil can you actually be evil?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The r/books bookclub selection for January is The Dragonbone Chair by Tad Williams! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-30 22:26:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We have not read any epic fantasy for bookclub yet so I think this will be a nice change of pace.  Tad will be doing an AMA here on 1/27. 

[From Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91981.The_Dragonbone_Chair): 

With The Dragonbone Chair, Tad Williams introduced readers to the incredible fantasy world of Osten Ard. His beloved, internationally bestselling series Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn inspired a generation of modern fantasy writers, including George R.R. Martin, Patrick Rothfuss, and Christopher Paolini, and defined Tad Williams as one of the most important fantasy writers of our time. 

This edition features a brand-new introduction from Tad Williams' editor as well as the original introduction from Williams himself! 


A war fueled by the powers of dark sorcery is about to engulf the peaceful land of Osten Ardfor Prester John, the High King, lies dying. And with his death, the Storm King, the undead ruler of the elf-like Sithi, seizes the chance to regain his lost realm through a pact with the newly ascended king. Knowing the consequences of this bargain, the kings younger brother joins with a small, scattered group of scholars, the League of the Scroll, to confront the true danger threatening Osten Ard. 

Simon, a kitchen boy from the royal castle unknowingly apprenticed to a member of this League, will be sent on a quest that offers the only hope of salvation, a deadly riddle concerning long-lost swords of power. Compelled by fate and perilous magics, he must leave the only home hes ever known and face enemies more terrifying than Osten Ard has ever seen, even as the land itself begins to die.

After the landmark Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy, the epic saga of Osten Ard continues with the brand-new novel, The Heart of What Was Lost. Then dont miss the upcoming trilogy, The Last King of Osten Ard, beginning with The Witchwood Crown! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It may seem a little silly but [Anne of Green Gables](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45) or [Heidi](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781) could be a really good choice right now since you like classics and are interested in something a bit inspirational.  

Project Gutenberg has a ton of public domain classic that are downloadable for free and they [break many of them out into categories.](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Category:Bookshelf) that could help you pick something.    

I really like looking through the old books of fairy tales and mythology from there.  The [color fairy books are some of my favorite.](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Category:Bookshelf)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is an example of what a guide can look like: http://imgur.com/kYbvCvq

I have some templates and I set up a google doc and invite whoever will be working on it.  It's easy to customize with things like screenshots and examples of AMAs from your own community.   

Here is another version: http://imgur.com/6Pm51Ic

I can also show you how to make a pre formatted submission link like this (bad link gore):

Each community can be just a little different to do an AMA in so there are always small changes to be made.  Some people need slightly more help that others depending on how familiar they are with the site.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers by Mary Roach is our bookclub pick for December! AMA on 12/30 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-30 22:05:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We decided to choose Stiff as our read for this month but feel free to check out any of her books if you have already read that (I know many of you have) 

For those who are unfamiliar with Stiff I know it sounds morbid or possibly gross but I swear it's not!  Stiff is a very interesting look at what happens to bodies donated to science. 

More about Stiff from [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32145.Stiff): 

Stiff is an oddly compelling, often hilarious exploration of the strange lives of our bodies postmortem. For two thousand years, cadaverssome willingly, some unwittinglyhave been involved in science's boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. In this fascinating account, Mary Roach visits the good deeds of cadavers over the centuries and tells the engrossing story of our bodies when we are no longer with them.

If you are a long time fan and have already read all of Mary's other books check out [Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26530320-grunt) - this is her newest book.  </TEXT>

By the time the next holiday or whatever rolls around it's gone so we can get more. 

For someone else you can juts go with whatever you know they like.  Booze, cheese, candy, tea, coffee, etc....    </TEXT>

<TITLE> subject2223's special recipe for cranberries (making cranberry sauce is easy) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-22 17:31:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You will need:

 * 2 bags fresh cranberries
 * fresh ginger
 * 1 cup water
 * 1 12oz can frozen Orange Juice
 * maybe some sugar


Put the cranberries in a pot with the water and grated ginger (as much as you want a lot is good) and simmer until all the berries have popped and formed a thick jam. Add the frozen OJ and let it melt.  Heat it for about 10-15 minutes but don't let it boil.  The orange juice will make it bitter if it boils. Taste the cranberries to see if you need to add more sugar.  The OJ has quite a bit of sugar so you might not need extra but I added about 1/2 cup.  

I keep my ginger frozen so I have it whenever I want some.  I just grate it frozen into whatever I need it in.

<TEXT> First off not feeling like an adult is a pretty good indicator that you are doing okay :) I am still not sure how I ended up being trusted with adult responsibilities.  

Some general good things to be able to do: 

 - Make your own meals.  It's always cheaper and healthier to cook for yourself.  
 - Learn to be good at grocery shopping.  Figure out your staples and learn to be flexible with some things.  
 - learn how to make simple repairs and clean stuff properly.  The internet is awesome for this. 
 - Keep track of your finances.  Again the internet is a big help here.  /r/personalfinance has great resources for this.
 - Make sure to read and ask questions about all your employer's benefits.  Make sure to get dental and vision insurance if it's at all feasible.  
 - pick up after yourself 
 

There is really a ton of stuff.  Is there anything you feel particularly out of your depth doing?  Or things you think other people do but aren't so sure?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every day or every other day is going to be best.  Don't feel like you have to shower in the morning though - I have always showered at night.  It's relaxing before bed and I don't like getting up too early.  Figure out what time of day works best for you, it could be morning, evening, at the gym, etc....

1. Gift cards.  They want you to sell gift cards. 

2. Approach them and ask if they need help. Let them know closing time is in 5 minutes and help them get whatever they need. 

3. Make sure they know you are watching them - offer help and be friendly.  Get coworkers to offer to help them wherever they have scattered to.  (I believe this question is related to shoplifting) 

4. Stay within sight of the kid and get your manager.

5. Offer them a basket to carry things in.  If you saw what they got ask about it in a non accusatory way - "these blue sweaters are my favorite!  you should try one on!" 

6. Time to make sure everyone is on the floor.  Also make sure to greet them this is another "I am watching you" moment. 

7.  If a coworker is close try to ask them to answer.  If not politely tell the customer excuse me for just a moment, pick up phone, politely let them know you need to put them on hold and finish ringing up customer.  You may want to ask if you should answer the phone at all.  Often when you work the register you are not in charge of phones too.


In general when answering shoplifting questions:

 - give people baskets 
 - do not accuse anyone
 - if people are gathering shit offer to take it to the register for them.  
 - if they run let them go, never follow, never accuse anyone of stealing

<TITLE> The book club selection for November is Radiance by Catherynne M. Valente! She will do an AMA here on November 30th. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-27 20:41:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If you have already read this please do not post spoilers here.  I will be posting a discussion thread on Saturday where those who have finished the book can discuss it and include spoilers. 


#Radiance by Catherynne M. Valente: 


Radiance is a decopunk pulp SF alt-history space opera mystery set in a Hollywoodand solar systemvery different from our own, from the phenomenal talent behind the New York Timesbestselling The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making.


Severin Uncks father is a famous director of Gothic romances in an alternate 1986 in which talking movies are still a daring innovation due to the patent-hoarding Edison family. Rebelling against her fathers films of passion, intrigue, and spirits from beyond, Severin starts making documentaries, traveling through space and investigating the levitator cults of Neptune and the lawless saloons of Mars. For this is not our solar system, but one drawn from classic science fiction in which all the planets are inhabited and we travel through space on beautiful rockets. Severin is a realist in a fantastic universe.


But her latest film, which investigates the disappearance of a diving colony on a watery Venus populated by island-sized alien creatures, will be her last. Though her crew limps home to earth and her story is preserved by the colonys last survivor, Severin will never return.


Aesthetically recalling A Trip to the Moon and House of Leaves, and told using techniques from reality TV, classic film, gossip magazines, and meta-fictional narrative, Radiance is a solar system-spanning story of love, exploration, family, loss, quantum physics, and silent film.

[Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/kitty-genovese-murder-new-york-city-37-witness-503861)

Here is a summary from Wikipedia: 

In the early morning of March 13, 1964, at approximately 2:30 a.m., Genovese had left her job, and began driving home in her red Fiat. While waiting for a traffic light to change on Hoover Avenue, Genovese was observed by Moseley, who was parked in his car. Followed closely by Moseley, Genovese arrived home around 3:15 a.m., and had parked her car in the Kew Gardens Station Long Island Rail Road parking lot. It was about 100 feet (30 m) from her apartment's door, located in an alleyway at the rear of the building. As she walked toward the apartment complex, Moseley exited his vehicle, which was located at a corner bus stop on Austin Street, and approached Genovese armed with a hunting knife. Frightened, Genovese began to run across the parking lot and toward the front of her building located at 82-70 Austin Street, trying to make it up to the corner toward the major thoroughfare of Lefferts Boulevard, Moseley ran after her, quickly overtook her, and stabbed her twice in the back. When later confessing, Moseley said that his motive for the attack was simply "to kill a woman". Genovese screamed, "Oh my God, he stabbed me! Help me!" Several neighbors heard her cry but, on a cold night with the windows closed, only a few of them recognized the sound as a cry for help. When Robert Mozer, one of the neighbors, shouted at the attacker "Let that girl alone!" Moseley ran away and Genovese slowly made her way toward the rear entrance of her apartment building. She was seriously injured, but now out of view of any witnesses.

Records of the earliest calls to police are unclear and were not given a high priority by the police. One witness said his father called police after the initial attack and reported that a woman was "beat up, but got up and was staggering around".

Other witnesses observed Moseley enter his car and drive away, only to return ten minutes later. In his car, he changed to a wide-brimmed hat to shadow his face. He systematically searched the parking lot, train station, and an apartment complex. Eventually, he found Genovese, who was lying, barely conscious, in a hallway at the back of the building where a locked doorway had prevented her from entering the building. Out of view of the street and of those who may have heard or seen any sign of the original attack, Moseley stabbed Genovese several more times. Knife wounds in her hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself from him. While Genovese lay dying, Moseley raped her. He stole about $49 from her and left her in the hallway.[13] The attacks spanned approximately half an hour. Afterwards, "Genovese, still alive, lay in the arms of a neighbor named Sophia Farrar, who had courageously left her apartment to go to the crime scene, even though she had no way of knowing that [Moseley] had fled."

A few minutes after the final attack, a witness, Karl Ross, called the police. Police arrived within minutes of Ross's call. Genovese was taken away by ambulance at 4:15 a.m. and died en route to the hospital. She was buried in a family grave at Lakeview Cemetery in New Canaan, Connecticut.

Later investigation by police and prosecutors revealed that approximately a dozen (but almost certainly not the 38 cited in the Times article) individuals nearby had heard or observed portions of the attack, though none saw or was aware of the entire incident.  Only one witness, Joseph Fink, was aware she was stabbed in the first attack, and only Karl Ross was aware of it in the second attack. Many were entirely unaware that an assault or homicide was in progress; some thought what they saw or heard was a lovers' quarrel, a drunken brawl, or a group of friends leaving the bar when Moseley first approached Genovese.

I know this is not a unresolved case but what happened with the people who heard or saw Kitty's attack could be very relevant to a lot of other cases discussed here.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am very excited to announce that our bookcklub pick for October is The Troop by Nick Cutter.  The Troop is a perfect Halloween read if you are looking for something creepy.

[From Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17571466-the-troop)

Once a year, scoutmaster Tim Riggs leads a troop of boys into the Canadian wilderness for a three-day camping tripa tradition as comforting and reliable as a good ghost story and a roaring bonfire. But when an unexpected intrudershockingly thin, disturbingly pale, and voraciously hungrystumbles upon their campsite, Tim and the boys are exposed to something far more frightening than any tale of terror. The human carrier of a bioengineered nightmare. An inexplicable horror that spreads faster than fear. A harrowing struggle for survival that will pit the troop against the elements, the infected...and one another.

<TEXT> /u/SkippTopp is right.  Our main concern is making sure people are not using reddit to hunt someone down and cause real life problems for them.  Links to documents will very often be okay but if it's posted to highlight the personal info that would likely be a problem.  

Posting home addresses or personal phone numbers on reddit is very rarely okay.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Posting links to documents can be problematic but we have decided that those are okay.  It is not okay to use information to start a hunt for someone and it is not okay to use reddit to search out more of their private info. 

What we are concerned about here is making sure people are not being harassed in real life based on activities here on reddit.

<TEXT> I just moved to the city from an area with almost no public transport.  It has been so nice to be able to get into the city without driving and parking.  The one less nice thing is the area immediately out side many stations.  Often it's not kept up very well and a lot of people congregate there who are not going to be riding.

What are your thoughts on the upkeep or the area around the station? Being such a high traffic area it can't be easy to maintain.  </TEXT>

From Peadar:

My novel, The Call, came out in North America yesterday and will be published in the rest of the English-speaking world tomorrow. I sometimes describe it as "a Harry Potter where everybody dies". The Call deals with the abduction of teenagers by murderous Irish fairies and takes place in a special boarding school that's trying to teach them to survive.
I've written lots of short stories and three other novels, all of which were part of The Bone World Trilogy.
Catch me online on Wednesday from 1pm EDT (that's 6pm in Dublin/London, 7pm Paris, Berlin etc.). I'll hang around for 2 hours if the questions keep coming.
Ask me anything!

<TEXT> #[The discussion thread for 14 by Peter Clines](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/515b2p/a_discussion_of_14_by_peter_clines_this_is_part/)

I know the description is a bit mysterious but I recommend not finding out too much about this book before you read it.  Better to see the story unfold without knowing whats coming or whats going on.  Just trust me, you will like this. 

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15062217-14)

There are some odd things about Nates new apartment. 

Of course, he has other things on his mind. He hates his job. He has no money in the bank. No girlfriend. No plans for the future. So while his new home isnt perfect, its livable. The rent is low, the property managers are friendly, and the odd little mysteries dont nag at him too much. 

At least, not until he meets Mandy, his neighbor across the hall, and notices something unusual about her apartment. And Xelas apartment. And Tims. And Veeks. 

Because every room in this old Los Angeles brownstone has a mystery or two. Mysteries that stretch back over a hundred years. Some of them are in plain sight. Some are behind locked doors. And all together these mysteries could mean the end of Nate and his friends. 

Or the end of everything...

<TEXT> #[Click here to visit the AMA and ask a question](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4yc5yl/im_carolyn_parkhurst_author_of_the_new_novel/)

From Carolyn:

Hi! I'm Carolyn Parkhurst, New York Times-bestselling author of the new novel Harmony, as well as three previous novels: The Dogs of Babel, Lost and Found and The Nobodies Album. I've also written a children's book, Cooking With Henry and Elliebelly, and my humor has appeared in The New Yorker and The Rumpus.
Harmony is about a family called the Hammonds: parents Alexandra and Josh and daughters Tilly (13) and Iris (11). Tilly is on the autism spectrum, and as her parents struggle with the challenges of raising her, they make the acquaintance of an enigmatic parenting guru named Scott Bean, who invites them to leave their ordinary life behind and join him in creating a "family camp" for families with special needs kids in New Hampshire. The story is told in alternating viewpoints by Alexandra (who tells the story of their life before they leave for the camp), Iris (who tells the story of what happens at the camp) and Tilly (who narrates from somewhere in the future).
I wrote this essay for the Wall Street Journal about what it was like to have my 14-year-old son, who has Asperger's and was my inspiration for the character of Tilly, read Harmony.

From Karen:

As director of the Center on National Security, I have spent years studying justice and law after 9/11. I have interviewed numerous policymakers and politicians, chronicled the incremental erosion of the rule of law and sat in the courtroom for dozens of terrorism and national security-related hearings. My most recent book, "Rogue Justice: The Making of the Security State," is the story of how American civil liberties were systematically lost after 9/11 and still have not recovered.

<TITLE> [crosspost] James Renner, Author of True Crime Addict: How I Lost Myself in the Mysterious Disappearance of Maura Murray, is doing an AMA in /r/books! </TITLE>

<TEXT> #[Click here to visit the AMA and ask a question](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4v6ivn/james_renner_here_author_of_true_crime_addict_how/)

From James: 

Hello, Books! James Renner, here. It's great to be back.
My latest is a nonfiction thriller. True Crime Addict is mostly about the strange disappearance of UMass nursing student Maura Murray and the creepy clues I discovered while researching her case. But it's also about my own obsession with true crime and where that came from (spoiler alert - some dark family secrets are revealed). As I was researching the case I was raising a child on the autism spectrum who began to exhibit violent behavior so the story of that journey is in there, too.
A quick summary for those unfamiliar with this unsolved mystery: One Monday in February, 2004, Maura Murray emailed her professors to let them know there had been a death in the family and that she would return to her clinicals at the end of the week. This was a lie. Nobody had died. She emptied her bank account and drove hours north, into New Hampshire, where she crashed into a snow bank in the small town of Haverhill, around 7:30 p.m. Somewhere between the time of the accident and the moment the first police officer arrived on scene - no longer than 7 minutes - she vanished, never to be seen again.
In the news, Maura was made out to be the All-American girl, perfect to a fault. But then I uncovered the fact that she was in trouble for credit card fraud and identity theft at the time of her disappearance. And she'd been having an affair with an assistant track coach, who said she sometimes talked about running away. There was plenty of reason for her to flee and start over, not the least of which was her family.
The New York Times reviewed True Crime Addict as part of a larger issue devoted to crime writing, which will be available in print on Sunday. They called it "shamelessly entertaining" and said, "James Renner is just plain fun to read." I've been a writer for 10 years, and this is my first Times review, which makes me quite giddy.
You can find all my books, including The Man from Primrose Lane, and The Great Forgetting on Goodreads and anywhere books are sold.
Ask me anything about the Maura Murray case, crime writing, research, publishing, my fiction, or Rampart.  </TEXT>

From the Team:

Hey Everyone,
Derek Young here (derekbruceyoung), designer and driver of Complete Control as seen on ABC's BattleBots.
I also was the designer and builder of Son of Smashy, the very first middleweight BB champion, Pressure Drop from Comedy Central's first season, and Complete Control versions 1-4 for Seasons 2 through 5. I'm a mechanical engineer who has built props in the film industry in Vancouver, built robots for bioscience research, worked on the worlds best electric superbike at Mission Motors and am currently a machine designer at Carbon3D, making 3D printing faster and better. I'm answering questions from the comfort of my couch in beautiful San Francisco CA. Personal website circa 2006: http://www.derekbruceyoung.com Fighting robot section: http://www.derekbruceyoung.com/robots/ Complete Control Facebook (many build pictures here!): https://www.facebook.com/completecontrolrobot/
Joining us will be team mates Ronen Sarig (robotronin) and Hanson Linek (plant_bot)
Ronen and I met while working at Mission Motors, an EV start-up in San Francisco. An electrical engineer by day, maker by night - I invited him to join the team for Season 1 (2015.) Ronen was responsible for the flamethrower (Blue Flame of Death), the electrical system, and a lot of the metal fabrication. http://www.RonenSarigDesigns.com
Hanson was brought in by Danny Haeg who he works with at the Tech Museum. A new addition to Mission Destruction, he joined up to help machining, welding and general fabrication. He made the button pushing finger.
Absent are Mission Destruction's other three members, Zacky Rubin, Danny Haeg and Super Intern Timmy who is actually in a yurt in Mongolia.

<TEXT> #[Click here to visit the AMA and ask a question](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4rkm0z/hi_im_brian_hastings_author_of_song_of_the_deep/)

From Brian:

I work as the Chief Creative Officer at Insomniac Games and am a first-time author with the novel Song of the Deep (available at Barnes   Noble.) I was one of the three original members of Insomniac when we began as a tiny startup company in San Diego developing a little-known game called Disruptor. Over the last twenty-two years Ive helped create nearly thirty games, including our latest one, Song of the Deep, coming out on July 12th on Xbox One, PS4 and Steam.
Song of the Deep was a very special project for our team. Its ultimately about the great lengths we will go to help the people we love, and it was originally inspired by my then ten-year-old daughter. Its the story of a girl whose father disappears at sea, so she builds a submarine to search for him and in doing so discovers a secret underwater world.
Im very grateful to have had the opportunity to write this book, as I used to dream of being an author when I was a kid. So this is literally the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. Its also been one of my favorite games to work on, and the game development team has done an incredible job with the art, music, design and programming. I couldnt be more proud of how it turned out. I think the book and the game ended up complementing each other really well, each revealing different secrets about the undersea world and the hero of the story, Merryn.

<TITLE> The /r/books bookclub selection for July is Planetfall by Emma Newman! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-01 05:09:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This month we have something a little different.  

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24237785-planetfall):

From the award-nominated author Emma Newman, comes a novel of how one secret withheld to protect humanitys future might be its undoing

Renata Ghali believed in Lee Suh-Mis vision of a world far beyond Earth, calling to humanity. A planet promising to reveal the truth about our place in the cosmos, untainted by overpopulation, pollution, and war. Ren believed in that vision enough to give up everything to follow Suh-Mi into the unknown. 

More than twenty-two years have passed since Ren and the rest of the faithful braved the starry abyss and established a colony at the base of an enigmatic alien structure where Suh-Mi has since resided, alone. All that time, Ren has worked hard as the colony's 3-D printer engineer, creating the tools necessary for human survival in an alien environment, and harboring a devastating secret.

Ren continues to perpetuate the lie forming the foundation of the colony for the good of her fellow colonists, despite the personal cost. Then a stranger appears, far too young to have been part of the first planetfall, a man who bears a remarkable resemblance to Suh-Mi. 

The truth Ren has concealed since planetfall can no longer be hidden. And its revelation might tear the colony apart </TEXT>

Ive helped build numerous technology businesses, survived dengue fever, translated Virgil's Aeneid from the original Latin, worked as an entrepreneur-in-residence at a venture capital firm, and explored the ancient Himalayan kingdom of Mustang.

<TEXT> We are very excited to be reading The Lions of Al-Rassan this month!

#[Discussion thread for The Lions of Al-Rassam by Guy Gavriel Key](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4ltery/bookclub_a_discussion_of_the_lions_of_alrassan_by/)

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104101.The_Lions_of_Al_Rassan):

The ruling Asharites of Al-Rassan have come from the desert sands, but over centuries, seduced by the sensuous pleasures of their new land, their stern piety has eroded. The Asharite empire has splintered into decadent city-states led by warring petty kings. King Almalik of Cartada is on the ascendancy, aided always by his friend and advisor, the notorious Ammar ibn Khairan  poet, diplomat, soldier  until a summer afternoon of savage brutality changes their relationship forever.

Meanwhile, in the north, the conquered Jaddites' most celebrated  and feared  military leader, Rodrigo Belmonte, driven into exile, leads his mercenary company south.

In the dangerous lands of Al-Rassan, these two men from different worlds meet and serve  for a time  the same master. Sharing their interwoven fate  and increasingly torn by her feelings  is Jehane, the accomplished court physician, whose own skills play an increasing role as Al-Rassan is swept to the brink of holy war, and beyond.

Hauntingly evocative of medieval Spain, The Lions of Al-Rassan is both a brilliant adventure and a deeply compelling story of love, divided loyalties, and what happens to men and women when hardening beliefs begin to remake  or destroy  a world.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [crosspost] Cate Cameron/Kate Sherwood, author of Corrigan Falls Raiders series and other YA, romance, and m/m romance novels, is doing an AMA in /r/books! </TITLE>

<TEXT> #[Click here to visit the AMA and ask a question](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4kyy6n/cate_cameronkate_sherwood_author_of_corrigan/) 

From Cate:  

Okay, I admit it, Im intimidated by this!
I mean, the legendary Reddit community is scary enough. (Ive been lurking around for a couple weeks, but damn, this place is BIG!).
And then add the other AMA authors into the mixPaulo Bacigalupi is here tomorrow? The Windup Girl author?!? Holy smokes. Hell have loads of intelligent things to say about climate change and how human society is totally entwined with our environment and how we can only adapt so much before we begin to fall apart. And I can tell you that hockey players are cute?
And was Charlaine Harris here the other day? Sookies mom. Im sure SHE didnt have anything interesting to talk about. (Alexander Skarsgard? Meh. If thats your type.)
But its okay, because the Reddit/books folks are kind enough to give me an example of the best AMAs from the past, so I can learn from those and things wont be scary at all. Except John Green? Khaled Hosseini? Dan Brown? --Okay, breath, Cate, thats fine, theyre very popular, but, you know, youre fine too. Youre okay.-- But then I see Margaret Atwood?!? Are you kidding me? Im Canadian! I cant I cant even Margaret Atwood?!? You expect me to be coherent when Im following in the footsteps of Margaret F-ing ATWOOD?!?
All right. Time to get myself under control. I have a different perspective than these authors. How about that? Im not a literary giant, not a master of my craft. Im a journeywoman. I work a full-time job, not writing. I have a couple different pen names and I write what I feel like and what seems to be selling at any given moment. I take my writing seriously and I care about my characters and I do my best (and I am in the running for a prestigious award this year, so suck it, Margaret Atwood! Youve never been a finalist for a Lamda Literary award!  well, okay, the Man Booker is pretty good, too. And I guess the Giller is nice. But, stillno Lammies, bitch!)
(Possibly I should have inquired about the Reddit/books policy on casual obscenities at some point. Especially when those obscenities are directed at National Treasures.)
Anyway. I write romance and YA romance as Cate Cameron (currently focusing on the Corrigan Falls Raiders series, with Winging It the most recent release), and m/m romance as Kate Sherwood. Im torn between being nervous that Redditors will ask really hard questions and being nervous that no one will ask any questions at all. MostlyIm here. Three hours, from 6:00-9:00pm EDT, May 25. Ask Me Anything.

Hey all! Bart King here. I write funny books for younger readers and immature adults. Disney Hyperion just published my debut novel, a humorous science fiction adventure called The Drake Equation.
Ive also written over seventeen other books, including The Big Book of Boy Stuff (which was once Amazons top-selling kids book), The Big Book of Gross Stuff, and the hilarious An Architectural Guidebook to Portland. (Its medium-sized.)
I taught middle school for many years, which is how I got into writing. My reluctant readers inspired me on many searches to find books that theyd find perfectly irresistible . . . and it inspired me to try my hand at writing some.
Feel free to post questions here now! Starting at 6 pm Eastern Time (3 pm Pacific), I'll start answering and sharing thoughts on getting started in writing, finding an agent, the writing process, my books, humor, kids . . . you name it!

From Jodie:

Hello, I'm Jodie. I wrote The Society and The Girlfriend Request. I'm a Pitch Wars mentor this year for YA, and I've been a submissions intern for a publishing house. I live in a small town in Pennsylvania and have two children. I have a background in education and mental health counseling, and since I write YA, I tend to draw upon this experience when I'm writing. I'm a total Netflix binge watcher, and love Gilmore Girls, One Tree Hill, Gossip Girl, Supernatural, Person of Interest, Criminal Minds, Revenge, and lots more. Really, my tastes run all over the place, depending what I'm in the mood to watch. I love to bake but not wash dishes. Coffee is one of my favorite food groups and I drink way too much of it when I'm writing.
I'll be starting at 6:30 pm EST and will be taking questions until 10:30 PM. I can't wait to hear your questions and chat with you! I hope you can join me. =)

From Tim: 

Greetings!
Stopping by this corner of the corner of the internet for the afternoon and happy to answer all questions you have for me. My latest work, Home Run, was released earlier this year and I'm currently continuing my tour of US middle schools with the hopes of inspiring young student athletes to pick up books - with the help of some NFL star-power.
I'll be returning here at 3pm to answer your questions and I'd love to touch on anything from my work as an author, to my former NFL days, to my work as a broadcaster, to my legal career and the crazy intersection between all four. This is my first time on Reddit, so you might have to bear with my at times but I am very excited for this session!
Bio:
After studying writing at Syracuse University where he was an All American football player, Tim was drafted in the first round of the NFL draft by the Atlanta Falcons where he was a top defensive player for eight years.
While Tim played in the NFL, he also studied law and began his writing career. By the time he retired from football in 1994, Tim had already published his first book and become a lawyer. In addition to those two jobs, he began working as a television broadcaster for FOX NFL Sunday and other shows, including Battlebots, Good Morning America, Court TV, A Current Affair, and most recently, Find My Family.
After writing more than a dozen books for adults, Tim began writing a series of novels for young readers set in a world of sports taken from his own experiences as an athlete and a coach. In the meantime, Tim has visited over 1000 schools and spoken to nearly a half million students across the United States about the importance of education and character, in addition to the joys and benefits of reading!

From L. E. Sterling:

Hi, everyone!
Im L.E. Sterling, author of the sci-fi Y/A novel, True Born, and Im here to answer your burning book questions!
But first, for those not familiar: True Born is the first novel in a YA sci-fi/fantasy dystopian series (also called True Born). Identical twins Lucy and Margot Fox are from Dominion Citys elite Upper Circle. Although the twins hope to be told they are Splicers at their Reveal party when they turn 18  those who can afford to have their DNA spliced, warding off the plague that is decimating the population  theyre put through round after round of testingand no one will tell them why. Meanwhile, as unrest among the dying Lasters (those who cant afford to Splice) rises to a fever pitch, the girls father hires a team of mysterious True Borns  genetically resistant to the Plague, but not entirely human, either - to watch the girls. From there the questions keep mounting: what threatens the girls security  and if they arent Splicers like others in their Circle, what exactly are they?
A little more about me: True Born (Bk1) hit stores two days ago (yay!). Im also the author of two previous YA novels: The Originals (under pen name L.E. Vollick), and Plutos Gate. I once taught a class on vampire literature and another on superheroes. I completed a PhD thesis on magic (seriously). I'm Canadian, but of no relation to William Shatner (he wishes!).
Im here to answer all of your burning book questions for a few hours (from 7:30 pm - 10:30 pm EST), so ASK ME ANYTHING!
Proof: P.S. I totally bragged about this event on my website here: https://le-sterling.com/2016/05/01/ask-me-anything-thursday-may-5th-2016/

<TEXT> #[Click here to visit the AMA and ask a question!](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4hn8r8/im_ryan_gattis_author_of_all_involved_a_novel/)

From Ryan:

Hello, Im Ryan Gattis, the author of ALL INVOLVED (optioned by Alan Ball   HBO), KUNG FU HIGH SCHOOL (acquired by The Weinstein Company)which is soon to be re-released in the United Kingdom as KUNG FU, as well as two crime novellas in a series called THE BIG DROP: HOMECOMING (1)   IMPERMANENCE (2). Im part of a street art crew in L.A. (http://www.uglarworks.com/) and a board member at 1888 (http://1888.center/), a Southern California literary arts non-profit.
True story: I once had my face rearranged so badly that I needed two facial reconstructive surgeries to fix it and the doctor who performed them told me Id never smell or taste again. He was wrong, thankfully. Im from Colorado originally, but am a huge proponent of Los Angeles and of tacosa tacoponent, you might say. Wait, no. Dont say that. That sounds like Im against tacos. Too close to opponent. Well work on it later in editing.
Ill be answering questions here from 10-11a PST, which is 1-2p EST,   either 6p or 7p in Europe, depending on where youre calling from. AMA, Redditors!
Proof: https://twitter.com/Ryan_Gattis/status/727484109027610624
About ALL INVOLVED: 6 days of rioting. 17 different narrators in the most diverse city on earthall just trying to survive. The novel is grounded in 2.5 years of research   background spent with former Latino gang members, firefighters, nurses,   other L.A. citizens who lived through it. It has won the American Library Associations Alex Award   the Lire Award for Noir of the Year in France.
Heres a TED talk I did about my journey to write this book, which included being summoned to a sit-down with a former South Central gang lord: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG3tp2oA3xo
For those unfamiliar with the scope of the 92 L.A. riots, the most destructive civic disturbance in U.S. history, heres some quick background: http://www.lariotsallinvolved.com/

<DATE> 2016-04-28 01:51:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We are very excited to be reading The Water Knife and talking to Paolo Bacigalupi this month.  Many of you may be familiar with some of his other books like [The Windup Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Windup_Girl) which won a Hugo and Nebula award in 2010. 

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23209924-the-water-knife):

In the American Southwest, Nevada, Arizona, and California skirmish for dwindling shares of the Colorado River. Into the fray steps Angel Velasquez, detective, leg-breaker, assassin and spy. A Las Vegas water knife, Angel "cuts" water for his boss, Catherine Case, ensuring that her lush, luxurious arcology developments can bloom in the desert, so the rich can stay wet, while the poor get nothing but dust. When rumors of a game-changing water source surface in drought-ravaged Phoenix, Angel is sent to investigate. There, he encounters Lucy Monroe, a hardened journalist with no love for Vegas and every reason to hate Angel, and Maria Villarosa, a young Texas refugee who survives by her wits and street smarts in a city that despises everything that she represents.  With bodies piling up, bullets flying, and Phoenix teetering on collapse, it seems like California is making a power play to monopolize the life-giving flow of a river. For Angel, Lucy, and Maria time is running out and their only hope for survival rests in each others hands. But when water is more valuable than gold, alliances shift like sand, and the only thing for certain is that someone will have to bleed if anyone hopes to drink.  </TEXT>

From Charles: 

Firstly, a special thanks to any night-owls dropping in from earlier time zones, as well as to early-birds from later ones.
I suspect a lot of todays questions will be about the Caine Riordan/Terran Republic series, the third of which, Raising Caine, is up for the Nebula right now. I also write with Eric Flint in the NYT best-selling Ring of Fire/1632 series, and with Steve White in the NYT best-selling Starfire series. Or you may have seen my science fiction in Analog, and various anthologies.
Im also a (non-teaching) Distinguished Professor of English and a five-time Fulbright recipient. I received the American Library Associations 2006 Choice Award for Best Book, Rumors of War and Infernal Machines. I also designed and wrote for various RPGs and worked in film and video in the 80s and early 90s, and currently serve as a subject matter expert for both government organizations and national media venues.
Lastly, I have to prove Im who I say I am, so heres a link to not only my FB page, but one of my posts announcing this AMA session:

<TEXT> #[Click here to visit the AMA and ask a question!](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4ew65l/im_holly_jennings_author_of_arena_ask_me_anything/)

From Holly:

Hi, I'm Holly Jennings. My debut novel Arena was just released on April 5. I've also authored several short stories, though lately my focus has been on novels. Arena was inspired by the growing popularity of eSports and the emergence of at-home VR technology. I predict (and hope!) it will only be a matter of time before they converge, and gamers will be competing against each other in virtual space.
As the firstborn of a sports enthusiast, it wasn't long before my father discovered that the only games I'd ever learn to conquer involved consoles and controllers. I enjoy most kinds of video games, other than horror and anything turn-based. My recent favorites are Fallout 4 and GTA V. I was also not addicted to WoW for many, many years.
Random fact: I love robots, Firefly, and my grandma, but not in that order. Besides writing and gaming, I also enjoy several other creative hobbies like drawing, reading, and landscaping  though I've yet to plant anything that lasted through the year. My current obsession is Orphan Black.
I will be here 2:30-4:30 PM ET to answer your questions! </TEXT>

From Josh:

Hello Reddit/Books! I'm Josh Vogt, author of the urban fantasy series, The Cleaners, which launched last year with Enter the Janitor and has Book #2, The Maids of Wrath, coming out today. I'm also the tie-in author of Pathfinder Tales novel, Forge of Ashes, as well as the first HC SVNT DRACONES novel, Fate's Fangs.
I also moved to the Seattle area late last year to work full-time for Paizo, as an editor for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. You can find a decent rundown of myself and my work through my website: JRVogt.com or on Twitter via @JRVogt
When not reading or writing, I'm often exploring my new hometown, training for my next mud-run/obstacle course race, searching for a new seafood restaurant to indulge in, or trying to improve my extremely amateur fly-fishing techniques.
Oh, and for anyone interested, I'm currently holding a Goodreads giveaway for Enter the Janitor.
So, ask me anything! </TEXT>

<TEXT> #[Click here to visit the AMA and ask a question!](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4dmloc/hi_everyone_im_adam_mitzner_the_author_of_the/)

From Adam: 

Im Adam Mitzner, the author of The Girl From Home, which came out yesterday, and three other legal thriller novels  A Conflict of Interest (2011), A Case of Redemption (2013) and Losing Faith (2015). In addition to writing legal thrillers, Im a full-time practicing lawyer at a New York City law firm.
Im happy to talk with you about anything  writing, the law, Batman, how to start a novel, how to get it published, you name it.
First, a tiny bit about my books. I write thrillers with a legal bent, but I prefer to think about them as first and foremost, character driven stories.In my first book, A CONFLICT OF INTEREST, I wrote about a man who was on the path to success, and then through a series of bad decisions lost his way. For my sophomore effort -- A CASE OF REDEMPTION -- I started out the other way  focusing on a character that had lost everything before the book opens, and was trying find his way back. LOSING FAITH is about a man who has reached the pinnacle of his professional, and explores how fragile such a high perch can be, and the lengths he and those who love him will go to hold on to it. Finally, in my most recent book  THE GIRL FROM HOME  the protagonist is a man whos willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants, and through the course of the novel hes confronted with the price to be paid for such life choices, and whether hes capable of changing his ways.
I'll be on Reddit for the next three hours or so, and Ill answer questions about writing, the law or Batman (or something else if I know anything about it), so just ask! </TEXT>

<TITLE> The /r/books bookclub selection for April is Dead Wake by Erik Larson! He will be doing an AMA here on April 27th. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-30 01:38:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This month we are excited to be featuring a nonfiction book for the first time! Erik Larson's writing style is very readable so even if you don't read a lot of nonfiction I encourage you to give this a try.  

#[Link to the discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4dx7jj/a_discussion_is_dead_wake_by_erik_larson_the/?)

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22551730-dead-wake):

On May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the eras great transatlantic Greyhoundsthe fastest liner then in serviceand her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. 

Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwiegers U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly smallhubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and moreall converged to produce one of the great disasters of history.

It is a story that many of us think we know but dont, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love. 

Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history.

From Wendy:

Proof of me is in the link below! I started writing later in life, in my forties, after leaving a twenty-five plus year career as an actress in regional theater, Off Broadway, on Broadway, TV and commercials. My other work has been published in Redbook, on Powells.com and in the Los Angeles press, where I live with my screenwriter husband and our two kids. My first memoir CHANEL BONFIRE was about my fabulously neglectful childhood, being dragged around the world by my chain-smoking, bipolar, trophy wife mother - just trying to stay alive and get my homework done. The second, HEART OF GLASS, picks up where CHANEL left off as I move to New York in 1980, trying to find an identity, a not mean or crazy boyfriend (this proved to be quite difficult) and some kind of fulfilling work as an actress. I made many mistakes, slept around - looking for love in all the wrong places, and had run ins with the police, jaded rock stars and of course my psychotic mother who screeches through the story periodically to make me feel small and unloved. I can answer questions on publishing, agents, bad boyfriends, failed birth control, acting, Hollywood, substance abuse, and being a mom raised by a mom who was nuts. Looking forward to your questions!

From Shawn:

My name is Shawn Speakman. And I lie for a living.
When I tell people that, they assume I'm either a politician or a lawyer. I get the sideways look like I'm a demon or some kind of virulent pathogen. I always chuckle at that. But a fiction writer lies more, I think, if to less damaging effect.
Besides webmastering for Shannara author Terry Brooks and writing my own novels, I enjoy editing anthologies. Unfettered published several years ago -- put together to end medical debt I had accrued from treating cancer -- and it features a powerhouse line-up of sci-fi/fantasy authors. And now that Unbound is newly published, the wonderful people here at r/Books have asked if some of the anthology's contributors would stop by to answer your questions about Unbound, books in general, the craft of writing, or whatever you want to discuss!
Unbound is a themeless anthology because I sincerely enjoy reading what writers can come up with if they are given no restrictions. Short stories can be powerful and I think those in this anthology are </TEXT>

From Laurel:

Hi, Im Laurel Saville, the author of two novels, a memoir, several design books, and essays, articles and short stories. I've been all around the fast-changing world of publishing, from NYC agent, to work-for-hire, self-pubbing, and now, I am happily being published by the Amazon imprint, Lake Union. I'm also a brand communications consultant and have been a full-time writer for about a dozen years. I've lived in LA, NJ, VT, NY and now WA, have a BA in English Lit from NYU and an MFA in creative writing and literature from the Writing Seminars at Bennington College, and am getting a certificate in my other passion, Applied Animal Behavior. I volunteer with two shelter organizations where I work on re-habbing rescue dogs and helping new adopters live happily with their dogs. I live with 2 dogs, 1 cat, 4 ducks and 1 husband on an island in the Puget Sound.
You can find more about me at www.laurelsaville.com. Ask me anything. (I'll be here at about 2 pm ET to begin answering questions).

<TITLE> [crosspost] What if North Korea imploded? Military fiction writers Larry Bond and Chris Carlson are doing an AMA in /r/books! </TITLE>

<TEXT> #[Click here to visit the AMA and ask a question](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/49j7zg/what_if_north_korea_imploded_we_are_military/)

From Chris and Larry:

In 1989, military thriller RED PHOENIX showed what might happen if North Korea invaded the South as it did in 1950. That was the threat the Republic of Korea and its ally, the United States, planned and trained for. Our sequel to the original, RED PHOENIX BURNING, showcases how another scenario has emerged: Instead of invading the south, what if the Northern regime imploded, disrupted by a coup or some other form of internal stuggle? We both served in the Navy, and although we were in different communities (subs, destroyers), we both bring a "military mindset" to our writing. Were excited to share with you and will be answering questions until 4:30pm Eastern time (1:30pm Pacific). Ask us anything!
