<TEXT> There has also been a lot more weird shit that has been happening. There is a club across the street that is abandoned called club cognac, that was shut down because the security guard shot and murdered a lady. There is also this weird attic inside of the kitchen closet. There is no other door to get up there. Me and my boyfriend hear footsteps and knocks above us, usually every single night.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Guys I am seriously freaking the fuck out as I am typing this.

 Me and my boyfriend (we can call him J) were sitting in bed, he was playing a game, and I was eating a bowl of cereal. That was when he got a call from his mom, saying that his job had called her. He said that was odd because they didnt call him, mind you this is like at 10:15, and J never works at night. They chit chatted for a bit then ended the call, when J recieved a notification that he had one missed call. It was his job. He hadnt heard his phone ring, or anything.
 
So J calls his job, and the first thing he hears is a shrieking, scream. It was so loud I could hear it from across the bed. Chills went up my body and down my spine. We looked at each other in daft confusion, and he waited another moment for the dial tone. He hung up, and then his phone said that the call had failed.
 
 Luckily enough, J has a friend who works the night shift, and J shot him a text asking what the fuck was up? He explained the situation to his friend, and said friend went to find the supervisor. The supervisor said that no calls had been made, nor received. Guys that isnt even the weird part, his job doesnt have his moms cell phone number. At this point we are totally freaked out, I mean what could be the explanation for this?
 
This isnt the first time that weird shit has happened to us though. The other month we were in the same sort of situation. I was sitting on the bed, with my back up against the wall when I felt a solid thud. I mean I felt that shit physically. J heard it clear as day as well and we both lurched up and away from the window. Then we heard a tugging on the back door. We called his dad and one of my friends, and they came over and checked the place out. There was absolutely nothing, and I dont know if at this point we are just going crazy, if I am being paranoid, or if I am overreacting? Im so scared right now I dont even want to go into the bathroom alone, he has one of those foggy windows in there right beside the toilet. I am terrified of looking up and just seeing a face pressed up against it.

 Oh also there is one more thing, there's a GOAT HEADED BLACK MOLD SHAPE IN THE ROOF OF HIS CLOSET. I can shoot a picture out if you guys want, once i figure out how to do that since ive never posted to reddit before. Could that be it? Do we just have black mold poisoning, are we hallucination? As I am typing this, I feel like I hear footsteps in the kitchen and little knocks. I dont even want to mention it to J, because I dont want to freak him out more than he already is.
 
If anything else weird happens I will keep you guys posted. I just dont know what the fuck is happening.

<TEXT> I puked more when i lifted my hand from the remnants of my father's skull to attempt and get up. I wanted to cry, to scream, but I only felt searing, white wash anger. 
He looked at my expression and let out a loud laugh, short and high pitched. His parents watched beside him as i struggled with my grasp on reality. They were serial killers. They viciously murdered my parents, and now they are going to do the same to me. 


It was the mother this time who met my eyes, she came closer to me and leaned down until i could smell her rotten breath. Her evil eyes traced me, i snarled, and spat in her face. Her son roared and charged me on all fours like an animal. He put his mouth on my arm and took a bite of my flesh like it was cotton candy. My blood spluttered out, adding to the pool on the floor, and on his face. I grabbed my wound and kicked him and his mother square in the face. They fell back and knocked into the father who was already on the move to strike. I leaped up and ran past them, her gnarled fingers catching my ankle. I toppled down the flight of stairs, and managed to keep crawling until i could come to a stand. Somehow i was quicker than them and ran out of that god forsaken hell and onto the streets.

 
This time i didnt scream for help I just ran. I had nowhere to go, no phone, no parents, and very little sanity left. I heard their footsteps behind me, catching up. All I needed to do was hit the main road and hopefully, they wouldnt be dumb enough to follow me. I was running on pure adrenaline, my mind and body was acting on pure survival instinct. Cars were passing by, and my heart jumped out of my chest before my arms flailed for help. 


Unfortunately the family was behind me,and they were close too. I ran out in front of the next car that was approaching and it shrieked to a halt. I could see the person in the car was absolutely terrified and I screamed that there were people chasing me, trying to kill me. By now they had caught up and the person in the car was so bewildered that she tried to drive away, but the son smashed himself through the windshield. I watched as they ganged up on the woman inside of the car, and beat her until her head collapsed onto the steering wheel. The car horn was sounding around me like a siren, and I turned and ran in the other direction as fast as I could. 


Why me? Was all i could think as my bare feet hit the concrete painfully in each step. I looked back and they had threw the womans dead body onto the road and commandeered her car. They were now heading straight towards me heading about fifty miles an hour. 
Another car was on coming the opposite direction and i just prayed to whatever god was out there that they saw what was happening. I flung myself out of the way as the family passed me, barely escaping death. They slammed the car into the other, flipping it twice. I stood watching in horror as the son turned to me a second before it happened and smiled that sadistic smile of his. Surely the person in the other car was dead from the impact of a head on collision. I didnt even bother to stick around and check to see if i was right.


I had ran about 2 miles, and luckily I knew up ahead was a convenience store that would be littered with people and a phone. My arm and feet were soaking with blood, and my clothes the same. I looked like i had just been baptised in it. I checked behind my shoulder to see if they, by some chance of god were following me. They were nowhere to be seen. 
I hobbled into the bright lights of the gas station, my feet no longer covered by skin. The people who were standing by the gas pumps, mindlessly filling their tanks, gawked at me. I stared right back at them as I walked past and into the store. The guy behind the counter immediately noticed me and rushed around with a double barrel shotgun. I held up my hands in innocence and stammered that I just escaped kidnappers. That sounded better than I just ran two miles from fucking lunatic serial killers. The customers in the store had stopped what they were doing and were know watching the events unfold. 


The kind man who introduced himself as brian, called the police and let me wait in the breakroom while we waited. He bandaged up my arm and my feet in a combination of horror and disgust.

You poor boy, I am so sorry. Did you recognize them? I nodded, and told them exactly who they were. He tied up the end of my bandage and sat back on his heels, searching my eyes with furrowed brows.

Are you one hundred percent sure? Did he not believe me?

Yes, I can describe the way their house looks, the inside, the pictures on the wall, anything.When the police get here I can take them to where the bodies are, and where they wrecked into another car on the way to kill me. He looked solemn, as if his mind had just shut down trying to process the information I just slammed on him. He rubbed the back of his neck in anxiety,

They always seemed like such nice people, I mean the son was a little wonky, but still. I narrowed my eyes,

You knew them? He nodded slowly,

It's a small town boy, everyone needs gas or a pack of cigarettes. Their son Andrew always came in and bought a pack of starbursts and a strawberry cream soda every sunday after church. 

I had to hold back broken laughter, they actually went to church? How the fuck did they not burst into flames upon walking into Gods territory. Those people had to be some sort of branch of satan's offspring. 


The police arrived, and I told the story once more. The sheriff appeared as if he was going to be sick. His thick black moustache wiggled as if it was trying to escape his face. The sheriff and brian met eyes. 

Alright, you feel comfortable with showing me where everything happened? I will also need to get an official report. I shook my head. I thanked brian for helping me, his face was decorated with timid worry as I trailed behind Sheriff Langston. 


Two miles in we saw the car that the family had shamelessly wrecked into, still smoking on the side of highway 24. There was no sign of them, but the car they had stolen was piled in the ditch. The front end was almost completely destroyed, the airbags were deflated, and the windshield was just, gone. 

There is no way they could have survived right? I asked nervously, praying he would say no. Langston looked over at me in disbelief.

Kid, I really wanted to believe you made this up. My eyes widened, and I threw my hands at the scene in front of us. 

Now do you believe me? 

They killed my parents, and however many other people, and tried to kill me. Saying my parents were dead was the most horrid taste i have ever had on my tongue. I choked back a cry as I tore my face away from the sheriffs. 
He called for backup, and an ambulance as he surveyed the scene.
 
They killed the lady who was driving this car. I said as i accompanied him, not really wanting to sit in his car alone. Her poor, helpless face was forever seared in my mind as i watched her die. I never should have tried to stop her, it was my fault she was dead. Shit, she probably had a husband and kids. Now those kids were without a mom, just like me. 
I was an orphan. 
I took Langston to where I assumed her body would be. We searched the road and followed a blood trail into the ditch on the left side of the road. Her body lay still, with her eyes wide open still in horror. She must have still been alive when they threw her out of the car, and tried to crawl away from the road. Somehow that made it even worse.


Backup finally showed, along with the swat team and me and the sheriff got back in his car. The three minute drive felt like an hour, as I dreaded every second of anticipating seeing their faces once again.

Theyre probably long gone by now. I muttered. He half shrugged.

There will still be evidence all over the house, blood is hard to completely erase. There also should still be saliva from the son on your arm, if he is in our system thats proof enough for a warrant.

 I sighed, and stared ahead as we pulled onto my street. Except it was no longer my street, no longer my home, but a horrible reminder that I was completely alone.
Langston reeved it, and raced into their yard, followed by the swat and a few other cop cars. The swat hopped out of their van and ran into the house like a stampede of bulls after a matador. 

I want you to stay here. Langston said firmly, his hand on his gun.

No, I want to see them die. I whispered, not really to him, but to myself. He pointed his eyes at me, and his lips grew tight. Somehow I felt like he understood that. Before he could say anything else, there was a loud explosion inside the house. We both immediately looked up to see flames erupting from the windows where the glass was blown out completely. 

Son of a fucking bitch. Langston cursed and jumped out, as he was running up to the house, one of the swat men crawled out of the house. His protective gear was all but gone, and he struggled to take off his helmet as Langston approached him. I got out of the car and joined Langstons side, as we knelt by the man. A few other cops had arrived at this point, and the other cops were gathering around. The neighbours were coming out of their houses and onto the street to rubberneck on the scene.  

What happened? Langston asked in grave concern. The mans face was sweltered up from the blast, he was wheezing, and gasping for air. Langston looked back at the other policeman and nodded towards the back of the house. They drew their guns and quickly went to scope out the rest of the scene. It was just us and the man now. 

Theyre all dead, everyone of them. He wheezed, tears welling up. Lanston called another ambulance and the fire team to the address over his radio in a violently calm voice. I looked at his face, he was scared. It was horrifying seeing a grown man- a grown police officer so terrified. 


The smoke from the house was billowing up to the sky now, like some sort of signal from god to stop this nightmare. 
I was too focused on the sky, to realize that the man had took his final breath. Langston closed his eyelids in respect, and stood to his feet. He looked at me with the most peculiar look in his eyes, and said,

I want to see them die too. Upon hearing his words, something inside of me snapped. It may have been the little sanity I had left, or the pieces of humanity that my parents and the world taught me. Either way, both were gone. The officers returned from their perimeter search, and brought a note to the sheriff. The officer who handed langston the note, almost couldnt even hold it,because his hands were trembling so hard. I stood beside him, and we read it,


Help me, help me, is what you all will be saying. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was reading in my dimly lit room, when I heard the slightest noise on my bedroom window. I propped my book up on my knees and looked towards the source of the noise. My parents were gone to dinner at the hole in the wall diner in the middle of our sleepy little town. I checked my phone, no texts, no notifications, nothing. The only thing that met my eyes was the time, which was later than I had expected. I felt my brow raise in surprise at the amount of time my parents had been gone. I brought myself to get out of the comfort of my bed and peeked through my blinds to see if my parents may be coincidentally pulling in, as if on cue.

I checked the street, which was barren. I narrowed my eyes at something underneath the streetlight. As I leaned in to get a better look, with my nose pressing against the glass and my breath nearly fogging up my view, I saw the silhouette of a man. Chills raced over my body, freezing my blood solid. I felt my eyes bulging out of their sockets, daring to get a better look at what i was seeing. As I sat mouth open, eyes wide, it waved, long and slow at me. I fell back from the window straight onto the tip of my tailbone and crawled backwards in front of my bedroom door, too terrified to act.

Holy shit. I whispered to no one but myself. I crawled back to my bed on my hands and knees, hoping he couldnt see me. I reached my hand up and searched blindly for my phone. Relief temporarily washed over me as I felt its cold frame in my trembling hand. I instantly called my dad, praying he would fucking answer. Straight to voicemail.

Fuck. I cried silently, the tears were beginning to fall. The fear within them seared my eyes and I questioned whether or not to call the police, or if I was overreacting. I had always scared so easily.

The courageous part of my mind urged me to take another look to see if he was still out there, under the light. What if he was? But then what if he wasnt? I compulsively looked at my phone every second, begging to see my father calling.

Tap tap

My heart stopped. The sheer terror lurched my stomach into my throat and I held back a gag. I couldnt move. My limbs wouldnt work, like the nerves in my body evaporated, and my muscles had turned to dust.

There was no fucking way I was going to pull open my blinds and face whatever was out there. Struggling to snap myself into reality I looked down at my phone in my hand. I attempted to text my dad, but my fingers were shaking so bad as if I was seizing. I sent him numerous, frantic texts and i just hoped my dad wouldnt think I was fucking with him. It seemed like hours had passed in the matter of seconds. I sat in deafening silence, my ears alert for anything. Nothing.

I sat helpless, and paralyzed, too afraid to leave the sanctity of my room. My parents had turned all of the lights off in the house before they left, since i usually dont leave my room this time of night anyway. Going out into the darkness seemed so harrowing. I got down as low as I could, until my chest was touching the carpet and hurriedly rushed over to the window, and listened. There was nothing, no knocking, no breathing, no shuffling, just silence. My eyes searched my room for something to cling to; when i saw a eye underneath my door. It wasnt just an eye, it was a nose, and half of a crooked smile. He was at my unlocked door, staring menacingly at me as i had sat listening for him. The most blood curdling scream escaped my body, as I jumped to my feet, immediately going for the window. I tore the blinds from the wall, and unlocked the window. I struggled to lift it up, since it had been painted over when we first moved in.I threw my eyes behind me to see if he was still there.

My bedroom door stood open. And the man underneath was no longer half hidden, he was fully in front of me. He was no more than six feet away, blankly staring into my eyes with his own cold, dead pair. He was wearing a long, flowing pastel pink dress with blood splattered all over it. His bleached blonde hair was pulled back behind his head. Those eyes. They bore into mine, as I felt that I no longer could escape.

What do you want? I asked him in a pitiful, dry whisper. The tears were pouring down my face and I knew I was about to puke. I searched his long, porous face for his intent. He only replied with widening his smile. He brought his tall, slender frame closer to me with a small step, as if he was taunting me. I screamed at him once more and flung my nightstand at him and threw my body out the window in a final attempt. I hit the ground running, and I ran, and ran and ran.

I looked over my shoulder to see if he was chasing me, and that he was. Except he was moving much quicker than i was.

HELP ME, PLEASE. I screamed at the top of my lungs as I ran down the street in my quiet little suburban neighbourhood.

HELP ME! My cries came out in a stutter as my lungs tried to keep up with me. I couldnt even feel the rocks tearing the flesh apart on the bottom of my feet, nor the winter chill on my skin. All I felt was pure, white horror.

He let out a joyous cackle, crazed and clear as he was beginning to catch up to me. My legs cried for me to stop, the feeling in my feet was long gone, my lungs were gasping for air. I had about twenty feet until i reached our neighbors house. Please, please, i whispered to my body. I leaped the last few feet onto their manicured porch and began violently beating on their front door.

HELP ME, PLEASE! My voice was hoarse, and brittle, but loud. I turned around for a second and he was racing towards me like an oncoming collision. I took everything i had and kicked him back off the porch as he tried to make it up the steps. He fell back a couple steps, My neighbors opened the door looking horrified as they saw what was happening. He met my eyes one final time and gave me the most ominous, sprawling grin a person could form. He pulled at his face, scratching it with his untrimmed nails and blood immediately began pouring out. He leaned his head back and let out a feminine shriek,

HELP ME, HELP ME. He mocked, in a high pitch voice. Which was followed by a low, throaty growl. It rumbled in my skull like thunder; he shook his head back and forth rapidly as if he was a dog shaking a toy. Spit slinging from his mouth, he rolled his head around on his neck, laughing uncontrollably as me and my neighbors watched in awe.

When suddenly he stopped and stared at the sky, totally still. We watched both terrified and intrigued for what seemed like forever, when he began bolting towards us. They pulled me in and slammed the door. I closed my eyes waiting for him to flail his body on it, but it never came. I stepped back and looked at them, and they looked at me.

Thank you. I breathed, relief washed over me like i had just took a dive in a swimming pool. I had only met the two about three times at community gatherings and in passing. They were a gorgeous couple, probably in their late forties and had always seemed friendly.

Go call the police. The wife said gravely to her husband. He nodded, still looking a bit ghostly and headed into the kitchen. She motioned for me to sit on the couch furthest from the door,

Do you want some tea or anything dear? Her voice was soft and sweet like butterscotch, it relaxed me a little further. I shook my head and went to look for my phone. I patted my pajama pockets, confused. I knew i put it in there, but maybe it had fallen out as I was running for my life. Nervous laughter struck me, and im not sure if it was from the shock or the realization that i hadnt died. I just really need to call my parents. I said, looking at the door apprehensively. There was no way I was going back out there without being accompanied by my dad. I dont know if i could even go home again. His face flooded my mind like pain.

Youre okay now. She said, and put a hand on my back. She smiled at me at walked into the kitchen behind her husband. I thought it was odd I couldnt hear him talking to the police, i mean the kitchen couldnt have been that big and the house was small.

I began to bite my nails as I was waiting on the couple return to the living room, but not taking my eyes off of the door. I retraced his face in my brain, and recalled the blood on his dress, the way he screamed at the sky. The fact that he was in my house. How long had he been watching me? Who was he? I had so many questions, but honestly i just wanted to go home to the safety of my parents. They should have been home by now. I looked around the living room for a clock. My eyes landed on an old grandfather clock in the corner of the room, 11:32. You said you needed to call your parents? The wife asked, appearing out of the kitchen, startling me.

Uh yeah, if you dont mind. She just smiled at me, sort of complacently and handed me a cordless home phone. I returned her smile with tight lips. She left me with privacy, thankfully and i dialed my dads number. I listened to the dial tone as i stepped out of the living room and wandered into the hall away from the kitchen. They didnt answer so i dialed it again, and continued down the hallway. It was rather long and painted a dainty yellow, littered with pictures in nice golden frames. As i listened to the phone i looked at the pictures. I found one with the husband and the wife and what must have been their son.

Hello. A voice answered my fathers phone. The phone slipped out of my hand as I made the connection of the boy in the picture. The long sharp face, those dark beady eyes. The husband and the wife with their wide smiles, and long fingers on his shoulders. I heard his pious laughter echoing out of the phone as i looked at the picture beside that. It was the same one essentially except in this one the man had bleached blonde hair in ringlets, bright red lipstick and a face full of makeup. I watched as the couples shadows loomed above mine against the wall. I turned my head to look at them and they wore the same smile as their son. They began laughing psychotically, kneeling over grabbing at their stomachs as if terrorizing me was the most fun they've had in awhile.

What did you do to my parents? I asked, breathless. The air was vacuumed out of my body and it hung on the air like a mist. Their laughter abruptly stopped, as did the laughter on the phone. I heard a noise behind me, and turned, to see the man running at me from down the hallway.

I let out a growl of anger and took the picture off the wall beside me and smashed it in his face before he could come to a stop. His mother and father let out a screech of horror as he fell to the floor, writhing in agony as the glass dug deeper into his skin. Blood was pouring out onto the hardwood floor much more quickly than I would have expected. He began to beat his head on to the ground violently, pushing the glass further in, and producing more blood. The parents grabbed me from behind, the mother took me by my hair and the father dug his nails into the skin on my arm. I kicked and scratched at their clutches to no avail; all the while he had begun to beat his head on the walls, blood covering them like paint. I tried to land a blow on the mother as she began dragging me down the hallway past her son who had completely fucking lost it.

NO! I yelled, kicking him one last time as they pulled me down the hallway. The father struck me in the stomach as reprimand and I choked on my insides. The son stopped his blows and slowly, as if frame by frame turned his head towards me as his parents took me away. His face was almost unrecognizable, covered in blood from his flesh being torn to the bone. Bits of his scalp were missing from his brutal bashings, and a few teeth had fallen out. Glass had gotten lodged in his eyes, and blood was filling them, blanketing the white.

Help me, help me. He whispered swiftly, blood spluttering out like spit. I roared in rage as their hands tensed, they were beginning to drag me up stairs. I caught my hand on the wooden spools and anchored myself on the fifth step. The mother began beating me in the back of the head with all of her might, and as best I could I tried to dodge her blows. The father dropped his grip on me and I fell down hard on the corner of the step. Dazed from her blows and the pain from the fall i was beginning to lose strength. He pushed her out of the way and wrapped both of his hands in my hair and lurched me up the stairs, ripping my nails right off on the spools. I screamed in agony pulling my hand back, getting blood all over my face and clothes. The mother opened the door at the top of the stairs and the stench of iron, and decay filled my senses. I puked from the smell, the pain and the terror; my stomach was knotted in disgust and my body was beginning to go into shock. The two of them lifted me up and threw me onto a pile of something damp. The smell was so strong, like ammonia. It was completely black all around me and i tried to get up from where they had threw me. My fingers went into something wet and cold, like the insides of a pumpkin. I heard the son downstairs flailing once more, screaming in his feminine voice, HELP ME HELP ME. The father began walking towards me, stepping on my chest and compressing the last of the oxygen in my lungs out into a strangled gasp.

Click

It was the chain to the single lightbulb ahead, illuminating the room I was thrust in finally. I screamed.

Bodies upon bodies lay underneath me, covering the floor. Some were still intact as if they had only been dead for a few days but some were decayed beyond human recognition. Their eyes nothing but black holes, mouths hung open as if crying out. I whimpered as I realized what i had stuck my fingers in. I looked beneath me and there were my parents. Except it wasnt my parents anymore, their naked bodies lay at inhuman angle, heads smashed in. My father's jaw was crushed, and hung by the tendons from his skull, his teeth completely missing. My mother was completely void of flesh on her face and body all that remained was the tissue underneath, as if she was burned alive.

The son staggered up the stairs, and fell into the room on his hands and knees. I met his bloody eyes with hatred, and he inhaled deeply, aroused by the scent of so much blood. He was like a fucking rabid dog, and his parents were the creators of this demonic beast. He sat up and ran his hands over his body as if he was caressing curves,

You like my dress? He said through a teeth clenched grin. I ran my eyes over what was left of the dress once more, and the vomit came. The light pink, those pretty lace flowers, they were my mother's favorite combination. </TEXT>
