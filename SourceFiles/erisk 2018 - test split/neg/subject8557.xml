<TEXT> I personally believe that would make a good cover and Putin wins in this scenario as well. By and large most people have gotten over it and no major repercussions are getting much coverage. In fact, it's increasingly suspicious that trump has  forbidden the entry solely of news organizations that were covering the Russia ties, has court evidence of, shall we say, extremely fishy ties with upper echelons of Russian politics, and now he fires Comey and that's to say the very least. Add to that the attempt to control media portrayal of the administration, such as the fact that t_d is modded by radicals and manipulated by bots (to the extreme) and the willful ignorance and blind support of trumps supporters, and you've got a problem, to say the least.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. I don't think the "free market" is working according to its principles. Unnecessary procedures are common, doctors give prescriptions for pharmaceuticals from whom they receive commissions, pharmaceutical companies charge exorbitant and in no way ethical prices for drugs in the US only, the ability for insurance companies to charge similarly for preexisting conditions. These, among others, should be addressed by legislation, not only because the incentives for ethical business practices are insubstantial, but because this is a democracy and the vast majority(iirc) demands it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the point is here that health care is too expensive in America and not for any good reason. Saying they take cash snd nobody should expect anything for free is beside the point. We pay significantly more for particularly worse health care than anyone in the developed world. The reason for this is because the health care market has a high barrier to entry and limited competition and limited oversight. The government has implemented laws making things like food affordable and in my opinion, they should do the same with healthcare, especially after considering that many companies are solely in it for the profit as evidenced by the actions of pharmaceuticals, hospitals and insurance companies alike. </TEXT>

Thank you for your input: u/runningstitch , u/luckinthevalley , u/DoneUpLikeAKipper , u/floridianreader , u/Duke_Paul , u/katelindt . 

After some research, it appears that this was an attempt to bring some of Melville's hidden meanings to literature. There appears to be a theme of cannibalism and violence in this section of the book that contrasts with the peaceful serenity of the preceding chapters. The sharks, a continuation from the previous chapters, here appear to be reflecting the nature of man. When the cook, just a few pages prior, is speaking to the sharks under the capricious orders of Stubb, Fleece the cook says an angel is only a shark well governed. I believe that this comment is something of an insight into the cannibalistic theme of the book, that life eats life. This is further supported by the imagery from chapter 65 in which he remarks that the oxen at the market is a "brother" and the meat eaters "cannibals". 

   Further into the book, at chapter 96 The Try Works, we see the plot become more manifold by the introduction of the industrial aspects of the ship, representing its inherent opposition to the previous chapters' focus on an epic hunting journey. The fumes produced in combination with the line: "the Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commanders soul." Note that the Pequod replaces the whale's place as the antagonist. From this point onward, Ahab is seen in terms of mechanical and industrial images; as Dean Flower wrote in The Hudson Review: "iron rails, manufactured body parts, carpentry, hammer and forge". 
   To bring all this home, as Pip claims: "I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look," which brings full circle the concurrent, inseparable cyclical themes in the book of good and evil, cannibalism and brotherhood, serenity and terror. So, in conclusion, the "Ingin" god was an allegory to the cyclical themes of the book which explore the inherent duality of man and life.

<TEXT> Congratulations! Two questions:

1. From one guy with melanin in the skin to another, did you experience any racism on your trip? I have been considering a trip in the states, but grew up in a small town and, tbh, I'm afraid of these small town guys and their trucks, guns and sheriff's departments.

2. How much gear did you take? It looks like you traveled super light in the pics.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I considered that Melvile may (very well) have been a bit biased in his representations of the Indians, and the book does abound with examples of such language, however, the fact that he doesn't really seem to use other characters in a (presumably) self-deprecating dialogue, makes this one quote really stand out from the others for me. The dialogue with the negroes(pip and the cook come to mind) on board does not have the self-deprecating quality that this event does, and nor does the scene with the Parsee stowaway(I can't remember the name).  In the descriptions he wrote regarding the shortcomings of these peoples, but this is the only event in the book where a character condemns his whole race as something undesirable. This is the evasive quality of this line that compels me to believe I am not fully understanding the context.

Edit: typo </TEXT>

<TEXT> The last sentence in chapter 66, The Shark Massacre: "wedder fiji god...one dam Ingin", what does he mean by "Ingin"? I can't figure out for certain what he means and the footnotes look over this word. Indian doesn't quite make sense, Ingenioius wouldn't make sense either and he capitalized it so I assume it's a proper noun. Thanks for your help in advance.

It may do well to expose them and try to rationalize better salaries for teachers. If you're organized and anticipate the tough questions it will likely improve the prospective outcomes on your behalf.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I guess I should have made a note on soil media as most of the orchids I water are in a nursery and have sphagnum moss soil media which will absorb too much water for healthy Phals. Thanks for the advice though, I hadn't heard of watering them in such a way before.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Could be a combination of both factors. Usually I water the Phals 2x weekly with a volume of water roughly equal to an ice cube, although that depends on the conditions the orchid gets, but is nonetheless a general rule of thumb. As long as it's getting enough light, it seems like it's getting over the shock of being moved to a new location. After a month or two it should be fine. </TEXT>

Personally, I would cut an inch above the highest growing branch, remove all but the most vigorous branch, stake the branch to grow upwards and remove any others that grow from the trunk. In a couple years you'll never know, it'll have a thicker base (more value) and it will be tougher for any future misfortune that may occur.  </TEXT>

Some people say talking with them keeps them happy, but all I know is that if we talk now and again I actually feel better, and I like that, even if it's just a few sweet nothings at watering or repotting time. They also appreciate water at regular intervals, sufficient light, rootbound pots and a regular fertilizer schedule.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dear dyson customer service representative, 

I had a most unfortunate encounter with one of your vacuums. While vacuuming some gunpowder after a relaxing Sunday preparing for the apocalypse and prepping bullets, a lit cigarette fell into the path of the vacuum. A substantial explosion ensued, and, unfortunately, in the aftermath, both vacuum and cigarette were unsalvageable. I kindly request you consider replacing both the cigarrette and the vacuum. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Regards,

<TEXT> The Athenians sophists thought that a constitutional monarchy was best. They believed that a democracy would allow for demagogues to manipulate public opinion. That Tyranny would lead to oppression. The Spartans led a life of idealistic socialism, and could afford to do so by subjecting the neighboring city state to slavery to produce their food and goods. The Romans had a system where the wealthy enjoyed a voting system which gave them a greater percentage of the vote than the middle and lower classes(rich got 3/5 voting power and others got less). I don't know what's best though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Short answer: Inflation has occurred in every sector of the U.S. economy except for wages. Wages have experienced inflation, however the rates of inflation for wages are lower than other markets. Healthcare, food, housing and other sectors of the market have had their prices go up significantly more than wages have. I remember seeing a graph  from one of my economics courses but a failed google search for the statistics for 15 minutes just helped me realize that an education actually does have some value.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You realize that you have made an ad hominem attack on a person questioning your credibility, don't you? But you asked for this so lets do it.


There is no mention of Jesus before he was thirty and he lived "the hero motif". That is, he was born under a prophecy, nobody knows what happened until he was 30, he performed all sorts of unearthly miracles, died at the hands of injustice under a great empire and was resurrected among others, which escape my memory as I write this on mobile without my sources. Many other mythological figures lived this motif, Gilgamesh comes to mind, but there are 5 to 6 others in various religions throughout the world as well who lived the motif.


It is notable that a person who lived such a life performing miracles and whatnot was not mentioned by any Roman author during his lifetime in a time kmown for abundant roman authorship. In fact, none mention him until about 4 decades after his death. Ok, nbd, right? 


Well, you'd think so, but scholars know that jews in the region where Jesus came from worshipped as a sect the 'messiah Joshua'. What does Jesus's name translate into from Ancient Greek? It translates to the messiah Joshua. These Jews believed that the messiah Joshua symbolized peace and love for all mankind and that this messiah was the spiritual embodiment thereof. Somehow it seems a leap was fabricated between the metaphysical Messiah Joshua and the flesh and bone Jesus Christ son of god.

So, the one writer who did live and write during Jesus's time was Peter. However, the more one reads peter, the more it becomes obvious that he, in the vast majority of cases, could be speaking of Jesus in a spiritual or metaphysical sense and demonstrably not in the physical sense.

So, now I have the asserted that the messiah joshua was the spiritual embodiment of peace and love for humanity before Jesus and that jews were worshipping the messiah Joshua before the transformation to Jesus Christ as we know him, well, postulated, as I do not have my sources at hand. But I would be more than happy to return  to this when I do if in return you profess your ignorance on the matter of Socrates, which you have so well avoided until now. I will return to this with sources to not only counter your claim that Socrates didn'texist but also to bring to light the significant shortcomings of the Jesus ideology. Frankly, I don't expect you to respond.

<TEXT> Well, part of the justification judges and law enforcement give is that bikes don't have the same capacity to injure as automobiles do. There are injuries from bike related incidents, however I have yet to hear of a bicycle caused fatality. That is not however true for automobiles. Don't get me wrong, I think a lot of cyclists ride recklessly and irresponsibly, but an automobile driving in such a fashion would be much more dangerous.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have got to be kidding me. 

When I was 14, the local cop came by my house every day. Got all up in my business. Didn't ever think about it until I was older, but I was the only black kid in the area and he didn't go to any of the white kids' homes.

I managed a business in the nice part of town and the local cop stared me down for the first two months until he realized I worked there. 

I'm not saying cops are all bad, but unless I absolutely need to, I am not calling them or asking them for their help one little bit. If you ask ppl in the black community, they will say the same thing. The police never make anything better, I stand by that.

<TEXT> That was condescending and I resent it. I may not know all the ins and outs, but I worked in Congress and know better than most. What's going to happen if the alt right takes this as encouragement and acts on it? What happens when its revealed or realized that this terrorism could have been stopped if the president didn't do this? By the foia we are entitled to a lot of info, but thats another story. He is literally putting American lives at risk and some nazi will act on it. What happened to providing for the common defense, general welfare and blessings of liberty? How's that going to work for him? 

Furthermore, just because I sometimes get triggered and don't perceive reality as it exists, doesn't mean that I don't understand, sometimes I just stick my foot in my mouth before I fully understand. But maybe one day you'll have ptsd and understand.

<TEXT> Toucan Sam was so upset when they spelled his name wrong that he surprised everyone with his pent up ferocity and destroyed all his enemies with impunity at the sleight.

<TEXT> I'm sorry but this sort of happy-go-lucky bullshit is just meaningless nonsense. Try living with PTSD and saying it doesn't define you. I tried for years only to listen to self-righteous, clueless people like you tell me I should just get over it, or don't let it define me. It sounds good, sure, but that's all, just another sweet nothing.  </TEXT>

Tbh, I'd be  skeptical if it was at bucks too, but it'd be more likely, I just can't see him using those spaces cuz so many ppl have access and the parking lot would make it difficult to traffic kids stealthily. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was working nearby at a low wage job I had to take to fit my uni schedule. He came in and took a liking to me and offered me a job serving at comet. I declined for months but finally I thought that if the money was better and, since James was so well known and in good standing in the DC area, that he would have good reason not to make me uncomfortable or do anything. I was wrong. Stressed, overworked with school and far from home nearing the end of my 2nd year at Uni, I needed someone to talk to and I went for some drinks with him. That's pretty much how it happened.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some leaked emails indicated that the Podestas used funny language and there's a bunch of loose ends and ambiguous terminology that indicates potential foul play. 


He definitely would have had the resources to pull that kind of thing but I am kind of on the fence as to whether he would do it. I should also note that I think I have some of the symptoms of Stockholm Syndrome.

<TEXT> I worked as an intern for the Architecture and engineering department at uni and was assigned to work on a survey to make sure that the blueprints were accurate for every building. I get through maybe 80 percent of the work and then I have to go to the Army ROTC HQ on campus to do the survey. No big deal, everything in the office was correctly represented on the blueprints, but the guy working the desk told me that there was a hallway behind the office. So he takes me back there and opens the door to a hallway full of dust, cobwebs and high windows on the right that disappear a few feet in as the building is built on a hill. Dutifully, I go forward into the darkness. I can't remember if I didn't have a flashlight or what, but I went in there and all I could think was that I was going to find a body or something. So I just said that the blueprints were right and got the fuck out of there. Definitely something you'd see in a horror movie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Phone died, sorry for slow reply. 

You're right, a thing does not need to benefit society to exist. However, assumptions of capitalism assert that society will benefit in the form of the fruits brought by those who successfully foresee Adam Smith's invisible hand. Additionally, the justice system revolves around this notion of improving society; bring things to the masses cheaper, great, bring things to the masses that was before impossible, also great. Historically also, did Hitler improve society? What about Stalin? Pol pot? They didn't benefit society, but they existed. 


  I believe that this article is scratching the surface of your question: whether executive pay harms society. Do the firms actually impart value to the economy or society at large? Increasingly the answer is no. Did firms harm the economy after the 2008/9 collapse? Well, wall street is doing fine, but not main street so much, and that impairs the long term health of the economy. 

There are, additionally, historic examples. Rome before the empire, and the French monarchy. Rome, with senators who not only received a greater portion of voting power than their poorer countrymen, but also with estates as large as Georgia. There were a few civil wars before Augustus put the empire in power and killed all his opponents impunity. The French aristocracy was so wealthy that one Robespierre in a speech advocated that the French people forcibly take their fortunes. So, yeah,I think it's not good for the economy/society and that this happens naturally in the progress of a nation or state. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although profits have been economically insignificant in many large firms over the last 15 years, corporate executives' pay has still gone up. If a fundamental aspect of our assumptions on capitalism is that the market rewards those who impart an added value to the economy, then current research may make us reconsider how we view the rewards for those who are responsible for the firms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I loved that movie...don't tell anyone, but I cried too. It's very pertinent to our generations. The science was good, if a bit of a stretch at times, although considering our place in the advances in science, I thought it wasn't over the top. The scenes of familial love really hit me hard. Much of my family is like Coop's, rural, grandparents were around, in fact an uncle of mine is quite similar to coop. Just an all around great movie that calls to the conscience of our generations.

<TEXT> I looked it up. That was written about 100 years after Jesus' was said to have died. There is simply not enough primary evidence to support the conclusion that Jesus Christ was ever a true flesh and bone person. Additionally, Jesus Christ translates from the Greek into the Messiah Joshua and Jews in that region were worshippers of Joshua, who was a figurative representation of peace and love for all mankind. The fact that the first surviving historical literature on Jesus was 40 years after his death is significant as the period of Jesus' supposed life was a period in which a significant amount of Roman Historical authorship was being written. It is peculiar that a man who had done so many miracles and who had caused such turmoil was not even noted in his time of such prevalent Roman historical authorship. Furthermore, all supposed physical artifacts are spurious at best, their finders, and Christians everywhere, are remarkably unscientific in their attribution of authenticity these artifacts. It simply just doesn't add up to a flesh and bone son of god or man to me. Even my professor, with a PHD in classics from Harvard, admitted that the evidence was insufficient to support a definite conclusion for his existence, and that one had to make a leap of faith to believe in the flesh and blood Jesus. Personally, I believe the idea of a flesh and blood Jesus is no different than believing the earth is flat or that it's the center of the universe, the evidence just isn't there. 

Edit 1: typo

Edit 2. It is also interesting to note that so many aspects of jesus fit the "hero motif," Wherein some son of god, or son of man turns into god, is born miraculously, disappears until about 30, performs some miracles, dies under an authoritarian hand, and is resurrected, and some others I can't recall or find on a brief google search. This is shared by Gilgamesh, and about 5 to 10 other myths. 

Edit 3: instead of downvoting, I challenge any of you to disprove what I have written above.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, as a person who repots orchids often, I would just wait until the flowers are spent and in the meantime focus on making sure you dont overwater and that it's not overwatered now. I write that because it seems a little on the wet side in the pics. The moss that wholesale nurseries use is not the ideal medium for phals, it soaks up and retains a significant amount of water and should never be saturated for orchids(for phals, the orchid bark almost cant be overwatered, given that it's not watered too often). If the moss is saturated, I recommend repotting into orchid bark within the next two to three days(get the fine bark, coarse and medium are difficult to work into the roots). </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU by not reading the ingredients in Neosporin to see if I'm allergic. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-13 19:29:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So about three months ago I had to walk through some rain for a couple hours and then wear wet shoes all day. I had a tiny little scratch that was healing on the top of my foot and after having had wet feet all day, it became somewhat worse. So I went to my local CVS and bought some Neosporin. And, while I'm looking at the types of Neosporin, I notice the triple antibiotic neosporin and think: "Hey, this stuff has got to a little better and worth the marginally larger price," so I buy the triple antibiotic, take it home and start using it. A week goes by and it's gotten worse yet. I contribute this to the fact that it is on an area of my foot that rubs the shoe a lot, and just keep using the antibiotic every other day. A couple days later, I cut my arm and used the triple antibiotic, but this time, the entire band aid left a little rash. So now I think that the adhesive in the band aids were making my foot's sores worse and I switch to medical tape and gauze and continue using the fancy Neosporin. Then, as it continues to worsen, I realize that I'm still allergic to something and that it wasn't the band aids or any of the other factors. So, I read the ingredients on the Neosporin and sure enough, I'm allergic to 2/3 of the active ingredients in the Neosporin; the sulfate drugs. 5 seconds of critical thought could have saved me months of discomfort. So, now I've had a healing wound on my foot for months and feel like a complete idiot for assuming that triple antibiotic neosporin is just as good for me than the original stuff without thinking I might be allergic to any of the ingredients. So take a moment and read the ingredients to make sure you're not allergic to the ingredients. 


Tl;dr:Read the ingredients when buying over the counter medications, it can save you months of discomfort. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Monsanto. Pick a reason, any reason. 


Edit: this is a little more controversial than I expected. The reasons i had in mind were the lawsuits against honest farmers whose crops had been pollinated by neighbors' Monsanto patented  crops. I'm not really against GM crops, but the way Monsanto covers up its products says foul play to me. Its good that they've provided more high yield crops, but they didn't have to do it by stepping on honest farmers and thumbing their nose over their prowess over the law at everybody.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's called rally racing. I'd love to see some drift racer even just try that. Why? Because the drivers don't know the roads. They have a navigator giving out directions while they drive like madmen on all  road surfaces, ice, snow, gravel, dust, tarmac, and while they race against the clock without knowing how they compare to the other drivers' times on race segments. Best auto racing on the planet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You'll benefit from high spoke count and durable rims(also keep an eye on the tire pressure, too low will cause pinching flats). Mavic and dt swiss come to mind, but there are many suitable rims on the market. Keep in mind that many road frames are designed for "normal" road riding(think endurance, rather than technical skill ), so a race frame might not be so well suited to stairs, etc as a touring or cyclocross frame. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe the word you're looking for is transpiration, evapotranspiration would indicate the entire environment, possibly in this case local environment, whereas transpiration refers solely to the process of plants evaporating water through leaves, which seems to be what you meant, as evaporation indicates cooling.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm selling my Bianchi Boron

Handmade in Italy with Boron Steel

Campagnolo Record 9 speed carbon ergopower levers(like new less than 400 miles not a mark, 2004 model, installed 2 months ago, still have the box)

White industries hubs laced to pacenti sl23 rims, super smooth(will come with spare front wheel)

Phil wood titanium Bottom Bracket

Campagnolo Daytona derailleur

Campy Athena Brakes, Koolstop pads

Brooks B17 black saddle, 700 or so miles, getting well broken in

Specialized short and shallow handlebars

Ritchey Carbon Matrix Stem

Brooks leather bar tape, teal

Specialized carbon seatpost

Michelin Pro 4 tires, plenty of life, rear has less than 200 miles

This is a super fast and rare early 2000 model Bianchi. Very light and fast, climbs excellently, handles very well, keeps up and passes carbon no problem. Gets looks all the time. Shifts so smooth that oftentimes you don't even realize it shifted. 3x9 setup12-25 or thereabouts, I think. I am the third owner. The second owner was a woman who owned it briefly, the first owner was a man who had it stored in his garage after riding it apparently only briefly. There is no rust and the bike, despite the patina is in excellent structural and mechanical condition.

The pictures are before the campy makeover, has one more bottle holder. will come with that front wheel as well as the pacenti/white industries.



It's a bit small for me and I need the dough. She'd fit up to about 5'7 I reckon. Cash only, local. Email me any questions.

<TITLE> Removing rust and preserving the frame of a fancy ass 2001 bianchi boron </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-19 01:32:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I bought one of my dream bikes, a Bianchi boron XL(2001). I have sublime dreams of putting lovely Campagnolo parts all over it albeit tempered by the sobering reality of expensive Italian components and my finite purchasing ability. Although luckily I have 60 percent of the group parts and the ultegra components on it are in really good shape.


So, I pulled out the seat post and it has a little rust in there. It's presumably been in storage just inland from the coast in northern California for a few years(moist air) and I got it from a guy who bought it at an estate sale. So, obviously, I've gotta stop the rust and prevent any more from happening, but it has a sticker note saying that chemicals should be avoided when washing because it has structural foam. So I guess I'll just wash it with mild dish soap, that's whatever, but what does that mean for the rust. I read somewhere that they used structural foam similar to stuff they used in high end automobiles but I'm not sure if that really helps.


So what would you guys do about this? How would you clean out the rust and prevent any more from occurring? I'd really appreciate any advice you can give. Thanks in advance!



Tl;dr: bought a bike with a structural-foam reinforced steel frame that has the beginning signs of rust and I want advice on rust removal and prevention </TEXT>
