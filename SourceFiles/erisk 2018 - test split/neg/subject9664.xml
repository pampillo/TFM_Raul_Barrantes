<TEXT> I have only filmed 3 weddings (I mainly do corporate videos), but for one of them what I did was set up a little booth for people to record video messages. Some of these were hilarious. Later in the day when people have had a couple of drinks people loosened up and gave some really funny messages. It helped when they give messages in groups and have a bit of an audience to egg them on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have found that a lot of the ones I take short cuts with and don't bother making stories for I end up having to relearn and don't stick with me very well. I did a test once where I tried to learn 20 new words using mnemonics and 20 without. I remembered way way more of the mnemonic ones. In that sense spending a minute to make a word stick is much more time efficient. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree about not being an elitist, but I don't see why having a wide taste would be linked to maturity. Some people are just into particular types of music. For example, if Jazz music is your thing and you don't have that same passion for other genres, I would struggle to call that immature taste. You just have a genre that speaks to you more than others do.

On the flip side, I would suggest that understanding that all taste is inherently subjective, and not objective, is a more mature approach.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find so much great stuff on VideoHive, things like templates, icons, effects etc. I use these for commercial work and I charge the cost of the license as an expense to the customer.

However, I really want to make a youtube channel that utilises some of these materials on a weekly basis. Where is a good place to find these kinds of materials for a one off payment for unlimited use, or even an annual subscription. I am willing to pay for the material, however as the youtube channel will be completely not for profit, I can't afford to shell out for licenses every video.

If anyone has any tips or links that could help me, that would be great. Thanks for your help. </TEXT>

I love asian food and when I go there I want to try all the food the way they locals eat it. Luckily with almost all asia food I don't need to worry about cheese at all.

<TEXT> I love food and I love cooking. I consider myself to be fairly open minded with food and I love trying new food, especially different cuisines when travelling. However I find it very frustrating when there is food that I "don't like".

For me cheese is the worst one. It's annoying because it's in so many different dishes, and everyone seems to love it except for me. 

When I was a kid I wouldn't eat any cheese at all. Now I can eat mozzarella and Halloumi, which are probably the least cheesy cheeses. I can't even eat a bit of mild cheddar. 

I don't expect to be eating strong blue cheeses anytime soon, but is there a way to train yourself to some extent to enjoy a food that you previously didn't like? Or do I have to just accept that I'll never enjoy cheese? </TEXT>

It depends what you mean by "unable to function mentally". Most humans who are mentally handicapped in some way are still fully conscious, still feel emotion the same way as everyone else, still are self aware in a way that most animals aren't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Animals are Living and thus Innately valuable"

Plants are also living. So are bacteria. 

I think a better system is to not act like all living things are equal, but to examine to what kind of rights are deserving of what kind of animals. 

I believe that Humans deserve more rights than animals because we have a much higher level of understanding and awareness, and higher capacity for emotional suffering. 

In the same way, I believe that Chimpanzees also deserve a fair amount of rights because they are very intelligent, social creatures, that have emotions. I think most people would agree that it is not ethical to farm chimpanzees for this reason.

Chickens also deserve rights, of course, they should not have to suffer severe pain and stress, but they essentially do not have the same level of understanding, emotion and intelligence than humans or chimpanzees.

Ants have no real emotional capacity and we therefore do not lose much sleep if we accidentally step on one.

Animals can be placed on a scale from the most intelligent and emotional at the top to the least at the bottom. Doesn't it make more sense to give rights based on where an animal falls on this scale rather than equal rights to all? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think that link really says that breasts are not biologically sexual, or that it's entirely a modern western thing.

I agree that there are many cultures that have no problem with bare breasts. There are also come cultures that are fine with complete nudity, it doesn't mean that genitals are not sexual in their culture.

The sexualisation of breasts varies from place to place, as it is a mixture of culture and biology. In the modern west breasts are probably more sexualised than anywhere else. That is our culture, I agree.

So what point are you making, that we should break down the "cultural" side, and ignore the biological side. Why try and change such a prevalent cultural feeling for such a relatively minor gain. There are also positive aspects to the sexualisation of breasts remember.

Also, an interesting read: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201305/sexual-wiring-womens-breasts </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand that breasts aren't genitals, but they are sexual organs, and not just because some men ages ago decided that we can shame women with them. Men's chests are not sexual organs in the same way, and not just because we're used to seeing them more.

Women's bodies are different from men's bodies. Is it double standards that women don't have urinals in their bathrooms? No, because they have different bodies. I understand that people want to argue that women's breasts aren't sexual organs, but I assure you that men don't feel the way they do about them just because they're not used to seeing them.

Edit: Also I want to state that I'm not arguing for or against a woman's right to go topless in public. I just think there is no hypocrisy or double standards at play. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so you're saying that if hygiene wasn't an issue, then public nudity of ALL kinds should be absolutely fine. That's a perfectly fine stance to have, but it's one I think you have to accept. Although it may be your argument against public nudity, there any many people who consider it inappropriate for reasons aside from hygiene. 

The reason I'm pressing this point is that you seem to imply that people single out female breasts, when they don't, because they feel the same about genitals of both genders, and not for hygiene reasons. My point is, there is no hypocrisy or double standards at play. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've sidestepped the argument by bringing in hygiene. There are many situations where hygiene isn't really an issue, for example, the beach.

Your second argument can also be applied to full nudity. I don't think you have a serious argument unless you can address this issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you think that people, both men and women, should be allowed to go fully nude in public? If not, then why not? It seems like you have selected toplessness because you see it as "unfair" that men get to go topless and women don't. The thing is, female breasts are much more of a sexual organ than the male chest. That's probably a mix of culture and biology, but that's not changing any time soon. 

Even if you changed the laws (I don't know what they are) about women going topless in public, how do you expect to change how men "feel" about breasts. What point are you actually arguing? Are you just stating that it's not fair? Because it's also not fair that women have to deal with periods every month, or experience pain in childbirth. These things aren't decided by men, they're the way things are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly, do you not think it's a good thing to try to speak out against the injustices in the world, to help change the world for the better, however slight that change may be in the grand scheme of things. For example, should gay people have not said anything about the prejudice that they faced? Change doesn't happen if nobody vocalises the problems and injustices. That goes from important things like racial prejudice, to more insignificant things like a workplace environment being demotivating.

Secondly, people are people, they need to express how they feel. Everyone has problems. It gets you through life to share them. I'll share with friends or a partner problems as big as someone i care about dying to as small as missing a train, and they will to me in return. It helps us through life. It doesn't mean that we don't realise that many people have it much worse off than us. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   I believe that anything that you hide from your partner where they would not consent to sex with you if they were informed of it is considered Rape by Deception.

This is a problem, because you don't know what every person's boundaries are. Some people wouldn't sleep with someone if they'd slept over a certain number of people. It's not rape to not disclose that information beforehand. So what's the difference? 

You can say that there are many people would be MORE upset by finding out a partner's birth gender is different than they thought. That still doesn't make it rape, whether it's ethical or not.

You haven't provided a reason why birth gender is somehow different to religion, race, number of partners, sexuality, favourite football team, etc etc. </TEXT>

I accept that you can define God in the way that are you (albeit unhelpfully), but you can't use that to make any logical claims about religion or belief systems. 

I'm not just disputing your premise, I'm also disputing your conclusion. If God is all, I believe that many belief systems are not true. You say that if God is all, then the bible is the word of God. Which definition of God are you using, your definition or the Bible's very different definition. The Bible claims it is the word of the Christian God. It doesn't claim it's the word of your God definition.  </TEXT>

You are talking to other people and I have no idea what you are talking about because you are taking a word and using it in a way that doesn't make sense.

So let's call it "goopurt".

The major world religions don't really have anything to say about goopurt, they make claims about various Gods. When they make claims that are true, that is goopurt, as goopurt is everything. If they make claims that are false, for example about the nature of God, that is goopurt too. Because goopurt is everything. Just because something is goopurt doesn't make it true. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You seem stuck on the point that being black makes you "more likely to be prone to crime".

I want to take the analogy that  /u/wonkay gave and explore it.

Imagine that 70% of American boys had their legs operated (for whatever reason) on to make them significantly weaker at running fast. 

Now the statistics will say that American men are bad at running. 

Now do you think it's reasonable to say to an American man who has not had that operation as a child, that he is more likely to be bad at running because he is an American man.

If he explains to you that he hasn't had the operation as a child and that he is a very fast runner, will you tell him that the statistics don't lie and the "reasons" behind them don't matter?

The reason why racism is bad is that we should judge people as individuals, not based on statistics.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly, I don't think you've made any argument as to why future art will not be as good as last art. We've had thousands of years of art. You've picked a couple of important artists and claimed that nothing will top it. Why won't they? In the hundreds or thousands of years to come, why is it unlikely for someone to make art as great as the last greats.

Secondly, art isn't just some old relic to be judged by its historical impact. Art is about communicating ideas, creating passion and excitement amongst people, creating something that people relate to, something relevant to the audience of today. 

Nothing against the Mona Lisa but I'm more excited to hear the new Radiohead album. </TEXT>

Also if you are concerned about how people will view you, as time goes on, more and more people are viewing the non-support of gay people to be unacceptable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Success in terms of career and money doesn't equal happiness. I know many people don't believe that, but it really is only part of the equation. 

Lack of empathy may well lead you to faster financial or career success in many situations, but that is not really what you are after. What you really want is happiness. 

I think people that care about other people and have people care about them are the happiest people. There are plenty of "successful" people that are not happy. 

While success and empathy both contribute to a person's happiness, I think that empathy has a bigger impact. The joys of material possessions wear off, regardless how much you have. What's the point of having success if you lack the empathy to enjoy it and share it with others. </TEXT>

Good point about potentially taking away work from the website side of things.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a freelance videographer (Surrey, UK), who wants to build some relationships with local web designers and developers in the New Year. I would really appreciate it if anyone could give me some advice regarding my plan.

What I want to do is have web developers offer their clients video services, and then refer them to me to do the work. My rate would be around 450 depending on the project. The web developer could mark up the price to what they feel is appropriate, say 600. They can be as involved or not involved as they like in the process.

I get more business my way, the web developer gets money for very little extra work, the client gets a service they need. No one stands to lose very much from the deal. 

From a web developer perspective, what are the pros and cons of the deal for you? Do you think it is a deal that many people would go for? What would be the best way to approach them? I am not naturally a great business thinker, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks </TEXT>

If you enjoy food a lot, (I do), then eating at a restaurant is an opportunity to eat food that you cannot cook yourself, due to insufficient skill, patience or equipment, and socialise whilst doing it.

Also when you cook yourself, it is easy to get into habits of using the same techniques and ingredients. Eating out offers inspiration and variety.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say that how hard working you are refers to your natural and acquired potential and how hard you work is what you actually do with it. 

Unless your view is all pride is pointless regardless of everything. You can say that there's no free will, life is deterministic and we're just a bunch of atoms bouncing around, but what's the point? Why would you  want to deny yourself and others a positive emotion that you have earned through hard work. Regardless of circumstances and genes, hard work is still hard. Reward yourself with pride over your successes and use that list for pride to help you succeed in life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's take the best athletes in the world in their respective fields as an example. They are superior partly because of their genes, partly because of the circumstances of their birth and upbringing, and **partly because of all the hard work they have put in**. I don't think there are many (any?) athletes who have reached the top without extreme amounts of hard work and self discipline.

<TEXT> Well I agree the method of HOW you avoid spoilers is up for debate. Endless hoops to jump through and tags and rules are frustrating for most people I would think. Those are two different questions, should we respect spoilers and how should we do it. The more hassle free the system is the better I think. It just needs to be one word, it takes 1 second.

As for proving that it's worth it, I mean, what do you want? Obviously I can't prove it I can only reason with you. The excitement that I got from watching breaking bad unspoilt was extremely intense for me and many other people. I enjoyed that show so much and I would have genuinely been very unset if certain plot points had been spoilt. There is a middle ground to be had here. If you put the word *spoilers* on a thread that you start, I won't click on it. If I go in and have it spoilt, then that's on me. However it is reasonable to not expect to see unwarned spoilers on my Facebook feed for example.

Im willing to do what is necessary to avoid spoilers that I care about, but I should not have to have them thrust upon me with no warning at all. </TEXT>

I really really hate it when people don't respect that people don't want to have things spoilt. I much prefer watching something when I don't know what is going to happen. 

The pleasure that people get from watching a show or film unspoilt far far outweighs the one second it takes to write *spoilers*.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'm a very quiet person, but I only find silences awkward when I can tell the other person is uncomfortable with the silence. What I would suggest is when there is a silence in a conversation, make a judgement as to whether the other person seems uncomfortable. If they do, then I think it will probably always be a bit awkward, but if they don't, then there is no reason for you to feel awkward or uncomfortable. If you practise not worrying about filling every silence then they will probably become more comfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In theory the directors cut is a version of the film approved by the director which may be closer to their own vision. They're often longer than the theatrical cut, however they're not always better. Also, sometimes it's just a marketing tool. There is a director's cut of Alien, however Ridley Scott has said that the original theatrical cut is the "real" directors cut, and the one he prefers.

Personally I watch the theatrical cut of a film, unless I have it on good authority that a different version is notably superior. </TEXT>

It is impossible to live life "perfectly" in terms of health. However if you live a very unhealthy first half, you are more likely to have a much more difficult second half.

<TEXT> I'm going to China for the first time with my girlfriend next year. We have changed our itinerary around a lot and this is the plan we have currently:

Shanghai - March 24th
Zhangjiajie - March 28th
Fenghuang - March 31st
Guilin - April 3rd
Guangzhou - April 6th

Does this seem realistic for the timespan?

Guilin looks beautiful in the photos I've seen, but I read that it will be very rainy in April. Has anyone been there around that time of year? We can obviously deal with some rain, I just wondered if there was any reason that it might negatively impact the visit (visibility, mobility etc).

Is it generally quite easy to hire private cars from hotels in China? What sort of prices might they be? We would like to make a day trip to Qianyang from Fenghuang which would be about 2 hours drive each way. Is it realistic to do this in a private car?

Is there any general advice or comments that might help us with our trip regarding our first time to China and our itinerary. Any help would be really appreciated. </TEXT>

Boredom might be the default option if you sit alone in a room all day, but that's why people don't sit alone in a room all day. People have jobs and friends and hobbies, that provide constant stimulus. Having to put effort into life to get something back out isn't inherantly a bad thing as you seem to imply. You describe it like it's all a big chore to avoid boredom. That is a mindset that you have chosen to indulge in and not one that is shared by everyone. Life can be very difficult and not everyone has the same opportunities for happiness, but most people can work towards happiness in their life. I am very with my job, relationships, hobbies, and having worked for them makes them more satisfying, not a chore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your argument seems to rely quite heavily on the idea that film can look more realistic than theatre and therefore it is easier for the audience to suspend their disbelief. I disagree that it is easier to suspend disbelief in film, and even if it is, I disagree that makes it superior to theatre.

When films are going for realism, it can be more distracting when something breaks that. For example there is a film called "let the right one in", (one of my favourite films) which is very naturalistically acted and shot, despite being about vampires, but I am always very distracted by a scene where the filmmakers have used CGI on the faces of some cats. Although as film further matures and technology improves, this issue may decrease, I still believe that the more realistic something tries to be, the easier it is for that realism to be broken.

With theatre, I am not distracted by those things as much, as i don't expect to see real blood, or real talking animals etc.

When I went to see the lion king musical (a long time ago now, forgive me if I forget the details), I remember being overwhelmed by the appearance of certain animals. The way the elephants were constructed and the way they moved. I was overwhelmed by the sheer artistry, creativity and beauty of it. It didn't look anything like a real elephant, nor did it need to, I never doubted it was an elephant. I realise that this is probably not the sort of theatre you had in mind with your argument but Ijust use it to illustrate my point. The argument also extends to non musical theatre.

Is photography a better medium than painting because it's more realistic? Theatre is more than just conveying a story, you can bask in the live spectacle of it. The creativity of it. The joy of seeing a one off performance that is just for you that night, that will never be repeated identically again. Seeing an actor give a emotive uninterrupted performance. These are things that can make theatre special.

I don't believe either medium is 'better'. They both have their own joys. It comes down to taste which one you enjoy more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Taking a more general look at it, I do not believe it is hypocritical at all to criticise someone else's meat choice when you yourself eat meat. For example, I would be critical of a person or culture that farmed and ate Chimpanzees, but not chickens. This is because I believe that a chimpanzee has a higher level of self awareness and higher capacity for emotional distress than that of a chicken. For this reason, I do not believe that "meat is meat". 

Similar arguments could be made for dogs (although I do not personally have an opinion on it). Regardless of where you draw the line at meat eating (and I think most of us do draw a line somewhere), I don't think it's hypocritical to do so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The English language is such a tangled mess of inconsistencies, irregularities, weird pronunciations, and other baffling features. It has been argued that you could spell the word "fish" as "ghoti".

"gh", pronounced [f] as in tough [tf];

"o", pronounced [] as in women [wmn]; and

"ti", pronounced [] as in nation [nen].

You can try and go through and sort out all these quirks, but doing so would create a drastically different language. There is no governing body over the English language. Language evolves naturally. Attempts to artificially dictate how people *should* use the language are generally ignored.

The English language as we know it, with its "C"s, "X"s and "Q"s won't disappear. I'm not going to start changing how I go about spelling words at this point in my life. At most you would create an alternative version of the language. If anything this will make learning the language more confusing, as you will have to learn two versions of the language. Consider how much existing material is already written in English with the letters that you wish to remove.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that would a pretty common response and one that I agree with, but I don't understand specifically what you mean by "there should be no sympathy". Especially when everyone takes those risks in their life. This hypothetical person just had bad luck with this specific risk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But you said "there should be no sympathy for them". What does that mean? If I hear that one of my friends died in a diving accident, what do you think I should feel about that? Should I just think, "well a good person died doing what he loved, but it doesn't matter because he knew there was a slight risk involved so it's his own fault". It's a very strange way to view the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Life is never without risk. You take risks when you drive a car, drink alcohol, cross a road, go on holiday, climb a mountain, swim with sharks, eat unhealthy food. Everyone individually decides what risks are worth taking in their own lives and which ones are not. If you are not passionate about mountain climbing, then it's not a risk worth taking for you. I enjoy SCUBA diving occasionally. I am aware that there is risk of death. I do it responsibly and as safely as I can. 

You can reduce the risk in your life massively by staying in your house, only eating healthy food, never making unnecessary journeys, never leaving your comfort zone. But I would say this runs a bigger risk, the risk of wasting your life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What does it mean to favor men in the example of a job that needs strength. That a woman needs to perform to a higher standard than a man? Hiring more men than women in a manual job that requires a lot of strength isn't discrimination, because it is likely that more men are capable for the job, more men want the job and more men apply for the job. However, why would you discriminate in favour of men? Why shouldn't a woman be able to compete for a job by the same set of standards that a man is held? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should not discriminate based on gender or colour.
 "if it's a strength based job favor the man for the job", no, favour the person who is better for the job, regardless of gender. There are plenty of women who are stronger and fitter than men. This is exactly why you should NOT discriminate. You could employ an inferior male worker instead of a superior female one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you, but on the other hand, if the building was designed with a higher resale value in mind, it probably would have got fewer upvotes on reddit. The point was clearly to attract attention and turn heads, not guarantee a safe resell. I understand there are risks with that, but as someone looking at a picture on the Internet, I don't care about those.

I hope I don't sound aggressive, I respect your opinion, and as I said, I don't know the first thing about architecture other than what is pleasing to my eye. It's just that when I saw the picture it was exciting to see a building so different and made me want to see it in real life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that some of your points are valid, but "no subjectivity about it" seems silly to me when you're discussing whether anything is good or bad.

Presumably resale value wasn't a priority when you design a building like this. That's like saying a film isn't good because it won't sell to a big audience. What would happen if everyone made their house in the shape of their favourite thing is irrelevant because they don't. 

Again I'm not saying that your points are not valid, but I am saying it's subjective. I don't think something can fairly be judged by rules that it is breaking intentionally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our basic instincts are set up by an evolutionary drive to survive and reproduce, however in many ways we have taken control of those instincts and we make life our own. For example, the goal of sex is reproduction, that is why it exists. However we have now invented contraception. We use sex to express love, to relieve stress, to have fun. It has nothing to do with its goal of reproduction if we are using contraception, although the goal of reproduction is what shaped our desires at a base level.

With art, maybe at a base level it might have been to demonstrate to potential mates intelligence or creativity, but now many people create art for the sheer love of it.

I am undecided as to whether I want children in the future, but as of right now, I don't want children. It doesn't mean my life has any less meaning. I have been shaped by my genes to survive and reproduce, but I have a mind advanced enough to take control of my life and make my own decisions.

<TITLE> Are there opportunities to freelance (photography/videography) while teaching English in HCMC? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-27 11:48:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My girlfriend is looking into teaching English in Vietnam for a year or so. She wants me to go with her, and I very much want to. We've been to Vietnam twice and we absolutely love it. The thought of getting our TEFL qualifications and teaching out there for an extended period of time sounds so much fun (and also challenging).

Here in the UK I am trying to establish myself as a freelance videographer, doing weddings, corporate/business videos and music videos.

I am worried that moving to Vietnam would completely halt my progress of this. 

What I was wondering was, are there opportunities to find work as a freelance videographer/photographer in somewhere like Ho Chi Minh City. I would price myself competitively and just use the money to supplement my teaching wage. 

In an ideal world I would spend half of my time teaching English, and half shooting videos or photos for companies (and/or weddings). Is a pipe dream with no root in reality, or is this something that is possible? I have heard that there are many start ups in HCMC, which is why I thought it might not be entirely outside the realms of possibility. I would not be looking for big money from the video work, just to continue working and developing in the field.

Any advice or information relating to my situation would be very greatly appreciated. Thanks. </TEXT>

If a prisoner wants to be be in prison, he isn't free because he doesn't have the CHOICE to leave.
