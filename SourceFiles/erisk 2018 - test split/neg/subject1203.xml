<TITLE> How to upload an apk to Android Emulator? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-12 18:45:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,
I am a UI designer and want to see how an android app looks and feels on the different screen sizes within android.
I have downloaded the android emulator and have created a couple of virtual devices for testing.  My developer sent me the apk via G-drive and I have a difficult time figuring out how I can open this app on the emulator (Android Studio). I have read that I can just drop it, but it does not seeem to work as probably I am doing it all wrong. 
From any android phone I can just open and install the apk on my test phones but the emulator gives me problems.
I would appreciate any help. Thanks! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I wonder if it is only me who would like to know what diet and exercise has worked for people who are in the same shoes like me. Like people who are the same age as me, who make the same money as me, who have the same amount of free time as me, who weigh the same, who have a sedentary life like me, and so on. I am sure there are people out there who go through the same obstacles and would love to somehow connect with them and form groups to make it more motivational for all of us.
What would be the advantages and disadvantages of such groups? </TEXT>

The timer is basically an integral part of the app. 
When a friend requests you to "synco" you get 5 minutes to respond with a picture and a short caption with what you are doing at the moment.

<TEXT> Interesting. and agreed. As much as we would like social apps to connect us, for many of us it just creates an illusion of connectedness, a sort of fake "real" social network.
Not only does most of these apps dosconnect us from each other but it does even create depression.
Just google Facebook Depression.
This is the exact reasons why we wanted to create an app that genuinely conncets us and our friends and family and does it absolutely fast and does not take away time from the real life connections.
Let me know if interested so I give you a link to our app. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for commenting. 
It is true what you are saying about honesty. Some want to be dishonest or just show the best parts of their lives.
Unfortunetly, several studies show that showing off on social media negatively affects most of us. We tend to compare our boring life moments with the highlight reels posted by others. 
Thank you for your idea by the way! :)

<TEXT> Hi guys, we have developed a little app that we believe help people connect with each other online in a more honest way. With this app basically you can get your friends to take a picture at the same time and capture in a photo collage what all you did at this particular moment in time. The reason why we think our app provides a more honest way to connect is that here you have to post life updates and photos not when you want it but when your friends request it. We are brainstorming ideas how to best promote this app and we thought we ask the reddit community for ideas. We appreciate any ideas you might have. Cheers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey Guys,
We have developed a social app that gets you and your friends to take a picture or selfie at the exact same time and makes a photo collage from this shared moment. 
Maybe nonoe of you affected by this, but many studies found a strong correlation between social media usage and depression. This phenomenon happens when people compare their mundane life moments with the highlight reels posted by others on social media. 
When we developed Go Synco we wanted to create a way where users have to post genuine posts and photos about themsleves and mundane moments from their days.
Maybe our app is not the perfect solution but we feel it is a good step in teh right direction.
Basically, Go Synco is a group based social app where any group member can initiate a synco which means that he/she can request everybody in the group to take a photo and add a short caption about what they are doing now.
Everyone in the group gets 5 minutes to respond and when the time is up, all of the group members receive a photo collage stamped with the current time and date to remember when this moment happened.
Now, even though the app is in the stores, both App Store and Google Play, we have a long way to go to say it is finished.
We are currently working on the UX/UI of the app to make it look less like an MVP and more like a real app.
Please download the app and give us some feedback what you like and what you don't, what features would be cool to add and what is waste.
We appreciate all you guys' feedback.
Here you can find the app:
**[Go Synco on App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go-synco/id1075937699?mt=8)**
**[Go Synco on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gosynco hl=en)**
Thanks again! 
Cheers
Peter

<TEXT> Hi Redditors!
My name is Peter Mayer and with my friend we finally managed to push our app to the Google Play.
We know it looks more like an MVP at the moment and we actually started to work on bringing its UX/UI to the 21st century and make it look like and work like a modern app.
We need your feedback and suggestions though what are the things/features/design elements you would add or take away and in general what is your point of view so we can consider it in the UX and/or UI.

Some words about our app:
With Go Synco you can capture what you and your friends do right at this very moment and save the collage of this shared moment as a fun, time stamped memory.
The way this app works is whenever you wonder what your freinds are up to at any moment, you initiate a synco which sends out a notification to all your group members and gives them 5 minutes to take a selfie or photo and add a short caption what they are doing. 

As a sidenote, the reason we started to work on this concept was that we were tired of how current social media and their algoritms promote narcissism and fake online popularity that makes many people feel bad. (you can just google facebook depression).

Thank You for your kind feedback.

More details: We have developed the app and it is available for both **[ios](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go-synco/id1075937699?mt=8)** and **[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gosynco hl=en)**. We are working on changing the UI/UX to make it look like a non-MVP. :)

<TEXT> Thank you. 
We just checked it and it works on our side. Sorry to bother you about this again, but just to clarify, did this happen when you actually filled out your info at the sign up page and you click on signup or it was before that when you download the app and you can either login or signup?
Did you by the way get any error message? 
thanks a lot!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good concept.
One thing I would do right away is to put in plain English on the front page about what happens with the photos after user uploads them and who owns the photos' copyright.
Something like:
"Your photos are in a safe place with us..."

I know it seems like a lot of specifications but let's say if I got lucky and found a few people, and let's say we created a sort of weight loss challenge, don't you think it could be easier to lose weight, to get motivated, because we could all see what each others are doing and we could see what works and what not and we could copy each other's' techniques, recipes and exercises. I feel like this way I would find less excuses for myself and knew that since everybody is in a similar life situation and have similar genetics and backgrounds, I could find less excuses. What do you think? </TEXT>
