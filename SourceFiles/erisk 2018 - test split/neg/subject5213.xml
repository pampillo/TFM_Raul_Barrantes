<TEXT> Recipe can be found [here](http://www.food.com/recipe/greek-potatoes-oven-roasted-and-delicious-87782). 

The recipe is called "Greek potatoes".  Whether or not they are authentic I have no idea.  But I can say they're delicious and we ate the entire dish clean. 

They're crispy, soft on the inside.  With light notes of garlic and lemon.  I don't love oregano but it was perfect here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you!  Here's the recipe:

Sorry it's late:

Beans 

2 cups dried pinto beans
2 cloves garlic
1/2 tsp onion powder
2 TB chicken bullion 

1.  Soak beans in a large bowl over night or 8 hours.  Add plenty of water because the beans expand a little.  

2.  Drain water and rinse beans.  

3.  In a large stockpot add remaining ingredients with about 2 quarts of water.  

4.  Simmer for around 4-5 hours until beans are tender.  Add water throughout if it gets too dry.  

5.  Mash beans to the right consistency you want.  I use an immersion blender and it works perfectly.  Season with salt to taste.

<TEXT> Cajun chicken pasta just sounds better than Pasta with Chicken and Cajun Seasoning.  Was probably named that as a description to what's in the dish as opposed to deeming it an authentic creation.

Don't take it personally.  The word Cajun is used much like "Buffalo".  Anything with buffalo wing sauce and chicken is now a Buffalo Chicken pizza, or Buffalo dip.  Does not mean it's authentic to anything from Buffalo, NY (where Buffalo wings were invented).  "Cajun" in most cases is used as a descriptor of the flavor profile.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been a home cook for awhile and rice has been the HARDEST thing to "get right".  

EDIT:  Sorry it took so long.  I'll add the recipe for my beans too.  

RICE

3 TB vegetable oil
1 cup long-grain rice (jasmine works well too)
2 TB tomato bullion
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 cup mixed frozen vegetables (frozencanned)

1.  On medium heat, fry rice in oil for several minutes.  Use a nonstick skillet.  Stir constantly, do not let it sit idle.  Each grain will turn opaque and white.  

2.  Just before the rice starts to get slightly browned, add water (about 2 cups) with tomato bullion and onion powder.  

3.  Cover with lid and simmer on low heat.  Do not lift lid.  

4.  Once rice has absorbed all water, add frozen vegetables and mix.  

5.  At this point you have to go by the "feel" of it.  If it isn't cooked all the way (mine never is), I add a bit more water, mix it, and then keep the heat on low for 3-7 minutes and turn off heat.  Do not lift lid.  Steaming it with the lid on will make the rice fluffy.



BEANS

2 cups dried pinto beans
2 cloves garlic
1/2 tsp onion powder
2 TB chicken bullion 

1.  Soak beans in a large bowl over night or 8 hours.  Add plenty of water because the beans expand a little.  

2.  Drain water and rinse beans.  

3.  In a large stockpot add remaining ingredients with about 2 quarts of water.  

4.  Simmer for around 4-5 hours until beans are tender.  Add water throughout if it gets too dry.  

5.  Mash beans to the right consistency you want.  I use an immersion blender and it works perfectly.  Season with salt to taste.

<TEXT> Pretty close, mister.  

I repurposed leftover grilled chicken for this recipe.  The grilled flavor really enhanced the dish.

1 lb. pasta (any shape)
1-2 lbs. cooked boneless chicken, cut into pieces
1 red bell pepper, julienned 
1/2 cup parmesan cheese, shredded
1 pint heavy cream
2 TB cajun seasoning (blackening works well too)
1 tsp granulated garlic 
1 tsp. olive oil
1/4 tsp. pepper
1/4 tsp. salt

1.  In a pan, heat chicken with bell pepper, cajun seasoning and oil for 1-2 minutes.  Browned bits are good.

2.  Add heavy cream and rest of seasonings.  Stir lowly until slightly thickened.  Add already cooked pasta and make sure everything is well coated.  

3.  Add Parmesan.  Turn off heat.  Garnish with parsley.  

EDIT:  

Not claiming it's authentic.  I got a this recipe from a friend and this is just the name he had for it.  As a Hispanic, people always label unauthentic recipes as "Mexican".  I don't care because it's really just a description or hint of what the flavor profiles and ingredients may be.  One time I shared my own grandmother's recipes only for it to be called non-authentic, so you really can't please everybody.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure if this counts, but I I'll tell it anyway.  I was raised pretty sheltered and was really naive to many things.  I knew not to talk to strangers but was brought up to believe we lived in a safe neighborhood with friendly neighbors.  

One afternoon when I was around 9 I was walking alone a few streets from where I lived and out of no where this guy called out to me from his garage.  I stopped walking but before I could respond he was already walking towards me on the sidewalk.  The guy had to be early to mid 40s.  A little heavier.    

"Hey!  You look like a pretty strong kid.  Could you help me?  I need to move a kitchen table inside the house." He pointed his thumb towards the house.  

Like I said I was pretty naive and didn't even know anything about pedophiles but the entire thing raised the hairs on the back of the neck.  Sirens inside me were just started flashing.  I just remember running away and not looking back.  Ran straight home.  

It took years to even realize how alarming it was that he asked a scrawny 9 year old boy to help him move heavy furniture.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do I install an aux in Acura TSX '05 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-26 07:04:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not sure where to post this, but I really need help. I currently have a 2005 Acura TSX with the original radio/stereo thing. The problem is that this damn car doesn't have an aux port but it has an aux button and it also has XM radio.
I have to drive a lot more now and the radio is driving me insane. I've been looking for ways to fix this but they all seem complicated and I've never split a wire in my life. I don't care for XM radio, it's too expensive anyway. I just want to be able to plug my phone into an aux to listen to my Spotify and never have to hear another radio host again. 

I took out a piece to allow me access to underneath the stereo and I can see 2 wires going into it. (I'll try to provide pics taken to display this)  From what I understand one of them can be unplugged and I could plug a kit into it. It would make the xm radio feature not work, but I don't care as long as I can listen to Spotify through my phone. I'm not even sure what the best thing to buy in this situation is either. 
Any help/advice for someone who knows hardly anything about anything related to cars/wiring?

tl;dr: I have an 05 Acura TSX with no aux port. Need to know the cheapest and most dummy proof way to fix this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably not a popular opinion, but unless you were endangering your parents they should not have kicked out their 16 year old son.  Especially one who had to grow up in an inner city and endure trauma, and unfortunate circumstances that first got you addicted to painkillers.  I'm not saying they should have coddled you, but helped you through it.  

They gave up on you, and as inspiring as your story is -- you could have easily ended up dead.  I don't understand why they couldn't have just laid the law down, gotten tough, tried rehab.  From what I've been reading, you didn't steal from them or harm them in that way. 

I'd recommend writing a letter.  Tell them you don't forget all the things you did back then and pain you caused, and never will.  That you wanting them in your life does not mean pretending those things never happened.  But you want to reconnect and be there son again.  You want your kids to know their grandparents.  If they never want to see you again because of the pain and shame they still feel, you will respect their wishes and go on with your life.  But if they don't want to see you because they believe you're the same addict you were at 16, they're wrong.  </TEXT>

I would trust buying ceviche any day from an experienced home cook than a restaurant. This is a dish people have been cooking their entire lives. They know how to safely prepare it.
 
To me this is no different from a bake sale.  I have bought items from bake sales that were for personal gain - not always "nonprofit" causes. To help a student through college. For a Disney World Trip. This is no different than that. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thanksgiving advice this year </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've been cooking at home for awhile now, but I've only recently been given the task of cooking holiday feasts for 20+ people.

This Thanksgiving my sister in law is hosting at their house and I'll be coming over that morning and staying all day to prepare the side dishes.  The problem is, she has a smaller kitchen and limited stove/oven space.  I was wanting to maybe cook some things early in the morning at home before I left -- like mashed potatoes and green beans.  My only concern is that I'm not sure how they would hold up after 8+ hours.  Can you safely keep food hot for that long?  And will the texture/flavors be compromised?  Has anyone had success using a slow cooker to keep potatoes warm?  

I was thinking mashed potatoes aren't time consuming to make, it's the peeling and cutting that takes me awhile.  Maybe I could prep them at home, then boil and finish them at SIL's?

I am doing the cranberry sauce and dessert the night before at home and then the dressing and dinner rolls at SIL's house so they don't dry out.  Would appreciate any advice, especially from Thanksgiving vets!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know I'm late but Hey Arnold! Is a show I enjoyed just as much as an adult.  Watching it gave me a new perspective on Helga who had to deal with a dysfunctional family, from her workaholic dad, to mom who's alcoholism is inferred all throughout the series.  Her mom is always a dazed and depressed, "smoothie" addict.  At one point it's hinted that she's had at least one DUI, when Helga asks her "when did you get your license back?".  And Bob mentions her having to start community service in one episode.  Also, you could sometimes hear the sound of ice from her cup of coffee.  

The whole series deserves a rewatch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My boyfriend and I are sharing the same accounting class at school.  We decided to do a homework assignment on a certain day.  I had other homework I had to do first so I tell him to just go ahead and get started because I'm quicker and could catch up. Apparently that's the same as insulting his intelligence and calling him a dumbass and so he storms out of the room.  We both know I've taken accounting before and he hasn't so it's easier for me than him.

Some people could find the insult in a bouquet of flowers.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its going to be mom, no  dad. I kept telling myself repeatedly.  I fidgeted and tried not to immediately see who was walking towards me.  The footsteps were deafening. 


Please let it be mom..  I pleaded lightly.  But I knew who was coming.  The person I had actually hurt the most.  


To my surprise I found a younger man walking towards me.  An adolescent, maybe 16 or 17.  More attractive than me, wearing black jeans and a shirt I forgot I had.  He smiled at me in a way that I never smile now.  Naturally, and genuine.  Ten years ago this was me. 


For what was either 2 seconds or 5 minutes we stared at each other.  How do I explain myself?  I just wanted to tell him how sorry I was.  What I had done to this kid.  But before I could speak he started.

This was a point in life where I could have branched off into a dozen different directions.  His demeanor was so casual.  I was standing in silence, holding back tears. 
He didnt seem sad, or distraught.  No, he wouldnt have been those things.  Not yet.  


Heh.  You know, I was told in one of those alternate paths I could have been married, and working our dream job.  How crazy is that? 


I dont know how my face reacted, but he tried to make me feel better ..but then again I could have also overdosed at 21 had you continued being friends with Eric Meyer.  So it isnt so bad when you think about it he smirked.  I hadnt heard that name in forever.  Last I remembered, Eric and I had grown apart after high school for some reason.

Why arent you upset at me?  Im so sorry.  I-I wanted better for you. I jumbled my words, and tried to say so much more but tears were streaming and my voice felt paralyzed.  


Hey dont cry.  So you made some bad decisions?  It isnt --  


I fucked up so much.  Wasted so much time.  Alienated people who love you.  Did things I could never take back.  You know, things have never been the same with mom and dad?  This isnt what I wanted for you, none of it.  we both stood in silence and his demeanor changed to serious.  


He started softly, I might be standing here.  But Im still a part of you.  We did go through a lot.  And Im sorry too for how things turned out.  He stepped forward and hugged me and then whispered, but now its time to make things better.


I was confused.  What do you mean?  What happens now?  Arent I dead?


Well *technically* no.  Maybe half dead?  Youre not conscious.  But for whatever reason it's been decided its time for you to go back."  He paused, then started more seriously.  "Youve lost sight on the things I wanted, old man.  Its time for you to finally take them.


Old man? Im only 27! I wasnt sad or crying anymore.  I understood now.  Why I was here.  This wasnt the end.  Only the beginning.


Younger me looked off into the distance.  It was white everywhere.  But far away on the horizon you could faintly see green mountains.  I had never seen anything like it. I guess neither had he.  He looked down at his feet.  We'll be over there some day, just not now... But hey, dont forget about me, alright?  And jeeze dont text and drive anymore, you asshole.


He looked at me almost eagerly, clenching his fists. Ive seen a future for us.  A good one.  You can do it.


Before I got the chance to reply I blacked out along with the sensation of falling.  In a hazy dream I could feel the air and smells around me change.  I felt heavy, sore, and dizzy.  I could hear the sounds of the hospital.  The beeping, muffled noises, nurses hurriedly walking.  


Was it just a dream?  No, I knew it wasnt.  I looked at a dry erase board with information scribbled on it.  I studied it for a moment before seeing my name and pausing.


I wont let you down this time.  Not this time.  Not again.

Note:  Sorry, I never write and so am not the best at it.  But I had to write this one.

2 cups cooked chicken (diced)
1/4 cup adobo sauce
1/4 cup diced onions
1 TB oil
salt   pepper to taste
corn tortillas + oil

Garnish: chopped cilantro, minced onion, salsa, lime wedges

Heat and cook chicken and onions with salt and pepper in oil until slightly browned over medium high heat.  Browned and crispy bits are desired.  Add adobo sauce, combine and continue heating on medium-lo until it's not too wet anymore.  Set aside.  

Heat up corn tortillas with a small amount of oil on medium high heat.  Heat until warmed and just slightly crisp. 

To serve, stack 2 tortillas per taco, topping generously with chicken.  Add garnishes as you like.

I can post a recipe for the salsa (salsa de chile arbol) if you want.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just because OP's husband would've wanted his own kids doesn't mean he LIKES this situation.  What if the husband doesn't want to watch over the kids any more than OP but he's doing it because he's selfless and the kids deserve better than the alternative?  He was literally thrown into this situation.  SIL didn't call him and ask permission and he said yes, she just showed up unannounced.

It's a shitty thing, but I can't say your husband should be demonized for choosing to take care of his own blood in a fucked up situation when no one else would.  Honestly, it sounds honorable.  OP, you chose to marry through thick and thin.  You should communicate and just hold off on "leaving" until you two can come up with short and long term goals. I know this is an unpopular opinion, but right now you need to communicate with your husband just as well as you did here on Reddit.  See if a compromise can be made.  Tell him how you feel.  Make plans TOGETHER about what you want to do if their mom doesn't show up after a month... 3 months... etc.  Maybe start setting up rules around the house for now so things aren't so crazy?  Bed times, chores, periods without TV or games.  

You don't have to "mother" them and you aren't being forced into "motherhood".  Just treat them as a normal aunt would?  They aren't exactly young kids.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you believe you are capable of forgiving him and giving him the opportunity to regain your trust, there's a chance it could work.  But there's a few questions you need to ask him and yourself about.

If he felt so guilty about cheating, why did he recently look at them when transferring from his tablet.

Why did he STILL have her phone number saved and friended on Facebook.

These things are big red flags that he may feel zero remorse from cheating.

I would say consider staying ONLY if he's genuinely sorry for cheating, not just sorry he got caught.   </TEXT>

I can understand separating on good terms, but that is usually not a normal thing to do. Until he or she crosses some clear boundaries, like flirtatious/too-friendly comments, I don't see many outcomes where bringing it up to him would benefit anyone. 

Ultimately, I think this is just a case of where ignorance could've been blissful. 

The best you can do is trust your boyfriend and know right now all those nice things he says and does for you aren't any less genuine and heartfelt just because they've happened with someone else previously.  Him and his ex chose to break up, and right now he wants to be with YOU. </TEXT>

Also, there is certainly a difference between being romantic, and showing someone you love them.  If you feel like he doesn't love you, I would try having a more serious conversation with him and maybe suggesting counseling so he might learn to communicate his feelings that lets you feel cared for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is one hard pill to swallow and I'm sorry this has happened to you.  You certainly have a big choice to make.  If you decide to stay, not divorce, and work things out you need to be prepared to forgive her and let her work her way into gaining back your trust.  If you feel like you can never trust her again, or forgive her (I wouldn't blame you) from this terrible thing she has done, it might be better for divorce.  You just wouldn't ever be happy being with someone you distrust and resent.  

It might have happened a decade ago, but each day it passed was another day your wife kept something that you deserved to know.  Almost like a marriage based on a lie that you could trust her.  

Also, your friend is a piece of shit.  Close contact with him forever, and thank his wife for being a decent human being, unlike the other 2. </TEXT>

But while I believe you're fully within your right to say no, I believe it's a fairly normal request to make between room mates, and it wasn't rude to just ask considering it was only 2 blocks away and if you two know each other fairly well.  I'm not sure there was any reason to "tense up" and wonder "why the hell" he would ask such a thing.  Based on those things, I wonder if you acted a bit too agitated by it and offended your room mate.  Maybe treating his request with respect and just calmly explaining why you're not comfortable loaning your car to him or anyone else would have helped the outcome. </TEXT>

I worked temporarily at a job in a red state with macho good ole boys who would be less than pleased to know a gay guy was working beside them, using their restrooms, etc.  (it was a bad situation but I was desperate for a job-- thankfully I left soon after) I changed my boyfriends name on my phone because it kept things easier and I knew it would mean an uncomfortable experience had everyone known.  

Just ask him about it.  Be understanding.  Tell him you want him to confide in you, instead of him feeling he needs to make excuses.

<TEXT> If you don't take him back for cruelly killing snails, don't take him back for shit-talking to your friends about you behind your back.  

For some perspective, I grew up in a household who didn't feel the same way to creatures.  Granted, we didn't take pleasure in killing bugs or anything, but if there was a cockroach or ants inside the house we would just bring out a can of bug spray and be done with it.  But now my current SO loves all animals just as you do.  To spare his feelings, I just changed certain things about how I interact to bugs to spare his feelings.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe your fianc didn't tell you because you have a history of not keeping a secret.  I mean you told his mom right when he told you not to, and then you also went off and told your sisters. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your fiance (as others have said) is really turning into a Groomzilla.  Maybe he feels like, because you never dreamed of a wedding or previously cared to have one and he has, that he should be able to make all the decisions.  I think you should really put your foot down and tell him the wedding is about the both of you, not just him or anyone else.  Honestly, most decisions should be agreed or at least compromised together.  And the wedding dress should be the bride's decision.  For him to not even allow you THAT just seems controlling.

Tell him if he's okay with you getting anxiety and being uncomfortable on YOUR wedding day, then you should reconsider having a wedding at all.  Say a wedding doesn't have to be so conventional and it can and should reflect who you are and be just as memorable and joyous.  He seems more concerned about what "others" will think of the wedding than how you feel.   </TEXT>
