<TEXT> I know it's hard, but I'd stick with the manual for your test. Anyone can drive an automatic. That's what is great about them. But you never know in the future where you will be put in a position to drive a strangers car and that car could be manual. Especially in Ireland.

A lot of commenting seem to have a 'Real men drive manual' attitude and you can ignore that. The very real issue is that if you learn to drive auto, your license will only cover auto. It also means that you can't drive other peoples cars, if you would need to (especially in an emergency), and you will be limited in future car purchases.

And remember any new car is going to feel like driving a cloud, compared to any older car you've been practising, regardless of transmission.

EDIT: Tip on gears. No need to look. If you pop the gear stick out of position it will rest in the center between 3rd and 4th. Use this. When driving, changing from first to second is easy. Just left and down. To move to third, move the gear stick pops out of gear and rests between third and fourth. Then just push up to move to third. Straight down to fourth. For fifth let it pop to center again, then right and up for fifth. 

Going down gears? From fifth, pop to center, down for four. Pop to center, down and left for second. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only the first game in the Penumbra series offered combat. They removed it for the second and third instalments because when you gave a player a way to fight they did. Combat was suppose to be last resort.

I think the early Silent Hill games did this well. You were forced into combat a lot, but you quickly learned that running was the best way to play the game in most cases.

Even in SH4, a game that gets a lot of bad press as a Silent Hill game (Critics may have been more favourable if it was spin off, as originally intended and not in the main series) you are given guns, but because you are an average joe and not trained, they are pretty useless except as a last resort in close combat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I don't get the criticism of copy paste dungeons. I mean they did look the same, but that was a design and narrative decision, not a lazy decision. The dungeons look the same because they are the internals of the Divine Beasts, all built with the same purpose and technology. Same with the shrines. It would be a design mistake to make them look aesthetically different, just for some faux idea of variety.

It's like complaining that all the locations in Alien Isolation look like spaceships. No shit, they are all spaceships. We have come a long way since games would have a Ice Level, a dinosaur level, an Egypt Level and a Grass Level. If I'm suddenly fighting mummies I want to know the reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well people aren't going to want to buy a second hand game if it is crap. If you love a game you may keep it, but most people I imagine play a game and move on to the next one. If they are not buying it on the first month, they will pick up a digitally identical cheaper copy, where none of the sale price goes to the publisher/developer.

If this was actually a thing, the only games left would be multiplayer games and procedurally generated games like Civ, Minecraft and Binding of Issac. No one will pay full price for a story based game like Bioshock or The Last of Us when they can get it cheaper from someone who has played it and finished it.

Would you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my opinion they had a strong enough story. The first twist was fine. The second twist just sort of cheapened things.

Like imagine a movie where it turns out a character we saw die on screen turns out to be alive after all. That's fine. Then another dead character pops out of nowhere and says 'Hey I didn't really die either, surprise'. One or the other would be fine in my opinion.. Not both. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think consumers need to know that everything they purchase will not be a gold star purchase. They have tools like consumer reviews right on the page, professional reviews, curators, You Plays and refunds at their finger tips. Generally it is easier now to inform yourself about a game than it ever was before, and to return it. All the consumer benefits Steam can grant to consumers still doesn't negate Caveat Emptor. I can't remember the last time you could get a no questions asked refund on a PC game since CD and DVD burning tech became common. </TEXT>

Seriously though, if Valve really cared to have Minecraft, they would have seen the early success and set up some meetings and tried working a deal with Notch. The development of MC has been really open, so it is probably safe to say this never happened. So Notch didn't chase Steam and Valve didn't chase Minecraft. Both are doing really well for themselves so I doubt either care too much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you look closely at most games the choices aren't as impactful as you think. For instance if you save Denton's brother in Deus Ex, you get a vid comm message from him but he pretty much disappears for the rest of the game. In Life is Strange your options mean different dialogue in later sequences (same as Telltale) but not much changes. There are characters who die, but the story plays out the same.

If by impactful choices you mean you get more dialogue, then yeah those games have it. If by impactful choices you mean that the story works and moves forward around your decisions, then no. No one is likely ever to make a game where your character says 'Forget about the galaxy, if the world ends, I want to do what I love.' and then the rest of the game is you setting up a boutique fashion store or running your farm. </TEXT>

It's not a big deal. Most games give an illusion of choice. As long as you feel like your choices are making a difference, you shouldn't notice. It is unreasonable for a developer to make 100 different games because you don't like one of the characters they wrote. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't played DA but I have played ME, KOTOR and Jade Kingdom. In those games choices are very superficial but give a great illusion of choice. They add a second line of dialogue which will be delivered flirty, angry or whatever emotion the other character is suppose to feel for you. If you do something to piss off someone, you are more likely to get the content cut, rather than have any true impact on the story. Or alternatively you get a very similar story branch with very similar characters. </TEXT>

It might have worked if there wasn't a slew of unfinished housing developments around the country. They also failed by thinking that the only type of housing people would want is in estates with no amenities requiring you to drive everywhere. This would never work because public transport is still shit compared to other cities in Europe, the roads aren't cycle friendly and despite worsening traffic, it is harder than it has ever been to get a license (which is a good thing for different reasons). Our city planning is till based on the needs of the eighties, early nineties. Shure why would anyone want to walk anywhere if they can drive? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think Schafer nailed it in his pitch for Double Fine Adventure. The audience for Point and Click games has been very consistent, since his days at LucasArts. The big issue is that the whole audience for games expanded and PnC games became niche. 

When the genre tried to grow with the rest of the market, they kinda set a new baseline for a professional point and click game. Decent voice acting became a must for anything people were going to drop a twenty spot on. The return on these games weren't worth the investment for most studios. Then Telltale came along with shorter games that led into bigger 'seasons'. And they could re-use assets to push quick releases.

This also meant the player only focused on two, maybe three puzzles at a time. Compare that to Monkey Island where you had a whole island to complete three tasks in any order. Each had their own chain of puzzles to solve and had some overlap. Sometimes you would be forced to solve a puzzle to get an item that you didn't even know you needed. By contrast the Broken Sword series (with the exception of the first game) gave you the choice to navigate a room or two with a central puzzle to solve, so you were always working towards one goal.

The games evolved more into the second style of game, where you had a simple goal and a limited space to complete the objective in. </TEXT>

 Now, playing it safe would have had Han and Leia married with Luke mentoring the Jedi Academy. Instead, Han and Leia are separated, Luke failed to bring back the Jedi at the hands of his own newphew, and then they killed off Han Solo - arguably the most beloved SW character. It was hardly playing it safe.

<TEXT> People need to realize that monopoly is an actual defined term that actually means something, with a very specific definition. Just because you choose to go to Walmart everytime, doesn't make it a monopoly.


Here are the characrttiristics of a monopoly


* Profit Maximizer: Maximizes profits.

Steam doesn't do this. Not in the traditional way a monopoly would. They have sales all the time.

* Price Maker: Decides the price of the good or product to be sold, but does so by determining the quantity in order to demand the price desired by the firm.

For most of its products Steam doesn't decide the number of keys available to them, nor do they set the price.

* High Barriers: Other sellers are unable to enter the market of the monopoly.

Loads of sellers have entered the market. They also compete with console sales and brick and mortar sales.


* Single seller: In a monopoly, there is one seller of the good, who produces all the output.[5] Therefore, the whole market is being served by a single company, and for practical purposes, the company is the same as the industry.

Nope. Aside from a few Valve titles, most games will appear on different stores. Plus a developer can choose not to sell through Steam (Overwatch, Minecraft, Star Craft, etc. do this)

* Price Discrimination: A monopolist can change the price or quantity of the product. He or she sells higher quantities at a lower price in a very elastic market, and sells lower quantities at a higher price in a less elastic market.
 
Nope, not Steam either. 

So Steam doesn't fit a single characteristic of a monopoly. Sure they are big and have a lot of power, but so does Coca Cola and Walmart. When was the last time you heard them described as a monopoly. And as long as Steam distributes their own games like Portal through retailers, they don't even monopolize their own goods. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I also have concerns that I won't be able to transfer my 40+ Virtual Console games over from my Wii U/3DS and that they'll slowly trickle out classic titles again.

Has Nintendo ever done this? You still have those devices? The Switch said it wouldn't have backwards compatability. It seems odd to complain that you can't play your games from other devices when it was already advertised that you couldn't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's still more of a disappointment though. Like when Spielberg did Indy 4 or Lucas did the prequels, we know they were capable of doing better. It was disappointing that they made sub par movies, but it wasn't really unacceptable. It's not like they were insulting your mother, they just failed to reach the bar that was set by their fans. Every person in the creative arts will do that at least once. Even you, when you become a professional animator.

<TEXT>   A lot of folks bash the movie for being kind of a terrible Sci-Fi film for a number of reasons, but none of the Sci-Fi stuff really matters too much because it's all just allegory in service of the main plot line - Gibson's character finding his faith again. 

I mean, does that even matter? A movie is either good or it isn't, no matter what it is trying to achieve. Robocop and The Matrix aren't better movies because they are Christ allegories. They are good movies that happens to be allegories too. Signs is a bad movie that happens to be an allegory for returning to ones faith after losing it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So you think that the capacity of a laptops hard drive is related to how useful it is. As in when you fill it up you get a new one.. or something? 

I was using it for context. If people make do with using up to 1TB of permanent storage, why would they need more than that in volatile data in a month?

If I want to host a 8k video stream of my back garden and I have a 'unlimited' data plan. That's perfectly okay.

Actually I wouldn't agree with that. If you want an 8k stream, that's your business, but private lines aren't made for that kind of usage. First, you'd probably want a line with more upload bandwidth. Even in plans with 100 down or higher, cap uploads at 25. Second a household line doesn't guarantee you the things to maintain that connection. You don't get a static IP, your service and guarantee of uptime aren't granted either. If you want to hold a 24 hour 8K stream, you really need a business line.

Also an 8K stream on an unlimited home line is the exact sort of idiocy that results in the 'one guy ruined it for everyone' rulings.

Or maybe I want download a stream from a remote location... I have an 'unlimited plan' I can do that. 

You can do this. It would still be an awful lot of streaming to hit a TB. Not sure why the location has to be remote. You are charged by how much data you receive, not how hard or remote that data was / is. Data from Ireland and the US, is the same as data from the Congo or Timbuktu. 
I have an unlimited line. I don't get charged if I go over my 1TB limit (although that has only happened once) but they do throttle my speeds after that. They were upfront about this when I switched plans. It seems fair. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's apples to a different sort of apple. 1 TB is an industrial amount of data. [That is over 300 hours of Netflix HD](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87). 

To put that in context, I used [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) to track the movies I watched last year. I watched roughly 370 movies in 2016 (which I'm pretty sure is way above average, that's over a movie a day) equating to 604 hours. Assuming everything I watched last year was on Netflix, I would have to watch a whole year of movies in two months to keep up with OPs data usage. And I could get it to fit on a laptop and a single external hard drive.

Another way to look at it is that OP would have to download GTA V (the largest commercial game download I could find, but there could be larger) 15 times to use all his data.

So either OP is hosting a large amount of data, which he shouldn't on a private line, or he is using so much data that he really needs a business line.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Remember it only takes 48 hours of full use to hit the limit.

The only way someone could be using non stop upload and download at max speed in two days is if they are hosting something extremely popular, or they are heavy torrentors. If they are hosting something extremely popular, they should be using an appropriate service, not their household broadband. 

Standard laptops come with a 500GB - 1 TB drive and they are suppose to last 4 or so years. Wording of the account aside, if you are regularly using a laptop full of data a month, you probably need a business level plan.

EDIT: I also did the math. 4 people streaming HD on Netflix continuously would still take 83 hours to hit a TB. That's 3 and a half days of no sleep for 4 people watching non-stop to hit that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is completely the same thing. A big oil company might not want to advertise on a liberal leaning publication like The Guardian or Huff Po. A vegan food line might not want their adverts on Fox. When advertising directly they can control that, and they can control what programmes their ads run on.

Youtube's model originally gave an all or nothing. So your left leaning business might be advertising and providing income to someone or org that you find deplorable. And lets not pretend YouTube news is just news. They are almost always opinion pieces with a bias.

<TEXT> I think it was a bit silly for 'news channels' or any channel on Youtube relying on their source of income being this experimental payment model where Youtube pays for the content, without approval first. Youtube is a company that has been losing money, year after year and are the only social media site that pays users. That was never going to last forever.

Complaining that YouTube isn't paying you anymore is like complaining that your parents don't give you allowance anymore.

Of course that's not even what happened. Youtube have just stopped paying indiscriminately. The money comes from advertisers and advertisers usually represent corporations. And corporations tend to avoid controversy. Pewdiepew losing his advertisers because he made Nazi jokes that some may find distasteful is no different to Bill O Reilly losing his job because advertisers didn't want to be associated with him. </TEXT>

Even though A Link Between Worlds tried to keep the game open with allowing you to do dungeons in any order (other games have done this but there was always a preferred order) nothing has been quite so open as BotW. They could easily change the name of the races and characters to make it a brand new fantasy sci fi series without people calling it a Zelda rip off.

<TEXT> The voting system makes it a numbers game too. Even if you forget about the bias that early upvotes have, people will tend only to upvote a topic or comment they can discuss.

So if I open a thread about a movie that was big in the seventies that isn't Star Wars, not many people will have seen it, so they stay out of the discussion. I once saw someone suggest The Sting as an underrated movie. It won Best Picture but because it hasn't been seen by a large group of voters, this might seem like a legitimate opinion to people.

People have seen a bunch of blockbusters, so even though Suicide Squad and BvS were critical flops, we still see them discussed much more than more celebrated movies that came out the same time. It goes the other way sometimes too. Prometheus, which got a decent critical reception (although most critics who did enjoy it, will admit it has flaws) is always decimated as if it was the worse abomination to ever hit screens here. Then there are phases, like when this sub decided that Man of Steel wasn't too bad after all and this caused a bunch of posts defending it.

We see some smaller movies float to the top. This sub is constantly recommending Primer and The Nice Guys. Then there are some topical films, like It Follows, which despite not being seen by many seemed to be discussed a lot before falling off the radar again.

I think you need to look at reddit's top movies to see the inherit flaws, and it doesn't just lie in reddit's major demographic. The movies are all recent, widely seen films. It is like asking a teenager who just got into movies what their favourites are. It's wide, but it isn't deep.

<TEXT> Decades ago most PC games ran on two way Ethernet cabling with a dedicated network switch playing against someone in the same room or directly to an IP.

Your bog standard wireless router today is a one way underpowered device that shares it throughput with TVs, laptops tablets and phones. It usually broadcasts to a central server before broadcasting back to the game on both ends. Saying 'PC games' could do it years ago is like asking why your Telsa can't run on petrol because your car from decades ago could. It is a completely different make up.

And you just need to visit any PC multiplayer forum to see people complain about netcode or hitbox lag to know that this isn't a solved issue for PC either.

I don't know how the Switch handles local multiplayer, or Unity on the Switch and maybe this should be a 'solved' issue. But you can't just imply that something that 'worked' years ago would work today. Especially since companies are now exploring server side code execution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my opinion, that means the responsibility lies in the owner of the car. If I was to see a baby crawling around a room I'm in I don't think 'That kid better be careful around me because I'm 10 times bigger and in steel toed boots. If they get hurt, its there own fault.' I think, 'I better be careful because while I'm relatively safe, that person is at a higher risk of getting hurt than me.'

I think the same if it was a bus or truck versus a car. Being the strongest person in a room doesn't mean you are in charge.

This is the thinking a lot of places have about pedestrians. In Ireland (and also California, I think) pedestrians have instant right of way on most roads. This doesn't mean that pedestrians can just walk out in front of cars. It is to show that vehicles have an extra duty of care to take when in areas a pedestrian could walk in front of your car.

<TEXT> The cameo's were badly done but at least they made narrative sense. I think they could cut out some dream sequences, the weird time traveling flash thing (seriously had no idea what was happening in that scene until reading about it online), include the scene with Luthor talking to that alien guy, stop Batman from shooting everyone, after the line 'I thought she was with you?' have Wonder Woman say 'Are you serious right now? We were just emailing. You texted me to tell me to come here. What the fuck is your problem?' If you want to add more sass, include a close up right after where she says 'Ugh! MEN!' with the most dramatic hair toss in cinematic history. 

What else, remove Kevin Costner, why is Superman always talking to his dead parents? Have a better reconciliation than that Martha shit. Have a better motivation for Batman in general.

Loads more. Don't try and build a huge Marvel-esque universe on Man of Steel. Seriously, the whole point of Man of Steel was to remove the 'comic book' aspects of Superman. If there are a bunch of other people running around in tights since WWII, doing the same crime fighting stchik why is everyone surprised to see Superman. Enchantress has been around since the dawn of time. Now Man of Steel makes no sense anymore. Well it didn't make much sense to begin with, now it makes less.

<TEXT> Is saying in nearly half of all accidents the cyclist is the offender also like saying in over half of all accidents involving a bike, the cyclist was not at fault? Does this statistic include accidents that only involved a bike?

I only ask because I know how much some drivers like to complain about how dangerous cyclists are, but in reality they are complaining about having to share the road with cyclists. I see far more jerk drivers than I do cyclists, but I hear far more complaints about jerk cyclists. And I see far more cars run red lights than cyclists do, on account of a lot of drivers thinking just turned red means it is still okay to go.

I've also found the most vocal complainers about cyclists are always the shittiest drivers.

Not saying I haven't seen jerk cyclists, but there are far more jerk drivers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Anyway, in the end either they lied and redid their DLC plans when they realized how lucrative their small updates to GTAO are, or they lied and were deliberately misleading to get more people invested in the game and never had any plans to expand singleplayer

Are you warming up for a marathon? Because that is a lot of stretching.

Think about it logically. You are about to announce a new story DLC. Do you make it its own big press release? Or do you throw it as an aside at the bottom of an announcement for different content? I don't work marketing but I presume the first one. Big content, big announcement right?

So either they didn't have story DLC planned and this just refers to new content inside of the existing story OR they fucked up the announcement by making it a small part of announcing other updates. If we decide that a company with all their marketing resources, did fuck up the announcement, isn't it just a likely they they fucked up the wording on the actual announcement?

So we have 2 scenarios. 

1. They fucked up their story content announcement (a big fuck up) by making a small announcement, rather than a larger one. In the long run, this worked out because they cancelled the story content.

2. They fucked up the wording (small fuck up) so it sounded like they are working on a new story DLC, but they just added a small content update.

Now knowing what we know in hindsight and applying Occam's razor, which seems more likely. A marketing blunder that worked itself out in the long run regardless because of a change of plan?

Or that the conservative reading of the statement was correct all along and that there was no announcement for a story based DLC, and they went and did a bonus content release (which is exactly what happened).

So 2 possible outcomes. One happened, the other didn't. One was unlikely and would have been a pretty big marketing blunder. One could have been Kevin writing the copy before having his coffee that morning. I know which one I want to believe and I know which one probably actually happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is just wrong. They update their engine constantly, like Valve.  There has been a huge update for the new Batman game.

The real problem is they aren't fixing the issues that people have with the engine, which is graphic fidelity, character animations and stuttering. Compare Wolf with Guardians and you will se the difference/ Truth is, they know they rely on story more than graphics. They are putting their money into their selling point. No one loved The Walking Dead for its revolutionary graphics or gameplay mechanics. They loved the story and universe. That's why they will always put more money investing in writers than pushing their engine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ~~Is there any advantage to reading the behemoth Journey to the West over the popular abridged version translated by Arthur Waley. 

From what I have heard the full translation contains a lot of Chinese poetry and jokes about Chinese bureaucracy that will fly over most modern people's head. The Waley translation cuts a lot of this out but also cuts out some of the stories over shortening the overall book or cutting out the cultural stuff.

That said Journey to the West is also a huge multi volume undertaking and without taking the relevant studies in Chinese History and Culture might mostly  be nonsense to a modern reader.

Is there a preferred abridgement? Or is it worth tackling the whole thing at once?~~ </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you do something at work, on work time, using a work resource, technically it belongs to the company. Especially if you are hired for knowledge work (programming, tech writing, even sales, etc.) If you write your novel on company time, they can claim partial ownership. Same with college.

How invasive that is, is entirely up to the company. Microsoft Exchange and Office 365 (popular mail service applications) both allow for admins to set *Send on behalf* privileges for any email account.

Knowing the login details of a person might be an issue, but most IT services mean that this shouldn't be required to send email on that person's behalf in a way that it looks like that email is coming from a different person. Lots of companies do this for when a person is on holidays or leaves to adjust to a handover period.

If someone was using that in a malicious way to defame you, that might be a criminal issue. But if you are using email in standard day to day business, it isn't.

It looks like OP's boss is a jerk by delivering bad news under his name. But if OP's boss asked him to deliver bad news directly, it's not like he would have the option to say no. Boss sounds like a bad leader. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Yeah, I saw a fair number of attacks on movie critics based on alleged sexism over Ghostbusters, some from fairly mainstream sources,

I'm saying this didn't happen. Can you provide any links? Where a mainstream professional critic is called sexist for giving Ghostbusters a bad review? The Lang article I mentioned talks about an overall bias in movie criticism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All one of them?

Genisys changed the lore in a way that made sense. They brought in the whole other worlds element. I would say that Sarah Connor Chronicles shat on the lore, but they did it in a way that worked well for the format.

Salvation was in the Evil Dead school of sequels where they don't even try to pretend there was previous movies and it is just sort of based in the same world. Genisys made an effort to explain why things were different, like an older Arnold and why it was telling the story from 1984 but things will happen differently. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well in the Roeper article, he mentions Nico Lang but it looks like he writes more about sexuality and gender politics. (EDIT: [Looks like he is listed on RT as a sometimes critic](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critic/nico-lang/movies)).

I found this article by Victoria Coren Mitchell who does call out critics for sexism, but for Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals, not Ghostbusters in [this piece](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/22/nocturnal-animal-film-rape-murder-repulsive) for the Guardian. This is the Comment is Free section where they basically get a new take another side of the subject for a little more balance. The Guardian's Mark Kermode and Nick Lodge both gave it a positive review, but Lodge peppers the whole review with discussion on toxic masculinity. 

Armond White has had [some pieces](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/01/infamous-contrarian-armond-white-heckles-12-years-slave-director-steve-mcqueen/356770/) written about him for being contrarian. And of course there are [these two guys](https://www.yahoo.com/movies/thumb-war-siskel-and-eberts-best-on-air-arguments-90363063767.html).

So an actual film reviewer calling out another reviewer by name is probably pretty rare (I only found Lang in a quick search), but writers going after specific reviewers not so much. And I have yet to see a piece about reviewers being sexist for not liking the Ghostbusters movie.

Maybe if I go to an extreme lefty Breitbart-esque site or click baity Daily Mail I could find that, but not from anything that has any sort of reputation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, I guess I am going a little back on what I said here. I don't think I am contradicting myself, more elaborating. And I'll start by saying most comment sections are shit and full of bile and if you look hard enough you will find every sort of criticism you want to find, if you are willing to look. Same for tweets and others of the great unwashed of the internet. Anyone who can say something, has said something if you look there.

Now that's out of the way, when I said I didn't see any critics get called sexist I meant it. I didn't see movie reviewers go after other movie reviewers. I didn't see think pieces in left leaning publications like The Guardian and I didn't see it on Jezebel or xoJane or any girl centric blogs calling out specific movie critics as sexist in doing their day to day job of reviewing movies. Roeper was called out by rando, unprofessional nobodies. He mentions one article by Nico Lang and specifically says Lang doesn't call him sexist.

Then he goes on to defend his choices and says that he has gone over his previous reviews in search of hidden biases and didn't see it.

Sorry if this appears I was moving the goal posts, I guess I didn't say where they were in the first place. </TEXT>

I saw a few bloggers get called sexist who decided to 'review' or blast the movie before seeing it. I didn't see any professional critics get called sexist for saying they didn't like it. I also saw a lot of genuinely sexist commenters get called sexist for being sexist about the whole thing. Outside of comment sections and tweets, not one professional critic got called sexist for writing a negative review though. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Extreme Ghostbusters

Extreme Ghostbusters was pretty shit and also it was based off The Real Ghostbusters, which you may remember couldn't even get the rights to the looks of the actors from the film.

As for your Reitman claim, do you have a source? All I can find is him recommending cast members, including many women. In fact before the reboot was in full swing I read Murray make some suggestions too, including Emma Stone.

Yeah, it isn't as good as the original, but the original is a classic and how many movies get classic status? Few. So saying it isn't as good as one of the best movies ever is a pretty high watermark. And it was a fun movie. Some things were better, most weren't, but jokes hit the mark and it was one of the better big movies of the year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If they moved that scene into a flashback after the reveal it might have worked. Also get rid of those giant harvesters because there is no way humanity would still be around with those. Oh and tell Bale he can't do the Batman voice and get to be the main character.

I blame McG totally for the train wreck this movie was. The trailer spoils the movie, the the opening scene also tries to spoil it too. The redirects later with China Moonblood hearing a heartbeat doesn't change that fact.

It could have been a great movie. The story was solid, Yelchin as always was great (albeit a bit more fun than war torn as Reese was), but they needed more time or someone looking over their shoulder to say why things don't work (interfaces for robots, why? USB, why? Spoiling the movie so early on, why?). Usually that person should be the director. McG sounded like he had no control over what was happening on set with the Bale tape. </TEXT>

<TEXT> it may seem mad but so did the smoking ban and plastic bag levy.

It's a different kettle of fish though. People who used plastic bags and who smoked cigarettes were never painted as scum and criminals. People have a very specific image of a 'junkie' in their head, or even a stoner. The news   culture media and politicans pushed this really far. I'm sure a lot of people in their late 40s and early 50s still treat cannabis as a gateway drug, if not worse.

People aren't going to decide drugs aren't for criminals overnight, and many will see this as acquiescing to criminals. The less extreme will complain that it will turn Ireland into a hot spot for drug tourists or becoming the next Amsterdam (Amsterdam is a lovely clean city and really what a European capital should look and feel like, but my gran will never believe that it isn't just sex workers and addicts).

I can't see this as a popular cause that people will rally around like gay marriage. </TEXT>

Do they provide jobs (yes they pay a fuck tonne for 'talent', but they also hire Irish directors and actors, crew and pay Irish artists for their music on radio)?

What, the headrests do none of that? So are you saying it isn't a public service set up for the benefit of the Irish people? Okay, so I guess they have nothing in common then.

Look, I think the RTE is as shite as the next man does. I'd say I watch RTE maybe once a month, probably less. I do listen to the radio a bit more often while driving. But I also think the Irish arts are important. Gabriel Byrne (Bracken) and Ruth Negga (Love is the Drug) both got their start on RTE. Without RTE you won't see Irish actors on TV or drama's set in Ireland. If you do it will be twinkly eyed simpletons chasing leprechauns.

Our health service is in need of a big shake up or even be rebuilt from the ground up, but I won't ever say we should get rid of hospitals. Same for RTE. </TEXT>

You also pay for schools you don't attend, welfare payments you don't receive and salaries of politicians you didn't vote for, civil servant pensions you won't benefit from.

It wouldn't be tax if it was spent on only things you wanted, it would be called wages. It is a public service and whether you use a public service or not, you are still generally charged for it through taxation.

You can complain about the quality of a public service and demand change, that's fine. But you can't stop paying money for schools or hospitals because you think they're shit. You vote for people and tell them they need to change things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So VAT already exists on those services and goes elsewhere on govt spending.

The reason we have the post office collect license money is to keep it out of the hands of the government. This is suppose to stop it from being a government mouth piece. In theory, it also means that the government can't decide to 'cut funding' if they don't like something said on the radio or tv.

Adding to the price of TV might be a bit much. If you consider that a TV can last you 10 years, that would drastically increase the cost of the TV. People would just go north and buy TV's there, or buy them second hand.

A flat fee added to a SKY and internet bill might be a way forward, but there is also the chance of 'double dipping'. If you pay for a Sky subscription and an Internet subscription you will get charged twice. And it doesn't cast a net over the older population of Ireland who don't use subscription TV or Internet but watch RTE everyday. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well it was written entirely by a 28 year old playwright Stefanie Preissner. And I think the idea was that the main character was a trainwreck and not your typical 20 something Dublin transplant from Cork. I'm sure shows you mentioned probably helped greenlight it (although apart from starring girls living in the city, I don't think Girls and Broad City have much in common) but it is relatively original. The main character has a pretty good job and is really good at it. In those other shows, the characters are usually failing at work.

I understand why you didn't like it, but I would disagree that it panders to 40 somethings. I only brought it up because it is one of the few shows that RTE have put out for the 17-35 age bracket.

<TEXT> It's more to do with their background than religion. And it's not to stop it, it is to ensure that people have a paper trail to say they aren't discriminating.

Without it the scenario would go something like this:
Auditor: I see that everyone who works here is Catholic. Are you only employing Catholics?

Employer: Well only Catholics applied. They were the best for the job.

Auditor: Can you prove that?

Employer: Can you prove otherwise?

With the rule the employer can say they interviewed 8 protestants and 12 Catholics and they can give reasons why they hired and on what basis.

Industries in NI have a history of hiring people from only certain backgrounds. The police force was almost all Protestant and so was Harland and Wolff. Before they could plead ignorance or say well that's who applied. Now they have numbers and can back up their hiring policies.

Is it the best way to fight discrimination? I don't know, but at least now it is easier to spot. </TEXT>

RTE has a demographic problem. They make great TV if you are in your forties or beyond. They don't have much for younger people. Their version of First Dates is actually pretty good, but I would like to see some unmissable homegrown original content. The last show for young people was Can't Cope and it was generally well received, as was their prostitution docu and that Asking For It doc. They could go a lot more experimental over people in their twenties getting drunk in Coppers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's coming off the back of discriminatory practices. Previously employers would hire only people from one side. If they were challenged they could say it was a coincidence and they didn't know that all the people they hired were protestants.

<TEXT> I wouldn't say Monopoly is a good game when you play by the rules, just quicker. Generally the winner is decided early on in the game. Going from there it is just grinding other players until they are out. But where is the fun in that? When a player is out they sit on the sidelines and watch others play. Why play a board game with friends when the goal of the game is to stop others from playing? A game with elimination probably shouldn't go on longer than 15 minutes after the first elimination. At least in a game like Clue, by the time players are getting eliminated, most should have a pretty good idea who the killer was, so you are in end game.

How would you react if you found out that the reason you have to spend all your money on food now was because some rich people from different cities or countries were buying all the food and then only eating 2 out of 52 pieces they bought a year or sometimes not at all.

<TEXT> Actually overtime has been pretty important historically. People would look at their take home pay and felt they could count on padding that with OT. It meant you could get a chance to save for leaner times or Christmas or holidays.

Something happened in the last 10 years though. Our blue collar and service jobs started working less or part time hours, while jobs that didn't have OT or '[banker hours](http://boingboing.net/2016/06/16/the-winners-in-todays-econom.html)', are working longer hours. So now if you work in an office you will probably find yourself doing far more salaried time that is over 39 hours a week, while people in shift work are trying to fight for extra shifts, or just something that isn't a zero hour contract. Oh and in the same time the price of C-Level or Executive Level work went up at a ridiculous rate.

Obviously Ireland isn't as bad as the US but our rights have been slipping. Obviously I would prefer everyone to get a fair base wage without overtime, but I think they have a right to argue. Imagine they looked at their means, were sensible and only bought a house and car they could afford and now they are being told even though they did everything right and planned within their means, now they might miss mortgage payments because the specific extra revenue they were told was available to them no longer is. </TEXT>

I can't imagine Maleficent going to the same store as Belle, I can't imagine Triton hanging out with the Prince in Cinderella. I can't imagine Sebastian the crab spending time with Iago. 

I mean I can because they do in House of Mouse and other shows often, but they still look mismatched, the way Mickey and Dumbo are but they still can inhabit the same world in Roger Rabbit type scenarios. You'll notice in the Princess toy line they use slightly different drawings and models so they fit better. There was a controversy when they made Merida more 'feminine' to fit this world.

I think we will both have to agree to disagree. I know animators are pretty limited to watch they can do with the female characters regardless, because they have to keep them '[conventionally pretty](https://every-flavored-bean.tumblr.com/post/112569173199/every-woman-in-every-disneypixar-movie-in-the)' so they all look like a wig change away from each other anyway. To be fair, the blog post contains Inside Out which I think actually had pretty decent character design.

I don't know. I guess with animation everything can be weird and wonderful so it is disappointing to see things looking the same, to me anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's because you are only looking at it from your own perspective. Sure you just want to play it all at once. That's a single perspective.

From Telltale's perspective they have a longer development time, early episodes fund later episodes, they can work on a story longer, they can segment the episodes into teams when working on multiple games. They can take player feedback and incorporate it.

Some of the reasons for episodes don't benefit Telltale now they are a bigger studio, but Jurassic Park was released all at once and is considered one of their weaker games. I don't think The Walking Dead would have all they hype it did if it was released as one big entry into the series. Also episodes kinda work for the games they release. Story heavy games that are mostly people talking can be fatiguing. They would be hard to play in 3 hour bursts. Making games the length of a movie works. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is Google or Netflix providing a service for Irish people specifically and operating under a government remit of the type of content they provide?

Just stop. RTE have existed for decades and for most of its history it has been in the position where almost all households have been required to pay a license, even if that household exclusively watched BBC or videos or DVDs or played Playstation. 

In recent years they moved the content online and despite broadening their content availability, they didn't change the license fee requirements. Maybe they should have to include people with broadband speeds over a certain speed. Whatever. Now they are finally catching up with the change they made to availability so that the license fee, which has always existed, finally covers their new availability model.

You can rant on and on about Google or Netflix or Net Neutrality (by the way, you need to look up what that means again, because net neutrality is about favouring certain traffic over other, nothing to do with taxation) but Google and Netflix aren't public services. You pay tax on roads you don't use, services you don't use and some goes to counties you have never visited. When Google start doing things specifically for the good of the Irish people they they can charge me. Our government already gives them huge tax breaks for 'job creation' so in a way we are paying for them.

Nothing has really changed in how RTE collect the license. If anything they fucked up by putting their content online without saying that people still need to pay for it. Probably because they were under the assumption that most households with broadband also had a TV and license anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> RTE should fund only the thing I like.

Seriously, I agree that most of the content on RTE is not to my taste, but I also like the idea of seeing serializied content starring Irish actors and using Irish writing talent, film crew, etc.

You are looking through a demographic lens. RTE doesn't do much for content for the 18 - 35 demo, which also happens to be the most tech savvy users who know how to get content elsewhere. RTE needs a shake up. Dropping it all together is a mistake and could kill a large portion of the Irish Arts industry. </TEXT>

That's right if Superman ever goes full evil she thinks the best way to stop him is a girl in clown make-up, a guy who ties knots real good, a guy's with a skin condition, a drunk Australian and a guy who shoots good, which would be mostly useless against a bullet proof guy.

<TEXT> The biggest flaw with telling people to 'vote with their wallet' is that not everyone has the same amounts of votes. For some people the inflated prices don't really hurt them much so they buy them without second thought. Maybe they intended to buy a reseller ticket because it was easier than waking up at a specific time and logging on to try and get tickets.

Other excuse are valid too. If you only go to a festival every five years maybe you can justify the expense. There is no excuse for ticket prices to be hire than flights and tickets to a festival in Europe.

<TEXT> So we need alcohol to have a conversation?

For some people. There is a reason people go to the bar to meet people. I know plenty of people who can talk to friends easy, but completely clam up when around new people. After 2 or 3 their anxiety is down and they can talk to others. There is a reason why drinking is a social activity.

And you are right, I do have a desire to drink. Maybe I drink too much, but that's not what we are discussing. 2 or 3 drinks is what you have when you meet up with people for a quiet one. That's the same as two people sharing a bottle of wine. It might take an hour and a half or two. The current definition of binging includes these people. It might be enough to get them drunk and way too much for them to drive but it is a risk most people find acceptable. The benefit outweighs the risk.

The current definition of binging takes into account the exact moment drinking becomes unhealthy, not excessive. That would be like calling drinking a 500ml bottle of Coke binge eating. It goes above your rda of sugar and Coke is rarely healthy, but a person having a coke is different than a person who sits in front of their couch with crisps and coke and chocolate.

One person is taking a calculated risk because even though they know the Coke is bad for them, the enjoyment is probably an acceptable risk. The person on their couch is showing problem eating behaviour. The same way catching up for friends with 3 pints is different to downing a shoulder of vodka straight.

One is a mature calculated risk, the other is extreme.

Also I'm glad that you have faith in the government health warning which are made up from a group of alcohol companies, whatever health consultant they can find and government officials all either working towards a conclusion they already decided before looking at facts dependant on the interest of the three parties. Health experts can often be kicked from these panels if they don't fit the narrative.

Remember how recently fruit went from 4 a day to 5? That was because grocery companies decided sugary drinks counted as a portion. The US food pyramid is just pulled out of lobbiests arse. David Nutt was fired from a UK government body as a health advisor when he said that taking certain drugs could be considered as dangerous as boxing or horse back riding.

If government want people to take health warnings from the government seriously, they need to implement warnings in a serious fashion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did you know that medical professionals are also the most likely to be substance abusers?

The 4 unit limit was decided by a government body. In truth, any amount of alcohol is probably too much because technically it is a posion. You probably should drink any. Also so is chocolate and McDonalds. You probably should never put those in your body either.

But there is a trade off. For most, drinking is social. For some it helps them overcome shyness. Telling people binge drinking is just 2 pints, is like the DARE movement of the US. It is a ridiculous standard and does nothing for public health except get people to ignore the public health warnings.

There is a real issue of people drinking too much and too fast. Telling people that people who drink 3 pints and people who drink 8 pints, 2 shots and a mixer are both binge drinkers, is stupid and does nothing to public discussion. 3 pints is what you have when you go for 'one'. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my honest opinion, very few games need to be over 15 hours. Haven't played BotW yet, but AAA games are shooting themselves in the foot all trying to be Open World. The best Batman AA game was by far the first one. It had a tight story and gameplay. There was about an hour or two of post game bonus stuff to 100% as well.

In Arkham City I feel like I spend most of my time just gliding around the city, the side quests set up some stories that were written out in the DLC. It's a good game but it's just not as fun. Yes it will keep my interest longer and maybe there is more meta game to play, but it is not as fun. It really is the race of quantity in time over quality in experience.

I'd rather play 10 hours that is great 95% of the way through than 40 hours where it is 60% good. So I would rather 9 and a half hours fun from a game over 24 hours good, because with that 24 hours good, I still have to play 16 hours of side quests that could be more engaging or just travelling from one mission to the next. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  but they're some of the smartest people on the planet! they could have gotten that drill to work without Bruce's help.

That's giving them undue praise. NASA is full of smart people and geniuses but geniuses aren't all actually like Tony Stark who can learn a topic overnight and become an expert. They make mistakes.

Either way, in the scenario presented they didn't have much time. They were working off a stolen design of Bruno's drill, which he said they built wrong, so they were already behind on a very time sensitive project. 

So instead of waiting around any longer hoping they could out-genius the construction and usage of a drill, they called in the designer. The designer called in his team, who also had their own geniuses (Bruce Willis designed this high tech drill that NASA wanted so we can safely say he was quite the engineer + Steve Buschmi's character was suppose to have a crazy high IQ) and roughnecks. Then they work with NASA. It's relatively plausible, especially compared to some other scenarios in the movie. 

Remember that great SciFi movie that got nominated for Oscars and everyone loved a couple of years ago? Gravity. Bullock didn't work for NASA, she was installing a component she designed. It is the exact same scenario.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  if the UK relaxing their attitude towards drug use coincides with increasing rates of drug use among the population.

Have you a source for this? Maybe not the conservative Cato think tank. Even so correlation does not mean correlation. Also I'm not even sure what 'relaxing' you are referring to, to be honest. I don't recall hearing about any radical change in policy in recent years.

The increase could be down to people being surveyed being more honest because they know there will be less chance of it being used against them, it could be a general societal shift in attitudes unrelated to the legislation. I know people's attitude towards weed has change significantly. My parents would see it the same as doing heroin.

Or the relaxing could be coming from the other end. There was a general increase in drug use, the current policy was too expensive to maintain or police so it was relaxed. In other words it was reactionary, not the cause. All  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's like Affleck didn't even watch the film though. There is dialogue and a whole sequence that addresses this very point. Maybe Bay told him to shut up because he had only read the scenes he was in. Watch it again. The only person in NASA wanting to send the drill team up was Billy Bob Thornton. Everyone else was happy with sending only the astronauts to drill.

But NASA stole Bruce Willis's drill design and couldn't get it to work to the required tolerance levels. Willis insisted on using his own team.

There are a lot of stupid things that happen in that awesome movie. Sending drillers into space wasn't one of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The bachelor thing was just a joke. I think what I was trying to say pre-Manson there were a lot of runaways. At the time, parents were more likely to shrug it off and think, at their age I was working, it is time they could find their own way. Or worse, they would report it to the police and the police would shrug and never put much effort into runaway cases. After Manson there was a huge anti-cult hysteria and if your kid ran away parents would be afraid that their kids were brainwashed or would wind up being part of another Manson murder.

Anyway, that's what I've read on it. I'm not American and was not alive during the time. This is all tertiary facts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think after the Manson murders, people kinda decided teenagers weren't really ready to be adults. The hippie movement was a trend and trends keep moving, so to say something 'ended it' is like saying something ended leather jackets or quiffs. But after hearing about how young some members of the family were, I think parents became a bit more weary of letting their 14/15 year old daughters hitchhike across the country and putting it down to them 'being practically of age' now and lead to the idea of the kids being shown the front door as soon as they were old enough.

I could be wrong, but that is how I've read the Manson connection to the end of the Hippie era. It was the start of basement dwelling bachelors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of programming doesn't require you to be 'good at maths'. Computers are the best at maths, so you don't need to be good. We literally invented programming for this very reason.

You could show someone the formula for calculating a quadratic equation and they might have trouble working it out, even with a calculator. You can also teach that person how to break down a formula and plug the data into a program. You can teach them to refactor code. You can teach them logic operators. No maths required.

Maybe someone working with vectors through 3D space might need more knowledge of maths, and sometimes maths can be used to make cool shortcuts in programming but you can program something to do complex equations without knowing diddly about those equations.

<TEXT> I would say Mass Effect 3 did the same. Side quests contributed to the War Effort. In the end, this mechanic didn't do anything significant to the actual war, but it made sense to the reasons why you spend a stupid amount of time on exploration.

But neither are really a fix. They work in a specific story for that specific reason. The same can be said of the Assassin's Creed games where the story tells us we are in a simulation that is an approximation of genetic memories. The stories facilitated this model, but nothing has been fixed. We don't know if this was a design choice and it is not a fix or band aid we can plaster onto the next open world game. If there is a big threat, we will still need some suspension of belief as to why we are doing all this busy work that could be delegated instead of facing the threat straight on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's great, you have an argument and you have thought it out. Sorry if you thought I called you sexist. I don't think you are, you obviously don't like Schumer, that's fine. And I'm not saying not liking vagina jokes makes you sexist. I am saying if you have a problem with a woman talking about her body, but have no problem with a man doing the same thing, that's a sexist viewpoint. You don't have to be a vitriolic MRA red piller to maybe have some views that are sexist. I don't think it makes you a full on chauvinist to get irked by those jokes, but it is what it is. 

As for other feminist worthy of praise, I personally think that is a false start. Progression isn't a competition about who puts the most work in or suffers the most for the cause. If we required everyone to get shot in the face like Malala be a feminist, we would have a pretty high bar and progression would be stagnant. Malala herself said she was inspired by reading Harry Potter and about Emma Watson, so women in entertainment are important for inspiring people, even if there are bad asses out there like Davis. They are just people using the tool set available to them.

Also as an aside, in her latest special, Amy wasn't to happy about being called brave for that picture. </TEXT>

A quick test that means you can drive unaccompanied, but with a plate. Then a full test which means you can drive without a plate and drive professionally, plus reduced insurance, etc.

Then re-test people every 5 - 8 years. If they fail, they go back to the quick test level. Professional drivers like taxi drivers etc., have six weeks - three months to retest or they risk losing their license to drive professionally.

Consider that 9 faults is a fail. He failed catastrophically. I took my first test way before I was ready, because I needed to take a test to renew my provisional license (I pass the theory and then just never bothered doing the learning to drive part for about a decade). I took the test knowing I would fail (and I did) but I didn't '37 faults' fail, despite being very nervous and knowing I would fail.

If he does truly believe he is 'backlisted' he could go to another testing center. Also I think there is a big hole in our system if you can drive for 50 years without a license. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe this is regional. I use the Amazon UK store and most Kindle books are 30% less or more. New releases have closer prices from print to ebook but I have never seen them costing the same.

Either way, unless it includes pictures and colour print which adds a significant production cost, I don't see a problem with the cost as long as the writer also gets paid more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's really more about having a macabre story, in a grim setting and trying to survive a town suffering from a plague as everyone's resources diminish. The original game is notoriously difficult because they went for quite a realistic approach. Also because the translation wasn't great.

It's an experience, but it is unforgiving. I think there are spoiler free guides now available to help you experience the story.

It deserves its cult status, but at the same time it is quite experimental and was a difficult to play game even in its day. Dated controls have been less than kind. If you have the patience, it is worth playing. [Here is one of the definitive articles](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/04/10/butchering-pathologic-part-1-the-body/) on the Pathologic experience.

In short to answer your questions, no to the 5 Nights at Freddy-esque jump scares, yes to the dialogue choices, but telling you that doesn't tell you much about the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is common. It was the same thing for those bendy iPhones a while back.

I get it though. Lets say this is something that slipped through QA. Lets say they tested durability for when you dropped your Switch and all the features of the dock, but didn't test the material against material properties. The hardware fitted the dock, what else is there to test?

Then the first week people have problems. If they come out and say 'Shit, the dock is scratching your unit? Fuck, we didn't test for that, our bad', then they have a lengthy and expensive recall case on their hands. They get all the docks back and realise the only reason it scratched was because people were putting it in backwards. Completely user fault. Well fuck, they admitted it was their fault, so they have to replace them anyway because people don't know that is something costs 300 dollars to treat it with some care.

So what Nintendo are likely doing now, is testing the unit to see if it really is easy to scratch. If they find that it is, what could happen is a recall or releasing a V2 model. 

No company is going to put itself on the line without knowing the full story first. What they do after is how we should judge them. If your friend says you scratched his car, you are going to have a look at the scratch before you take their word for it. If Nintendo go the Microsoft route with the XBox scratching disks, we will need to wait to see how the class action goes. If Nintendo acts like Nintendo after the Wii came out and admited people are throwing their Wiimotes into the TV, and they could be designed better, we will see a fix. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The leaks didn't get us any of these things. It gave us info that they were playing on a Men In Black Jump Street movie. It also said that there were internal discussions about a new Spiderman reboot, but that doesn't really mean much either.

I could email my boss tomorrow and tell him we could make more money selling ice cream because all the kids are big into ice cream these days. He might send me back a polite email saying that isn't the direction he sees our truck hire company going, or maybe even might humour me. That would count as internal discussion but it doesn't mean shit.

Spiderman got put in the MCU because Disney were desperate for it and Sony wanted to still make money off it without getting a bad rep for making Spiderman as enjoyable as diarrhoea, so it happened with or without the leaks. 

What we did get was that the perceived casual racism and sexism of the audience is still a factor in decision making in Hollywood. Oh, and a sub par Rogen - Franco comedy that was probably going to be shelved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would disagree. She gets a message from upon high from the beacon, she can understand languages others can't (something the apostles could) and she is herding together people from different backgrounds, etc. The bad guy is called Saren Arterius, which sounds a bit like Satan. That last one is a bit of a push. 

I think the first time she gets near the beacon was originally suppose to represent the resurrection. Then they started the second game with Shep dying and being brought back to life because maybe it wasn't obvious enough. I say this because the death was really unnecessary and seems like a really convoluted way to explain why Shep would be working for Cerberus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just looked it up. It has endings for different in-game stories. So it's not 100's of endings, just 100's of combinations. You could argue ME3 has the same. You can cure the Genophage, destroy the Geth, Wrex, etc. I mean it would be possible for the devs to move all the outcomes so they appear at the end of the game and not when the mission completed but what's the point? Those stories finished and they got their ending at the logical time, not pushed to the end so the devs can claim their are 100's of possible endings, when reality there is a set number of endings for story branches combined together. That's cheap. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cured the genophage because I didn't want to be Space Hitler. Did people need more motivation than that? Don't be a Space Hitler.

Honestly the genophage subplots was one of the best stories they continued through series. It was done well, made sense and had finality. The Collectors work for the Reapers was a bit forced. Also by killing Shep they lost the Beacon visions and Shep's ability to understand the Prothean AI and other abilities. These were way better than the resurrecting Shep plot which never was fully explained to satisfaction and only existed to force a Christ metaphor. The only thing it did for the story was force a Cerberus alliance, which didn't really make sense either. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The game has a fake gameplay mechanic that doesn't do anything ("galactic readiness")

I agree with this point. I wish it translated to the battle going on, but it just meant more ending options were open.

But the ending worked fine. It wasn't as terrible as people made out in my opinion. I think they really fubbed the execution. The Citidal explains what will happen with each choice and that is the ending. People wanted a bit of what that means for the galaxy but you play Shepard. You followed their quest and that was the point it ended.

The third game was easily the weakest story wise and I think the real problem was that it had to be the end of a trilogy to a series of games that weren't really a trilogy. If the second game had more Reaper focus it might have felt like a trilogy but in reality the third game is a sequel to the first game and the second game is Shep on some different adventure that they force reapers into at the end.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  it was just a crappy ending. three games full of complicated choices boiled down to three buttons. 

Man, you are really giving credit where it is not due. Most of the game gave you choices but they were very superficial. If it was a big universe changing choice, they made sure not to show you that part of the universe again. Really the only thing most of your choices meant was if one character would appear or another in a scene and a few different snippets of dialoge. 

The ending was fine, it made sense and closes out Shepard's Christ story.

I think a lot of people didn't like how the original ending didn't expose what happened next. All the DLC seemed to add was a little bit more exposition, which was appreciated but really just a recap of what the Citidal told you. </TEXT>

The other option is to find an auction, put a reserve on it, hope interested collectors turn up and bid on it. That could take months. After that, the auctioneer and whoever else take a cut, if it sells. 1200 bucks minus fees and time in a year from now or 600 cash straight up. People know this is their choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's maybe an overly specific query, but do VN's ever see a significant price drop during sales? I've had the first title of this series on my wishlist for a while and there hasn't been a significant price drop. Looking through other VNs historically this seems normal, no matter what the age of the game is.

Can it be confidentially predicted that these titles and most other VNs will never see deep discounts in the 50% region or a significant permanent price drop? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  1) That Irish is not fit for the contemporary world.
 
 
 
 2) That no effort should be made to support it; in politics, in education, or in the media.
 
 
 
 3) That efforts to support it are only a money-grab.
 
 
 
 4) That people who do speak it, actually do not.

I have never heard any of these strawmen in life.


1) The arguments are that there are other languages that would be more worthwhile

2) People are more sour at the current efforts to support it where people leave school with the same level of fluency as they started and yet no efforts have been made to change this. If people forgot Maths or English or Science at the same rate they do Irish, there would be a national education crisis. For Irish it is business as usual.

3) People might say this, but I think Irish language spending is pretty small. I'm no expert does it fall under cultural spending, like the arts? 

4) This is the biggest BS. Who have you honestly heard say that people are only pretending to speak Irish?


I think there is overwhelming support for the language. But most of that support comes from people who can't be bothered to learn it themselves. People who say 'I wish I paid more attention in class because it is part of our heritage' and then insist it stay compulsory so that their child and others spend hours in class showing the same apathy they had. At the same time they won't go to one of the bazillion adult Irish language classes out there showing that they don't really care about the language and only really care about the Nationalistic Pride they feel by saying they support it.

I think very few people want to eradicate the language. A lot of people may want it taught as a historical subject, rather than a second language. Our current system seems to be under the impression that they are teaching conversational Irish and I think it is fair to say that without going to a Gealtacht camp or school and without parents who are relatively fluent, most students would be lucky to hold a conversation longer than ordering a pint 1 year after school. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  (except for all the people that do speak it everyday without much issue in that regard, who are apparently not real at all) and that therefore it should ditched entirely

I don't think anyone has ever suggested it be ditched entirely, as in people just stop speaking it. The current educational system doesn't seem to contribute anything towards the number of Irish speakers in the world so a lot of people think it is a waste of time at schools. The fluent speaks all seem to come from fluent families. Fluent speakers without that background are rarer. You make it sound like people are asking people to stop using the language entirely from day to day usage (yes I know some employers have asked people only to speak English in certain businesses).

And as for the practicalities, it was never really a practical language. It was far too divided with too many dialects. People from Donegal couldn't always understand people from Cork, Galway or Meath, even though they were speaking the same language. The people who brought the language to schools knew this and created a codified version of Irish which is about as natural as Esperanto. People can speak it, but it wasn't a natural language evolution. It was made up from bits all around the country so kids could learn a language that was historically never spoken that way by anyone.  </TEXT>

If anything Ireland are the first to opposite culture cringe. They are quick off the mark to celebrate James Joyce or U2's global success and to celebrate Irish heritage on any global figure (Barry O'Bama).

They also need to defend their trademarks. If they look like they don't care about Indiana Jones any more, a court could technically rule that Indy is now fair game because Disney have shown no interest in retaining copyright. In reality though the courts and laws always work in favor of big IP owners like Disney. Disney themselves have stopped anything new transferring to the public domain for years. They aren't going to stop that now. If the law never changed, any studio could be doing Star War sequels now. </TEXT>

A private firm should be beholden to unions and in company bureaucracy as well. They would also probably end up hamstrung by local political interests too.

That's as weak as saying 'I can't be racist, I have black friends'. When I was a teenager, I knew a girl who was telling me she cut herself, but she wasn't like the other girl who cut herself because they wore short sleeves so she was only 'doing it for attention'.

You see, you shouldn't care what a person's motivation for seeking therapy is. I don't care if someone thinks they need it because they felt bummed out all day because the barista fucked up their order in Starbucks that morning or because their dog died. Both of those people are saying they need help and are getting it. If something trivial can fuck up your day, you probably have something else going on. Sometimes you need consulling services to find out why getting the wrong coffee is a catalyst.

Lots of people who need therapy don't get it, because there are other people with 'real problems'. Fuck that shit, you can take asprin if you are hungover (brought on yourself, entirely your fault) or if you have a cold (probably not your fault). Same goes for therapy. It's not like all therapy is chemo level of medicine that works only for the really sick. It comes in different levels and different dosages.

<TEXT> Private operator will probably think the route isn't worth it, not profitable.

I think there is a real problem with public services being sold off. A lot of people think governments shouldn't be operating businesses. This idea has gotten popular so we see public services being sold off to private companies. What inevitably happens is that only the profitable parts get sold. So in the UK they have private train services, but the maintenance of tracks still belong to the government. So now tax payers are paying to keep the unprofitable parts of businesses afloat while private operators can make money or drop routes when they start losing money.

Can't we use profitable parts of the business to fund the unprofitable parts in the public sector. This doesn't fully apply to BE but I see so many people think privatization is the answer to every single government org. Except water. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the fact that they are double dipping on selling tickets (first the initial cost of the ticket, then the Seatwave fees) is a legitimate reason for legislation.

There is also more. If someone bought all the potatoes in Ireland and decided to hoard them so only they could sell them, the government would step in. Or what if they set up a system that gave public access in limited bursts, and that system was set up in a way that made it easy for a few people to buy a large percentage of the potatoes so they could resell them at inflated prices. Then they took a cut of the resellers profits, so they were essentially getting money twice for the same product. Oh and in some cases, this cut is bigger than the initial selling price. And the farmer and the owner of the field see none of that.

<TEXT>  Ticketmaster has gone on record saying they are in fact there to take the blame for fees and service charges that have been added by anyone in the chain.

Is the ex-CEO of the company not a biased source? [Loads of acts like The Pixies, Pearl Jam and Radiohead have spoken out against Ticketmaster.](https://www.wired.com/2010/11/mf_ticketmaster/) It is easy for the guy who made millions from the company to pass the buck but it's obvious that this might only be true for some bands. I've seen small and medium bands from all over the world having to play in Ticketmaster venues. These guys are sleeping on couches after the show, so I don't see these fees going to them. </TEXT>

Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, he told me, just remember that all the people in this world havent had the advantages that youve had.

2 dollars might be nothing to you. For some people that could fuck your budget and be another turd on your big turd pile of a life.

Or also that person could be an asshole. Sometimes it is hard to tell. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I specifically stated that the US Military hypothetically has been devastated (including the navy) by a different military (let's say Russia).

So for your rationale for an improbable thing to happen, first another even more improbable thing needs to happen?

Also tyrant and tyranny mean specifically someone in power with no legitimate claim. Usually a king (Tyrannosaurus Rex basically means King Lizard king, Rex also meaning king). So an elected official is never a tyrant, unless they rigged the election. You could argue that Jim Crow laws did do this and guess how they were overturned. Dr. King's peaceful resistance.

I remember reading Chuck Klosterman talking about the very issue you are raising. Lots of people said Hurricane Katrina was mishandled. But imagine if the Bush Administration did actually nothing. Sure the people of New Orleans would be upset, but would Kevin in Portland or Bill in Jersey do anything? Are they going to take up arms and march to Washington to form a violent coup? No they are not. No one wants the US to become a warzone on the streets. and they react badly when that does happen. Just look at the Ferguson riots or Malheur. There was not popular support for either of those events. Look at what's happening in Flint, god knows they have earned a riot or two.

But in truth no American, no matter how much they love their guns, are looking at these issues, thinking 'How many people do we need to shoot before the government removes themselves or institute change?'. People want diplomacy, not violence to solve issues inside the US and an invasion from outside is just not happening.

The only legitimate takeover of the US government I can think that could possibly happen involving guns is a military coup from the inside. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know the reason it was included. I'm saying it really should have no baring on today's gun debates. And I'm of the opinion that those reasons don't hold up today. 

The US has the largest military and Navy in the world by a long shot. The chance of a US land invasion is nil. So the security of the state will not depend on militia. It will depend on the huge industrial military complex it has going. In fact a lot of nations depend on the US military for security, including unarmed ones.

If an alien invasion was probably, I would say the original reasoning stands. Until then it's just dated. </TEXT>

I find there is a general swarm intelligence in aggregating reviews so a 70% usually is a seven out of ten. It doesn't work in every case (BvS is a bad movie but is it really one out of ten bad, it deserves a three) but it happens a lot. As long as you see RT as a way to see if a movie is worth watching and not a ranking, it's fine. </TEXT>

Maybe. I don't know. I do know everyone has different reactions to stuff and to ascribe only one way to behave is a bit ignorant. Cultures, people and a bunch of random stuff can dictate how one should react. I still get worked up about making a spelling mistake in front of the class when I was 10. Right now I am worried about whether I left my front door unlocked even though I double checked it. None of these should bother me and they don't too much. If they did bother me a lot I would probably need to talk to someone.

We are just laughing at the fact SHE claims she directly needs it BECAUSE of this incident. 

Maybe she does. If you think this incident is a mild inconvenience that is fine. If for some reason she thinks this is devastating despite the fact she was only delayed a couple of hours, maybe she does need counselling because she is over reacting to things outside of what she can control. You are still laughing at someone who claims they need help. That's not cool. Even if she is 100% completely in the wrong, maybe talking to someone will get her to that place. 

Instead you laugh at her for not being able to handle life. Not being able to handle life is the exact reason to get help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, I didn't see the pre-approved list in what you can seek therapy over. 

If missing a flight can cause you high anxiety or undue stress, maybe there is something else going on that therapy can help with.
Or maybe being in a wheelchair and needing assistance is stressful, but that's okay because you are with friends. But now you are split from your friends and stuck with people who have already demonstrated that accommodating you is a huge deal for them. Not only that, you have the prospect of navigating a new airport and city on your own when you arrive at your destination, where you need to rely completely on strangers to get you to your holiday. Or if your friends do wait at the airport, you have the anxiety of if you are going to be able to find them.

That sounds like a lot of stress there and counseling might help.

It is perfectly fine for us to say she should have been more prepared, but lets not start stigmatizing people by telling them they do or do not deserve counseling. General rule of thumb should be if talking to someone makes you feel better and less stressed, do it, even if you think the reason is dumb. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know specifics but the thirteen minute thing seems a bit moot, since Ryanair wait until the last possible minute to start loading passengers. 

She could have been an hour early and their would be no way for Ryanair to know that she would need assistance if it wasn't stated previously.

That said, air travel has become a race to the bottom, especially with Ryanair. Their whole model is based on doing as little extra as possible and everyone should know this by now. I feel bad this girl was embarrassed and it was out of line that someone asked if she could walk. It also seems like this isn't the first time Ryanair did something like this. But also when travelling with Ryanair, I wouldn't assume anything as a given.

The best case scenario out of this is, if a person who needs assistance changes their ticket, the assistance request will transfer with that. At the moment, travel insurance doesn't even transfer. </TEXT>

This is the exact same thing. She is a student of architecture and houses like this were built by wanna be architects. They want impractical things like grand opening hallways (a bitch to heat) or they copy stuff from a mesh of style without trying to integrate them so they become a hodgepodge. You probably don't notice it because you haven't studied it. Like how you only notice bad kerning if you know what kerning is.

Actually here is the best analogy. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNlmRId2FVQ). That is Halle Berry as Catwoman. In the scene she is 'playing basketball'. What she is really doing is a bunch of cool ball tricks that, while they look cool, she isn't actually playing basketball and if you know the rules of basketball you will realise this immediately. 

This site is made by a professional basketball player watching in frustration as people play basketball like Catwoman. Except it is real life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah it wasn't a direct parody of any 80's movie in particular.  It does seem to be a combo of a bunch of different 80's movie tropes but no solid one thing. The dinosaur and Hitler things seems to come from something much older, like B movies like The Manster and They Saved Hitler's Brain. Not 80's at all.

The blue grid stuff was very eighties design aesthetic but it was used mostly in instructional videos or small private video productions, not movies. Escape from New York /LA would be the only direct influences that are obvious. And having an arcade. In the 80's the thugs were always punks who hung around in arcades.

There are also some allusions to the home video market which would usually have the keyboard synth soundtrack and some mad max esque back drop with bondage costumes.

So there is some of the 80's there but nothing really solid, just a hyperizied meme version of different non connected sources.

<TEXT>  Yes, and they also have high teen pregnancy rates

I couldn't find a source on that, but generally pregnancy happens between a married (or engaged) couple. They marry younger and have more kids and fewer partners. Monogamy for life is also much more prevalent. That has nothing to do with how people dress. When settled people became more accepting of sex before marriage, less religious, contraception, these values didn't change in the travelling community.

So the only thing that has changed in the community is the dress. Everything else is more or less consistent over the last three decades. Are you saying that Travellers get married younger because of how the girls dress? </TEXT>

Nothing plunging, but plunging wasn't really in style at the time. That doesn't mean older folks weren't saying the exact same thing you are.

In reality, a lot of teen girls want to push what they wear because they are told they are too young to wear certain clothes, which means they start to associate certain clothes with maturity. When they are old enough to go to proper bars, you see them dressing differently because they see that most people don't actually dress like that on a night out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why does Steam need to curate itself. It is a digital store front. Ebay and Amazon aren't asked to do the same thing. Why is Steam the exception?

The solution offered in the article is bogus too, because that is what Steam used to do and found it led to delays and was a waste of time.

Does the game launch? Do the controls actually work? Does it crash after 30 seconds? Is it what it says it is in its own store description?

Is that enough for proper curation? Probably not. So the game launches in Valve HQ, where every machine is probably a top of the line gaming machine. Does Valve then guarantee that it launches? So when the badly optimized game crashes on 90% of configurations Valve's system is broken.

Test on other configurations? Now the task is about three times as long and that is just the first pass.

While many people describe Steam as a Monopoly (it's not and doesn't even operate like one), it is important that it be as open as possible for devs because it is the biggest store front. While the customers may take a hit for it, it is a boon for every small developer out there. Would I prefer if Steam only had games that sold me top quality 5 star games? Yes. But that wouldn't be very fair competition wise.

Losing 30 minutes to a bad game may make this worth it. If games were installing malware or other harmful software in indie titles I would think differently. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess it is getting pedantic. When The Thing was made, US studios focused on a single movie becoming a hit. So all they really wanted was for The Thing to be successful and worry about sequels after. Just look how different sequels in the eighties were to now.

In the eighties, Die Hard came out and it was a hit. They did a sequel 2 years later (1990) and what did we get? We got a studio who had no idea what made the first film a hit, so they just did the same movie. It's Christmas, McClaine is having marital trouble, there are terrorists. Then they peppered a few cameos from the first movie and called it a day.

Today studios want to build multi movie stories for long term profit and horizontal marketing. The first Thor movie was a fish out of water story. If this was an eighties movie, it would be the exact same thing, except maybe this time Thor is confused in New York. Instead the second Thor movie was a fantasy battle movie and it looks like the third will be a buddy comedy.

The whole idea of a reboot v a remake is very new and I would probably only use it to refer to movies made this millennium. </TEXT>

Dahl said he was "disappointed" because "he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie", as well as the casting of Gene Wilder instead of Spike Milligan.\[28\] He was also "infuriated" by the deviations in the plot Seltzer devised in his draft of the screenplay, including the conversion of Slugworth, a minor character in the book, into a spy \(so that the movie could have a villain\) and the "fizzy lifting drinks" scene.\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory#Development) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The only thing they're adapting is the original film

They have taken the premise and themes and constructed an entirely new story. Even the callbacks are done in a new way.

In LotR there is a single source. For the most part they only took from that source to tell the story. In Batman, they keep story elements from the source and tell a brand new story. In Ghostbusters, they took a franchise that was dead and wanted to bring it to a new audience.

The first time I heard the term reboot over remake, it was how Tim Burton described Planet of the Apes. It was a new story with new elements and generally new rules. Then after Batman Begins the term really took off.

But this is all semantics. The reason why Planet of the Apes was a reboot was because they wanted to launch a new film series with sequels and a new continuity. That didn't work with that film, but did with Batman Begins.

Ghostbusters is a reboot because it was suppose to launch a new franchise. That doesn't look likely now, but it wasn't trying to tell the story again with a fresh take (Point Break, Total Recall, Psycho, etc.) and it wasn't trying to do something with the source (Scarface, Airplane!, True Lies). It was opening a new door for a new continuity. </TEXT>

The sets seemed to show how crazy everything was much more than Wilder who has, maybe two scenes that show Wonka to be a bit crazy. The rest of the time, he just seems like a tour guide.

<TEXT> He probably has enough of a fanbase to go independent. He could start his own site and either host his own videos or use Vimeo or some other service.

Youtube has been a wild west for a while, but now people want to make a living off it and sponsors want to take advantage of personalities, the West has been won (or lost, depending on your side).

Youtube is unique that it pays content creators. Instagram and Twitter have big influencers by they are not paid directly. Also Youtube is losing money every year. I think what will happen is Youtube will phase out its affiliate program or drastically reduce it. You can see this happening already where controversial content is no longer monetizable. I think soon, we will see that there will be a few whales, or everyone just earning less. People like PDP are already using sponsorship from third parties and YouTube is becoming more and more a platform for advertisers and businesses.

This is a YouTube Golden Age. We won't see people make the same money as they once did. And most efforts to crossover from YouTube success to mainstream success are dismally un-entertaining (Fred, Haters Back Off, etc.). I don't think we will see the *superstars* that we see today ever again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The choices ended up being incredibly shallow and having little impact, and I'm not just talking about the ending. 

I just finished the series and I didn't feel like they were shallow at all. I met companions based on who lived and died in my old game.

One problem was that the third game spent so much time tying up all the lose ends. All the quests were related to things like the Genophage and the Geth and other events in the game to tie everything up. Some open threads would have been nice.

The ending was fine to me. It made sense, although I wish the war resource mechanic was built into the ending, rather than just unlocking different choices arbitrarily.  </TEXT>

The first bus arrives at the first stop and takes all the passengers.
The second bus gets there in 25 minutes are picks up some passengers but not as many, so it departs sooner than bus 1.

Next Bus 1 appears at the next stop. It picks up the passengers. Bus 2 makes it there quicker than the time it took bus 1 to get there because it had less passengers to take. Because not much time has passed, there aren't as many people waiting at stop 2. 

Bus 1 picks up all the passengers at stop 3. Bus 2 is making good time, so when it arrives at stop 3 there are no new passengers to pick up. 

Bus 1 arrives at stop 4. Bus 2 arrives shortly after because it didn't have to stop at stop 3.

<TEXT> It's the venues in bed with Ticketmaster more than the bands.

In a very oversimplified model, here's what Ticketmaster do. They approach a venue and say 'Hey we want to buy all the tickets to your upcoming event. Will you sell them to us at a discounted rate.' The venue says okay. Then Ticketmaster sell the tickets on adding their own fees. 

Ticketmaster tells the bands that they will sell tickets to members of the band's fan club (mostly touts) before releasing to the general public.

Ticketmaster then says if a member of the public (but usually touts) want to resell the tickets they should do it through their other site SeatWave. Here tickets sell for a highly inflated price and Ticketmaster will again add fees and profit a second time from the sale of the ticket.

Add in the fact that bands usually have to sign an agreement that they won't play any other venue in the area for x amounts of days and that area stretches north to parts of Louth, south to parts of Wicklow and sometimes even to parts of Kildare, these bands can't even do a second gig unless they go to Cork (which Ticketmaster covers) or Galway (which it doesn't).

It really is weighted against the fans. </TEXT>

The government decided some decades ago to take the line that Travelling culture were people displaced by the famine, which meant they had a duty to rehouse them and undo the famine displacement. If they had accepted they were a distinct culture from the settled Irish, their sweeping legislation would have been seen as an attempt to eradicate a distinct Irish identity/culture, a stance which has been unpopular since the forties.

Basically it was convenient to ignore the oral history of travelling communities because it made them look less like unpopular war time leaders of central Europe. </TEXT>

Then Ticketmaster double dip by charging fees on Seatwave. So they make their money on the initial sale, then they get another chance to charge people for the same ticket.

That is not simple supply and demand, it is an artificial market place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True, it is without context, but I was talking to the general trend of comedians 45+ who complain that 'colleges are too PC now' instead of blaming their tired routines on the reason they don't get laughs. The discussion comes up every time someone complains about a comedian taking it too far.

Benny Hill used to chase women around in their underwear and it was all silly and slapstick. In the 80s Ben Elton pointed out that when some women are scared to walk alone at night, maybe we shouldn't be laughing at a man in his fifties chasing around after woman who are trying to get away from him. Nowadays Ben Elton's comedy seems old fashioned.

Tastes change and it is not about people being easily offended, it is about telling dated jokes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get that at comedy gigs you should leave some propriety at the door. But more and more I am seeing the old guard of comedians complain about modern audiences being 'too sensitive' and this is a problem. You can't blame your audience because they aren't laughing at your jokes. And saying you insult everyone equally just isn't a valid excuse.

Comedy is very much a trend or fashion and sometimes things go out of fashion. If college students don't find Jerry Seinfeld's stand up funny anymore it is not because they are over sensitive, it probably because his style of comedy is old fashion and no longer in vogue. Once upon a time Sam Kimson could scream fuck the gays because they brought the plague back and then the crowd would cheer him. I think we can all agree that this sort of comedy wouldn't fly and be inappropriate today. I love Bill Hicks, but I know a lot of it was of its time and it wouldn't be as funny today.

Comedians need to stop blaming audiences or college students for not getting the laughs they used to and admit that they might be over the hill. And it is not about people being too easy to offend. 'Offensive' comedians like Hannibal Burress and Doug Stanhope can have careers today and say off colour remarks. Some comedians need to accept that maybe they are over the hill. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say so many horror movies are just plain crap, with or without jumpscares. It is the genre with the most and least innovation. Once someone does something different it will be lauded and the director may go on and rule Hollywood. Gore Verbinski (The Ring to Pirates of the Caribbean), Peter Jackson (Brain Dead to Lord of the Rings), Sam Rami (Evil Dead to Spiderman, Steven Spielberg (Duel, Jaws to everything), Francis Ford Coppola, Roman Polanski, James Cameron, etc., etc.

But then anytime you do get a truly great movie, it is inevitably followed by a bunch of imitators. Blair Witch led to a bunch of found footage movies, The Ring led to a bunch of J Horror remakes, Evil Dead lead to a bunch of splatter movies, Hostel led to a bunch of torture porn. Halloween led to a bunch of slasher movies and then Scream reignited that genre. About a decade after Scream it lead to a bunch of horror movies that deconstruct horror movies (Final Girls, House of the Devil, Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, Scream Queens, Buffy).

Saying that horror uses just a bunch of lazy jump scares is a lazy way to describe horror. Horror movies are simultaneously going to have the dregs and most creative films out there because they are relatively cheap with high profit margins. It is a genre that a lot of great and terrible directors will cut their teeth on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Zootopia is a fine movie and maybe it broke new technical ground, but the animation award is not a technical award or special effects award. It is an award for the best animated movie, which in the category, Zootopia isn't. All the characters seemed cut and pasted from a book of tropes. The moral was a bit in your face.

I didn't see Moana but Kubo should be a stronger contender. It was aesthetically more interesting than Zootopia, it was more fun to watch. The story wasn't as detailed as Zootopia, but it was deeper and more original. The characters backstory and motives were all there presented from the outset, like in any hero story but they were far more compelling than Zootopia. Also the 'You are my quest' line was more emotional compelling than any moment in Zootopia.

But Disney or Pixar always win, so it's a foregone conclusion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But Steam let people gift these keys, even if there was a handshake agreement.

Other online retailers aren't so forgiving. Many sites lock region prices to credit card locations so you can't order from their Spanish site if you are in the UK.

This is really shitty for a place like Ireland, which is a member of the EU but the UK market usually refers to the UK Irish market, so things like Brexit and the cost of Sterling crashing can affect Ireland because the prices are lined up with UK prices.

Steam doesn't do this and keys can be redeemed in any market, but plenty of other stores won't deliver to other markets at the reduced price, by geo blocking, card locking and other means. </TEXT>

Wow, you just solved it.

Bought some pretty sought after tickets for an event in the UK. My ticket is tied to my credit card and I need government ID. This wasn't done on behalf on the UK government, Ticketmaster or the venue, this was done by the people throwing the event, because they are sick of scalpers.

Could be even easier if you just swipe your (valid non-prepaid) debit card and show your ticket. That's how I pick up cinema tickets. Obviously I'd like to see a way for people without cards buy tickets, but that method would defeat most of the bots. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, you can outright ban touting, making Seatwave illegitimate, which would get rid of the sophisticated career touts who use a combo of bots and early bird tickets to create an early push on prices. Also it would destroy the conflict of interest that Ticketmaster has with controlling Seatwave.

But you are right. People have been calling for legislation since before the days of Oasis. Every so often a politician will say they have plan to make laws but it never happens. 

Boycotting Seatwave will never work, because it is a fees company. It could easily lower overheads and it only takes a few touts to make it profitable for touts and TM. It really needs enforced laws rather than wishful thinking. Banning selling on your ticket to a mate is a small price to pay, and a price we already have with other ticket operations, such as air travel.

<TEXT> Lets be honest. Deadpool was a fun movie, no one denies that. But as far as 'blockbuster' movies go, there is a big difference between a film like Avatar or Terminator 2 and Deadpool.

In the very first Oscars they had two 'Best Picture' Awards. One was suppose to go to the film with the most artistic merit and the other to the 'Best Picture'.

They dropped the Artistic award instantly and every other cermony only had one Best Picture award. Now the Best Picture needs to tow the line between outstanding appeal and artistic merit. Deadpool would not cross those two divides, where films that have brought new methods of film making to the masses like Inception, Avatar and Terminator 2 all did.

Maybe there is something to be said for spliting the awards again. Comedic movies and action movies both have people who complain they aren't welcome to nominations in certain bigger categories.

<TEXT> I always here stuff like this when people talk about government certifications. In Ireland the big one is the NCT which is a test to make sure your car is still road worthy.

But how much money is the government really making from these things? To you it is give them 30 quid, take a test and they print a peice of paper. From your perspective that seems like a rip off. 

From the other end, they need an office, so they are paying rent or if they own it, maintainence. They probably have a lady at the front desk. She needs wages. The person to install the computers for the test needs to get paid too. And the cleaner who comes every night. And then there are other employees you don't see. There was the backend money spent to design a test so everything is up to code, that needs to be recouped. The computer systems too. Oh and do they use bespoke software? Because that needs to be paid for too. Then the test needs to be reviewed every few years to make sure it is still up to date.

If you think the government are setting up a scheme to scam labourers out of 30 dollars a year, you really have no idea how government spending works. Probably lucky if they break even. If they want more money it's probably easier just to put extra tax on the tools they use or just up income, sales or some other tax. Certification from a government perspective is a pretty inefficient way to raise coffers. </TEXT>

If an American with Irish ancestry is doing really well, the press has no problem describing them as Irish.

If someone from the North identifies as British or Northern Irish, you will still see papers here calling them Irish. Think of Ash, Stiff Little Fingers, Kenneth Brannagh and Rory McIllroy (although to be fair, McIllroy changes how he identifies himself every other day).

<TEXT> I didn't feel like it was out of the blue in the movie. But I do think the movie would have been better starting with Lawrence waking up to find Pratt and giving us sometime before flashing back to Pratt's decision. Or even sticking with Pratt but leave the audience out of the loop for a while.

There was potential. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The sequel has some problems but I think the idea of a popcorn movie has changed. Resurgance plays out like a 90's action flick. Everyone has an inner problem that they most overcome so they can have a redemtion cycle, it was very much hitting all the paint by numbers set pieces. The Marvel movies don't have that anymore, so the movei appears dated. Also the China pandering was a bit in your face. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been saying this for years. One of the few companies that ever cared about its back catalog was Nintendo by releasing their classics on almost every console. Then people complain that Nintendo are selling them back games they already own.

No they are not. They are selling you a version of the game to work on new hardware, to people who owned it and people who have never played it before. They care about the cultural milestone that the first Mario Bros. game and understand they should make it easier for modern audeinces to play.

In the meantime try and play a copy an Xbox Microsoft title or a Playstation Sony title.

<TEXT> When Max Payne was released on Steam, it was found to be the cracked version. I don't really see what the big deal is. Cracks are released for free with no license, so I don't see why they aren't fair game. Also it is more hypocritical of a pirate to call out a company for piracy than the other way round. The ROM in the article is all Nintendo's intellectual property, from the code to the visuals. I don't see the issue in them downloading their own IP.


Now if cracks had code in them that you needed to bypass to reverse engineer, then that would be against the DCMA and that would be hypocritical. </TEXT>

Until I actually play all I can suggest is that maybe it was an attempt to paint the future as where gender identity isn't controversial anymore and it's just day to day conversation.

In the podcast Welcome to Night Vale, they have several gay characters but in the Night Vale world, homosexuality is a non event. In the book there is a scene where a mother asks her son if he is having girl trouble and then immediatly asks after is it boy trouble. In that world those questions could be asked in any order and both would be considered norm.

<TEXT> But the market doesn't set the price. What happens is a bunch of professionals buy tickets en masse. Then they control demand. They can pump up the price because they have created an artificial scarcity. They can hoodwink a few people people for the tickets priced above to recoup their costs. Once they recoup you will see the prices go jump up and down. Then just before the gig you will see the market flood with cheaper tickets from people who can't make the show and scalpers offloading the last of their stock.

There is no invisible hand here. It is pure market manipulation. Ticketmaster have made it worse by endorsing the practice with Seatwave. </TEXT>

I didn't say that movies don't under perform. I am saying Hollywood used to make a lot of smaller personal projects if the actor / director would take on a big project in handshake deals. That doesn't happen as much anymore. If Liam Hemsworth wants to star in a biopic of Sir Edmund Barton, before you could agree to a sequel or some big blockbuster and then make a small passion project.

<TEXT> Alice in Wonderland wasn't really an adaptation. It was a new story (it had a story) and wasn't really connected to the animated version either. The only other Disney remake I can think of is Frankenweenie which was a remake of a live action short into an animated feature length movie.

It was okay but Paranorman came out around that time and it was excellent. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Technically, every film produced is a cash grab

This wasn't always the case. Used to be Hollywood was run like the mob. You'd do a big movie for a studio and then they would let you do your smaller personal movie in a back alley deal. Dino de Laurentiis would produce movies just for the pay check, then bankrupt the company and never even bother to release the movie. Bill and Ted was suppose to be one of those movies.

Now the only movies made that they don't think will gross big is movies that will win Oscars and the Assassin's Creed movie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never used any of your platitudes. 

How does the analogy not fit. A piece of media that you don't like is being forced delivered to you (it auto downloaded). And when you try and get rid of it you can't (initially, eventually you had to download a separate tool to remove it). Ultimately you don't have to listen to it and you can just ignore it (like the Daily Mail in my analogy) but every time you see that thing, it is going to make you a little pissed.

<TEXT> The first game was released in a pretty post 9/11 world. The Assassins were a Muslim group, the Templars were Christian. The disclaimer was put in place to show it was a fictional story that wasn't trying to make a comment on religions points of views or any current political situation. In Syndicate they had their first transgender character. The disclaimer was put in place to show it was a fictional story that wasn't trying to make a comment on religions points of views or any current political situation.

It's not that stupid. It is just saying that this game features a fictional story with people of different outlooks and views, but that is okay because it is made by a bunch of people with different outlooks and views. It's asking the players not to get their panties in a bunch because in real life there are lots of people with different outlooks and views and they can get along to make a game about something similar. 

Then people decided to get their panties in a bunch about the disclaimer. Is it PC gone mad, or did Syndicate feature an outlook and view that wasn't featured in previous games and just updated the disclaimer to include that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought the movie was a fun diversion, but after 10 years of playing the game it is easy to forget how batshit insane the plot to the games are.

So Templar v Assassin's. We have seen that before. That's just Dan Brown. You can pick that up easily. Then the Animus. Okay, so you can relive memories of ancestors, but only genetic memories right. That's a bit confusing but I get it. So why would we ever want to do that. If you are an historian I suppose. Oh no, we are looking for an Apple, what's that? Well the Apple is an artifact that was created by a civilization that came before man and was probably used as a way for man to spurn its creators, the previous civilization who is probably the people refereed to as God or gods in our holy texts. Wait slow down. And the Templars wish to control free will of the general populous to make society a better place, but the Assassin's think that is too big of a price to pay.

And tell that in 2 hours. I saw a lot of the reviews mentioning the plot was all over the place and that's true. But it always has been. I think fans of the game are used to that where a film critic with no prior knowledge that's a lot to get your head around. Also, while I love his movies, Justin Kurzel is a pretty bleak director, so we knew this wasn't going to be like a Marvel movie or even Star Wars. it was going to be pretty serious, which is a bold move for a video game adaptation. </TEXT>

They are just one part of the experience. The food, the atmosphere and the company are really a far bigger factor. McDonalds could bring in waiters but the dining experience would only change marginally.

I would say it is pretty egotistical of the server to think they have the majority stake in the experience. If find in US restaurants they spend too much time at your table, are overly saccharine and have a habit of interrupting you while you are having an important conversation.

<TEXT> How much assimilation. I'm from Ireland and was living in America for a while. The most culture forced on me was being taken to In n Out burger. But everyone talking to me wanted to have drinks with me and talk about Irish culture and Irish music and Irish Traditions and to tell everyone what the culture was in Ireland. No one said I should start listening to Springsteen, or get a gun or go bowling.

Lets be honest, some cultures are valued over others. So in my case I came from Ireland and people thought that was cool so no one was asking me to assimilate. If I came from somewhere like Romania or Nigeria or Argentina I'm sure more people would be demanding me to assimilate into American culture. But as an Irish guy people got off if I talked in Gaeilge or told them about hurling. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Dublin Live

Looked at the Dublin Live article, which got its data from the Independent. [The Independent article](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/terrified-shoppers-attacked-as-250-gang-rivals-battle-in-facebookstaged-street-riot-35343400.html) is the same article as this, word for word. So does the LovinDublin article. 

So the single source is this article. And this article has anonymous accounts.

To me what happened was there was a large crowd of young people on the streets. Police asked the crowd to disperse. They refused and it ended in a single arrest. To me, this article is making it sound like a riot-cum-gang war happened on St. Stephen's Day despite the fact nobody in the press, on Twitter, reddit or Facebook or any other social media platform reported it (until now, two weeks later).

So apart from some anonymous security guards and shopkeepers there was no proof of a mass fight. From what I can gather from the quantifiable, verifiable facts in the articles I have read, was that a bunch of youths, who probably also happen to be black, congregated in large numbers and were acting rambunctious as crowds do, like at football matches for example.

Guards were called, people were asked to move on. One person gave lip and was arrested. Hardly South Central, LA. Dr. Dre couldn't make a rap out of this.

Maybe something larger did happen, but this unsourced piece of shit article does not convince me. </TEXT>

I think this whole article is sketch. They mention it as an ongoing problem yet The Hearld couldn't scrounge up a single photo. I also like the mention of an anonymous shopper who was black and could be mistaken for being in a gang. This is a thinly veiled hate piece. *Black youths are pulling knives on shoppers and others*. It reads like the Mail. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Along with data formats, data transfer seems to be a big issue in Star Wars too.

Do they have WiFi in Star Wars? Jyn gets to send her email at the end of Rogue One so the plans are moved, but a crew member needs to digitally download a hard copy to hand to Leia. This motif is continued in A New Hope. At the same time BB-8 is carrying around a thumb drive with Luke's location on it. 

Obviously this is a throw back to 70s where the idea of sending data over the air might have seemed more implausible than the Force (even though Hedy Lamarr had laid the ground work in the 60s) but data storage and transfer seems to be widely contradictory in the SWU. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Story wise, there is no real good game to start at that isn't AC1 and then play straight through. 

AC is a bit retetitive but the modern day story elements are pretty crucial. Then you are pretty much stuck up until AC 3 to finish Desmonds story. Even if Revelations is filler, there is a lot fo background stuff that is important and it also has Desmond coming out of his coma.

You could start at 4 and play through to Syndicate I suppose, but then you miss AC 2 and Brotherhood. So start at the first game or the fourth game. The only game you can really skip is Unity. Syndicate does a good round up of the modern story so far with the WWII stage so maybe you could start there too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Underpowered graphics isn't a problem. If Layton want to animate a hand-drawn sequence, it is suddenly for HD instead of the 400 pixels of the 3DS.

Also the Switch is obviously marketed as a TV console with a portable experience like the Wii U, not a full blown handheld like the DS line. It looks too big to be truly portable. A backpack system, not the inside pocket of a jacket system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The games fall into a nice little bracket that suits handhelds perfectly. They are too deep for mobile apps and they aren't big enough for a full blown console experience. 

A game like Layton with its cute animated scenes and puzzles that work really well with touch. Move that to a big screen, suddenly all your cutscenes need more fidelity which costs more money. Same with the puzzles. Now a game that shifts roughly 2 million units a release needs higher production values and it will eat into its profit.

But Layton isn't a Nintendo game, so what about Pokemon? Put it on a larger console and now it isn't just being compared to other gameboy RPGs, it is competing against Final Fantasy or Skyrim or other main console releases (obviously we don't know what releases are coming to Switch yet, so these are examples). The Pokemon models are pretty simple and maybe have a handful of animations. The maps and the overworld can be bare bones. That works fine on handhelds. Put it on a console and people want to know why can't they see wild Pokemon in the grass or have a whole team of Pokemon follow the player.

Pokemon is really popular and will sell loads no matter what, but again all this upscaling comes with dev costs and eats into profits.

Fire Emblem has really simple animations and pixel art elements. People will wonder why not full 3D models like Breath of Wind or something.

If Nintendo don't continue with other handheld systems we are going to lose a whole type of game. The smaller, often experimental games that are great to play on a bus, or train or fun to play in short bursts, but offer more depth than mobile games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To me 'still holds Jo's would mean that it plays in a way that is similar to modern games. I would say games like Super Mario Bros. and Sonic still hold up because a 10 year old could still play them and have fun.

I would say a lot of PS1 games don't hold up because their control schemes seem clunky. I would say a game like Deus Ex only slightly holds up but can be improved with mods. I would say Fallout doesn't hold up because in the years since release almost every aspect of the game has been improved on. 


That's not to say it is not a classic or you won't have fun with it if you put in the effort. But that is the thing you have to put in effort, whereas if you played the game on release it would have been a lot more fun without added effort.

I think Metroid is a good example. If someone asked me if Metroid was worth playing, I would say they would probably enjoy Metroid Zero Misson more. Not that Metroid is not fun, but it is missing things like maps, saves, the screen might flicker at times that is extra effort for the player without it adding to the experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the best way to learn a game is through in-game tutorials. I can read and reference a manual all I want but nothing beats a story guided tutorial. Like playing a board game the first time. The quickest way to learn most of them is to jump right in with someone who played before.

Fallout is built so that you need to restart the game fresh a couple of times because you mess up important stuff early on. Compare that to Deus Ex (this title is from a later time but I choose it because it is one I'm very familiar with) if you Fuck up and put all your points into swimming, you are not going to have to start fresh because you are still learning the mechanics. Even Fallout 3 had the early vault so you know what you are getting into. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the interface is a good reason why it doesn't hold up well. Even if you get used to the interface and its weird take on turn based movements, the game itself is a little too open ended.

I've attempted to play it around three times and given up after about three hours on my most dedicated play through. To get me through the initial confusing guide a looked at a walkthrough. Pretty soon I found I wasn't even playing the game, and I was just following the guide. Not only did I have a problem with figuring out what to do next, there was a big problem on how to do things next.

I've played a lot of old school point and click games so I'm used to games that seem really open about what your next steps are but Fallout just bamboozled me. I don't think I could recommend the game. The Civ games are easier to pick up and play. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was unemployed renting a single room in a shared house living off unemployment, I got laid way more than I did when I was working. Why? Because I had more time to go out and meet people and build relationships with women.

You've just made an excuse and are sticking with it. The reason you don't see beatiful women with janitors is because the janitors you know don't have beautiful wives (in your opinion). You don't have the opportunity to see a bunch of a janitors on tv to rate them. How many janitors do you even know? Have you met their wives.

You also need to remember that every wife of an  athlete you see, probably just had her make up done by a professional on top of their field and the clothes they are wearing are all fitted and designer.

Put the janitors wife in a designer fitted dress and get her make up done, she will probably look a lot better. And the athlete's wife probably looks drab in a Wal-Mart hoodie too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is a reason to dislike him.

Cuba has an interesting history with LGBT rights and we can only speculate how Che would have felt, but Castro would have had similar views as Che at the time, but sometime in the 80's he (or the general Cuban administration) seemed to do a 180 and Cuban government attitudes towards gay people in Cuban media changed drastically.

Just look at this [video from the Reagan press secretary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAzDn7tE1lU) that basically treated concern for gay people dying from AIDS as a joke. In 1981 the Cuban government was releasing publications that homosexuality was another facet of human love. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Herge (creator and writer of Tintin) was a big racist too. But when he actually started researching the nations Tintin would visit and talking to natives (admittedly far too late into Tintin's success) he had a change of heart. He even went as far as to redraw panels in his older comics to remove content he thought was offensive with his new outlook. If I recall correctly he (and his estate) pledged never to print Tintin in Tibet in China because hina would have him change the title.

I'm pretty sure Seuss had a similar revelation and was not happy about his war era deceptions.  </TEXT>

It doesn't matter if he plays the character or Owen Wilson. And in pretty much every incarnation there is a male lead who isn't good looking or charming but somehow gets attractive women who are significantly younger than him.

<TEXT> Wasn't even that great of a business man. He did get fired from Apple. For every great concept he had, he stole five others and stole or came up with another four or five bad ideas.

I honestly think that Apple's success was Apple going through a Golden Age. Apple was already considered a high end brand for creative type people. They innovated with a combination of fashion with tech that was just about to break anyway. Blackberry needed to break out of the stagnated business market, MP3s needed a way to go main stream. iTunes and iPhone made Apple a market player again and the iStore and iTunes meant they would never go poor again (the same way Steam means Valve don't need to make video games, despite being a video game company).

Apple hit these emerging markets and became early market leaders. This may or may not have been because of Jobs, but they were already trending off as the alternative cool brand and I think they just had their second lightning in a bottle moment. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Are we allowed to say that I don't think this trailer is good?

Of course. You are allowed to have an opinion. The whole premise of the movie is that it is The Expendables in the Batman world, so if you can't get behind that you were probably never going to like it. 

To me, this trailer looked like it a fast paced action movie with fun characters, that for the most part wouldn't take itself to seriously (Joker being the exception). In the end we got a movie that had the same deadpan stick in its ass that Man Of Steal and Batman Vs Superman had and while I can't really fault the casting or performances, there was just nothing there.

If WB can get their finger out of their ass and actually make one DCU film that is worth watching I would love to see a Will Smith Deadshot movie or a Robbie Quinn movie. I would love for Leto to have an actual chance to play Joker, rather than cameo.

Steam's UI is still looking old and dated. Core updates seem to push to Big Screen instead of the desktop experience.

But Steam is not a monopoly and people need to stop saying it is. They have the largest market share and probably the largest library, but that doesn't make them a monopoly. Coke isn't a monopoly because it sells more than Pepsi. We don't describe WalMart or Amazon as Monopolies. Just because you go to Steam first before checking Origin, uPlay, GOG or the Humble store doesn't make them a Monopoly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Grown up movie starts:

Up. Obvious.

Wall E. They tell an apocalyptic tale about the Earth being destroyed by wreckless endangerment of the environment.

Finding Nemo. A domestic scene, hit by tragedy when a husband loses his wife and his kid gets hurt.

Inside Out. They do a quick story about losing your innocence and childhood wonder. It could be argued that this goes through the whole movie but it is all really set up in the first act and most of the rest of the movie is stagnated in that moment while Joy has her adventure.

It's actually written down somewhere. I mentioned it to a animator friend and he confirmed that there is an actual formula and he confirmed that the first minutes are for the parents and have themes that the kids might not notice. This was a while ago and we were drinking so I wasn't taking notes. Sorry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. So in UP! there is the obvious start about his wife dying and not being able to have kids. Then the middle emotional part when Russel mentions his father. New outlook is when Carl joins Russel to get his merit badges and isn't such a grumpy bastard anymore.

Inside Out has the death of Bing Bong as its big emotional part. Joy learning she needs sadness too. Toy Story 2 has Jessie's song for its midpoint feels. Monsters Inc. has Boo getting upset when Sully is teaching others how to scare, then Mike rebuilding Boo's door. Toy Story 3 has the incinerator and then then Andy passing the toys on. That's just going from memory. I know people loved Inside Out, but anticipating the formula I couldn't enjoy it and I really don't get excited for Pixar movies anymore. </TEXT>

If no one wants to turn up, then the winner is by vote and the vote is by anyone who has the twenty odd dollars to join. Also past winners include The Shinning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With Cars, Brave and The Good Dinosaur, Pixar is just not the stamp of quality it used to be. Even its hit movies seem very formulaic after a while. There is the first 15 minutes for the grown ups, there is the overly emotional tragedy about 3/4 ways through to make you cry in front of your SO/kids, and then the new outlook on life ending. To be fair, that ending applies to a lot, but Pixar have it in every movie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For Fury Road, Miller wrote loads of back stories for characters. Thing is, he didn't bother filming them.

<TEXT>  The whole safe space cultural seems to be an American thing and even at that

It's actually nothing new. The terminology is new, but they have existed for years, yes even in Ireland. People complain that life doesn't have trigger warnings and it doesn't. But you know what reddit has? NSFW/NSFL tags. You know what that is, it's a trigger warning. Telling people that 'Hey maybe you have a sensitive disposition or maybe you had a friend die in a car crash recently so you probably don't want to watch the movie crash right now' is just politeness, not PC gone mad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With the young Muslims, I suggested that mocking the prophet Muhammad was no reason for the atrocities which happened at the Charlie Hebdo office.

No matter what you think of Hedbo, pretty much no one is trying to pretend that murder is okay.

In fact, this whole article is wank. Lets not pretend this person has anything new to say. She is getting offended by people getting offended. She is just a different type of snowflake. And she is not saying anything of value. In fact he is showing his own thin-skinnedness. 

If you are going to talk on topics that are controversial, and people question you or challenge you on it, don't call those people 'Generation Snowflake'. Be prepared to defend your opinions and not write off people as playing victims for the mere thought of saying something you disagree with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mutants will always be a metaphor for some under privileged or oppressed class. But if you really think about it, actual people would probably be more sympathetic to people born with as mutants (an accident, something they couldn't prevent) over the guy who was fucking around with gamma rays and now destroys city blocks when he gets angry or the Fantastic Four who pushed the limits of science and used themselves as canaries in their experiments. 

Also I'm not up to date with the comic lore, but how does the average Joe see someone like Cyclops and think he is a mutant and then see Spiderman and think he is not. Spidey's identity is secret, so even if he is open about how he got his powers, wouldn't people just presume he was lying and was actually born a mutant, and therefore face the same prejudices as the Xmen? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  No rational person

People think Sandy Hook never happened or was staged. People think 9/11 was an inside job. What planet have you been on where a bunch of nations will just believe stuff because the government says so. The world is the closest it has ever been to doomsday because people see Dr Manhattan as a US super weapon. That US super weapon ends up killing millions of people. That is people's worst fears come to life. That is 12 o clock on the meter. America saying 'it wasn't me' isn't going to solve that.

A live body and a dead body contain the same number of particles. Structurally, theres no discernible difference. Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts. Why should I be concerned?

That's Jaden Smith, /r/im14andthisisdeep talking. Of course there is a difference between 130 pounds of meat or plastic and a living sentient being. Even a nihilist would admit that.

Also the 'smartest person in the world' isn't going around telling people he is the smartest person in the world every five minutes. And his password isn't practically written beside his computer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't mind so much, except who really doesn't know Batman or Superman or Spiderman's story at this stage. I always think Arkham Asylum did Batman well. We are just popped right into the story, Batman is taking Joker into Arkham and he meets Commissioner Gordon. No explanation on how these people know each other because we are expected to have rudimentary knowledge of the characters. Imagine if every Sherlock Holmes movie started with the day he got addicted to coke and became a detective. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  can find a lot more to enjoy in the rival philosophies made manifest by our "heroes."

The rival philosophies are shallow and the ending doesn't make narrative sense. If people were afraid Dr. Manhattan was an American super weapon, pinning the blame of the deaths of a million people is going to make people trust the US less, not more. The domestic attacks will be written off as a false flag attack. </TEXT>
