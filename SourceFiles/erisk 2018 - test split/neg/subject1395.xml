<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Looking for May-August 31st subletter for 1 Bedroom in Medford Apartment. We will prorate May, as we weren't able to find a sublet in time for May 1st. 

10 minute walk to Tufts. Right off Boston Ave, bus stop is 2 minute walk. 

Room is about 11'x15'? On the second floor off of the common area. Has one window, medium closet. Tons of storage space in the back of the house. Nice kitchen with full size fridge/stove/oven/dishwasher. 

Big common space. Second floor front porch. Free laundry in basement. Room for one car in the driveway. Three existing roommates (24-28 professionals), two on third floor, one on second floor. Really nice people. We're moving out because there isn't a lot of room for my girlfriend and I. I commute to Boston for work and it's about an hour by public transit - much faster by car. Close to lots of restaurants, Stop Shop/Trader Joes/Whole Foods, Davis Square (Red Line) and some nice places to walk/run/bike. Nice management company, very responsive. No first/last/security. Utilities are reasonable and split with roommates evenly. 

Let me know if you have any questions, want pictures or want a tour! </TEXT>

<TITLE> RAV4 Fob issue </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-07 05:04:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi there. Quick question for you guys. 

My girlfriend's mother has a 2012 (I believe) RAV4, and the battery is dead. I only know as much as I have overheard over the phone, but apparently AAA can't jump the car, as you can't get it to start without the key fob. Well she has the fob, but evidently the fob's programming is only held in memory while the car has power. Or at least that is what AAA is telling her. I'm not nearby to look into it myself, but I'd like to see if we can save her a few hundred on the tow and reprogramming. 

My girlfriend found something online about reprogramming the fob with a series of -opening-the-door-turn-the-key-remove-the-key-etc. actions. Any truth in this? The tow is coming tomorrow afternoon I believe, so I'd love to know if we have other options. 

Thanks a lot for any help you can give! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also basically you need to think of a cable as the wires inside the insulation. It's not just one rubber cord. If the whole cable is screwed up like that there's a problem with the wiring inside it. If you buy a nice cable that keeps those wires protected, it lasts way longer. The cable I linked has Kevlar mesh over is and aluminum terminations, so it's super beefy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looking for May 1st-August 31st subletter for 1 Bedroom in Medford Apartment. 
10 minute walk to Tufts. Right off Boston Ave, bus stop is 2 minute walk. 
Room is about 11'x15'? On the second floor off of the common area. Has one window, medium closet. 
Tons of storage space in the back of the house. Nice kitchen with full size fridge/stove/oven/dishwasher. Big common space. Second floor front porch. Free laundry in basement. 
Room for one car in the driveway. 
Three existing roommates (24-28 professionals), two on third floor, one on second floor. Really nice people. 
We're moving out because there isn't a lot of room for my girlfriend and I. 
I commute to Boston for work and it's about an hour by public transit - much faster by car. 
Close to lots of restaurants, Stop Shop/Trader Joes/Whole Foods, Davis Square (Red Line) and some nice places to walk/run/bike.
Nice management company, very responsive. No first/last/security. Utilities are reasonable and split with roommates evenly.
Let me know if you have any questions, want pictures or want a tour! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This exactly. Traffic generally results from a long line of cars creating slowdowns in waves. If people merge properly, it's always better to split into two lanes. 

It's the same with lane closures on the pike - you create more traffic by all forcing into the one open lane rather than pulling up to the construction in another lane and merging - but people freak out and don't realize this. Instead they refuse to let anybody cut in because they "didn't wait in line". </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-04-13 20:19:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I work in a hospital - one of our child playrooms has a new XBox One, but we can't use it online. We want kids to be able to play Lego Star Wars, etc. off the disc. 

We don't have it connected to XBL - is that doable? We've gotten it to play games once in a while, but now we keep getting the 0x8027025a error, Xbox took too long to start the app. 

Some googling turned up three fixes:

1. Hard reset. Didn't help.

2. Factory default. It's been doing this since we took it out of the box, so it seems very unlikely. 

3. Call Microsoft and get a warranty replacement. 

Does anyone have any input about fixing this? If Xbox without XBL is impossible, I'll just tell them to return it.

<TEXT> Currently using Senn HD280 Pro with cable mod while on the go/commuting - and Senn 598Cs at home sans DAC/Amp. I'm considering a Schiit stack, but I'm not sure if I'd prefer to buy a $300 set of headphones instead. Are there any options at $300 that will be as much an upgrade as adding a modi/magni? 

Another question - I love Massdrop for giving me another excuse to get rid of my rent money a week early: what I'm trying to figure out is how often the deals they have are actually that good... I know Monk+ deals get people hot and bothered, but I keep frothing over the Fostex Purplehearts (which I won't be able to justify any time soon). I see things like the HE350s, but people seem to be upset that they are never as cheap as amazon, etc. Any input? </TEXT>

Bring the syrup back to boil on high for 5 minutes. Pour into jar over peppers. Lid them. Stick em in the fridge. Attempt to let them sit a few days/a week. Fail to wait long enough.

<TITLE> Room for Rent near Tufts! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-05 22:24:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Looking for May 1st subletter for 1 Bedroom in Medford Apartment. 

10 minute walk to Tufts. Right off Boston Ave, bus stop is 2 minute walk. 

Room is about 11'x15'? On the second floor off of the common area. Has one window, medium closet. 

Tons of storage space in the back of the house. Nice kitchen with full size fridge/stove/oven/dishwasher. Big common space. Second floor front porch. Free laundry in basement. 

Room for one car in the driveway. 

Three existing roommates (24-28 professionals), two on third floor, one on second floor. Really nice people. 

We're moving out because there isn't a lot of room for my girlfriend and I. 

I commute to Boston for work and it's about an hour by public transit - much faster by car. 

Close to lots of restaurants, Stop Shop/Trader Joes/Whole Foods, Davis Square (Red Line) and some nice places to walk/run/bike.

Nice management company, very responsive. No first/last/security. Utilities are reasonable and split with roommates evenly.

Let me know if you have any questions, want pictures or want a tour! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel that a cable should follow the natural twist of the wiring. A good wire should coil loosely and store flat. None of that packaged shit that comes twist-tied into a tight bundle. That ruins the coil.

Flat cabling generally has zero options for shielding, but round cables have varied twist rate and shielding options. Flat cables seem nice for short flexible runs in installed systems, but they're just a novelty in headphones and the issues outweigh any benefits (of which I can't think of any) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the review. I just want to clarify something on the Bose end. I worked for Bose for two years doing product support though. From 2014 to 2016 I was doing those warranty replacements. Two things have changed in the last year: warranty replacements and repairs for home theater systems are getting more scarce and support after the first year is becoming nonexistent, and they laid off 95% of their Massachusetts support staff and sent the jobs to the Philippines (also more and more of the manufacturing is taking place in China and Mexico)

I still like my Bose products - but I still give corporate the finger when I drive by on I-90.  </TEXT>

What people here don't get is that if you want a fucking breakfast sandwich in Worcester you go to Annie's Clark Brunch.

[Here's the cable I use](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R11WPK4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s03?ie=UTF8 psc=1).

It's a bit weird because you need to remove the cable and the little molex connector thing from the headphones. I took the bare filament wires and soldered them to the connector. It's got a joined ground, so don't let that confuse you. I have a [picture of the connecter](https://i.redditmedia.com/kt2rE1REPIQjfp5-EMD3u2ENa7xvsGJZUEjTzqk4pmU.jpg?w=576 s=56fc34547ee8a0d3989b935bfb4cb8c1) here.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Room for rent in medford right by tufts </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-12 20:32:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm moving out of my apartment on Quincy St and I am looking for someone to take over the lease from April 1 to Aug 31 of this year. It is a great spot - about 7-10 minute walk from Tufts campus. It is a big apartment, too - 3 other roommates (2 guys, 1 girl), spread over 2 floors, 2 bathrooms. They are all 25-30 or so working in the area. This room is on the same floor as the girl roommate, the common area, and the kitchen. She is extremely kind and clean and quiet. Also, free washer and dryer in basement. The apartment also has a big storage room in the back and a second-floor porch. The room itself is maybe 15'x11'. 


The reason I am moving out is because my girlfriend and I don't have a lot of room. It's just big enough for our 2 desks, a dresser, a full bed, a large ikea bookshelf with a tv on top... so if you're 1 person looking for a good size room, there's plenty of space. Good sized closet and one window. 


It's 937.50 a month plus utilities, which are reasonable as they're split between roommates. No first/last/security! SUPER responsive and nice management company, plus direct access to the landlords as well! Driveway parking for one car, free parking up the street too. 


Really nice spot, 15 minutes from Davis (or the 94/96 buses down the street go there), close to like eight different take-out places, 10 minutes from Stop   Shop and Whole Foods. 


Happy to send you pictures or give you a tour. Let me know if you have any questions! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I went the last three years and I have been less into it each year. I think it was more exciting when it was smaller - more interesting booths, more swag, more social opportunities. Last year I spent most of my time hanging out with friends and playing board games. If you have a group, it's great. If not, don't buy more than one day. Honestly the one thing I like the most is that you can join a D D game or LFG around the board game area. 

There are some demo booths that are cool, but it's rarely worth waiting an hour to play 10 minutes of a sub-AAA game. 

As for the LAN thing, there's a chance, as there is a free-pc sort of area, but I have never tried it, so I don't know if you'd have any more luck there than just posting on /r/boston or craigslist...

As for me, I am horrible at RTS, or I would take you up on it :) </TEXT>

Annie's Clark Brunch - next to Clark and it will change your life. 

Nicks - German style bar near Kelly Square. Best bartenders in the city. 

That's Entertainment - If you are a nerd about anything, this place is incredible. 

Da Lat - tiny Vietnamese place, super cool peoples and great food (lots of Vietnamese in Worcester, I hope you like Pho)

Mass Liquors - great liquor store - small but great. 

Crompton Collective - Cool antique-ish art/furniture store. Cool stuff if you're decorating. 

I'm sure there are more. I lived in Worcester for 7-8 years and I love the place. Let me know if you have more questions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What are the chances that Mytha was a puppet of some more relevant power? I guess that's kind of a reach, but if we assume that the manikins were puppets, who knows. 

From the Wiki:

A fickle queen gave them life, and tore off their faces. How else could she forgive those who dared gaze upon her? The peculiar art of puppetry is a vestige of the two lost lands. A queen breathed life into these dolls with the very miasma that afflicted her poison-drenched bosom, so that she would have slaves to serve her temperamental will.[1]
These advanced puppets were given life by the Baneful Queen, and she uses them to lure unsuspecting fools into her traps. Once upon a time, the Manikins had heads, but the Queen ripped off their faces in a fit of rage. Watch yourself, or yours will be next.[2]

Also I know they were featured prominently in the DS2 trailer, and they used to have masks, but those were pulled in development. Maybe significant? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's doable if you're on your first run. The game doesn't really cap your level, so unless you want to stop leveling at a certain point (for PvP), you can invest some souls in magic to see how you feel about it. Keep in mind, you need Int for Sorceries, Faith for Miracles, and Attunement just to equip spells. You'd need to put a lot of points into those to get good at casting, so it's a lot of souls. Usually you can get similar ranged-cheese-abilities with a bow/crossbow as a melee character without dumping so many points.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I feel like you would like this - I have an app called Corsair Effects Engine that let you turn your keyboard/mouse into an audio spectrum analyzer. So it flashes alone with music/sound. It's ridiculously cool, and it's more fun than the effects you can normally find.

<TEXT> I'm a bit late, but:

Corsair K70 RGB Cherry MX Browns - I have the LEDs set up with a rainbow spectrum analyzer, so it dances around in different colors to the music. 

Logitech Proteus Core G502 - love this mouse. 

Sennheiser HD598Cs - amazing headphones, [I recommend this cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00KAKBHKM/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8 psc=1).

Antlion ModMic Unidirectional - clips onto the side of your existing headphones. This is great because I can switch headphones really easily while still using my mic. 

Bose Companion 2 II speakers - better than the series III. Got for free when I worked for Bose. 

Dell u2515h monitor on a dual vesa mount with a u2415h. Made the mistake and bought a 24" and a 25". Shame. Will upgrade some day. 

Next up I'm saving for a Schiit Modi 2 and Magni 2 DAC/amp combo.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> IP Video Server - Trying to rip DVDs to the right format... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-06 13:47:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So let me know if there is a better place to post about this!

I work at a hospital and I have been given control of the video server running movies on the TV channels here. We use an older Leightronix Nexus server. I was trained on how to queue movies for our weekly schedule, but I am trying to dig a bit deeper and try to add more movies to the server. My coworkers don't really know any more about this system than I do.

Leightronix has their own import tool for DVDs, but it runs into what I can only assume are copyright issues every time I try to rip a DVD. The problem is, the server disc management software only recognizes very specific files:

Acceptable stream types: MPEG-1 System Stream or MPEG-2 Program Stream (consisting of a single elementary video stream with an optional single elementary audio stream)
NOTE:  Transport stream is not possible.
Elementary video stream

Three video resolutions (pixels) are allowed.  Other resolutions are not supported. 352 x 240 (Horizontal x Vertical)
352 x 480 
720 x 480

Picture rate must be 29.97 pictures per second.
A maximum bit rate of 10 Mb/s is allowed.  Higher rates are not supported.
National TV Standards Committee (NTSC) with 4:3 aspect ratio required.
4:2:0 sampling format required.  (Main profile at Main or Low level, 10 Mb/s max)
IBBP group of pictures (GOP) structure recommended for best quality (30 frame maximum GOP size).
Encode header information in stream every few seconds to aid in error recovery.
Audio, if present, must be encoded into the MPEG file using Audio layer II.
Audio may be encoded at a 32, 44.1, or 48KHz sampling frequency.  LEIGHTRONIX recommends an audio sampling rate of 44.1 KHz for optimal performance.
MPEG filenames may contain up to 27 characters (no spaces) in addition to the required ".mpg" extension.


I know that's ridiculously restrictive, but I really want to be able to broadcast newer movies (instead of forcing children to watch The Sandlot twice a month...) I have ripped a few DVDs with different settings in VLC, but I really don't know enough about video format/bitrate/containers/etc here - trial and error will just take forever. 

If I'm asking the wrong thing (re: copyright), can you recommend a more modern video serving option? 

Thanks a lot for any assistance you can give me!! </TEXT>

I ended up swapping the coiled cable on my Senn HD280s with just a female 3.5 up top, and I love that so far. Definitely get the grief with the locked 2.5 on the 598s though - I wish I could swap cables with the 280s.  </TEXT>

Old 3DS 11.2

I'm on the "Section IV - Restoring the System" part of the guide. SysNAND Restore tells me there are no usable files found. I definitely see NANDmin in /files9/, and I tried using a backup copy that I had on my computer, but it's not seeing it. Do I have any options here?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Old 3DS 11.2

So I've completed most of the guide up until 2xrsa - I carefully put all the files I needed on the SD card, launched web browser on the 3ds, put in the URL, hit enter, got a message that it was loading a .bin, then nothing. Screen froze. 

Gave it a few minutes, got nothing, restarted, tried wiping browser data as the guide suggests, same thing. 

Popped out the SD. Checked the arm9.bin and arm11.bin files, put SD back into 3ds, now it won't boot with the SD card in. I guess this would be easier if I knew more about what this exploit was doing...

Any advice? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cheapest one at the hardware store is a good place to get started. It will be one temperature heated rod with no features and might die after a few years, but for $5.95, who cares. If you find you are interested, you can spend 30-60 on a solder station, which has a power switch, temp control, an iron holder and a cleaning sponge. 

There isn't much past that - even daily solderers just use something like that usually. 

I have a weller brand station that suits me just fine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nice. Clark is a good place for psych. Undergrad psych is what most people go for there, myself included. The real value is in the free masters degree (fifth year) that you are eligible for if you have a good gpa. Psych is usually how people end up at Clark, but most people end up declaring a different major by junior year. The psych program is kind of dull during undergrad, but if you stick it out until fifth year, you get a great education. 

I also love Worcester - best food town in the northeast. And if you have any niche interests, there's a lot going on if you know where to look. 

If you end up with other questions, don't hesitate to ask! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the same as any inner city school for the most part. I know people who were mugged, but that will happen in Boston or Providence just the same. Honestly, on the couple of blocks campus encompasses, it's very safe. At night it can be good to walk with a buddy/group. Nobody ever messed with me, but I'm a ~200lb guy. There's cheap housing nearby, but the surrounding neighborhoods can be sketchy. $300 a month for rent, but people break into cars occasionally. On campus is fine though. 

Edit: congrats on your acceptance though! Any idea what you want to study? </TEXT>

<TEXT> For cocktails, the Still and Stir is kind of expensive, but they'll make you almost anything. For "girly colorful drinks", I mean, check out most restaurants that have liquor licenses? I personally go to Nick's on Milbury street, and they'll make you fun drinks without grumbling if it's not busy. Best bartenders in the city (as far as being great guys). Armsby Abbey is pricy but has an amazing cocktail menu, though they don't generally stray from it. If you want shitty colored drinks, curacao/midori/etc, check out some of the sports bars on Green St.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted this on the last thread, but I have more information this time:

I have a pair of Sennheiser HD280 Pro 64 headphones that I'm trying to use with my computer. I have been experiencing some static in the right ear, and have been completely unable to fix it. I use a Sound Blaster Omni USB amp/dac thing.

Initially I connected the headphones right to the back of the case, but my motherboard audio jack started to fail. I tried the case-front jack, that one gives me coil whine. Bought the dac and it mostly fixed the issue, but now I was just getting a slight static.

I went so far as to replace the coiled cable on the headphones with a straight one, and I still have the same problem. Is this something to do with the higher impedance? Or an improperly grounded outlet? I think this happened in my last apartment too, so a bad power supply even? Help?

**Update** - I grabbed a pair of Senn HD598CS for $99 on black Friday, and they are exhibiting the same symptoms, but these are 23, which is a lot more average. 

Also tested Bose QuietComfort 15 (73), those have NO static. 

Tried disconnecting powered speakers from the Omni, maybe the static got quieter? Hard to say for sure. Maybe I need a ground loop isolator? 

Any insight is hyper appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a pair of Sennheiser HD280 Pro 64 headphones that I'm trying to use with my computer. I have been experiencing some static in the right ear, and have been completely unable to fix it. I use a Sound Blaster Omni USB amp/dac thing.

Initially I connected the headphones right to the back of the case, but my motherboard audio jack started to fail. I tried the case-front jack, that one gives me coil whine. Bought the dac and it mostly fixed the issue, but now I was just getting a slight static.

I went so far as to replace the coiled cable on the headphones with a straight one, and I still have the same problem. Is this something to do with the higher impedance? Or an improperly grounded outlet? I think this happened in my last apartment too, so a bad power supply even? Help? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So for a long time I have really wanted to make an extension to handle downloading of larger files. As of now, I save URLs to a .txt file and run a batch script which is basically just "wget -r -np -c -i Auto.txt". 

I think the next step is to set up an extension that can load URLs into that txt file straight from context menu in chrome. 

Problem is, I have never really done anything like this before. Does anyone have ideas or tutorials to share? I don't really know where to start, but I'm a fast learner! </TEXT>

Don't boil. Let sit overnight. Strain through cheesecloth (twice if necessary). Add some vodka or brandy or whatever you want.

<TEXT> Right now there's a hard cap on charter schools. For example say Springfield has two. Under 100 in the state. 

They split budget with public schools. Springfield's total budget for education gets split 80%/10%/10%. The public schools have to share funding with charter schools. 

The charter schools both only enroll 200 students (part through lottery and par through legacy). These students may get an excellent education, or they may get a horrible one. We don't really regulate that. 

Yes on question 2 lets the state start 12 new schools every year with no limit. So we could see Springfield public school budget dropping gradually, lowering public school effectiveness (further than it already is). 

Basically, Massachusetts has the best schools in the country. We need more money for public schooling, especially in cities. Dividing it more between charters we don't regulate hurts, it doesn't help. 

Mind, all of these numbers are purely made up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was actually 3.5, but I made a totemist who was terrified of heights. Now this is not a rare flaw, but it led to a sticky situation. 

The sorcerer and I broke into a room by using blink from the floor below. We were now on the 5th floor of the building. Our rogue climbed out the window of the adjacent room and shimmied along the ledge. 

A guard finds us. Rogue climbs out window quickly. Guard trains crossbow on me and sorcerer. Sorcerer has 10 HP. Tried to ready spell. Guard fires, drops sorcerer to -2HP. 

Now I'm alone with the unconscious friend. Can't bring her out window and walk on ledge because fuck that. 

Throw sorcerer our windows and blink 10ft downward.

Crit fail reflex save to catch.

Splat. 

Edit:  Blink, not dimension door.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They come with a little magnet with adhesive. The mic has a magnet on it as well. It's nice, and there are multiple positions for it. I actually use mine with a set of 280 pros, but I have three other sets of headphones with the little magnets on them, so I can switch around. Only downside is that you have two cables, and the long skinny modmic cable really doesn't tie to the coiled 280 cable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry, I meant vit. The more you have, the less AR you get. It's 50 max AR at 60 MAX equip load. It goes down 1 AR for each .5 max equip load you have. So if your load is 10/**100** you still get 0 AR. You need to cap your vit at 14 (or 9 if you use third dragon ring) to get the full 50 AR. Ring of blades +2 gives a flat 50 AR but it's hard to get.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Flynn's won't help you if you have 30 endurance. Blades +1/+2 is good, but I'd skip the rest of those. Soldiers ring, dragon rings, cloranthy ring, yorgh ring, dispelling ring +1 are all good. Might be good to raise vigor and lower vitality. Royal greatsword is good but not amazing. Try taking a faster weapon and just see how it feels. I know it will take longer, but you won't have so many recovery frames, so you can dance around him more. 

Best of luck, and don't go hollow!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can I do this with a raspberry pi? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-22 13:27:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have a B+ at home that I've messed around with a fair bit, but I was wondering if I can use it as a standalone download machine. 

Generally my desktop computer is running almost 24/7 doing wget downloads of random directories, and I remote into it from work via Chrome Remote Desktop. If I set up the rpi with SSH (something I never figured out), is it reasonable to connect storage and run the pi 24/7 downloading crap? Would I see a speed drop? Would an rpi zero work? Can I power a sata drive and connect with a usb adapter for storage? Would NAS slow down the process? I have so many questions and not enough tech oriented friends to ask. 

Any help is greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I'm never buying Bose again. I worked for their customer service for two years, but they just laid off that entire wing of the company (lots of us were contract too, so no severance) and sent the jobs to Manila. Following this they have stopped offering exchanges on home theater systems. 

So there's a good chance that when you lose audio in your left ear on the QC35s (common issue) you will be up shit creek.  </TEXT>

I fell on top of my Nintendo 2DS yesterday, crushing the screen(s). The unit will not power on anymore (blue light on for a second, then off). I am able to replace the screen fairly easily, but I'm not sure if it is worthwhile. Would a broken screen cause the system to lock up like that? The main PCB looks fine - I'm just trying to save $35 if the screen isn't going to do anything. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Interesting MPG issue! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-01 16:27:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So at work I run the local television stations. One of them is a movie channel, and the schedule for what movies I play is made elsewhere. September's schedule says I need to play a movie on Saturday that I don't have! My DVD of the movie won't rip because it's encrypted I think (multiple .VOB files?) so I'm looking for another option. I managed to get a .mkv version from a friend, but my TV software (Leightronix WinLGX 7) only seems to accept .MPG. 

As far as I understand, MPEG4 should work, but I only know how to convert with a container, a la handbrake. Can someone explain how best to make LGX recognize this file?

EDIT: This is gross. We need to upgrade.

<TEXT> Cards have other Pokemon on the back, for instance, the Eggsecute card has Horsea on the other side with the same background color and holofoil style. They belong to a friend, but I was curious so I've been doing some research. They somewhat resemble the 1997 Pokemon Carddass line, but don't have "POCKET MONSTERS" in bold at the bottom. That being said, the Japanese on them reads "Pocket Monsters Board Game" which may possibly lead to [this game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1381/pokemon-master-trainer/credits), but I can't find detailed pictures. 

Edit: Nevermind on that board game, german version doesn't have those cards, assuming this is some other promo item.  </TEXT>

It looks like the existing Japanese CTU ( Tokushu Sakusen Gun) pretty commonly uses the [HK416](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/HK416.jpg/300px-HK416.jpg), the [FN SCAR](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/ARMS_%26_Hunting_2010_exhibition_%28331-26%29.jpg/250px-ARMS_%26_Hunting_2010_exhibition_%28331-26%29.jpg), the [Minebea PM-9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/9mm%E6%A9%9F%E9%96%A2%E6%8B%B3%E9%8A%83_%288464077981%29.jpg/300px-9mm%E6%A9%9F%E9%96%A2%E6%8B%B3%E9%8A%83_%288464077981%29.jpg), the [Remington M24](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/PEO_M24_SWS.jpg/300px-PEO_M24_SWS.jpg), and the [HK USP](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/HKUSP.png/300px-HKUSP.png).

Personally I'm expecting a FLIR scope? Maybe some way to make kill holes in reinforced walls? A climbing character? What about a bouncing betty gadget? 

As long as it's not overly weeaboo, what are your ideas or thoughts on the next round of operators?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's tough. Prices should start to drop soon hopefully as the original cast pretty much split. You can enter the lottery if you live within an hour or two of NYC - if you win (very low chances) you get 2 front row tickets for $10 each (but you need to get there in time). Other than that, get a lot of money. I think PBS is airing a recording of original cast on like October 9th or so. That's gonna be cool, and accessible to us normies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Got it. I actually desoldered the cap I thought was at fault, but it turns out the leaking I thought I was seeing was elsewhere on the board, as the cap tested fine on its own. 

Basically my work was scrapping an $800 Samsung tv that isn't going out of standby, and I started my job last week so I'm trying to impress them. Figured it was worth checking with a dmm. 

I actually have a cheap Westinghouse tv at home that's doing the same thing, and no solution for that either. 

Do you think it's worth buying replacement caps for both psu's? Or does it make more sense to just order replacement boards from China? 50-60 for each one

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Backstory: trying to fix a dead tv at work.

Should a dmm on a capacitor always approach infinite resistance? Like a cap that goes up to 600k (instead of going to 1.0 on the meter) is passing current even though it's full, right? That's bad. Right?

I can't find any bad caps on the power supply board, but one of them doesn't seem to charge and discharge properly. It's a 47uF 50V cap, so I should be able to replace it easily, but I'm not sure is this is the problem or not. 

Any help is appreciated! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Idea for a new gadget (maybe to replace some redundant Nitro?) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-02 06:50:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ok, so in Rainbow Six Vegas (and RSV2) you had an optional  gadget called a motion sensor. It was a little doodad you stuck on a wall, and it emitted a laser beam. If an enemy walked through this beam, you got a ping on your map showing where they were. 

This could be integrated into RS6S pretty easily as a defense gadget, and it would be nice to have fewer C4 ops. Instead of showing a ping on a map, it could show on your compass, sort of like how a friendly ping does, or possibly as a tag (as per drone/camera tagging). 

Keep in mind, we now a ton of Nitro Cell ops: Smoke, Mute, Pulse, Kapkan, Bandit, Valkyrie, Caveira (+Frost before patch). Anyone else sick of it? It doesn't feel unique to defenders anymore, and it is frustrating how shield operators just don't feel worth it anymore. In fact, there are more C4 defense ops than non-C4 defense ops. 

Other gadgets just don't feel as meaningful. It would be awesome if you had a nice surveillance tool that wasn't quite as powerful as Valk's cams. 

Any thoughts?  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-06-30 02:30:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My friend has been talking about building a computer with a budget around 1200. I've built a few computers before, but he doesn't seem super interesting in learning HOW to pick out parts. Thing is, I'm not confident enough with today's hardware to set up a list for him. He just purchased a Zotac GTX 1070, as he's been watching for them to get in stock, and his attitude now is "Now what?"

I'm trying to get him to look at ATX cases he likes, LGA1151 DDR4 compatible mobos, etc. His other friend says he should build for 2k. I'm really not sure what kind of price hit this means in terms of monitor, or processing needs for CPU. 

Any advice? </TEXT>

My friend is looking for something to game on. I may have finally convinced him not to buy a gaming laptop. He's super new to the process, so I feel like I'm baffling him with things like DDR3 vs DDR4, CPU socket types, etc. I want to figure out a good base i5 6600+ build for him to work off of. He's super interested in the new GPUs coming out, so I figured we would wait a month or so and see what options we have. I don't know if he can spring for a 1070, but we'll see what the rest of the build comes out to. I threw in an SSD, because he's not like me; he doesn't find reinstalling an OS to be a fun daytime activity. I want to stick with an IPS display, case isn't listed because he'll want to pick one out online (or I might drag him to Microcenter). Does anyone have input?

<TEXT> Bought this guy on black friday 2014. Honestly, it's probably exceeded expectations so far - a $200 trash tv should have died sooner. Basically for the last six months or so I've had to power cycle the tv multiple times to get it to power on (it's probably been power cycled over 1,000 times at this point). I'm not sure if it's the tv or the outlets in my house (either I'm getting 82VAC on all my outlets or my meter is broken). At this point it just won't turn on at all. I still get a red standby led, but can't get it to power. I finally caved and popped the shell off to look for distended caps or broken solder. No luck so far. Any thoughts?

<TEXT> I was thinking... It seems like most of us use wget to hoard massive amounts of data. Personally, I tend to use "-wget -r -np -i Queue.txt", and leave a text document with my download links in the directory. 

I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts about a Chrome extension that would add "Add to queue" to the context menu in Chrome (or Firefox, or whatever). It would save a lot of copy paste, and it seems like a very easy app to build. I have little experience in this field, so any recommendations would be super helpful. </TEXT>

I'm connected with a powerline adapter to a Netgear R7000 (which is in the DMZ of my ISP router, Actiontec mi424wr). UPnP is enabled, PS4 is DMZ'd on the R7000, static IP is set for PS4.

Not sure what is causing this, or what has changed. Does anyone have any ideas?

As I'm posting, I realize now it seems to be getting worse. Now I get error WS-37397-9 when trying to Connect to PSN. The step right before NAT test. Is my network adapter failing or something? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As the title suggests, our fire alarms keep going off in the middle of the night. We have 8 Kidde k12040 alarms on 120v and one on battery only. The battery one goes off at the same time as the others, and they start at the same time. I checked some of the ac connections and standard outlets, and it seems like we're getting just 85v in all our receptacles... Weird. I guess this could cause the ac units to go off, but why is the battery alarm going off too? It seems unlikely that the ones in the downstairs kitchen and hallway would go off at the same time as the ones behind closed doors upstairs. Any have a idea? Electrician will be along soon, but the holiday might slow him down </TEXT>

<TITLE> Westinghouse DWM40F3G1 power issue </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-10 04:35:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I bought a cheap tv last year on black Friday. 40" for $200 seemed reasonable. That being said, after about seven months, the tv stopped turning on. It stays stuck in standby mode. I end up having to reset it between one and fifty times before it will turn on and stay on without problems. I talked to Westinghouse, and their customer service is awful - it would cost more than $100 to fix, and they seem to have decided I don't have a warranty. 
I'm pretty good at repairs for the most part, but I've never worked on a tv before. Does anyone have an idea of where I should start? Or is there like a good irc channel for electronic repairs? Any help is greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

I just bought a new mouse, keyboard, and external sound card (I like having it external ;D) - [Logitech Hyperion Fury](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g402-hyperion-fury-fps-gaming-mouse), [Corsair K70 RGB Brown Switch](http://www.corsair.com/en-us/corsair-gaming-k70-rgb-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-cherry-mx-brown), [Creative Sound Blaster Omni Surround 5.1](http://us.creative.com/p/sound-blaster/sound-blaster-omni-surround-5-1). I'm thinking about new monitors, but my desk fits mine perfectly for now, and that might come later. Otherwise, I was looking at different mobos and possibly a nice cpu cooler. Do you have any recommendations for upgrades?

<TITLE> Help with trash Vaio </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-30 20:46:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys. I found a Vaio in the trash outside of an apartment yesterday. It's a Vaio VPCSA-113T. It seems like a Chinese graduate student tossed it when they went home. It was in a bag with a charger, and seems to be in pretty good condition. However, it will not turn on. I've taken it apart and it doesn't seem to have any damage (blown caps, water damage). I tested the hard drive, and it's working fine. 
The thing that strikes me as odd is the dc jack. It's the usual pin-tube-thing, but the female side of it has two pins instead of the usual doughnut shape. Is this damage? Or is this a difference in Chinese models? (The ac plug is Chinese and requires an adapter)
The adapter is I-100-240V AC 1.5A 50-60Hz ///O-19.5V DC 4.7A. 
Thoughts? Is this fix as hard as buying a new DC jack? Or did I just find myself a brick with a free 750GB hard drive in it? </TEXT>

I joined a pool, got my wallet set up (checked with faucet) and have a CPU miner running. Not sure what to expect. I read a tutorial that said "expect a few hundred a day" or something. I checked my pool's "Blocks" tab and it says blocks are only found on the 1st of the month. Can someone explain? Also free doge are always welcome. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help with my hives? Doctors seem baffled </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey, I'm a 24 year old male, and I've been bothered by some sort of chronic urticaria for 365 days tomorrow. I have spent the last year breaking out into hives, which are absolutely miserably itchy. When I scratch them, they just itch more, hurt and get worse. I have had them on the back of my scalp every single day since last December, and they spread most often to points of friction (waistline, armpits, elbows, chin) and often my face and hand swell up from them. On rare occasions, my esophagus seems to swell, and I have trouble swallowing (never any difficulty breathing). I have been to my primary care physician, a secondary physician and an allergist. Between the three, I have been told to try to cut out allergens, take nasal steroids year round and "learn to live with it". I'm very frustrated with these answers, and I refuse to believe that I am going to be scratching until I bleed for the rest of my life. I have tried zyrtec, benadryll, fluticasone and prednisone, where the only thing that was effective was the prednisone. Does anyone have a recommendation? I'm seeking a referral to a dermo from my primary next week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, so I'm trying to create a server (1.6.4) that uses BOP, but every time I try to run the client, it creates a folder called 1.6.4 in the mods folder, containing a JAR called "WorldCore-universal-1.6.4-1.1.0.17". Minecraft crashes shortly after the Mojang screen. I know that BOP is SMP, so I figure there's a way to make it work, but I don't really know where to start. I am using Forge 1.6.4.

Thanks a lot! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dual monitor setup not working with 8.1? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-18 17:21:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I figured I would update last night, and upon waking this morning (slow download servers), I found that not only was my GPU driver outdated, and my CCC wouldn't run, I could not use my second monitor. I fixed the GPU issue, but the multiple display issue baffles me. The OS treats it as if it's connected, but the monitor itself won't leave sleep mode. I can set it as my primary display, and this lets me move the mouse into the space it is supposed to occupy, but I still get no picture. I've tried setting it to Duplicate/Extend, etc, and gotten nothing. It's an ~17" old Dell flatscreen from like 2008. My primary is a very new 23". I figured maybe Win8.1 changed the signal sent to secondary monitors, but that just wouldn't make sense. Has anyone else had this issue? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You will be able to make out shapes better at the edges of your vision. 
I believe this has something to do with cones being concentrated in the center of your eye so you can see color better when focusing, and rods on the outsides so you can identify objects in your periphery to focus on.

Anyway, this trick is extremely useful when trying to find your way back from the bathroom at night. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So occasionally I try to listen to music while going to sleep, and have it turned way down. My new build however, tends to begin processing loudly (i5 3570K) and it is about as loud as the music. The processing sound itself isn't the problem though, I can't find out what it is that is eating processing power while the system is idle. It's definitely the Windows 8 Action Center, but it's not telling me what the problem is. Here's a shot of the system monitor and system tray.
Thoughts?

<TITLE> Windows won't boot. HDD? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have a slightly older laptop that has just recently stopped booting XP. I have done everything I can think of to fix it with zero success. First I tried getting it into Safe Mode, but I can't get anything after the BIOS splash. My next attempt was to connect the notebook's HDD to the SATA port on my desktop. This worked, but I did not have read permission to access My Documents, and most of the files I need are in there. I did a chkdsk /r, but it did not help. My hope at this point is to just clone the drive onto a spare I have (assuming the notebook HDD is damaged/wearing out.)

Notebook is Vostro 1500 XP (WD250GB)
Desktop is custom Win8 preview
Extra notebook SATA WD320GB

Thanks in advance for any help you can give!

<TITLE> Trying to use Notebook as wireless adapter. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So as the title says, I have a new desktop(8 preview) without a wireless adapter, and I've seen it said that I can use my notebook (xp) as one. I've tried messing with network bridges and network sharing, but I can't seem to find the right configuration. When I bridge the networks and connect the computers via LAN, my notebook just says that I am "Not Connected" to the network, and refuses to connect to anything. No matter what I do, the desktop displays "Unidentified Network, No Internet Access."

Is what I'm trying to do really possible?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I just built a new computer. I unfortunately did not budget for a new monitor, and I'm having a lot of trouble using my old one. 

Build:
* ASRock Z77 Extreme4 * 8GB Ripjaw Memory * 1TB WD HDD * GIGABYTE GV-R787OC-2GD Radeon HD 7870 GPU * Intel i5-3570 (Stock heatsink for now) * Rosewill Redbone Case * Antec 520W PSU * Ubuntu

So my old monitor is a Dell LCD from about 7 years ago. It only has a VGA connector, so I need to plug it into my mobo, as my gpu does not have a VGA plug. The problem is that the computer seems to default to the GPU HDMI port, as when the GPU is connected, I don't even get to see my BIOS screen. I would like to be able to use the GPU I purchased, but I can't find a way to do it. 
I previously tried changing the BIOS to use the onboard GPU as a default display, and it works fine, but if I plug in my GPU, I get errors telling me it won't work if it's not primary.

Thanks for any help you can give! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, so I just built myself a new desktop, and it's great. The big problem is that I don't have a wireless adapter for it as of now, and I don't have the extra cash to get one any time soon.
As far as I know, I should be able to connect the desktop to the internet with a network bridge and the wifi card in my laptop.
I set up the bridge on my laptop though (Vostro 1500, XP), and while my desktop (running ubuntu) seems to see me plugging it into the laptop, it doesn't seem to be able to find a connection.
Any help is greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-09-10 23:09:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So this is kind of a long story, but I am looking for a good way to get a Windows variant on my new desktop. I just spent the summer building it, but did not remember to budget for an OS.
The build is as follows:
* ASRock Z77 Extreme4
* 8GB Ripjaw Memory
* 1TB WD HDD
* GIGABYTE GV-R787OC-2GD Radeon HD 7870 GPU
* Intel i5-3570 (Stock heatsink for now)
* Rosewill Redbone Case
* Antec 520W PSU

I also ripped apart an old HP Notebook and put the 320GB HDD in there, which still has Vista on it.
So now I can boot from the 320GB HDD and run Vista, but it's ridiculously slow. I was thinking of just running a Windows Repair CD, but the fun part is I did not spring for an optical drive. I know this can be done by USB, but I didn't want to commit to it if it isn't going to work. 

So my question is: Can I use a USB Repair Disk to fix Vista? Additionally, I was wondering if I could move Windows to the 1TB HDD without my serial key.

Thanks a ton for any help you can provide! </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Build Help] Gaming Machine, Looking For Assistance </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-23 23:24:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So this is going to be my first build, and the result of working four jobs this summer. I'm going for a mid-budget ($750-$1250) gaming, photoshop, media, etc rig. Hopefully keeping it on the lower end of the budget range, but I can be convinced. 
So far I've only purchased the case and power supply, as I figured those would be the hardest to mess up. I bought the 
[Rosewill REDBONE](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811147159) Mid Tower
and an [Antec NEO ECO 520W](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371030) PSU.

Right now I am considering my Mobo, GPU and CPU.
I found a nice deal on Newegg where I can get the [MSI 990FXA-GD80V2 and the AMD FX-8120 Zambezi 3.1GHz](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.1026665).
Conveniently enough, the deal also comes with [Team Xtreem Dark Series 8GB](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820313080) free. Even if it's not the best reviewed memory out there, it's free.
I guess what I want to know is whether or not this is a good looking deal, and what to consider for GPUs.
Any help is greatly, greatly appreciated.
Thanks! </TEXT>

Here's the build I've just come up with. I should preface with the fact that I have absolutely no skill or experience at building computers. I am however, very good at building everything else (and taking computers apart), so I am not worried about assembly or anything, just things like bottlenecking. Could someone take the time to look through this build and tell me if everything there is necessary, or at least a good idea? I have spent a few hours doing research, and I'm finally confident enough to post a list, but I really wanted to budget this around $700. All help is extremely appreciated!

EDIT: I live very close to a Microcenter, but I haven't been giving them my custom based on some terrible repair jobs. Would they have any of these parts at better prices? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the past few days, my computer has been having trouble with processing things that, a week ago would have caused no problems. Mainly, this is evident when I try to play a game. Games that would run at 25+ fps a week ago, now run consistently at 5-9 fps. I see the problem in web-browsing and file transfers as well.

The weird thing is, once in a while, everything runs smoothly. I'm not sure what that means, but it never lasts long. 

I am running XP SP3 on a Dell Vostro 1500 (I know, it's a piece of garbage), ESET NOD32 Smart Security and occasionally Adaware. I also use CCleaner very regularly. I've tried a few things: safe-mode deep scanning, defragging, uninstalling unused programs, etc. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I figure my graphics card might be the problem, but I don't honestly know how to fix something like that short of buying a new one.

Thanks for your help! </TEXT>

I don't mean necessarily that the game is unapproachable, I just mean that as someone who started playing the game four months late, I find I'm rage quitting a lot. 
I know what I'm supposed to be doing, and I know (theoretically) how to do it, I just get stuck somewhere along the way. 
Does anyone else have a history of this? Does anyone want to play a bit online? (I promise I'm not useless) Any tips would be welcome. Thanks! </TEXT>
