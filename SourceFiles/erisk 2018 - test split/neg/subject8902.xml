The Trump team requested:

"Can you send us some pictures of the military vehicles we could add to the parade?" 

They were definitely asking about it. And if you read full context of the email, the author says

...before we provide pictures which might be considered binding."

Had they responded by providing the photos they would have found themselves "bound" by them. That's a denied request.

Hey guys. My friend and I started a movie podcast about 6 months ago. We bill ourselves as the only podcast where two guys with speech impediments talk about movies. We like to take one movie and review it in depth. Our episodes generally last around 20-30 minutes. Our most recent episode was on The Lego Movie, the surprise animated hit of 2014. We discuss what made the literal giant Lego commercial such a good film and so enjoyable. We also discuss our thoughts on all the coming spin-off films. It'd be awesome if you took the time to listen and subscribe.

<TEXT> We've been under staffed in the automotive center a while, and associates have been complaining. A few techs have went to management and were told to if they weren't happy with the way things were to suck it up or quit. 

I'm the sporting goods manager, but I was a tech, so I'm one of the few people in the store actually certified, and I'm always getting pulled out there to help due to the staffing issues. When this happens it makes it where I can't get my own tasks done and management always have things to say about that. 

It came to a head the other day when one of the techs quit, and now I was forced to change my schedule and come in Sunday to work out there literally all day, from 8-6, the entire time our automotive center is open. And there's only 2 of us out there all day, so it will screw us when we have to take lunches. 

Does this kind of shit happen at other stores? </TEXT>

I see the way asst managers get treated at my store. Working 20 hour days around the holidays while working 6 days a week. And getting berated by the store manager and market manager. Yeah, the additional pay would be nice, but it's just not worth it to me at the moment. Maybe when I have a child and the additional income is more necessary. </TEXT>

Columbus didn't even do what it is we celebrate him for. Our continent had been discovered by the vikings centuries before Columbus was born, and there's the fact that Columbus committed atrocities as bad as anyone throughout history. He maimed and tortured the people that were on the continent first, sold them into slavery and raped the women. He is definitely not a man worthy of admiration, and he is definitely not worthy of a national holiday. </TEXT>
