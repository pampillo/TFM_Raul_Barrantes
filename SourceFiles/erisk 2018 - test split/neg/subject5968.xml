<TEXT> I think I need to lead off this post with a request for advice.

Do any of you redditors know of decent orthopaedic surgeons in the Northwestern Arkansas area? 
I may be in need of some strenuous medical attention in the near future. 

That said, I'd like to tell you all about what happened to me last night in my bathtub. 

First off, let me make a few things clear:

1) I'm a 25-year-old male in fairly decent physical shape; ex-military, love to work out, play hockey in my free time, love being outside in my yard, etc.

2) I'm married to a wonderful woman who I don't deserve. Also, she's hella into beauty/skin products and I secretly LOVE using them for myself. Most guys don't tend to put much effort into maintaining healthy skin and that sort of thing, but some of these products my wife uses...man, they're just awesome. Treat yo'self, am I right?

3) I freakin' love taking baths. 

All right, so recently I've taken to drawing up late night baths when I can't sleep. I like to turn the hot water on full blast, just about to the point of actually scalding myself, wait a few minutes for it to cool slightly, and then get in and close my eyes and drift. 

The hot water makes my pulse race and I usually start to sweat pretty good until I acclimate to the temperature. At that point I'm fully relaxed and I begin to revel in the feeling of my body just fully "letting go". 

After about a half hour in the tub, I hop out, dry off, and promptly knock out in an excellently deep sleep. 

I love it. 

But, for whatever reason, I wanted more. 

I wanted *full* relaxation. A sense of completely losing myself in the water, drifting into just a state of consciousness with no relative reference to my physical being. 

Weird, I know. 

With that desire in mind, last night I decided to try something I'd heard of in a television series: Sensory Deprivation. 

The idea being that I could manufacture a state of somewhat transcendent consciousness by depriving my sense of sight, touch, and hearing anything to latch onto. 

So, I put blackout curtains on the bathroom windows, pinned another to the ceiling next to the little alcove where the bathtub sits recessed into the wall, and stuffed black towels under the gap between the bathroom door and the tile floor. 

I ran the water hot until the steam felt like a palpable thing hanging in the still air of my small bathroom. I waited a bit for it to cool, so as not to broil myself in my homemade sauna, and then I stepped in. 

I sat down and leaned back against the cool wall of the tub recess, closed my eyes, and focused on breathing and letting my body totally relax. 

After a few minutes, I opened my eyes.

My idea had worked. 

It was so dark in the bathroom that I could not tell the difference between sitting there with my eyes closed or with them open. 

I should say also that there are no vents in my bathroom save for what I like to call the "fart fan" that turns on when you flip the light switch. 

The air was still, warm, and silent, and I began to pick up on sounds my mind usually filtered out.

The sound of blood whispering through the vessels in my body...

Water rippling against the sides of the tub... 

Someone breathing....

Wait. 

What?

At the exact moment my brain processed that there was an extra set of lungs breathing somewhere near me, a rush of chill air ruffled the curtains I'd hung up around the tub, and the water in which I sat went from being near-scalding hot to feeling as though someone had dumped buckets of ice into it. 

And my fucking phone lit up. 

I'd stupidly brought it into the bathroom with me, and it was sitting tucked between the blackout curtain and the shower liner, probably propped against the outside of the tub. 

And there she was. 

Sitting cross-legged and facing me on the other end of the tub was a woman, beautiful, nude, and very much terrifying. 

Her skin shone briefly in the pale light from my phone screen. It was like alabaster, gleaming in the steam from the sauna-like conditions I'd created in the bathroom. 

Her hair was pulled slightly up in a messy bun, with locks falling to either side of her face, and her bangs tucked untidily behind one ear. 

Her breasts were large, full, perfectly shaped, and her shoulders and neck spoke to a petite, but firm build. 

In essence, she was gorgeous. 

She also had no eyes. 

In the quick glance I had at her as the light from my phone faded away, I could have been mistaken, could have been tricked by the light and my sudden surprise, but it seemed to me that her eyes were hollow, black pits, shadowed and menacing. 

Beauty and terror, all in one, and right there in the tub with me. 

The change in temperature shocked me, took my breath away, and I felt everything shrivel. 

Yes, even that. 

I had the utmost sense of urgency that I should begin to attempt to make myself as small as possible, shrink away as much as I could from the terror sitting a foot from me on the other side of the tub. 

I pulled my knees into my chest, tucked my chin, and tried to become the smallest ball of person I could manage. 

Cold hands gripped my ankles as I tried to tuck my feet in closer to my curled up body. 

Slender, spindly fingers encircled my lower legs and pulled me back into a sitting position with my legs and feet extended in front of me. 

Ragged breathing, raspy and wet, accompanied the strong pull of hands I could not see, but could most definitely feel. 

The light from my phone had faded completely by now, and I was once again drifting without sight in the manufactured darkness with which I had recently been so satisfied. 

Long fingers worked their way up the insides of my legs, up my calves, slowly, but firmly. 

I was afraid of being touched...*there*...but the hands lingered around the angle behind my knees.

And then they squeezed. 

Have you ever been in such pain that you literally could not scream? Could not even exhale, much less vocalize your agony?

The pain of those fingers sinking into the tender flesh behind my knees was such that my breath caught in my chest and I felt the strongest sense that my lungs would burst before I could even cry out in fear and pain. 

The fingers in my right knee worked their way in between sinew, tendon, and bone. I could feel the bones of that awful hand grinding against the ones in my knee. 

I felt something snap, pop, and burn in the inner workings of my knee, and the hand released, withdrew, disappeared.

Someone had set my leg on fire from my knee down to my toes, and I began to sob in earnest.

I cried and cried and bit into my cheek to stop myself from screaming out like a dying animal. 

The temperature in the tub resumed its previously warm state, and I felt a noticeable heaviness in the air sweeping away from the bath. 

I was still in great pain, so much so that, had I been able to see, I'm sure my vision would have been swimming and I probably would have passed out. 

As it was, in the complete dark my eyes were no longer my brain's grip on reality and instead I was given the gift of unbridled, searing agony to hold onto as I scrabbled to lift myself up and out of the tub without putting any weight on my screaming knee. 

I shoved the curtains aside, yanking part of it from the ceiling in my violent struggle to get out of that terrifying water. 

I found the light switch and flipped it, the sound of the fan whirring to life and bright light from above the sink temporarily blinding me, as my visual receptors remembered how to see again. 

I crumpled to the floor beside the tub, holding my knee as it throbbed and shot pure fire through my leg. 

I was still biting my cheek, and I could feel warm blood starting to pool in my mouth as I lay on my side trying not to scream. 

It was hours before the pain subsided enough that I was able to pull myself somewhat vertical, open the bathroom door, and crawl out into the cool air of my house. 

My wife was in our bedroom, sleeping soundly, unaware of and unperturbed by the painful ordeal I'd just been through. 

I crawled to the couch, leg still aflame, hoisted myself onto it, and fell into a fitful sleep, where I dreamed of hollow eyes and long fingers in the dark.

Yesterday I woke up, wrapped my knee up in an ACE bandage and drove myself to the hospital. 

MRI's and X-Ray films show that my ACL is fully ruptured in my right knee; how I was able to even stand up in order to hobble into the ER was beyond the doctor who was seeing to my treatment. 

I don't have any compromising skeletal damage, but the X-Ray showed what looked like large, long gouges down a portion of my tibia and the resulting muscular trauma has left me with an angry purple bruise that starts behind my knee and extends halfway down my calf. 

The ER doc set me up with this awesome leg-immobilizing brace and Percocet. 

I'm in between doses of painkiller right now, so I'm trying to bang this account out before my knee goes back to screaming at me. 

Like I said before, if anyone knows a good orthopaedic surgeon in NW Arkansas, holler at me. 

Also, what the *fuck* happened to me last night? </TEXT>

<TEXT> can confirm now that Grabacr shoots Bartlett and Pops.

I started hauling ass away from Schwarze and inadvertently found myself on the southeastern edge of the map where Bernitz was firing at both the MiG and Tomcat. 

I locked the Sukhoi up with an MPBM and fired. 

I got the "Hold Fire" message as I watched all three of them disappear. 

Guess I fouled up the canonical sequence, because I (Cipher) definitely smoked all three of those guys at once.

<TEXT> Curious as to whether or not anyone has ever managed to capture in-game footage of Bartlett getting hit over B7R during the hairball. 

I've definitely seen him in amongst the allied units, but have always been to busy to focus on him for more than a few seconds. It'd be neat if B/N actually took the time to depict him getting hit during the battle. 

Obviously Buchner is Cipher's kill (along with Schwarze) so I've definitely watched that one go down. 

Post a link or description if you've ever watched Bartlett get shot! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Salvia 60x report </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-10 18:36:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is an almost instant report of what salvia 60x did to me.
Everything I type is as I remember it. 

I'm currently coming back from wherever this stuff took me.


I made a trip nest in the bathroom (blankets and pillows piled up in the bathtub),  turned on some calm electronic music, closed the curtain on the bathtub, scorched the bowl, took a single hit and held it for 30 seconds. 

I then became the parking lot of a small convenience store. 


I was aware that I was also a set of curtains on a window looking UP at the parking lot. 


I wanted to get up but the person (not actually there) in the room with me would not give me permission to get up.
I tried two more times to get up at which point I became aware that the person had put pokey sticks in the curtains with me and they were poking me.
Like wood chips or splinters.



I became aware that the curtains were wrapped around me but I was not actually the curtains.

I started to focus more on the parking lot and in doing so realized that someone had put me in a shopping basket and was spinning in circles. 

I realized that I needed to close my eyes, and as I did I put my knees on the side of the tub, the coolness of the tub against my skin became fire-y heat. It dawned on me that I was touching the sides of the shopping basket and that I was trying to hold on and should stop. 

I kept thinking to myself "I'm not allowed to be here. Someone is here with me." over and over and over again.

I had this overwhelming feeling that I was not allowed to be seeing what I was seeing. I did not have permission. 

At that point I started falling UP through the parking lot the curtains and eventually clawed my way back up into my bathtub where I had accidentally kicked the faucet that was now dripping onto my shoes and blanket. 



I said, out loud, "The person here with me will not like this. This is not good." 

At this point I realized that my tongue had a brass weight on top of it.

I was still being poked so I took my sweatshirt off and put it in a drawer. 

I then laid down in my bed with a pillow over my face. 

I pulled the blankets up on top of me at which point I realized that there wasn't actually anything touching me. If I closed my eyes, it became very easy to comprehend that if I couldn't see what was on me, it probably wasn't there at all. 

I had the feeling of someone getting up off of me, a weight being lifted, and I came back. 

The weight on my tongue is gone, and I am sure I am the only one in the house again. 

Thanks for tuning in.

whew.

<TEXT> Oh and I guess I should mention that I felt like everything was about two and a half feet further away from me than it should have been. 
Reaching for things was sort of a task because I'd realize I hadn't reached far enough.
Also, my near vision went absolutely for shit, so I'd be laying on the floor looking at my hands and only seeing blurs. I have 20/20 vision so that was a big "huh..." thing for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe I'm just stupid and inexperienced but I recently got hold of some 50mg vials of IV DPH (high potency) and slammed 300mg in about 4 seconds by injecting it.
I never had the "shadow men" or bugs experience some people have had, never conversed with anyone who wasn't there, and never felt any impending doom.
More than anything, I felt immediately intoxicated; the same feeling I get when I've been drinking a lot, but this time it hit me instantaneously. 
I also felt like someone had nailed me to the floor. So getting up and walking around was really fun because I felt like I was fighting gravity to even move. 
I wouldn't even call it a "trip" just more like being wicked drunk in a record amount of time...that, or maybe like having sustained a head injury or something. I don't know.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> See, I've done IV benadryl in 50mg/ml doses up to like 350mg (so 6 vials) and all that ever happened is this:
 it made my skin get real blotchy, my pupils get huuuuge, I had to pee every 10 minutes, if I sat down I felt like I was nailed to the floor, and anytime I went to reach for something I realized that my reach wasn't long enough. I felt like everything was about two feet farther away from me than it should have been.
I've never had any physiological issues (stomach cramps, nausea) etc from it and honestly it's more like getting wasted in freaking record time than anything else.
Also never seen any shadow men. But I always did it with the lights on.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> was working in a smallish, yet unreasonably busy city as far as 911 system traffic goes. 
Hear the PD radio channel start to buzz about a traffic pursuit that morphed pretty quickly into a foot pursuit when the perp ditched his car on an overpass.
After we heard them exiting their vehicles to go on foot after the guy, my partner and I sort of stopped paying attention.
What we didn't know, though, was that homeboy ditched his car over top of the railroad switching yard and had jumped from the overpass onto a moving set of freight cars. 
Apparently it wasn't like the movies though and he didn't stick the landing; ended up rolling off the side of the car, whereupon his legs got caught under the wheels and so subsequently his left leg was amputated mid thigh. 
Call goes to us since we're sitting point like three miles away from the train yard. 
So we get there and homeboy is still alive so we load and are getting ready to go when my partner is like "shit we need the leg."
I hop out and head back to the car this dude got caught under and sort of squish the leg out from between the wheels. Just kinda grabbed it by the ankle and slung it over my shoulder and headed back to the truck. 
The whole time I'm walking back to the rig, I can feel something smacking me in the center of my back, but I've got to get back fast so we can boogie to the nearest level 1. 
We transfer care, and are cleaning up the truck when my partner spins me around and says, "oh man, we've got to go back to central and let you change. Your shirt is disgusting."
Turns out that slapping feeling in the center of my back was the guy's femoral artery hanging out of the end of the stump; a bloody, gooey, severed garden hose of vasculature just bobbing along back there as I moseyed back to our poor, failed attempted-stuntman criminal patient.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Ringing in My Ears </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-12 04:25:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I remember clearly the first time I went to the doctor for a general health checkup. If memory serves me correctly, I was approximately five years old. There was a vision screening, shots, blood-work, the usual stuff. What I remember most clearly, though, was the hearing exam. You know, the one where you put on the uncomfortable headphones that put pressure on your ears in all the wrong places and then listen to the almost un-hearable little chimes and tones that test your ears sensitivity and hearing quality? 

The box was stuffy; in fact Ive never been in one of those little sound-proof cubicles that wasnt stuffy and oppressive. Ive always felt like I was in trouble when having to sit in one of those cramped boxes. I remember feeling small and alone, probably for the first time really in my life. So much of childhood is spent under someones watchful eye or with a hand grasped firmly by someone much older and more responsible, and now here I was, for all I knew, locked, alone, in a box that felt as though it didnt like me being there. I was uncomfortable, to say the least. 

A mans voice first told me in a rather flat tone that Id be taking a hearing exam and to push the button whenever I heard something. I pushed the button. Being that I was a rather literal kid, I did as I was told: I heard him talking and I pushed the button. Im sure that pissed off some tech analyzing my readings somewhere else in the lab complex, but I had no idea what the rules were. The recording abruptly cut off and a new, flatter toned voice informed me that I was pushing the button when no tones were available and to please be sure I heard something before I pushed it again. Medical-ese for Hey, quit fucking doing that, youre messing it up. 

Then the tones started. Shrill, subdued, tinkling, silvery, deep, whispery, they played through both ears. I remember feeling intensely concentrated on hearing even the slightest little pitch. And then it happened. My ears began to ring. I could still hear the sounds of the test, but, in the background, an incessant, singular tone had begun to pervade the previous silence of my young ears. Through the tone, I could hear my pulse. My jaw began to ache and my eyes welled up with tears. The air in the booth felt hotter, stuffier, and more malevolent than ever. I wanted to get out. I pushed the button five more times before the flat-voiced man told me the test was complete and that I could exit the booth and receive my scores from the attending technician. 

Since that day, the ringing in my head has never stopped. In the dead of night, when my wife is snoring peacefully and I am, again, sleepless, that singular tone pervades the silence. Sometimes it is just a whisper; I wave it away and it disappears into the machinery that chugs along in my brain. Other times it is a freight train barreling through my skull, and I wonder where it is going. My pulse thunders in my ears and I am convinced the train is steaming by at full speed. I often dont hear it again for extended amounts of time. 

But some nights, I wonder what they buzzed into my ears that day in the little hateful box. I fear that Ill hear the train stop, the wheels grinding on rails that wend through my skull, and a little man with a flat voice will tell me, The test is now complete. Goodbye. </TEXT>

"Eject, Yellow 4."
"Did anyone see 4 get out?"

There's never any machissmo "let's kill em all", or, "this will be a fight to the death" crap from 13. He's just a flight lead who does his job and looks out for his squad mates. 

Those two lines of dialogue he has prove that, even in the midst of a chaotic aerial gang-bang, led by Mobius 1 and the rest of the victorious ISAF fighters, 13 only had eyes for 4 and her plight. 

What a leader, am I right? </TEXT>

Anyway, thanks for the tip, however there's one problem; the window doesn't open.

<TEXT> There Cant Be Two People Living in This Room

Is this a help me post? My prideful side says it isnt but that guys an asshole; help me.
******

Ill get straight to it. Theres someone else in this room. 
How do I know this? I find her hair every day in places that range from meh to what the hell?, if that makes any sense. 

Ive also found her journal. 

I know, I know; narrator-finds-spooky-journal-in-room-events-begin-to-unravel-BOOM-Paranormal Activity

Its not like that, I promise. 
*****

Maybe I should start from the beginning 	

My commander moved me into this room in a rush. Yes, Im in the Army and this is a barracks room. Its meant for two people to coexist in with very little privacy; two beds, two desks, two lamps, two trash cans, two sinks, two night stands, one toilet, one shower, one door, one window.  Two closets.  Two closets that lock.  Theres the shred of privacy this room offers: a closet that locks. Cool. 

That said, Im the only one in here.  

Well, at least I thought I was. 

The day I moved in here, I inventoried the room. Inventoried is a trumped-up phrase that basically means I looked around the room to make sure it was suitable for human usage and then threw all my shit in the closet and went to bed. I think I signed for the room and everything in it, but then again I may not have. All I really know is that I sleep here. And I havent been sleeping well. 

I remember that the first morning I woke up here, I got out of bed, went to the bathroom, got in the shower, and proceeded to pull one very long, black hair out from behind my ear as I scrubbed my head. 

I have red hair. 

 I am a male. 

Males in the Army arent allowed to have hair that sheds at almost 10 inches in length. 

 Thus bringing me to the conclusion that this was a females hair. 

 I brushed the occurrence off; Im married and know the perturbation that is finding my wifes hair literally everywhere all too well. I told myself, It must have come from somewhere. Ill just deep clean the room and vacuum and get rid of all of it, even if I cant see it. 

So I did.

 Its called a G.I. Party and basically you strip the room bare of furniture and go to town on that motherfucker with a mop, scrub brush, some water, some bleach, and some carpet cleaner. Everything gets a good coating of water and bleach (maybe Pine Sol if youre really trying hard), the carpet gets scrubbed by hand, and then you rinse everything off and let it dry for a couple hours before you hit the carpet with a vacuum and then move all the furniture back in.  Boom. Clean as a whistle, right?

Obviously not. 

I woke up the next morning and got in the shower. 

There was a single, long, black hair stuck to the wall of the shower. 

I know it wasnt there before. I know. 

But there it was. 

A few nights later, I noticed that this room really gets dark. I mean, like, cant-see-your-hand-in-front-of-your-face dark. This is an odd observation, because this barracks is notorious for soldiers putting up black out curtains on their windows in light, literally, of the fact that the windows sit situated in that perfect position where the sun blinds you in the morning as it comes up, and burns you up in the evening as it sets. 

But not my room. It gets *dark* in this motherfucker. Weird, right?

Its a bit ominous to be housed in a room that seems to relish the pitch black, and Ill admit that, every so often, I wonder if theres something moving behind the black veil that envelopes this room every night. 

*Okay*, Ive thought to myself, *this rooms a bit unsettling, but youre a reasonable person, do the math. Work the problem.*

Alright, the room can be opened one of two ways: either by card key, kind of like a hotel, or by hard key, like any normal door.  Okay, Im the only one with a hard key other than the master that all the sergeants have. 

But is a sergeant coming in this room and leaving her hair in my shower, one strand at a time?

Answer: most likely not; none of the female sergeants in this company know where Im staying because Im just assigned here temporarily. Plus, thats weird and I cant see a sergeant doing that to be creepy. Theres way too many Army regulations against being a creep, anyway. 

So maybe its another regular soldier whos getting in with their access card or something; maybe someone who stayed in this room who can still get in?

Answer: The card reader is broken. I put in a request for the batteries to be changed in it but the maintenance guy said the thing is just broken and needs to be replaced. So nobodys getting in that way. 


So, thus far, my conclusions led me to a fairly solid understanding that I am one of very few people who can get through this door and that there are even fewer who would do so for some dubious reason like leaving their long, black hairs scattered about. 

Hell, I dont even think theres a black-haired member of the cadre in this company anyway. 

Yet I keep finding hair.

Sometimes it'll be in my boot. Other times, I'll find it hanging limply from the back of one of the chairs. 

I'll find the hair in a pocket of a uniform, or, more disturbingly, laying across my face when I wake up. 

Moving on.

Then comes the third observation: Something or someone pissed on my bedding, and it wasnt me. 

I woke up two mornings ago to the extremely strong and familiar scent of urine. Ive worked in EMS and around animals enough to know what piss smells like. This particular aroma was a combination of dehydrated human and very rotten, old cat. It was gross. 

The issue was that when I went to bed, my bedding didnt smell like that. 

And, on top of that, I didnt even use the bedding that night; I slept under my woobie, which any respectable Army member knows all about. I love my woobie. CIF can go fuck themselves if they think Im turning it back in when I ETS. 

But yeah, my blankets absolutely reeked of this hybrid urine stink. 

I threw them in the trash yesterday. I can deal with most gross stuff, but piss-ruined things just go in the garbage, fuck salvaging them. The smell usually never washes out anyway, so why bother?

Now, I certainly didnt piss on the bedding. And I doubt that any sergeant from this company, wearing a wig of long, black hair and carrying one very old and dehydrated cat, did either. 

So who did?

Heres my guess: Amy-Lynn did it. 

*Who the hell is Amy-Lynn?!,* you may be asking. 

Amy-Lynn left her journal in this room. 

Amy-Lynn may also have left herself in this room.

Her journal starts off innocently enough, chronicling her decision to join the military and how proud she wanted to make her family and young daughter. I honestly felt bad for opening her private notebook, but she turned out to be a pretty good and coherent writer and I sort of enjoyed reading her journey through the initial entry into the military. 

At some point, though, she started to have trouble. She fought. She had an attitude with the cadre. She got fired from leadership positions. She fought some more. She missed home. She had to write essays on the importance of discipline. She missed home some more. It got pretty rough for her, from the look of it. But that happens to everybody, in some fashion when you're just starting out; I knocked a kid out in BCT because he refused to pronounce my name correctly. Still dont know why that mattered so much to me at the time, but fuck if he was going to screw my name up anymore on purpose, you know? 

Yeah, anyway, Amy-Lynn *really* started going through some shit, though. Her notes started to ramble. Her handwriting got worse. She started journalling later and later at night (she time stamped every note). And she started forgetting words in sentences; a misplaced the, or absent, and, occurring more frequently. 

Im not sure what exactly was happening with her, but to me it seems a little bit like a mental break. Like she just couldnt process everything fast enough and stuff started to snowball on her, you know? 

Her last entry fumbled through an account of how she fought with her roommate and the other girl ended up getting switched to a different barracks room because of it. 

So Amy-Lynn ended up alone in this room, at some point, while dealing with what I believe to be a psychotic melt down. 

As far as I know, these barracks have been here for at least 10 years, and the females stopped living anywhere but the fourth floor about 3 years ago. Which means Amy-Lynn lived in this room from anywhere between 2006 to 2013. 

I sincerely hope she has not been in this room that long.

For her sake and mine. 

Mainly mine. 

Fuck this room gets dark. 

Ive got my computer brightness turned down so it doesnt burn my retinas out, but it sincerely feels like Im typing this from the inside of a black velvet box. 

And all the while I get the feeling that there are eyes on the other side of the room; watching and waiting. Watching and waiting. 

Can you help me figure this out? Anything would be appreciated. Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My name is Melanie Jane Nance, today is March 22nd, 2016, and Ive waited a very long time for this.
*****

When I was growing up, I remember walking into my parents room and seeing my Dad on top of a woman. It wasnt my mom.

Dad told me to never breathe a word of what I saw to anyone. Ever. He told me that good girls love their daddies no matter what they do, and that hed always love me no matter what *I* did. I remember his eyes being so full of love when he said that. My Daddy meant so much to me, and I knew hed never hurt me. I believed him when he said hed always love me.

But I didnt love Patty. And she didnt love me either. She just loved my Daddy. And God. I heard her say Gods name a lot when they were together.

I hated Pattys face. She had this smile that, to everyone else, seemed to say, I love you, I am so glad youre in my life right now. To me, I knew it was a smile that said, I hate every inch of your existence.

One night, in high school, I snuck over to Pattys house after work at the restaurant. She was putting on makeup in her mirror; I could see her through the window.

I knocked on her front door.

She looked surprised to see me.

Melanie?, I remember her asking, as if she didnt know it was me.

I finished fixing up her face for her that night. She didnt need all that makeup anyway.

A few weeks later I met James. He was with another girl at a dinner/dance for my school. The other girl was Karen, someone who my friends were friends with, but we werent really friends. I stole James from her that night.

Karen hated me for that.

But that was okay, James and I started our lives that night. What other people thought didnt matter anymore. All that mattered was that he looked at me with those same eyes that my daddy did all those years ago. Those eyes that said, No matter what you do, Ill always love you.

Thats why, that day in the house, after Id phoned 911, thats why I knew James had come back to me.

I know it was him.

His smell gave him away. I always liked that smell. The way it would roll off him while we were tangled up in bed together. A mixture of Old Spice aftershave and lavender soap. I knew it was him when he walked in the door of that house.

When the police escorted me out, I knew I couldnt let that be the last time that I got to be his wife. That house should be mine. He should be mine.

*Mine*.

And he knows it.

Its why he always comes back.

He wont have any other choice, now that Ive fixed everything.

It was so easy. So easy to follow her to work. To wait in the parking lot, biding my time. Im very good at waiting.

She was late leaving the school building. Her pretty hair and silky dress were blowing in the cool breeze as she walked out to her car. God, I hated that happy look on her face.

*Someone should wipe that off for her*, I thought.

And then I stepped around from behind the car.

The baseball bat connected with the side of her head and she shrieked. She never saw me coming. Like I said, Im good at this.

I wiped her face off for her. My swings gradually sinking deeper and deeper into her skull. That same wet impact I remembered from the forest five years ago

She was still gurgling, I could see the air bubbles coming up through the wrecked hole that used to be her mouth.

I leaned down in close to her and whispered, *Mine*.

The bat was in two pieces in my hand. I dropped the thickest part next to her head as I walked away. Her initial scream hadnt even attracted the school security guard; he was still asleep in his car where hed been all day.

See, James is mine. Hes been mine since I laid eyes on him in high school. Through everything we went through together, even that night in the woods, hes never not been mine. Thats why he comes back to me. When we first met, I remember how he would look into my eyes and say, Forever. And I knew he meant it. He loved me for who I was. He still loves me for who I am.

Hes *my* monster.

Every time he comes back, theres less and less of him left. But I know hes still in there, somewhere inside that shell.

I know hes still mine.

*Mine*.

Oh good, theres the ambulance. I guess somebody noticed her. About time.

My name is Melanie Jane Nance and Im *very* good at waiting. March 22nd, 2016

<DATE> 2016-03-21 04:27:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My name is Allen Hutchins and something weird happened on March 9th, 2016.

Well, things have been "weird" for awhile, but I guess a guy with a blown off face who looks a lot like your partner might take the cake.
*****

I should probably explain what I mean.

Jimmy- I never call him James- and I have been best friends since high school. Since before that crazy chick Melanie walked into his life and nearly fucking ended it.

I remember when he met Mel.

He'd just come off a bad breakup with this extremely gorgeous girl named Erica. When she broke it off with Jimmy as suddenly as she did, I thought I'd never see my friend smile again.

But then one night he came back from a party with a bunch of kids from another school, raving about this "incredible" girl he'd met while he was there. Her name was Melanie and you'd have thought this girl was made of fucking gold or something, the way he described her. In his mind, especially at the beginning, she could do no wrong.

The first time I actually met her, I almost gagged when I saw the way she clung to Jimmy's arm, her eyes barely ever leaving his face. To me, it was disgusting how much she adored him, but I guess to anyone else it must have been just the cutest thing they'd ever seen. I remember I had to tell her my name twice. Whatever, she never cared to get it right anyway; she was always calling me Alex. God, that was fucking annoying.

Jimmy was a hit with her family. They loved that their only daughter, the princess of the family, had found herself a boy who didn't seem like he just wanted to "hit it and quit it".

Theyre so cute! became the chorus around our hometown whenever people would see them out in public together. I just grit my teeth and grinned through it; no way was I going to bad-mouth my best friends relationship, especially not in front of them. Jimmy meant a lot to me. He still does. I mean, the guy changed my life. Well, the better way to put that is that he saved my life, and then a lot of things changed after that.

Spring Break of Sophomore year in college, we got the bright idea to go camping up in the mountains in eastern Arkansas. I had no idea what the fuck I was doing, agreeing to go on as ambitious of a trip as Jim had planned, but we were going to be having bro time and, better yet, Mel wasnt going to be coming with us. Seemed like a solid plan to me, right?

We must have hiked something like 18 miles that first day out. Jimmy, ever the adventure seeker, wanted us to push as far into the wilderness as we could. I, on the other hand, thought that every clearing we bypassed seemed like a good place to make camp and start in on the alcohol wed brought along with us.

That night seems like a blur now.

We made camp when the sun started to set and the rain moved in. We built a fire, ate some dinner, and were just popping open our first beers of the night when Jims fucking phone buzzed in his pocket.

To this day, I have no idea how there was cell signal so far out in the middle of the damn forest, but fuck me if it wasnt Melanie texting up a storm, trying to figure out why Jimmy hadnt responded to her in 4 hours. Jesus, that girl drove me up the wall. My buddy must have been a strong man to not be annoyed by her or he was just that damn good at not showing it. Either way, stronger man than I.

He put the phone away, finally, and we kicked back a couple more brews before we crawled into the tent and knocked out.

The next thing I remember is Jimmy dragging my barely-conscious ass out of the tent as the sound of rushing water issued from somewhere extremely close by.

In the night, the river had risen a good 20 feet and was in the process of washing away our campsite. My sorry ass had been so dead asleep, that had Jim not acted as quickly as he did, I damn sure would have been floating down that roaring river, probably never to be seen again.

He pulled me, still zipped up in my sleeping bag, at least 200 feet up a steep embankment.

Thanks for dragging me across all those damn rocks, dickhead, I remember ribbing him.

That was a lot closer than I thought itd be, he mumbled, staring down at the still-rising waters of the Buffalo river.

We hoofed it back to the truck and drove all night to get back to the university campus. I guess we probably got in around 12:30 or 1 in the afternoon. We were wet, muddy, and extremely tired.

So when my phone started blowing up as soon as I got it charged in my room, I was, to put it nicely, fucking pissed.

-Allen, oh my god. Melanie is such a raging bitch. I need you to calm me down-

It was my girlfriend, Elyse. Texting me with more ferocity than Id ever seen her display in my life. There must have been 20+ messages, all to the tune of: -I just watched Mel inviting some guy up to her room to watch a movie, what do you think I should do? Do you want to tell James?-

-Dude, WTF?! The third guy tonight just went in her room. I feel like such a creep spying out my peephole. But shes such a bitch. Can I have permission to beat her face in?-

It went on and on. The messages started from two hours after we left the day before and went all the way up until the time when we pulled back on campus in Jims swamp-ass truck. That bitch Melanie must have booted her last muse out when she realized Jimmy was back on campus. Things were headed downhill. Fast.

How was I supposed to let my best friend know that the girl he called the love of his life was fucking around on him with, not one, but at least three other guys?

I couldnt believe it the first time he called Mel that, actually. I always figured he was biding his time, waiting for the right moment to break it off with her. He had to have seen she was nuts, right? But I guess that was Jim, always sacrificing himself for the sake of others. Id seen it first hand not even 24 hours before.

I regret this next set of events so much that, even 5 years later, it still makes me physically sick to think about.

Not knowing what to do, or how to confront Jimmy with the truth, I did what any college kid does in a stressful situation: I fell asleep.

I woke up hours later with a bunch of annoyed texts from Elyse, and one from Jim that read:

-Hey man, Mel and I are headed back out to the campsite to try to find all the gear we lost. She said she wanted to help, guess she missed me while we were gone. Haha. Later brother, see you when we get back.-

Fuck.

If there was anyone I did NOT want to be out in the woods alone with, other than the fucking Sasquatch, it was probably Melanie.

Deep down, I had this gut feeling that tonight was going to be bad. Bad for me or for Jimmy, I wasnt sure, but this time I couldnt just fall back asleep.

I hurried down stairs, stopping to grab Elyse from her dorm despite her protests, jumped in my 4Runner, and headed back toward the campsite. It would take hours, but I knew I needed to be doing what I was doing, even if I couldnt explain that to Elyse in human language. Sometimes you just know, you know?

Im not sure how we managed it, especially in the damn dark, but eventually Elyse and I made it to Jim and Is flooded out camp ground. The water had receded during the day, leaving behind a muddy, swampy, disgusting tract of forest that was scattered with various bits of our abandoned gear.

As we got to the point where I was pretty sure we had put our tent, I thought I heard a skittering sound off in the trees, just outside the beam of my flashlight.

Allen, what the hell was that?, I heard Elyse whisper.

I pulled her in close to me, sensing that someone or something else was there with us.

SCRUNCH

I whirled around and for a split second could have sworn I saw wavy brown hair and a maroon jacket fleeing the exposure of my light.

That was when I heard the groaning.

Behind us, there was this sickening, wet, low cry of pain coming from the damp, dark woods.

It was Jimmy.

I ran to him, sloshing through inches of mud and muck, not caring anymore about the eerie feeling of being watched from a distance.

His face was almost fucking caved in.

Oh my god dude, whatd she do to you?, I remember saying as I flipped him over to keep him from fucking suffocating in the mud.

And then Elyse was by my side and we were tearing our clothes to make bandages and sloshing water into his mouth, desperately trying to keep my best friend from fucking dying in my arms.

Now it was my turn to save him.

That was the last time I think Ive been afraid in the face of death. Something about basically holding your best friends life in your hands has a tendency to shift your priorities. Things changed for me that night; I discovered that snatching people from the jaws of death was a terrifying, exhilarating experience that gave me a high more than any drug Id ever tried in my life.

I have Jimmy to thank for that realization. Like I said, the dude changed my life.

Once Jim recovered, I told him about my decision to become a Paramedic. Even in his drugged-up stupor, even with a semi-crushed face, my best friend still found the strength to smile and mumble the words, Thats awesome, brother. Youll be amazing at that.

Jim doesnt remember much from that night. He says sometimes hell have flashes of what happened, like a half-remembered dream, but hes still not sure of the details of what exactly happened out there in those lonely woods.

Nobody has seen Melanie since that night, either.

I think she finally fucking lost it and attacked my best bud out there in the dark. She knew she was going to have to face up to the fact that she was cheating at some point, and Id bet dollars to donuts she planned to leave Jimmy for dead out there once shed satisfactorily demolished his face.

Thankfully, something about that night broke Jim of his infatuation with that crazy, crazy bitch.

He doesnt talk much about her anymore. In fact, I had the honor of being Jimmys best man last year as he wed the real love of his life, Sarah.

Sarah is so beautiful, and so much the polar opposite of Melanie that I have to resist jumping up and down like a kid in a Lego store every time I see them together. She loves Jim. Shes kind, understanding, and always comforts him when he has his nightmares. Shes even learned to cope with the mental fog that Jim has sometimes suffered from ever since Melanie nearly killed him in those lonely woods almost 5 years ago.

Shes good for him, and he absolutely deserves someone like her after what he went through with Mel.

Now, about the weird stuff. As if everything Ive said so far hasnt been weird enough.

The day we got the call for Jims house, I felt my heart sink into my damn feet.

No way could he lose Sarah so abruptly like that. No way. Life is a fucking bitch, but I didnt realize how much of one it could be until that moment.

So imagine my god damn surprise when we walked into the bedroom and found some fucking random guy with his face shot off laying on the floor.

I went into Medic Mode and just started doing my job. But I couldnt help but notice the similarities between the no-face guy and my partner, Jimmy, who was kneeling at the guys feet with this look on his face like someone had hit him in the head with a brick.

No-face guy was built just like Jim. Tough upper body, scars here and there, even a half-sleeve tattoo on his arm, although it looked a bit different and of less quality than Jimmys Demon of Razgriz sleeve.

I had to shake off the eeriness of the situation and just get to work trying to save this dude. Details be damned, just do your job, right?

At some point Jim shook off that foggy look too and we were operating like we always do, our decision-making process in sync, never needing to ask for what the other person was already handing our way. Fuck, were a good team. And we did what we could for that poor guy.

As we loaded that faceless man onto our cot and hurried him to the truck, I could have sworn I saw a mess of wavy brown hair and a maroon jacket entering a police cruiser parked on the street

*Not possible. Focus, you*, I remember thinking.

Homeboy made it to the hospital, but I was there when the trauma doc called the resuscitory efforts off and pronounced the guy dead. Nothing we could do except our best. And thats what we did.

Well, shit, dispatch is giving us a call. Id better finish this up, quick.

They finally put James back to work after a week or so off. The dead guy in his house shook him up pretty bad, though he hasnt mentioned seeing Mel at all.

Maybe I imagined it? Thats probably for the best.

I need my bud to help keep me sane sometimes, so I cant have him going off the deep end, at least not before I do.

God, this job really grinds on you at times. Wed better answer this call before dispatch has us written up.

My names Allen Hutchins, and my partner, Jimmy Nance, is doing just fine on March 20th, 2016.

My name is Melanie Jane Nance, and my husband, James Edgar Nance, died on March 9th, 2011.

I have killed him every year since that day. Five times now. 

He always comes back.
*****

I guess I need to start at the beginning. 

We met in high school. He was funny, goofy, and kind of cute, even for a band nerd. But I was a band nerd too, and it felt nice to be around someone who liked the same things I did.

He didnt know he was my first boyfriend. The look on his face was so funny when he realized he was my first kiss; a mixture of shock, embarrassment, and humility that just made me like him even more. He said it meant more to him, too, knowing it was my first. He was that kind of guy.

James was my first everything: My first kiss, my first boyfriend, my first love, my first orgasm, best friend, fiancee, and eventually husband. We were married when we were 22, fresh out of college after nearly 5 years of dating and engagement. I was so ready to be his that I ignored the truth, the reality, of what he became during our Sophomore year of college. 


He had said it would be nothing. That it was just a spontaneous, fun trip to the Ozark mountains for some Spring Break camping. Just he and a friend named Alex. Theyd be gone three days, tops. 

And then, like clockwork, the Buffalo river flooded in the same area it had every spring for the past 5 years. Only a year before, a family of four was swept away in the rising flood waters after camping too close to the river bed. It was likely, the authorities said, that the family washed away as they slept, never realizing the danger creeping up on them in the night. 

I got a text from him on March 8th at around 9 at night:

I cant believe theres cell signal out here, but I wanted to let you know that were done for the day. It started raining earlier but were headed to bed now. I love you, good night.

He always told me goodnight. Even after our biggest fights, me storming away to recompose myself or him frustratedly shrugging off back to his dorm, I could always count on that good night message. 

It reassured me that he was okay and still thinking about me, even out there on his bro time trip. So I fell asleep.

I snapped awake as my phone vibrated itself off my bedside table and onto the floor.

Picking it up, I noticed a text from James:

Rain picked up during the night. Woke up with everything in the tent floating. Abandoned camp when we saw rushing water 20 feet away from us. Heading to higher ground. I love you.

It worried me that at 3 in the morning, out in the middle of nowhere, my boyfriend was abandoning a flooded campsite and moving further into the dark woods. 

I felt helpless, but he always told me about being a Boy Scout and I figured he knew what he was doing out there. 

I fell back asleep.

At 9 that morning a knock on my door woke me up. It was James. Somehow, in 5 hours, he had trudged at least 15 miles, in the rain, through the Ozark foothills, made it back to his truck, and back to our college campus, 4 hours away. 

I should have seen it then. Should have known right then that something sinister was happening. But it was 9 in the morning during Spring Break, and I hadnt had any coffee yet. 

All the rest of that morning was spent in a bliss of making out and getting hands-y in my empty dorm. 

But then, his attitude turned somber, his tone and expression aloof.

I need to go back out there. I left something, he said suddenly, his eyes clouding up like they did when he was regretting a decision. 

It was dark when we got back to where his campsite had been. We had driven all afternoon. 

He led me deep into the woods, always staying ahead of me. It almost felt like he had forgotten I was with him, but every now and then he would shoot me a worried glance, his eyes full of apprehension, darting around as if he expected someone else to be trailing after us. 

As we reached a clearing, he suddenly whirled on me, and the powerful man I always knew he could be was inexplicably forcing me to the damp forest floor. Not knowing what was happening, I half-resisted him. If this was some sexual thing, I wanted him to feel like he at least earned his prize, you know? 

But his eyes seemed dead. There was no life behind the bright grey-blue that I usually looked up into when he was on top of me. 

It scared me, and I began to fight back. Hard. 

And that was when hehissed at me.

I scrambled to my feet and tried to run. He caught my ankle as I turned and I kicked back, trying to break his grasp.

I guess I kicked harder than I thought I could, though, because as my foot hit him square in the face, I heard a sickening *CRACK* and felt a wet, damp impact. He dropped right where he knelt, a pool of blood forming around his head as he lay face down in the leaves and dirt. 

I knew he was dead. I had just killed the love of my life. And I screamed. I screamed my voice to shreds. I screamed until all that came out was a harsh, torn sound like static turned up too loud. 

Every year since then I have killed James, in one way or another, when he inevitably returns to me.

Its always the same. March 9th, a knock at the door, I open it, and there he is. 

Ive poisoned him, Ive lured him into car accidents, stabbed him, and just yesterday I brought him into our bedroom and shot him in the head. 

Sometimes I let him stay. Sometimes I finish him off immediately. 

In 2014 I kept his third version alive long enough for us to get married. We were 22 by then. The ceremony was beautiful, and I was such a happy bride. 

Nobody knew that the man standing next to me, kissing me at the altar, dancing with me at the reception, was a sham. A shell, the husk of my husband filled withsomething else. 

Nobody knew that the woman in the beautiful white dress, looking up at her groom in adoration, seemingly filled with hope for her new married life, was a murderer. 

I killed that version of him after we consummated our marriage that night, my wedding dress stinking of sex and gore as I stuffed his remains into the dumpster behind the hotel. 

Our honeymoon consisted of me drinking alone on a beach in Cozumel. I was hammered for 9 straight days. 

The truth of it is that I can always count on him coming back to me. I just come up with a different excuse for his prolonged absence every time he disappears. 

Sometimes hes working out of country. Other times hes on a dedicated night shift at the ambulance company. Sometimes I put on my best devastated wife face and claim hes run off with another woman in California. 

Yesterday there was a knock at the door. 

It was him.

I already told you that I lured him to bed. I put on my hungriest eyes for him, did my best to entice what little of his humanity he had left. 

He stalked toward me on the bed and took his normal place on top of me. His weight felt good against my hips and, just for a second, I imagined that it was really him again. I imagined that I had my love back

And then I put the gun against his temple and pulled the trigger. 

Not for the first time was I covered in my husbands blood. 

I pushed him off of me, picked up the phone, and dialed 911. 

I told the officers my husband had just committed suicide. Again, I put on the best devastated wife show in history. 

They ushered me out the back door as the EMS crew came in the front, and for a second I thought I saw

No, he never comes back that fast. 

Ill be moving out, I suppose. Its hard to hush up your husbands death when the cops and paramedics and news vans are all parked outside your house. 

Maybe in this new life, he wont find me. 

Maybe this will all be over. 

I can only hope. 

My name is Melanie Jane Nance and I killed my husband for the fifth time on March 9th, 2016.

Goodbye.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Day I Died in Little Rock, Arkansas </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-19 00:23:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My name is James Edgar Nance and I died in Little Rock, Arkansas on the 9th of March, 2016. 

I have no idea how I am able to tell you that.

Because I am very much alive. 
*****

It happened like this:

My partner and I were sitting at the Burger King at the corner of Markham and Chenal Parkway, quietly cat-napping in the cab of our Ambulance. 

I'm an EMT-B and my partner, Allen, is a Paramedic. 

Paramedics save lives, EMT's save Paramedics. It's an old saying that I like to remind Allen of whenever he starts thinking he's an EMS God. 

Really, I just drive the truck and make sure I don't kill him while he's taking care of the patient in the box. 

So we're sitting at BK, trying to catch some extra rest, when the radio crackles to life. 

-"Unit 722, you have an incoming emergency in the area of Evergreen and Mississippi."-

Sleepily, I grabbed the radio and mumbled, "22, go ahead with that call", while straightening my seat up and buckling my seat belt.

Dispatch replied back a few moments later:

-"22, start toward the area of Evergreen and Mississippi, hold back in the area 'til I get further."-

I felt my blood start to pump a little harder; we were headed to *my* neighborhood. 

Any time Dispatch tells us to "hold back" on a call, it means there is potentially a dangerous situation still in the works of being controlled by the Little Rock Police. My EMS company has a strict policy that we do not go onto unsecured scenes if the dispatcher feels there is a risk to us, the responding crew. If someone else is hurt, why should we get hurt too? That's the logic behind the policy.

I shifted the truck into drive and pulled away from our shady napping spot and started in the direction of the call. 

Any time we hold back on a call, it usually gives us the chance to park the truck and sit somewhere for a few minutes before we're cleared to go in safely. In this instance, that pause in response would have given my partner and I to wipe some of the sleep from our eyes and be fully awake when we finally rolled up on scene. 

Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.

Dispatch radioed us again as we made the turn up Mississippi toward Evergreen:

-"722, your scene is secure. You're responding to 7502 N Street, as in November, for a 9 Echo 1. Little Rock Police on scene. Time en route, 1425."-

I jammed the accelerator of that ambulance down as far as it would go, and likely would have dug it into the pavement below us had it not been for the floorboard. 

A 9 Echo 1 is the call determinant that tells us a patient is unresponsive, pulse-less, and not breathing.

We were headed to my house. 
Where my wife and I live.

Allen was hanging on for dear life as I rounded the 90 degree corner onto N street at a cool 45 miles an hour, the G-force warning indicator under his seat screaming at me that I was on the verge of rolling our box over.

I looked square at him as we screeched to a halt in front of my house.
"You had better fucking save her or I'll beat you to death. Let's go to fucking work", I said. 
All he did was nod. That was all I needed him to do. 

We yanked our supplies out of the back and hustled to my front door. The front door of my home where the person I loved more than anything else in all of existence was currently trying to leave me, forever. 

A cop tried to stop me as I crossed my threshold, saying, "It's pretty nasty, dude. I don't know if there's much you can do."

"Get the fuck out of my way and never say anything like that to me again", I spat back in his face.

As I stepped through the front door, I thought I saw a mess of wavy brown hair and maroon hoodie leaving through the back. 

*Focus*, I thought, *she needs you*.

Another officer waved me into my own bedroom. The familiar smell of my wife's dry shampoo, her robe tossed haphazardly on the bed where I saw her drop it this morning, my wad of clothes in the corner, not really clean, not really dirty, still wearable, every detail stood out as I steeled myself for what I was about to find on the far side of our bed. 

I stopped abruptly in my tracks. 

It wasn't my wife on the floor, trying to die. Not my wife at all. 

It was me. 

The impossibility of the situation was overshadowed, somehow, by the fact that most of his (my) face was gone. 

"Looks like he shot himself", said the officer behind me, "We found the .40cal handgun next to him."

Neither Allen nor I said a word. We just went to work. 

On me. 

He, well, I, was still breathing. 

I could see the air bubbling up through the crimson blood issuing from the mess that had once been my face. A breathing patient is a live patient, and I reached for the trauma backpack, yanking out the bag-valve-mask and O2 tubing and attaching both to his face and the portable O2 on the floor next to me. Not a moment later I noticed his respiratory effort give out. 

I checked for a pulse and felt none. 

"He just coded", I vocalized loudly to Allen. 

"Put him on the monitor, put the shock pads on his chest", Allen shot back. 

I unpacked our heart monitor and connected the defibrillator pads to the charging port. Then I stuck the pads to his chest. 

His familiar anatomy momentarily distracted me; the scar on the right collar bone from a nasty hockey stick slash, the half-sleeve tattoo of the Demon of Razgriz on the left arm, the trimmed abdominal hair from when I "man-scaped" two days ago. 

It was definitely me. 

As if from a distance, I heard Allen say, "Asystole, begin CPR." 

I began doing chest compressions on myself. 

Our CPR protocols state that after 2 minutes of quality rescue breathing and chest compressions, we're allowed a brief pause to let our heart monitor re-analyze the patient for any sign of a recoverable heart rhythm. 

The mechanical, robotic voice of the monitor blared out, "Analyzing rhythm, DO NOT touch the patient. DO NOT touch the patient."

As the machine finished its work, the flat line of the leads readout began to change, its place taken by a flitting, irregular pattern that we call an "agonal rhythm". Agonal heart rhythms are a really solid indicator that someone is circling the drain but hasn't quite been flushed down the death tube yet. 

Agonal heart rhythms are also candidates for getting a big, fat ZAP from the defibrillator. 

And that's what we did. 

And we kept ZAP-ping him (me) all the way to the hospital, in an effort to keep me alive. 

Our ambulance ripped into the parking bay of the University Hospital and no sooner had we stopped than Allen and a tag-along firefighter had him out of the box, and into the Emergency Room. 

Meanwhile, I stepped out of the cab and promptly threw up my entire existence onto the sidewalk outside the ER doors. 

How was this possible?

I had entered that house, *my* house, fully prepared to snatch my darling wife back from the threshold of death, only to be presented with my own, barely-alive, severely-maimed, almost-corpse self. 

*What the FUCK is going on?!*, I screamed internally. 

I stepped into the University ER just as I saw the trauma response doctors leaving the room. They were pulling off their blue exam gloves, shaking their heads. 

"What dumb fuck shoots themselves in the head and *misses*?", I heard one say to the other. 

Allen stepped out from behind the curtain in the room. 

"They're about to call it. Nothing we could do man", he said as he walked past. 

I pulled the curtain open and stepped in just as I heard a physician say, "...time of death, 1408."

The nurses and doctors began to quietly excuse themselves from the room. I felt somebody pat my shoulder as they passed, probably as a "nice try" condolence or something. 

They had no idea. 

Allen had no idea. 

It was beginning to dawn on me that the combination of my missing face, my insistence on social privacy, and the fact that my wife never saw me walk in meant that *nobody* realized the gravity of what was really happening.

Nobody knew that I had just watched myself die. 

I wish that were the end of the strange things that have been happening. 

This is why I need your help. 

Because I died.

But I'm alive.

My name is James Edgar Nance and I am alive in Little Rock, Arkansas on the 18th of March, 2016.

<TEXT> Alright, let's get the formalities out of the way first. 

My name is 2nd Lieutenant Sean Smith of the Minnesota Air National Guard 109th Airlift Squadron, 133rd Airlift Wing. I am a navigator on board the H and J models of the C-130 Hercules aircraft. I am a part of a crew of three commissioned and two enlisted personnel who act as Pilots, Navigator (me), Flight Engineer, and Load Master. 

My job is to correctly plot our course of travel on any given mission, provide corrections and advice on scheme of maneuvers in the case of mission alteration, and to advise the Load Master on distance, direction, and speed of the aircraft in order to facilitate the off-loading of personnel and supplies. Basically I tell the guy in the back when to open the door and get ready to shove people/things out of the airplane. 

Enough of that, though.

Our planes have low-light television feeds in order to show us what's going on outside the aircraft from various angles. We also have an on-board Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) array on the nose of the aircraft. All that to say, we can see in the dark. 

For the past two nights, we have had cancelled, or, as we call them, "scrubbed", missions on account of the fact that there have been multiple sightings of unidentifiable, person-shaped objects interfering with flight line activity. 

I was on one of the cancelled aircraft. 
*****

Sitting at my station just aft of the engineer and pilot's chairs, I was startled when I heard one of the two pilots yelp and jump hard enough in his seat to whack his head against the glass panel on his side of the cockpit. 

It was nearing 2 AM so I kind of suspected he had nodded off during pre-flight and done one of those spastic, "hypnic jerk"s and scared himself awake. 

Then, Brandon, the engineer, hissed in surprise and I looked up to the cockpit window in time to see a dark, shadowy figure *run* past the nose of the aircraft. This would have been all well and good, were it not for the fact that our front windows are about 35 vertical feet off of the ground. 

There was a thud against the side of the aircraft.

Right in front of my navigator station.

Then, a long, painfully loud screeching, tearing noise swept down the right side of the aircraft. 

At this point, the pilots turned on the TV and FLIR feeds to be able to see what was going on. The aircraft commander popped his window open and poked his head out of the cabin to see what caused the noise.

Simultaneously, the TV feed picked up four shapes running straight at the nose of our aircraft, and the AC ducked his head *quickly* back inside the airplane. 

He was as white as the socks on his feet. And the guy is Hawaiian. 

I don't know what he saw, but the AC didn't talk to us the rest of the night. I mean, the lights were on, but nobody was home. 
*****

Before I go any further, I should clarify that we're not in Minnesota right now. We're in Little Rock, Arkansas, training at Jacksonville AFB, "The Home of the Combat Airlift". 

J-ville has a *really* bad reputation for having absolute shit security. There have been something like 9 unauthorized incursions onto the base in the last year and two fatal shootings at both the main entrances. 

The last guy the Security Forces zapped ran the gate at the north entrance, got out of his vehicle screaming about how Colonel Sanders and Ulysses S. Grant sent him to kill the "Black Ops Guys", produced a rifle from the trunk of the car, and was promptly acquainted with two 5.56x45mm rounds to the chest. Dead right there. 

The Security Forces commander on base made sure to put out a comminque about how thus far there had been no service member injuries or fatalities in any of these incidents and how everyone was perfectly safe, go about your business.

Tell that to the things running at my aircraft at 2 o'clock in the morning, asshole. 
*****

Okay so, at this point our AC was brain-fried. Whatever he saw just flipped the switch for him, I guess.

Our co-pilot is in the other seat trying to simultaneously deal with ATC, our ground crew, the aircraft itself, *and* the pack of what-the-fuck's flinging themselves at our aircraft. 

The engineer took control of the FLIR and TV feeds and started panning as far left and right as he could in big sweeps to try to get vis on our unwelcome guests. As he panned across for a third time, there was a big THUD against the nose and our power and lights flickered. 

Something grabbed the TV/FLIR array and began to pull. 

Something with a clearly distinguishable face. 

In the black-and-white feed, all I could see was the upper half of a face. Cracked, scaly looking skin pulled tight around a set of sunken eyes with no iris or pupils. Lifeless, white eyes. 

But it wasn't in our FLIR feed. It should have been registering as white-hot mass on our display, but FLIR was saying nothing was there. 

Both screens crackled as this thing yanked the whole array around past its horizontal limit. The feeds vanished, our power flickered again, and there was another long screech that tore down the side of the airplane. 

Then, silence. 

I was in a Herc once that got backed into by a loading truck. The truck nearly caved in a portion of the bulkhead just aft of the left wing, but the bump felt the same as if a big bird had run into the side of the plane. 

The last THUD against the side of the aircraft that night was so loud and accompanied by such an impact that I was sure it had lifted us completely off the ground on one side.  

At that point, the co-pilot called the tower and declared a ground emergency. 

Not wanting to sound like a crazy, sleep-deprived maniac, he explained that there was an issue with the landing gear and that he needed to cancel his taxi roll and return to the shed. 

The lights and power flickered again and a deep, sinister laugh echoed through the flight deck from somewhere behind us. Somewhere very close to where I was sitting. 

I was out of my seat, out the dorsal escape hatch, down the side of the plane and on the tarmac, sprinting back to the support section faster than I have ever moved *in my life*. 

Later I found out that the other four guys initiated the emergency egress procedures at nearly the same split-second as I did and were hot on my heels, getting the hell away from the aircraft as fast as humanly possible. 

The following morning, it was determined that our TV/FLIR array was totally destroyed by a force or impact that nearly ripped it from its mount and almost completely off of the airplane. 

There were gouges and dents running almost the complete length of the fuselage; long scratches and welts that looked like claw or teeth marks. 

Our wing commander wrote the incident off as damage caused by a lightning strike, even though there was no inclement weather in any part of the state that night. He praised us for acting quickly and following procedures to the letter, but reprimanded us for abandoning the aircraft so soon after declaring a ground emergency.

Whatever the case may be, I firmly believe that something diabolical found its way inside our ship that night and intended to do us harm.

That asshole Security Force commander says we're safe here. Nothing can get us. 

I beg to differ.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Broken arrow is a combat communications directive, sir. It's used when a friendly unit is overrun or goes "black" on ammunition and requires all available fire support, CAS, and QRF assets dispatched to their location coordinates. It's basically the "hey, get here or we're gonna fucking die" alert from Troops In Contact.

<TEXT> This scenario happens way more often than one would expect.

When I was 20 I was out hunting on a friend's property when this tall, thin figure stood up from a field of thigh-high grass about 600 yards away from me. 

Through the x3 power scope on my .30-06 I couldn't clearly see what it was, and began to assume that it was a deer standing either facing directly at me or directly away from me, because I wasn't seeing the large, obvious side-on profile of a normal deer.

The shape was the right height and color to be a deer and I was sitting in a blind overlooking a field that deer regularly crossed in between patches of wooded area. So the thing must have been a deer...at least that's what my brain was telling me.

I chambered a round, clicked the safety over to "fire" and was just about to exhale and wait for my sight picture to steady out, when something in my head yelled *STOP*.

I put the rifle back on "safe" and pulled up the binoculars around my neck, and, sure as shit, this fucking moron *man* clearly comes into focus. Asshole had no orange on whatsoever, was in full camo, and was most likely on my friend's property without permission.

God damn idiot came about 1.5 seconds away from being dead as fuck. (I'm an excellent shot with a rifle...can't hit shit with a shotgun) </TEXT>

<TEXT> unsurprising. It costs like $45,000 of ground maintenance *per flight hour* and the ratio of ground maintenance to flight time is somewhere between 11-18 hours for every 1 hour spent in the air. 
EVERY aircraft has to undergo a monthly maintenance package that, alone, costs like $125K. 
The A-10 was supposed to go out of service this year, but, because this production halt for the Raptor was already in the works, the A-10 has been spared the chopping block.

<TEXT> agree to disagree. Even in Army training scenarios we don't go anywhere alone. If we are going solo, we have to have that contingency plan like I talked about. 

Same deal with flying; flight plans have to be filed to let people know where you're going, who's going with, when you're leaving, and what time you're arriving.

<TEXT> There's a new aviation documentary on Netflix about the origins of the Israeli Air Force.
Flying American made transport aircraft illegally smuggled out of the U.S.A. and second-hand, "spare parts" Czechoslovakian Me109's, about 100 men and women helped save the infant Israeli state from utter destruction in 1948. 
Some great stories in the film and absolutely heroic efforts from ordinary men and women.
Worth watching.

<TEXT> thank goodness; another musically inclined person! I have a bachelor's in music so I actually understood everything! 

I can vouch for dark churches being extremely unsettling places. I used to be the worship leader at a small baptist church in Arkansas while I was in college. I routinely got to the church early on Sunday mornings and stayed late on Wednesday nights to be able to get my worship set lists together and to set up the stage in the right configuration for however many instrumentalists/vocalists I would be using that week. 

Our sanctuary was probably only about 20 pews deep with a single aisle up the middle, but even though it was a small room, it got absolutely pitch dark at night. Dark to the point that you couldn't see the sound booth in the back left corner of the room when you looked out from the stage. 

One night I'm finishing up coiling cables and moving the drum set and guitar amps and I hear the sound system kick on with a sizzle and hissing noise. Were it not for the fact that I had just turned *off* that system about 10 minutes prior, I would have thought nothing of it. The power switches are in two different locations in the room; one in the storage area behind the stage where the actual amps are, and one in the sound booth completely opposite the stage on the other side of the room. At least 100 yards difference between the two locations. 

So the whole thing hisses to life and I'm standing on the stage like "uhm, what?"

I go back to the sound booth and the whole sound board is lit up with its various LED indicators and as I go to switch it off, this roaring feedback comes blasting out of the house speakers. I mean it really sounded like a freight train mixed with this humming scream behind it. As best I can describe, it was like the "smoke monster" noise from the TV series *Lost* but with a ton more weight behind it.

I flipped the power off in the sound booth and it cut off as quickly as it began. I immediately left through the front doors of the sanctuary and didn't even bother to go back and turn the amps off behind the stage. 

No sir.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> speaking from a super basic standpoint, the stock F-14A and the Chopper A really only differ in their maximum part slots. At level 1 the Chopper tomcat already has more available part slots than my level 13 Stock tomcat. 

Now that I've scored one of the wardog squad planes, I'm basically content with whatever rank I'm going to get from about 1-2 hours of play per day. 

If they had made this a Razgriz event...I'd probably have dumped some serious $ and time into making sure I stayed in the top ranks. 
They should have done Razgriz skin drops or something.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Arkansas is one big fucking pine forest so here I've only ever seen them leading up to big, old growth pines. 

In Texas I've seen both oak and pine about equally as much.

My uncle in Canton, TX has quite a few instances of these "steps to nowhere" but insists they were probably coupled to an old deer hunting tree stand or feeder of some sort. He's a pretty down to earth guy so I've always believed him on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Night nav, at least on the Army side, is almost idiot-proof. Unless you're at Ranger school or something similarly challenging, the instructors tend to simplify the courses as much as possible. (i.e. points lined up in long, straight lines along a power line clearing, points less than 200m apart from one another, etc.)

I've done night nav at three different posts thus far (Ft. Jackson, McClellan, Robinson) and Mac was the hardest; Insane terrain obstacles and undergrowth that easily hasn't been cleared/burned in 100+ years. 

I've never personally seen all the monsters and shit that people say they've encountered, but I'm a firm believer in the human ability to perceive whether we're being watched or threatened, without ever actually coming in contact with the threatening/observing entity. 

100% of these stories mention an uncanny "feeling of being watched" and you'll hear that in pretty much any recounting of a dangerous situation, paranormal or otherwise. If anything, humans are *really* good at knowing when something/someone is tracking on us; never discount that prickly feeling on the back of your neck as anything other than your body saying "hey, watch the fuck out, something's trying to eat us." </TEXT>

<TEXT> People die at the Ft. Rucker SERE course all the time. 
If you did your SERE in Alabama, I can absolutely vouch for you that there is strange shit in those woods.

There are patches of undergrowth so deep and dark that when you look into them, it's like looking into a void. My night land nav course at Ft. McClellan took me through an area of undergrowth that was so thick and dark I was sure I would never make it through. 

I decided it would be best to try and crawl under it to get to my next grid point, but I only got about 10 feet when I became distinctly aware that there was something in the thicket with me. I have no idea what it was, but I know something was watching me, probably waiting for me to get snagged so it could make its move. 

I backed out of the bramble and "boxed out" the obstacle and got back on course to my next point. I only needed to find 3 out of the 5 given points to pass the course, and once I got to that third point, you bet your ass I hauled it back to the start/finish as fast as I could.

There's shit out there in the dark that we don't know about, and that we don't need to go looking for.  </TEXT>

If you think I'm kidding on the second part, consult the UCMJ that governs the real world U.S. Military and you'll see that any soldier, sailor, airman, or marine that inflicts bodily damage upon themselves, whether intentionally or unintentionally, can actually be tried and punished under UCMJ laws.

<TEXT> I don't think OP has stressed this enough, but the message is pretty clear: DO NOT GO ON HIKING, CAMPING, OR BACKPACKING TRIPS ALONE. 

Always have a buddy/buddies, tell someone when you are leaving, where you are going, who else is going with you, what time/day you plan to return, and what to do/who to call if you don't come back on time. 

I don't have any particularly frightening tales from my times when I've worked at boy scout camps and roamed the Ouachita National Forest, but I do have a story to back up my statement I made above. A friend and I had planned a Spring Break backpacking trip into the Ozark Mountains along the Buffalo river valley in the western part of the state. What we failed to realize was that the weather was as bad, if not worse, than it had been the previous year, when a group of campers had been flooded, overwhelmed, and drowned by a rapid rise in the water level of the Buffalo River. 

On the second day we were out, we probably hiked around 11 miles and came to a stopping point on a well-established trail about 3/4ths of a mile from the river and atop a ridge that was easily 30 to 40 feet above the water level of the river. 

We made camp, cooked some food, and climbed into our tent for the night at around 8:45 or 9:00 PM. I woke up at about 2:30 AM freezing and wet, and realized that loose items in the tent were either completely soaked or *floating* in about 2 inches of water that had crept through the tent flap. Then I heard the rushing sound of swift water moving past our campsite no more than 30 feet from the tent. 

I got out of the tent and saw that the river had risen *at least* 25 feet in the time between us calling it a night and our startled awakening. We broke camp, gathered what trash and gear we could that wasn't submerged or actively floating away, and made for the trail head that was about a mile distant. 

This is all a very long story to make a very short point, I apologize. But when we made it back to the trail head that led to a bridge crossing the river, we realized just how much danger we had just escaped from; the river was flowing *over* the footbridge leading back to the parking area and the only place on the trail head and it's small picnic grounds that wasn't filled with water were the unisex latrine huts. My friend and I spent a very cold, damp night sleeping next to a literal shit hole, waiting for the water to recede so we could get back to my truck.

Had I been alone on the trip, like I had been planning to be originally, things could have gone very differently. I don't know if I was more alert that night because I subconsciously knew that I needed to keep my friend alive, as well as myself, but I am sure glad he was there with me, and that we told people where we were going and when we planned to be back. 

TL;DR: always have a contingency plan that will allow people to begin looking for you if you go missing in the woods. Communicate, communicate, communicate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had an absolute nutcase for a CO when I was in Alabama for OCS training. 

The guy was 6'6" and I swear sounded exactly like Forrest Gump when he talked, and he could run like the damn wind (easily a 4 or 5 minute mile pace) and could move almost completely silently in the woods. 

So, naturally, my platoon being one of the least fucked-up, he decides we need to stay up a little longer than everyone else on the last night of Night Land Nav. 

I'm sitting watch in my hasty while my battle bud sleeps (50% security suck) and suddenly this fucking face looms out at me from between two trees next to my position. All I can see is this grinning, gleeful, shining white face attached to a neck that seemed far too long to be allowed. 
I literally froze. All my life I've been relatively quick in my self-preservation sense and, up to that point, had *never* locked up in the face (literally) of sudden danger. But this motherfucker froze me exactly where I sat. 

Turns out Captain Mangum, our wacky CO, was juiced up on coffee and 5 hour energy since it was the last night of the cycle, and had decided to fuck with the platoons to see if he could nail someone for being asleep on watch or something stupid like that. He had snuck through every position and finally came to mine, where he got down on all fours and stuck his head through the trees right in front of me. I'm no night-ops expert, but I can generally hear when someone approaches me, and the moon was out and *very* bright that night and this son of a bitch walked or crawled to within 5 feet of my fighting position *in silence* before he surprised me. 

That was my experience with one fucking whacko of an officer in the National Guard; I'd imagine there are much more sinister types of people who possess the same, and probably more advanced skill set as Cpt. Mangum, but choose to employ them in more nefarious ways. I do not doubt for a second that there is *something* or *someone* that is either very old, very skilled, or both, that preys on the unsuspecting, unaware, untrained person who happens to draw their attention in the wilds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> you're misinterpreting what the term means by trying to apply the laws of conservation of momentum and energy. In no way is the force of the bullet itself going to cause a person to be "knocked down", just as the force of the firing of the bullet would never be enough to knock the firer over either. You are right in that aspect.

However, a .40 caliber round tends to have more "stopping" or "knock-down" power in that it tends to have a lower muzzle velocity and thus does not penetrate through a target like a smaller caliber, higher velocity (i.e. 9mm) will.

Simplified, this means that the .40 caliber bullet will hit a target, fragment *within* the body of the person/animal/demon, and most likely cause traumatic enough injury to slow or halt their advance.

Smaller caliber, higher velocity rounds tend to pass straight through people/animals and not inflict nearly as much physical damage. I know this because I have seen a man take x12 5.56mm (.223) rounds to the chest, arms, and abdomen, and continue running. Every one of those rounds penetrated his body and kept right on going without so much as knocking the wind out of him.

A .40, .44 magnum, or .45 caliber round *will* drop the fleshy target you fire it at, so long as it isn't a bear or a moose or some shit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> .40 caliber has more knock down power than the 9 mil.

9mil will penetrate just about anything, but if I'm going to shoot something that's running, jumping or advancing on me, I don't want to scare it, I want to put it on the fucking *ground*. 

.45 is not for the faint of heart, but .40 ammo is right around the same price point as 9mm and equally accessible at local sporting good shops. Both calibers are reasonably well-suited to the beginner shooter and will do the job well enough, if you're in a dangerous spot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd really like to talk to some of the other various teachers who have taught in B210. But, seeing as most of them are significantly older than Mrs. Roberts was at the time, I doubt I'd get much from them. Older folks tend to repress a lot of things and are extremely good at withholding the truth out of some misguided sense of pride, protection, or fear.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There have been a few questions that some of you seem to need to know. Here's my guesses, which are the best I can do for now.

-I graduated in 2009 and since that year, the ELA (English Language Arts) Faculty has remained the same with zero turnover other than Mrs. Roberts. 

-When I entered RHS as a freshman in 2005, the ELA staff had been the same for at least the previous 22 years, as ALL of the teachers I encountered in my tenure there were the same ones that appeared in my older brother's yearbook from when he attended the same school.

-This leads me to the assumption that any ELA teacher who gets hired at RHS does not leave. Either from some kind of unspoken support code, or because of some contractual obligation.

-The room where Jeremy's suicide occurred is B210, the room where Mrs. Roberts taught English 2-3.

-As far as I know, nothing dangerous has occurred nor has any student or teacher been harmed in the classroom since Jeremy's death there in 1991. I guess Mrs. Roberts could see him though, and I cant imagine how horrific that must have been on a daily basis. I think I would break too. 

-There was a slight misunderstanding about the means by which I went about getting Mrs. Roberts fired. She and I never had sex. All it took was my reporting that she attempted to force herself on me in the parking lot and her admission that she had been attempting to solicit sex with me, and she was done. I know she was married, but I had never met, much less seen, her husband, and I don't really know what happened there. I have never seen her again. 

I don't know that I have much else to write about concerning this subject, so I doubt there will be a part 2. Unless you want me to hash out in detail how the process of her getting fired went. The story ends there, but if you want to know more about Jeremy, I suggest you go to the source: the ELA department at Richardson High School.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Pearl Jam song "Jeremy" is about my school. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-27 17:10:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Do you all remember that Pearl Jam song called *Jeremy*? 
It's about a real person, and a real event that happened at my high school.

Eddie Vedder wrote the anthem of misunderstood youth after reading a newspaper article about a student who shot himself in front of his classroom peers and teacher on January, 8th 1991.

I won't get too much into the backstory, but Jeremy Delle had a lot of problems. Whatever was going on in his life, it was probably really tough. 

I feel so bad that my school literally has his blood on their hands. 

Trying to get anyone on the staff to admit that, though, is another thing entirely. 
******

I had a bit of a reputation for being an explorer around the school. I was in three band or music classes every semester and always had a long lunch, leaving me plenty of time to discover the 100+ year old building that comprised Richardson High School. I probably went in a lot of doors I wasnt allowed through and searched through a lot of rooms I shouldnt have, but damn did I know almost every inch of that campus. Made for a lot of good, private make-out sessions with any of my various girlfriends during my high school tenure. 

What I never found though, was any shred of the memory of Jeremy Delle. There were no memorials, no tributes, no plaques on the walls. Not even a brick outside in the A courtyard that has his name on it, and there's a *lot* of names etched out there. I couldn't find him. 

It took me two more years of hunting, sweet-talking teachers, and curt grunts from old staff members to even get anyone to admit he'd gone to school there. 

Then one day I caught my 4th period English teacher crying after class. 

I played pranks on her to no end, but never in a malicious way, and just that day had reversed the contents of her desktop and drawers in an attempt to throw her out of her robotronic teacher routine. They never worked, the pranks, and Im certain she always knew I was the perpetrator, but I made sure I did my work well, and I actually liked her as a person. So when I saw her crying, slumped in her seat between classes, I was truly worried I had crossed a line. 

Mrs. Roberts, Im sorry I pulled that on you today. I should have been in my seat, working, not messing with your stuff while you were out of the room, I apologized. 

Its fine, Sean, she sniffed, if I couldnt handle pranks from teenagers, I probably shouldnt have chosen this career.

Yeah, I guess so. Are you alright?, I asked. 

She straightened up a little, Yes and no. This class is just overwhelming at times, and I feel like I need to escape, but then at the same time I have a duty to every student who sets foot in here.

No matter what age you are, hearing an authoritative adult admit theyre having a hard time is always tough for a kid to comprehend. Here was one of my most respectable, knowledgable teachers telling me that she might be in over her head with us students. 

Butwhy? It was just English class; nothing incredible ever happened, save for my pranks, and she always seemed more than capable of handling all of us, even at our most foolish. 
I did notice that she often left the room during the period to go check on something, but always chalked that up to her looking in on another class or checking the microwave to see if her lunch was done or something. 

I guess I stood there a little too long without speaking, internalizing this dialogue in my head, and she busted my thought bubble, asking, Is there anything else?

She stood up from her desk and began trying to wipe away a stain on the chalk board with a wet rag.

Oh, no, maam. Sorry I spaced out there. Sorry again for messing with you today. I hope you have a better day. See you tomorrow., and I headed for the door. 

Apology accepted. And please leave the door open when you go. Please., she smiled. 
*****
By the next semester, I had pretty much given up the whole Jeremy thing. I had scored this exceedingly attractive girl named Meagan as a serious girlfriend and we spent a lot of time in the hidden places Id discovered over the past two years. 

Mrs. Roberts didnt show up to class for the first week and a half, and we never had a substitute stay more than a day with us. We didnt get anything done for a solid eight days, and it was awesome; no grades, no homework, just sit there, dont get crazy, free period, basically. 

But when I heard the Thursday sub say, Your teacher will be back with you tomorrow, I kind of wilted but was honestly a glad to have Mrs. R back; something way down deep in me needed stability and consistency. 

Friday came and went and I think we did some kind of reading assignment and then had a class discussion over To Kill a Mockingbird. Mrs. R seemed okay, but looked extremely tired and her eyes were always very quickly shifting from the black board to the back of the class, where I sat, and back again. I chalked it up to her being nervous about me pulling some kind of jack-assery on her first day back and made sure I was attentive and not disruptive of her class. I felt it was the least I could do. 

At 4:10 that afternoon, I was walking to my car to go home when, out of nowhere, this blur of floral print, high heels, and too much eyeshadow came flying at me and pinned me to Trevor Hodges Jeep Cherokee. Hands groped my neck and chest and I felt hot breath *very* close to my lips. 

Just kiss me, Sean.

What the fuck? 

Up to that point I was thinking Meagan had attacked me in a frenzy of hormonal, teenage lust. Hearing Mrs. Roberts voice accompanying the volley of sensation threw the brakes on the freight train of adrenaline pumping through my veins. 

Holy shit, lady. What are you doing?, I coughed.

I have to do this. It has to be you., she sobbed.

I pried her off of me. Even at 16, I was still a good three inches taller than her, and I guess I never realized how truly feminine and fragile she was; Meagan easily had 15 pounds on her, even though I remembered my teacher being healthy-looking and full-bodied for as long as I had known her.

Mrs. Roberts, please dont touch me again, I said, still trying to calm myself down, and what do you mean it has to be me?

You wanted to know, didnt you? It was you asking all the questions, trying to pry the lock off the schools past, right? How many teachers told you to go away, or to quit asking about something you had no right to know? How many?! She was shouting at me now, her desperation bubbling over.

I cant go back in that room. I wont. Youre going to make sure I dont step foot in this school again. Ever. 

Astonished, the only thing I could get out was, What? Howwhy?

She backed up from me and looked me squarely in the eye. 

You wanted to know why we dont talk about Jeremy. Why we dont honor him with some kind of memorial or moment of silence. Her tone was deadly serious.

I mean, yeah, I gue-, I started, but she cut me off. 

Jeremy never left, and she visibly shuddered. If she didnt already have my full attention, she sure as shit had it now. 

The last thing that happened before Jeremy shot his head off in front of everyone was that an English teacher wrote him up for being late to class and sent him to the office. He left and came back with a gun. He hasnt left the classroom since then.

I could tell she wasnt fucking with me. As I studied her, I started to notice how thin her hair looked, how really very slight she had become, how her eyes werent just tired, but completely exhausted. 

Mrs. R, I dont understand. What do you mean Jeremy never left?, I asked. I already knew the answer, but I had to hear her say it.

Every time you pulled a prank on me, every time you sat in the back and messed around, I would look up to make eye contact, but it wasnt you I was looking at, she said as tears started to fall.

It was him. The grey hoodie, the blood pouring from his nose. And that stain. That *fucking* stain.

The one on the blackboard

Miss, I d-dont un-understand, I sputtered.

DONT YOU GET IT?, she screamed, *EVERY* English teacher who gets assigned that class is in Hell. For 16 years theyve told any teacher that uses that room they are *required* to accommodate any and all students, past or present, who set foot in the room.

A horrific light bulb went off in my head. 

So, I not only have to deal with *your* shit, but, she started to break down. Literally. I saw her just begin to fold where she stood, sinking down to the concrete in a mess of wet hair and scuffed heels and floral print. She sat there for a moment, recomposing herself. 

I knelt down in front of her. What do you need me to do?

She looked up and said, softly, I need you to get me fired. 

Okay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Enjoyed that one too, sir. Just finished reading. 
AC4 is a great story and I guess I never really bothered to consider the events from Mobius 1's point of view. I personally never inserted myself fully into that character, as I've always been more interested in the relationship between Yellow 13 and 4. For me, the most tragic moment comes from a simple order at the end of a hectic mission: "Eject, Yellow 4". I think at that point Mobius 1 defeated 13 and it was all just a matter of time from then on. 

Great writing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> YOOOOOOO figured out some stuff about this game. 

I had no idea that all the "parts research" I was getting and all the parts I was "procuring" weren't actually being applied to my F-14A. I went into the aircraft editing screen and realized that I needed to actually *equip* the parts I have been unlocking. My Tomcat was already at level 9, and I was faring pretty well with it as an absolutely stock, unmodified fighter, but now that I've upgraded it with parts and bumped it to level 10...mannnn this thing rocks. 

I'm super new to this and figuring everything out on my own. I did *something* today (completed a challenge, I guess?) and now suddenly have 32 stocked fuel. Not sure exactly what I did, but it was a nice reward. 

I've been trying to get in rooms with only 4-6 players so I can guarantee myself points and not just be battling 7 other people the whole time for lock-on's and shit. 

I've gotten quite a few "drop" planes, like the Mickey F-14, Shin F-5, Kim AV-8B, and the Sulejmani MiG, but don't really want to stray away from my Tomcat as 1) I really enjoy using it, and, 2) I don't want to be bothered with leveling another aircraft. But that mentality could change based on your suggestions

Is there anything else I can be doing to start scoring progressively higher? I feel like I've found my identity in this game as far as what I excel at, but do I need to start doing more all-around to really get the "elite" experience? 
Also, are there any "skins" for the standard F-14A that I could possibly get hold of? I'm cool with the stock look as it is, but it would be neat to have an option there for alternate paint. 

Let me know what you think. 


Here's the setup for my F-14A

<TEXT> Alright, played three rounds last night in the F-4E. Basic beginner stuff.
Woke up this morning and played another three rounds and unlocked the F-14A, my favorite plane of all time. 
Also got my first "drop" (I guess that's what it's called?) of an AV-8B with the "Kim" skin. I guess I'm not high enough level to access it though. 

Went and grabbed a new controller a few minutes ago but the battery is totally dead so now I'm stuck waiting for it to charge.
This is all pretty exciting; I don't think I've ever truly looked forward to getting online and playing a game before. I usually play offline and solo, but this is a pretty cool thing that Bamco has going on!.

You don't have a specific "buddy" in that game but holy s***bucket are the AI amazing at either not helping you at all, or dying as soon as possible. I swear at least 20 of them die PER MISSION, if you count the number of "I'm hit! Ejecting!" messages that get transmitted over friendly comms. That's a pretty severe squadron turnover rate. By the time you reach Megalith Omega and Halo squads have likely blown through at least 3 generations of pilots ALL WITHIN THE SAME CONFLICT. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, Chopper went down in such an honorable way- you know, concerned about the lives of others- that it honestly didn't feel all that bad. 

Four, though, was definitely more tragic, in my eyes, because there's a LOT that can be read into the "eject" order that 13 gives her:
-He obviously saw her get hit and had eyes on her as she likely lost control.
-He really thought she could get out in time.

<TEXT> yeah I really believed the cards were corrupted and actually just ordered two brand new 128 MB cards as replacements, but, lo and behold, I reset the system clock and -poof- everything came right back. 

I put ACZ in today and was promptly thrown into the last B7R fight against Sorcerer Team and had a hell of a time figuring that fight out again after probably 3 years of absence from the game. 

I need to find a good screenshot of the Razgriz demon when it's pictured in *A Blue Dove for the Princess*; I think that representation is equal parts elegant and intimidating, which is my kind of style.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sly, I definitely read that today. I got my PS2 up and working again after realizing what was wrong with all my memory cards; because I had unplugged and moved my console, the time settings reset themselves to 00:00 12/31/99 and the entire thing was literally frozen in place, waiting for me to re-up the clock. Once I reset the time, BAM all my save files came back.

I played through AC5 on Monday and Tuesday, and made it through ACZ on expert today. I'll keep going on ACZ so I can get that 100% complete for the Assault Records. 

This is kind of an aside, but goes along with how strongly I feel about this series: 

I have a friend who loved his Pokemon Red team so much that he got a tattoo of the mon who used the final move to defeat Gary/Blue/Assface. My buddy has a SUPER detailed Poliwrath on his shoulder because of how much he loved that team. I'm seriously considering either a Razgriz or Galm related tattoo as my next ink.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What bothers me the most about Blaze is how easily he gets relegated to trail position duty in high-profile or stress situations. Like, they try to make Edge the flight lead initially, right? And then in November City, it's Edge flying in the 1 position for the aerobatics display. It bugs the crap out of me that Blaze gets so easily bumped to the side when he's supposed to be this ultimate badass of the skies. We don't REALLY hear the squad mates start swooning over him until Aces when Grimm and Snow start fan-boying over him so hard that the ground guys probably got uncomfortable. 

Each protagonist is a total badass in their own right, but the Demon Lord was the only one anyone really talked about truly being afraid of. Thus, my pick.  </TEXT>

The first time I realized that 4 was back-tracking across the same geography where 2 took place, it was like a literal brain-melt scenario. I was 10 years old realizing that my games interconnected with one another and was so excited to tell my parents about it that I think I woke them up out of bed. They didn't care though, so that's kinda where the story ends.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where do I even begin?
Firstly: Thank god, reddit truly has something for everyone. I almost jumped up and down when I saw there was an AC subreddit. 

This is going to get SUPER sappy, and most of you ACI kids probably don't give a f*** about what I'm going to talk about, but some of you old aces will know exactly my feels.

My parents bought me a Playstation when I was 6. It was the first really nice thing I ever had. My dad picked out the games, so naturally he bought stuff based on the things that I loved: NASCAR and airplanes. NASCAR 99 was my first foray into the EA s***show and never was much more fun than driving the wrong way around the track and smashing into other cars head on. 
The airplane game, however, turned out to probably be the best thing my Dad has ever done for me. It was Ace Combat 2. He probably went to a game store and asked the guy at the counter, "what's the best airplane game you've got?", and walked out with AC2 in hand. 
I remember having absolutely no idea what to do when I first played it because I didn't read the instruction manual, and there was no tutorial phase; the game just dumped you into GAMB IT and said "hey, see those bombers? yeah, shoot those". But holy hell did it feel amazing the first time I figured out how to catch up, lock on to, and nail that first B-52. And then the word BINGO flashed across the screen and I was hooked from then on. 
I remember when the first named ace popped up in the game and my 6 year old brain thinking "why is that one different?". I think right then was when I developed my desire for games to be deeper than just pressing X or A and seeing bright flashing lights on the screen. 

Jump forward 4 years and I'm 10 getting AC4 for Christmas. I didn't get a real chance to experience Electrosphere because the US release was absolutely dumbed down to the point of vomit, like we all know, and I think I demo'd it at Blockbuster (if you know what that is, congrats, we're old) and was not impressed. 
But yeah, AC4 gets popped in and, again, holy hell there's a story now? A narrator experiencing all this action from below and making it a real, human tale of survival and growth? The game itself also probably spawned my preference for games with a lot of communication; all the radio chatter, briefings, and narration really made it more of an interactive movie than a game, at least to me. 

Then there's AC5: the game that ruined all other games for me.

I guess 5 came out like 3 years after 4 and I think in that interim period I sort of, again, lost interest in the series, although I played 4 regularly with my older brother when my parents would let me stay at his house. I think the first time I saw that 5 was coming out was probably in some sort of gaming magazine, and it had a website link to the official game site. Once I saw there was another AC game coming out AND that it had a Tomcat on the cover art, I probably checked the website every day to find out the release date and if they'd post any pictures of game content or whatever. 

The weekend it came out, I walked 3 and a half miles from my house to gamestop to go buy the game. I got home, put it in tray of the PS2, and was promptly spoiled to the point of ruination by easily the best game ever produced for that console. Forgive my fan-boying here, but what other flight-based, large-scale war game can, at once, tell a story that is equal parts dramatic, intriguing, fascinating, and engaging, AND be backed up by state-of-the-art game play and graphics. Not only that, but the campaign was easily the longest I'd played of ANY game (and I survived the original Spyro) thus far in my gaming experience. 
The campaign is almost 30 missions right? I think the other AC games up to that point (US only) had probably had a max of 16-20, so AC5 definitely felt like a damn saga. Plus the CG animation and all that made it pretty cool. To this day, I still feel like a badass when people ask me to do something and I reply with, "Sure thing" in that sly, I-know-something-you-don't 8492 way. 

All that, and then they paint the damn airplanes black and start calling you a ghost and suddenly you're the hottest thing with two wings. 

Throughout all this, I never met a single person who played the games, much less anybody who enjoyed them as much as I did. Up until about 2 years ago, I was firmly convinced that I was probably one of only a VERY few people who dove into the AC world the way I had. 

I don't remember buying ACZ, but it was equally engaging and is most likely the reason why I enjoy documentary-based war stories. To me, there is nothing better than a story told from the perspective of those who were there. 
ACZ introduced me to the idea that war isn't this glorious thing. I guess at that time the US was pretty caught up in all the Iraq stuff and I think I learned the lesson that the guys in the pilot seats, and the guys behind all those big guns weren't necessarily super excited to have to do that kind of job. ACZ was short, but I think the World With No Boundaries thing really proved a big point in the series and in real life as well, at least for me. 

By the way, Galm 1 is the baddest dude to ever fly the StrangeReal skies. You're free to believe what you want though, as to who's the best. Just remember the plaque for the alternates is in the ladies' room. 

AC6 was a blessing in disguise at a point where the Xbox 360 almost became a bookend. It is SERIOUSLY inferior to the other games, but 
I was very glad to see a next gen console installment of my favorite series. Even to this day I'm not sure I've ever fully sat through the horrifically boring cutscenes in 6, but the gameplay was always a lot of fun and it's the easiest game I've ever gotten 100% completion on. Plus, that almost inaudible tidbit of enemy chatter during Chandelier- you know the one..."Galm 1, shoot down the enemy ace..."- just cements my opinion of this series being the best EVER. I mean you don't even see him- there's not a Strike Eagle-C to be found on that map- but damn if hearing that name didn't make you go, "Oh s***, not him!". And all of that because some writer somewhere at Namco had the brilliant insight to write in one little snippet of easter egg dialogue. 

I bought AH because I was under the impression that it would be like any other game in the series. Boy was I wrong about that. Won't even go into how disappointing it is to see Strangereal thrown by the wayside in favor of marketing the game to CoD and BF audiences who will never fully appreciate the original series games. 


As for ACI, I can't stay connected to the game for more than about 10 minutes and it seems to be overrun with high level users who hang out in low level matches and just wreck dick on everyone. Makes it really un-fun. Plus, free-to-play, shouldn't mean that you have to pay to be able to enjoy the game. That's a whole other can of beans though. 

I guess what I'm saying is, thank you to the people who created this game series and thanks to all those Aces out there who taught me what it means to truly love something. 

I stand by what Project Aces says about these games:

<TEXT> I remember when AC5 came out in '04. I was in 7th grade and waited all summer for the game to come out after having waited 4 years since AC4. 
Shattered Skies was SO great, especially since I had played the mostly-silent AC2 and not been able to play (or even understand) the foreign version of AC3. When AC5 was announced and the release date revealed, I probably checked the game website every day to see new pictures and game content; It was the first thing I ever fully "nerded out" over. Plus, I grew up on Top Gun and when I saw the cover art was a Tomcat with a carrier and an exploding ship behind it, well, shit, that did it for me.
The day the game released was in the middle of the week so I had to wait til the weekend, and when saturday rolled around I walked like 3 and a half miles to gamestop to go buy it. 
Playing it was THE MOST fulfilling thing I'd ever experienced. Not only was it a huge step up in gameplay with new features and graphics, but it was LONG; the campaign is almost 30 missions right? AC5 was my first ever truly satisfying gaming experience and it absolutely spoiled me with so many things: depth of universe, diversity of storytelling, imagination, etc. 
I am SO glad to have been a fan of this franchise for the past 20 years.

<TEXT> Whoever you are, I want more of the stories you're telling. I don't think I've met anyone thus far in my life who seems to have the same predilection toward getting TOTALLY immersed in these games. I've been playing this series since I was 6 years old; I'm 24 now and still get the same satisfaction and pride out of assuming the roles of each protagonist. I've lived whole lives through these games that I'll never even begin to replicate in the real world. It pains me deeply that Namco/Bandai chose to move away from StrangeReal in favor of capturing the CoD/BF audiences' attention, and I sincerely hope that some programmer, somewhere deep within the bowels of Namco, steps up to his bosses and asks to resurrect the world I loved so much. 
For me, Ace Combat is it, and fully lives up to the Project Aces moniker: Nothing Else Comes Close.  </TEXT>

****

I ran.

I dropped my car keys and ran.

Theres a lot to be said for the strength of the flight option when faced with a fight/flight scenario; I dont think Ive ever run so fast in my life.

Wheeling on the spot, I booked it out of the church parking lot and into the dark two lane street. There wasnt a light, a car, a person, to be seen or heard in any direction. As fast as my feet and adrenaline could carry me, I pounded ground in the direction of home. Logic now screams at me that I probably couldnt have been safe from this thing anywhere that I went, but at the time home seemed the most safe and secure locale I could think of.

Then everything got weird.

Have you ever heard a battery operated cassette player run out of charge in the middle of a tape? Or maybe heard a turntable play a record at too slow of RPM? Those examples are the only way I can describe what happened as I beat feet away from the roaring monstrosity that I was sure had to have taken up in pursuit of me. As I ran, the echo of my footsteps, the ragged noise of my breathing, and the hum of the power lines over head all seem to slow down and drop in pitch. Sounds became deep, rumbling and prolonged, as if stretched and pulled like so much dough.

I then became aware that this aural curiosity applied itself physically to my surroundings; the wind appeared to be rustling the trees in slow motion and the clouds traveling across the night sky suddenly froze in their place. I was still running, still exerting myself against the horror that I was sure was at my heels, but I wasnt getting anywhere. I swear I sprinted for a good 20 seconds before realizing that I hadnt made any progress further up the street.

It was at this point that I felt sure I was finished. The dark figure with the horrific voice had spilled the wind from my sheets by denying me the opportunity to flee. It hadnt cornered me, and, in fact, had allowed me to put some distance between us when it sprang its trap. With the world pinned in place, I had nowhere to go. My exhaustion and terror caught up with me simultaneously and I collapsed to my knees in the middle of the road.

The steady THUD THUD THUD of footsteps behind me spoke to the close presence of my pursuer. Whether it had actually chased me this far I wasnt sure, but I could again feel malice like breaking waves across my back.

I mentioned before the exchange student who surprised me with his vocal ability to produce multiple pitches at once. The thing standing over me spoke with at least 7 different, distinct voices in varying registers. And the sound, the overall texture of its speechlike shattering glass and bomb blasts and screaming and the ripping of flesh and molten hate all piped through the same tube.

You hear well, it hissed.

Yes, I replied.

Be my ears, it commanded.

No.

Do you value your existence?, it asked.

Yes.

Be. My. Ears.

No.

Look at me.

I looked up from where I had been staring straight into the asphalt pavement.

Theres no easy way to put this. I looked up into a mouth. Crouching before me was a beast of muscle and brawn with nothing but a mouth for a face. No eyes or nose, just a massive mouth filled with sharpened teeth.

Again it spoke, and I watched as the oversized, forked tongue carefully crafted each syllable inside its horrible, cavernous jaw.

There are others who have pledged to be my eyes. You will be my ears.

It began to circle me as it talked, every step like a sledgehammer falling against the earth.

Your ears will seek out what I want to know.

No, I wont, I spat.

If you will not, then I WILL MAKE YOU BLEED.

The threat was supported in its viciousness by a blast of rotten wind that slammed me on my face against the rough pavement.

With no hope for escape, no chance of ever being free from this evil, I urged it do to the only thing I knew it would gladly enjoy.

Kill me.

In the most loathsome, foul, chuckling whisper, it said, Oh noyou will bleed. And I will have my ears.

Pain seared through my left forearm as I felt the monster hoist me up. I stared into the void of its mouth as it dragged a single claw-like finger nail the length of my arm. Blood began to pour from the wound, and the bubbling chuckle returned.

Your kind is so predisposed to bleeding. Its what you do naturally. You will all bleed. In time.
****

I woke up in the ER. Someone found me laying in the middle of the street half a block from my house, bleeding from a deep gash in my arm. I told them I was depressed and drank too much and must have wandered outside. I said I guessed I cut myself on some broken glass and then passed out when I saw the blood.

None of those things are true. Im not squeamish. Im not depressed. I cant stand the taste of alcohol for more than a few drinks, and I never walk the streets alone at night in this city. Or at least I damn sure wont anymore.

The stitches wont hold in my arm. Every time the doctor puts more in, they melt. The raw wound stinks and burns, but thats not what Im most concerned about.

There is something with us, right here, right now.

It calls with bells in the night.

And it wants to see us bleed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part 1) https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3fl9ra/the_bells_are_wrong_1/

I said already that Little Rock can get country quiet at night. Another of its charming, albeit unsettling, qualities is that it can also get unnaturally dark for a typical urban hub. As I pulled into the church parking lot, I couldnt help but feel like the light was not going to be my friend this night. 

The church was an old one-building affair with a columned entranceway, a steeply angled roof, and a tall, imposing bell tower attached to its side. In the dark it looked like a wide mouthed beast with one arm stretched toward the sky. 

Up until the point where I exited my car, I could hear the bells screeching their uncharacteristic moans as I drove nearer the church. As soon as I opened my door, they abruptly ceased. Uneasy silence and darkness stabbed my senses like a hot poker and put me on an animalistic instinctive edge; I hate saying this because I know it comes off as total cheese, but believe me when I say that nothing good comes from the dark and quiet (except food from the refrigerator). 

I wont mince words here or do anything but state the next thing that happened: I saw someone standing on the front steps of the church in front of the open, gaping, pitch black entry way. 

The Army combat guys I work with talk all the time about their spider senses tingling in the moments just before a dangerous situation springs up; the person standing in that doorway physically made my flesh crawl. From the split second I locked onto that figure in front of the church, I knew instinctively that it was going to hurt me. 

It stood about 6 foot 5 inches tall and had the build of a stout man with chin length hair. Menace dripped from it and seemed to roll over me in waves. I imagined (?) that I could smell its hungry longing to shred me. In my life Ive been in like two definite situations where I knew, if I didnt do something proactive to ensure my safety, I was going to die. This was one of those times. 

A sibilant hiss issued from the bell tower above us as whatever-it-was and I stared one another down. Then it opened its mouth. 

****
Forgive me for digressing away from the timeline of events here, but I feel that I need to preface the last portion of what Im going to tell you. 

When something large, menacing, dark, threatening, etc., locks onto you, its typically not a good idea to stay around to find out whats going to happen. But fuck me if I didnt, for who knows what reason, stay firmly locked into my spot next to my car. Thisthing bore into me with such an intensity that I could not rip myself away from its gaze. And as it opened its mouth, I found myself almost eager to experience its voice

In my experiences with music, tonality, synesthesia, and absolute pitch, never have I once been confused or blanked by anything Ive heard. Sure, Ive listened to some avant garde shit that jumped around the tonal spectrum like someone dropped a ping pong ball inside a piano (three guesses as to which composer), and Ive heard some voicings in compositions that sounded like someone took a bucket of poorly mixed paint and threw it at a wall, but never once was I truly confounded by, and surely was I never afraid of, any sound Ive ever heard. 

Until this fucking thing. 
****

I cant even begin to describe the noise this god damned thing made. There isnt a name for what came out of its mouth. And the only color to describe its quality is whatever color the void is. Deepest black. Black of the infinite. I dont fucking know. 

This thing, this monstrosity, this amalgam of every nightmare had by every person in the history of humanity, roared with its full might as I stood helpless against its tirade. 

Just when I thought I could bear no more and would surely crumble to dust under the assault of its voice, the sound cut off. Silence like a vacuum enveloped us. 

And then, suddenly, as if to shatter the earth, it bellowed one word:

BLEED </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a rare, unusual, and mostly useless gift: Absolute pitch. 

What this means is that I can identify the note name of any given pitch I hear or audiate. For example, if you were to sing me any pitch of your choosing, I could tell you its note name and how out of tune (sharp/flat) it is. I could go into a ton of detail about pitch referencing, memorization, the way music is considered in tune, etcetera, but then this would post would turn into a college thesis paper and Ive already fucking done that enough for a lifetime. 

Because of my condition, I observe the world in a slightly different manner. My hearing ability is in no way super or over powered; all my ability allows me to do is put a definite label on any pitched sounds I may hear on a daily basis. Its a really sweet trick to pull out at boring parties, and, for some reason, people get a huge kick out of thinking they can stump me by singing as high, low, or out of tune as they possibly can. I can assure you, 10 times out of 10, I will correctly identify any pitch I hear, man-made, or electronic in nature. 

The only time anyone has ever caught me by surprise was a foreign-exchange student from Australia who had spent time in Bhutan and learned the art of throat-singing whereby he could produce multiple pitches simultaneously. I wasnt shocked at hearing something incorrectly as much as I was caught off guard because he didnt tell me what he was going to do. Hearing essentially three voices come out of a person is sort of a kick in the nuts for someone like me. 

I wish I could say that was the last time I experienced something like that. 

I live in Little Rock, Arkansas. No matter if this place feels like a big city, it still gets country-quiet at night. Quiet enough to hear church bells and chimes for miles, some nights. 

The Episcopal church a mile from my house has a super distinct set of bells that they love to set off for any number of occasions. Saturdays in Summer are extremely popular for weddings and as the happy couple exits the church on the way to the rest of their lives, those bells scream joy and good tidings for the whole neighborhood to hear. 
The bells produce a beautiful, yellowish tone (I also associate sounds with colors due to a condition called Synesthesia), and are keyed in C Major. C Major is viewed traditionally as the purest in music, in that it is a completely natural key; there are no sharps or flats in its key signature. 

Last night I was coming home from a late night Sonic breakfast burrito run when I pulled into my driveway. As I fumbled for my keys, trying to find the tattered one that unlocks my even-more tattered duplex, I heard the bells ring out from Hillcrest Episcopal down the road. As soon as the first tones hit my ears, the equivalent of an air raid siren went off in my mind; something about those tones was horribly awry. 

Instead of the yellow purity of C Major echoing off the houses in my hilly neighborhood, the bells belched in a grinding, soul wrenching Gb (read: G flat) that was as out of tune as it was out of character. Almost a quarter-tone sharp, and an augmented 4th above their normal tonal center, the bells may as well have been a bomb blast to my psyche. An augmented 4th or diminished 5th is known colloquially in Western music as the Tri Tone and, even to the untrained ear, is one of the most jarring musical intervals that exists in the scalar form. Older composers from the renaissance period commonly referred to the tri tone as the devils interval. Sounds like old superstition and religious fervor right?  

Im not so sure anymore.

Thoroughly unnerved, I did exactly the opposite of what, in hindsight, I should have done: I got in my car and backed out of the driveway, intent on finding out what was wrong with those bells.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Dad works night shift at Edwards AFB at the AFRL (Air Force Rocket Lab). He's seen some stuff out in the desert out there, undetermined if man-made, military, or "something else", that he hasn't quite been able to explain. He's called me a few nights and asked stuff like "what's shaped like a slanted parallelogram, 2 miles wide, and can maintain sustained flight at less than 50 mph?"
I've always thought he might be messing with me or hinting at something he knows they have out there, but I think he's genuinely asking me what I think these things could be. 
Whether we (i.e. human beings) are building these things or "something else" is, I certainly believe there are air and space craft that travel our skies on a regular basis that we are not meant to know about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My older brother, Rob, had an exceedingly rough life. From the time he was born until the day he died I would not hesitate to say that he lived "the struggle". At the time of his death, he had only been living with my family for around 3 months. He had previously been serving a 3+ year prison sentence for third-strike DUI (it was actually more like his fifth, but whatever). 
Since returning to our house, he had participated in family events much more frequently, attended church with us regularly, and begun making new friends in a support group. His death that night was totally unexpected and almost uncharacteristic of him; he had not used "hard" drugs for almost ten years. 
Whatever he was going through, it happened in silence and secrecy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> thanks for the kind thoughts. 
I think my main point here is that my family was lied to about the way my brothers experienced their deaths. 
The pain, terror, and sadness I felt on those nights were, I think, what they were going through at the time. 
It's something I'll keep with me until it's my turn to go.
I'm glad there's not another brother left to experience whatever I will go through.
And I'll never tell my Mom about these feelings. She can't know what her boys went through. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have two half-brothers. Well, I had two half-brothers. Their names were Robert and James. Robert was born 20 years before me, when my mother was 21 years old. I was born when she was 41, and James was born 3 years later. You could consider James and me to be pretty lucky to exist at all; pregnancies at such a late age can be extremely high-risk and often don't end with a healthy or viable birth.

Anyway, we all had different Dads and thus didn't spend a lot of time with one another growing up. Imagine having two brothers and still living like an only child. It made for odd relationships with one another, but we still loved each other as brothers do. In other words, we were tight despite our circumstances.


Now I'm the only one left.

On the night Rob died, I had been out with friends to see a movie and then spent the night away from home. I was 16 at the time and had just started dating a girl name Stephanie who was a year older than me and very pretty. She had a gigantic friend group and for some reason, they accepted me immediately as if they had known me for years. She was also gorgeous. A dark movie theater with a hot girl and a bunch of new friends? The night seemed like it would be one of the best I'd ever had. 

Until 10:45 pm. 

Right as the movie was getting to its most climatic point, I suddenly felt an intense feeling of terror wash over me. Unexplainable, pure, agonizing terror. I felt like I was in a car stuck on train tracks, watching the locomotive come around the bend. The feeling of joy and contentment was replaced with the sensation that someone had just hit me full-force in the chest with a baseball bat. I felt like I wanted to die. 

I slept poorly that night.

The next morning I awoke to a phone call from my Dad who was working overseas in Saudi Arabia. My brother, Robert, was dead. 
At some point in the night, Rob had either asphyxiated himself, or aspirated his own vomit and died. My Mom found him in my old room, face up on the floor, gone. 

For as long as I can remember, that room was a source of fear for me. On dark nights I always got the strong sense that something was watching from inside the room. I had nightmares of a gigantic black hand reaching out from the doorway to grab at me as I walked by. The double closet doors in the room would sometimes stick tightly closed, and other times (often at night) swing open and loudly crash against the walls. But, more than anything else, there was always an overwhelming sense of dread whenever I was alone in that room. Like it hated me for being there. 
Needless to say, I slept on the couch a lot. I think it was the worst place my brother could have been that night.

Rob Mason was declared DOA at Baylor Dallas hospital on the morning of January 16th, 2007. The coroners said my brother overdosed on heroin, which caused him to pass out and vomit. Because he passed out face up, he aspirated the vomit into his lungs and drowned in his own fluids. They said he never felt a thing from the time he passed out. 


I don't believe them. 

*****

On the night of June 21st, 2013, I was on CQ duty at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina. With me that night was my buddy Logan. The soldiers in Bravo Company, 2/13th Infantry, were all asleep in their bunks after a hard day of training. Logan and I, alone, were the only ones up and active in the building. We had armed all the door alarms, checked all the latrines for late night snackers (soldiers think if they eat in the dark, they won't get caught), and done our headcounts of each platoon. Everyone was where they were supposed to be. Some guys were still awake, dicking around with flashlights and whispering quiet, immature jokes to one another, but everybody in that company was under their covers in bed. 

At 3 AM the door between 1st and 2nd platoons slammed open but the alarm didn't go off. I was sitting in a chair at the CQ desk and leaned back to look down the hall toward the door, thinking our CO or an NCO from one of the other companies was trying to catch us sleeping on duty. 

What I saw was something I wasn't properly trained to handle. 

Standing at the threshold of the door between the two platoon areas was a combat soldier in full kit (we call it battle-rattle in the Army). His helmet was on, his rifle slung across his chest, and his head hung low so I couldn't make out his face. 
His FLC and vest were neatly squared-away; everything taped up and orderly, unlike most BCT privates who generally always look like they got hit by a bus. 

He just stood there. 

He looked tired. At this point in our training, we were eight weeks in, with four left to go. We'd been sweating in the Carolina heat for months and were only just now starting to get some privileges back. 

Now here was this yahoo who was NOT one of my company-mates, obviously kitted up as some kind of punishment for fucking up at something-or-other, and he's walking into my company area like a damned zombie. 

I had started to get up from the desk to walk over to this kid. Patrol of the battalion area in full battle-rattle wasn't an uncommon punishment, so I figured he was somebody from another company and just making his rounds before heading back to bed in one of the other barracks. 

"Hey dude, what company are you from?", I asked.

The guy in the door didn't answer my question.

Now Logan was beside me, "Yo, fuckin' wake up, soldier. What do you need?"

The whole time we stood there in the hallway, this guy had been looking down at his feet, kinda with that mopey, sleepy, "aw shucks" feel about him. 

Now he looked up at us.

In the dim light of the emergency floods at either end of the corridor, I still couldn't make out his face. Try as I might, it was just too dark to read out a name tape or see who this dude could be. He wasn't locked and loaded or anything (no magazine in his rifle and no live ammo in barracks, anyway) so I wasn't too concerned, but this guy was either sleep-walking in full kit (seen it happen) or was in some kind of real distress.

I started walking toward him, asking again, "Hey, what company are you from? Do you need help or something?"

As I got to within about 10 yards of him, he slowly shook his head twice and backed out of the door, which closed as he stepped through.

Before I could reach it, the door clicked fully shut and I heard the miniature **BEEP** of the alarm re-setting itself. If I opened it now, the whole system would go off as an unauthorized door trigger alert and someone at Battalion CQ would see it and send a runner over to chew my ass up about it. On top of that, the door alarm would set off the PA system in the platoon barracks and wake everybody's ass up. Then I'd be really fucked. 

Nobody wants to be *that* guy, right?

I sat down back at the desk. Logan looked a little concerned. 
I tried to ease his mind, saying, "Don't worry about it, dude. That was probably someone from Echo company who fucked up and didn't give an Officer the greeting of the day or something. I wish I could learn to sleepwalk on patrol like that." 

CQ means you're up 24 hours straight, just watching the barracks, answering the phones, signing in visitors and generally being responsible for the fuckery associated with the Army on a given day. When my shift ended at 0700, I went to do my laundry. It was a Sunday and the NCO's and Officers never really checked in on those days so, naturally, I fell asleep on a pile of towels and sheets in the laundry room. 

I woke up two hours later with SFC Jones standing over me. Nearly made me shit my newly-washed pants.

"Get up, I gotta talk to you."

At approximately 2:30 AM on the night of June 21st, police and EMS had responded to a call of a motorcyclist down in the street just off post near Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. 

James had been riding home on his GSRX from an off-post Bible study group. His bike had been found almost a block away, and an employee from a 24 hour restaurant found him laying in the bushes next to the sidewalk. His left side was crushed and when the restaurant employee tried to take his helmet off, she likely exacerbated a spinal-column injury that sent him into cardiac and respiratory arrest. 

My 19 year old brother, James, an active duty Infantryman stationed with the 82nd Airborne, was DOA at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center. 

The Medical Examiners once again told my Mom that another of her sons likely didn't suffer and never felt a thing after he lost consciousness. 


I don't believe a word of it. 


I felt Rob's fear. The agony in my chest on that night was unlike anything I had experienced, nor have I ever felt that sensation since. Abject terror is an experience one never forgets. I remember telling my best friend that night, "Dude, I feel like I want to die."

And as for James, I can't tell you that I felt his pain while he laid there on the concrete for who knows how long. Nobody heard a crash, a squeal of tires leaving the scene. There were no cries for help. 

But I know it was him in that doorway that night. Everything about that soldier in the dark door shouted "I had my shit together." 
But the sadness, the dejection I felt rolling off him said, "I'm so sorry."
And then the door closed, and I never saw him again.


Now I'm the only one left.

<TITLE> In the Cameras. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I worked at a fairly large arts and crafts retailer for about six months. The work experience there is fairly standard; customer service, employee interaction, store maintenance, etc. 
During my time with the company I moved from the second highest profit generating store in the company to one of the least productive stores in a completely different city. Normally, I worked with at least 10 other employees in the store at a given time but now, at the new location, I was faced with being one of usually four workers in the store and almost always the only male employee on shift. Of course, any kind of heavy lifting, truck unloading, and, especially, store security fell to me to take care of.


About two months ago I'm in the office going through my manager's checklist of tasks for the day when I glance at the security video feed on the television monitor. It's your basic four screen monitor so you can watch four camera feeds simultaneously. I go back to my reading my checklist when I realize that something was off about the video feed. I look back to the screen and there's this guy standing at the end of aisle six (clay, craft glues   adhesives, stencils) just staring up at the camera. The video feed cycles to a different camera somewhere else in the store and I shrug it off thinking that it's probably some kid interested in the big black spheres on the ceiling that house the cameras and sound system speakers. 
The feed cycles back around to the first camera and the kid is gone, probably called back to his mother and walking around the store again. 
But then I look and there he is again, in a completely different part of the store, staring in that same sideways look as before. This time he's over in aisle 30 (yarn, stitchery) and  fairly close to the warehouse/receiving area of the store which is off-limits to customers. 
It's a straight shot from the office back to the receiving area down the side aisle of the store so I walk back to take a look and see if this kid's still over there. He's not. In fact, there's nobody in this corner of the store. 
With better things to do than hunt for some weird kid in a store full of things to be fixed, moved or re-stocked, I go back to work.


Fast-forward a couple days and I'm closing the store on the 4-9:30 PM shift. We generally close on the dot at 9:00 and have the store cleaned, recovered and ready for the next day by 9:30 (everyone works harder at closing time because we're all so ready to go home). Generally, people are out of the store by about 5-10 minutes before we close, but on this particular night I'm back in the office putting away RF guns and radios when I notice the security camera feeds again. 


There's this same kid, now over in the aisle 17 or 18 (art supplies, canvas) pulling his same game again. 
I call on the radio to my coworker, Ashley, who is two aisles away at the framing desk, "Ashley, go look on 17 or 18 and let this guy know that we're closing in five minutes. And let me know if he seems 'off' to you."
About 45 seconds later Ashley calls back, "Nobody over here, I bet he went up to the front to leave or check out."
Not convinced, I look at the video screen again in time to see him standing in front of the sliding entrance door staring at camera #1. The door is motion activated and he's standing close enough that it should either be sliding open or be standing wide open if he'd been standing there long enough. The door is firmly closed. 
I call BJ, the cashier, and ask her to make "the announcement"; this is the call that goes over the Public Address system to let customers know the store is now closed and that they need to exit the store or finish up at the checkout counter. BJ makes the announcement and we do our rounds, checking the store for stray customers or children who may not have heard or paid attention to the PA system. Nobody is left in the store but employees. 


A call comes over the radio. It's the manager and she sounds pissed.
"Someone go back to receiving and get that person out of there. Let them know we. are. closed."
Apparently the manager is seeing someone in the security camera feed from the camera back in receiving.
I'm closest to receiving so I head back to look. 
The first sign that something is wrong is that receiving is dark; the lights are on an automatic timer once the store closes, the receiving area's timer is shorter because generally there's nothing to do back there when shutting down the store. There aren't any windows or ambient light back there so when it's dark, it's dark. All the camera should be seeing is a blacked out void. 
I call the manager on the radio and ask, "Are you sure someone's back there? The lights are off and I don't think the camera can see in the dark."
Annoyed, she radios back, "The camera is showing the lights on and bright and there's someone back there staring up at the camera in the corner. Go ask them to leave."


Just to be clear, I am 6'1" and 180 pounds. I would consider myself to be of medium build, but I'm also in the Army and know how to "throw my weight around", if you will. At this point, I'm thoroughly unnerved by the situation. I therefore make the decision that I'm going to breach this room in the most obvious and forceful way possible so as to make as much noise as I can and sound like more than one person doing it. 

I stack up beside the door, back off a few feet and kick it.
The left side of the double door smashes open and collides with a metal display behind it, making a clattering sound that echoes through the receiving area.
The right side of the door swings outward with a big WHOOSH of air from the pressure differential I've created between the two rooms. 
I shout into the empty receiving area, "I'm sorry but we're closed! It's time to leave, please!" (Because even in the weirdest circumstances, customer service always comes first).
The manager calls me on the radio again, "Hey, quit tearing stuff up back there. And I don't see that person anymore. The lights shut off and the camera's blacked out. Come back to the front and finish up."
It is at this point that the main lights of the store begin to go out. As I walk back up the main aisle running the length of the store, the lights go out as I pass under them. For every four lights that extinguish themselves, one emergency light takes their place, bathing the store in what can best be described as "indoor moonlight".
As the closing crew finishes up, we head back to the office to clock out and turn in our radios. It's company policy for all employees to leave the store together in order to avoid accidents, keep accountability, counter theft, and to ensure that absolutely no one is left in the store. 


We're all in the office when BJ blurts out, "Are you kidding me? Look at the video screen."
There in the monitor, standing in front of the entrance door again, is the person, staring in that sideways manner up at the camera. As we watch, the light goes out at the front, sending the camera into darkness. 
As that camera goes dark, the system cycles to the next nearest working feed. And there he is. 


This time we're fixated, studying this guy. He's average height with dark, curly hair that covers his eyebrows, making it hard to see his eyes. He's wearing brown pants and a hoodie with the hood pulled up. He looks completely normal but for the strange angle of his head and the intensity of his gaze directed at the camera. He's not so much looking at the camera as looking straight at us through the screen. 
Camera after camera cycles across the screen, most are totally dark, but some are still picking up the faint twilight of the emergency lights nearby. And there he is. In every feed. 
It's then that we realize the dark cameras are seeing him too, it's almost as if there's a blacker blackness in their unintelligible images.


There's a clattering from behind the group of us huddled in the office. In her unease Ashley has backed into the file cabinet behind her, knocking an inner shelf loose. It crashes down to the bottom of the cabinet, echoing terribly through the now silent retail store.
He hears it. 
Suddenly every camera feed is blank. He's been looking for us.
Through the plate glass window on the office door our view outside is distorted by the differential of light between the office and the emergency lights in the aisle. It's very hard to tell who or what is out there.
BJ gasps. Even with the glare from the office lights its clear there is someone standing about a quarter of the way down the aisle from the door. Standing. Staring.
The light in the office suddenly clicks out. 
There's another WHOOSH sound followed by what can only be described as a grotesque splattering, sucking and gurgling sound.
Just as suddenly, every light in the store blazes to life. It's blinding fireworks show of burning xenon, neon and fluorescent lighting. 
As our eyes all adjust we're met with a grizzly sight. 


The window on the office door is slick with bright scarlet blood. It sticks to the window in clots and runs down the edges in thin rivulets, wending its way down to the floor where it begins to pool.
As an Army Medic, my 68W training kicks in and I immediately identify this as the kind of blood that spurts, pours and oozes from the most serious and painful injuries; this is the blood of certain death. 

Two weeks later I put in my notice. The man hasn't been seen in the store, nor does he appear in the video recordings from that night.


Upper management doesn't believe a word of it. They've begun making "cutbacks" to our staff and replacing floor managers with promoted employees from other stores. Of the group of us, only the manager has any kind of intention of staying in that store. 


Maybe she's made of tougher stuff.


Maybe she knows the guy.
