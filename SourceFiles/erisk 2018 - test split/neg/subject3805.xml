<TITLE> The Dusk Makes Me Sad </TITLE>

<TEXT> Apparently, its common for people with anxiety and depression. Browse through any number of [subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2rcdn9/anxietydissociation_worse_in_late_afternoondusk/) and [Google searches](http://www.socialanxietysupport.com/forum/f24/sunsets-are-depressing-635977/), and youll find another person who dreads the sun as it dips below the horizon.

I think it has something to do with the passage of time the knowledge that another day has gone by. You are one day older, your family and friends are one day older, and theyre all going to die if you dont find a way to control every single part of life.

For me, it happens almost every Sunday without fail. Im frozen on my couch, watching the sky fade to a muted purple as shadows wash over my apartment. 

Ironically, the only way for me to get out of my funk is to completely immerse myself in it I put on my sneakers and take a run through my neighborhood at dusk.

Something about actually breathing the cool air and watching the sky change makes it a little more bearable. Dusk is a fascinating time to explore suburbia. Mostly everyone is sitting down for dinner, so the streets are quiet and still. I occasionally see a dog-walker or an elderly couple out for a stroll, but besides that, I usually have the orange sky to myself.

My running path is a street dotted with small but beautifully unique houses. I always start my route at a brick house, choked by dark, thick moss, with a door that looks straight out of the Shire. And then its on to a tiny, royal blue cottage. A house with a wrap-around porch and a spire tower. A garden protected by three lazy, old cats that greet me with a sleepy blink whenever I run by.

Theres one house that doesnt fit. I call it the Window House.

Its at least three stories high, dwarfing the other homes on the street. Its effectively a slightly crooked box decorated with dozens of windows. Theres so many of them, they look like theyre choking the house. Theres a stained-glass window butted up against a dirty sheet of plastic, both topped by a half-moon of blue marble glass. A Gothic, arching window taking up two stories. I could go on.

Most of the windows are too dirty to see inside. When I do manage to catch a glimpse, the interior looks empty and worn. Ive never seen anyone go in or out. No cars in the driveway. Weeds choke the lawn, overgrown with tall grass and ivy. Its an ugly, strange house, and I hated it.

I hate it even more after what happened.

About two weeks ago, I felt my anxiety bubbling up before I even saw the sunset but there it was, beautiful and terrible all at the same time. I put on a sweatshirt, laced up my old, beat-up running shoes, and hit the pavement. It was a cool, cloudy night and the neighborhood was already lit with the warm glow of so many full houses at the end of the day.

Except for the Window House.

It was dark and quiet as usual. By the time I reached it, I was losing steam after a hard run and my shoes were, too. My right shoe had a loose sole that I refused to give up on. I didnt have $150 to spare on a new pair.

I stopped to fix my shoes in front of the Window House. The last line of sunlight glinted off the many windows. It was almost pretty.

As I looked up at the house, I noticed something that made my breath catch.

There was a face in one of the windows.

It was on the second story. The wide, plastic window was too dirty to see any features, and I looked away too quickly before I could really study the face but it was there. I snuck a quick look up at the window again. All I could make out was the pale moon of a face and two wide eyes. Unblinking and blank.

I doubled-back home soon after, unnerved by the face in the window. Both times Id looked at it, it was staring right at me. So someone did live there, albeit someone weird.

Another dusk, another run. This time I attempted to maintain a steady jog as I passed the Window House, but, no dice. My shoes were even more busted up after a particularly long run, so I had to stop and adjust. I casually snuck a glance up to one of the windows.

The face was back.

I stopped, all semblance of politeness gone. I stared right back into their eyes.

I say they because I couldnt tell the gender of the person. The glass was still too dirty to see anything more. They rarely blinked. No eyebrows, I noticed, and no hair. Smooth, pale moon face.

About a minute into our staring contest, their mouth started to move. It looked like they were babbling, tripping over their words, rarely taking a breath. The combination of their unblinking eyes and odd mushmouth unnerved me enough to warrant a reaction. I immediately fell back on Pacific Northwest defensive friendliness I gave them a thumbs-up.

Their mouth snapped shut. And then, slowly, a white hand appeared in the window. Its movements looked pained and foreign as the hand contorted into an awkward, alien approximation of a thumbs-up.

I decided to go home.

I skipped my run for the next few evenings and instead spent time chasing the dusk away with bad TV and a few beers. When I finally felt good enough to revisit my route, I had the luck of passing by an old couple I occasionally saw walking. I asked them about the house who lives there?

No one lives there. Its condemned and the city is trying to decide what to do with it.

Well, I saw a face in one of the windows.

You must be seeing things, dear. Its all boarded up. Not even squatters could get in if they wanted to.

I wasnt about to assume there was a ghost or something like that in the house. Besides, people who are desperate for shelter are crafty. It was an odd looking person, but it had to be a person.

Still, I avoided the Window House that evening.

The next night would be the last time I ran that route.

There was a chill in the air that warranted a thick sweatshirt and leggings, but the sunset was beautiful that evening. A deep wash of pink clouds spread across the sky, mixed with the purple tinge of dusk.

Nights like those made me feel like I was running on air, even with my busted shoes. I streaked through the neighborhood, barely registering the Window House and the quiet, insistent noise I heard as I passed it.

*tap tap tap tap*

I slowed, half-tempted to ignore it, before curiosity and societal politeness got the best of me.

Guess who.

It was the face again, this time a crooked finger tapping on the thin glass of the window. I frowned at them. I realized I had never seen them blink.

*tap tap tap tap*

They almost looked like they were pointing downwards. My eyes fell on the busted front steps of the house, paint chipping from the ends of the wood.

There, on the middle step, was a pair of new running shoes. Nike, bright blue, just my size.

I thought of the few times Id stopped in front of the house to adjust my shoes. I didnt know what to do. Were they for me?

I looked up at the face again. It had stopped tapping the window and was staring down at me, as if waiting. The white hand emerged again in an uncomfortable pantomime of a thumbs-up.

The steps were close enough to the sidewalk so that I didnt feel too stupid or unsafe for walking up to the shoes to inspect them. I was a step away from the shoes when I froze. Time seemed to slow. My heart dropped in my chest and my fingers went cold.

Inside the shoes were two human feet, the ankles cut cleanly through the bone. Blood soaked into the fabric of the shoe.

I reeled back, gasping, and my head jerked up to the window. Unblinking, wide eyes. A round, featureless face. From this angle, I realized I couldnt see any kind of neck or shoulders attached to the head.

I ran home, sobbing, and called the police.

They havent matched the severed feet to a body, yet. Police searched the Window House and found no signs of life no discarded tents or food waste left behind by squatters.

The dusk still makes me nervous, so Ive found a new neighborhood to take my evening runs in. Its a wealthy neighborhood where every house is occupied nightly almost every house. 

Theres a hulking McMansion that just went up on the market, huge and lonely and empty. My route takes me past it every evening, and I try not to look at it.

The one time I did, I saw a pale face in one of the second story windows.

It looked sad. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Does anyone know where to buy a Mermaid Frappuccino? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-27 06:33:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Does anyone know where to buy a Mermaid Frappuccino in Baltimore that isnt a lake infested with bloodthirsty dead people? I tried to go buy one after I found an ad for it online, but I ended up having to fucking fight for my life against a bunch of reanimated corpses that bobbed up from the bottom of a lake.

Hey everybody. Its me again. I finally got my shower fixed. Thanks for the lack of good plumber recommendations. Yall suck.

Anywaymy main man Roscoe got out of prison about a week ago. Ever since he got out and got clean, Roscoe has been trying to live life to the fullest and that means doing stuff like yoga, reading and cutting back on crack and heroin. *BORINGGGGG*.

So when Roscoe heard about the Unicorn Frappuccino, he went nuts. I swear to god, hes a little girl in the body of a 300-pound Asian dude with an eye patch.

The problem is, Starbucks stopped selling them on Sunday.

Call me a softy, but it really killed me when I realized Id have to break the news to him. I assumed there must be some other kind of mystical creature overpriced coffee drink out there so one night, after a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 (Blue Raspberry, of course), I dove into the world wide webs.

Thats where I found the website for the Mermaid Frappuccino.

It didnt really *look* like the Starbucks website. It featured this gnarly blue drink topped with puke-green whipped cream. It looked like crystal meth in a cup. Im talking cleaning-solution blue, with big chunks of who-the-hell-knows-what floating in it. I think I saw an eyeball in there, maybe.

Right below it were some words in really small print:

*SINK BELOW*
*PEEL THE FLESH FROM YOUR BONES*
*LET YOUR LUNGS COLLAPSE*
*CONSUMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEE*
*LOCH RAVEN RESERVOIR*
*MIDNIGHT*

I assumed those were trendy hashtags Starbucks was using to promote its brand, but #peelthefreshfromyourbones just wasnt doing it for me. Loch Raven Reservoir was a big-ass lake in Baltimore County, so I thought they were cashing in locally on the caffeinated creature craze.

As for the drink I guess if you turned your head and squinted and were colorblind, it kind of looked good.

Luckily, Roscoe *is* colorblind, farsighted and a little cockeyed, so when I showed him the drink, he was PUMPED. I thought it looked sketchy as hell, but when Roscoe gave me those bloodshot, twitchy puppy eyes, I just couldnt resist.

Anyway, Roscoe couldnt drive because right before he went to prison he gunned his car into a 7/11 because he was coked up and wanted a Hot Pocket, so I had to take the wheel.

We jumped into Lupe Fiasco, my Ford Pinto, and were off. I wanted to get there on time for Roscoe.

I was pretty sure they didnt sell Frappuccinos at Loch Raven Reservoir, but Roscoe said his prison therapist always told him to expect the unexpected. I think he was referring to prison murder attempts, but I appreciated the sentiment anyway.

We rolled into the reservoir parking lot a few minutes after midnight. The place was dead silent and dead empty.

Roscoe jumped out of the car, running up to the edge of the water. It was pitch black on the beach and the water was still as glass. I looked around. No Starbucks in sight. Roscoes face fell. It hurt my heart to see him so disappointed.

Suddenly, a high-pitched screech ripped the air like a loud fart.

Roscoe and I both shrieked. The air was filled with a hellish mix of our screams. All of the noise really aggravated my chronic tinnitus, which I developed after DJing at Baltimores premiere strip club, *Bitches R Us*.

I slammed my hands over my ears. The lake started to violently bubble and churn, frothing white. A stench like the worst fart youve ever smelled filled the air. Im sorry I keep using these fart metaphors, but Im just trying to set the scene in a realistic way.

I realized maybe it wasnt the best idea to visit a lake at midnight because something on the Internet said theyd be a Frappuccino there.

The screaming suddenly stopped. The water stopped churning, the smell disappeared. Everything went quiet.

Something bobbed up a few feet away from the shore. Roscoe and I exchanged looks and then inched towards the edge of the water.

It was a bloated, nasty-ass looking corpse. Its tongue poked from its mouth and one of its eyes was hanging loose.

Baltimore County had really gone to the fucking dogs. I was not completely shocked that there was a corpse in the source of our drinking water.

I was hoping this was all a really imaginative marketing ploy, and the corpse would have the Frappuccino in its hand.

Instead, it slowly turned its head towards us with a series of sharp cracks. I heard Roscoe whimper.

*Saaaacccrrriiifffiiicccceeeee*, it hissed.

More corpses bobbed to the surface of the lake, all of their heads splintering around to stare at us.

And then they started flailing towards shore.

Roscoe and I finally realized there was no Mermaid Frappuccino here.

We bolted towards the lights of the parking lot. I made the mistake of looking behind my shoulder to see the corpses *sprinting* at us, going full on Usain Bolt.

I turned back around and suddenly realized Roscoe was gone. It was pitch black and hard to see anything, but I couldnt even hear his chains rattling as he ran. My heart slammed against my chest. I was terrified, zombies were chasing me, I didnt know where my best friend was, and I was totally out of shape.

My foot snagged on a branch and I sprawled over, getting a face full of sand. The fall ripped a sob out of me as I crawled behind a big rock, trying to hide from the zombies.

At that point, covered in snot and sand and about to be killed by zombies, I considered my life.

I thought I had it all figured out I laid off the Patron, quit Tinder and had my best friend back in my life. Didnt matter. I was still sitting behind a rock, crying like a baby. I didnt know what else I could do, but it still felt like there was this hole in my heart that I couldnt drown with MadDog 20/20 or plug up with McGangbangs, a delicious McDonalds secret menu item that involves a McChicken stuffed between a Double Cheeseburger.

What the hell was wrong with me, besides my alcohol dependency, lack of proper diet and exercise, and occasional hard drug habit? Why was I even in this crazy situation, just for one goddamn Frappucino?

Roscoe flashed through my mind again. I hoped he was okay. Suddenly, I realized I didnt care if I got out of this alive but I sure as hell cared if Roscoe did.

A very confusing light bulb went off in my head.

And then a shrieking corpse lunged at me.

I screamed. Another flash of movement behind the corpse. A sudden crunch as a prison shank went directly through the back of the zombies head.

Roscoe tossed the corpse aside and grabbed my hand to pull me up. I was suddenly overcome with emotion. I realized what meant the most to me in life.

The answer was standing right in front of me 67, eye patch, twitchy.

Roscoe.

In the heat of passion I latched onto Roscoes face with my mouth. I kiss like a lamprey. He looked surprised for a hot minute before he pried me off of him and then turned around to face the twenty other corpses running at us.

I picked up a rock. Roscoe wiped off his prison shank on his cargo shorts. We gave each other a knowing look. 

It was time to say fuck this and get out of there.

We sprinted back to the parking lot and peeled out. Lupe went 0 to 60 in 45.8.

The car ride back was quiet, and not just because we were both mentally scarred by what had happened and would probably need years of therapy to cope with it.

I was a little scared that Roscoe didnt return my feelings, but halfway through the drive he grabbed my hand and grinned at me.

I grinned back.

Ever since then, life has been good except for one thing. Roscoe is still fixed on that goddamn mermaid diabetes drink.

So if anyone knows where to get a Mermaid Frappuccino thats not an infested reservoir filled with dead people, Id really appreciate it. Also dont suggest me DIY shit because Im terrible at it.

Thanks. </TEXT>

Do you know how many of these messages we get a month? At least two. And they are just as arrogant. You could be ALooc or Bloodworth and I would still disagree with you. Nosleep is growing, and more people means more varied content. In fact, I've seen some spectacularly creative stories. Some stories will be bad, but who are you to be the ultimate judge?


Every time I see a "bad" nosleep story, I'm going to upvote it and comment, in the hopes that it will be you.

<TEXT> Hey y'all!

I find that the Sims 3 is a little too easy sometimes. I'm looking for mods that will put more unpredictability into the game, whether that be through dangerous situations or just strange occurrences.

I have Supernatural, Pets, and Ambitions.

Any suggestions? Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey y'all!

I'm planning to create a free ebook of my work. This will include stories from nosleep as well as some unpublished ones that didn't really fit within nosleep.

That being said, I want my writing to be as polished as possible, but it's a little tough editing on my own. I asked some of my friends to help, but most of them aren't writers.

Would any of y'all like to/be willing to read over some of my work? For example, I'm including Does Anyone Know a Good Plumber and Yo, Dude, Do You Own a Dog?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I absolutely love mystery and thrillers, but I often find that they rely too much on "grizzled male detective with problems gets women and solve crime"

That's fine, but I want actual pathos to my characters. Some of my favorite media includes Silence of the Lambs, anything by Gillian Flynn, True Detective (the above statement done right), and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.

<TITLE> Guys here's what happens on May 20th- too scary for /r/nosleep itself, so I had to post it here! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-20 16:27:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Help me. Please, God, help me.

Its here.

The day is here.

I dont have much time, but let me explain.

I woke up this morning and although the day seemed normal, I emerged from my bedroom with a sense of foreboding a je ne sais quoi, as the French say. Do you ever wake with a small sense of hopelessness? As if your body is merely a shell for your own personal anxieties? Im sure you have, but today, I felt that sevenfold.

I felt a deep dread as I puttered about my apartment, going through the daily motions without much feeling shuffling to my kitchen; frying an egg; browsing r/TheRedPill. However, my feelings soon came to a crescendo when I looked at the clock

10:00 AM.

Suddenly, I knew. The reckoning of May 20th would begin at 10:30. I pushed up from the table, suddenly pouring with sweat. As if in a trance, I went to take my keys from the kitchen counter and exit my house. I had to get to my car.

As I approached my car, my physical symptoms became worse. My eyes bulged; my body felt like it was electric, nerves pulsing with a wicked form of energy. I stumbled to my car, dropping the keys countless times, fingers scrabbling on the ground to find the lost object. My world was inside out and the anxiety was like cocaine to my system.

I finally managed to start my car and begin towards my inevitable destination. I didnt want to begin that journey, but I had to. My mind was telling me no, but my obligation to a medical appointment was telling me yes.

You too will experience this one day. You will experience the fear, the disgust, the soulless humanity of my own personal May 20th.

The day of my annual colonoscopy. </TEXT>

<TITLE> CAPTCHA told me to kill my roommate when I tried to watch Twilight. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-18 02:22:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I might be a big, fat idiot, but I didnt think anything was wrong when the CAPTCHA Are you Human? screen told me to kill one of my roommates.


I was trying to stream *Twilight* online, but I want you to know right now that it's not because I actually like the movie. I was drunk and needed something to laugh at, okay?

Anyway, I was past three shots of rum when the CAPTCHA screen appeared:


KILL ROOMMATE


I showed it to one of my roommates, Rachel, who almost pooped herself laughing. It wasnt actually that funny, but drunk people think dirt is hilarious. Rachel and I watched the movie, while our other roommate, Ava, did homework in her room.


I was hungover in the morning, so I stayed in bed and streamed more movies. It was time for *Breaking Dawn*, except this time I was actually interested in Bella and Edwards relationship. Dont judge. I was sprawled in my bed, weakly navigating to the stream page, when another CAPTCHA appeared:


KILL AVA


I narrowed my eyes. What the fuck? I forgot about Breaking Dawn and sat up, rubbing at my eyes. At this point it wasnt funny anymore, it was just weird. Ava isnt a very common name, and what kind of sick CAPTCHA algorithm would generate stuff like that? I mean, Im majoring in Tourism Management, but I sure as hell know that companies block out phrases like that.


Someone had to see this, no matter how bizarre it was. It was Sunday afternoon. Rachel was gone, and Ava was usually at the Souths most annoying megachurch, NewStart!!. Yes, the churchs name has two exclamation points in it. I heard some rustling on the other side of the apartment Ava mustve skipped.


Yo, Ava! I yelled. Maybe CAPTCHA went all NSA on me. Come on, I want to show you something!


Yeah? She rounded the corner into my room, wearing her usual placated smile.


I spun around the laptop on my lap to face her. I tilted the screen so she could read, and as I did her expression dropped from a smile to neutral as stone.


I watched her expression with one of those eager dog faces after you show someone something funny.


She punched me in the mouth.


I whipped over the side of the bed and smacked on the floor, eyes rolling to Ava for a split second before she kicked me hard in the stomach.


I retched and rolled over, scrabbling to get up, hair in my eyes and my heart thumping. She was screaming the entire time, this shrill, one-note screech, kicking me over and over again. As she rolled back for another kick my mind suddenly snapped into action. I threw myself to my desk and she threw herself at me, screaming and scratching at my eyes. I grabbed the knife in my desk and jammed it in her shoulder. She screamed, dislodging herself before running out of my room.


I stood, shaking, before lunging at my door to lock it. I drew back and caught my face in my mirror my mouth was dribbling blood and I was missing a front tooth. I looked like a hillbilly. Whatever. I already go to college in South Carolina. Deal with that later.


Nothing that happened in the past five minutes made any sense, but I knew that I had to get out of the house. I couldnt stay locked up in the apartment with her.


I grabbed my tote bag and pocketknife before waiting at my door for a minute, listening.


Nothing.


Knife in hand, I cracked my door open and looked around the crack. The living room was empty. I inched out of my room when I heard a whisper. It was coming from Avas room; quick and frantic whispers.


*FIRSTANDLASTfirstandlastfirstandlastnononononononononononono*


First and last? Uh, no thank you.


I rushed past her door and out the front door to the apartment complex. I decided to go to my friend Sams apartment. I thought that once I got to his apartment, I could explain things and call the police. Sam gets drunk a lot and wears fedoras ironically, but hes still a pretty normal person.


He answered the door on the first knock, giving my hillybilly mouth the stink-eye. Kierra, what the hell happened to your face?


Ava beat me up.


*What*?


I pushed past him and dumped my stuff on his couch before grabbing paper towels from the kitchen. He plopped his generous frame on his couch and I explained my story in detail, pausing once in a while to blot my bloodied mouth. I split my lip on my tooth and it hurt like a mofo.


Was she drunk? he asked.


No. You know she doesnt get drunk. I was getting antsy. I tossed the paper towel in the trashcan once the bleeding steamed. The whole thing seemed completely batshit. Ava was tough, but she wasnt unstable.


I finally looked up at Sam. Any ideas?


Call the cops?


Well, no shit, I couldve just sat on my ass in my locked room and done that 30 minutes ago. I picked up my phone to call the cops when my phone buzzed. A text from a blocked number:


CAPTCHA
NEWSTART!!
GO NOW


That damn church Ava always went to. Great. This was the last thing I wanted to do hungover. Sam looked over my shoulder and we both frowned. 


Who the hell texted you?


I dont know. But I think we need to go to Newstart!!.


No way.


The last time I didnt do something internet communication told me to do, I got the shit beaten out of me.


Thats a stupid reason to follow some random text!


There was a knock on the door.


I flinched, but Sam brushed me off. "It's just Trey back from church."


He waddled to the door and Trey stepped into the apartment, smiling, before his eyes locked on me. His expression slacked.


"THE FIRST AND LAST," he screamed.


Oh, shit.

<TEXT> Many, many people say that too much cursing in a story is inappropriate. I politely disagree with them.

It really depends on what kind of story you're writing, and who your narrative voice is. You might have a nun who never utters more than a "holy moley", or you could have a character who truly does curse every sentence.

When you develop your character, you choose a writing style for them. Tons of people curse, and curse often. Why can't that translate into writing? Go for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just YOLO it!

The definition of this phrase that I literally just made up means: "Just go for it". I could've said "just go for it", but I was feeling up to using the word YOLO.

But seriously, I would say just go for it. If you feel really nervous, you can post on a throwaway account. Or, have a trusted someone read before you submit.

A story based off of mental illness is very plausible. Just make sure you've researched. Good luck! </TEXT>

I'm planning to expand my social media ventures to Facebook, a Weebly site, etc...and I need to figure out a name to use.

I'm conflicted, though, as to whether I should use my username, or an associated pen-name, Frederick Ellison. Everyone knows me by my username, but maybe I could integrate my pen-name into social media. I don't want to risk confusion, though...

Thoughts? Thanks so much! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Does anyone know a good plumber? I did one of those stupid rituals and now my shower is leaking. And theres a faceless guy in my kitchen. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-29 20:17:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Does anyone know a good plumber? I fucked up one of those stupid ritual things that everyone is doing and now my shower is leaking and also theres some faceless guy in my kitchen. My landlord comes tomorrow and hes going to kill me, especially because I also have a cat and Im not even supposed to have pets.


It all started when I was drunk messaging a girl on Tinder and she said that the only way we would meet up was if I did this weird ritual thing where I summon a ghost or some shit. I think she called it Mea Culpa or something.


Actually, her exact message was,


*the decaying flesh will not rest i am the alpha and omega i have seen the burning cities consume the earth hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh [LINK TO RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS] our souls meet when darkness spills mea culpa mea culpa mea culpa kkkkkkkkkkkkkkggggggg*


She was a weird chick.


At least, I think she was a girl. I couldnt really see her face. Her picture was just a black background with two shiny dots that kind of looked like eyeballs. You could sort of see some features, but it looked like her face was gray and I couldnt really see her mouth. But she had really good skin. I wasnt about to rally for a pizza face.


So, anyway, I weighed the pros and cons of spooky rituals *vs* trampoline booty as best I could on five shots of Patron.


It was totally worth it.


I set my cell phone to 3:26 am, but since my phone is a 2005 Motorola Razor that was dropped in the toilet several times, it went off at 4:00am. FUCK.


I decided to go through with the ritual anyway. I was also supposed to have a friend during this thing, but my bestie recently got incarcerated for selling heroin on the corner of Patterson Park and Eastern Avenue. Shout out to my main man, Roscoe. 


Anyway, I sat up and turned off my alarm, but the moment I turned it off I drunkenly passed out again. I woke up 20 minutes later and actually got out of bed this time, stumbling around the room in the dark because apparently youre not supposed to turn on the lights, because if you do a GHOST WILL POP OUT OOOH.


I was supposed to find a candle and light it, but my hangover just made me trip over one of the several candles I placed on my floor. Eventually I gave up and flipped the lights on, grabbing a candle from my desk.


I squinted out my window to see what my ghetto Baltimore neighborhood looked like at 4:20am. The street was empty except for some rando wearing a black robe and a giant pointy black hat. He was staring up at me through the window. I couldnt really see his face. You know, Baltimore has gone to the fucking dogs. First gang wars, now an updated KKK. For Gods sake.


I lit the candle and looked at my phone. I was supposed to knock on my bedroom door 66 times, the 66th knock timed on the 4:06, but since I had fucked everything else up I just did a Shave and a Haircut knock and then walked into my hallway. My bedroom door is opposite the stairs, and looking down that dark stairwell was pretty spooky. I thought I saw something move on one of the lower steps.


For the next step, I was supposed to close my eyes and walk forward while chanting, *mea culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa*, which is Italian for my Culpa, which is probably some kind of shitty Italian car. I tried to close my eyes and walk forward while talking about Italian cars, but my cat, Fish Sticks, ran under my feet and I ended up tripping over him and falling down the flight of stairs.


At some point the stupid candle went out as I flailed down the stairs, but I was too concussed to care. I rolled up from the ground, groaning, and decided that I would just continue to go through the motions, which meant hiding in a closet and waiting for the ghost to play hide and seek with me. I chose the kitchen pantry because I had some opened potato chips in there, so I made my way back.


As I stumbled, I heard several soft whispers behind me. I spun around, hoping that I was right about Fish Sticks knowing how to talk, but there was no one there.


Except for the figure standing in the corner.


I stopped, blinked, and it was gone. I really needed to lay off the Patron.


As I honed in on the closet, the alcohol and concussion finally caught up with me and I stumbled to a stop, doubling over and vomiting watery Patron all over my kitchen floor. FUCK. My ass was landlord grass. The hellish combination of alcohol, concussion, post-vomit and a looming eviction notice caused my emotions to go haywire and I unleashed a violent sob, mucus and tears rivering down my face.


I heard a noise outside the kitchen.


My eyes fell on the kitchen window and I spied that stupid gang member/KKK dude in my backyard, still staring at me. I mustve looked like an idiot, weeping in front of my kitchen pantry. Too ashamed to confront him, I just crawled into the pantry and shut the door. It was so cold in there it damn froze my man-titties off. My air conditioner was probably broken. I definitely needed to call the landlord, but that would mean sedating Fish Sticks and stuffing him in a suitcase under my bed.


At this point, I realized that I needed to reevaluate my life. Maybe I shouldnt drink as much. Maybe I should give Fish Sticks to a good home. Maybe I should find women with intellect and poise. Maybe I should move out of my shit neighborhood where KKK people roam around at 4am.


After going through an entire existential crisis in my pantry, I decided to say fuck it and end the stupid ritual. That Tinder girl wasnt even that hot, anyway. And besides, I still had like seventy more ritual things to complete, which included lighting eight more candles, stabbing a Japanese doll, and spinning around in a circle while screaming, YOURE IT, YOURE IT!


This was all supposed to culminate in me going to my basement, sitting in front of a mirror, and looking into the mirror *but not actually looking into it*, which made absolutely no fucking sense.


As I got up to open the pantry door, I heard a low moan coming from behind the door. I froze. I prayed to God it wasnt my landlord.


I cracked open the door to see the gang member/KKK guy standing in the kitchen, staring at me. I finally got a good look at him. He definitely didnt have a face. I guess getting your face taken away is part of a gang ritual now.


He didnt react to my presence he just stared. I didnt know how the hell to deal with gang members or faceless KKK members, so I just stared back. We did this for about five minutes before I slowly inched out of the kitchen and back upstairs. He turned to watch me as I went, but didnt move.


So after that I went up to my bathroom to take a shower and now my shower-head is leaking, which I blame on the stupid ritual. So if you guys know any good plumbers in the Baltimore area, I would really appreciate it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really like /r/nosleep, but it's no place for my writing. My works are mainly horror/humor, and that's not nosleep's cup of tea. I realized that it ain't the best situation!

Anyway- does anyone know of any other places to showcase my writing? Would Library of Shadows work? Or not even on reddit- I'm looking for anywhere, besides my [Tumblr](http://ellenmeny.tumblr.com/). Thanks! </TEXT>

That's a helluva load of words in one sentence. Try to break it up and move it around a little:

I've decided to write an original story with some familiar themes. I thought about it and realized that my idea was just a springboard for an entirely new story- while the story will take cues from some of my muses, it will be a stand-alone.

<TEXT> My all time favorite is FireRed/LeafGreen. It has all of the nostalgia of the original games, but with better mechanics and more Pokemon.

It terms of newer games, Black/White is a step up from the others because it succeeds where Diamond/Pearl/Platinum failed. Interesting graphics, a more compelling story, and new Pokemon.

EDIT: HG/SS also rocks my socks. </TEXT>

*GO RAVENS*!
________


Dawn.


The sun peeked through the windows as I stood at the altar of the church, smoking a cigarette. The cigarette tasted disgusting, but I looked like an absolute badass so I was struggling through it.


The monster was due to appear any minute now, and I had my shotgun at the ready. If my plan worked, it would be the most epic day of my life. I could write all of my college essays about it. The birth of my first-born child would be welcomed with an apathetic nod, because nothing would be as beautiful as this moment. If my plan didnt work, Brewster and I would both be dead. You win some, you lose some.


There was the loud bang of a slammed door somewhere from within the church, and I whipped around to see Garden Tool slinking from the front of the church, black eyes shining. He wore a massive grin of needles. That hunched, gray form was nothing human or animal and he dragged something along behind him in one of his claws.


He was dragging an unconscious Brewster behind him, my best friend completely out but otherwise unharmed. For a minute I thought he was dead, but then I saw the copious amounts of drool dribbling from his mouth. Typical Brewster sleep behavior.


As Garden Tool neared me, his eyes flickered and he noticed the shotgun in my hand. He hesitated for a moment before leaving Brewster behind on the floor and slinking closer.


You never said no weapons, I said nervously, as if using logic would appeal to a gray dog-human monster.


He hissed a laugh. *I fear no weaponnn. Prepare for deathhh*.


Garden Tool tensed, looking ready to pounce, and I released an incredibly pathetic whimper of fear. I caught myself, attempting to remain stoic.


This isnt a regular gun, I managed, relatively close to peeing myself in fear. Garden Tool suddenly seemed to notice that I had modified my gun with something. Dont ask, Im in AP Engineering. I call this baby the Baptizer 2000. Not only does it shoot bullets, but holy water too.


*Your pathetic religion wont kill meee* Garden Tool hissed with laughter once more, squinting in delight. He moved from his crouched position, and my fear dampened. He was amused. *God is dead*.


Dont worry, Im an Atheist.


*Everything after death is nothinggg. Darknessss. Life is meaningless*.


You know, Ive been doing a lot of thinking. I paused to exhale smoke from the cigarette, attempting not to choke and start tearing up. Ive been contemplating life.


*Sucideee*? he asked, hopefully.


No. Ive been thinking about all of the joys of life, and what makes all of our struggles meaningful. You couldve heard a pin drop; Garden Tools expression became slightly confused. I know that religion might not hurt youbut you know what will? I paused, letting it soak in.


Love. Love will kill you.


Although he tried to hide it, I saw his expression flicker into one of absolute fear, and then switch immediately back to an expression of amusement. *Love? Love? Emotion is nothingggg*.


You keep on saying that things are nothing. Youre wrong. Love is everything. Back in my house? The shotgun and armchair hurt you because Brewster and I were protecting one another. Mildreds rosary worked because her grandfather gave it to her. A lot religious items work because people feel a sense of love within religion.


As I ended my speech, Garden Tools eyes widened. Damn, I shouldve written my thesis paper on that shit. It was pure gold. Looking forward, this speech weighed more importance than whatever theses I was planning to write in the future.


Garden Tool, youre right. Religion wont hurt you. But you know what will? I cocked the gun. This, and 100 pounds of explosives. Filled with love. Platonic love. Bro love.


Garden Tool didnt react; I knew that he didnt want me to see his confusion. I cocked my head at the Jesus statue behind me. He glanced at the statue, its arms held out in a welcoming gesture arms now full of dynamite, dynamite that I bought using my mothers credit card at a shady downtown Baltimore weapons shop that Ray Lewis probably frequented. The dynamite gathered in a string that lead down to directly in front of me. Garden Tool couldnt contain his shock; he whipped his head at me with an expression of pure fury. His nostrils flared.


He lunged at me, claws out and jaws agape, and I shot him square in the mouth with a combination of holy water and bullets. Garden Tool seemed to freeze and drop in mid-air like lead; crumpling on the ground and frothing from the mouth. An inhuman gargle ran from his jaws. He attempted to rise; I shot his back and he crumpled up, howling.


I stepped up to him, tossing my gun aside. I daintily held my cigarette in my fingertips. I was glad to stop smoking it; smoking tasted like shit.


Youre reign of terror is over, Garden Tool, I said. Never again will you prey on people who steal Pokmon games from other people.


Through his gurgling and writhing, I saw something slip from one of his eyes, as clear as day. A tear.


My heart fell. I wasnt as badass as I wouldve liked to think I was, despite the despicable nature of the creature. I blotted out the cigarette out on one of the chairs and aimed the gun at Garden Tools head.


*Au revoir*, asshole, I said. It was the best I could do.


After the deed was done, I set about removing Brewster from the church. I was planning on triumphantly carrying him from the church, the building blowing up behind me, but after my change of heart on blowing up a church and my little to none arm strength, I ended up pulling his dead weight by his foot. I had to bump the door open with my back and drag him through, but as I was doing so the door accidentally closed on his head and he woke his a start.


He held the door open, sitting up and blinking groggily at me. Dude? He suddenly snapped back into consciousness and jumped up, crushing me in a massive hug. BRO! YOURE ALIVE!


We pulled back. Ive never been more alive!


Tears sprung up in his eyes. And you saved me, bro.


We fist bumped. Hey, Brewster. Thats what I do best.


We walked out from the church and to where Mildred was waiting outside, leaning against Brewsters car. After taking a tour through more of the unsavory parts of Baltimore, trolling for explosives, she wasnt exactly happy with me. She studied us.
All of those Reddit weirdos want you two to become a couple.


Excuse me? I asked. Were just brothers from another mother.


She sighed and cocked an eyebrow. So, did you kill him? I thought there was supposed to be an explosion and you walk out of the church triumphantly.


Hes dead, but no explosion. I paused, shrugging. I really didnt want to blow up a church. Also, I guess Im not one for theatrics and death in the same situation.


She frowned. Tell that to those weird nosleep people.


Suddenly, the church exploded behind me, filling the air with a massive boom and an upward rush of smoke and fire. The three of us jumped behind the car, watching the churchs frame burn and crackle.


My eyes widened. That wasnt supposed to happen!


Brewster patted me on the back. Yo, dude, dont worry about it. The Korean people can fix it. Mildred glared at him.


We sat back against the car and all took deep breaths. I nodded at Brewster. Well, buddy, everything turned out okay.


He nodded in return. It totally did. Want to go back to your house and play some more Pokmon?


Most definitely, brother.


I want my game back after youre done, Mildred snapped. And I want another pineapple.


So the three of us drove Brewsters completely destroyed car back to my house, stepped through the busted-in front door, and sat down to play Pokmon. Even though our adventure amounted to several million dollars in damage and probably months of therapy for Brewster and I both, I had my friend by my side. And Mildred, I guess. And when it comes right down to it, religion or no religion, afterlife or no afterlife, good life or bad life, the people you love are all that matter.


At that moment, life was good.


I looked up from the Pokmon game for a moment to see Brewster on the other side of the room and looking out my busted up front door.


Yo, dude, he said, scratching his head. Why is your neighbor wearing a suit?


THE END


______
*Well, thats a wrap! Thank you, thank you, thank you for staying with me through my crazy adventure and supporting my friends and I. Like any good tale of life, my story must end with this. Although Ive been on more adventures, I relinquish a quote to you you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Im not Batman or anything, but you catch my drift.*


*I have a couple of friends who might need a throwaway Reddit account for their life experiences, so I may hand this account over to them, but well see. Regardlessthank you! Brewster and I will be inviting you to our weddingPSYCH! Ha. You wish we were more than bros.*


Thats all, folks,

*Let's just get this party started. No music because silence is just so atmospheric. Just kidding.*
_____


Brewsters car rolled up to a darkened church on one of Baltimore Countys smaller streets. A sign with Korean lettering stood in front of the church. The road was deserted.


My grandpas church, Mildred muttered. I forgot how deserted it was.


Well, lets get inside before that thing hunts us down I got out and slammed the car door behind me, tossing the keys to Brewster. I pulled on the churchs front door, armed with my shotgun. Locked, obviously. I had no clue how to pick a lock, let alone bust a door down, but I wasnt going to look like an idiot in front of Mildred and Brewster. I had already shot a monster in the face; might as well continue my descent into badassery.


Brewster stood next to me at the door, frowning. I dont like this, bro


I know, dude. But this is all we can do right now.


He paused, eyes downcast. This is all my fault. Im sorry, Fred. Im the worst bro ever.


I punched his shoulder. Hey, dont be like that. Youre the best bro ever.


But you still condemned your friend to death, Mildred chimed in, worming her way into the conversation. Brewster went back to looking depressed.


I turned back to the locked door and began using the shotgun as a kind of battering ram before Mildred shoved me aside. Idiot. Let me do it. Youre not fooling anyone.


I quailed away as she got busy picking the lock, finishing with a smug smirk and the click of an unlocked door. She cracked open the door, smile turning into a frown. Jesus. I forgot what a dump this place was.


The three of us piled into the church, locking the door behind us. Mildred flipped on some lights and the space illuminated in a disappointing array of empty chairs and a fake wooden podium. It looked nothing like the predominantly white-Catholic churches of Baltimore; it might have well been a multipurpose room. Bowls of what I assumed were holy water stood at random places in the church. A massive Jesus crucifix was poised behind the altar, weeping blood tears.


Mildred flopped down in a seat. Well, here we are. Feel free to start praying. I dont know.


I paced the back of the church. Okay, so, I propose that we create a gun filled with holy water and wine, call it the Baptizer 2000, and then


*Uhhh*, Mildred said.


I turned to her. Uh, what?


She paused before muttering, I kind of lied about the power of Jesus thing.


I frowned at her. Excuse me?


The religion thing? She avoided eye contact. Actually, that was just a guess.


*WHAT*, I screamed.


She thrust up the rosary she had used to choke Garden Tool. My grandpa gave me this from this church, and that seemed to work. I threw a dollar-store crucifix at Garden Tool once and he laughed. I dont know, okay?


Brewster finally seemed to comprehend what was going on. Soyou drove us out here for nothing?


No! I know theres something about this place that must work, its just she gave a little shrug. I saw her face sadden. I was actually hoping you two could help me. You didnt think I broke into your house just because I wanted to help you out, did you?


You dont seem like the most charitable person. I glared at her.


She matched my glare. Ill have you know, I donate


She silenced at a far off noise the sharp, muffled ring of a telephone.
I scanned the room and saw the telephone perched on the far side of the room. I checked my watch. Who calls a church at 4AM?


No one normal.


I started towards the phone as Brewster yelped, Wait, bro!, but I caught the call on the last ring, answering with a hard, hello. I was getting tired of these games.


Static on the other end.


This isnt scary, I said. I live in Baltimore city, for God sake!


There was a pop of sound, before:


*Where are you going*?


NOWHERE, I screamed, that female monotone ringing in my ear. I AM GOING ABSOLUTELY NOHERE. I AM CURRENTLY STATIONARY.


Stay with me.


I understand literally nothing of what youre saying.


*I am alpha and omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord*.


I shrieked like a small child and hung up the phone. Suddenly, there was a bang and the church lights cut to black. I froze, my voice taken away.


Fred, bro? Brewsters far away voice called.


What the FUCK, I responded.


Something slammed into my temple and white-hot pain split through my head. I fell back, my mind going dizzy for a minute, the darkness and sudden sounds of shouting mixing together in my head. I figured that this was what a hangover felt like. I tried to get up but I struggled; after a minute I managed to stumble to my feet again. Something was strange.


The church was completely silent.


I steadied myself on the wall, pinching the bridge of my nose. My head pounded.


*Brewster*? I called. *Mildred*?


Silence; the pain in my head made it hard to think straight and I ended up stumbling backwards. I thought I was going to hit the wall but instead I fell back into a seat behind a heavy curtain. I panicking for a moment, feeling walls around me, but then I thought back to my church days a confession box.


I rested my head in my hands, rubbing my head. Jesus Christ


*Yesss*?


I looked up, eyes wide. That was definitely not the voice of Jesus.


That was the voice of Garden Tool. 


You are *not* Jesus! I yelled in a random direction, blind in the darkness.


Garden Tool rasped a laugh; I realized he was on the other side of the confession box. The stench of rotting meat filled the air.


*You are not religioussss, are you*?


I happen to abstain from it.


*Then you know God will not save youuu*.


My voice hardened. Turn the lights back on. Where are my friends?


*Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more. But just a pound of fleshhh*.


That cryptic bullshit is nothing to me. First the phone call, then you. I dont care.


*But I have something that is everything to youuu*


What, the Pokmon game? I dont care what you steal from me!


*Return to this church at dawn and I will let him go*.


My heart dropped. What?


The lights suddenly flashed back on. I hissed and squinted before stumbling out of the confession box and throwing the curtain aside.


Garden Tool was gone.


I cursed and suddenly remembered Brewster and Mildred before running to the front of the church. Mildred was just raising herself up off the ground, a hand at her bloodied head.


Brewster was gone.


I feel like I just got hit by a truck Mildred mumbled, still groggy. 


*BREWSTER*! I rushed past her, screaming Brewsters name. At some point I tripped on a chair and tumbled onto the floor, but instead of getting up I just stayed there for a while. I knew my search was fruitless Brewster was gone.


*Return to this church at dawn and I will let him go*.


I eventually got up, Mildred standing over me. What the hell just happened?


I swallowed. Garden Tool took Brewster.


Her eyes widened. What?


I whipped around to her. *The religion shit didnt work, Mildred*! I yelled, kicking a chair. All of this is *bullshit*! He took Brewster! You took us here for nothing! *NOTHING*!


I didnt promise anything. Her voice was hard. I couldve just left you two to die. Instead, I try to help. You should be thanking me for even *trying*.


She threw her arms up in huge movements to show all that she did for us, which added up to breaking into my house, forcing Brewster to cut up a pineapple, asking to go to McDonalds when we were being hunted down, and then taking us to a random Korean church.


I stormed away from her, and, having nowhere else to go, walked up to the altar. I sat down at the front of it and attempted to pray, but no matter how desperate I was, I was still an Atheist. I attempted to be proud of my mental fortitude.


I put my head in my hands and struggled to be calm. All I had to do was face Garden Tool at dawn and Brewster would be fine. Brewster would be fine. Brewster would be fine.


There was still a massive hole in my heart as I attempted to comprehend my own death at the claws of a monster. The fear was there, but no hesitation Brewster was my main bro, my heterosexual life partner. I would take a bullet for him, let alone sacrifice myself to a monster. He would do the same. I looked up at Jesus hanging over the altar. I supposed thats why people coveted religion so much the feeling that someone had your back, no matter what.


A thought suddenly shot through my mind.


My eyes widened and I got up from my seat, effectively standing in awe of my own brilliant idea.


I knew exactly what to do.


Mildred puttered up behind me, giving me a skeptical look. Areare you okay?


Im fine. Im perfectly fine. I turned to look back at her. Hey, Mildred?


What?


...Wheres the closest place we can buy dynamite?

[Part 3](http://redd.it/16uaoe)


*Frederick here again. Almost to the time when I started posting on Reddit! Time flies, doesnt it?*


*[Open this background tab](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFUjwj_RB5o), and Ill continue my story. Sometimes I feel like Im writing a fanfiction of my life for you people*
 
 ____________
*Death has arriveeed*.


When youre about to die, you notice the little things in life. Like the fact that the kitchen faucet was dripping, carelessly left on by Brewster, or the sudden knowledge that you forgot to pick up beef jerky from the store. The little things.


I truly thought that I was going to die. That thing, Garden Tool, stalked into the room with ragged breathing, claws scratching against floorboards. Death was approaching, and I knew that in that moment, we werent infinite.


We were fucked.


I eyed Mildred, muttering to her. Are you absolutely positive a gun wont work against it?


Well, it wont kill it.


Stun?


I guess...


*Commeee out, meattt*


I shot up from behind the armchair and pumped lead into the monster, tumbling back from the shotguns recoil. I attempted to say something suave, like This time, its personal, but all I said was, URFFF.


As I fell back, Garden Tool did too, lurching back with the shots and splattering the room with black blood but just as he rolled on he floor he rose again, bullet wounds filling up with flesh. The blood faded. That was definitely not normal.


I stood, paralyzed, as he stalked forward. The thing cracked a grin, revealing stained sharp teeth, black eyes narrowed. He knew that I was terrified.


*Guns dont workkk*.


Suddenly, I heard a shout behind me:


BAD *DOG*!


Brewster came through for me just this once, hefting an armchair over his head with mighty roar and heaving it at Garden Tool. The monster tried to duck away but the chair was too large and it smashed into his body, trapping him back in a corner. Black blood began to pool around the chair and his twitching limbs.


The three of us stared at the bloodied armchair.


Is he dead? I asked.


The armchair moved and in a split second the three of us tore up the stairs while Garden Tool was incapacitated, stuffing ourselves back into my moms bedroom closet.


Why the hell didnt we run outside? Mildred asked angrily at us.


We cant worry about that now, I whispered. I turned to Brewster. Bro talk. What do we do?


I dont know, man, Brewster sniffed. Tears appeared in his eyes. Im scared, bro. Guns dont work. Chairs dont even work.


Brewster, well get through this. I grabbed his hand. Remember the power of friendship. I love you, brother.


I love you too, dude.


Okay. What do we do?


I got the keys to my car, we just need to get to the front of your house.


How? Mildred whispered angrily, cutting into our heartfelt friendship fest.


A distraction, Brewster whispered. How about I jump out, start flapping my arms and meowing


Garden Tool threw the closet door open, screeching in fury. I screamed and for once in my life, had a good aim I shot him directly in the mouth; he jerked back from the force, screaming in pain and frothing blood.


*EVERYONE MOVE*! Mildred howled, pushing us into a run. We barreled to the front of the house, Garden Tool springing up and tearing after us.


I leapt through the busted front door and shot out into the winter night, stuffing myself into the passenger seat of Brewsters car. Brewster and Mildred followed suite, Brewster taking the drivers seat and Mildred tumbling into the back of the car. I cocked the shotgun as Brewster struggled to take his keys and stick it in the ignition.


Brewster, MOVE! I yelled.


He blinked back tears. Im scared!


I pulled him into the passengers seat, jamming the shotgun into his hands and shoving myself into the drivers seat. I heard scrabbling outside the car.


Garden Tool leapt onto the front of the car and then smashed its head on the windshield. I gunned the engine and floored the car forward; Brewster blasted a bullet into the windshield, missing Garden Tool completely and blowing a massive hole in the car. Glass exploded everywhere; I threw my arms up to shield my face as Garden Tool forced his torso through the broken glass, screeching in my face.


HIs breath smelled like, guess what, surprise, that rotting meat smell that followed him everywhere. He was about to lunge at me when Mildred shot up from the back seat and threw something around his neck, pulling back.


Garden Tool shrieked, choking, scrabbling to untangle itself from whatever was choking it. I caught a glimpse of the rope for a split second, a crucifix charm dangling off of it. A rosary.


Mildred let go of the rosary and Garden Tool fell back from the front of the car. I rammed the gas and the car roared before shooting forward, running over the creature with a satisfied thump and roll of wheels.


We burned rubber onto the street, shooting into Baltimore city. Mildred looked back and saw Garden Tool for a split second, slowly rising from the ground. She flipped him off.


MILDRED, DONT TAUNT HIM, I screamed back at her.


Whatever, mom!


I drove blindly, flashing past side streets and continuing deep into the city. The more people, the safer. Okay, Mildred, where the hell do we go?


Im kind of hungry, she mumbled. McDonalds?


You said that religious items hurt him? All religious items? Whered you get that rosary?


My grandpas church. The Korean one out in the county.


Can you tell me how to get there?


Sure, but well have to bust in.


I dont care. If you think its safe, were going there.


Mildred gave me a look that wasnt the most confident thing I wanted to see, but I steeled myself and turned onto the highway, out of Baltimore city and back into religion.

Just great.

[Part 2](http://redd.it/16kxtb)

*Does anyone know any good warrior priests? Asking for a friend...just kidding, I'm asking for myself in order to not get killed. Without further ado...!*
__________


Mildred and I sat opposite one another in armchairs as Brewster struggled to cut up the pineapple into manageable chunks. Mildred wasnt as terrifying as before, now seeing her in the light although she still had chronic bitch face. Im not using that term in a sexist manner she truly looked like she was constantly pissed. The clock ticked on the wall. From the moment she dropped the pineapple between Brewster and me, Mildred had not spoken.


So I paused. Whats with the pineapple?


She shrugged. I was hungry and figured you guys had a knife to cut it up. I was just coming back from the farmers market when I started following you two.


I cringed. Brewster brought over the bowl of pineapple and began to set it down in front of her; she slapped his hand and took it from him, curling up in the armchair around the bowl. Brewster cowered into another armchair. For such a small teenager, she was terrifying. She started eating the pineapple.


Uh, I said. Wed really appreciate you telling us why you followed us, broke into my house and then told us that we were in trouble.


She nodded, disinterested. Yeah. Right. Okay. So. She paused. I hate to tell you this, butyoure being hunted down by a monster who wont stop chasing you until he basically rips you up and eats your dead body. She paused again. Im sorry.


I narrowed my eyes. Excuse me?


She sighed. Let me phrase this another way. Has your phone been acting weird?


I nodded.


Smell ofmeat in the air?


I nodded.


She ate another piece of pineapple. Giant gray dog-man at your door? She quirked an eyebrow. He said your name?


I nodded once more.


Yeah She looked into the bowl. As I said before, youre pretty much screwed. Sorry.


Brewster and I exchanged glances. Uhwhat? Brewster managed.


She snapped a glare to him. And its your fault.


His face fell. Huh?


 You stole my hacked Pokmon game that my idiot senile grandpa decided to leave outside. I hacked that game myself. It had a girl as a main character and everything. Im assuming Mr. Nerd over here she wiggled a piece of pineapple at me. played it.


Brewster nodded meekly, avoiding looking at me.


I gave Mildred a skeptical look. I dont see how this relates to all the shit thats going on.


She steepled her fingers *a la* Doctor Evil, turning to me. Frederick. You and I are not that different. Did you used to sleepwalk as a kid? To weird places?


A lot of people do that, I muttered.


She rolled her eyes. Yeah, well, a lot of people dont see figures at the foot of their bed at night. She mustve seen me look like Id just pooped myself, because she chuckled. Theres a lot of weird things in this world. Ghostsgoblinsghoulsand only certain people are affected by them. And these things are very nasty. They dont respect humans as apex predators. She gestured to the kitchen back door. Like Garden Tool.


I did a double take. Like who?


That gray thing that came up to your door. She rolled her eyes. The grand council of internet virgins uses the name the Rake and writes fanfiction about him. I dont know, its stupid. It was a toss up between Hoe and Garden Tool, and I liked the less vulgar one. More clever, you know?


I blinked at her. This was before I started posting on Reddit. I was never exactly a horror aficionado, but the fanfiction I read never involved Naked Gray Dog Men. That was a subject I did *not* want to touch.


If Garden Tool says your name Mildred made a chopping motion with her hand. Youre good as dead. She paused. Except for me. I attribute my survival to my intelligence and charm. Her eyes snapped to mine. But you have something of mine, yes? The game?


I nodded.


Well, it looks like he followed that scent and has a new plaything. She shrugged. Now both of us are screwed.


I threw my hands out. You keep on saying that so casually!


Its pretty easy to talk about death once youve accepted it as so, she said cheerfully.


There was silence for a moment.


I can try to help you guys out, Brewster mumbled guiltily.


I turned to him. Goddamnit, Bre


The powerful stench of rotting meat hit me and I stopped; Brewster and I both registered it at once and turned to Mildred, our eyes tearing and sleeves over our noses.


Yo, dude, Brewster whimpered. Its that smell!


She wrinkled up her nose, putting the pineapple bowl aside. This isnt good.


What the hell do we do? I asked desperately.


The doorbell rang.


All three of us looked to the front door, still overpowered by the rotting smell. It was about 3 AM. My mom was on a business trip. Who the hell would be at the door at 3 AM?


Brewster jumped up from his seat. Who is it


Brewster, you idiot! I grabbed his arm and pulled him back, picking up the shotgun from the side of my chair.


I inched to the door, looking through the peephole.


Darkness. Not the darkness of night, but pure black with a glass sheen. My mind worked to figure out what I was looking at, when I suddenly realized in horror what it was.


An eye.


Oh, shit! I scrambled back just as the door began crashing on its hinges, battered by something huge. Cracks raced across the wood and I cocked the shotgun, aiming it at the door.


I have no experience shooting a gun, I said, cowering behind my armchair. Meanwhile, I think Brewster wet himself.


Mildred sat up in her chair. We need to leave. Now. Get a car; itll catch us on foot.


The door was almost down. I dont have a car.


Mildred looked at Brewster and he shook his head, trembling. Mines in the front.


Shit. She tried to knock the gun out of my hands. Dont even bother, that wont work anyway.


My eyes bugged at her. *What*?


We need, like, holy water or some religious shit.


*YOU TELL ME THAT NOW*!? I shrieked.


The door fell down with the splintering of wood and a huge crash.
The three of us shot behind behind one armchair to hide, which was both stupid and ineffective. I heard claws scratch against the wood floor as whatever broke down my door walked into my house. There was silence for a few moments, coupled with wheezing, before I heard a familiar, rasping voice. I knew instantly what had just broken down my door.


*Meeeaattcome outtt*.


Garden Tool.


____________
*SHIT GOT REAL! I'm confirming that Brewster did pee himself when this happened. More on the way.*

*Frederick here. Wow! I really appreciate all of your guys support! I also really appreciate how many idiots there are on Reddit. Regardless, I figured that I owed you all more information. I realized in my last post that I threw you into the story a little late. Sorry about that. Luckily, Ive had another chance to write down some more background info. Once again, I apologize for any semantic errors.*


My name is Frederick Ellison. I was named after the great black abolitionist, orator, and thinker Frederick Douglass. I guess my mom expected another great black thinker, but all she got was a really nerdy, skinny kid who keeps solid grades and shares a love affair with Pokmon.


I had a pretty normal childhood, or so I thought. You know how you think somethings normal until someone else tells you differently? Well, I thought that everyone woke up in the middle of a cornfield on Friday nights, or sleepwalked to the basement door every Tuesday night at approximately 2:47am. Even when I would stay over at Brewsters house, despite the absence of a basement I would walk downstairs and just stare at a wall. Brewster found me once and took a few photos before making me a sandwich in an attempt to wake me up. Dont ask me how that wouldve helped.


Occasionally I would wake up and find humanoid shadows at the foot of my bed, staring at me with white pinprick eyes. I also happened to have a chronic bedwetting problem. No coloration.


These episodes stopped once I reached 14 and dropped religion, but the one constant that stayed was Brewster. Brewster Wellington III Sr. has been my friend since we accidentally exchanged saliva by teething on the same binky. We played sports together; I did his homework for him in French class; he punched a guy in the face for me. The correct term for our friendship is heterosexual life partners.


Consequently, it was Brewster who sent my current situation to shit.

____________
Yo, dude, garage sales! Brewster exclaimed, eyes wide at the number of garage sales in the small neighborhood. Ive heard that this street has some pretty sick deals.


If you say so


We puttered around a local Baltimore neighborhood in his souped-up Jetta. Despite Brewster having enough money to feed a small 3rd world country, he still pimped his ride like white trash a loud exhaust pipe, tinted windows, etcetera. I slumped low in my seat as Brewster turned up the volume on a piece of dubstep that couldve been mistaken for a dial tone.


I poked my head up to spy a neat-looking garage sale off to the right. Hey, Brewster, that one


NO, THIS ONE! Brewster screamed, jerking the wheel to the left. The car swerved into the driveway of an older brick house, and as I braced myself on the car door I noticed that there was only one table out in the open garage. The house looked empty, lights off and overgrown weeds choking the doorstep.


Brewster, theres one table and no ones there, I muttered.


It was calling to me, dude. He jumped out of the car. Come on! Well score some sweet deals.


I got out of the car just as Brewster was checking around the house and calling if anyone was home. He spotted me and came running with a huge grin, holding up an old Pokmon Blue game. Check it out, dude! Majorly old-school Pokmon game!


Whered you get that from?


The table!


I looked to the table in the open garage. It was completely empty. That Pokmon game must have been the only thing there, which was bizarre on its own level. I frowned at the empty table, noticing the strangeness of the situation. Brewster seemed to catch my uncertainty.


Hey, dude, you dont need to hang around, he said. You can wait in the car if you want and Ill just put the game back. This is weird.


I shrugged and got back in the car; Brewster returned a few minutes later and quickly pulled the car out of the driveway. We headed for my house for a night of watching reality TV, but as we drove closer and closer to my house I noticed Brewster beginning to perspire.


I furrowed my brow. You okay?


Just as we were about to pull into my driveway, Brewster gripped the wheel tighter and stared ahead. Uh, dude? He paused. I have a confession to make.


I quirked my eyebrow at him.


Uh, you know that Pokmon game that we just looked at?


*Yes*


WelluhI took it.


I turned to him as he pulled into my driveway. You stole it?


He parked and pulled the game out of his pocket. It looked so cool and no one was there and, I mean, you love Pokmon too!


Sure, but I dont steal shit!


His face fell. I just thought itd be cool.


I looked away. Whatever. Im not playing the game.


A few hours later I was playing the game, noticing the increasingly strange phenomenon not characteristic to Pokmon. All of the NPCs had blood spurting from their eyes and most of my Pokmon automatically named themselves DEATH or BEWARE. The main character was a girl, and her name was always Mildred.


You chose a weird-ass game to steal, I muttered to Brewster, but then noticed that he wasnt sitting next to me anymore.


I looked up to see him staring out the window. Yo, dudedo you have a dog?


Thats when shit hit the proverbial fan.

______________
As soon as the Naked Gray Thing ran away from the back door and Brewster stopped pissing himself with fear, we both looked at each other and screamed. We hit high octaves in horror.


*WHAT DO WE DO*? he shrieked.


I dont know. Calm down. I grabbed his shoulders. My mom keeps a shotgun in her closet. Grab that and come back downstairs.


He bit his lip, resembling a massive infant for a split second before running upstairs. I heard his footsteps banging above my head before they stopped abruptly. It didnt sound like he stopped to open the closet it was as if he was startled by something and froze in fear.


Brewster? I called hesitantly.


Uhdude? His voice was high with fear. Do you have an adopted Asian sister?


I frowned in confusion before busting it up the stairs, bursting into my moms room to see Brewster frozen in the middle of the room, staring out the window. My moms room has a small balcony, and on the balcony stood a small, thin Asian girl. She was about our age with straight black hair and a face that couldve killed someone. Her downy brows sharpened low over her dark eyes in a mask of rage. For some bizarre reason, she was holding a pineapple under her arm.


I stared at her for a moment. How could she have accessed the balcony? This was all too much to take in at once.


Are you lost? I shouted at her. Why do you have a pineapple?


She continued to stare.


And then she took a step forward.


Im not sure if it was her furious expression, the fact that a strange girl just appeared on my moms balcony, or the fact that a weird naked gray thing had just attacked us, but Brewster and I both rushed into the closet and jammed ourselves inside. I grabbed the shotgun wedged in the back and cocked it, aiming it at the closed doors of the closet.


Im scared, Brewster whimpered.


Shut up, I muttered. Its just a girl. With a pineapple.


I cracked the closet an inch to look outside.


Looking into the space was the girl.


My heart stopped and I fired the gun wildly, the base slamming into my shoulder as bullets riddled the room and smoke filled the air. Brewster screamed and jumped on me in fear, knocking the gun away. As the smoke cleared, the girl still stood before us, unharmed. She merely dropped the pineapple on the floor between us. We silenced immediately as her furious expression changed into a deep frown.


All right, you idiots, she said. Youre in trouble. Cut up this pineapple for me and well talk.


Oh, and the name is Mildred.

*Hey, everyone. You can call me Frederick.*


*You know when you hear a word and then it follows you everywhere? Well, I picked up something paranormal one day and thats exactly what happened. Its a little more complicated than that, but Im trying to write a good story here, so bear with me. Or bare with me, if youre feeling frisky. Har har. I try to keep it light and lively even when Im being hunted down.*


*Now, Im not the best writer ever, Im actually more of a fanfiction guy (NOT lemon). Feel free to give me some tips, but lets be real here: Im dealing with the embodiment of pure evil and I dont have time to check my metaphors. Sorry about that. Maybe if I survive and dont come out of this completely bonkers, Ill review and revise. But, Im digressing. My story starts with my best friend, Brewster.*

_


 Yo, dude, Brewster said, looking out the glass doors at the back of my kitchen. He pushed back his baseball cap and scratched his head. Do you own a dog?


I looked up from my Pokmon game, frowning. It was about 2am and the neighborhood was quiet as death, but leave it to Brewster to find my empty backyard more interesting than a haunted Pokmon game. He was a textbook jock; a distressingly tan lax bro with muscles the size of Texas and a brain the size of a tube of chapstick. Somehow, we were friends. I paused the game to grab a fistful of popcorn. Hell no, my moms allergic. Its probably a stray.


It looks really sick, dude. Its creeping me out.


Just close the blinds.


I dont want to, he whined.


Jesus, we just found a Pokmon game where blood spurts out of characters eyes. You see strays every day!


I dont know, now its like foaming at the mouth He cringed. *Ughh*.


I rolled up from the couch, grumbling as I dropped the Pokmon game and walked up behind Brewster. He seemed terrified for someone who could probably snap any dog in half. Look, you moron, the I stopped as I looked out the door and into the darkness of my backyard, lit by a few garden lamps.


That was definitely not a dog.


That was definitely a naked gray bald man crouched in my backyard, drooling and staring at us.


My face screwed up in confusion. Again, leave it to Brewster to think that some poor homeless man was a dog. Aw, crap. Im calling the cops. Thats not a dog, thats a homeless guy. And hes probably mentally ill, its not his fault.


But he growled at me!


I was already dialing the Baltimore City Police Department, ready to explain that there was some naked guy in my backyard at 2am. The dispatcher clicked on the line.


*Baltimore City Police Department, state your emergency*, a calm female voice answered.


Good evening, uh, I live at 126 Woodbird Drive. I looked back to the glass doors; the homeless man was still firmly rooted on my property. Um, there appears to be a naked man in my backyard.


Static suddenly crackled to life in the background. *Could you give me your address, please*?


Frowning, I gave her my address again and waited for her to respond. Silence; except for static and an occasional pop. I thought that I had lost the call but there was still no dial tone.


Hello? Mam? HELLO, MAM? I shouted into the phone. THERE IS A NAKED PERSON IN MY YARD.


*Where are you going*?


What?


A loud pop echoed on the phone before the same tone repeated itself:
*Where are you going*?


Mam, are you on drugs? I asked, that being the only plausible explanation at the time.


*Come back*.


excuse me?


*Come back*.


Suddenly, out of nowhere, the thick smell of rotting meat clogged the air. Both Brewster and I gagged; he stuffed his sleeve over his nose and looked back at me fearfully. Why does it smell like hamburgers?


Hell if I know!


His voice turned fearful. Its the dog!


Brewster, *shut up*!


I turned my attention back to the phone, but the woman continued to repeat the same phrase over and over again.


*Come back*.


*Come back*.


*Come back*.


Can you connect me to the Baltimore county office? I asked politely.


The women was about to respond when Brewster let loose a high-pitched shriek; I whipped around to see the homeless mans face pressed against the glass door, snarling. I gaped at the visage and my eyes bugged. My mind struggled to process the face. That was definitely not a naked homeless man.


The thing had hollow, black eyes and a canine snout; its curled lips revealed dozens of stained fangs. A few gossamer hairs grew on its emaciated head; the rest of the body gray and taut, the spine stuck out on its back. At this point Brewster crumpled up on the ground, sobbing and repeatedly screaming MOMMM, as the thing brought a huge, bloodied claw up to the door.


I dropped the phone, the womans voice now only reduced to something that sounded like Latin, or Japanese, Im not really sure. The phone clattered on the counter as the Naked Gray Thing and I stared at one another, I shocked and horrified, it evidently enjoying scaring the crap out of two pathetic boys. After what seemed like hours, the things face crept into a huge grin and it paused to rasp two single words. Although the glass door muffled the sound, I heard the two words as clearly as if they were whispered in my ear:


*Frederick Ellison*.


Brewster stopped screaming and jerked back to look at me in horror as the thing shot off back into the darkness. I swallowed.


*Oh, shit.*


That was my name.

*Okay, so maybe I use too many semicolons. So sue me.
Looking back, though, I suppose I threw you into the story too late. I got a little ahead of myself. Im sorry, obviously my jimmies are slightly rustled. Let me backtrack a little.* </TEXT>
