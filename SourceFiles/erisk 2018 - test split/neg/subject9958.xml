<TEXT> So there is a "past me", a "current me", and a "future me" in a never ending battle. The "current me" always hates the "past me" because the "past me", when in the "current me" state, did not care about the "future me" and therefore did w.e. he wanted and let the "future me" deal with it. So now I'm currently me and I got screwed yet again by "past me". I will inevitably become "past me" myself and there in lies my dilemma.

I want to end this vicious cycle, but since "past me" screwed me and I only have so much time to enjoy being the "current me", I may need to make some decisions that the "future me" won't like. But since by the time the "future me" becomes the "current me" I will already be the "past me", does it matter what the "future me" thinks? It'll be "future me's" problem and I would be ok.

Will this cycle ever end? Does anyone else have this issue? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My issue is there is a past me, a current me, and a future me in everlasting battle. The current me always hates the past me because the past me, when he was the current me, does not care about the future me. Therefore, the past me, in his current me form, does w.e. he wants and let's the future me deal with it once he becomes the past me. So now I'm current me and I got screwed yet again by past me. I will Inevitably become past me, therefore I will enjoy my time as current me and do w.e. I want because that is future me's problem. 

It's a vicious cycle. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Seriously guys. How you do not see that this blackout can only negatively impact the game at worst, and not impact the game at best, is beyond me. We have already bought the game and they are already trying to fix it. If the community bands together to go long stretches without playing, then why would they keep putting resources into the game when they can just move on to the next project?

Look at the rate of improvements with the playerbase somewhat intact, then imagine the screeching halt that could come if the playerbase suddenly vanishes. 

Seriously people. Grow up. You want to retaliate? Retaliate with your wallets. Don't buy steel. Don't buy season pass. But continue to play. If the playerbase remains the same but steel sales drop immensely then it will incline them to do better and increase those steel sales. But if not one is playing the game at all then why bother?


TL;DR don't be lazy. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Nooby looking for guidance/advice on my firs telescopes </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-30 19:54:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all.

I've always had a fascination for space and have finally made the decision to buy a telescope. I have my eye on two at the moment and wanted to see if you all had any thoughts on answering the follow questions, of which I will preface with the follow:

1) My budget is up to $550 with wiggle room,  but the lower I can get that without sacrificing much the better.

2) I will mostly view moon and planets since I will be viewing with lots of light pollution, but I have good spots I can drive too for deep sky sessions. So I'm looking for something reasonably easy to move and capable of both.

Right now the two I've found that I have my eye on are explore scientific ar102mm for $549 with a mount included. 

The second is a cheaper one, Orion 9024, with a mount included for $280.

Now, I will mostly be looking at planets, but I want to be able to see deep sky objects as well since I will occasionally make the drive to do so. Will these scopes provide a clear imagine of planets and objects? I've seen some uploaded pictures of Jupiter for instance on some scopes and although I can tell it is Jupiter, it isn't as clear as I'd like. 

Do you guys think either of these can get the job done? Or, do you know better scopes around the same price? I do not mind slightly breaking the budget if it's really worth it.

Thank you all for your time reading and chiming in.






TL;DR Orion 9024 , explore scientific ar102mm, or your recommendation? Budget $550 with wiggle room. looking for both deep sky and planetary viewing, mostly planetary. Please read post  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think there's a flaw in yours. With an angry, dwindling playerbase why would you dedicate resources to the game? You've already sold 90% of the copies you could ever sell (assuming some people buy more with sales).

 The profit you'd gain from steel would be a numbers game since most people that buy steel are casual and most likely gone at this point with only the biggest fans and more "hardcore" gamers still playing, which from my experience hate microtransactions; the numbers are not in their favor. So if the player base suddenly drops by half or more after it has already dropped so much, why would you dedicate money and time for small profit when in the greater scheme of things you can just work on new games? Updated and support for this game will drop if not completely worst case scenario, best case scenario as op stated they continue as normal. 

This strike can only hurt the game.

<TEXT> I truly don't understand why there's so much hate for this game on Reddit. If I never got on Reddit I wouldn't even think anyone hated this game lol I have 4 friends who play with me and none of them use Reddit. All 5 of us have loved the game from hour 1 to now our each 100+ hours of game time. We get disconnects here and there sure, but not so often as to take away from the experience. 

Yes coming up at first we would get beat on by some 108s, but once we figured out how revenged worked it was manageable and something we wanted to strive for. Seeing these geared out beasts dominating the battle field just gave us an urge to play more and attain that level of power. And beating a 108 in a 1v1 encounter in a close Dominion match accounts for many of my early on, epic feeling, moments.

All in all the game is great. There's a learning curve sure, but it's still a unique experience that can't be experienced in any other game at the moment. My friends and I LOVE this game. 

Maybe we're lucky since we have great internet so never really DC when we play. Maybe we didnt look at 108s as a nuisance and more as a goal to achieve. Watching them destroy 2 or 3 of us did nothing but teach us not to go in guns blazing all the time. 

TL;DR Game is amazing for my friends and I and not sure why it gets so much hate. It's really a great experience.

<TEXT> It definitely can. I as Conqueror do it somewhat often. If I dash right for a SB people's reaction is always to dodge left which is the furthest away from me to go for a light since dodging in my direction almost guarenteed I bash them. anticipating this I hold my guard left after I dash so that my shield is ready to auto block a light if they dodged.

<TEXT> I'm just saying what worked for me. Yes you'll get trashed in Dominion at first, but it's by far the fastest way to see the most variety of characters. If you duel and get trashed by a PK and they don't rematch you. It'll be who knows how long till you face another. At least in Dominion you can run into that PK a few times through at the match and even if you get ganked you atleast see what she likes to throw at you alongside who ever else was there to gank you.

Not saying I'm right or my method is best. Just simply stating how I see it and what personally worked for me.

I did Dominion exclusively before ever joining a duel and have done fairly well in duels given the fact I knew most if not all the characters by then. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bots my friend. Play against them until you destroy them and then move to Dominion. 

Why Dominion? Because it's 4v4 and you get to see a lot more characters and their kits and strengths and weaknesses. Once you know what to expect from all of them duels becomes a lot more manageable. You shouldn't lose so much as warden since they are very top tier if not the toppiest of toppies in topville </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's why I don't duel unless it's for contracts. I understand environmental kills are a thing. But, when some characters are significantly better at environmental kills and you get set up on a map against them which heavily favors environment kills it's not really fair or fun. Especially when a shugoki charges you and there's cliffs on either side of you and you just die without even being able to do much. Again, I don't mine environmental kills, but in a duel it shouldn't place you on a damn bridge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I'm not going to stoop to your level since you are obviously a child that can not have a discussion or express their point of view without demeaning the opposition. You can enjoy 1v1 and I'll respect your right to, but just be aware that not everyone agrees with what you're saying lol. I don't find 1v1 a skillful display of breaking anyone down. I see 1v1 as a starefest of who attacks first and gets countered then owned. I find Dominion to contain the true skill and forces a player to consider many variables while utilizing every aspect of their character in order to succeed against 1, 2, 3, or 4 enemies all at once while still trying to achieve victory by using map control and strategy. 

Well agree to disagree, except for Dominion or Duels being 'retarded'. They each have their crowd. Enjoy the game because that's what we are all doing in the end of the day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agree with most. Just think the orochi needs something more. All he can do is parry and deflect but that's a defensive stance. He really has no answer to a defensive character and I think needs a bit more. Maybe make deflection slightly easier to make it more useful? As it stands his light after deflect is trash and his heavy after deflect can still be interrupted or countered even though it shouldn't be.

Edit: I know my suggestions don't help him against defensive characters but it'll at least make his defense somewhat formidable since his offense is a joke once you know their kit. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How afk farming can be fixed. Without bans. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-10 13:23:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just wanted to say that I understand why people need action. I personally do not experience this really because I play with a full team every night and therefore no one on my team farms, and I think it's mostly in PvE which I never do anyways.

But, I also understand why these farmers do it.
I can't tell you how many messages I've gotten from salty players who are trying a new character, get smashed by my 108 conq, then message me that if they were on their main I would've been killed.

That is the problem right now. With how the game is structured you are punished when leveling a new character because your gear is so low and you get matched up against people with a very high or maxed out GS which means they have plenty of experience with that character.

Now, I also don't find this terrible personally but I can see the argument. 

Instead of Ubisoft warning, then suspending, then banning, which I do not agree with. All they need to do is kick players who do not ready up before a match. This will simply kick anyone who is attempting to afk farm.

TL;DR Just boot anyone who doesn't ready up before a match and you will stop afk farming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is if you want to try a new character you get smashed by 108s and purple's.so the ideal and fun thing to do is play on your main when you're home and then afk farm the new character while you sleep or go to work.

I don't afk farm myself because I personally only like 1 character but for those who like playing multiple this is really their only way without pulling their hair out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are more of us than you'd think. After guard break change on console it has been impossible to open up any that turtles up besides feinting which is nice but not unique to the orochi. Other classes have bashes and pushes and charge attacks and unblockables etc to throw at you when you aren't buying the feints. The orochi ONLY has feints. That's not acceptable. </TEXT>

I see they can cater to the competitive scene and watch their player base dwindle until the esports scene for the game takes off, which is questionable.

Or, they can cater to the majority of the player base which is casual, and have a higher chance of increased player size since more casuals will try and love the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never understood balancing around the best players either. Look what happened to StarCraft 2. It's so catered to the professional scene it makes the barrier of entry immense and therefore the game is dead outside of competition play for the most part.

I'm sure Ubisoft will not only cater to high level players since frankly that makes up but a small fraction of the player base. They need to cater to the average player, the casual player, and not the "pro" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been leveling my orochi lately and after the update I noticed a big problem. Hopefully some of you can enlighten me, but as an orochi fighting let's say, a conqueror. What do I do to open them up if all they do is block and wait for me to attack?

It used to be before I would GB them for an over head heavy into a ZA for hard damage. But now if I GB they CGB and if I don't attack they don't either. This leaves us in a stand still of no one wanting to attack. 

As an orochi with the new GB implementation how in the hell do you open up someone that goes 100% defensive on you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> And then followed it up with:

Roman Campos Oriola:I personally think Revenge is completely mandatory in a group fight scenario. The issue you're facing in group fight scenarios is that you're getting overwhelmed and constantly interrupted. So you need a tool to be able to make the difference.

The goal behind the Revenge is if you're able to survive a little bit, then you will have a tool that will allow you to make a difference - but only for a short period of time. You need to time well your activation, and have a clear strategy for how you're going to use it, because you get that chance and after it's over.

In a group fight scenario it works well, and today when we look at the data about kill/death ratio in group situations, we are in a spot that I think is interesting. When you're against two players, one time out of three you can survive. When you're against three players, it's one out of five on average.

The tough part has always been to find the balance where when you're ganking someone, you need to feel that you're going to kill him, and it's not bullshit because you're actually two on one, or three on one. And when you're that person, you should always see the light at the end of the tunnel, like, yeah, maybe I can take one or two with me. Maybe sometimes - rarely - I can actually win. I think Revenge serves that purpose well.

In Duel it's an interesting debate that we had internally. Personally, I like Revenge in Duel. Why? Because Revenge is a little bit like the Ultra in Street Fighter. It's an event that happens at some point toward the end of the fight. It does not happen every time. But it completely changes the mind games at that moment. </TEXT>

So I started IF yesterday after a few weeks of reducing my meal portions and dieting. I'm eating my first meal at 12 and continue to eat until around 8-10 depending on when I go to the gym, so on average I fast between 9-12pm for a total of about 15 hours of fasting.

Basically I'm just looking for any tips and advice as I begin this lifestyle. What can I expect? What would you have done differently knowing what you know now?

Any help would be great! Thanks! </TEXT>

High skill players tend to move on to other characters more often since they play more often, and in those encounters I do well and even dominate at times due to the fact my gear is so much better than theirs. </TEXT>

<TITLE> People need to realize gear stats aren't bad and either is Dominion </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just want to start by saying that I see Dominion and gear stats get a lot of hate on this sub. Most of the complaints are about gear stats and balance and competitive play and feats and the list goes on. 

Now, I understand that most people on this sub play a lot and therefore are pretty good at the game. I also understand that by being good at the game you get annoyed when someone not as good as you are, but with far better gear, beats you solely because of their gear.

However, I draw the line when people CLAIM that gear stats are ruining the game. Let's take Overwatch as an example. Recently it underwent many changes that affected only the top their of players and did not affect anyone in bronze, gold, or platinum. Do you know how much of the player base falls under diamond??? 85%. That means that most players are casual and not highly skilled.

I feel the same goes for many games, and for honor is no exception. I'm not the best player around and I gladly accept that. My schedule and life only affords me an hour or two of game time, about every other day, and that's fine. When I sit down to play do you think I want a super balanced always competitive fight where multiple enemies mean certain death and a 1v1 against a really good player means I lose always?

No, if you're good at the game and are trying a new character, and I'm using my main with 108 gear, I WANT to be able to hang with you and beat you even if it's ONLY because of my gear. If the only way I can get an insane quad kill is by dropping a catapult on your team or if you are guarded a ladder so we can't climb up and I take you out with a heat seaking guided  arrow, so be it.

Gear stats are fine, they make the game fun and interesting for players of all skill levels, especially for casuals who make up most of the player base. Denying these players the ability to feel bad ass, win, and win consistently enough to warrant continued play means they will move on to the next fun to play game, leaving your beloved competitive game a Barron wasteland of inevitable death.


TL;DR gear stats are fine because they help casuals who make up most of the player base. Don't claim GS ruins the game when in fact it makes it enjoyable for all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why so? If you compare it to the price of a movie ticket let's say, 2 hours for 10 bucks. That means all you need to play to get your money worth from a 60 dollar game is 12 hours. Given the fact that you'll most likely go well above 12 hours you're getting better value than a night out in the movies by a long shot. Especially that I myself am already approaching the 100 hour mark. This game has infinite value and is well worth 60. </TEXT>

Instead of getting knocked down by someone with revenge let them use it and back away and pick your shows and GB and play defensively until it runs out and that's it. Me and my friends always destroy people with revenge, yes we are 108s with high gear but getting there isn't that hard lol people just like to complain about anything now a days and don't like fun.

<TEXT> I totally agree. It's unfortunate, in my case, to have pretty much cycled through all variants of my conquerer helmets by the time I hit rep 3 that when I geared out I didn't get that "bad ass" vibe because I looked so similar to how I did when I was just turning rep 2. It does add minor details but I wish there was a more unique style to them. All I can say is maybe when * pieces release for the other armor pieces they will be highly unique. Just kinda wish that was the case currently. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You not living will NEVER be better for anyone. Never think or say that. We all go through tough times because we all go through good times. If you have never experienced happiness then you wouldn't know you were sad because you'd have nothing to compare it too. And without a bit if sadness we wouldn't appreciate the good.

I started college when I was 18, by 21 I dropped out. Years passed where I thought I was a failure while watching friends go on to bigger and better things. I eventually went back and graduated, 6 years later at the age of 27 with a degree most people I knew had by the time they were 22. 

But I did it, and I'm happy now. It wasn't in my area of original focus, I changed majors many times, but found something I truly enjoy. It took me years to really self reflect and mature as an individual before I was able to tackle school again. In that meantime I worked dead end jobs and had no degree. But now things have changed.

You do not know where you will be in 1, 2, 5, 6 years. Life always has ups and downs. You will always have downs. But you will also have ups. Taking your life is never the answer. Just consider what you are facing and compare it to someone else. Look at Stephen Hawkings condition and he continues carrying on. Your situation can always be much worse and there are always people in much worse situations maintaining a positive mindset. 

Just being alive and being able to see a sunny day or rainy night, feel the wind, eat, sleep, laugh, think, be bored. Anything is better than nothing. And becoming nothing by taking your life will only being pain and suffering to those you love.

Keep on pushing forward. Life might seem bad now but it won't always be. Take it from someone who earned a 4 year degree in 10 years. I can relate. The feeling if disappointing people sucks. But that's that all there is to life. Learn to ignore it and move at your OWN pace. Your pace may be similar to mine which is a bit slower than average, but that isn't bad, just different. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a conqueror here and PK never really give me a tough time. Being slow you need to be the one who plays on reaction. I camp side guards at mid range to bait the over head lunge, block, GB side heavy and try for a shield bash to test their skill and see if they dodge or just get pummeled. Smarter PKs won't go for that but I throw it out there. When I'm rushed I just pick a side and block it. It becomes a guessing game with how fast her LA are so I just pick a side and hope it's the first, second, or third strike they throw, at which point you can parry, GB and repeat. I like to charge my heavy periodically at a distance just to keep the at bay and then dash to a side to cancel out of it. Believe it or not going into your infinite to cover distance and throwing out a heavy when somewhat in range lands occasionally and can catch people of guard. I use this to start funneling them in the direction I want, bottom line you want to force her against a wall so that your shield bash heavy combo because inescapable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I prefer minimum duration because I rather go into revenge more often rather than stay in each interval of revenge longer. The best part of gaining revenge is making the opponents timid since they can get knocked down. That alone gives you momentum. And once you use revenge and fight them off you can more quickly get out of that state and threaten with another revenge immediately after your quick super Saiyan outburst.

Just my opinion though and how I like to play.

I'm a conqueror if that helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rep 3 conqueror with GS of 108 and I will say gear DOES matter in 4v4. Obviously it is dependent on player skill because I have beaten people with 40+ GS in a 1v1 with gear stats enabled and my character having a GS of 0, but getting to the higher GS is a whole other ball game. In a 4v4, if you or two, or three even of your teammates surround my conq I can easily handle and kill all of you because of how quickly I gain revenge, how hard it is to kill me, and how much damage I do. Even if you find me alone and we 1v1 I can still get revenge if I block a couple of your hits. 

But don't let this turn you off to the game. Not many people you run into are at a 108 GS and therefore not everyone exploits revenge builds so you will be fine 95% of the time in 4v4. Duels, for example, do not use gear stats and unless you have best of the best gear they will not affect the outcome aslong as you are a more skilled player. </TEXT>

I'm a pretty high level conqueror and only time I charge my heavy is for safe parry. Never to just charge it and lose stamina for no reason, makes it pointless since any good player will not approach you if you're just charging it and a better player will feint you. Once your expecting a feint if they GB you instead you can't tech. Basically, never just charge your heavy for no reason. </TEXT>

His block is the best in the game sure, but he has a giant shield I'd expect it to be better than everyone else especially since his light and heavy attacks are the weakest in the game lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just be defensive and reactive. His shield bash heavy combo is nice for 50/50 since you can follow the initial heavy with a shield bash or another heavy, if they dodge expecting the bash you get a hit in, if they expect a hit and block and it's another bash, by that point they're stamina drained. Especially if you GB off a parry into a shield bash you can quickly exhaust opponents. I like to attack their stamina rather than their health at first and I really open up on them once they're exhausted. Works for me maybe not for everyone? And also something to use sparingly is using full block as a feint since you can't feint. Wastes a ton of stamina though so be careful. 

He has very safe parry as well. Just hold your heavy on parry. If they feinted all you did was charge a heavy. If they go for an attack at that point and you release the charged heavy with parry timing your superior block will still block the attack and you'll get in a guaranteed charged heavy. If they didn't feint initially then you parry them and go back to the original strategy.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically when they go for a heavy and you parry it that automatically drains some of their stamina, if you follow it up with the guaranteed GB and then do a shield bash rather than a light or heavy, watch how much stamina you drain off of them. It highly limits their offense. I follow it up with the side heavy and try to go for another shield bash and start that shield bash 50/50 game to get them in exhaust range. If they dodge you still put them on the defensive at that point and you should be able to react accordingly depending on your opponent.

Edit: by shield bash I mean forward dash into shield bash immediately after a GB. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just wanted to see what I'm not seeing here. I'm a rep 3 conqueror and have been reading through what people think of all the classes and I always see conqueror a lot lower on most people's lists than I would expect. What am I not seeing here?

In my opinion conqueror is an extremely strong class even in duels. The fact your blocks stop chains and, on parry, if you follow up with a shield bash after a GB, you essentially drain all of your opponents stamina. By applying even light pressure at that point you can pretty consistently exhaust them and drop them to the ground to open up for big damage.

Now of course you need to take a defensive style to achieve this, but I mean you're a guy with a shield, defense is implied. Some people may choose to force you to make the first move and avoid your defense all together until you give them an opening, which is fine by me and preferred honestly.  If you use your infinites to get in close, safely, and use full guard to occasionally "feint" and mix in dashes into shield bashes you can pretty much force your opponent to retaliate with offense or get bullied around. Once that happens well, I just said it above.

So of course I lose. I don't always win. But I win enough against all classes that I don't believe a conqueror to be a poor man's warlord, but rather a top tier class.

What do you guys think? Agree? Disagree?



TL;DR: Conqueror is stronger than people say he is. RAW RAW RAW RAW RAW RAW </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, that's kinda how they played before so nothing's changed. A good kensei will circle you with pokes and parry into GB to start their combo anyways as far as I'm aware. And CGB hasn't been changed to the point that any one can mindlessly CGB. If you're feinting and poking and throwing out the unexpected GB you will still land on less experienced players. Against more experienced players they would've CGB anyways, I see this only affecting GB spammers who  only relied on GB for their damage. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-02-28 15:24:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just wanted to say you need to be realistic. You think just because guard breaks work a certain way in competitive play that it shouldn't be changed to accommodate players at lower tiers, which is 90% or more of the total player base?

Unless you want the game's community to die and development to cease completely because of the lack of profit then you should make the game as suitable to new and casual players as possible without completely destroying the depth of the system for the higher level players, which is what I think is happening here with the guard break changes.

A higher level player will still destroy a new player, but atleast the new player won't get GB to death and have a frustrating experience like has been the case with that whole system.

I personally do not mind if a casual player can CGB me, either way I GB when I get a free one and I'm still going to out play then and win regardless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is something I've noticed as well. If you can CGB an orochi it's pretty much over. Storm rush is easily blocked. If they go for their side dash attacks you know exactly where to block. If they get in close just camp high guard since they're only quick move is that double over head. Everything else can be reacted to other than that so just block how, CGB, and you won right then and there. Once I mastered the timing on CGB against orochi they have never ever beaten me again in a duel since other than a GB into a heavy for big damage they don't really have any other mix ups. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This doesn't make sense. Because as a conqueror I am nothing without a solid defense since all of my attacks are extremely slow and weak. If they nerfed my block they'd have to seriously buff my offense. But then why bother playing a shield class if I'm going to act as any other sword wielding DPS class? I pick the conqueror to play exactly that way, turtle behind a shield and methodically break down an offensive character with my shield and batter them with my slow flail. 

Punishing blocking severely punishes us shielders. Unless these changes only affected blocking with a sword I feel it would render the risk reward of a conqueror, for example, not worth it therefore making him kind of unplayable. It's hard enough as it is reading feints and CGB until I find an opening with a conqueror as is without taking big damage on successful blocks. If 70, 50, or even 40% of damage went through it'll completely break the game once you start getting spammed into oblivion by assasins. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I don't see the big deal either. I always stand away with high guard Incase they lunge. And if they get close I do exactly that. I hold block left and it'll happen, either first or second hit, GB them, shield bash to drain some stamina. And start pushing the pace. Repeating that pressure I either make them run or drain them of stamina and start doing hard damage. Conqueror main here. </TEXT>
