<TEXT> I can't say enough good things about this movie. Everyone in it gives 110%. Mike Myers, Nancy Travis, Anthony Lapaglia, Alan Arkin, Amanda Plummer, Phil Hartman, Steven Wright and more. It boasts a great soundtrack as well. I'll be honest in that the final act falls apart a bit but it's still such a great moive. My whole family quotes this movie almost on a daily basis. I hope the younger generations will give it a chance and get to yell, "We have a piper down" for many generations to come!!

Fun Fact : IIRC this is the last movie that Mike Myers was in without wearing any type of facial prosthetic. 

Edit: Don't judge the film by the trailer. It's horrible. Here's a better clip that features Mike Myers playing the part of his Scottish father. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKRFlNryaWw </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's really a few reasons that all come together to make it a great gaming experience. Firstly the music. The music in the game is so memorable and really makes you feel what's happening. Like Frog's theme for example. Such a good song for a "hero that has risen from the ashes" so to speak. Or Magus's dark theme song that is simple but mysterious at the same time. 

Another aspect to the game that makes it so good is how polished and complete it is. From all the little details in the backgrounds to mini games and side quests all with deep back stories that can alter time lines. There are multiple endings to the game so the replay value is there as well and "New Game +" is a nice touch.

The artwork of the game garnered a huge following alone and rightly so. The characters were designed by Akira Toriyama also known as the creator of Dragon Ball Z. His animations back then were some of the best coming out of Japan and had a huge impact on how Americans viewed Japanese Animation.

The main story line was very fresh when it came out and still holds up today. Everything went right for this game and it's ok if you aren't that into it. I remember my brother in-law buying the game when it came out along with the guide and even just watching him play was captivating at the time. I'm in the middle of a play through right now and I'm using a pdf file of the official Brady Games guide along the way for any secrets I may have missed in the past. I highly suggest playing the game with a guide your first time to help you progress with the story and to get the most out of the game.  While it may seem similar to other JRPGs of the time Chrono Trigger is *thee* JRPG of the time.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Mask (1994) Great use of Practical and Special effects that still hold up today while Jim Carrey captures the essence of classic cartoons. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-24 16:11:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I decided to watch this movie last night after not seeing it in about 10 years. Jim Carrey nailed the role and in my opinion no one else could have even came close to his performance.


As I watched I was mesmerized at the way he delivered each line as the "Mask". It's like he was born to play this role. He is a walking cartoon and it worked perfect in this movie. I like the night and day aspect of him being a "serious banker" during the day and a cartoon loving man child at night. Every little mannerism he does just adds to the charm of the character. His voice was amazing and I'm honestly surprised he wasn't used as a voice actor more often. 

I was around 10 when the movie came out and absolutely loved it as a kid. So many quotable lines. Not to mention Cameron Diaz at the beginning of her career looking very beautiful. The film has an overall "noire" feeling that adds to the Nostalgia as well. Carrey was also in Dumb and Dumber and Ace Ventura in the same year. Say what you will about his career recently but there is no doubting he was a comedic genius in the 90's.

So treat yourself to watching The Mask again. It's a very fun movie with awesome special effects and it's great for the whole family as well.

Here's a short clip to show off some of the effects and chops of Carrey. For those who have not seen the film, spoilers ahead: https://youtu.be/7fTavlU7-rs </TEXT>

You can write about what characters you liked, what scenes you enjoyed, what you would have done differently, or about what you didn't like. After doing this for a while I wouldn't be surprised if you start getting better at it. Observe *everything* in every scene not just dialogue.

If you enjoy complicated time travel rules check out Primer. I'm not saying it's perfect, but it's a lot better than the mess that Looper turned into. 


That being said, I thought the cgi done to JGL's face was better than most facial cgi we get.

<TEXT> I remember thinking I'll never have a *movie* blow my mind like that ever again, and that there would never be a better science fiction film in my lifetime.

20 years later I still haven't had a mind blowing movie experience like that again. Closest I can think of is Everest (2015). Something happened inside me while watching it months ago that I can't explain.

The Matrix is still my favorite science fiction with many runner ups.

edit: I need to make it clear that what I felt by Everest was very personal and quite difficult to explain. I'm in no way saying Everest is a mind blowing film to the likes of The Matrix. The affect the movie had on me was mind blowing.

**Don Draper** writing the Coka Cola ad after staying with the hippies in the series finale of **Mad Men**. At first I was like wait.. . did he write that? .. .that's it, that's the closure we get, another ad. Then I started to think on it a bit and I think that ending scene actually did give Don Draper the character, the closure he deserved. 

Overall I was blown away by the whole series. When telling my friends about it I refer to it as *Nick @ Nite rated R* </TEXT>

<TEXT> For whatever reason this movie doesn't get the love it deserves. I will say the trailer makes it look very dry and soulless but it's quite the opposite. It's perfect for this time of year and it's actually really funny. It really nails the feeling of being a kid mystified by a haunted house in your neighbor hood.  Whether you watch it by yourself or with the family it's really enjoyable.

edit: Another user pointed out that Dan Harmon of Rick and Morty and The Community wrote the movie which is another reason to check it out if you're a fan of his work. Thanks u/OneManFreakShow

<TEXT> Whistling is now to be used only as a form of interspecies communication.

I'm a whistler. My cat thinks when I whistle it is only to talk to her and she comes running up to me and starts talking to me in what I can only describe as "closed mouthed meows". We'll talk for a few minutes like that multiple times a day. </TEXT>

I grew up with Roger Clemens MVP Baseball and it was pretty fun. The computer was definitely a challenge but not impossible to beat. It was certainly funner to play with a friend. 

I rented The Frank Thomas one and I remember being blown away at the graphics *right off the bat*, but as you said, it was too difficult for preteen me to really enjoy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, him being shot by Chewie's bow def made a difference. The main reason tho is that Kylo is not as powerful as he thinks or as we were led to believe the first half of the movie. Another reason could be Rey is simply the best we've ever seen at picking up on the force untrained. Anakin could sense the force as a small child before his training.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You were supposed to think Kylo was a badass until Rey beat him. He's not a badass...yet. He idolizes his grandfather, Vader which was a badass. Also he had taken a shot from Chewies bow, which was seen making storm troopers do back flips. I agree about the pacing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_from_a_Rose)

"Kiss from a Rose" is a song from Seal's second eponymous album. The song was first released as a single in July 1994. Re-released in 1995, it was included on the Batman Forever film soundtrack, helping it top the charts in the U.S. and Australia. At the 1996 Grammy Awards, it won awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.[1]

Apparently, not original music for the soundtrack but being re released on the OST for Batman Forever gave it its fame. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This sub seems to be interested in Opening Montages or Intros if you will. Here is one of my personal favorites from honestly my favorite remake.

Apparently Johnny Cash and end times go hand in hand. The shots of real life riots mixed with the takeover give a really creepy vibe and snippets of genes mutating fit right in. I really like the shots of news teams reporting from the scenes.

If you haven't watched this movie or hadn't *planned* on watching this movie during October Check It OUT.

Old : **Stargate** (1994)

Both of these movies are near the top of the Sci Fi genre in my book. They are both very different but very enjoyable. I really don't like Tom Cruise movies but that being said Edge of Tomorrow was brilliant from start to finish. Stargate sparked my fascination with ancient Egypt as a young boy.

When you do a roll that was written for you, you don't really need to "flex" your acting muscles because that part obviously comes easier to you. I like to see the skill in acting.

<TEXT> I think it's pointless. It's not Nintendo licensed just like the emulators you can get for handheld devices. Even the guy who  owns a retro gaming shop in my area said emulating on your phone or tablet is better if you really must have SNES on the go, and he said they are not selling for shit. 

It looks too big to play comfortably for more then 15 -20 min. Where would you use it the most? Maybe a road trip.? I dunno. The screen is small as hell and some games wouldn't even be enjoyable or playable without really squinting. My honest opinion is that it is a stupid product that isn't needed at all but some people will "have to have it." </TEXT>

My older sister got Aladdin for SNES one christmas because she was in love with everything Aladdin back then. Right away we noticed the games mechanics were 10/10 and the levels got better and better and more fun as you progressed. The Genie's levels were my favorite so I made a up a dumb little jingle to remeber "Genie, Jafar, Aladdin, Abu". 20 years later and I still randomly sing Genie Jafar Aladdin Abu.

<TEXT> I keep hearing this but I actually have never played Altered Beast but remember the box, the ads, and the hype around it. I grew up Sega-less so ...yea. Is it worth checking out via emulation? We literally never had a Sega in the house. I played Genesis at a friends house and I played DreamCast at a friends house. I fucking loved Sonic (Genesis) and Crazy Taxi (DreamCast) and bout shit my 14 year old self when I found out DreamCast had an internet browser. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Dad was the first one of us to beat the first castle on Super Mario World. We had just got the system that day and when he beat it he stood up and put his arms up and started a victory lap around the house. It was cut short when one of his hands got caught in the ceiling fan for a good 3 seconds. I'll never forget that noise.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks. Brand new sleeping bags sell for $20 and up. This bag is 30 plus years old. You sold it at a great price but I guarantee you I can get $50 for it today If I wanted. I've already been offered $45 from someone who knows what I paid for it. In the coming years they will become more rare since they are falling apart. If by chance MOTU gets a Hollywood reboot then the price will jump again. </TEXT>

This bad boy was selling on Ebay 3 years ago for $20. The only open sales I could find were for $50 for one with stains and $115 on Etsy with 1 in stock. Zipper works like new. Colors are like new. It's a piece of art in my mind. I may hang it up long ways because the artwork is just so vibrant. Gotta love Thrifting!!! </TEXT>

In fifth grade, I knocked my sister Edie down the stairs and I blamed it on the dogWhen my mom sent me to the summer camp for fat kids and then they served lunch I got nuts and I pigged out and they kicked me outBut the worst thing I ever done  I mixed a pot of fake puke at home and then I went to this movie theater, hid the puke in my jacket, climbed up to the balcony and then, t-t-then, I made a noise like this: hua-hua-hua-huaaaaaaa  and then I dumped it over the side, all over the people in the audience. And then, this was horrible, all the people started getting sick and throwing up all over each other. I never felt so bad in my entire life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> * Samurai Shodown - Classic Japanese style fighting game in the box for around $20 on ebay. 
* Star Fox - Must have in any collection $14 buy it now cartridge only ebay. 
* Mario Kart - the O.G Mario Kart for Snes , worth the extra $10 it goes around $25-$30 cart only ebay. 
* Donkey Kong Country 2 - just as good if not better $20 cart only ebay. 
* Doom - one of the first fps games besides Wolfenstein 3d also for Snes, the latter is my favorite however Doom goes for $20-$25 cart only on ebay while Wolfenstein 3d (Nazi and Hitler references) goes for $35-50 cart only on ebay. 
* Super Smash TV - this game was way ahead of its time. Very quoatable one of my personal favorites $20-$25 cart only on ebay.
* If you buy these games it will definitely look like you know what you're doing. The list of great games around $20 is too long to list but these are a few off the top to start building a strong collection.

<TEXT> This is NOT the pull string version. His jacket looks like it was once sewn at the buttons to keep it on. Now the jacket comes off. Some kid decided to draw over his eyebrows and lips with what looks like black magic marker. His white shirt has some light brown discoloration. I bout shat myself when I saw it today at the Goodwill here in town. I had the pull string edition when I was young and thought that he would have it but he does not.
    How can I get the marker off his face without taking his original paint off? I could sand it right off but his red lips and true black eyebrows will go with it. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!
    Buy it now on EBAY looks about $15-$20

<TEXT> * This is NOT the pull string version. His jacket looks like it was once sewn at the buttons to keep it on. Now the jacket comes off. Some kid decided to draw over his eyebrows and lips with what looks like black magic marker. His white shirt has some light brown discoloration. I bout shat myself when I saw it today at the Goodwill here in town. I had the pull string edition when I was young and thought that he would have it but he does not.
* How can I get the marker off his face without taking his original paint off? I could sand it right off but his red lips and true black eyebrows will go with it. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!
* Buy it now on EBAY looks about $15-$20 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you'll have the guys that love them and have been "waiting" for them and you'll have the guys that don't want to take away from the nostalgia of retro gaming. That being said I think a consumer edition would be cool, but will it change retro gaming? No. Will they sell some early on? Yes. IMHO </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's between Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland for me. Apparently zombies and humor go hand in hand. I heard a story about Woody Harelson attacking a guy in an airport and saying he was still in the mind set of fending off zombies from a movie he had just wrapped... I wonder if it's true. Shaun of the dead had a sense of realness to it that I really liked and I really could identify with the step dad bits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really like the ["Thumtrac" Birdie by Innova.](http://www.innovadiscs.com/discs/putt-and-approach-discs/speed-1/birdie.html) It's great for aggressive putting and the grip, well it's in the name. I've only heard about them until a recent trip to Sports Authority. I picked one up for $10 and the accuracy I have with this thing is literally unbelievable. It's definitely worth a gander. All I used pryor was my Aviar and I loved it. The Birdie has improved my putt and approach game so much that it's the clear choice over the Aviar for me.  </TEXT>
