<TEXT> Hey guys. Newbie both to this thread and bonsai. Received a mass market Juniper for my birthday about a month ago, and just bought a Dwarf Jade today that I'm pretty sure was a rip off but I couldn't resist. I would love any advice (soil, shape, watering, etc) for the juniper and the jade (if it is even worth keeping).

Here's the Juniper: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/itZp0QU.jpg)

Here's the Jade: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/lo3b0o5.jpg)

I'm sure this is obnoxious but please break down any bonsai terminology a la ELI5 so that I can grow and not ask stupid questions in the future. Thanks so much!!

EDIT: I just set my flair but just in case; I live in NYC </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ramen, probably.

In all seriousness though, that's a helpful story. Reminds me of the serenity prayer. 

"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference."

We can't always change everything about our circumstances, but we can always change our perspective. And I know I'm guilty of simply allowing myself to be overwhelmed by hard seasons of life, instead of taking the time to see what hard work I can do to make those seasons better, and maybe even create some beauty.

<TEXT> I am pretty shocked by the racist comments on this thread, though with the anonymity of Reddit I suppose I shouldn't be shocked by cowardice and childish humor. Latinx creatives are responsible for some of the greatest film of our time. Cuaron, Lubezki, Inarritu. Latinos make up 17.6% of the [population](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2016/cb16-ff16.html), almost a fifth of the total US population. From a purely statistical standpoint, "Hispanic" audiences matter. I am saddened by the ignorance and condescension showcased in these comments, but I have faith in the strength of the creative and enterprising spirit of Latinx Americans such as myself and my family that worked hard to create opportunities that allowed my love for film to exist. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Since we brought up Pendragon.. Anyone else read The Keys to the Kingdom series by Garth Nix? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-29 23:26:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> These books completely engulfed me as a kid. Definitely one of those situations where I hated coming to the end of each volume because the next part of the series had not yet been written.

The mythology that Nix creates is so compellingly well crafted and yet so very accessible. Obvious religious parallels abound, such as each of the seven Trustees being afflicted with a particular sin to match the seven deadly sins (Mister Monday: Sloth, Grim Tuesday: Greed, Drowned Wednesday: Gluttony, Sir Thursday: Wrath, Lady Friday: Lust, Superior Saturday: Envy, Lord Sunday: Pride) or the idea of "Nothing" being an actual material substance from which the entire Universe was formed.

Each of the 7 unique keys and their powers, the 7 separate realms of "The House", the 7 Trustees, the 7 dials, the Nithlings, the Old One and the Architect (as well as their three sons), all the characters and moments which exist as mythological or literary references- all these things come together to create an incredible and unforgettable ride through "The House".

The books are nowhere near as dense as Harry Potter or LOTR but, for me, the mythology was just as intriguing. Perhaps even more so because of the brevity. One of my favorite and most nostalgic YA book series. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Guardians Vol. 2: could the fact that the marketing lacks a villain with strong presence be the reason the hype seems somewhat subdued? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-18 05:58:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yes. I realize the hype is real and present, but it seems to me that the hype is generally much more subdued than I expected it to be especially after the unexpected success of the first film. And I say that as someone who LOVES the first film, has seen it an embarrassing amount of times, and currently has a GOTG poster hanging on my bedroom wall. 

The marketing thus far hasn't really presented a singular villain. We see Ayesha, but there isn't really a threatening or iconic presence of villainy surrounding her. And I don't mean a campy presence, but in comparison to other villains like Loki, Ultron, Vulture, Winter Soldier, etc. she just doesn't seem to have a powerful presence. I realize that she is likely not the only foe the Guardians will face, but maybe the reason there isn't more hype is because we don't know what our heroes are up against? 

So that's a theory I came up with while mulling over reasons I'm not as excited as I thought I would be for the sequel to my favorite Marvel movie so far. (Still gonna me midnight premiering it though. See you there.)

<TITLE> Can anyone shed some light on a directors process in animated films? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-05 05:45:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> With live action films I understand rehearsing a scene, running it, stopping and starting and taking time to give notes and suggestions. A director can see his actors in relation to the set or setting in real time and adjust accordingly, or take a look at the image he's capturing and make changes. 

How does all of this work with animation? Does a director work both in creating the images we see as well as giving direction to the voice actors? How much of the animation artists work is dictated and/or shaped by the director?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welp. I did not expect to wake up to this thread having somewhat blown up. Thought there would be maybe 10-20 comments and that's it. I am surprised at the intensity of some of the criticism, but we're all fans here and I know how these discussions get the blood flowing. 

I am a fellow fan of Marvel movies and comic books. I've seen every film in theaters (most more than once) and I've got boxes of comics in my closet (including a box full of the One More Day/Brand New Day run that I can't bring myself to throw away for some masochistic reason). Guardians is my favorite (I've seen it over 50 times- how embarrassing). All this to say, I was not setting out to make absolute statements or judgements. I just wanted to throw out an observation I had. 

Thank you for the comments reminding me that SMH is not an origin story, and also that the Netflix heroes/villains exists. My qualifier for the movies I included in my list were solo debut MCU films centered around one hero, regardless of whether they are traditional origin stories or not. The Guardians are a team. DD/JJ/etc are TV heroes. Spidey appeared in Civil War but this is his solo debut. I know that I threw Vision in there, but that was more of an after thought that extended the observation I was trying to share.

I understand the backlash about Thor and Loki, but like I said below, even if they're removed from the list it would still leave 5 origin stories where the heroes face mirror versions of themselves. Which is not something I am looking to judge. If you read my initial post, I don't have anything negative to say about those villains. The First Avenger and Iron Man are some of my all time favorite MCU films. 

All I was trying to say is that I'm excited to see Marvel taking a slightly different route with Spidey and placing him in so many scenarios we haven't seen on film thus far. Thanks for your discussion and feedback, this sub is the bees knees. Much love, True Believers </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I agree that Thor and Loki is the biggest stretch, but the fact that they're both Asgardian Gods is nevertheless a similarity, which is the point that I was trying to make. It's not just a part of their names, it's what they are. Also I didn't include the Guardians because much like The Avengers, their story is the origin story of a team of heroes, not a single hero.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Iron Man fought Obidiah Stane in a big, gray Iron Man suit, with the same tech and power set. The Hulk fought a big gray Hulked up Abomination. Thor, God of Thunder, (ultimately) fought his brother Loki, God of Mischief. Captain America fought The Red Skull, transformed by the same "super soldier" formula. Ant-Man fought Yellowjacket, another man powered by Pym Particles. Doctor Strange fought Kaecilius, a rogue sorcerer. And even Vision fought against Ultron, another physical manifestation of an AI.

Meanwhile, Spider-Man will be facing off against a high tech flying dude, a dude with high tech gauntlets, and the Tinkerer (who is pretty high tech). Nothing against the previous villains, I just think this is an exciting change for the MCU.

And yes, I realize they're skipping the spider bite "origin story" but for all intents and purposes it is an origin story as far as establishing a solo story for Spidey in the MCU.

<TEXT> I actually mentioned this exact point in a comment below. The thing is, the article is about roles, not about directors. Ironically the three Oscar winning films you mentioned don't have any Latino roles, and that's what this discussion is about. Just as one example, Michael Pea was the first Latino in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he had a minor role that was somewhat stereotypical. I do think Diegos role in Rogue One is a great accomplishment, though it is yet again a Latino with a minor role in a film starring a white lead  </TEXT>

We have incredibly successful people directing brilliant work, Irritu with Birdman and The Revenant and Cuarn with so many of his films, but we don't get to see Latino filmmakers producing work that champions authentic Latino stories. Though to be fair, both Irritu and Cuarn produced work involving their heritage prior to making big in the "mainstream" filmmaking industry. Same could be said of Guillermo Del Toro </TEXT>

<TEXT> How would you prefer the franchise be expanded? Would you rather see these films exist a sort of sci-if horror anthology that is more focused on atmosphere and genre, rather than a myth/universe building focus?

Genuine question as a fan of Alien, Aliens, and Prometheus myself. I'm not really sure how I feel about the expansion myself and I think this movie will probably be decisive for me in that regard.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I don't think that the author is arguing that John needs to become a character with legendary literary depth, I think the point he's making is that characters are most interesting and memorable when they undergo an arc. It's just a basic fundamental of storytelling. For example, while it's obviously a different movie, the characters in Hell or High Water are not particularly "deep", but they do have satisfying arcs, and that makes them interesting and memorable. 

I think the author is saying that it would be nice to see John have some kind of arc so that we can remember him as an interesting, well done character in an interesting and incredibly well done action film. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely. For me, the Hollywood pictures or awards advertisements just distract from what very well may be a wonderful book. A book should be free to stand on its own merits, not by association with a film, which is a completely different medium of storytelling. I very much often still want to read the book, and I'll hunt around the inter webs until I find an edition that isn't marred by advertisements  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Batman is the Pop that got me into Funko Pop. I actually got a yellow bat symbol chest print error as my first ever pop, but at the time I didn't know anything about anything, so he sat on my dashboard, baking in the Texas sun for two years.

Between all the redesigns of old pops releasing and the massive amount of miscellaneous Batman Pops coming out, do you personally feel there is any point in continuing to collect? The rainbow Pop had me a little excited, but personally, those redesigns make me feel like the originals I collected aren't as valuable anymore, and lately I've been struggling to decide whether or not I'm even going to bother continuing the hunt for ol' Batsy Pops. How do you feel about it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> "The problem was it goes on really great and it looks really great, but its really hard to get off. They came up with this idea: they stick me in a sauna at the end of the day. They literally have to melt it off of me. That was the thing, because during the test we found out its so abrasive they literally have to scrub it off of me. So after two days, my skin was like hamburger. So they came up with the sauna thing, and I literally have a portable sauna that travels around with me and I get in at the end of the day, and I get three guys who come in and attack me  nothing weird there. Four guys in a sauna, just being men. We talk about football and fighting a lot while were in there." -Bautista </TEXT>

Edit: also, I saw The Nice Guys at an Alamo Drafthouse and they played footage of Ryan Gosling as a kid dancing and acting and goofing etc. Only deepened my hatred for his undeniable likability and charisma.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Holy shit. You have to click this link.

The movie of King Kong is an elaborate allegory of spiritual evolution so we can understand the mythical quality of this story which also underlies the Lord of the Rings, the Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Cupid and Psyche and Sleeping Beauty.

We understand from King Kong what ancient symbols have been telling us of the hundred percent split nature of humanity and the necessity for purification, integration  and going higher through meditation.

Ancient knowledge of Splitness, the universal split nature of humanity through DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)  and MPD (Multiple Personality Disorder)  shown and proved by the 10,000 year old images of the split animal-human or ego-soul of the Centaur, Sphinx, Minotaur and Phoenix.

Or Anne Darrow-King Kong or Gollum-Frodo or Cupid-Psyche or Beauty-Beast or Sleeping Beauty-Prince or Cervantes Sancho Panza-Don Quixote and Frodo-Sam. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where are you from?

I am a Texan, and part of why I absolutely loved Hell or High Water was because it captured the character of Texas and Texans so well, and it did so without passing judgement on any of them. As a Texan, I can honestly say I didn't feel any of the characters felt like caricatures to me. From a writing perspective, all of the characters had believable and powerful motivations. No character was free of flaws or free of redemptive, honorable qualities. The plot dropped you right into the action without dwelling on exposition as many movies do. And the resolution was not a trite, happy ending. 

I also felt it was a wonderful second chapter in Taylor Sheridan's thematic "new frontier" trilogy. The first captures the current spirit of the border wars, and Hell or High Water captures the lingering cowboy idealism that still very much exists in Texas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did anyone else here read the book?

I think reading the book ruined it for me (as usually happens). I wish I could've seen it before reading the novel because I was waiting for certain lines or moments or monologues that didn't happen. I think if I hadn't read the book I would have loved the movie, but the situation being what it is, I didn't love it. 

I thought the cinematography was beautiful, and I really believe Scorsese was incredibly equipped to handle the source material as he is a Catholic himself. I thought he did a masterful job of capturing various crises of faith without pa seeing or bias. However, I found myself vacillating between being engrossed and feeling lost in the pacing. I'm not saying I think it was done poorly. It's not that my attention span was too short, I just had many moments were the material captured my attention only to linger for so long that my heart was no longer held by the scene. 

Overall, still a beautiful film brought to life in a way that only Scorsese could have accomplished.   </TEXT>

I said, "It hasn't left my hands since you gave it to me sir". He looked at it. "No. that's not my watch." I had no idea what to do. "Do you want me to get my manager, sir?" "No, I want my watch". We sort of just stared at each other for a while. After a minute or so he looked at the watch, put it on, shrugged, and said "I guess it is my watch" before walking out the door.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think a book that was written by dozens of culturally unique writers over the course of hundreds of years each influenced by the events and circumstances of their times is "very clear" about anything. To apply logic to immaterial and spiritual ideas quickly goes nowhere. I could easily choose to take those words to mean that the Dalai Lama would go to heaven because of his Christ like compassion, and that it would be Jesus who made that concession, thus the Dalai Lama achieved unity with "the father" through Jesus </TEXT>

<TEXT> Despite what fundamentalists might preach, almost every religion throughout all of history has espoused systems of belief based on emotions and enlightenment and an acknowledgment that the divine is beyond comprehension and renders logic useless. Religion has historically been much more about providing a vehicle for human spirituality rather than providing a strict, unchanging system of theology or doctrine. 

As such, it is perfectly within the capacity of a modern Christian who has chosen following the teachings of Christ as his/her preferred method of spirituality to also have the power of mind to believe that other spiritual pursuits might lead souls to "God". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for saying this. It's really encouraging to read that so many people have come to claim their identity independent of any outside perception, and it gives me hope, but it also left me feeling a little lonely. That outside perceptions is most definitely what makes it hard to be confident in my perceived identity, and leaves me confused when it comes to my own self perception. It's cliche, but amongst my white friends/peers I am the token racial outsider in every comment  in which race is relevant, and amongst my Mexican friends/peers I'm not Latino enough, I'm a gringo. So this leaves me at a loss when I'm alone trying to piece together my own thoughts of who I am or what I can claim as my own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I appreciated La La Land because it didn't go full cliche and have the destinies of the protagonists inevitably intertwine and end in realized romance. The film as a whole left me a bit emotionally disjointed, as it intertwined joyful exuberance with a sense of realistic (and perhaps cynical?) fatalism. However, the more I thought about it the more I felt that the film was simply telling a story and using classic, colorful, nostalgic musical theatre tropes as the medium for telling that story. La La Land is a story about two artists, but the lives of these artists do not present a philosophy of life or art . 

Paterson, on the the other hand, is the story of two artists that also presents a philosophy for art and life. For me it was about finding contentment and joy and art in the mundanity of day to day life. In some ways, it's the antithesis of La La Land. Whereas La La Land takes small moments of beauty and turns them into bombastic, over the top spectacles, Paterson leaves the small moments of beauty exactly as they are, and asks us to be on the look out for these moments precisely because they are small, and if we're not careful we might over look them. 

I'm glad to hear that Paterson holds up under subsequent viewings. I've been trying to convince friends and family to see it with me.  </TEXT>

Around my white friends I am the butt of every racial joke and am asked to translate or explain anything and everything remotely related to any Latino culture, regardless of the fact that I am half Mexican and not half Cuban or Guatemalan or Colombian.

Amongst Latino peers, I am too "white" to be considered Mexican. So I am the butt of most gringo jokes and occasionally get comments like "you really ARE Mexican" when I down a shot of mezcal or whistle cumbia tunes.

And that's a really solid comparison. I think the spirit of the film is what had me leaving the theatre in such a joyful mood. Personally, I've rarely seen films that champion contentment as powerfully as Paterson did. In a culture operating out of an economy of lack, it's refreshing to witness a film that suggests there is plenty all around us if we are willing to look.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Take a walk.

Especially for anxiety brought on by social situations- whether it's a large group or a one on one conversation. I've committed to making myself take a walk if my feelings become overwhelming. Separation from the situation doesn't magically solve anything, but it does give me room to breathe and calm down and I often return much more capable of handling the situation and myself.

TL;DR- I'm an introvert dolphin in an extrovert sea so sometimes I have to swim to the surface to take a breath  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In light of the new title reveal, it's still all I can think about. Where are all the other Knights? Did Kylo turn on all of them after they rebelled against Luke?  Do they all have the surname Ren? How were they strong enough to defeat Luke AND all the other Jedi in training? How many Jedi were there? Did any survive? Why didn't they kill Luke too? Are the films implying Luke ran away? Who the hell is Snoke and is he Darth Snoke or Snoke Ren and while I'm hypothesizing, Darth Kylo sounds stupid as hell. 

Sigh. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don't want to take the time to write one, just tell me what you think of mine ('wow ur so dumb") and/or speculate on what could have been ("Revenge of the Sandpeople?") 

Here's mine:

Terror is spreading across the Republic. After decades of peace under the leadership of General Leia Organa, a group of young Jedi called THE KNIGHTS OF REN have rebelled against the teachings of Luke Skywalker. Their seemingly random attacks have left the entire galaxy living in fear of where they might strike next.

In the face of his failure, Luke has vanished. Determined to restore order to the Force, he has embarked on a quest to unravel mysteries of the Jedi that have been unexplored for centuries.

Desperate to find Luke and protect her people, Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to Lukes whereabouts..

(PS- this is for fun. Not to incite chaos or anger. 
Anger leads to hate, hate leads to.. well, you know) </TEXT>

Apparently no one else saw what was happening because everyone around me was prepared to let the woman die. So. I reached over a row of seats, through the two people standing in front of me, and knocked the spider off her back and to the floor. Everyone looked at me in judgement for awkwardly swatting at a woman- but I knew what I had done, and I was at peace. </TEXT>
