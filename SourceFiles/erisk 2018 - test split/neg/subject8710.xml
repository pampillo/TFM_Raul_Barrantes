<TEXT> It's a transfer of capital in 99% of cases, clubs don't purchase debts or bonds. Typically, it'll be a lump sum payment however, with the figures nowadays clubs tend to pay over a period of time. I'm actually not sure if there's interest but you can look that up. And yes, they can afford to do that. A club like Barcelona makes enormous amounts of revenue per year that 90M is a fraction of their yearly revenue. Of course they have cash reserves and assets, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a Torontonian, I'll try to highlight some bars   clubs for you. Assuming you're into clubs, stay away from Rebel   Uniun unless you want to pay $50 to get in   another $150 per bottle. You should visit Muzik, Cube, The Hoxton,   Luxy. We also have Cabana Pool Bar which is exactly what it sounds like.  If you're into history   art, I suggest visiting the Royal Ontario Museum   Art Gallery of Ontario. If you're looking for theme parks we have Wonderland   Ontario Place. Finally, don't neglect the West end. There's shopping (Sherway Gardens), theatres, bars, restaurants, everything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey fellow Inter fan, if you have an offer from U of Ottawa - take it. U of Ottawa is pretty good school. However, if you get into McMaster University then take that ASAP. McMaster is one of the best schools in Canada and the world. 

If you decide to live in Ottawa then don't expect tons of clubs or bars on the scale of Toronto. As a Toronto native, I found Ottawa to be quite boring but then again, I grew up in Toronto. It's a quiet town but I'm sure there's still lots to do there. You aren't too far from Toronto anyways. Canada is vast and there's lot to do: camping, cottages, fishing, hiking, beaches, road trips, etc. And of course we have MLS, NHL, MLB, NBA, and such. </TEXT>

Hell, Total War: Warhammer has sold over a million copies itself nevermind the previous titles like Attila, Shogun, Rome, etc. That's more than Age of Empires   similar to C C games. Either way, RTS is almost synonymous with Starcraft so most people getting into RTS automatically look at Starcraft which is a good thing of course but the genre needs more competition. Halo Wars 2 is a start. A blockbuster franchise like Halo pumping out a sequel to its RTS spinoff is amazing for the genre.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-04-02 00:52:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not very familiar with Central European / Eastern European history but I am curious how Austria-Hungary became one of the premier states in Europe among competitors like Germany, France, Russia, etc. 

This map here depicts the Austria-Hungary Empire and it is quite [huge] (http://maps.canadiangeographic.ca/outbreak-of-first-world-war-map/images/Europe_1914.jpg).

How did the empire gain to much power, wealth, land, etc.?

According to this [source] (http://autocww2.colorado.edu/~toldy4/E64ContentFiles/HistoryOfEurope/Austria-Hungary.html
). The empire stood at 670,000 sq. KM which makes it bigger than modern-day France.

<TEXT> I often defend Manchester City because people hate new money like you guys   Chelsea but Stones cost 50M, man. Not dollars or euros, pounds. Manchester City should not under any circumstances be conceding 6 goals. 

Barzagli cost Juventus 300k for reference. Stones will never reach Barzagli's level. </TEXT>

As someone that's been following for over a decade, I can tell you that Halo 2 changed eSports. Prior to Halo 2 it wasn't really a big thing but once MLG picked it up it was quarter-million contracts, Red Bull sponsorships, etc. </TEXT>

I have question regarding fanbases throughout Germany. Now obviously Bayern is the most supported club by far but how is the fanbase of other clubs throughout the country? What would you say are the most supported clubs? 

Also, since there are so many clubs in the Ruhr, what's the breakdown like in the Ruhr itself? I know Leverkusen   Monchengladbach are small cities but do they have more support than other local clubs like Koln? Do folks from Essen support Schalke? Are Stuttgart   Frankfurt heavily supported since their cities are so large? And what's it like in East Germany? Is Leipzig heavily supported nowadays? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As an American, I don't get why people can't understand my love for Manchester United. I have supported Manchester United all my life and I'm entering 12th grade in Fall at my high school in Boston, Massachusetts. Manchester United symbolize football to me. Through their tradition, their history, the city of Manchester, the greatest British man of all-time Sir Alex Ferguson, and icons like David Beckham, Manchester United has drawn me and it is the club of my heart. I am finally booking my tickets to go to Manchester in November. Hopefully I can get tickets to visit Old Trafford which is in my opinion the cathedral of football. Although I was born in 1999, I can recall the class of '92 and how magical Beckham, Giggs, Neville and Scholes were on the pitch.

I can't stand these new plastic Manchester City fans though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Damn, that's one long interview. All my life growing up, I've always thought of Real Madrid   Bara as the "biggest" clubs. Because they were. They always signed the superstars and had the biggest revenues. Only recently as in the last few years have we begun to see English clubs as the biggest and it's thanks to the Premier League TV deal. Manchester United having been so successful during England's golden age in Europe (2005-2012) reaped the benefits of that hard. I don't know if Manchester United are bigger than Madrid or Bara but I think there's a lot of aura that surrounds the club from the plane crash in the 50's, to the dramatic treble in the 90's, to Sir Alex and his 20+ years at the club, etc. It's a club shrouded in aura that draws people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Here:] (http://www.football-oranje.com/are-ajax-on-route-to-winning-the-champions-league-of-1996/)

Giuseppe DOnoffrio, a well-respected medical expert, and Sandro Donati, a former athletics coach and an anti-doping legend. Both argued that documents seized from Juventus in the late 1990s were a dead giveaway of blood manipulation, either via EPO or, less likely, 1970s-style blood transfusions. (Both were banned in 1996 and remain so.)

United has the highest debt in Europe and at 400M it's the equivalent to half the worth of clubs like Arsenal, Juventus, etc. What happens when Glazer's decide to sell?

It's hilarious to watch Man U fans deny that spent nearly 80M for a teenager who was realistically worth about half of that (30-40M). Martial is a perfect example of inflation today and overpaying. For comparison, Barca spent 10k on Messi as a teenager. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Napolon   Hitler: Why'd they fail invading Russia? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As someone that isn't too knowledgeable about military tactics, military technology, military logistics, military supply lines, military innovation, etc. I'm genuinely curious why Napoleon's Grande Armee failed at invading Russia. Then Hitler's Wehrmacht failed at invading Russia this time with superior technology, equipment, modern tactics, etc. What are the reasons for this?

I'd also like to share one of my favorite quotes about Russia from Winston Churchill:

*Russia is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. It is a part of Europe and a part of Asia, yet separate from both. It is rich with natural resources, yet its people have historically been grindingly poor. It has been invaded and overrun by Goths, Huns, Mongols, French and Germans, yet remained uniquely Russian. It has been a superpower and a nearly failed state, a monarchy, communist dictatorship and democracy - all within a span of 100 years.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a Canadian and most of my understanding of World War II was taught from an America perspective in school growing up. However, I've been dating a Russian girl for some time now and recently we got into an argument because she tried convincing me America is "evil".


Essentially, she argued that America and Germany worked together post-World War 2 to keep Eastern Europe and Russia down via exploitation and the likes. Now, I am not too knowledgeable regarding this. I'm a business student in university and my WW2 knowledge is limited. She explained to me the Marshall Plan whereby America helped Germany and such. 

My question is: How exactly did America keep the USSR, Russia,   Eastern Europe "down" exactly?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't understand why you'd compare to Inter to Real Madrid or Bayern.

Inter aren't exactly winning everything right now. And Inter is a club meant for everybody regardless of race, religion, etc. It's a club with a philosophy - fratelli del mondo. Inter is a symbol of the Sforza family of Milan. Inter is a symbol of anti-fascism. Inter is tradition   history   unlike most clubs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jos Mourinho, no surprise. But no Jupp Heynckes? 

Mourinho won the first treble in Serie A history and Heynckes won the first treble in Bundesliga history - equally as impressive. He won the Intertoto Cup twice with Schalke   ended Real Madrid's European Cup drought since 1966. Heynckes also led Borussia Mnchengladbach to the UEFA Cup final. Heynckes deserves to be here. </TEXT>

Each of them have been dominant throughout different periods and sometimes simultaneously. 

I'd also like to give an honorable mention to Squirtle. While he's probably not the best Protoss player ever, the GSL final vs. Mvp was one of the best performances I've ever seen and I've never admired a Protoss players play like Squirtle. </TEXT>

For me:

- Korea 

I mean, it's Korea. Don't really have to explain.

- Canada

Been producing top-tier players for years such as Grrr, HuK, Scarlett, MaSa, KiWiKaKi, TT1, David Kim, etc. Won the 1st OSL, deep runs in GSL, and numerous premier tournament wins. 

- Not sure

The 3rd spot is why I made this thread. I feel like there are a lot of options here. The US nowadays but historically France, Sweden, Spain, Germany, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Taiwan, and others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been sad over breaking up with my ex earlier this year. However, in the last few weeks I met this 40-year-old milf. She's Eastern European, green eyes, blonde hair, big tits, pretty much the ideal milf. I never thought it would go anywhere with her but we ended up sleeping together recently and now I don't even think about my ex. I've learned that there are a lot of women out there so don't ever be hung up over your ex.

Eastern European women are the best. Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech, Austrian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, etc. are truly the hottest ethnicities in my opinion. Anybody else agree? </TEXT>

<TITLE> ELI5: How's Alabama been so dominant in the last decade? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-12 07:06:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As someone that doesn't follow college football due to the fact that we don't get college football games in Canada for the most part, I'm not familiar with college football at all. 

However, looking at the SEC Championship records since 2008, Alabama has been to the SEC Championship game 6 times and have won 5 times. What's the secret for Alabama's dominance from their players, coaches, tactics, staff, and everything in between?

Also, can someone provide some insight into how big football culture is in Alabama? How has Alabama's success in recent times had an impact on the University of Alabama and the state in general? 

Furthermore, which players from Alabama have gone on to be drafted in the NFL and have they been successful or unsuccessful? 

Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love how Real Madrid fans are obsessed with Inter all of a sudden.

Real Madrid might be a rich club, but there's no club in the world with as much capital as Inter. Unlike PSG, Man City, Real Madrid and whoever else, Inter's shares are all owned by multi-billionaires and multi-billion companies. Pirelli themselves wields an unfathomable amount of influence, you should probably read up on them. 

Inter has a long history of signing mega-stars anyways. The original Luis Suarez, Ronaldo, Crespo, Ibrahimovic, Figo, etc. Maybe not Messi, but why are other superstars not possible? 

As a Real Madrid fan, you should be aware of Inter's influence over players, too. Inter, Milan, Benfica and Real Madrid will always be the most historical European clubs   players are drawn to that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Throughout the years of Starcraft 2, we've had a ton of IEMs, Dreamhacks, WCSs, GSLs, SSLs, MLGs, KeSPA Cups, Homestory Cups, and everything in between, but what 1 tournament stood out as the best or most memorable or simply your favorite? 

For me:

I'd go with the 2011 GSL Super Tournament. 

The top 4 consisted of MarineKing, MMA, TOP and Polt and it just symbolizes the golden era of GOMTvT to me. There was even a K-POP performance.

Honorable mention: 

Razer King of the Beta

<TEXT> Here's an article I found from a few weeks ago: http://dairylandexpress.com/2016/10/17/packers-aaron-rodgers-brett-favre-comparison/

Honestly, the stats between the two are so similar it's really surprising. 

Take a look:

*Rodgers record in those eight years was 80-39 (.**672**) with a 7-6 playoff record, two NFC championship appearances, and one Super Bowl title.*


*In Favres age 25-32 seasons, he went 86-42 (.**672**) with a 9-5 postseason mark, three NFC championship games played, one Super Bowl title and a second appearance.*

Between the two, who do Packers fans, NFC North fans, and football fans in general feel is greater? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Favorite Halo pro of all-time? (MLG) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-13 17:44:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been following Halo since the early days of Halo: CE - like I'm sure a lot of you guys have been as well. I've watched so many different players and teams dominate throughout the years in each era (Halo 2, Halo 3, etc.). 

If I were to pick a favorite pro, I'd have to go with Tsquared. 

Final Boss was the most dominant team in Halo's history by far but T2 and his team, Str8 Rippin, were just as dominant and even better at times. I remember watching T2 on MTV's True Life and along with Walshy, he signed a quarter-million dollar contract with MLG - a first in eSports if I remember correctly. T2 always had personality and skill which I why I liked him.


Honorable mentions: 

- Ogre 2 

The most winning-est player in Halo's history. The numbers speak for themselves. Ogre 2 was one of, if not the greatest slayer to grace the game. 

- Karma

4 of the top 5 highest-earning Halo 2 players were from Final Boss. The other 1 was Karma. One of the other greatest slayers to grace the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me personally, I'm a huge fan of Starcraft and always have been (see username) but it wasn't the first eSport I got into.

Back in the Halo 2 days, I got heavily into Halo and the Halo eSports scene. With Halo came organizations like MLG which further propelled the popularity of Halo. I remember teams like Final Boss, Str8 Rippin, Carbon, etc. who were the prominent teams in those days. Fast forward to Halo 3 and the popularity of Halo got even bigger with tournaments all over America. And, as far as I can remember, Halo was the first eSport where we saw mammoth-sized contracts in gaming. I remember Walshy, Tsquared, etc. signed MLG contracts for a quarter-million dollars. In the mid-2000s, that was ridiculous money and even today, that would still be considered ridiculous money. 

Halo for me will always be one of the pioneer eSports in terms of what it did for gaming and what it did to legitimize this sport that we all love.  </TEXT>

According to TIME magazine, the reparations Germany was ordered to pay equal [$402 billion] (http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2023140,00.html) in today's money which is a ridiculous amount. I'm interested in how did Germany go from broke, battered, and ruined overall to a global superpower yet again in a mere 2 decades after the end of World War I.

<TEXT> According to this data from [Forbes] (http://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2014/03/21/want-to-know-the-language-of-the-future-the-data-suggests-it-could-be-french/#8ed714239331) :

French was lingua franca of the world to the point where all countries in Europe spoke French - even aristocrats in Imperial Russia spoke French. This [book] (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230597037_6#page-1) states that King Louis XIV (1600s) is responsible for the rise of French as the world's lingua franca as he demanded French replace Latin in Europe as the language of commerce, diplomacy, etc. French also remained the lingua franca of the world for centuries well into the late 19th century and early 20th century. It still remains the official language of the UN, the EU, the Olympics, and FIFA however it obviously isn't the lingua franca of the world anymore. Although it is still spoken over a wide area from France to Belgium, Switzerland, central Europe, Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Canada.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the late 19th century and early 20th century, what were the reasons behind both of these world powers losing to Japan? A smaller nation population wise compared to both nations and had *much* less natural resources than either Russia or China. 

I couldn't find an .edu source but...

according to investopedia.com (http://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets-economy/090516/10-countries-most-natural-resources.asp) China and Russia both rank among the top 10 countries richest in natural resources. The disparity between the resources Japan had compared to what Russia and China had was huge. Therefore, what were the reasons both Russia and China lost? </TEXT>

One of my favorite RTS franchises is Total War. I put a shit ton of hours into Shogun 2 and Rome 2. I'd recommend Total War to anybody that likes RTS or strategy games in general. I also like how historically accurate Total War games are from the tech tree, units, etc. 

Fun fact: Creative Assembly, developers of Total War, are making Halo Wars 2 </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-10-29 06:48:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A Google search reveals that Napoleon's Grande Arme consisted of approx. 680,000 men at Napoleon's height of power. Those numbers are impressive even by today's standards as the number of active personnel for countries like Russia, Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, etc. is around the same number. However, I know that size does not and never will win wars. What made the Grande Arme so successful in terms of tactics, innovations, formations, and things of that nature?

Napoleon even almost conquered the Middle East:

<TEXT> I'm Canadian and my first language is English and I know this is an English sub therefore we all may lean towards the British Empire in terms of historical importance. However, I also speak French and I'm aware that French is nowhere near as widely spoken as Spanish.

More people speak Chinese in terms of sheer numbers but all those speakers either 1. reside in China or 2. are Chinese.

Spanish and English are spoken over such a wide area throughout the world. Spanish is spoken in Europe, North America, South America, the Caribbean and other parts of the world. English is spoken in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, the Caribbean, etc. The official numbers put English and Spanish at both over 500+ million speakers throughout the world. 

Spain claims that they had the world's first global empire under Queen Isabella. England claims they had the world's biggest empire under Queen Victoria. Both empires were extremely wealthy and possessed powerful navies. The similarities between the two are endless. 

In relation to the time of their existence to their legacy upto today, which of these two empires would r/history consider to have a bigger legacy?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a Terran player, I enjoy a competitive PvZ from time to time. 

There has been some good PvZs throughout the years but I think my all-time favorite would have to be the 2014 GSL Season 3 semi-final (Zest vs. soO). Zest vs. soO is among my favorite rivalries in Starcraft history and they've had some memorable series throughout the years. soO defeated Zest to advance to the finals of the 2014 GSL Season 3 and one of the most memorable games I can remember was set 3 where soO proxy hatched on Overgrowth. I've seen a lot of Zerg players throughout the years but few have been as intelligent, cunning, and strategic as soO.

2014 was a year of Protoss dominance. Just to give you guys an idea, in the 2014 GSL Season 1 there was only 3 Terrans. From January until July there was a Protoss in every single premier tournament final. MarineKing returned after switching to League of Legends and was up against the Protoss at the forefront of Protoss dominance in 2014 - Zest. Zest won the GSL Season 1, the GSL Global Championship, semi-finalist of GSL Season 3 and was the finalist of IEM Toronto. And although r/starcraft 'experts' favored Zest, he lost. One of the best TvPs of all-time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having heard about Napoleon for years   years, I never questioned what made him the general he was. However, after looking into modern day revered generals (such as those from World War II) I'm curious about Napoleon. 

Now it's claimed Napoleon ruled over 70 million people in the 19th century which is quite a lot for the period and the [First French Empire] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/First_French_Empire_1812.svg/450px-First_French_Empire_1812.svg.png) covered much of western and central Europe. 

I'm familiar with Nazi Germany and the infamous "Blitzkrieg" tactic  among other German tactics such as the "Schlieffen Plan" but what made Napoleon the infamous general he is?

<TITLE> Russia vs. The Golden Horde </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-01 10:34:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From 1283 to 1480, almost 200 years, the Grand Duchy of Moscow was a vassal state to the Mongols (Golden Horde). Considering that's longer than the amount of time Canada has been a nation, the Golden Horde dominated Russia. 

I'm interested in how the Mongols influenced, shaped, and changed Russian history. First, how were Mongols literally the only persons able to invade Russia successfully? Batu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, must have been a great general in his own right. What was the state of Russia in the 13th century compared to the rest of Europe and the Middle East? 

Fast-forwarding to the 15th century, how was Ivan the III (Ivan the Great) able to secure power, defeat the Golden Horde, end Mongol domination of Russia and assume the title Tsar? 

Furthermore, what role did the Byzantine Empire play exactly since Russia adopted Eastern Orthodox Christianity over other religions? 

According to this Harvard research: https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1997-811-25-Poe.pdf

Russians saw Moscow as the "Third Rome" and this idea was bought forth via Filofei in the 1500's.

Upon Ivan the III's death in 1505, how would the Tsardom of Russia (1533) impact Europe   Asia? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Mughal1700.png

Mughal Empire ruled over the Indian subcontinent for 300 years and had claim to a lot of impressive stats, such as: ruling almost 25% of the world's population at that point in time, ruling over 3.2 million square kilometres of land, and sources claim had a GDP of $90 billion in the 16th century.

According to Colombia university: http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part2_17.html

Lahore is cited as being equal to London in trade, commerce, wealth, etc. in the 16th century. It's stated in the research that the Mughal Empire was very, very wealthy thanks to "indigo, saltpeter, spices, opium, sugar, woolen and silk cloth of various kinds, yarn, asafoetida, salt, beads, borax, turmeric, lac, sealing wax, and drugs of various kinds."

More quotes from the research:

"Apart from silk and cotton textiles, other industries were shawl and carpet weaving, woolen goods, pottery, leather goods, and articles made of wood."

"The manufacture of cotton goods had assumed such extensive proportions that in addition to satisfying her own needs, India sent cloth to almost half the world: the east coast of Africa, Arabia, Egypt, Southeast Asia, as well as Europe." </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's no secret that Germany lost World War I and World War II. Now I'm aware World War I started in 1914 but if we go by the end date of 1918 then it has been less than 100 years.

Germany is still relatively young only created in 1871. Since 1871 they've been a global economic powerhouse and after suffering unfair treaties, destruction, death, displacement, and overall detriment to their economy in the last 100 years, today, Germany still somehow stands as one of the world's top 3 economies. As an Economics major, this is fascinating to me. 

On a related note, the USSR was on the "winning" side of World War II and therefore had treaties which benefited them. Yet somehow the USSR still collapsed economically while Germany kept growing exponentially. An analysis of Germany vs. USSR economies post-World War II and throughout the 19th century in general would be appreciated. Personally, 


Here's an interesting graph I found: http://eng.globalaffairs.ru/photo/active/72.jpg

Per capita, the USSR's GDP was impressive. Moreso than modern Russia. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rome is referred to as the 'Eternal City' and was capital of the world for almost a millennia. Rome was the centre of trade, politics, culture, engineering, science, and everything in between.

Milan was conquered by Rome in 222 BC - much later after Rome was already well established as a premier city.  

Milan then saw numerous rulers after the fall of the Western Roman Empire with the House of Visconti, Sforza, Habsburgs, etc.

Today, the city of the Milan and the Lombardy region accounts for 1/6 of Italy's population (10 million) yet accounts for 1/5 of Italy's GDP. Milan is Europe's 3rd biggest economy after London and Paris producing 133 billion per year.

Both cities share so many similarities. Rome was founded in 750 BC and Istanbul was founded in 660 BC. Rome grew as a centre for trade due to its central location in the Mediterranean and Istanbul grew as a centre for trade due to its central location between Europe and Asia. Both cities were capital of the Roman Empire and later Rome would be the capital of the Western Roman Empire while Istanbul would be capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. Of course, I am aware Istanbul was called Constantinople for much of history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The United States is 240 years old and in comparison to some nation states, that is quite a long time. The Holy Roman Empire endured as an empire for over 840 years, 844 years to be exact (962-1806), which is unfathomable and ruled over such a large portion of the European continent. 

The House of Habsburg was arguably the most powerful family in Europe as well with Maria Theresa's sons, Leopold II and Joseph II both ruling the Holy Roman Empire in the 18th century and early 19th century and their father Francis I before that. It seems from a political point of view, one of the strongest states ever created.

This should do great things for the scene especially amongst those pro players that have retired of have considered retiring. I think if we see prize pools this size of course more players will flock back to Starcraft II. With Brood War HD coming out amongst other factors, this is what Starcraft II needs. What does r/starcraft think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know there's a general consensus on who the "top 5" Brood War players are and I'd love to hear everybody's opinion. However, I want to mention a special player that r/starcraft never mentions: Grrrr...


Grrrr..., a Protoss from Canada, remains the only foreigner to ever win an OSL (2000) beating Korean legends like HOTForever. He also came 3rd in the 2001 OSL. 

As a Canadian, Grrrr... is an inspiration.  </TEXT>

One of the largest empires in history stretching from Spain to India. It would be epic in scope and the time period would provide for unique units, agents, traits, everything. Seems like a Total War idea that would make a lot of money.

With all refurbished products, I was expecting something in not-so-great quality however, Nintendo really impressed me. 

The 2DS I purchased came in a box complete with the manuals, SD card, AR cards, charger, stylus, and Mario Kart 7 download. The 2DS console itself is literally in 10/10 condition. Thank you, Nintendo. I strongly urge you guys to purchase from the Nintendo store because their products are quality. I can't even tell that this has been used before. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Of these two pseudo-legendaries from the last two gens, who do you favor more? 

I noticed Game Freak have started to focus more on special-based pseudo-legendaries as Hydreigon has 125 Sp. Attack and Goodra has 150 Sp. Defense. This is compared to Dragonite, Tyranitar, Salamence, Garchomp, etc. who are more physical-based.

According to Smogon, both Goodra and Hydreigon are utilized in the OU tier. To those that do Wi-Fi battling, which one do you encounter more?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Discussion: Who is the greatest sweeper Pokemon of all-time? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-08 19:24:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been into competitive battling since the 4th gen (Diamond/Pearl) mostly due to the DS actually being Wi-Fi compatible. I used to do my fair share of Wi-Fi battling and follow Smogon religiously. I know there exists a ton of sweeper Pokemon that anyone could argue could be #1. 

Personally, I'd go with Salamence. I remember when Salamence was deemed too powerful for OU and was re-classed as Uber. I've seen so many Wi-Fi battles where Salamence sets up a few Dragon Dance and proceeds to sweep the entire team. Salamence may be outclassed by Rayquaza but it has the checkmate ability in Intimidate. 

Just as a little side note, I've always loved that Salamence learns Fly by level up unlike Dragonite, Hydreigon, etc. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Favorite rivalries of all-time in Starcraft 2? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-02 22:04:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've followed Starcraft II for quite a while, since Wings of Liberty era, however, my favorite rivalry is probably from 2014.

2014 was the era of Zest vs. soO in GSL - one of the best rivalries ever. I'm a Terran player however this was a Protoss vs. Zerg that I'd rank over everything. Zest and soO are arguably two of the most talented players to ever come out of Korea. Both of them can regularly hit 500 APM which is impressive as fuck. They met each other in 2014 GSL Season 1 finals, 2014 GSL Season 3 semi-finals, and 2014 GSL Global Championship. Regardless of your race, you need to check out this rivalry in GSL.

<DATE> 2015-09-29 22:52:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For a nation of 10 million people, Portuguese clubs always seem to do extremely well in the Champions League in relation to their population. Just last season Porto was in the quarter-finals and of course Porto won the CL in 2003-2004. Benfica was in the quarter-finals in 2011-2012, too.

On the other hand, countries like the Netherlands, Belgium, Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, etc. all have a higher population than Portugal yet their clubs are not as successful in the Champions League...at least nowadays. Primeira Liga is constantly a threat to Ligue 1 in the coefficient. What's the secret? </TEXT>
