<TEXT> well that is the idea...to stop everything including MK:
I guess my questions was : how long will you guys guess it will take to the body to get back to normal...
considering was:
- 6 weeks Lgd at 5 mg
- 4 weeks torem at (30/30/15/15)
- 4 months MK677 at 12.5 mg

<TITLE> Trying to get a clean/clear TRT Blood Test, after LGD/Torem + MK677 cycle. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-19 01:06:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Finished an LGD cycle with Torem for PCT (last day March 7th) 
Been running MK677 on the background for the last 4 months...and still on it.
i have scheduled a blood work with a TRT clinic on April 3rd and i want to get a clear / true results as possible.

Can you guys help me guesstimate the following questions?

- How many days before blood test should i stop MK677 to get a true reading? 

- Blood test scheduled for 1 month after last Torem dosage, do you guys think is enough time to get a true reading?

thanks!

EDIT: The final question being: if i stopped everything today, how long will it take to the body to go back to normal levels so i can get proper readings and plan accordingly with better knowledge. 
(I realize i should have done this before anything else to get a baseline, i wanted to test the waters and see how my body reacted to the compounds )
i am trying to get things proper now, so your knowledge and/or advice is appreciated.
Thanks!
