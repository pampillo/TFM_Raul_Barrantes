<TEXT> From my knowledge the burning at the bottom of the pan is due to having too little liquid. Tho it could be that the Garlic burnt and made a sour taste too, But this is unlikely since you said the pork was resting on it. In my opinion you should have added water with the white wine so you would have a decent amount of liquid at the bottom of the pan, if you have too much liquid at the end you could always reduce it to intensify the flavor to your liking.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sounds Great! The only difference is that I cooked the Salmon skin side down until 3/4 done, This gives the skin more time to crisp up. It's also very important to have medium heat because if its's too hot the skin will scorch and not caramelize. 

Instead of butter I used olive oil and seasoned with salt and Dill.

In your method of cooking, does the skin turn out extremely crispy ? Because I am thinking that it will remain slightly soft and that is not pleasant to eat in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not exactly sure which type of salmon it was, The fish monger did not specify. But I am sure that you can do this with Norwegian Salmon as the restaurant I work in has Norwegian Salmon and that is how we serve it.

<TEXT> Cooked the Salmon skin side down until 3/4 ready on medium heat (Important that the pan is not too hot when you place the salmon). Brushed the salmon with olive oil before cooking and added some more to the pan. Don't know about the timing, but its easy to tell when salmon is 3/4 cooked because you can tell by the colour change. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Trust me their was no need for any Gorgonzola on top (although it sounds interesting), the flavor profile was already amazing as is, trust me. 

I chose to just put parsley on top to cut through the richness of the sauce at times. The lemon zest i think would have been a good idea, but the garlic i would leave out, only because i used the garlic that i braised the beef ribs in with the sauce and the filling. 

Truely appreciated that you noticed that a lot of time and effort  was taken to produce this dish. Thank you so much for the ideas and compliments ! 

P.S I did add much more sauce, that amount was just for presentation :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really don't agree with the above point you have made. Muscle does have exceptional flavour. One of the most expensive cuts of beef for example is the filet Mignon, which is a very lean meat and has superb taste.

I totally agree that fat enhances the flavor and makes a big part of it. but it's wrong to think that muscle has no flavor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for the information !! The main reason I post my pictures here is to get feedback from people and improve and try new things.

Would you be kind enough to give me a recipe or a link to find the authentic chicken satay you are mentioning ?  I would mainly like to see what ingredients the sauce and marinade contain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I Find it difficult to believe that you found a marbled chicken breast, I have never heard of such a thing. Plus the chicken breast is an extremely lean part of the chicken.
 
In any other type of meat (Pork, Veal, Lamb, Game animals) it would be great to find a marbled piece of meat as this keeps the piece of meat juicier once cooked.

Marbling is just intramuscular fat (fat deposited into the muscle's) which when cooked it melts making the meat tastier and juicier.

Hope this helps ! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I preferred not to cook the chicken on skewers because since the chicken is cut into smaller pieces it dries out quicker once cooked. A whole boneless drumstick retains more juices.

I did marinade it for at least an hour in the below ingredients.

4 tablespoons coconut milk (from a 400ml tin)
1 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar
1 tablespoon Thai red curry paste
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon fish sauce
Pinch of salt
4 skinless chicken thighs, bone-in </TEXT>

Make pesto (Garlic,basil,Chilli, Parmesan,olive oil, pine nuts)

The meat looks so red just because of the lighting and angle of the camera, plus i had let the patty rest which distributed the juices through the whole patty giving it more of a reddish colour </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do agreed with you to a certain point, But I hot smoked it (their are 2 types of smoking, hot smoking and cold smoking)

With hot smoking the cheese will not take a tremendous amount of smoke since it will smoke for no longer than 45 minutes to 1 hour, which would leave the Brie melted with a nice layer of smoke at the top. </TEXT>
