<TEXT> I can see them trying if they get desperate.

But with what's already known, Flynn carrying the bag for this would raise too many questions about who knew what and when.  Do they burn Sessions as well?  Pence?  Why the delay?  Why were Flynn's ring-ins kept on even after the firing?  What if he sings?

If Flynn lands in the shit for this he's going to spray it over most of the executive whether he wants to or not. </TEXT>

The reason we're here, two weeks later, with people like you sniping at her rather than, for example, our PM's rather cynical use of the day is that we do a very fine job in this country of policing who is and isn't Australian enough to speak for us all.

"Had Dutton properly understood the consequence" seems a phrase we could oft repeat in this whole saga.

Important ruling because of the Federal Court's recognition of non-refoulement requirements in relation to Section 501.  Will be interesting to see whether the government braves an appeal or moving it to the High Court. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And yet that arrangement had worked amicably for 15 years. The owner certainly took on a risk but there's a clear reduction in utility here, both for the owner and his customers.

I would say that it should have been fairly obvious that the new scheme reduces the ability for welfare recipients to plan necessary but non-urgent spending and thus severely limits the degree of even trivial debt that can be taken on safely.  That however is a statement far better directed at those who designed the scheme than any shop owner. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People have a right to seek asylum via any means save violence and we have a basic legal obligation and have made explicit international undertakings to uphold those rights.  We flout both.

Mixed migration is however very adept at operating on paths of least resistance.  We had an effective, if what would now be considered very, very dated system in place during the Indochina refugee crisis that managed to both shorten the journeys of asylum seekers and mostly defused the domestic political concerns.  A return to a modernised, regionally cooperative system would likely be the best outcome for all sides of this debate and it's something the Greens have been running as part of their policy platform for some time.  Unfortunately, we've done much to hamper those relationships in recent years.  It's not something that could be put in place quickly and we've actively exacerbated that timeline. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And unfortunately this is nothing new, though it's become more blantant in recent years, and nor is it a particularly unreasonable comment.

There's been significant issues with investigative bias since the late 90s that started to be put in stark relief under Mick Keelty's tenure and the events of 2001.

Where it really accelerated though IMO was with the remerger of the APS for anti-terrorism purposes, which was ultimately done despite the Stewart Royal Commission's initial reasoning.  In that light, it's hardly surprising that we're where we are.

The AFP needs inquiry and remaking on a scale I fear neither party is willing to entertain. </TEXT>

This is a committee under ECOSOC and is thus under the General Assembly's structure.  It can discuss and make statements only.  If anything, a smart operator would use Saudi Arabia's presence on the group as a mechanism to highlight issues in the country over the course of this session's sittings.

Actual implementation of rights programs, monitoring and enforcement are roles of bodies under the Secretariat, an entirely separate division of the UN System.

The UN System is complex and you'll get similar sounding groups under the different wings but it's worth looking at precisely what is being talked about.  It's that confusion, and the associated conflation of statehood with citizenship, that is used to push agendas. </TEXT>

When it comes to actually living though, you've got security and strong legal backing as a tenant and it's a model from which we'd do well to adopt large portions. </TEXT>

On the premise of the lede I agree entirely but, in an Australia struggling to reconcile personal politics and prejudice with the structural realities of an Australian identity, I hold little hope of an open reassessment of the racial aspects of founding myth.

<TEXT> I'm honestly not sure.

My two theories are that outright reneging on this would paint our government into such a spectacularly awkward corner with their own pet xenophobes that Trump might actually lose a potentially supportive voice because of it.  On top of that, Trump's new "extreme vetting" policy and its requirement for country of origin involvement is quite literally impossible to ethically or legally comply with for agencies managing refugees and practically impossible for the refugees themselves.  It offers a very, very easy out and one that I doubt Bannon or Sessions have missed. </TEXT>

Pence told a joint news conference with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Sydney that the deal would be subject to vetting, and that honoring it "doesn't mean that we admire the agreement".

<TEXT> So far removed from any and all reporting on the matter thus far that this looks to be a complete fabrication.

A statement from the PNG Defence Force alleged that an officer was assaulted by an asylum seeker, "which led to an escalation of the confrontation".

"Rocks were allegedly thrown by the asylum seekers and shots fired by the members of the Naval base," it read.

"Few people [were] treated for minor injuries."

A statement from PNG Police alleged that the soldiers involved were drunk.

**Neither statement referenced a child.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Usually it's rehabilitation and parsimony requirements though things like mental impairment etc. can also factor in.

As an example, an offender with a serious medical condition that could not be managed appropriately in a prison may preclude a custodial sentence despite circumstances where that would be expected.  A judge has the right to deprive someone of their liberty in the course of serving justice, but not to deprive someone of their health.

This can get particularly involved with youth sentencing where expectations of undisturbed education, training, parental access, the family relationship and other formal and informal rights of the child all factor into the decision. </TEXT>

The law at the time was extremely clear, Gichuhi lost her Kenyan citizenship by voluntarily acquiring another one.  This is the agreed position of the Kenyan representatives of state.

If changes in legal apparatus in foreign countries can disqualify an Australian citizen from office after the fact that's simply unacceptable in a nation of immigrants.

*If* this gets up, and I remain skeptical of that, then Frydenberg, Danby and Dreyfus need to have their eligibility challenged just to establish the scope of the legal problem. </TEXT>

Navy have shot more than 100 times, some of them have broken into rooms. The situation on #Manus is critical

Everything we're hearing appears to be coming out of the Mike and Foxtrot compounds at the far side of the camp from the Navy Compound.  No news yet out of Delta, Oscar the (now former) IHMS or ops offices, all of which are closer.

Edit:  This sounds encouraging

https://twitter.com/BehrouzBoochani/status/852867516984508416

Police in control now, driving around the centre to protect refugees. Navy has left. Australian officers will return soon. Sounds positive

Looks like those whose duty it is to protect these asylum seekers and refugees will be returning from their hiding spot shortly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was sitting at the table.  We had finished dinner.  We're now having dessert.  And we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen and President Xi was enjoying it.

And I was given the message from the generals that the ships are locked and loaded, what do you do?

And we made a determination to do it, so the missiles were on the way.  And I said, Mr. President, let me explain something to you.  This was during dessert.

We've just fired 59 missiles, all of which hit, by the way, unbelievable, from, you know, hundreds of miles away, all of which hit, amazing. </TEXT>

Kayfabe has also evolved to become a code word of sorts for maintaining this "reality" within the direct or indirect presence of the general public. </TEXT>

I suspect, and hope, that's as far as it will go for the time being.  The current US administration hasn't got the capabilities for a war with much anyone presently, let alone one with a Russian backed opposing force.

<TEXT> If she became an Australian citizen in 2001 I believe this should be a non-issue for her.

http://kenya.asn.au/?page_id=13515

Any person who voluntarily applied for the citizenship of another country lost his Kenyan citizenship as a matter of law.

Under the new laws she'd be entitled to regain it but I'm fairly sure it was automatically lost back in 2001 when she acquired her new citizenship.

One thing I am curious of now, I've seen several people suggest that even if there was an outstanding issue she would have the opportunity to correct it prior to being sworn in.  If anyone's got the basis for that claim I'd love to see it. </TEXT>

The perennial deputy Liberal leader can forget any ambitions she may still harbour to replace Turnbull should he fall or quit.

Were they absent on coiffure training? Not kind or pretty but a taste of the exasperation consuming MPs. It is not only the opposition that is lampooning Bishop for fashion diplomacy.

As a federal prosecutor in Richmond, Comey started Project Exile, which federalized local gun cases and delivered harsh sentences to those convicted of weapons charges. Comeys prime backer in that project? The then-deputy attorney general, Eric Holder. Comey was so proud of his Richmond work that a gun confiscated in Project Exile hung in his office as general counsel at Lockheed Martin after leaving the Bush administration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The archetypical, enduring face of it in Australia would be [Jim Saleam.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Saleam)

The Australia First Party remains a going concern and Saleam's been acting as a mentor for Reclaim Australia with the splinter groups co-opting various adherents to various degrees toward their various heads.

Going back a bit you've got the big upswing of far right groups in the late 80s and very early 90s of which Romper Stomper and the various bits of literature surrounding that film go into in fairly great detail.

Before that you're back to National Action and the National Socialist Party.

If you want to go WAY back you could look at Australian nationalist and anti-semitic groups stretching from pre-WW2 right back to the last quarter or so of the 1800s.  A history of The Bulletin might be a good starting point there. </TEXT>

There's an Australian Law Reform Commission report from a couple of years ago calling on the need for a Commonwealth Harassment Act to resolve the problem.

The closest analogue law likely to be drawn upon, New Zealand's Harassment Act 1997, would set the term as a superset of the existing 18C wording, including offensive material. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, "and" would infer that all conditions must be met concurrently.

The way our courts treat part a is simply to handle the test as a single test.  Any combination may be satisfied but the court is not obligated to describe how and why a particular aspect of the circumstances of the case that meets the standard of the reasonable victim test relates to an individual word, eg. humiliate.

It's considered unnecessarily verbose, open to vexatious nitpicking of decisions and is a circumstance replicated throughout our legal system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I should add, the test under part a is singular, not compound.

The phrase "offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate" is taken as a block, not individual assessments around each word.

On top of that, there's a fairly significant threshold established under Creek v Cairns Post Pty Ltd requiring "profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights".

That said, yes I'd say that's where we disagree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances

This is the section that invokes the reasonable victim test.  Basically any complaint under 18C must satisfy that a reasonable person would be insulted or offended, that 'person' effectively being an anthropomorphism of the standard of the courts established through case law and instruction.

The frequently cited example in the context of the Racial Discrimination Act is taken from Corunna v West Australian Newspapers, a case over a derogatory cartoon over the return of the head of Yangan from the British Museum.

In that case a combination of a demeaning portrayal of a significant figure in Yangan, a demeaning and derogatory representation of another religious figure, treatment of the subject of death in a manner widely considered offensive within the relevant indigenous communities, intimate details of ancestry of individual people involving rape and a perceived diminishment of their race by consequence *and* an unsupported and stereotypical view of indigenous people taking advantage of government assistance all culminated in the reasonable victim test of the case being satisfied.  Not the impact on a specific individual but transgressing on a standard of the court.

In that instance, despite satisfying the reasonable victim test and thus "failing" under 18C it was still deemed that the cartoon was presented in good faith and thus satisfied the exclusions under 18D. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As for the RDA in it's current form, i think it is seriously wrong that you can be prosecuted for words you have said that someone has interpreted as being insulting/offensive to them based on their race.

But you can't.

The current implementation of 18C isn't about proving whether or not the complainant was insulted or offended.  It's covered by a reasonable victim test.

Disturbingly it appears Brandis intends to make good on gutting that provision along the lines of the Abbott era drafts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have a suite of federal antidiscrimination legislation consisting mainly of the Australian Human Rights Act, the Age Discrimination Act, the Disability Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Racial Discrimination Act.

As for the existence of Section 18C specifically, it's the federal instrument implementing our obligations under Article 20.2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which states:

Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.

Our implementation already offers far greater discretion and the exclusions of 18D that a strict implementation of the ICCPR wouldn't permit.  We also fall short in that the religious aspect of the ICCPR right is only federally protected for ethnoreligious groups. </TEXT>

As to why this has been labelled a right wing issue, I would suggest it's because largely only a very vocal subset of Australia's right, and particularly far right, discourse that feels in any way constrained by the law.  The why of that would unfortunately appear to be the obvious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The metagame is more interesting than the content.

It shows that Trump's nothing like as rich as he claims he is, or if he *is* then he's made an insane amount of money in the decade since that needs explaining.

The White House attempt to pre-empt also shows that previous excuses for not releasing his returns are complete bullshit.

It's not a noose, but it's more rope. </TEXT>

There's much in the dossier which, if proven, would bring down the president.  Most of it however would operate on timelines of weeks to months as things were drawn out and discussed before a final impeachment.

Were that tape to drop into the media's lap on a Monday morning however, they'd be talking about Trump's resignation on Tuesday morning.  It would turn the man into a global laughing stock. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of what they call 'inequality' is just making different choices. If i stopped going to work for a year, i wouldn't expect to have a similarly prestigious position.

The thing is we *want* people to feel free to make that choice, male and female, both in terms of short term earnings and long term career objectives.

The economic and social consequences of people choosing otherwise come at very significant costs.

At present we're a long way from that point for either gender and women are disproportionately impacted due to both social biases on a woman's role in childrearing and the raw biology of the whole process.

It needs addressing from a utilitarian standpoint, let alone any other. </TEXT>

Whilst this is absolutely true for certain industries, it doesn't come close to holding for society as a whole.

Until such time as work, education, social events etc. are all available on a flexible and *freely alignable* 5 of 7 day schedule working weekends will always come at a cost to the worker (financial and/or social) compared to someone performing the same job Monday through Friday.

The expression coming directly in Article 31(1), covers the situation of a person who enters the country in which asylum is sought directly from the country of origin, or from another country where his protection, safety and security could not be assured. **It is understood that this term also covers a person who transits an intermediate country for a short period of time without having applied for, or received, asylum there. No strict time limit can be applied to the concept coming directly and each case must be judged on its merits.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> What exactly does this entail? What protections are you referring to?

We have no legal structure for handling asylum seeker and refugee hosting and because of the state of the existing adversarial system they've become almost unthinkable to establish.

Temporary protections are used with regularity globally.  Here, TPVs are actively deployed as a *punitive* measure.  And accurately so described given the mental health issues and suicides to which they've led.

That should never be the case.

If the influx is so huge then soon it will be much more expensive than offshore and then we still don't have a humane answer to processing boats that come after our services simply can't handle anymore.

Were any influx to actually get unmanageable we have a global network of resources to fall back on in the UNHCR.  We've also got numerous options to mitigate and distribute movements through regional cooperation though we've damaged that ability of late through our own actions.

Rudd had in his PNG agreement a means to kickstart proper regional processing again and Howard was actively pursuing it through the Bali Process.  Regardless of recent damage, with the kind of money we're so obviously happy to outlay it would not be hard to bootstrap actual regional protections again in collaboration with the UNHCR and, eventually, our neighbours assuming a domestic leadership style more congenial than Abbott's. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The alternative is a return to the kind of regional network that existed prior to the early 90s and our system stripped of its adversarial bullshit so as to allow actual protections for those not permanently resettled here.  Both part of the Greens platform as well as objectives of formal groups within Labor and informal ones within the Liberals.

Would we need to beef up services and fund overseas programs?  Absolutely.  But we've shown ourselves more than willing to throw huge sums of money at this issue and there's far more efficient ways of using it to assist than we have found in using it to abuse. </TEXT>

Both major parties had, and continue to have, groups within them fervently opposed to these policies *and* we have parties and independents who are absolutely opposed.

Neither the public as a group nor the voter as an individual gets to excuse their involvement here.  If you're keeping quiet, if you're voting for policy platforms that support this, if you're failing to involve yourself in shaping those platforms *you are responsible for what is done in your name.*

But there's nothing to stop public involvement, and nothing to stop public involvement ending these policies in quite short order.  That they continue is representative of the calibre of the electorate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is also a *really* good point.

The answer is we started with a legal framework that was geared to handle permanent resettlement only and then proceeded to turn it into an adversarial shit fight.

Proper refugee hosting provisions in Australian law are 30 years overdue but we need to defuse the hostile environment the last 20 years of politicking have created before it would function properly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is that the next sentence is simultaneously necessary and fantasy.

Australia must do what is necessary to assist Indonesia and the UNHCR to ensure that the necessary protection is provided in Indonesia while refugee claims are processed. 

We've abandoned the Bali Process as far as humanitarian engagement is concerned and we're still working through the damage done to our relationship with Indonesia and the tensions we created on this issue with our encroachments.

Without those protections in place turn backs are both a breach of asylum seeker's human rights and absolutely asinine if your objective is to improve safety.  Mixed migration pathways operate on the path of least resistance as it is.  Block one last mile and, as we've already seen had anyone bothered to look north, you open up another, more dangerous option.

If we intend to engage with the region we absolutely should.  We should have been doing so since the early 1990s.

At this point however, *we* need to be getting out ahead of the political problems and putting in place contact points in collaboration with the UNHCR and our neighbours.  We could start today in PNG and work from there and there's clearly no issue funding it given the billions we've spent without a peep from the electorate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Partially correct.

I'm concerned how services like disability access etc. will persist in the long run and suspect they're going to need significant propping up.

We've relied on taxis as part of our public transport infrastructure, or at least as a safety net for it, without ever properly bringing them into the PT sphere.  With the advent of unregulated taxi services like Uber and the move to deregulate as a counter to them that fall back is likely to evaporate. </TEXT>

Article 4 provides for visitation to "any place under its jurisdiction and control where persons are or may be deprived of their liberty, either by virtue of an order given by a public authority or at its instigation or with its consent or acquiescence".

The government will argue against on jurisdiction but it's not entirely clear cut, particularly when the purpose of offshore detention in the first place was to exclude it from local judicial oversight.  Manus probably has a better chance of avoiding scrutiny than Nauru as well because of the partially merged legal structures.

As for the government willingly extending coverage to those camps?  Not a chance in hell. </TEXT>

Most, if not all, of those refugees are going to fail the US's new vetting protocol as it requires input from the country of origin which is unlikely to be forthcoming and illegal to seek under our and the UN's protection requirements. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The nuance you're possibly missing is bipartisan support from our two major parties.

We're about a generation deep at this point into our conservative party (confusingly called The Liberals) making a political point out of asylum seekers to quite some success when it comes to extracting votes from a significant, xenophobic portion of the electorate.

In recent years our centrist party (Labor) have hopped on board on supporting the policies as well.

If you really want to dig into it, following the ramp down in the late 80s and very early 90s of a regional processing framework for asylum seekers flowing out of Vietnam we, as a region, unfortunately did not have the foresight to modernise it instead of shutting it down entirely.

The result is we're one of very, very few in SE Asia with any legal framework around offering protections to asylum seekers.  Offshore processing was established as away of removing these people from the protection of these laws, the oversight of our courts and, as the system has gone from bad to worse, the scrutiny of the press. </TEXT>

It is worth pushing back.  Both for the sake of the people they're targeting (if you're lucky enough that's not you personally) and for the sake of the state of the society more broadly.

Far right nationalism has a long, *long* history in this country and it's bubbled away under the surface since colonial days.  Every now and then it spills over and every now and again we beat it back into the dirt.

We can and will do it again and you only need to look at the successes of the broadly tolerant, multicultural Australia we've grown this country into to see why the fight's worth fighting, as exasperating as it can be dealing with this sort of ignorance and hatred. </TEXT>

On more substantive subjects, there is a growing pool of documentation that has been touted for release and then quietly buried, or openly so in the case of Assange's comments during the recent US election.

Add dubious business relationships, increasingly erratic commentary and now repeated attacks on other organisations releasing information such as the ICIJ and you rapidly wound the credibility of an organisation that porports itself to be an arbiter of the truth whilst being so opaque. </TEXT>

* Go through the documents together, identify high profile names agree on time tables for a mass release from their own outlets.  Have it all written up and ready to be published with the push of a button.

* Send it to Wikileaks and watch those names like hawks for a few weeks and see how much the content of the leaks is acted on.

Victoria's IBAC is ultimately pretty toothless.  NSW's ICAC may have overreached to an extent though I'd argue it's biggest problem was that it aimed at things other than what the NSW government expected.

All that said though, this has been a "must do" for well over a year now, a "should do" for arguably a decade or more and it's *clearly* got massive support in the electorate.  If the Labor Party *and* the Liberal Party don't have policies ready to go on this they're frankly negligent. </TEXT>

You'd need a real factional outsider to pull the trigger on this, that or a party facing complete electoral oblivion.  Anything meaningful is going to result in a bipartisan bloodbath by the looks of it.

Don't forget Russia has objectives in the near term as well, in particular the French and German elections via Front National and AfD respectively.

Furthermore, dividing US institutions and electorate from the President would have impacts measured in years even if Trump was Article 25d on day one.

As people may or may not know, you can connect most USB keyboards to an iPad or iPhone via the USB Camera Kit Apple sells.  What I'm wondering is whether you can cut the middle man out and build a cable that runs directly from mini USB to Lightning and have it work.

The Commission does not currently have the power to make decisions as to the standards of the case and what does and does not go before the courts.  In fact, the AHRC under Triggs has been seeking the power to make such decisions for several years now with no action from Government to so empower the Commission.

The AHRC does not bring cases.  Nor does it have the power to prevent causes being brought.  Though I see Turnbull's slur on both the Commission and Triggs has had its desired effect regardless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's been depressing to watch the immigration department wain over the last 10-15 years or so from a group of people seemingly trying to do their best, often in spite of government policy, to a group of people capable of sleeping at night with blood on their hands.

The good heads and hearts seem to have all long since left.

The amount of royalty paid is reduced by producers being permitted to claim significant deductions in areas such as operating costs and the depreciation of capital assets. There has been limited scrutiny of the claimed deductions. Some errors in the claiming of deductions have been identified, but the available evidence indicates that the problems are much greater than has yet been quantified. </TEXT>

Syria's a mess I agree and one with few good solutions.  On the one hand a tough approach risks escalating the situation.  On the other hand the US pulling back gives Assad free reign to conduct a genocide and I *fully* expect that to occur at this point.

As for the European situation, the Russian objective is to shatter the EU and the concept of a united Europe more broadly.  It will continue regardless of Trumps victory and the Kremlin backing over there is right out in the open now when it comes to groups like AfD.

You don't de-escalate the European far-east situation by destroying NATO.  You just concede ground. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm thinking international but likely not on the scale of the TPP and NAFTA.  More just exclusions from excises etc..  A special economic zone type model.

I'm working on the assumption here that President Trump on trade and immigration reflects Candidate Trump, I don't entirely have faith in that assumption at this point.  If he does though, things like the the major US start-up reactors, much of the tech industry and *particularly* small tech manufacturers do not exist in a Trumpian economy.

If they can pull it off, it should go quite nicely for the blue states.  I wouldn't say the same for the union though.  It would turn existing socioeconomic divides into gaping chasms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Blue States' Rights.

As bulwark, not dogwhistle.

Take the progressive issues the electorate have made pretty clear *don't* matter to much of Middle America and consolidate and protect them at a state level wherever possible.

I can see this stretching to trade and *possibly* even making inroads into the immigration debate.  There'll certainly be a huge push from some industries for the latter.

It would be a foil against a conservative SCOTUS that you'll likely be stuck with for a decade or three.  It would be a way of limiting the damage to, if unfortunately not protecting outright, the information and service heavy economies of CA, NY, MA etc.  And it would be a way of attracting the young and the educated from across the nation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It'll be their own observations that will sway it if it happens.

When the economy gets worse, when cost of living rises, when the jobs don't materialise but the insert epithet they hate is still there and still has their's.

If the blue states turn inward to protect their own rights and economies and let the red states dangle in the wind that will amplify it even more.  And if I were a progressive or moderate in the US facing a generation long blockade in the SCOTUS and the trade and foreign policies of a Trump presidency, I'd be scrambling to reclaim states' rights from the dogwhistlers and using it as a bulwark against a regressive federal regime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Been using it in anger since about beta 3.  Found it mostly fantastic since the proper releases.

The automatic purging of local copies has been fairly unintrusive and if you need to grab a whole folder you can.

Git, Eclipse, XCode projects and other things involving folders of files seem to work fine though if you're really banging into the limits of your local disk you may find yourself in Finder pulling full copies manually at times.

Main gripes:

* Performance in some places *sucks* and definitely fluctuates quite noticeably between country and provider.  Never had a major issue in the EU or US but at home in Australia it can be bad at times on some ISPs.  Think ~100kB/s max download speeds on much, much faster lines.

* You'll find some older/legacy applications that shove things in Documents by unconfigurable default can sometimes have issues, particularly if it's config related.  Check if there's anything you rely on that still does this and politely poke their developers to stop.

* Something keeps creating $RECYCLE.BIN folders on my Desktop and in the root of Documents.  I thought it was Parallels but I'm now not convinced.  Only an annoyance but an annoyance none the less.

* My biggest problem, iOS just can not deal with big libraries properly at the moment.  It can take most of a day for the iCloud Drive app to reflect a large initial sync (mine was nearly 100GB) and the Add to iCloud Drive share panel's exploded tree view is a joke that will timeout or crash before you can add to the top level folder, let alone expect to find anything within it.  Completely unusable.  I've sent feedback to Apple about this many times during beta and release, never had a satisfactory response and it's as broken as ever. </TEXT>

It's only going to widen existing divides, particularly socioeconomic, and if Trump's seen to betray his base he may have problems beyond the polling booth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The policy platform is a complete unknown.

Much of what was promised is either pie in the sky fantasy or implementable magical thinking that the GOP will probably recognise as extraordinarily damaging.

Much of what's needed to actually operate the country is completely unbroached.

And all this to a backdrop that could easily be getting into Civil Rights Movement levels of turmoil in fairly short order during the term. </TEXT>
