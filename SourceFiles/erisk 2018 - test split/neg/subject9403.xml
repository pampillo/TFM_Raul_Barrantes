<TITLE> Should I read WoK? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 04:29:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I read Elantris and Misborn and really enjoyed them. But I never read past book one of the MB trilogy, because book 2 just didnt capture me like the first had. It felt a little too YA for my tastes.  
  
Knowing that, would I like WoK? I enjoy huge fantasy epics like Malazan, but didn't know how WoK compares. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love HPL. I think you're right in that the best horror is what lurks in the readers own imagination so sometimes saying less does more.  
  
A good example of him avoiding this trope is the ending of Dunwitch Horror, where what he does describe is spine chilling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some books make you wonder if you should give up, and some reward those who stick with it.  
  
For me that book was Gardens of the Moon, the first Malazan novel. It was tough going at first but really ramped up in act 2. Now maybe one day I'll finish the series! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, it was preoccupation with a busy life, and then simply lesser forms of entertainment. I found myself wasting free time on mobile games which didn't offer a tenth of the depth and richness of novels. But games are easier somehow, than reading which takes mental engagement.  
  
Anyhow, it was Something Wicked by Bradbury that rekindled my love for reading. Ebooks help too as I listen while I drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> u/Schneedly you guys should read Something a wicked this way comes. I read it this summer and was blown away. I expected nothing more than a pulp horror fiction. I got a superbly well written coming of age story about the poignancy of growing up and the struggle of what you love along the way. Passages about friendship and fatherhood will habeas you tearing up. The creepy carnival has some awesome intense moments too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sad to see a lot of negative experienced. Homeschooling was mostly a highly positive experience for me. My parents chose to high school us because coming from a military family we moved around every couple of years and that made it difficult to really get involved in local programs or activities anyway. The education quality was great, and my parents - mother mainly - was very dedicated to making sure we were finding other outlets for socialization and using all sorts of creative plans for educational experiences like trips to national parks and historic sites.  
 It was a bit jarring going to a public high school because - as others have said - most people had grown up together since pre-school so it became hard in a small school to break in and make friends. The other jarring things was the massive drop in educational quality.  I entered 9th grade at a 12th grade reading level and was fairly advanced in most classes as well.  
I should mention I have known a ton of home school families that have turned out kids with very serious deficits in reading and educational abilities.  I think this is for a couple of reasons. Some people home school out of dedication to their child's educational success and to give them great advantages that can come with this style of schooling. Others home school out of some religious or societal obligation, with no real dedication to the value of their child's learning, and by far this latter group does great harm to their kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a homeschooler who's known several others both successful and unsuccessful, I'm sorry for your experience. I think it honestly all depends on the parent's involvement level. Homeschooling is not bad per-se, if the parents are proactive and dedicated to properly educating and socializing their children. I know a lot of homeschool basket-case wrecks because their parents did it out of some misplaced fad-following ideal rather than out of a desire to give their child a healthy experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've got a question that's been nagging me.  
A lot of popular leaders have an attack boost based on a combination of colors attacking, like set, Isis, or Ronove. Why are any of these leaders considered good when lots of leaders give an automatic attack boost to the whole team based on type or color?  
  
For example why run Nepthys over LuBu when she only boosts her own attack but he triples any devil on the team? </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Vast** I know, right?? I heard all the hype about it before I ever saw the game and it looks like something a middle schooler  doodled in his textbook! I was shocked at how plain it is. Must be great mechanics though cause nobody's buying it for the art. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always thought **GOSU** looks like a neat game mechanically, but the goblin artwork on the cards, while very well done, just kind of turns me off, and would certainly my wife who is my main gaming partner.  
  
Additionally, **La Granja** looks like a great game, but the theme of farming is not epic in scope enough for my tastes. Take the same game and make it about building a city, or a space station, or managing the trades of an entire country and I enjoy it more. I find games that are too narrow or small in scope don't inspire me as much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, I mostly play 2P games with my wife and she absolutely LOVES **Seasons** and **Castles of Burgundy**, though we own several other games. I've been trying to find a game similar to those that she'd enjoy, but Race is a huge turn off bc of the iconography. So we picked up **San Juan** but it's fairly light compared to her Top Two, and she was kinda meh on it.  
  
So I've been looking at **Roll** and thinking maybe that would be more fun for her? CoB and Seasons both have dice allocation as a major factor... Has anyone played both games to compare? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sitting in a mostly abandoned shopping mall on one of those benches outside a clothing outfitter. My brother is sitting next to me waiting for our mom to finish up shopping. I notice a weird painting on the wall across the hallway from us and after looking at it for a bit I break the silence and say, "Man, is that one ugly woman!!" Right as a woman walks past us in front of the painting. She looked furious, but I was too stunned to formulate a believable excuse. Still cringe to this day. </TEXT>

First the NYT writes about Bill Clinton in scandal for golfing at Whites Only golf club:  
http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/21/us/the-1992-campaign-democrats-clinton-says-golfing-at-all-white-club-was-mistake.html  
  
Meanwhile, Trump is fighting to include Jews and Blacks at his own golf course:

Finally, Trump was falsely accused of Mocking a disabled reporter, but the media spun the story. This article provides balance:

<TEXT> For me it was a growing distrust of the MSM agenda.  
I was #NeverTrump for up until 2 weeks ago. I used to love seeing Trump get raked over the coals in popular leftist media shows, but after a while I got suspicious that they never called out Hillary on *anything*. So I decided to look into Trump and found out he made a ton of sense, more than Crooked does, and he is not the monster media paints him as. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2 Things did it for me:  
One was when a good friend of mine was falsely accused of raping a girl in his freshman year of college. After a gruellingly long process, he was finally deemed innocent of all wrongdoing, but he still lost all his scholarships, was expelled from school, and had his name smeared all over town to the point that he went into deep depression and social anxiety for years.  
  
Second was when a church in my hometown fired a pastor for having an affair with a member of the worship team. He voluntarily came clean and confessed to his family and the church, and lost his job, friendships, and any chance of a future position. The female involved? Her identity was kept secret from the congregation, she was absolved of all wrong-doing, and allowed to continue leading music. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a few questions...  It seems I joined at a good time in the middle of a bunch of carnivals and godfests and the daily Tam dungeon...  Do events like this happen alot?   
  
Also,  tried my first descend last night at level 52 and could barely get past the first 2 stages,  hardly dented the monsters.  What level should I be for those?   
  
Also,  is this community a Catch Em All kind, or is Pad not about that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was in college with a couple of friends who'd gotten back from Spring break in Flordia. One girl holds a seashell up to her ear and says, "It's the sound of the ocean!" I hold up my empty soda glass to my ear and say, "It's the sound of a refill!"  
  
Whenever I see someone get upset over something trivial or a minor mistake, like spilling coffee or something, I'll help them get over it by saying, "Well, if _________ is the worst thing that happens to you today, you could still have an awesome day!"  
  
I had a friend in high school who joked around with me a lot. One day he was really upset over asking a girl out who turned him down. I said to him, "Don't worry, it's not the end of the world..." and after a beat of silence I added, "Just yours." </TEXT>

A fun coop option that seems to fit your requirement would be **Forbidden Desert**, a game that goes 2-5 and is good at any player count, plays in 45-60 mins and has a lot of luck. It's a blast. </TEXT>

I watched for over a minute before I realize you could move the screen around.

<TEXT> I've occasionally forgotten the storage rule, but I don't think any of these rules are negative in any way. Rules by nature exist in every game to restrict certain actions while encouraging others, and I think they work very well in CoC. There is a lot to remember, yes, but I think if these restrictions didn't exist the game would be a lot less fun as the finely tuned balance would be thrown off. Just my 2 cents as a CoC fan boy though, you're free to have your own opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Biased if you see my flair, but I really like **Runebound**, and if you follow my posts, I also promote **Clash of Cultures** for this quite a bit. As for games not in my own library, I think **Descent** and **Eldritch Horror** look like they'd do this quite well. Pretty much any game that is epic in size and scope works, and it helps if it's got some Ameritrashy theming to it. Oh, and obligatory **Pandemic Legacy** mention, and any other Legacy style game. </TEXT>

And also, search online for lists of Gateway Games they are the ones easiest to get into while you learn the hobby. </TEXT>

i don't know how fair of a review i can really make of this recipe as i substituted chipotle powder (1/2 tsp) and bottled lemon juice (1/4 cup) for the recipe (that i halved).. although the spice was there, there was no pop.. i ended up squeezing the juice of one lime and shook a good amount of table salt over it.. i also added some chili powder.. i felt like it needed a lot more cilantro for that fresh taste.. since i did make substitutions i'm giving this a 3 instead of the 2 i think it's closer to

I love card combo sorts of games, but this one seemed flat. I think it was that so many of the cards across the various decks seemed identical or only slightly different, and the game feels very abstract. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Help me understand. When you say there are 6 listings for Dominion, you mean 6 copies of Dominion are being sold? Considering that's only 6 copies of a game, and 5 people selling copies of X wing, then we are looking at 11 games being sold which out of 1000+ listings is less than 1% and from that data we deduce the motive - that people want out of expansion heavy games? You could be right, but I'm not sure how these figures support that conclusion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a grand fantasy adventure, the likes of which I have not seen since Talisman. But, it fixes many of the flaws that Talisman has. There is an end-game goal, but how you choose to get there is completely up to you. But there is also a limited number of turns, which means the game won't drag on and on.
You can try to earn money to buy better equipment. Fight to gain experience and learn new skills. You can journey across the map in search of long lost treasure. There are different scenarios to play (although, only two in the base game) which create new events and encounters. Character development is rich and rewarding. You can play the same character in multiple games and have them progress differently each time. Combat is unique and refreshing with the token system. It is simple, but yet still offers plenty of strategy and doesn't feel as luck-dependent as rolling dice. quote from u/Grey-Ferret </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife recently exclaimed that **Seasons** is her absolute favorite board game - encouraging because she was very reluctant to join me in the hobby initially. You're correct in saying that the satisfaction in Seasons comes from the fact that it is a drafting game with more to it than just drafting. It is an engine building game with drafting at the center of the engine. Even after you draft cards, you spend 3 years (in game) drafting dice each turn. Some of the best artwork of any game I've ever played. The cards have insane detail, to the point that 30 games in I'll still squint at a card and realize, "Hey, that potion of resurrection, the bubbles in it are actually tiny skulls??" or something like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This. This is exactly true. I was looking recently at a used copy of a game on BGG and almost pulled the trigger on it - but when I added in shipping I was actually paying the same price as a new copy delivered in 2 days with Amazon Prime.  
If the used sale price isn't significantly lower it just makes more sense to buy games new. That's another reason trading games away has been my main way of curating a collection. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A question I have about math trades - is it a significant risk to trade **down** in value? Say I list a $20 game and a $50 game, and my want list includes a game that is $20 and another that's $45 - Might I end up trading my $50 game for the $20 game, taking a hit on trade value? Is there any protection against this? (sorry, first time math trading) </TEXT>

I have the Big Box which includes several expansions, and I must say that after playing with many of them, vanilla Alhambra is almost dull by comparison. A couple of them are pretty gimimcky (expansion 5 is meh) but 2 and 3 are amazing. My favorite expansions are the sets that include: Diamonds, Camps, Change, Exchange Cards, and Treasure Chests. I don't ever play without these. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am relatively new to anime - have watched some of the more famous ones including Steins Gate, Monster, and Death Note. I appreciate their edgy, thriller themes. But I'm trying to branch out!  
  
I've noticed a LOT of anime series tend to follow the fighting mecha trope, or the magical school students who fight monsters types, and was just wondering why these are so common? Are there other major plot styles like these? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Steins Gate. Really slow for the first 5 or 6 episodes, but then there's this halfway moment when the entire series launches into the stratosphere. </TEXT>
