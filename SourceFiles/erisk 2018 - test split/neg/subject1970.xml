<TEXT> yes it's great for people embracing each other's cultures (cultural appreciation). however, there are some people who use someone else's culture as a fashion statement and dismiss the actual meaning of that culture. but when people embrace their own culture, they are criticized for it and when others do it (especially celebs), they are praised for being "quirky/unique" 
obviously there are some things people are way too dramatic about and calling it appropriation

<TITLE> I support feminism but I'm against the "free the nipple" campaign </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-26 16:31:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am all for feminism and this campaign has a good message and everything; stop over sexualizing women's breasts (body in general)

Some so-called feminists miss the message and unfortunately only care about their topless social media photos being deleted. It just ruins it for other people who don't know the truth behind the campaign.

However, this campaign only focuses on breasts but how about the whole body? It really doesn't help with the overall message.

I don't know I probably sound insane and dumb lol </TEXT>
