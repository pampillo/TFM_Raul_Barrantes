<TEXT> Um no its not putting up results because no one plays it. No one plays it because its not putting up results. If that sounds circular, welcome to deck development when no one knows what your deck is, how it operates, and most importantly, no one wants to bother to learn.  

The idea that chalice, revoker or needle can't be beaten in and of themselves is pretty funny. There are multiple ways around all three of those cards, you need multiple pieces of permenent based disruption, and even then it depends what they are and how much of a clock you are putting on while you do that. 

Even then, breakfast can blank your creatures pretty easily if they don't have evasion. 

The removal argument is also not as powerful as you think it is. Bolt for example doesn't do anything most of the time. 2 mana removal on the draw can be kind of loose sometimes, Snapcaster into that removal is laughably bad.       

At the end of the day, when you try to update a deck with new printings that hasn't even been discussed by the more casual aspects of the community since 2015, these are the kind of comments that happen.

I would suggest you take a look at a more modern list than one from I don't even know when, and did you even look at a list before making sweeping judgements about the viability of it? Like, everything you mentioned is either
false  or exaggerated.

<TEXT> Lately I've had to invest any money I would normally spend on Sci fi  and dark fantasy novels on school textbooks and supplementary reading. The libraries in my city are garbage if you don't want young adult novels or stuff thats older than the hills. If you want to order anything, it takes 6-8 weeks to arrive.

I'm kinda at my wits end. What comprehension skills i have are almost entirely due to the volume of stuff i used to read, and everytime I would come home with a new book and a new video game I would read the book first. I almost wish I didn't read so much so that I wouldn't be so picky/discerning now.

How do you guys cost save when buying books?    </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know what? I'm gonna be controversial here. It is a much better deck.

Its faster on average, plays more disruption/ more varied disruption, plays protection in addition, plays less "dead" cards, and actually kills the opponent upon assembling the combo. also it has a plan b that actually works some amount of the time, and a sideboard plan to dodge hate.  

This isn't actually a glowing recommendation of breakfast, so much that its a harsh commendation of sneak and show. That deck is a freaking pile of crap if its worse than this in this many ways.

That being said, the reason breakfast is in my flair is because all the other decks I played/was building got splashed by the top ban, and none of them were miracles. I was tuning this in the interim while I traded/ bought the stuff for Painter, burn, and Ug post, while i was maybe thinking about giving miracles another chance. 

They banned top, hitting everything I had cards for directly or indirectly, and leaving alone this and death and taxes, and ive mentioned before on here that my local meta has very few good taxes matchups.

If D T becomes good again ill play that, when i finish getting the pieces for burn ill move to that for a while. Right now, of the available decks to me, this deck is giving me positive results so this is the one i'm playing.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have not tested it yet, but I've been thinking about it. the thing that puts me off is that every time someone else tested it circa 2-4 years ago, they concluded that shuko opens you up to losing in ways that are actually just unacceptable.

That said, and this is going to sound weird, +1/+0 equip 0 is an enormous deal. Its not even corner case, there are just a pile of situations in which having that power boost would make my opponent have to care way more about my random dorks.

The questions to be answered there are going to be:  
- How often will this be a miserable topdeck vs how often will this be a topdeck that kills them.  

-Do I have room for this card, because right now the cuts for this are Mom, shaman en-kor, SOFAI, or a daze. 

- This thing requires 2 creatures in play, illusionist and a seperate shuko target. This makes removal live in a way that it wasn't before,
and may make this card a nonstarter.

Its on my shortlist for testing though.  

Stuff that I just need an excuse to put in the board as a 1 of: Magus of the moon, leovold/notion thief, Outrider en-kor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> your list is landstill. I'm not putting standstill in landstill, I'm putting it in tezzerator to cast off of mox diamond and a land, hence the second question.

I want to try it in a vial combo deck, hence the first question.

I have no idea where either of you got landstill out of what I said outside of making incorrect assumptions about what I wanted the answer for instead of actually answering the question.

i need to know how the fish is caught here, so i know if i even want fish instead of jerky or something. Stop handing me fish. If i wanted a fish, I'd get it from the guy who discovered the fish.
Locally, that means that if i want a landstill list i would ask the guy who top 8ed jersey with landstill.         </TEXT>

<TEXT> heyy i was going to try something like this in modern!

This has been a budget option for legacy players for years. The problem has always been that black does not provide options for card selection nor effecient options to dodge or fight most hate.

If i was to play this, my sideboard would transition into full on pox. Your enemy is still disruption + clock, smallpox is good against those things, but you need to supplement a bit. Being a combo deck both ways opens you up to overlapping hate.

I'd go - leyline/helm - hymn and start by testing  + 3-4 sinkhole, + spheres + skelatal scying/ read the bones/ some monoblack x life for x cards thing.

Caveat - If you haven't played what you've drawn up, do that first before taking my suggestions.

<TEXT> True. Even so heres a rundown on some gotchas:

-Aluren is a symmetrical effect. You can also cast creatures for free!

 -Food chain is a mana ability, you cannot shut it off with needle, though you can name it just fine.

- Once you say "okay" to your opponents vial activation, its too late, the man/woman is in play and taxing you.

- for the love of god, don't use removal on infects guys on their combat if you can help it. If you can, mainphase that stuff or cast it on their end step.

- Standstill retriggers everytime a spell is cast. So yeah be careful.

- Dredge is a replacement effect, its really hard to interact with. I don't think it even uses the stack.

thats all for now, just the stuff i thought of off the top of my head. It would be cool to compile all these nuggets in one place and sort them by category, but thats... a lot of work.

<TEXT> on azami vs hapless resercher: researcher could easily be better, but azami protecting you at the end is more and more of a relevant thing. Does that outweigh azami costing 5 freaking mana? idk. Needs testing.

I made this build to ensure Mentor had support. After this, I'm never playing Mentor over true name again. Was way too unreliable as a kill card. i would play it, it would stick, and it would just beat for 2 a turn, 3 sometimes. I strongly suspect the problem with mentor in this shell is it rewards proactive spell casting, and this list has not nearly enough of that.

On stoneforge: They're going back in and they're staying there unless something weird happens. having a plan b is way too good in way too many situations, and honestly the creatures are very resillient against other creatures. Also you have a ton of incedental guys.

On the amount of mana: This is going to blow your mind, but if it wasnt for color considerations and to a lesser extent the current  sideboard plan, I'd look hard at cutting another land. Yeah. I didn't believe it either, I kept telling myself it couldnt be correct, but honestly, With a vial in play your lands are entirely irrelevant outside of casting cantrips and activating stoneforge.   Without a vial, you still only have to cast maybe 6  mana worth of spells over the course of an average game, with that number going up the longer your deck feeds you garbage. Your combo only costs you three mana. 3 for recruiter if something goes wrong with a piece, 1 for a cantrip, its not much at all.

<TEXT> round 1 vs burn loss 1-2.   
game 1 I didn't force vortex because i'm an idiot and it beat me.  
game 2 He tapped out for double rift bolt on turn 3 and just died to my combo.   
game 3 We both drew like garbage but i also played like garbage.   

round 2 vs UB reanimator win 2-1 (this one went to turns!)  
Game one: I  resolved a Vial through a pregame Chancellor reveal. He cast Careful study into Lotus petal- Reanimate on Chancellor, I had the combo in hand but had to wait a turn. He had Thoughtseize for my other half, so i just Vialed in creatures and started the race. I lost because i let him hit me one too many times with chancellor and forgot he could dome me for 2 with brutality like the idiot i am.  

game two: He went dread of night into needle, so i recruited lab man and beat down with blue 1/1s and that guy  while holding countermagic+ surgical.    

game 3 was weird, involving celephid beatdown from me and a mull into awkward 1 lander from him. I eventually counter all his reanimators on the crucial turn, followed by an attack for lethal. He had entomb  on his turn one, but i Surgicaled his grislebrand then therapied his brainstorm leaving him with a bunch of dead stuff.      

round 3 vs death/taxes win 2-0  
game 1:  

my turn 1 :fetch for tundra, vial.   
his turn 1 : cavern, mom.  
my turn 2: vial nomad, play cavern on wizard, cast illusionist, kill you.  

game 2 was bizarre, I cant give full details. the board state at the end was:  

Me: Vial on three, combo in play, recruiter in play, Labman and Disenchant in hand, tundra island untapped,    plains tapped.  

Him:  Thalia in play with a Jitte(2  counters) and a sword of war/peace equipped, three vials and no cards in hand.   he also just had a Stoneforge come in off the vial, so he could Jitte equip swing. He was tapped out, but had 4  plains 1 port. Jitte has 2 counters.

It is his end step. How did i win this game?  
We will come back to that mess.  

round 4: vs MUD loss 1-2.  

Honestly I was tired here, but here is what i remember:  

game one: We had some back and forth, my opponent had a chalice which was invalidated by vial except in two ways that only came up because I drew the one of dread return and the game one configuration of the deck couldn't cast it naturally, which if I'd realized so earlier I could have just spent 2 turns drawing up to 8 cards so I could discard it, as I had dealt with the first bit of pressure. Whatever, happens, play better/ build better.  

game 2 I disenchanted his chalice on end step, then cast the other half of my combo and killed him.  

game three: I don't remember except  that his hate was multiple torpor orb, and a chalice. i was stuck with 1 drops and recruiters in hand, and then he dropped platinum angel and beat me up with it.  

overall 2-2 in matches. I accomplished what i wanted, which was to test mentor over true-name in the board and practice playing the combo through hate.  

Shout out to the poor guy who came from the next town over to play only to find out from hearing me talk to my first round burn opponent what he thought of the banning that top got banned. If you want to test to see what you want to play, there's cheap beer and cheaper pizza across the street here and I'm buying.  

Props to  the lgs giving that guy a refund, it was the decent thing to do.    
 
The Breakfast Tax Dodge/ Solution to the above d t match puzzle:  

Go to my turn, Disenchant the Jitte on upkeep while paying for Thalia. Combo off, putting library into yard. Vial in lab man, go to draw step, win game.  

Getting to this line required some thinking ahead, as I needed to recruit for lab man the turn prior. I don't always play like garbage.    

list at  http://manadeprived.com/showdown-recap-march-5th-legacy/.  
- 2 stoneforge, 1 jitte, 1 SOFI, 2 mother of runes, 1 shaman en kor, 1 scrubland.  
+ 3 probe,  3 swords, 1 recruiter, 1 tundra.  

The sideboard changes per event. This time:  
1 swords, 3 mentor, 1 underground sea, 2 unearth, 2 disenchant, 1 daze, don't remember the rest(probably wasn't good)

<TEXT> the mana in ub is way worse though. grixis has 16-17 souces of blue mana and 14 sources of black, and whatever red sources vary (I have 11-12.)

UB has 13 blue sources and 12 black sources. good luck casting double color spells, tell me how that goes.

keep in mind, grixis usually doesn't even try, and also lowers sol land emphasis.

its possible that there is a ub build that cuts some signets/ talismans for mox diamonds, and maybe plays some future walker    that is good and doesn't stress the mana as much as jace, but casting that card in  UB is usually a pipe dream.

<TEXT> For leyline, its not the 4 cmc, its the double black. 16 black sources is not even close to enough in a wasteland format, and even the karsten methodology calls for 18 sources of black for that.

Dareeti is way better than dack with thopter sword. also dack's +1 is really the only reason you would even want it, and its just not very good. 
One of my biggest problems with dack is that on an empty board, it doesn't put any pressure on the opponent or defend you at all. Ive lost a lot of games because my opponent has just let me resolve dack and then ignored it for  3-4 turns. There is just no mode on that thing that puts you up cards without more help than  just sword can give you.

I think that if you decide to run dack, yeah go ahead and run coating. you'll need it or something similar just to make dack worth a card.

I would cut all dacks for daretti's, move all forces to the board, play another diamond, main padeem, cut a thopter foundry, and then start thinking about putting 1 ofs in your deck that your opponent can't usually afford to let resolve/stick.

The list posted has 28 sources of mana, then 6 cards that don't do anything on their own,  and then you also start 2 for 1ing yourself with force of will? Then dack is card disadvantage and jace is difficult to cast.

And then you want more blanks in leyline of the void? Uh uh. No thanks. As is your opponent is just going to let you resolve  half of whatever 2 card synergy you try to set up, then counter/ break up the other half, leaving you with dead cards.

Lastly, twenty blue cards for force is pretty deceptive here right? Most of the spells worth protecting are blue, so you have to calculate with 3 cards for force when you use it offensively, which i haven't done the math on but seems so unlikely here that it wouldn't be worth it.       </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, it seems like most people don't understand how much the mana matters here, so here goes. 

First, leyline of the void is highly unlikely to be cast, so take the suggestion to play it with a grain of salt. 

Compounding this, this deck cannot support both leyline and force, you then start to cave to hard countermagic. A single force of will backed by a clock will kill you.

On top of this, you cannot play dead cards in a deck that has 28 mana sources and low impact stuff like sword of the meek. Get liquidmetal coating out of there.

As a result of coating being gone, dack fayden is now the worst card in the deck, so cut that entirely.

Add more daretti, that card is the best in the deck not close. 

If you want to know what 75 I'm playing this weekend, ill send you a list. 

The thing you have to remember about grixis
Tezz deck construction is that half your deck doesn't do anything most times, so each card has to be worth a LOT. Otherwise your control and midrange opponents will just counter your first key spell and you cave. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tried guys, I really did. 
After playing a bunch of fighters that did not appeal to me at all, I discovered Blazbue when Calamity trigger came out.
 I followed along with the story, picking up each game for that. I picked up a ps2 copy of Guilty Gear: Accent core r  at the same time as Continuum shift,
and then tried going into the mechanics of the game when I stopped being able to beat the comp in story mode. I got most of my friends up from "button masher" to the point where they can Dragon punch, hodoken, and dash when they wanted to most of the time, even the ones who didn't play video games that often. For the ones who did, I ran them through all the basic systems involved. None of us could remember all the things all the time, but we all knew a couple of ways to at least try to get out of bad situations.

Here's the thing though: the ability to think fast enough to  solve problems presented at this speed is either the sole province of supermen or the result of way more practice than I can responsibly put in, and I am pretty certain the former is a myth.

So I am out, maybe I'll try again later, but demands on my time are getting heavier as of late. I could be convinced to get back on the horse if 2 hours of practice a week is going to cut it, but I strongly suspect it is not.

If anyone having trouble with basic execution has questions though, I did teach a bunch of complete casuals how to stop a lazy approach with Sol badguys sick "fire wall shoryouken " variant, so yeah.

Btw, taking someone from " I only play clash of clans, and sometimes Civ5" to "I just spent my previous evening curb-stomping my boyfriend with Noel vermillion"  in less than 8 hours over 3 weeks is immensely satisfying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay infect is a bust, but rw painter can find this with tutor and its creature dodges -1 -1 effects anyways.

Really though, This is a question about this card more generally than this. My question is more " does this card meet the general standard of playability for the format, and if so what kind of deck would want it" than does "this fit into existing archetypes that are also tier one."

I'm starting to feel that to get people to even care enough to talk I have to mention a "real deck" instead of the deck i actually want to talk about.

<TEXT> Okay, I think I see what you're attempting to say here.

I think my the issue I took with what you were saying stems from the fact that I thought you were making a blanket statement instead of talking about cards that are already powerful.

Even in that context, what you actually said the first time is still pretty wonky. It actually directly contradicts this 
 A card or strategy can break a format, if it's both broken and difficult to answer

the qualities are different, but one is a modifier on the other.

from my understanding you said this 
The fact that an opponent can or can't interact with a card does not determine brokenness. A card or strategy can break a format, if it's both broken and difficult to answer; but those are two different qualities.

and meant this:  
The fact that an opponent can or can't interact with a card does not determine brokenness in and of itself. A card or strategy can break a format, if it's both broken and difficult to answer; but those are two different qualities.

Saying interaction doesn't matter, than proceeding to list all the ways to interact with will to prove a point is a little weird.

I would say that once a minimum amount of power is reached, the inability to interact with an effect is an indicator of and modifier on power level regardless of even the competitive game in question. </TEXT>

<TEXT> this What your opponents can do is not relevant to a card's power level.

Is silly. of course it is.  If it wasn't hexproof wouldn't be a mechanic, and threat resiliency wouldn't be a thing. you're essentially saying the ability to interact with a spell isn't relevant to a that spells power, which is not remotely true. 

Fast mana enables nonsense. ban the fast mana, ban the nonsense, or print better answers to both.

they consistently print more nonsense and they inconsistently  print reasonable answers, but they have been banning enablers in every format for years, so it looks like opal or spirit guide get the axe.

Keep in mind they now have a buisness model of printing nonsense, so yeah.

To be clear, I don't think either spirit guide or opal should be banned, but they will mostly because current card design breaks these cards. Failure to balance cards that end up in modern is way too visible for this stuff to keep existing, and the bar for bans is getting lower all the time.

So for image reasons, opal gets the axe.

<TEXT> cool, ban spirit guide too.

Look, they pretty clearly need to ban threats, ban enablers, or print answers. They want to make better threats, ban enablers, and make answers suck most of the time.

Opal is probably getting the axe, cause Wizards has cognitive dissonance on lock when it comes to bannings. 

Also consider how many fewer large modern events there are/ will be, and what this deck does to players at the local level, especially in light of Wizards focus on removing events that would weed this thing out. Consistency matters a lot less at fnms and 5 round swiss monthlys.

Ultimately, the increased ban schedule allows them to react better to changing perceptions, so they will. If they didn't have a decreased focus on data, they would have just left the schedule as it was so they could collect more data from bannings.       </TEXT>

In modern, I'd settle for wasteland though. most modern combo decks slow down considerably or fold after getting their first land cacked, but more importantly the card forces those decks to reevaluate which hands are keepable.   </TEXT>

thinking about it though, blaming them is hard because focusing on story/setting/characters can be hit or miss. you get fifth dawn or ravnica, kamigawa or nemesis, "The Gathering Dark" or freaking " Scourge"

OTOH, "Brothers War" was character focused. Maybe the key is not treating your audience like drooling idiots and cooptiing the worst parts of comics, like retcons and multiple character origins, and reboots and crossovers that require reading 3 other titles to know wtf is happening. 

Even comics are coming to the realization that this is a problem, and are doing what they can to fix it.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> disclaimer: I typically play legacy and draft.

Hi!  I've noticed a petty big hole in my ability to play certain decks/ analyse certain gamestates, which is my inabilty to notice when to switch gameplans when the clues are subtle, and this comes up most often when I am playing a mirror match.

I've noticed it happen at two points: when sideboarding, and when both players have similar board states, and it gets so much worse the more information is hidden.

The good news is, when you choose wrong in legacy, you get punished immediately, so I get good feedback that way. I get to point to exactly what I did wrong and say " that was where I missassigned my role."   

heres an example of a board state that usually gets me killed:  

My board: 2 x plains, rishadan port, aether vial@3, flickerwisp,
thalia guardian of thraben, In hand swords to plowshares.  

Oppenent has: 2x plains, port, vial @3, serra avenger, sanctum prelate @1, One unknown card.

The play for me is clearly nothing, but what is my plan here?

example sideboarding disaster in the making: Lands mirror. what is the plan? not individual sideboard cards, but what the heck am I trying to accomplish here?  Is it a race or are we trying to go over each other? Am i trying to disrupt or to prevent disruption? note those questions are interlinked.

I'm not trying to get answers on a case by case basis, but to illustrate my core problem of missassigning my role when my role is  some combination of fluid and hand dependent, and my opponent has a similar deck/ board state.

until I get this figured out, I can't competently pilot any deck capable of switching gameplans that consists of cards which do similar things like delver variants, lands, or miracles, and even death and taxes to a lesser degree. I actually need to pilot decks with a more shoeboxed plan, which actually keeps me out of most of the tier one strategies of the format. 

Hilariously, I'm priced out of brainstorm on the strategic level. I can only cast it even close to correctly in storm or other combo, where the plan is pretty clear. otherwise, i'll missassign  my role and promptly lose.

What do you guys suggest I do to learn this aspect of the game? Is there a specific format that showcases the consequnces of the lack of this skill, where I can practice?

<TEXT> I was going through the depths for the first time and just got the sewer key then I opened the door to the bonfire and got invaded while pressing the button to interact with it, then died in front of the door. 

Then the same guy invaded me again, I fought him just before the basilisks in the basement. luckily, he had to kill the things to get to me, and more luckily I beat him. But I never got to even see the petrification breath, and next time through was caught completely by suprise.

Then he invaded me again, and I killed him in a spell and a combo. He didn't come back.

Just to be clear, this wasnt one of the preset invasion guys, he had a name like "ArmRAmor113" or something equally silly, this was a real guy.

This made me curious about pvp etiquite, so i looked it up.

The thing is I don't even care about this facet of online play, and killing a guy in front of his bonfire seems like a dick move.

<TEXT> that format(m14) was awesome in small doses.

KTK seemed way better upon including the rest of the block, despite being good in all the ways you stated otherwise.

kaladesh block has been them incorporating lesser versions of all their previous mistakes.

Vehicles: too good or hot garbage, depending on activation cost, see mirrodin  

improvise: not enough support, see saviors of kamigawa and "hand size matters"

fabricate: usually not a choice due to format context, arguably see tribute here.  

revolt: overreward the agressor for actions they would take anyways, see Origins and Renown.

<TEXT> the planar bridge the phyrexians and dominarians figured out 10,000 years ago, nice invention.

Seriously though, the whole reason they started this up was so that they could tell the story on the cards better. if they have to resort to the website to this extent anyways, what was the point?

keep in mind, urza block was a trainwreck because they had to add Urza artifact story at the 11'th hour. They've gotten better at getting creative and R D on the same page, but all the underlying problems still exist, which is why we got kaladesh. They still need to push iconic nonsense, In urza's block they screwed up the theme and in kaladesh they screwed up on individual cards.

In both cases, power level balance took a back seat to story. </TEXT>

If you don't, add cheerios and cephalid breakfast to begin.

If rg lands counts as combo, so does every painter variant, but also enchantress with helm/rip.

Point is ground rules need to be made across the board.

I tried every strat that was on the internet short of the one where you just stand on a balcony and chesee him with arrows/ firebombs 2-4 times each and none of them worked. Hidden body saved my life, I just used that and magic weapon, held with 2 hands and took him out in 3 hits. cleaned up the dogs after, easiest thing.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Beat the capra demon as sorcerer finally. Had to kill hydra and gold golem to get hidden body first, dogs were murdering me so I needed to take them out of the equation. 

I can now:  
-Go through the underwater place a bit, but transient curse is really expensive    
- tackle the depths, I looked around in there a bit but got kinda scared when i saw the rat get eaten by the floor.  
-go to blighttown via valley of the drakes, turns out the drakes on the ledge are easy to pull and kill, and that "nurgle" dragon isn't as scary as it looks.  
-darkroot garden pt 2 from basin, not sure if thats a can of worms I want to open yet.  
-whatever happens to be past the skelotons in firelink

I also have floating 20000 souls, I was told to use on upgrading my weapon to magic but I can't find green titanite to save my life, I can't even find large titanite for normal upgrade purposes.

Grossest enemy so far: the toad/manta/mushroom thing.

funniest: The guy i killed while he was screwing his dog in the depths kitchen. I wonder if he finished first? lol.

Most urgent mystery: The pryomancy guy said "she" while talking about who put him in a barrel, then just didn't say anything else about it. Cmon man, who did i just piss off by letting you out? I don't regret it, you're the nicest guy here, but I'd like to know what enemies I'm making here. Throw me a bone?        </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, depends on the supporting cast. I can't imagine Delver being better in this film than he was in his breakout blockbuster "Insects in the RUG", but maybe the other cast members will overperform.

Making this film on a lower budget for a niche audience should allow for greater creativity on the part of the director, too. He shouldn't be afraid to try different film techniques and casting options. 

Btw if this film becomes a cult classic, who do you think will be most scared by the unique brand of horror that this movie specialises in? I've watched " The Bugman, the Pyromaniac, and the Necro-cannibal" and that brand of horror didn't do anything for me,
especially the zombie fish thing in a world with that sick demon.


TL, DR: movie theme, budget deck should be okay and question of what this delver variant is good against.

<TEXT> Is Thing in the Ice not a good card or did everyone just forget? Honest question, it seems like exactly what you want in here both as additional threats and stuff to fight from behind.

This gives you:  

TNN : mongoose impersonation  
Thing in the ice: goyf impersonation  
delver:  delver impersonation 

Then cantrips and counterspells. If you want reach and you're really desperate, 

Psionic blast  

If you want Swords to plowshares, I guess you have "options" (shudders)

Spontanious Mutation  
Mind Harness
Pongify(for the sake of completion.)

Maybe an actual delver player can weigh in here, IDK. Does Mauseleum wanderer count as a threat for example? If so that may lower the curve, if you even want to do that.

<TEXT>  Imagine you want to cast a spell, so you press the button to do so. after a delay of about a little less than a second*, your spellcaster begins her startup animation. Now stuck like that, you need to "queue up" the direction in which you wish to dodge or walk or whatever, anticipating what the enemy is going to do next.

 Under these conditions, It feels like precision is impossible and skill of excecution is irrelevant. I have to play this like a turn based game almost, planning out the next few inputs in advance. I start to beat bosses only when Ive gotten good enough at a certain part of their pattern to be able to take that time to plan instead of react or dodge or whatever.

 Not to say this isn't extremely fun in its own way , I'm just hoping that it's sustainable.

 I've had to put some into strength to ensure I can even keep up. Magic is really really hit or miss.

 might be less than that, I just know I can say "Dracozombie" before my character reacts to a button press, so some predictive reasoning is pretty neccesary.

Nic fit goes over some of these, but not Mud, 12 post, lands, turbo depths, etc.

usually not much delver, the delver players tend to be the miracles players, and guess what they would rather sleeve up?

Please note how bad sigarda is against most of this. No one really cares about my 5/5 for five, I'll board it in when i need it thanks.  

edit: this is also why the deck needs to function without a vet, Its because vet is just a bad card some abnormally significant amount of the time, so I'm leaning on the decks ability to grind and go slightly larger. I'd just lose the game if i cast titans or whatever. That's why the deck looks the way it does.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Playing a spellcaster type build, mostly because I was told by a friend that it would be easier to do that for my first run. 

When it works it's great, but for almost every boss fight I end up having to can the magic, pull out my dorky sword, and get to chopping. Actually, i have to do this with all the knights too. I just pullout my catalyst and immediately get canned.

It seems like magic is just a quality of life thing here, to get you through most of the normal encounters in the game, but the normal encounters are getting much harder. I'm at the ghost/flooded city.

Full disclosure: I'm playing on PC, without dsfix, with a 10 meter cable hooked to my tv, on my Ps4 controller. No other setup has worked for me, I don't know how to touchtype well and dsfix doesn't seem to work with any sort of "PS controller on PC" software. The  TV makes up for visibility deficencies.

Also, the reason why I ended up cutting top for library is because I ran top for a while and then cut one for a library. library ended up being way better, so i cut another for another and finally removed top entirely.

Path just isnt a flexible enough spell for the aforementioned reasons. People have more basics than I do  around here a fair amount of the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to assume that the mana is fine, because if it isn't nothing else I say matters.

I'm going to further assume that cards with double of a single color are almost as hard to cast here as in either tezz variant.

Every time i go to say something about this deck being terrible, I take another pass over it and realize that yes, there is synergy there, and yes, you did think about this. So 2 constructive pieces of criticism:

First don't just  think of walkers as walkers, but things that hit the board and accrue card advantage over time, while also being a win condition. keranos, trading post, and thopter spy network all qualify, but I'm absolutely positive i'm not thinking of some.

Second,  If you can make space for chalice in the main, do so. Theres no downside except lack of space, and doing so overloads your opponents removal/ blanks it. You might not need the full four with trinisphere there though.

Actually, assuming this works at a basic level, This deck seems right up my alley. Too bad I don't own mox opal. Maybe modern masters 2017 will have it and that will be my chance.

Maybe they ban it in modern. Hopefully not both, that would be poor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wasteland draws cards with gitrog, makes gouys with titania, and Yeah, you can get your opponent with knight i guess.

Sigarda always makes my 75, but not always my 60.

Scryb ranger is less about the untap and more about the ramp and land rebuy, It has synergy with tracker, knight, and deathrite. could still be subpar here, but thats to be seen.

You''re probably right about truths, will keep second tracker in mind.

I'll make space for nissa, peviously was ob nixilis slot, then sorin 6, then got cut.

I'm gonna be honest, I hate that top costs mana. when i played it, i had multiple games where I lost because i had to pay mana for top to find something and promptly lost to daze or pierce.

There is a plan for miracles: generate value off all your threats, only deploy 1-2 creatures at a time, make them play around depths/ stage kill you and titania/ safekeeper kill you.  That being said, if i can find space for sigarda, ill play it. Gitrog may get the axe, not sure yet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah this whole thing is for the specific situation i mentioned, which definitly comes up.

I also didn't say anything about 1 landers, I said this is what happens if your hand has 2 lands and one doesn't make green or black mana. Consider:

mull to six on draw:  
verdant catacombs    
karakas  
cabal therapy  
Gsz  
siege rhino  
path  

you could replace Gsz with vet, or path with decay, or rhino with some decent 3 drop, or add a deed to make 7 cards. It doesn't matter that much, if you don't find land your line is pretty clear.

<TEXT> The philosophy then was to lessen the relyence on veteran exploer a little, and to make sure each card stood on its own a little better.

The cards still take advantage of having an excees of lands, so the nic fit shell is used here.

Forgot GSZ like the putz i am, fixing now.

Also I'm not going to go to the maverick threads to suggest playing 
Gitrog monster and Siege rhino.

<TEXT> You need to therapy turn one if you plan on using veteran explorer on turn 2 though, because you need to play around STP.

To actually answer the question asked, the answer to this question really depends on the rest of your hand. If your hand is disruptive, brainstorm is fine. If you are low on threats that don't immediately generate value, you need to name a removal spell. If your threats generate value,  Force of will. 

Therapy on turn one is the line you take when you have a 1-2 land hand, and one of those lands is plains or colourless. This kind of crap happens a fair bit, it turns out  when you play so many basics your mana can dump on you.

I was 80 percent or something on therapy hits, but that was early 2016 in paper magic. I'm both rusty and too unfamiliar with current lists to get that kind of rate today. Still, this advice should be sound.      </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah no. It was universal shorthand for what you just described, now it is no longer *universal* shorthand for that, and has been repurposed as shorthand for what I just described by a subset of the population. 

Now you have people who can't differentiate what shorthand you want, and when you take the phrase at face value, it doesn't even mean what it says.

It's kinda like "move to combat," or an old card not doing what it says on it and the oracle text being wrong. More like the oracle text example actually, you can't really call the judge and ask if your opponent is being sincere or being sarcastic.

you know what is sincere? This exchange:

Player B loses to screw.  
Player A- "Good Game!"
Player B-" That was not a good game. The previous game was awesome, a tight uphill battle despite a mull to 5 on the play. I almost got there! This game was a disaster, and I'm actually kind of offended that you consider it a real game of magic."

This is easy to avoid! Consider:

Player B Loses
Player A - "Thx for the games, good luck in future rounds"

No ambiguity, no unnecessary additional salt.

<TEXT> You're missing the point. I have no problem with the game having an art style,  *if it doesn't affect game play,* but the changes they made for clarity render the game entirely unwatchable. *I can't see anything that's going on.*

There's too much bloom so i cant see whats being shot, health bars block unit sprites, units blend into backgrounds, units are diificult to differentiate from each other sometimes, and on and on.

All of this is really easy to fix, just make a mod and change some values. I'd do it myself, except *I can't even evaluate the gameplay by watching the game if I can't see said game.*

I posted what i posted both because the reaction is "blame relic" instead of " blame the art guys lack of relevant experience."

I know dawn of war 3 is different from dawn of war 2. Guess what?

Starcraft 2, warcraft 3, meridian new world, orcs and humans, *dune freaking two* do not have this set of problems.

This is a problem set created by the sort of person who does not think their art decisions all the way through, and does not have employees with previous expertise making art decisions to call upon.

So not only am I not buying this game, I'm double checking to make sure these two are not making art decisions on the next RTS game before I buy that one. 

I want to see these guys have learned their lesson about "clarity"
before I buy anything they touch.

<TEXT> if  sylvius is watching: 
first remember aluren is symmetrical. that means that on shanes combo turn, you had two redraws to force.
For sideboarding, 3 sphere stops his combo cold, and cursed totem shuts off deathrite. Mana denial is even better agianst him than it is against you, so in comes the sideboard wasteland.

Honestly, i think this match comes down to you trying to leverage the virtual card advantage created by chalice coupled with the fact that every non mana card you have is usally worth two.

Shane just wants to kill your rocks and deny you mana. If you get to take more than 2 game actions per turn,
the game is over.

In game one, the clock is the same whether you plus or you minus, except that you get extra cards if you plus your tezz.

In game 2 i honestly would have sacced the chalice earlier, perhaps the previous turn. Transmute for sword is a serious out, and the way tranmute works, you wouldnt even need to pay the difference.

all in all though a good showing of the strenghts and weaknesses of blue black tezzerator. The reason why i run the grixis build is because the mana is actually better, due to the lack of double U cards and the presence of mox diamond. The curve is also lower and more interaction exists.

UB casts force better and has slightly better walkers.Except daretti. Daretti is so often the reason games are won.

<TEXT> It can however be a dick move to call at game good when it is nothing of the sort.

It also does not help that good game has become the shorthand for "I win" or "I'm going to win" or "You can't win from this position" depending on when you say it.

Streamers saying "I think this is gg guys" exemplifys this fact, and paints the "pony league handshake" as a dying relic of a previous age, twisted and weaponized by online personalities with no respect for the fact that they play against a person, and if that person could hear their side of the screen they would  consider this "faux sportmanship" rude.

It looks extremely favorable for the dredge player against most of this, honestly. this obviously only applies assuming normal sideboards and all 20 decks in the meta.

<TEXT> So you do not acknowledge that nongames exist?

I'm  trying to form a baseline for conversation here. losing sucks, but as I said in the OP, is not my main concern. My main concern is the ability to play the game of magic that I sat down to play.

If my opponent shuts that down, they did their job. If my deck fails to put up token resistance or a token offence, that's a problem.

There is no fun game in which you have no meaningful input. Thats not just magic, that's games in general. The games where that happens and you win are only mitigated by the fact that there is some sort of prize on the line, and then not much. the games where that happens and you lose have no redeeming value most of the time, with the exception being the opponents being pretty nice about it.

The line of thought I have, emotionally, for these games is " I did not sit down for a bad interactive movie, I sat down for magic."

Intellectually, I know that these games happen so infrequently as to be statistically insignificant, maybe %5 -6 percent of games, but i have a hard time separating the emotion from the variance without 
just moving on to the next game of magic.

This thread is really just a purge of the remaining 5-6 percent of salt games.        </TEXT>

<TEXT> okay let me be even more clear:

losing to wasteland: fine, I should have played more basics.
losing to blood moon on turn one: also fine, same reason.
losing to counterbalance lock, or lucky topdecks, or my own mistakes, or a deck reg error, or drawing an extra card by accident at comp rel? 
All totally fine.

The subset of games that I play where neither player has any meaningful impact on the outcome? Yeah this is where the salt comes from.

It also doesn't last longer than it takes for the next "good game of magic," and the more magic I get to play, the less likely this is to happen. For example, a gp? Never salty. A monthly event? Only if there isn't  a draft i can get into.  Draft till you drop round one loss to screw? Not happening. Prerelease? kick my arse and give me another please.

The commanality is the ability to say "Whatever, I'll just go play magic over there.

<TEXT> again sorry I wasn't more clear in the op. 

My salt comes from the specific subsection of games in which neither player has any meaningful influence on the outcome, the ones where it doesn't matter what my oppenent killed me with,  I could not play magic.

No amount of money fixes this problem. 

If my opponent storms me out of the game, I should have played more turn 0 interaction. That's on me. 

If my opponent locks me out with counter top, I should have played more varied mana costs.

If my opponent wastes all my land, I should have played more basics. 

If i draw an extra card at comp rel, I needed to be more careful.

However if i mulligan to 5 on the play and see no lands, and then my opponent wins, then neither i nor my opponent had a meaningful impact on the game, with the small exception of him playing a 2/2.

These are not "real games," these are "nongames," and it seems from talking to other people locally that I have a much stricter view that they of what consistutes such.

<TEXT> In a perfect world, I would agree  with you.

In the world we live in, the increased power of the individual to collect information is the only way to fight the increased power of the organisation to mislead and obfuscate.

This doesn't even have to be intentional, as time goes on, it becomes more and more clear that TYT for example has its own series of biases. 

Actually scratch that. Anyone who thinks that TYT hid their bias at any point was paying woefully little attention to all the times they said " We're biased, but we quote our sources and try to be as factual as possible "

On context, the historical, societal and cultural stuff behind voter id laws are fact, not opinion, and as such that stuff isn't up for debate. If you look into that stuff and say that its strange to not have them, you have formed an opinion based on the facts you have.

The only thing  I could say is maybe to give related facts too?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, checking the source, it doesn't look like the chart differentiates black nationalists from black separatists, and it really should as there is a difference. Because blacks are a minority in the states, black nationalists can't really get away with saying stuff like "peaceful ethnic cleansing" 

If/when blacks become the majority, we can talk about rebalancing the other way a bit. I'm sure that at that point, blacks will start talking about genocide, and whites will have to fight it, because being an idiotic homicidal dick knows no color.

Not right now though, right now we gotta try to balance this way.

Cenk is going to need to at least look into this though, if something challenges your worldview, you need to verify it and then reexamine what you believe in the context of the new info.

I understand the Wtf emotional phase though. I just had to fight through it myself. I need more verifiable data to compare to before i just take this at face value though.

*doesn't show difference between white nationalist and white separatists either,  much less of a difference here though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think thats it for me, due to the fact that it's very easy for me to forget to tilt during any game after the one in which I had reason to believe i got unlucky, coupled with the fact that I spend a bit of time trying to find reasons why being salty is unreasonable before deciding that yes, I did get somewhat unlucky and given the circumstances, a modicum of salt would not be entirely untoward.

Of course this becomes a bit of a problem whenever someone asks how my last round went. Nothing refills the salt shaker like having your round 3 opponent ask you how your event is going when you lose to screw/flood in round 1 and then get the bye in round 2.      </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Been playing breakfast off and on for about a month now, and i need some help with my lists mana. I'm not actually sure how much mana to put in here, given the list that i'm running.

The most relevant part:

lands: ?

brainstorm 4  
ponder 4  
gitaxian probe 4   
aether vial 4   

Full list :  
4 brainstorm  
4 ponder   
4 probe  
4  aether vial  
4 force of will  
4 nomads en kor  
4 cepalid illusionist  
3 narcomoeba  
1 shaman en kor  
3 recruiter of the guard  
3 cabal therapy  
1 dread return  
1 azami, lady of scrolls  
1 labrotory maniac  
1 angel of glory's rise  
3 daze  

cards that can be cut:  
1 x therapy  
2- 4 probes  
1x ponder  
1 x force  
1x swamp

current mana:  
1 swamp   
1 island  
1 plains  
4 flooded strand  
4 polluted delta  
2 hallowed fountain  
2 underground sea  
1 scrubland  
1 cavern of souls  

how the deck works for the uninitiated:   
step 1 : play nomad  
step 2 : play illusionist, infinitely target it with nomad to mill yourself, therapy your opponent and then yourself to get rid of dead cards, then dread return angel to reanimate azusa/ lab man and win.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interestingly, opening a crummy sealed pool is still a situation that someone can meaningfully influence. Winning with garbage is worth a modicum of bragging rights, if nothing else.

Getting mana screwed can be a problem in deck construction or mulligan decisions, and usually I think about that before I move to the salt step.

I have so few things in the first catagory that it might be shining a magnifier on this stuff when it happens.

Sometimes whether a loss is your fault or not can be hidden information,  like when you lose in the deckbuilding phase of a new deck after having a lot of success with it because you are playing one less land than you should be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> should have been more clear.

Its not necessarily the outcome of the game, but how much control I/my opponent has over it. If I lose because I threw away my guy for no value, or  my opponent countered all my spells, or even because I screwed up and drew an extra card at comp rel, That's fine.  None of those things are affected by the kind of variance that grinds my gears.

mulling twice into a four land hand and drawing two more lands over 4 turns is where I start getting a little bit irate, but only if I run down the list of " Did i build my deck wrong?" type of things, and only until the next game that I have input into.

The salt can only exist inside and immediately after a bad game of magic, one where the outcome of the game is entirely decided by the vagaries of randomness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really admire people that can do that, but I don't seem to have it in me. The best approximation I have is to try to recognize  when I can positively influence a situation, but of course this appproach can suck in the face of situations beyond my control.

It's  interesting because IRL I don't stress over that kind of thing. I suspect that it's because magic obfuscates what you can or can't influence so often that it becomes hard to identify what you have influence over.

<TEXT> I should have been much more clear. I get salty sometimes when I lose matches in which I have such minimal input that what my opponent does to beat me almost doesn't matter. The litmus test for those is " If all my opponents cards were grizzly bears, would they have still won the game?" There is very little to learn from games like that. 

I'm approaching all my games like playtesting sessions. In that context, losing "grizzily bear games" are the worst, followed by winning such games, followed by getting the bye, followed by whatever.

The best losses are to grindy control decks, because there is so much data to work with there, followed closely by losing to something I haven't seen before, followed by something I haven't yet played against.   </TEXT>

between games however, yeah. I usually reserve my bullcrap for after the match, and then only air it if I can't come up with a reason I deserved to lose to my deck falling apart.

deck constuction, deck choice and mulligan decisions are all places where if I get mana screwed it could be my fault, and I try to consider all of that before I begin the saline infusion.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lately I realize that I'm getting a little too salty when I lose. I recognize that variance is a thing in magic, and i feel like the reason why  take things so hard is because I just don't get to play enough magic.    
4-7 matches per week is just not enough to divorce the salt from the variance.

I should add that the way I "desalinate" is always by playing more magic. My  goal in any given tournament is to play the maximum
amount of magic, sometimes to the detriment of my win loss record but not to the detriment of my opponents.  

I should also add that traveling an 1 - 1.5 hours to play 3-4 rounds of magic and then spending that same time traveling back makes getting the bye seem awful in the context of my goal of playing the most possible magic.    </TEXT>

If Thiel told his opponent, before calling a judge, "So just to be clear here, the phrasing that you used to pass priority from your main phase is a commonly used shorthand for moving to the declare attackers step. If you would like to move back to the previous step, I'm going to need to call the judge and get him to rewind the game state, because I don't know what the penalty is for doing that myself at this level of play, or even if there is one,"

All I know is everyone says "Programming is hard,"  "Just keep at it", and " You give up to easy." 
Cool, so i should go back to solving the thing I've working on for 20 hours because I give up too easily.

but that doesn't jive with this:  "You mean you're doing tiny problems to help you learn the basics, and it's not obvious to you that it shouldn't take half a work week to solve a single problem? What the fuck?"

<TEXT> What official resources, msdn? I didn't even know it existed until halfway through my second year trying to learn. 

If not msdn, i dont actually know what official resources that you are referring to.

Just to give you an idea of how borked I've been, I started with c++ for dummies while using New Boston for a video resource. I did that for six months, then tried to do some pretty basic multi-file and inheritance stuff and hit a softwall doing multiple inheritance.

I then dropped that for a bit to change gears, using SDL to do a series of videos for a bit before  striking out on my own as far as trying to make a text rpg. This is something i managed to get working, before I got over ambitious  and learned the hard way to google version control for the first time.

Just to be clear, I didn't know to google version control, I found out that there was a thing called version control after trying to find out if there was a better way to save my files.

I got pretty discouraged for a while, then came back and gave myself a refresher on the basics using Codeabbey/another video series/ a bunch of c++ ebooks. After doing well enough that I thought that I could move on to making my own  stuff again, I started doing that, then unreal engine became free and my eyes got bigger than my brain(or some such analogy).

I proceeded to screw around with doing stuff with that for 2 months off and on while still doing the other stuff,  learning naming conventions and code organization and all this other stuff that i thought there was no other way  I would be able to understand without looking at a complex code base.

I then tried to do something (cant remember what), got discouraged when it didn't work and I couldn't fix it(!), took a break and refocused again.

Right now I'm using a Udemy course to learn the Unity engine while
working on unity side project stuff. C#. 

Lately I've come to the realization that programming video tutorials are awful if you want to do any sort of review of information. I just want a transcript of these videos. Or ideally, a freaking textbook. A good one for once in my life.     

Edit: Ha, case in point, see mod reply. I really wish I knew that reddit existed more than 6 months ago, would have saved me a lot of grief I think.       </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been having a hard time understanding the basics of various
things for a while now, and it may be because of the tools i'm using to learn. I'm getting there, but it is extremely slow going.

I just last week noticed that the vast majority of learning resources I had been using  are marked as discouraged resources here. 

I usually see a cool new concept, make sure i understand it, then go to implement it and realize i don't understand it at all. This usually results in me spending 20+ hours over the next week or so 
trying to figure out what it is about the latest thing that i don't understand.

My understanding of a thing is entirely based on if i got exactly that thing working before, because i have no confidence that i can get a variant of that thing running in any reasonable amount of time.    

Not having milestones on a reasonable path to proficiency is also
eroding any confidence I may have left. Even a " Now that you know  X, Y and Z, you should be able to do this" would be helpful.

I have no idea where my gaps  even are, and this might be due to the moving from tool to tool and resource to resource I've done every few months. 

I would just like to have something like a way to compare what I think i know, what i can actually execute, and what I should know after 4 years at this.    </TEXT>

just playing for leovold or wasteland or EMA karakas is probably good enough, and a set of those things instead of a dual for first place in a monthly is probably good enough if the community is smallish.

honestly, 8 man event - $20 buy in 8x20 = 200  200/40 = 5, so that gets a set of wastes for first, and $40 cred for second. EMA wastes are less than that on scg right now even, so you can run it yourself and take a cut.       </TEXT>

For reference: Ant is a combo deck that looks to win on turn 2-3. it usually plays 14 lands. Those lands all produce colored mana. Ant also has 4 other free sources of mana. Ant also has 4 brainstorm, 4 ponder, 4 probe and a Sensei's divining top or preordain in order to filter through its draws.

This thing has nothing resembling any of that, and has less land, some of which cant cast spells on its own.
This is a disaster waiting to happen.

So in the interest of constructive criticism, here is how i would build what it seems like you want to do here.

dorks  
4 birds   
4 hierach  

locks:  
4 thalia heretic cathar   
4 winter orb  
4 root maze  


interaction:  
4 swords to plowshares  

green suns package:  
1 dryad militant  
1 dryad arbor  
4 green suns zenith  
2 scryb ranger  
1 quasali pridemage   

beaters:   
4 greenbelt rampager/greenwheel liberator / dependent on windswept heath  
2 thrun the last troll  
3 knight of the reliquary/  dependent on heath  

mana:   
4 windswept heath  
4 wasteland  
9 forest  
1 plains  

the rest are up to you, but honestly this whole idea seems like a worse version of sylvan plug. I'd consider that unless you are under REALLY tight budgetary constraints. The deck i listed has it's own set of problems.

cards to consider:
renegade ralier  
tarmogoyf / I assumed budgetary concerns

<TEXT> So i just got into legacy on magic online today. I bought the fireslinger precon and 30 tickets,

spent them on some fringe burn choices, and went 3-2 beating UR delver, miracles and miracles, and losing to turbo-depths and merfolk.

list as follows:
4 chain lightning  
4 bolt  
4 rift bolt  
4 swiftspear  
4 guide  
4 lava spike  
4 flame rift  
4 price of progress

2 scald  
2  exquisite firecraft  
2 meltdown  
1 sulfuric vortex  

got 120 play points and a rugged prarie( 11 tix)

My question is : What should i spend that on? </TEXT>

Also, green suns for melira if you want it.

<TEXT> I just looked and Death and taxes has only 5-0 d 4 times out of 96 undefeateds, which gives it around the same win rate as dredge.

We know that's not right, but the source has it as a deck to beat and has done so for a while.

I know why theres no taxes, thats not the issue.

I don't think we can use Mtgo results when prepping for paper tournaments.

Come to think of it, I don't think wizards should use mtgo results when considering
 bannings, and I think people should consider paper legacy and online legacy two different formats when discussing the health of the meta. 

I'm willing to be proven wrong, this is more off the cuff than anything.    </TEXT>

A cursory glance at mtgo 5-0 lists shows only 4 taxes lists in the last 14 days.

thats 4/96, not counting the legacy challenge.

dredge has 3/96, which means "dodge D T" is about as valid a plan as "dodge dredge." </TEXT>

Doesnt look like this version can beat a resolved leovold in game 1 very easily. cunning wish for bounce looks like the only out and that costs...

Actually, thinking about it, it doesnt matter. high tide- cunning wish - snap means youre only down 1  mana more than you would be anyways,  and the leovold decks dont have that much interaction anyways.

If the mtgo meta looks anything like what i saw in the dragon stompy post, this could be a good choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> burn is also an absolutely fantastic way to get a hands on feel for the more subtle ways in which the power level of legacy differs from modern. as well as learn which play patterns are open for punishment and how.

You'll learn that cracking a fetch at the wrong time can be exploited by burning to play around counterspells, and that price of progress is possibly the most terrifying burn spell ever printed.

If you stick with burn, you'll learn that the deck has a suprising amont of flex in how it attacks a meta.

I got home too late to catch the stream. You started a little early.

As per our arrangement, I owe you a donation. I couldnt have beat grixis in the swiss without you. just tell me when you have it ready.  

Yeah that top 8 was pretty representative of the local level of playskill here. 

Note miracles did not make top8, and sometimes that happens here. There were 4 miracles players that i saw, one of whom was another GP top 8 contender, and more that i didn't see i'm sure. 

I'll have to ask about, but i think miracles has been underperforming lately for the last few months.

I want to believe we've hated it out, but I realize I gotta check the numbers.

<TEXT> Jtms isnt even good with lash. and this is another thing, if a deck is going through this stage of development, it probably has at least three variants that differ wildly from each other.

pointing to a deck at that point and saying "this is thought lash" is
 counterproductive in the extreme, its like if miracles was still in the dev stage and someone pointed at Quadlazer Miracles and judged the archetype based on how playable or not that version was.

<TEXT> trying to make it happen. The resilliency, power, and flexibility are there for sure. The deck can be hard to play, a mix between high tide and show and tell with counter top for protection and a moat type effect built in. 

you play a game where you try to stick top, bait with counterbalance, then jam thought lash with backup. 

thought lash + top will find you lab man while blanking your opponents attacks, then when you play lab man  your instant speed cantrips proceed to be protection spells by virtue of putting "you win the game" triggers on the stack. Even top just sits there and makes them cringe.

post board you get access to back to basics as a haymaker. 

I want to try a black splash for fatal push and lim duls vault.

btw, I don't see why stuff that hasn't been tried in a while gets blasted so hard on these boards.

its unplayable until someone top 8s with it, then some guy goes and scrubs with it because he doesnt see the decks interactions, deems it unplayable on camera/ stream, and then anyone who brings it up gets laughed at. </TEXT>

1st landstill, 18 points. Lam Phan of GP jersey top 8 fame, cocreator of canadian thresh
2nd deadguy ale, 15 points. Wilkin Chow, local legacy pro and the only reason deadguy wont stay dead
3rd grixis delver, Boston (really sorry cant remember your last name) Grixis delver Expert.

I know I came sixth, but rankings are hazy and i didnt take notes. there was Brian bogdon on deadguy(disciple of chow) Josh Trank on lands( pretty good lands player), Someone on reids leovold thing, and i cant remember the 8th person.
miracles missed top 8 on breakers of %3 or something.

I beat miracles twice, grixis once and a close one to pox for my win and in. lost to bogdon on deadguy,
and unintentional drew with trank due to my own incompetence.

I played grixis tezzerator.

kill with lab man, thought lash mostly blanks eldrazi, excellent choice in heavy combo metas. 

it helps that your combo dodges chalice, and that you main counter-top.

millions of ways to win in response to stuff when you have the combo in play.

upgrade path to miracles and show and tell variants.

less linear than oops and belcher, doesnt die to counterbalance like high tide or reset tide.

cards that cost + $ 30 canadian : 4 force of will, 2 ancient tomb.

<TEXT> Look at the "decks to beat" on the source. Its easy to see metas where eldrazi and BR reanimator get wrecked. Or elves, or lands, or sneak show, or storm, or a half dozen other things I'm not thinking of.

These metas are common. Hell we lived in all of them at various points throughout 2016- 2017. 

But these metas are not usual, because the rest of the time these decks are great choices.  

I don't think I'm being hurtful to anything but players who don't consider bringing something spare when they have the option just in case.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> br reanimator also is good against the unprepared, which other people who have to proxy for an event will tend to be on average.

Bonus win% if you can play something that wins quickly   its unclear what to force to stop the combo.

Burn WILL pants people unfamiliar with the format. The first time they tap out thinking that they are safe because you only have 2 cards in hand, then you bolt, price of progress fireblast them out of the game, "Just the Burn deck" wont be a thing they will say for a while.

That goes for you too. 4 damage for free and 6-8 with 2 mana completely changes how many cards they need in hand to kill you.  1 mana, 1 card three damage is modern burn, modern fire philosophy. in legacy its more like 1.5 mana ,1 card, 4 damage. This makes it so that burn needs 5 cards or less to kill you rather than 7. </TEXT>

Just signed up for twitch for you guys.

magic highlights: 
-Learn the dangers of the four-color manabase  

-See the advantages and disadvantages of the card delver of secrets

-See a comprehensive deconsruction of all in red and its place in the current legacy meta.

- first appearence of cephalid breakfast 2017

- bonus legacy cube draft, perfect showcase of the mono-green ramp archetype

non magic highlights
 - one of the hosts is psychologically tortured live by a ghost from his past. His mind breaks down to the point he doesn't even realize his tormentor has given him a way out until someone else explicitly confirms it.
It  mirrors something out of lovecraft, in structure if not severity. definitely worth a watch for this if nothing else.

criticisms are: fix mic sensitivity so you can be you without pissing off the part of your audience that wants a lttle less you, give plus 5 seconds for lag to catch up before making a difficult play(the audience can have trouble contacting you with info you havent yet considered. Lag.)

Maybe talk about a weird list once per stream.  Players love lists.

the thing you mostly nailed that most streamers get wrongish at first is finding the balance between playing at a reasonable pace and talking to your audience. Especially in a CoCast situation. Its hard and you guys made it look easy, flavor text of eternal warrior style.
Mad Props.

On visibility: I'm pretty sure that your reddit stream annoucement is mostly responsible for your viewer  count. Like, you click on the legacy reddit and the first thing you see is "hey guys, come watch us play legacy?' how do you not get viewers from that?    </TEXT>

<TEXT> gilded drake is horible against tempo, this card is great against it, but only when you're trying to execute certain strategies. 

certain combo decks in particular may want this over drake.

on braid of fire, be careful to remember when you are testing that card to think about when carpet of flowers would have done a similar job in that slot if you changed your sequencing.

the cards are so close to each other given the way that enchantress plays out that you should probably make sure that braid is the correct meta call.

<TEXT> You may not be able to run decay or push. 
as i said most of grixis delvers threats, most of BUGs threats depending, etc see opening post.

i agree with you against infect though, 1 target likely isn't enough.

This isn't supposed to stick around though. It's more of a mid-late tempo play where you take someting for two turns at most and try to end the game before the upkeep becomes untenable. 

the applications are fringe, but some decks want access to the type of cheap, temporary tempo swing that this card provides. 

you may be correct about the submerge point though, in that the tempo gained is less temporary but less severe. 

I guess we are comparing time ebb to doom blade to act of treason though, which kind of invalidates the comparison.

Just irks me that this stuff only makes people look like a genius in hindsight, and then only when they don't get their skill downplayed  by people saying " yeah he had to get lucky to top8 with that garbage.

<TEXT> There is no community consensus on that.

lands is a meta/gimmick deck, it has a hard time against combo. if your meta is combo, don't bring lands.

this statement is true, this statement is representative of the kind of statement that can be said of a lot of tier 1.5 + legacy decks, and this statement is awkward for the purpose of measuring how good a deck lands is.

The truth is, most non-blue (and some blue based) legacy decks are garbage in common but not usual metagame situations.

<TEXT> Ended up not going to the Saturday one and 3-1 ing with tezzerator on Friday. Found 1 transmute under my couch last minute.

Lost to miracles 1-2, beat dredge 2-0, UB reanimator 2-1, and GU eldrazi stompy 2-0.

Stompy featured maindeck trinisphere and elder deep fiend. 

meta was very different from previous three weeks, multiple copies of UB reanimator, BR,reanimator, burn, dredge, and deadguy,  with much less miracles, stompy, death and taxes, and other chalice decks than usual.
filling out the meta with jund, lands,aggro loam, and 1 delver deck. 

The Breakfast deck is kinda bad against bug decks with push because of the sheer volume of interaction those decks have. Push + Decay + Thoughtseize + Deathrite + Force to start with, Golgari Charm +  Surgical in the board. 
I could beat some of this pre-push because Decay+ Deathrite + Force is too slow sometimes and not enough some of the other times, but push gives that deck 1 mana creature removal pre-board.

post- board transform is terrible in the face of golgari charm and increased -1-1 effects, to fight True-name out of bug.

It doesn't look like people have adapted to new printings yet though, Hmm.       </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah if you are new, you have no idea what you can and cant force. Furthermore, you don't have enough experience with the format to know what matchups are grindy, or what grindy decks have a combo finish.

For new players, Force is a safety net to cover all the other mistakes they make in deck choice, format knowledge, deckbuilding, mulligans, etc.

Before they even get to sideboarding they probably need force just to make up for being new.

<TEXT> It's really hard to have this conversation without knowing precisely how strongly you feel about certain decks and strategies.

It seems to me that you want a format with no non-blue strategies present? 

as in, right now, you have decks that are non-blue that pick up games against other non-blue decks,
but only exist really to target the blue decks of the format. This means that  the biggest threat to some of these decks is each other. (and consistency obv.) 

So as i understand it, You want to get these things out of the format entirely so that people will only play good decks(blue decks).

You acknowledge at the start of the article that people cannot switch decks that they are invested in,
so you acknowledge that the people affected by these changes will not be able to find even the success that they have, so they will have to either change decks or quit the format.

I guess I just dont know what you are trying to accomplish.         </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cool, you believe that non-blue decks are this side of unplayable, so you want to ban all the cards that make it so that  non-blue decks even look playable to the subset of people that enjoy playing them.

Your goal is not to ban cards that hurt the format. I have no idea what your goal is, but the one you stated isn't it. The only positive thing that could come out of this is perhaps a more honest conversation on the prevalence of blue, but that you also said you don't care about blue(and by extention brainstorm)
being prevalent.

Honest question: what do you think happens to miracles' percentage of the meta after your proposed changes?

follow up/ related question: What cards/strategies do you think would be effective against miracles following said changes. 

The reason i ask these things is because I don't think you can make such changes without having some idea of what the format will look like after the fact.

<TEXT> I'm testing it now, card's pretty good so far. casting cost is a little restrictive, but gets cast when i need to cast it, so meh. 

Definitely fills the hole i need to fill, which is a plan that doesn't rely on the graveyard. Been testing against miracles and bug delver, and is much better than the stoneforge mystic plan in concert with smugglers copter, while taking less slots.

It does have less synergy with the sideboard plan i'm currently using. so that's a real downside.    </TEXT>

a common game one scenario is that you can't combo for some reason, and this gives your opponent another thing to be terrified of.

<TEXT> This seems fine, three bears a turn is powerful. Each individual card is fine, rando bears have synergy with the rest of the deck. Sylvan is good anyways, especially in junk fit.

Miracles would have a fit dealing with this btw, it's like build your own planeswalker. Good to grind, breaking it up leaves it partially functional.

Three bears always reminds me of Great Bears of Gallowswood for some reason. Warmachine thing, for those who get it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> it was more that i wanted to see what a storm deck with 4 main deck decay would look like, and certain design decisions led to others. Past in flames was played as a 2 of in the main, once you do that, taiga or grove. Grove implies pfire, and the deck slows way down to make that card more relevant.

The deck was a weird grinding station variant, with the focus to defeat miracles.

I test everything I can consider to be remotely playable, on the off chance that there is a meta in which the deck is good. I can run this deck on that day in that meta,  and then not play it when the meta looks more normal. usaually that is 1-2 weeks later.

This is how i find what success i have in this format. If i played the same deck week in week out, I would get good with it, but never as good as the players who already do so.   

I've gotten pretty good at predicting what people will play at a given store in my area, up to a tournament attendance of 35-40 players.

I wouldn't dream of recommending this kind of thing to people who garner enjoyment from choosing one very good deck and mastering it, or someone going into any kind of open meta. You'd get slaugtered pulling this crap on mtgo for example.  </TEXT>

taxes in legacy must immediately identify the strategy that the oppenent is attempting to employ, and now with the addition of prelate, must also identify the answers to your stategy as well. 

Sometimes you must do this turn one. the diference  between thalia and stoneforge, between mother and vial, beteween prelate on one and prelate on two is often the difference between victory and defeat.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "You know, you would be far better off by keeping the deathrite untapped to prevent ANT from going off with past in flames sigh. And you complain to me about looking at things in a vaccuum? -_-"

This was just to counter the lack of nuance involved in saying this is
going to happen turn 3. I get that you want to shoot down my argument, but stuff gets lost when you do this. This is better than casting shardless agent in either spot.
  
"no card is going to lock out storm, "just buying time" is all you want."
-Not as a 3 CMC card in BUG shells, no!
 I  view this as wrong. You take anything you can get as a 3CMC card in bug shells. 

And the reason you don't understand what i'm talking about is that I never argued against "not strong", I argued against " negligible difference." Which, lets be clear, is a separate issue from you saying
shardless bug did not exist prior to this card's printing.

You look like you forgot that our conversation was happening in the context of a previous one. 

my whole thing was Leovold is better than the garbage that was usually in that slot against ANT.

whatever here's the rephrase of everything I said so far, because you took me apart before realising that you had no idea what i was even trying to say.

I mostly agree with you, with the caveat that having a slot that does something instead of nothing and that synergizes with sideboard options in a minor fashion makes bug midrange strategies better against storm by a minor amount, which is compounded by the surge in this type of deck to make a not insignificant change in the meta.

<TEXT> you're looking at the card in a vacuum, which is the wrong way to do it. the card is getting played in bug, which has deathrite. so turn 2 sometimes. 

no card is going to lock out storm, "just buying time" is all you want. 

This card is just another thing that compliments discard and countermagic to create an advantage that previously did not exist. It's not "win-more", the decks that are playing this weren't winning against storm, so its nice that both halves are relevant in the matchup, so you have better things to board out. 

I think one of storm's good matchups got slightly worse, which is a notewothy if minor contributor to storm's performance when combined with the increase in bug decks.

If The Rift is arguing this is a major contributor to "the fall of storm," i defenitlely disagree.  </TEXT>

Collectors edition yo.

Also warcraft 3 is in some disc sleeves somewhere, and i'm looking at a shareware copy of dune 2 to my right.

I never did finish that game, and hilariously my desktop case still has a disk storage drive. Maybe I can get it to work...

<TEXT> same models as what the tabletop game? If so whatever tweaks they made to those models are pretty sketchy. Dynamic positioning helps the table minis too.

You're right. That isn't how winning a war or RTS works. From the videos I've seen, that's how winning the campaign of this rts in particular works, and I cant say anything different for multiplayer because  they haven't shown us any yet.  

Let me be clear: When i say you can throw away units, I mean that from what I've seen, in the campaign,  throwing away units is something that you can do on the regular and not get punished enough to create any real additional challenge in finishing the level.

And yes textures are lazy. not bad in and of themselves, but in the context of the other textures surrounding them. Not lazy enough that they can be ignored completely to allow a focus on gameplay
(dawn of war 1, starcraft 2, meridian new world) and not detailed enough that they draw your attention(Dawn of war 2, company of heroes, Grey goo) But some in-between state, of thinking hard about what game they wanted to make, but not thinking about the design aspects affected by the changes made  to make that game.

So, half-assed basically(Although i realize the danger in minimizing the amount of thought that did go into this, and that they probably think they DID think this through all the way.

I also realize that Multiplayer could operate differently, emphasizing
unit preservation because of the increased need and difficulty of holding an extremely important objective.

I still cant buy it on account of not being able to distinguish a damn
thing. These aren't my main complaints, and i really hope that more people don't take them as such.

My main problem is that between overdone particles, extra-bland textures, things like rangers looking like guardians, lockstep model animations, Size-of-Model being uniformly the same, health bars blocking the unit behind them, and so forth. the game is unwatchable for me and by extension unplayable for me.            </TEXT>

what they want by clarity pretty freaking soon and now that the game is 
A: well received by their target audience(Not people who like the type of rts that relic popularized)

I believe it will be up to a mod community to 'create' and popularize

<TEXT> okay, but are you saying i'm looking at a video and it is unwatchable for me, so i should buy the game and see if it is unplayable for graphics reasons? 

Or are you saying i should play starcraft first. Because i grew up on those games, and starcraft is sitting on my shelf, and i assure you that those games did not have these problems.

Lets be clear, none of these things are game-breakers individually, and none of them are unfix-able, but taken together make the game completely unwatchable for me personally, and by extension unplayable.

Easily mod-fixable(as much as anything is easy in development)
depending on the tools in question.   </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-01-08 08:39:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I played dawn of war 1 and 2, and if the footage is anything to go by this game is basically unplayable for me.

I can't see any unit that any eldar unit is shooting at.

I can't see any unit behind the giant heatlh bars.

There are no unit type indicators, which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for all this bloom.

Everyone moves in lockstep, how hard would it be to just make stagger the animations a little. Just assign a number to each unit, and put a bit of a delay on all the ones with an odd number. 
Actually, get me to do it, I'll code it for you, I volunteer.
I did just do exactly this five hours ago.

I have a buddy who is a professional artist who told me that this game breaks a lot of rules of character design 101, the main thing being that a characters silhouette should have a shape distinct from the others.

He also said the textures are generally lazy. I replied that my eyes wanted to slide off the backgrounds, but defended it by saying that they wanted it to run on low end computers. Then i saw the frame rate drop and facepalmed.

One of the  things i really like about the 40k universe is that it doesn't matter what aspect of the IP you happen to be playing, things operate the same way. A shuriken cannon is the same whether you're playing Dawn of war or Battlefleet gothic.

What the heck is going on in the eldar trailer? I think the dire avengers have shuriken cannons and the rangers have brightlances? (first 15 minutes of the trailer, after that my head started to hurt.)

This is particularly bonkers because they said they did all this stuff
for clarity. Pretty clear this game is unplayable for me without a change in character design, animation design, and a generous brown layer(Which definitely is not the way you want to fix this, by making everything more brown. Also not likely to happen, first they have to acknowledge that this is a problem.)

sucks, i was looking forward to this until i saw pics, then cautiously optimistic until i saw video, then hoping all races weren't a trianwreck until i saw eldar, now i might forget 2 years from now how bad this was and buy on a steam sale for 10 dollars.

My only hope is that a mod community fixes this. if the tools aren't garbage, I might try my hand. Depends how much control we have, but custom animations and assets are things we have had access to before in this series, withe the exception of the GFWL fiasco.          

Bonus: No exp? looks like we throw our marines and eldar into a meat grinder. I understand big battles, but there's little reason to micro if you can throw units away like this. 

Why are marines, eldar and orks the same size?

Those buildings look a little bland. Sure that objective looks like a com tower, but from a high end mobile game or something.

Is it just me or does Starcraft look more GrimDark than this? I mean, graphics are less important than gameplay, but when you
have things this bright you undercut the setting, which undercuts the story, which undercuts the emotionanal investment in the campaign, which ... undercuts gameplay. Huh. Well Then.

My latest problem is such:

I have an aether vial deck that also plays cantrips, daze, force and therapy. there are 19 creatures, and 7 cantrips. there are 5 three-drops, 8 two-drops  and 6 one- drops.

This deck also plays no wasteland, as it is a combo deck.

I'm getting flooded with 18 land,  and currently my deck has three basics.
color screw isnt a problem, though that could be a function of games being over before i can get wastelanded.

<TEXT> The biggest hole in the pod chain used to be two drops, but now we have grim flayer.
Can confirm, pontiff is great.

do the rhino , sigarda and titania are good finishers.
podding titania token into sylvan safekeeper is gas.
play knight of the reliquary as a three.

Honestly, the key here is that each card is a threat individually, so that you reduce the reliance on pod. 
value creatures are not really the way to go, When you pod you want to sac a guy that is falling behind on the board state for a guy that is now the best thing in town.

no value guy is gonna be better than just drawing three with painful truths. Pod is a repeatable-use board state superiority spell, using it as a value generator is going to get you killed.

edit: five forests is two forests way too many, cut one for volraths stronghold so you can rebuy podded guys.
edit edit: sylvan library is Really Good. gets better with multi rhino.

extremely weird things happened all night, none of those games were normal. I don't think any reasonable conclusions can be drawn.

I also have no real experience casting brainstorm and ponder in decks that are not ANT or TES, So me being just bad at decks with blue in them is a real factor.

Small sample size is small. I really just posted this to give people an idea of what the deck could look like in 2016.

<TEXT> first up the list:  
combo 9    
celaphid illusionist 4  
nomads en-kor 4  
shaman en-kor 1  

kill 7  
narcomoeba 3  
angel of glory's rise 1  
azami, lady of scrolls 1  
labrotory maniac 1  
dread return 1  

protection 16

aether vial 4  
mother of runes 2  

search 3  
recruiter of the guard 3  

cantrips 7  
brainstorm 4  
ponder 3   


lands 18  
cavern of souls 1  
hallowed fountain 2  
underground sea 2  
flooded  strand 4  
polluted delta 4  
island 1  
starlit sanctum 1  
plains 1  
scrubland 1   
karakas 1  

sideboard: 3 true-name, 2 phantasmal image,3 StP, 2 dark confidant,2 disenchant,
1 grand abolisher, 1 therapy, 1 Winter orb.

The combo is to assemble celephid illusionist plus an en-kor,mill your deck getting your narcos, then dread return angel of glory's rise and tap your lab man to azami  FTW.

This list is super raw, the numbers are all wrong, and the santcum shouldn't be there.

Round 1: infect  
Game 1  
My opponent mulls to five and cant find pump, disruption, or cantrips. I kill him turn 5 after brainstorm, ponder, ponder fetching away garbage the whole time, i finally recruit for nomad.
I board out teh combo 
Game 2  
i therapy and miss, my opponent has surgical for therapy and i don't force, so he gets the one in my hand and sees how i boarded. i swords his inkmoth on turn 3 and my opponent draws like garbage. he trys to kill me with noble hierarch, but swords daze force blue card are having none of that. my board when the game ends is double true name vial, some lands. 

round 2 burn  
Game 1  
opponent mulls to five, i kill turn three.

keep the combo in the deck, board daze for therapy
Game 2   
I draw 1 land all game, fortunately daze and force hold down the fort while i get vials to 2 and 3, killing my opponent on turn 5.
my opponent drew like garbage, five lands is not where you want to be in burn.

round 3 D T  
Game 1   
he doesn't leave up any interaction against my fetch island vial start, then dies to cavern into squid wizard, vial in nomad, kill you. He had StP in hand.

Game 2
Board out the combo,force of will, 2 daze. Board in all fifteen cards.

This one is a bit of a grind, but my answers matched up and I ended the game with true name copied by phantasmal image and nomads en-kor to infinity block.

Round 4 White Eldrazi    
Game 1  
He plays Warping Wail on my nomad then follows up with  big Thalia. then he procees to brick so i can play  karakas and my combo. dead turn 5.

Board: Get that combo out of there
Game 2
He plays thalia and rest in peace that i dont care about, wastes me a little, resolves chalice at one, then draws land for three turns. Meanwhile my board becomes true-name true- name, image copy true name, recruiter, image copy recuiter, shaman en kor. 
My hand is force, disenchant, redundant true-name, dark confidant, brainstorm, Vial.

He tells me he has no good answer to true name except for racing it, which was harder now that his deck had all that hate in it now. 
 
4-0 in matches, 8-0 in games  good enough for Jace Tms.

overall this actually wasn't good for the testing puposes I wanted, too many people drew bad. I cant really draw that many conclusions. Whatever.

Sure was fun though!

<TEXT> Yeah people really just don't look at other decks when approching the format. You're not wrong,
its just your conclusion is misleading. 

Conversion rate is what is important here, but we cant have that data for the vast majority of tournaments.

If  deck A has 5 players, and deck B has 10 players, and they both put 1 person in top 8, guess which deck was better for that tournament? 

This is what happened with BR reanimator. No one took it seriously until they saw it present a high conversion rate at eternal weekend, but the deck had no new printings and existed forever before that. 
Everything in there had been done before, even in concert with each other, but that was the first time it had been played at an event where people could say:
This deck has a high conversion rate.      </TEXT>

sorry.

BR reanimator and Aluren are two recent decks that have existed forever and with no real new cards printed have exploded in popularity, proving your point and debunking the myth that deck strength is tied inextricably to deck popularity.

Even card choices in popular decks are like this. Joe losetts deck is a rotten ham sandwich, He himself says it's suboptimal. 

People still try to play "losett miracles" until they realize its actually loser miracles and smarten up.

how fast does lilana go to take him out, how fast does she get kicked, and how fast do events unfold as above?

<TEXT> No.

$t4ks (not stax)  is a deck that originated in vintage as a way to 
solve the base blue infested meta. it has smokestack in it, but the deck was called The four thousand dollar solution.

interpose the s and the t and that gives you Stacks.

later the deck focussed more on the cards smokestack and the name changed a bit.

nowadays vintage largely has no "stax and it has been replaced with workshop aggro."

I looked at that pile of edh cards, and, while it is a prison strategy,
you dont get to call it stax if you don't have smokestack the card as
 a central part of your gameplan.

This is what happens when you culturally appropriate part of the history of another groups format. Fogeys like me get excited that you're talking about magic history and click, and then channel the ensuing disappointment into educating you on the difference between their old thing and your new thing.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> the setup:

Liliana gets blackmailed by one of her demons into betraying the gatewatch.

Teferi petitions the gatewatch to help investigate what appears to be the start of a phyrexian incursion.

upon arrival in Urborg, Jace is bitten by a zombie and necrosis sets in. under the guise of helping remove it,

Liliana takes control of him via a partial reanimation spell.

"You thought the eldrazi were a problem? You should've helped me with mine. Now you know how it feels to be on the receiving end"

"Liliana, the Betrayer" or "liliana, Breaker of Oaths"

"Jace, undead puppet(art has jace with chain veil puppet strings)"

Now with the master telepath under her control, Teferi shows up and gets mindsculpted. unable to fight temporal manipulation zombies, to say nothing of Jace, infinte telepath,  they decide to go handle liliana's chronic demon problem.

All the while, the phrexians further their machinations unchecked...



Eternal Waltz 2UUBB

(art depicts Jace and Lili dancing in the ruins of lord windgraces mansion, 
Jace with chain veil puppet strings, superimposed over screaming Teferi.

At end of turn, return to play all permenents that left play this turn.

Each player gains life equal to the amount of life lost this turn.

<TEXT> in the context of that being the advice, i should mention that in addition to the d t deck in my flair, I have  the shells for most of maverick, alluren, celaphid breakfast, manaless dredge, ant, br reanimator,
tezzerator, encantress, burn, food chain, miracles, and grixis delver (although i do not like the way miracles controls the game or the way grixis delver seems to operate. ) 

I probably also have shells for other decks im not thinking of. I tend to pick up the most wins in my meta by either playing a deck that is tier 2+ and correctly anticipating the meta that event, or playing a 
tier 1-1.5 deck and making a bunch of generally subpar card choices that turn out to be correct in the meta that i anticipate. 

My actual play skill is all over the place, dependent on what time of the day it is and what day it is. Sleep problems suck.     

the reality of the situation is that my matchup win percentage goes up here the greater variety of weird stuff i get to play, and so my goal is just to improve the size of my collection of  decks i can build here. It just so happens that  prison and awkward combo can play the most strange garbage.  </TEXT>

i dont play much standard, but i hear people compaining that its too fast and needs to slow down. turn 4 format is a term bandied about. if so, its hilarious to me that by making answers weaker and threats better, standard is turn 4, modern is turn 3, and "broken" storm combo is so bad in legacy right now only the most die hard are still on it, making legacy the slowest format on average. </TEXT>

I wouldn't mind red getting free spells in their slice of the color pie though. pyrokenisis is probably over the top, but crash, thunderclap, mogg alarm, downhill charge, flameshot,
the only awkward one is maybe cave in and that makes more sense as pitch tremor anyways. Unless you count blazing shoal.

<TEXT> this is a good point. However now we're talking about a maindeckable answer that a large enough group of decks could play to force the rest of the decks in the format to slow down and interact. This answer must handle both creature and noncreature threats, but may not have
to do so on the stack. 

For reference on how powerful this card is, thoughtseize is close to
this card but too proactive, and abrupt decay does about half of this cards job. counterspell is actually 1 mana too slow to fix our problem, while also taking a dump on anyone still not trying to kill you immediately. a force/ counterspell hybrid might do it.

Maybe.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes on account force is easier to fight with discard than pump spells.  

Id much rather give the format misdirection than force though.

Much safer than either of these are the free spells that don't remotley resemble countermagic. abolish,pyrokinesis, cave in, contagion, freaking tidal bore and orims cure can go a long way 
towards solving problems out of the sideboard.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> i just noticed how many widely played decks have key cards that happen to be trinket mage targets.   

miracles - top  
eldrazi- chalice    
storm- lions eye diamond  
death and taxes - aether vial    
lands- mox diamond    

Its almost like if you arent playing delver or midrange, you need to ask yourself why you aren't playing a trinket. 

Obviously with legacy being as diverse as it is there are some exceptions, like show and tell and reanimator, probably elves too.

I don't know if this is useful as anything other than food for thought, but it sure as heck makes why chalice is insane in this meta crystal clear if for some dumb reason it wasn't already.

Wow, I've never seen so many people misunderstand in my life.(hyperbole). my point wasn't "everyone, lets play trinket mage" that card is terrible in the majority of decks that have blue mana. my point was "In addition to all the cards people put in their decks for consistency and efficiency reasons, look at all these engine and glue pieces that also get hit by chalice at zero and one. Also tier 2+ strategies tend not to have one."

Just for future reference, how many people here know of the reference to 0-1 casting cost artifacts as trinkets?
it might help me write something like this so that i don't get chewed out because people focus on something i didn't actually type.

<TEXT> What can i do about testing for mold in my buildings hallway?

If it is there, its been there for months, and it's probably not going anywhere anytime soon. i can confirm wet spots on the floor, and i can confirm that this floor does not get cleaned often enough for what happens on it ( family down the hall doesn't properly dispose of diapers, almost always gets left in the garbage chute for at least 2 days.) 

When i complain to landlord about mess, she says she has no real control over what people do about trash and spills.

Help?

<TEXT> Actually i'm pretty sure you spun it twice.

5 minutes might be generous, I didn't really start thinking about what happened until minute 2, and i think when that game finished there were 15 minutes left in the round. 

I did however take longer than i probably should have shuffling pre-game, so whatever we'll call it even.

I refuse to believe that i figured out most of what you had in less than a minute. There's no way I'm that good. Nope. Don't believe it. Occams Razor. </TEXT>

woke up on sunday, wanted to play anything but d t, only had grixis tezz as an alternative.

leave at 9:50 to arrive for a 12:00 event. easy game right?

10:00 - go to pay for lemonade at shoppers, cashier #1 has line 8 deep, cashier#2 is in the back doing something for the 1 customer in front of me for 8 minutes. he comes back and the other line has served three people, i walk out to see my bus drive away. Hmm. 

11:30 - Miss my stop. This ones on me.HMM.

11:42 - arrive.

eta: 1 hour 20 minutes at the outside. real time: 1 hour 52 min. HMM HMM . eta needs revision. tournament starts at 12:30 instead of 12:00 cause a judge had to be shipped in.
(cue mental image of judge arriving via battletech-style dropship)

39 oldwalkers, none of this gatewatch bullcrap 6 rds top 8 (lllemonadeeee)

don't have real notes, writing from memory, already wrecked from lack of food. LEMONAD-

round  1  STORM - ANT -Togores list - player experience level : competent beginner, Storm on play.

my opponent fetches for sea and plays ponder, i waste his sea, he fetches island and plays top. i cast chalice on 1 and my opponent passes. i play sword of the meek, my opponent tops on his end step. then he goes so deep into the tank i think hes gonna drown.

stage 1 of top thinking: cool, maybe he overthinks it.
stage 2 of top thinking: cmon man we got two more games to play!

at this point i have no idea what hes on. hes played misty, misty as fetches, usea island as land, top ponder as spells. first i thought it was bug delver, otherwise he would've got island, right? nope. top. shardless dosen't play top so i put him on- get this - bug standstill.
then he tanked for over five minutes. 

stage three of top thinking: wow okay no ones this bad at resolving top, somethings up. Hes trying to figure out if he can kill me. NO ONE takes this long. 

stage four: i begin piecing together what his hand is based on what i have in play, what he does, and what his presideboard configuration must be. Turns out I'm only off by two cards.

stage five, acceptance: he stops thinking, untaps and draws, plays out LED, petal,petal. volc
and passes the turn. i proceed to dack his petal and transmute for lil rex revoker on LED.
He mini combos, but then dosent have the red mana to PIF due to the lock on LED. He dies just after that, tezz ult then 5/5 put it away.

I'm just glad i had plays during my opponents top activation.

game 2 opponent kills me through chalice. at this point i start to wonder if my opponent isnt playing 4 dark ritual or something. ability to play around chalice is disturbing...

game 3 the game progresses to the point where i have double chalice on one. my opponent has echoing truth, I have force of will, tezz puts it away with 5/5 chalices.

2-1 games 1-0 matches. cool goblin piker bro.

round 2: eldrazi stompy- player experience level: competent beginner, i'm on play.

game 1 : I play land go.  he goes mana source into mimic, i waste him. he attacks plays mana source into mimic and i waste him again. he plays mana source attack pass, i play mox diamond pitch tomb fetch land and deluge x-1, and he blanks on mana for way too long.

game 2: he surgicals all my fetchlands, needles naming wasteland, then i set up bridge and proceed to assemble thopter sword at my leisure. I really hope hes not still kicking himself.

4-1 games  2-0 matches. elvish ranger. sweet!

Round three:  Infect - player experience level: seasoned vet, hes playing first.

he starts pendelhaven into hierach, i play waste and pass, he plays inkmoth nexus and passes back. i think a moment, go to waste his nexus, he activates and uses vines. hmm.
i play waste and waste nexus on his upkeep. it works, he plays foothills. Then this beating occurs:  "play ancient tomb, chalice 1?" float blue, brainstorm, daze chalice, fetch. untap, land pass. "play land chalice 1?" spell pierce your chalice. Well crap then, pass turn. untap, brainstorm blighted agent. okay still got outs. untap, "play strix?" force of will . okay, "bridge"?  "cards in hand?" Uh oh. "One." untap draw land, attack with agent,  invigorate
into berserk. :0 

game 2 waste a wasteland on irrelavent dual, lose to inkmoth.

" There is no game you deserve to win, but plenty you deserve to lose."

4-3 in games , 2-1 in matches  Dreg reaver! take me back to the forest! DRINK MOAR LEMO

round 4 Bant with tamyo field researcher - player experince level: sesoned vet.

honestly i dont remember much of this match except that my opponent had to remind me on two seperate occasions that I actually won game one, including after game 2 when i went to pick up the match slip and sign my loss in. " We still have another game." "Wait what? "     
talked about how much i like tamyo in bant, probably better than jace in that list given that the deck wants to beat down anyways, and the meta just having more creatures in it. 
Bonus corner case: interacts with top for the purposes of counterbalance!

edit: SmellyTofu reminds me that I made the misplay of taking batterskull with dack, not realizing that it did not take control of the germ. I had not cast dack before that day, and not stolen equipment before that play. I'm told
i was salty. If someone could tell me what else happened in that match, i would very much like to know. i still don't know how i won game one.   

5 - 5 in games, 2 -2 in matches  jedit ojannen. Hmm.

round 5: D T Player experience level: On the low side, reletive to d ts necessary skill level.
he takes the play :

"Plains vial go". this could be really good or really bad depending what his two drop is. i make chalice 1 off mox diamond island, he plays mystic getting batterskull, i play tomb into
tezz - 1 turns chalice into 5/5 and attack, he vials mom, untaps plays land and passes.
i attack with tezz token and he blocks with mystic. uh oh. i play a strix, minus tezz for a 5/5
then the following turn plus that one and play another. hes seen enough.

game 2 this game went long, but i locked him with ghirapur aether grid, then toxic deluge,

thopter foundry grid, then thopter sword for a turn prior to revoker on it, he got a jitte then i had dack for vial, daretti your other vial then Gloom for the concession.

Gloom is as targeted as hate gets man. Gloom dont play.

7-5 in games 3-2 in matches. I'm No longer vanilla - now I'm COMMANDER GREVEN IL VEC

oww my spine fix it with more lemonade-

round 6 mono red aggro-comb - its burn. just burn. - player experience level : i have to assume it was his first time playing legacy, i know there was a very new burn player in the room. 
 
brutal honesty here, i deserved to lose this match. the matchup is terrible but more than that, I gave him every oppurtunity to kill me in game three. As in, i knew full well what the correct line was  3-4 turns in a row( make 6 thopters, gain 4 life ) and decided not to take it
in favor of doing something cool that i hadn't done that day yet on all those turns. I would have even lost had my opponent prioritized his targets better or drawn better.

   
4-2 in matches , 9-6 in games. there are no 9/6 creatures in magic. which means...

I'M A REAL BOY!!!

I sit down to play a fun game against one of the local miracles players( Yes I'm the nutjob who enjoys playing against miracles. Sue me.) when i hear my name for top 8.
" I what!? How the heck did that happen, and who's responsible for it!? Me? No, see i distinctly remember this game in round 6..." 


semifinals match : Wilkin Chau on... hoo boy. 

So Wilkin is a well known deadguy ale player. Iv'e seen him play other decks, but  not to good finishes. In fact, I've never seen him pilot a non deadguy deck to a successful finish in an event longer than 4 rounds. I'm not saying it hasn't happened, I'm saying when i sat down across from him with him being the number one seed in a six round event, i struggled to come up with ways that he was not on deadguy.

wilkin plays first, top8 play draw rule.

game one: wilkin mulls to 5. "Go." "uh youre on the play wilkin." "I know. Go." "I'm confused, did you chose to draw?" "No I'm on the play and i'm passing the turn."

Oh. Ohhh. Now i understand.

wilkin cast no spells that game, and conceded when he would have had to discard for hand size.

game 2: i board both glooms, aether grid, dread of night, padeem and wormcoil engine.

he goes turn 2 chandra, turn 3 koth, turn 4 three for one fiery confluence.

"I've been got." Me, 2016. I had gloom and deluge sitting in my hand.

fixed my sideboard, on to the clincher.

game three: he plays no less than ten different cards that i did not see in game 2(or 1 obviously) and i lose to fiery confluence on my everything.

9-8 in games 4/3 in matches. I AM THE EATER OF DAYSSSSSSS

all in all i had fun, could have done better in games with better play, but the guys i lost to got me pretty freaking good. really glad i didn't play d t today. daretti was one of the best cards in the deck. not much miracles in the room which is sad because i think i'm favored and i love playing against it anyways.

PRRROPPS-
-The Gentleman of the Green for lending me an ensaring bridge. You know who you are. 

-The special guest judge for having split second and awesome

-the guys at F2F for putting up with my bullcrap

SLLLOOOPPS
- the cashier for taking way too long. I could have not gotten lemonade, but then the way the day goes i don't get to eat or drink till 6:00 maybe, and i certainly play worse and am less sociable.

- the spectator who said "I think you missed your trigger " when i did nothing of the sort. I get it, call the judge, even if like in this case you just finished your judge call 15 seconds ago(no hyperbole) and you just want to get your burn game over with so you can get your food from across the street.

i do feel confident in d t, but the primary goal here isn't to win, its to enjoy playing magic. i play reasonably well with the deck, and i like it, i'm just really not feeling it right now.

i'm just thinking of how bad this is gonna be: me, to round three opponent while on tilt cause of loss;

<TEXT> i have d t built and i dont wanna play it in my monthly today.

i also have grixis tezz, with only one bridge and one transmute artifact.

I'd really rather not play d t, as while i believe i am a competent pilot, i feel ATM that my enjoyment of playing that deck is too tied up with how often i win with it. 

so do i play optimal d t and hate it, unfinished grixis tezz and win like no games, or just not play. 

i want to at least feel like there's some chance of winning my games when i sit down.

playing at face to face today, gonna get reamed by rich mattuzio, lam "always has the force" phan,   or aaron "top 8 Again??" kasprzak. 

also see the resurgence of deadguy ale, too moch pox, too much eldrazi, and then all the miracles players are also grixis players, you can only bring one deck, and they usually all bring the same one. 

always 2 ur
always 1 mud
always 2 cloudpost

usually 30 + person event, but team unified modern elsewhere. ?????? 


edit: playing tezz, would rather run crap and have fun than run the nut and present as a douche.

<TEXT> I want to point out BR reaninmator and manaless dredge both won large legacy tournaments (10+ rounds) recently, and that burn is 15th on mtg top8 for most successful decks. 

also, check out ari laxs video series on belcher. winning way too much with that thing online.

I think turbo depths did somthing huge lately too? 

D   T is obv the best of these. 

burn only costs so much cause of goblin guide, and you can build it
less controlling with no fetches and flame rift in the searing blaze slot.

I've been supporting my legacy addiction with limited twice a week + $125 a month on singles actually. only that much cause i'm trying to build dredge and grixis tezzerator at the same time.

<TEXT> i would argue that burn could be built to crush that meta fairly easily, with the caveat that miracles is miracles and would take some extra work to break even on.

also, miracles is a pain in the arse to play if you are tired or over long tournaments, especially among new arrivals to the deck. not neccesesarily because you make mistakes per se, but remembering what U/x fetch you have on top for predict is harder when you're in round 3 game 2 and you came here after work or got up super early for this thing or whatever.

death and taxes is a good beginners deck only if you watch an obscene amount of footage and take notes on your opponents opening 4 turns. otherwise, get ready to get ranched for a while as you figure out how to predict your opponents development so you can sequence your lock pieces to stop it. 

Less white weenie, more monowhite control.  Thalia/Waste is my Counter/Top! (hyperbole)

<TEXT> revoker and port against miracles, wasteland and combat creatures against delver. active jitte is a lock piece.

crusader over big thalia is probably a mistake depending on your meta, eldrazi is extremely difficult to beat without that card, now the deck is durduling with recruiter and prelate. 

understand that with the new options, your cmc is higher and now you are worse against non-blue, which matters depending on the meta you are expecting to face.  remember that there are no sacred cows, if you get wrecked by miracles and delver, play more disruptive creatures. if jund and eldrazi dump in your cereal, 
play more flyers, thalias and lieges in your 75. sometimes mangara is too slow. sometimes theres so much 
eldrazi, 4th mom makes no sense. 

Sometimes you get a meta where no one respects wasteland and you get to play 4 arbiter 4 ghost quarter 4 path. -1 stoneforge.

<TITLE> how do i set up local weekly legacy in my area </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-02 16:47:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Heyo reddit! I want to run a local legacy thing on a weekly basis. i live in a major metropolitan city, but the western half of that city dosent have any stores, nevermind legacy. the other places that have weeklys are at the far east end  or the center north. i'm far west. 

the problem is I've never really done this before and legacy players are harder to herd than a bunch of cats.

questions:

1: where do i do this? i have seating and tables for 8 people comfortably at my apartment, but it's my apartment so...  alternatively is the local mall, but im pretty sure its not open late enough. Help?

2: prize support is the easiest part,  ironically.  %100 into prize pool, done and done.
totally willing to eat a loss here in order to provide like coffee or snacks to the players or whatever.

3: lending decks and cards. Im close to finishing my second legacy deck and am a bunch of recently spiked modern cards away from two more. totally willing to lend shit, but dont know the etiquite for that. help?

4: rules enforcement: it may be a very slight exaggeration to say there are as many judges as  non- judge legacy players locally, but only a very slight exaggeration. the problems come with stuff like:
 4a: can i play the event and run the event?
 4b: can a judge play the event and judge the event if its non-sanctioned like this? 
 4c: local players wont play in this unless there is prize support. this makes the previous
 two  things maybe a little more dicey than they might be otherwise.
 
5: how do i advertise this? facebook didnt work so hot last time i sorta tried this, but obviously ill try again. what other avenues should i explore?

edit: should i just give the city to stop people assuming i live in a small town despite saying major metropolitan area? how about biggest city in the province?     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Theres basically Two directions you can go in.

the first is with the rest in peace helm win condition. these decks tend to be stronger against discard and stoneblade strategies, as well as control strategies that utilize the graveyard.
decay is a boning, and somtimes BGx also has golgari charm. 

the second is with replenish as a focal point. these decks have more resillience to countermagic and decay in exchange for having a more awkward win condition.

no enchantress list can reliably beat any form of combo deck without introducing large
amounts of dissynergy. TES, ANT, sneak show, painter stone, omni-tell, elves, belcher,
oops all spells, reanimator of the UB or BR variety.

all of these decks either go under you, interact with your first hate card then kill you,
or sidestep your hate/locks almost entirely in the case of elves. you have no turn 0 or 1 interaction.

i haven't played this vs eldrazi yet, but i cant imagine chalice plus clock is good news either.

lastly, the reason the lists are varied is because a lot of normally sacred cows get slaughtered depending on what you are expecting to see, and then certain card choices - most of them actually - inform others in the deck. for example, miracles can't function properly with suppression field in play. combined with choke, this is close to a hard lock, and pretty easy to set up with replenish, but all of this is a total nonbo with rip-helm...

if you do decide to consider playing this thing, know that miracles is by far your best matchup. their cards do not line up well at all against yours.

know also that a splash of some sort will always be more beneficial than straight GW. red offers words of war and blood moon as well as sick seal of fire tech against delver in replenish
strategies. blue gives you energy field in rest in peace builds. in the eye of chaos is pretty hit 
or miss nowadays though, but it was a house against dig through time. black offers doomwake giant in replenish builds(dont laugh) and discard out of the board. 

good luck! don't emrakul annihilate anyone i wouldn't!

<TEXT> I have read the card intuition. It does not get four spells. This is very important. Three copies of the same spell is not important. The first, when conditions are met, wins the game.

<TEXT> i figured the reason to play this over storm is that you then have 12 slots on the combo instead of 38 or whatever ANT has. consider a disruption suite of : counter top, force of will, thoughtseize with strix and bolt to buy time and brainstorm to tie it together.  the closest comparison would be sneak and show or other "slow combo" and i could be mistaken, but i think this takes up less slots than all of those. </TEXT>

<TEXT> the tendrils in main is bad because   
A: you have no way to really find it and   
B: The tendrils plan is plan D anyways.  
You're really supposed to only use it to make a grislebrand hit immediately lethal, in the case that you weren't able to find and reanimate sufficient redundant fat. It's a corner case that comes up often enough to be worth a slot in the sideboard.  
Yeah, Lowry's list needed some tuning. I also got the impression from the article he didn't want to screw around with it too much, or at least that he didn't feel comfortable doing so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not so sure a deck with this much redundancy has as much inherent consistency problems as a typical non-blue combo deck.
However, I also believe that this is less consistent than your typical
reanimator shell. I consider this to be the TES to Reanimators ANT-
not the optimal choice all the time, but a solid option if you want to
reanimate but there are too many deathrites in the room.

force is beat by protection hands and this deck, like storm, has mana such that daze can be played around sometimes. this said,
you're correct in that sometimes you just have to go for it and lose
to force. Its not like we're the only combo deck that's like that either.

lastly, you wouldn't believe the number of terrible or outdated list's of this I've seen. I'm not saying mine is perfect(there are some slightly budget manabase options, for instance) but having the right distribution is key for this list. Maybe we can compare lists.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> more goldfish results, I mean anecdotal but c'mon, why is no one playing this? 

game 11 turn 1 without protection, mull 6  
game 12 turn 1 without protection, gas for turn 2   
OR turn 2 with protection  
game 13 turn 1 without protection  
game 14 turn 2 with protection mull 6  
game 14 turn 1 with protection  
game 15 turn 2 with protection  
game 16 turn 1 with protection  
game 17 fizzle  
game 18 turn 2 without protection  
game 19 turn 2 without protection  
game 20 turn 4 without protection mull 4 (not finding lands did it here)  
 
Wheels fell of at the end a liitle. more coming. I'll stop when people tell me they 
don't care. 

edit: last goldfish block!

 game 21 turn 1 with protection  
game 22 turn 2 without protection mull 5  
game 23 turn 4 without protection mull 4  
game 24 fizzle  
game 25 turn 2 with protection  
game 26 turn 1 without protection  
game 27 no protection,  attempt on turn 2,3 and 4    
game 28 turn 3 without protection mull 5  
game 29 turn 2 without protection.   
hand plays around deathrite  
game 30 disruption on turn 1 and 2, attempt on turn 3 and 4   

Conclusion is that this deck is better than people give it credit for. At the very least
it's more explosive than regular reanimator and at least has the ability to go under the hate that is giving that deck fits right now.

<TEXT> This deck seems really good. Everything about consistency that people seem   to say about it just looks not to be the case. Ten games:  
game 1 turn 1 with protection  
game 2 turn 1 without protection, mull 5  
game 3 turn 1 with protection  
game 4 fizzle  
game 5 turn 1 without protection,  
gas for turn 2  
game 6 turn 1 without protection,  
gas for turn 2  
game 7 turn 1 with protection on the   
draw, risky if they counter ritual,  
mull 5  
game 8 turn 2 without protection  
game 9 turn 1 without protection mull 5  
game 10 turn 1 without protection, gas for turn 2  

um, that's a pretty good track record if you ask me. I'll post more but, jeez.

List if you ask.

Confinement(with two enchantresses)
helm obv(in concert with R.I.P.)
choke
city of solitude
sigil of the empty throne
These are just the things that don't tend to blank their deck. humility, grass and sphere
rek offense. then
blue splash: in the eye of chaos, energy field
black splash: doomwake giant(yes seriously)
non rest in peace: replenish 
So yeah, GW stax really. jam lock pieces and bombs until they die.

lots of grixis,
lots of miracles,
some stoneblade,
the guy who top 8 jersey with landstill (still playing it,still kicking ass),
a couple omnishow players,
a smattering of other things

I have:
enchantress(fun, but I want to start winning matches eventually)
tes(minus volcanic islands,bad in meta I'm told)
ant(minus same, bad in meta I'm told)
grixis delver(minus same)
junk rhino nic fit(minus top)
food chain  (bad in meta)
wrong half of a burn deck

high end stuff:
set of forces,2 seas ,trop, taiga, scrubland,savannah, bayou,2 wastes,2 ven cliques,

key things I'm missing: UG , UR and BR fetchlands

What the heck do i do with this? Help!   Keep in mind i live in canada and our dollar is 70% of american,
so most budget options aren't actually budget anymore. For example Flip Jace is $65 ($65!) here
