<TEXT> If you have a major or repetitive problem with a TTC employee, make sure, in addition to route number and time of day, ask them their badge number. They are supposed to provide it to you (but not their name, etc). Attach that to the complaint. If they don't make sure you mention that. I know it requires some confrontation, which many people would rather avoid, but it can help effect change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, the phrase is "utmost". Second, the drivers are *also* the regulars. Maybe they should be treated as members of the communities they work in. Not some mindless drones. Sure, there are good and bad drivers. You can't punish everyone for the actions of some poor employees, whether their conversations factor into any missed stops or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you that everyone should not be punished for other people doing their jobs properly. There are always good and bad employees. God help us if there is a "no talking" policy implemented. I would enjoy seeing drivers and other employees keep to the letter of the rule and speak to no one at all in protest. And the fact that they won't let drivers in the tunnels wear masks seems arbitrary.

I would disagree with you on the "beer after work" part, however. I think the new policy (which I don't agree with on principle) is aimed at those having a couple beers before work. Or, allegedly, that and other things during. I think the worker's union should have been involved in the process of creating the rules, rather than railing against them. Possibly they could have used the implementation of random testing as a bargaining chip at contract time. Just one union man's opinion to another. </TEXT>

<TEXT> (this turned i to kind of a negative-sounding rant, when I really just want to know if the book is worth finishing)

I'm having a hard time with this book in a way I haven't in quite a while. As in, I want to throw it out a window, but it is a library book. I probably wouldn't have jumped into it, but I'm reading it for the Hugo awards, although it was on my radar.

The content is interesting enough I want to know what happens. The biggest problem is the style, I suppose.

Locations will change but you won't notice because it isn't mentioned at all for a page or two, then you go back and realize the characters have been somewhere else for quite a while. No break in text or anything.

There's a lot of telling, and no showing (as much as you can in a novel). For example, there is a major time jump at one point and events in the intervening years are heavily referenced with Capital Letters, but not explained. I understand drawing out the mystery, but how many times can you do it without following up? 

Secondly: A lot of exposition that could have been done better in dialogue. "This character felt this way and the other one also felt like this but didn't say so". Pretty good summary of most of the central relationship, as well.

The inside references to clubs and bars and restaurants in SF are annoying. Describe the place, maybe. I just get the sense that I'm meant to be jealous the author knows all these cool places and I don't. (Actually a bit of a leap to assume their real, I guess, but that is the vibe I get from the name-dropping)

As if a knife was being pressed into my eyes, I keep reading "like". Am I reading texts from a tween girl, or a book. "Laurence was like, "You should sneak her up here..." Ugh. This happens no less than three times by page 179. If it was in character for someone in the book, okay, but it isn't.

I haven't quit a book since the third Riverworls installment (ugh), but this will be a near-run thing.

Sorry for the rant. I welcome disagreement and corrections.

<TEXT> Charles Stross' Laundry Files books have some interesting combat scenes. If you haven't read them, they look at summoning demons and a whole host of paranormal creatures through the lens of computer programming as a ritual (I'm oversimplifying, and missing the mark a bit I am sure). So you get gadgets that Q could have come up with (ie. basilisk camera, a reverse camera that uses a basilisk's glare to explosovely turn flesh to stone) for demon hunting, plus classic arcane weapons like Hands of Glory and amulets and charms.

The series itself can get dense, and it helps if your maths/comp sci part of your brain works well.

I think I got off topic and this just became a recommendation for the series. Enjoy! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Recipe recommendations - Haleem Beef </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-24 17:02:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I usually just lurk and try to learn in this sub, but I'm hoping some more experienced members can kindly offer some guidance. 

This weekend was capped by another trip to one of our [favourite Toronto restaurants](http://lahoretikkahouse.com/). In the market for something new, we ordered the haleem beef (and Hara chicken, and saag paneer and...there is no bad dish there!), and it instantly became a new favourite of mine.  

Initial research online has yielded many many recipes for haleem, and I was wondering if anyone here was familiar with making the dish, or could steer me in the direction of an authentic recipe out of the hundreds online. I know the style spreads over many areas, and has many iterations. The one we had was definitely made with shredded beef (not ground, as the menu indicates) and was almost like a thick stew.

I look forward to any advice, and to sharing hopefully successful results in the future, thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> **No One Writes to the Colonel, Gabriel Garca Mrquez**, the titular story was very good, and I'm off on the shorter ones. I've never read Mrquez, and this is meant to be an introduction/test the waters. Finding his writing very approachable and detailed, with colourful characters. Reminds me a bit of Steinbeck in that regard.

I also have bookmarks jabbed into the very early pages of **The Long Utopia, by Pratchett and Baxter**, and **The Last Continent, Terry Pratchett**. Not sure which one will take off first.

<TEXT> We have a conversation about taking Via to Ottawa/Montreal/Quebec whenever we travel there. The other options being to drive or fly. Always ends with me paraphrasing [Sterling Archer](https://youtu.be/Kq-N3_plNq8?t=6s). Let me explain:

As a quick experiment, looked up pricing vs. travel time for our Civic holiday weekend trip to Quebec City.

Via - $659 round trip, 26 hours total travel

Porter - $680 round trip, 3 hours total travel

Maybe this trip, or ourselves as travellers, aren't Via's target demographic. But let me ask you: Who is? </TEXT>

<TEXT> (This originally began as a reply to another "I'm watching Iron Fist" comment, and got lengthy...)

As I write, watching Iron Fist, Episode 12.

I think my biggest problem with Iron Fist is the lack of fighting. Or the lack of *quality* fighting. It's like the showrunners have never seen a kung fu movie. Wires and epic setting for battles would be wonderful. The fights are so boring, with so many cuts, nothing looks impressive. And it isn't like they couldn't have upped the ante a *little bit* from faceless goons. It isn't as thought they are trying to hide that Danny's powers are real (but he's *angsty* so he can't always use it, guys) so why not fire some powered up enemies at him. In *The Immortal Iron Fist*, magical warriors are a dime a dozen. More interesting than cannon fodder, at least.

[update](#s Oh god, Danny and Colleen are centering their *chi* together to hip hop. What the hell.) 

The biggest problem, in my mind, is the show's policy of "Tell, Don't Show". No one is pretending Danny doesn't actually have powers after the first reveal, throw some flashbacks in there! Not like *Arrow* levels of flashbacks, but shit. Danny talks ad nauseum about his training and K'un L'un. And Shou Lao the Undying! Hey guys! Know what's really popular on a competing network right now? Dragons! Unless they're planning a reveal where the Dragon was really inside Danny all along...Please don't let this be true.

[update, episode 13](#s Colleen and Danny are wearing matching shoes, can't unsee)

This show seems to lean more towards a CW superhero drama more than Netflix's previous forays. And it had (has?) such potential.

[update](#s By the way, in the comics, Danny's mom died defending him from a pack of wolves. Is that not better than "sucked out an airplane?") </TEXT>

Unfortunately, most people don't in my experience. On both sides of the aisle. Latch on to one or two issues and vote accordingly, despite political track records or other policies that might not be a great idea.

I've heard this used as an argument against compulsory voting, as well. Even more uninformed people at the polls, pulling the lever for whatever person shouted loudest the night before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As if anyone is going to listen to this guy now. He didn't want a vote on selling the local to Unifor, he wanted the CLC to open the union to raiding (which they did). He didn't consult the membership openly to see what everyone wanted. Kinnear was promised a payday from Unifor to bring the 113 into their arms, and since he didn't get his cushy position at the international as VP, he tried to make it happen. 

From what I understand, if 113 goes to Unifor, it nullifies the current CBA. There's no way Unifor negotiates a better deal with the TTC than what they have now. But the 'Mericans are running our union! We need to be more Canadian!

<TEXT> Last time I was on my own in the city was in a one bedroom basement apartment for 750. Which was just under 25% of my income, at the time. Hard to find that nowadays (five years later), I'll admit, but I made sure my place was within my means. At other times, with roommates and s/o's, my rent was less.

(**edit** I don't presume that my specific example will work for everyone, it's just meant as a "for-instance")

I mean, it's about priorities, I suppose. If your goals are to travel, or save up to buy a place, you sacrifice in the short term. If you want to live "The Life", with all the expenses that incurs, more power to you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read 'The Stars My Destination' last year and was pleasantly surprised by it. Almost like a loose retelling of The Count of Monte Cristo' in space. Classic sci-fi themes that weren't classic in 1956, either.

<TEXT>  I'm more excited to become 21 so that I can buy alcohol for cooking, and not drinking

It's easy to say that now. Then you've got a nice bottle of wine open for cooking purposes and it says, "How will you know what the dish will taste like if you don't taste me?" And you say, "That's not a bad point, but tell me, how'd you get in that glass?" And the wine laughs. And you laugh. Everyone is laughing. And the next thing you know things are burning and pizza is on it's way.

<TEXT> Saw the SC on sale, and figured why not. Spent a bunch of time updating/troubleshooting to get the controller working, and just now realizing how short the list of games that the controller works properly with (gets a lot shorter for a mac user). First couple tries, steam crashes. Don't know if that's a Big Picture issue or a controller one...the struggle continues. 

Long story short, I was hoping to get a controller I could plug in and play some games that looked like they would be more fun with a controller. I'm not a guy who tweaks settings and configs, or partitions things or any of the awesome stuff I see other people doing. Feels like no end in sight for the hurdles in getting it up and running.

Is the SC not for me? Should I be returning this particular piece of hardware? 

I welcome encouragement and discouragement equally, at this point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You want burgers? [Dangerous Dan's](http://www.dangerousdansdiner.com/) is an institution. Their burgers are in no way healthy, and that's a good thing. Onion rigns are great there, too. Want a more ridiculous burger? Try [Holy Chuck](http://holychuckburgers.com/) and if you take the challenge, prepare to hate yourself. For a quality hamburger in a nicer setting, try [Allen's](http://www.allens.to/). They use fresh beef and you get get your burger medium rare, if that's your thing.

Others have mentioned the AGO, and it is great. You can go skating at Nathan Phillips Square for your increasingly-more-mandatory picture in front of the Toronto sign. I'll also suggest [Casa Loma](http://casaloma.ca/), which is gorgeous and lit up nicely for the holidays. And if you are in that area, [Big Crow BBQ](http://www.roseandsonsbigcrow.com/) is one of my personal favourite places.

Enjoy your stay!

Very excited that this location didn't become a Starbucks or Rexall or pre-condo empty lot. Apparently the building owner really wanted to keep it a local business.

Obviously many things will be closed on the weekend, and I was hoping for some help sorting out what is open, possibly with an emphasis on Christmas events/attractions. But really open to any singular suggestions.

Failing all else, we'll just be wandering the city, but some specific destinations would be wonderful. Anywhere transit reaches.

<TEXT> **Stories of Your Life: and Others** by Ted Chiang

Great collection of short stories that explore concepts near and dear to fans of science fiction (first contact, the singularity) in a new way, including some not-so-sci-fi stories that are equally enthralling. 

Found unexpectedly in a second-hand store, prompting me to set down, unfinished,

**Norwegian Wood** by Haruki Murakami

Following a student in Japan in the late 60's through his life and relationships. Not a lot happening poltwise, but I don't really care because the characters and landscape is so interesting.

Should be back into it this weekend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im currently about halfway through *Stories...* (reading *Seventy Two Letters*) and I have to say I am really enjoying his work, so maybe I'm your guy.

Some of his characters sound smart, I think, because they *are* smart. Two hyper-intelligent post-humans are going to sound a bit different than the crew from Workaholics. Same goes for a genius mathematician, world-class linguist, etc.

As to the stories being uneventful, you may be right. In the case of *Understand*, you may naturally want to see how Reynolds will change the Earth, make it better, but that isn't what Chiang wants you to think about. You may want a more action-packed battle between the two of them, but that isn't the way they function anymore (I thought of the scene in *Hero* where Donnie Yen and Jet Li fight a battle in their minds before ever moving). In *Story of Your Life*, maybe we naturally want some grand conclusion to mankind's first meeting with extraterrestrials, but who's to say it will work that way? I absolutely loved his take on our first "Close Encounter". Looking at the practical problems over the fantasy. But it could absolutely be seen as boring.

On a slightly different note, I don't know if others may agree, but his writing reminds me of Borges a bit at times. I can't put my finger on why, exactly. Maybe Borges told his stories through magical realism, and Chiang tells similar stories with science fiction. I see similarities and would welcome a discussion one way or the other, if only to flesh out my own viewpoint. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suggest it to just about anyone, but John Scalzi's *Old Man's War* series is a great sci-fi read. 

The main character of the first couple books is definitely not "grey", but a lot of the overarching plot deals with whether or not humanity is doing the right thing in the way they are approaching colonization/expansion in the galaxy. I think the books hit on your other points more strongly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I read *Kraken* first, and it wasn't like many books I had read before. I very much enjoyed the discovery of a "world beneath the world" type of thing, like Gaiman's *Neverwhere*. I moved on to *Perdido Street Station*, which seemed to have a steeper learning curve to it's world, and was a little more difficult to get into. *The Scar* was my favorite of the Bas-Lag books, but I can't recall if it would help to read them in publication order, since they aren't sequels, but set in the same world (edit: the novels follow each other on a timeline, but the characters and storyline are mostly separate).

Based on this conversation, I plan to dig back into Mieville's work when I finish my current book. Reading about his books again makes me remember how much I enjoyed them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read somewhere (it was either in 'Crash' by JG Ballard or 'Rant' by Chuck Palahniuk) that the only reason roads/traffic works is because everyone just decides, as a group, to follow the same rules. Any group of people, small or large, decides to just do what they feel, it messes the whole system up. Obviously more eloquently put by the professional writer.

So when you have, for some quick examples, motorists ignoring bike lanes, cyclists ignoring stop signals, and pedestrians crossing wherever and whenever they want, it compounds the problem. Gets hard to police all these minor/major infractions effectively.

So help me if I was empowered to write tickets, this city's financial problems would be a distant memory. I'd be Oprah friggin' Winfrey, and you, and you, and you get a ticket.

Of course, I would go mad with power and start handing out tickets to people standing on the wrong side of the escalator, putting their bags on transit seats, and using sob stories to get at my pocket change.

<TEXT> Your right about common points. I see the characters in "Wind-Up Bird" and their analogues in "Norwegian Wood", even in the early pages. Confused young man, disappearing (to an isolated setting) girl, militaristic young man, amoral political man, awkward/regretful sex etc. No cat yet....

 Clearly you enjoyed his writing enough to stick with him 

There was definitely a tipping point, about 2/3 of the way in, where the book was either going out the window, or back in my knapsack. Curiosity beat frustration that day.

I do enjoy how the "magic" aspect seems to casually slide into what is otherwise a fairly normal narrative. "I climbed down the well to chill with my baseball bat as usual and wound up in this weird dream motel where shit is going *down*." </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle - Cuts, Confusion and Maybe Some Clarification? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-27 16:05:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't often post here, please forgive the format or the subject matter, which is probably well-travelled ground, from what I can tell.

So.

I recently finished The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, by Haruki Murakami, and let me tell you, it was a slog. I felt like I was fighting the book to finish it, chipping away for a few months. I first became interested in the book because of multiple posts to this sub in the recommendations thread, so I have all you lovely people to thank, r/books.

I have been reading that there were big cuts (25k words?!) made from the Japanese Hardcover to English version. I have read in a [few] (https://www.reddit.com/r/murakami/comments/2lc9jk/the_english_edition_of_windup_bird_chronicle_is/) [places](http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/authors/murakami/complete.html) about the "how and why" of the cuts, but not much about the content cut, other than that it was considered expendable by both editor and Murakami. Does anyone have any info as to the content that was removed? I suppose you would have had to read the original, original Japanese and the English. I don't know how slim those odds are.

I ask this because one of the biggest difficulties I encountered was the classic "What the Hell is the point of all this?" A lot of what was happening seemed disjointed. Much came together later, but the first two parts (which I've learned had been cut most) felt very random and, apologies to the author, boring. Toru lurches from one thing to the next with seemingly very little memory for what he was involved with before. "The cat is missing, but oh, now my wife is too. And oh look! Here's this well and a girl, and oh, to hell with that, now I'm some kind of creepy magic gigolo for affluent women." 

Before you think I hated the book, let me say there were parts that I loved: Lt Mamiya's tale was gripping and disturbing, and I loved the characters of Nutmeg and Cinnamon. 

And could someone just help me out: Did he cause, in a dream, Noboru Wataya to have a stroke in reality? Or...what?

In the end, this is probably the most challenging book I've read in some time (I tend to wallow in sci-fi, fantasy and humour) and damned if I didn't love and hate the challenge all at once. I've started on Norwegian wood. Fourty pages in and we've got 1) lost love and 2) a mysterious well, so ... familiar ground.

This post has turned out longer and different than I intended so

**TL;DR** Does anyone want to help me understand exactly what was going on in this novel?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Considering Havana over Christmas, hoping for some suggestions </TITLE>

<TEXT> We each have some days to use up before year's end, and a non-resort trip to Cuba keeps popping up. I've never been, and she's been briefly, and broke-ly. Heading down over the holidays (23-29). Haven't begun to scratch the surface on research, so I apologize for the basic questions. Just looking for some experienced opinions!

**Stay** - I see Airbnb operates in Havana, with some nice looking properties, and at this point looks like our favourite option. Are there any hotels anyone would recommend? Our budget is moderate, but willing to splurge for something nice. Is Old Havana where it's at?

**Food   Drink** - I've heard the off-resort food in Cuba isn't a great thing, but always from people who only go to resorts. Our tastes run more adventurous, typically, and the more local/authentic/delicious the better! (Unless that isn't a thing) We enjoy a drink or four in the evening, but trend towards pubs over bars/clubs.

**The Sights** - What can't we miss? Should we rent a fancy old car? Beaches? Are they decent outside of the resorts?

 Looking forward to suggestions, and sorry again for the vague/uninformed questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People turning north from the westbound O'Connor lanes (my frequent choice for travel) also need to learn how to stay in their lane. How many times do I see someone almost get sideswiped because they drift into the left lane. Brakes are hit, traffic slows.

The two eastbound left turn lanes sounds good, since the one through lane becomes a de facto left turn lane once the proper one fills up anyways.

They could save some headaches for people getting onto eastbound O'Connor by revoking the option to turn right onto Greenwood. I've almost rear ended a lot of "blinker impaired" people who hang that quick right with no warning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think Get Lucky was probably the only "pop" song on that album. A lot of complaints I heaed from the unwashed masses was that it sounded too "disco". Give Life Back to Music, Fragments of Time and Giorgio by Moroder could easily fall in to that classification. Motherboard, Contact, and Doin'it Right are more along their "we're totally freaky future robots" theme.

I agree that they changed on that album quite a bit, and I feel it was because most tracks were half a tribute to their influences. I don't see the pivot.

Strongly disagree with them ever not being world famous. If a 13-year-old kid from Canadian suburbia is playing their album in '97, they've got to be everywhere, I think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You had me hoping for a minute there. I stopped halfway through season 2. Terrible villains, cutesy references, every moment Bruce is on screen. It's a horrible show. Why can't it just be Bullock and Gordon getting in over their heads? Why'd they have to start Bruce as a tween? The Batman mythos, especially if you aren't terribly concerned about continuity, has plotlines (good ones!) for a decade's worth of shows. But they seem to want to cram everything in as quickly as possible. They should have gone the X-Files approach: Monster-of-the-week, plus season long plot that actually GOES somewhere. Useless!

I was extra disappointed when calling a campground on their list which told me I wouldn't be allowed to camp there. Turns a 20k hike into 50k and counts me out for that section. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From Hell (graphic novel, emphasis on novel) is a chore. Much more in depth than the movie, obviously. I sat down with it last year. Moore paints an excellent picture of the doctor's insanity, and his obsession with the occult but it does drag on.

I don't want to say the movie is dumbed-down. It is certainly more concise. And accessible. And enjoyable. (sorry Alan) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, a lot of people hate directly on Samberg. I think it's one of the best ensemble comedies on right now. The way the characters interact, while fairly predictable, makes for some hilarious moments.  The whole cast just kind of clicks. I can see future seasons getting tedious if they run out of plot ideas, but hopefully they'll go gracefully into syndication.

 Also, to echo sentiments brought up every time this show is discussed, Andre Bragher is the best straight man since Nick Offererman.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in Churchill last fall (for the polar bears), and found it to be a welcoming community. The train trip up was long, but most people we met, tourist and local alike, were friendly and accommodating. We now try to convince others they should make the trek, although the cost and time investment causes most people to balk at the idea.  All this exposition is to make my questions seem a little less harsh.

It's unfortunate to hear what is happening with the port and the rail line, but I honestly wouldn't know how to go about convincing the general Canadian public that this is a major issue. Until actual threats, not just perceived, threaten our "territorial Northern waters", how can Ottawa justify spending money on what will probably be a money-losing proposition? I am all for helping communities in need, but at this point, how can you revitalize the industry/economy there? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on the act.

I saw Roger Waters at the SkyDome here in Toronto a few years ago, and that show *demanded* a huge venue. Well worth the price, and the kilometre from me to the stage. Same goes for AC/DC when I saw them in the same venue. Do I get excited when a primarily acoustic act, or one without a naturally epic stage show comes into an arena? No. You wind up watching the singer and other band members on a giant screen. Boring, useless. 

For example, I have tickets to a Tragically Hip show in Toronto at the Air Canada Centre, which I think is way outsized for them (this being their potential "last go 'round", my principles take a back seat).

Everyone wants to sell more tickets, but I wish some bands/promoters would understand that there is an ideal setting for their shows. </TEXT>

Has anyone hiked up Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park? Girlfriend and I aim to hike up from Blackwoods campground this weekend via the South Ridge Trail. Doesn't seem too intense from my googling, just curious if anyone had any tips, or anything to say about the trail.

Also headed up to Cape Breton in Nova Scotia afterwards. Staying in the national park there, one night near Ingonish and a couple nights near Cheticamp. If anyone has any "must-see" trails, short or long along the Cabot Trail, suggestions are appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey everyone. Been looking forward to our brief stay for a while now. Have a few questions, if that's okay. Some state/province/city subs are more receptive than others.

Was just hoping for a little input from those who know best. We would desperately like to avoid tourist trap if possible. We just want to eat seafood and stare at the ocean from the best places possible.

We're driving in from Toronto via Montreal to Bangor to stay overnight. Then off to Acadia National Park for two nights to see puffins, whales, and to climb the local (Cadillac) mountain. On our way out, we're probably heading up highway 1 (do you call it that?) on our way to PEI.

Any suggestions for food, drink, can't-miss scenic places and all of that along our slightly-adjustable path will be welcome and appreciated!

Thanks! Can't wait! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Looking for a "beginner" canoe/portage camping trip (South/Central Ontario, southern Michigan or upstate NY) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The s/o and I started backpacking last year. We've got our gear and food prep to a point where we're comfortable for 1-2 nights with what we have on our backs. 

We want to up our game with short canoe trips and/or portaging to our sites, but neither of us have much experience in this area. So maybe shorter trips? Not requiring an expert navigator? I've looked around at some parks, but can't really gauge the "difficulty".

Any suggestions in the aforementioned areas (decent drive from Toronto, basically) would be appreciated! Places where we can rent watercraft, even better!

Super-specific, I know, but we're taking baby steps.

Thanks folks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think I've ever screwed up the nerve to comment here. Most discussions I catch are a bit over my head/specific, but opinions? Opinions I got.

For the record, I tried not to read your descriptions of the songs, since I hadn't heard two, to try and be unbiased.

**Limousine** - One thing I find makes a song epic, is choral vocals. The beginning is haunting, and makes me feel, maybe 'worried' is the best word. Unsettled. That's where my head goes when I hear a group singing like that. My example would be [Iron Maiden - Fear of the Dark (Live)](https://youtu.be/epYKVcHrVr0). Don't know if we count live songs, but that crowd give me goosebumps everywhere, everytime. Another trait they share is that slow build, erupting (at about 2:00 in both) into something much more chaotic.

**The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly** - I can't listen to this song without closing my eyes and seeing massive deserts and lone gunmen. Listen again to the choral vocals (are they called something different with no lyrics?) driving the song to it's conclusion. I guess it gives me a sense of...distance, and urgency. Gets the heart a-thumpin'. I can picture myself, hurrying across the plains on horseback, and it is very vivid. I get a similar feeling with [Rush - By-Tor and the Snow Dog](https://youtu.be/2UU62UcP_BA). That sense of seeing yourself in the Netherworld watching demons and monsters battle. I guess another aspect of an epic song is if it can transport you somewhere, physically (not literally, Lana).

**tken** - Was not expecting throat-singing today! Very cool. I think it exemplifies that same layering of sounds and echoing that makes a song give me chills. Another aspect, I think, is the foreign (to me) language. Take [Sigur Ros - Hoppipola](https://youtu.be/mZTb8WxEW78). The slow, playful opening, building to crescendo, and dropping off at the end. I almost feel, almost unfulfilled, to be honest. And I have NO idea what's going on. Maybe, then, the mystery and unknown of words you can't comprehend adds to the 'epic' value? IMHO, I could have picked any of their music to make this point.

**TL;DR** - Music that gives a sense of the unknown, or mystery. Songs that transport you, metaphysically, to another place. Whether specified by the song or not. And finally, a language barrier can enhance the idea of the unknown.

My two cents.

<TEXT> I feel like every event I go to in Toronto, or hear about secondhand, is run the same way. Admission, plus you pay for everything. The sample sizes even sound like they are smaller than usual this time. These things must make the lion's share of their profit by cramming in as many people as possible, customer experience and beer supply be damned. I've abstained from the last few summer beer festivals out of frustration, even though I found the interaction was still there, simply due to the cost. Lately, we just try and keep an eye out for actually brewery events.

On a lighter note, we spent Saturday evening at the Only for their Ottawa Tap Takeover. Sure there was less information (the staff were actually at a loss for a lot of the beers that were only on for the night), but at least the beers were available and priced better. Some great stuff was had. I think Dominion City's Earl Grey Marmalade Saison was my favourite of the night. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you make your own sauce? And how much do you put in? I'm asking because I had a friend say his best rib recipe was to basically "top up" the slow cooker with sauce. I was...skeptical, at best. Curious to know how you do it, they look great.

Here's the thing: I've never made ribs in the slow cooker, and I might never. Steamed in the oven for a few hours, and they're as tender as any place I've had them. Mostly because I like to put the sauce on just at the end, then broil/grill. Also, my s/o prefers them basically dry, but there's no accounting for taste :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sounds pretty good, with an emphasis on the animals comfort, not on viewing and interaction. Only in the last year or two have I started learning the difference between good and bad ecotourism, besides the obvious. There have been a few places I have seen with the disclaimer "If the animals don't feel like hanging out, sorry...", and I think that is very important.

Was at a rescue/sanctuary zoo in Queensland with free roaming emu, kangaroos, peacocks and what-have-you. But they made sure that it was clear on entering there were no guarantees any animal, including the koalas and monkeys, would be having a "friendly" day. Lot of kids having a cry because they didn't get to hold a koala/monkey that day. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  What's ruining the theater experience is high quality home systems, high ticket prices and the mass amount of garbage being produced in Hollywood.

I saw a director's roundtable with him and he basically says the cost has a lot to do with it. Something about the increasing prices, how it used to be entertainment for the masses because everyone could afford it. I think his insistence on old-school methods is just nostalgia. Most people won't notice. I mean, I saw the 70mm Hateful Eight, and I think I would need the versions side-by-side to tell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/dirty_rez already mentioned Cyprus Lake camping, which is excellent, and the Grotto is a little surreal.

I'd like to add our favourite trip last year was to Flowerpot Island, just off the coast near Tobermory. In a nutshell: A ferry drops you off on the island, and you can mil about with the daytrippers on the rocky beach, or on the trails. The best part is, after all the tourists leave, you are alone on the island overnight! (With anyone else camping). This gives you a great opportunity to visit the Flowerpots with no one else around before the first boats come, as well as the caves and old lighthouse site on the north side of the island.

Whether this is right for your family is up to you. Depends if you are just looking for car camping. There are only 6 campsites, no power, no water, no fires. You purify/filter water from the bay. Honestly, the campsites are such a short walk from the usual boat drop off, carrying  lot of stuff isn't difficult. However, we did have to walk to the north side (30-40min) for pick up, due to inclement weather.

All in all, a very unique experience, which we intend to repeat. Might be nice for a night or two, if you are in the area. But book in advance, mostly due to there only being 6 sites.

Any questions, feel free to ask, or check the [website](http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/amnc-nmca/on/fathomfive/activ/activ8.aspx) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't have as many problems with *Eight* as I do with other Tarantino movies. I felt overall it had better characters than *Basterds*, and less cheesy moments and better dialogue than *Django*. Probably one of my favourites by him. 

The problem with spelling out the characters' backgrounds would be ruining the mystery. Even Mannix (personal favourite) was left murky, until the right moment. I swear I was waiting until that last moment with Daisy for him to say "I ain't really the sheriff".

The other problem with having eight full on flashbacks would be the pacing. Honestly, I wish there wasn't even the flashback to the gang first arriving at Minnie's! (Let's not talk about the unnecessary narration) All those other tense speeches, one more with Channing Tatum spelling out his murderous plot would have been fine, I'm sure.

I welcome your criticisms of my criticism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But there was no mystery in Kill Bill. Everything was laid out. If you had got a backstory for each gang member, it would either be false, and necessitate another flashback later, or be true, and ruin the mystery. Either the pacing or the plot would suffer.

And, in my opinion, there *is* no relevant backstory to these characters. They're guns for hire in a gang, getting paid to free Daisy.

Started early walking about the next day, none of the bites were noticeable. Turns out my lower legs and back were covered, much like the girl at the end. Jammed into hot boots for 8 hours, my feet swelled up like balloons. After politely explaining to the hotel that we would be paying nothing, we left, cutting our vacation short.

<TITLE> An Open Letter to a Subway Bully (or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Call Strangers on Their Bullshit) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-09 04:36:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> EDIT, 24 hours later, amidst a hail of downvotes:

Nice to know how you all feel about defending people with disabilities against assholes. Carry on, /r/toronto

---

Fuck you, Subway Bully.

You must have heard, from half a car away, the blues riff singing out from your target's phone, as it had for the last three stops. Maybe you thought, "Well, it isn't that loud. But damned if I'm not going to make a statement." Maybe you truly thought that it was too loud. How can anyone know what went through your mind.

I heard it too, those soft, quiet songs. Blues guitar and harmonica colliding to make beautiful, lonely tunes. I know my mind. I thought, "Shit, I've heard that one already on this ride. Get a better shuffle," and was annoyed, but didn't look up from my book. The Listener asked of the people around him "Do you like this song? What about this one?" with eagerness. He was excited to show off his catalogue. His fellow passengers encouraged him. "It's nice," they told him, "That one sounds great."

From down the car, with me between you and him, you alerted the Listener to your feelings. "Hey, can you turn that off? We can all hear it!" The Listener, taken aback, muted his song quickly. His friend (newly made, or not? I never found out) coaxed him to turn it up ever so slightly, even quieter than before. You, Subway Bully, began gesticulating wildly. I speak no sign language and, clearly, neither do you, since I could read you signals loud and clear. "We can ALLLL hear you. Turn it off!" you mimed, gaining titters of amusement from your cohorts (they were also old enough to know better).

The Listener, now confused, chose to ignore this stranger flailing at him. Angered, you stand, walk a length closer and raise your voice, "We can all hear it, maybe you can shut it off now." 

When I told you, then, that maybe it wasn't bothering everyone else as much as you, you became angry at me! "His music is annoying" you said with disdain. "It's public transit, it should be quiet." 

I was confused. "The only thing annoying me is you shouting." You told me "Then go back to your book!" More words were exchanged, as you exited the train. With you claiming politeness, while I claimed you a dick.

My stop was next. But in those brief moments between, several people apologized to The Listener, and thanked me. I was upset. Why now, when the Bully had left? Why not then, when he needed your help? I apologized to him then, and suggested similar artists, and left, angry.

Does it really take a man like me, who hates confrontation? Who literally cannot even remember the correct, PC term for someone who is mentally handicapped? Whose library of off-colour humour should be left to a university when he dies, so vast and inappropriate it is? Does it take a man like me, then, to step between a bully and a mentally handicapped person in public? That is what really makes me angry.

In closing, Fuck You Subway Bully. Sideways, dry, and angry. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Questions about Rescue Diver course </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-07 21:58:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was thinking of getting my s/o this course for Christmas, since she has been wanting to upgrade. Since I am newer to the scene, I was hoping someone could clue me in.

I have spoken to two dive shops (both PADI certified). The first offered me a one-day DAN course (225CDN) in advance of the full rescue diver course. Is this necessary? I feel from reading online that the St. John's or equivalent first aid course serves the same purpose?

(edit: I guess the unspoken question is: are these guys just trying to get more money for a not-entirely-necessary course?)

The second shop just offers the full, multi-day course for ~500CDN. They didn't go into too much detail regarding the contents of the course.

Any info on helping her achieve this next step would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey. I was in essentially the opposite position last year. And I am still super-new, but for my two cents: 

My s/o had previous dive experience, and wanted me to join. I did my open water checkout, and wasn't terribly enthused (borderline frightened), but didn't want to dismiss it out of hand. With our certs in hand, we went on a liveaboard for 3 days of diving, me not knowing how I would come out.

Absolutely loved it. Being in the pool (and in my case a small lake) is no way to judge how you will feel about diving. The moment I got in the water and figured out how to apply my new learning in an actual environment vs. a shallow pool or murky lake, I was in forever. Complete gamechanger, getting out in the world. I was able to get over my misgivings and then some. 

Reading your other comment, she should be prepared to be tired *after* the dives for sure. We were beat after each day, barely having time/energy to eat and drink the permitted amount of beer.

Luck may have something to do with it, as well. We saw nothing but bloody parrotfish our first day, but I accepted the experience as being enough. That said, when you see a turtle or a shark come into view, it really makes it all worthwhile!

I know where she is coming from, I've been there, so please feel free to quote me, a stranger from the internet, in your drive to convince her. And good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Other people have said most of what I would say. For boiling water, a Jetboil is excellent. Or a small compact stove (for those delicious raviolis).

Better tents, and the shelter that was suggested are huge. Our first time at a music festival we made a lot of good friends just by having a shelter everyone could hide under from rain/sun.

Another thing: Choose who you go to festivals with wisely. I've been to a few, and sometimes you get a real turd in your group. If they're a dick, why have them back? Be honest about it. Don't let someone bring your good vibes down. </TEXT>

Jorge Luis Borges was a master of the form, and wrote many that sucked me right in. Just on the edge of the fantastic, and beautifully written.

<TEXT> Might be a bit of a time investment, but Robertson Davies' Deptford Trilogy might interest you. Been a few years since my last re-read, but it follows three boys growing up in rural Canada from boyhood, to manhood, to late adulthood. One of the characters, Paul, goes on just such a journey, but I think his story doesn't play out in detail until the second or third book.

One of my favourite (set of) books.

<TEXT> **Annihilation by Jeff Vandermeer**

Boring. So boring. I don't know. I saw it on /r/books and some 'best of' lists. It dragged. The narrator was almost completely unlikeable. Sometimes a story that drags on can be saved by relatable, or at least interesting characters. I just didn't care. What was the point? I know there are two more books but I have *zero* interest. I almost put it down. I almost threw it out the window or left it on the subway with a giant 'Don't Bother' sticker on it. Was there supposed to be tension building? Dread? I felt nothing! Narrator wanders through swamp seeing weird-ass stuff. Narrator reacts like robot. Nothing is revealed. Cliffhanger for the next book? Non-existent.

As fans of beer, we also bicycled to Saint Sixtus from Poperinge to sample their fine, fine beer. Very scenic. Maybe less bicycling in winter :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> When an author uses words that a character wouldn't use, usually based on their country/region (like /u/arch_maniac mentioned).

For example, in The Long Earth, Joshua uses a few British words that I don't imagine an American would say. Specific examples escape me, at the moment, but it really took me out of the story. I felt I was hearing the author(s) speak, rather than the character. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on your trade. As a painter, we pull 32/hour, nowhere near 150k. But you are dead on about the "work stability". Seasons and construction phases affect many guys, but if you are in the GTA, work is usually steady. Speaking to your other comment, -35 is a no-go for many trades, usually considered too cold to safely work. Well, if you mention that, you may risk the ire of the foreman/super/owner, but that's your choice, I suppose.

And dude, if you are sick of faking it, educate yourself where you can. </TEXT>

Unnnfortunately, we only realized this a week ago. Needless to say, second-hand becomes necessary. Looking on stubhub, the lowest I see is $130 each. Is this fairly average? Should I wait til I get into town? Looking forward to some NHL hockey!

I think the best part was waking up in the morning, with about 3 hours until the tour boats came to bring the daytrippers. We had the Flowerpots all to ourselves, snorkelling around the shore. I can't recommend this trip enough, and will probably be back next summer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a few different kinds of safety co-ordinators. The ones who are letter of the law and toss people for any infraction. The kinds that work with you to solve your problem (recommendations only, for liability). And the kind that say "Wow, that really is the only way to do that. I'll be back in 15 minutes, and you'd better be done". That usually only happens when death is not an option though :-p

<TEXT> Canadian here. Flew from Toronto for 2013. I bought a tent while over there and brought it back with me (lashed haphazardly to my backpack). Spent a week and a half in Belgium/London beforehand. Other than the obvious overpacking that was necessary, I wouldn't say there was any hardship. Packing smarter next time would eliminate some weight. Like the bare minimum of clothes, gear, etc. I left my passport and some other valuables in a lockbox in my hostel as well. Didn't want to bave that go missing.

The ticket buying was a damn hassle even then. Stayed up late, and the site continuously crashed. F5 key took a beating that night, but I secured tickets fornmyself and two friends. As others said, they sell out in moments, so be prepared to fill shit out in a hurry.

Also, the bus trip from London is shit, I would recommend finding another option if possible. </TEXT>

This has been my biggest problem with demolishing the Gardiner. These guys have a plan to replace their Viaduct with something equivalent to what is there now. A six-lane boulevard is not the same as a highway.

I do love the plans for the waterfront. Very condo/chain restaurant free for Toronto though...

I'm a little bummed about actually getting to events. We have tickets for two, but the others seem kind of inaccessible, especially for sports I am not sure I will enjoy. "...but it's in Hamilton", "...but it's in Milton". Ordinarily, I would drive there, but I may be on a rampage by the end of the drive.

<TEXT> I had trouble reading for a while. Everything I picked up I would half-finish, and leave to gather dust on my shelf. I found the problem was I was trying to read 'important' books. Don't get me wrong, I loved reading Steinbeck and Verne and Achebe, but it felt forced. 

Then I read an article, probably from this sub, about reading what you love, without feeling bad you aren't reading what other people tell you to.

So I stopped slogging through Dostoevsky and Dickens and dove into Pratchett, Tolkien, Vonnegut, and branched out from there. Just read what you actually like to read. You'll find it comes easy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting article. I moved here shortly after it came out, and this gives me a new persepctive on why things may be the way they are.

From personal experience, the neighbourhood has been trying to tidy itself up, but the "element" is still there. In addition to the blood and guts that actually make the news, several stores have been reporting break-ins and personally, my bbq was half-stolen (just the lid and the pipes, ffs) a few weeks ago. All in all, it is a fairly decent neighbourhood, with a lot of good people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely one of my favourites. One of my prized books is a complete Holmes set that I browse through at irregular intervals. Such great stories.

Out of curiosity, have you read Neil Gaiman's ["A Study in Emerald"](http://www.neilgaiman.com/mediafiles/exclusive/shortstories/emerald.pdf)? He wrote it for some anthology/tribute to Holmes, as I recall, and was later collected in one of his own anthologies. Might be an interesting read, with you having so recently finished the source material.

<TEXT> When an author changes their style, or maybe repeats themes, etc. from previous books, it frustrates me. It's hard to explain properly. 

Some examples, perhaps: 

China Mievielle had me hooked with Kraken and Perdido Street Station, but when I tried reading The City and The City? Nothing clicked. Still unfinished. 

The first two books of Philip Jose Farmer's Riverworld had me interested, but His Dark Design felt like it was just re-hashing old ground. Plus the extensive autobiography of the character with the same initials as the author...ugh.

I haven't enjoyed anything by Chuck Palahniuk since Rant. I feel like he lost something, maybe it's just me. And I loved most of what came before.


As for sci-fi/fantasy recommendations? China Mieville's Perdido Street Station and The Scar, John Scalzi's Old Man's War (haven't read the sequels yet), Warren Ellis' Transmetropolitan, if you are a graphic novel person.

Don't get discouraged! What I have learned is to just read what you like. Branching out can be fun and interesting, but you should still enjoy reading. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am lucky in that I leave for work around 5am most days. No traffic to speak of. My Golden Rule For Driving In Toronto: "Stay off all highways while the sun is up".

I agree with what /u/crankybadger said, however. You get a feel for the flow of traffic, if it is your regular commute. I could predict the QEW's ebb and flow like a mariner when I was driving to Burlington every day. And my choices in the "Lake Shore or stay on Gardiner?" riddle almost always led to victory.

<TEXT> Hello fellow Canadian. 
Let me start by saying I have links to almost none of my soup recipes from the past (thank YOU burnt out hulk of a laptop). But I intend to address your query with gusto.

Recently I tried Jamie Oliver's [tomato soup recipe](http://www.jamieshomecookingskills.com/recipe.php?title=tomato-soup-1) and it was delicious. I did wind up straining out the seeds, since I like mine smooth.

A favourite of ours around here is beef goulash. I use a slightly modified version of Tyler Florence's [recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/beef-goulash-recipe.html) with great success. I must recommend accompanying each bowl with a dollop of [kajmak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaymak) to increase the delicious tenfold.

Last spring I used a frozen hambone (from an easter ham) to make split pea soup. Neither the girlfriend or I were huge fans of the tinned variety, but homemade, as you may imagine, is world's away. This recipe is lost, but was found originally through googling 'how to make soup with ham bone' or some such thing.

We frequently make chicken soup/stock throughout the winter. We use a whole damn chicken (or just a couple saved up carcasses), plus fresh veg and cutoffs from other cooking endeavors that have been preserved in the freezer. Making chicken soup/stock, I find, is as personal a thing as you can do in the kitchen, with everyone having their own method. I started with [Mr. Oliver on this one as well](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/chicken-recipes/easy-chicken-stock), and tweaked it for my own tastes over time.

I have made gumbo both in the slow cooker and on the stovetop. The slow cooker recipe I have lost, but [this recipe](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/chicken-and-sausage-gumbo-10000000701065/) went over fairly well. You can add a shellfish element at the end, if you so desire....looking at the recipe again now, there is no okra, which I find confusing. Perhaps it is a silly recipe...

In any case, mon frere, good luck with you winter endeavors, and I will see you on the other side of the deep freeze!

ninjaedit addendum: Get yourself a proper stock pot! Don't be caught saying 'This pot I use for every damn thing is big enough!' only to have it overflow with deliciousness all over your stovetop. Your pot should big enough to comfortably wash a small child/sedate cat in! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am sure a lot of people have this conversation/argument around the dinner table, or more likely on a bar stool fairly often. I have to say I am all for it. It gives you a really fresh perspective on a song. Purists will argue that it is ruining the feel or the vibe, and that's fine, but it's all subject to your tastes. 

One problem, if you want to call it that, is when the cover becomes more popular or well-known than the original. Mannfred Mann's 'Blinded by the Light' cover of Springsteen's original is probably the biggest, best example I can think of at the moment (any other good examples?) 

In my case, as a kid I became familiar with some covers before I knew of the originals. 'Heroes' was by the Wallflowers, not Bowie. And being Canadian 'It's the End of the World...' was obviously by Great Big Sea, when did REM cover them?! As an adult I have come to love the original in the first case, but cannot bring myself to enjoy the slower, less fun original in the latter. There other examples, including a well-repressed memory of referring to Zep's Kashmir riff as 'that Puff Daddy song' that my friends never miss an opportunity to mention...

Some other great covers, imho: Johnny Cash's acoustic 'Personal Jesus', Jonathan Coulton's laid back 'Baby Got Back', Bowie doing 'Across the Universe'  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lucky man. 

Had a similar problem in NYC, and it ruined the trip. Almost all the bites were on my legs, and I didn't notice them first thing in the morning. It was winter, crammed my feet into heavy socks and boots for a day of walking around. Thought it was just my new-ish boots irritating my feet. Man, when we got back to the hotem and I took my socks off...big blisters, feet swollen...worst feeling ever. The hotel initially just offered to turn down the room. After a small (notsmall) outburst from me, which included a bare foot going on the reception desk, we wound up with a new room, laundry service (twice) and paid nothing for the three days stay. Absolute horrorshow.

TL;DR Glad to see someone managing to make lemonade out of their lemons! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am no stranger to the dual nature of Coffee Time. Growing up, it was always where the less savoury people in our neighbourhood hung out. Granted, as a youth you don't see the other people in the shop, just the "characters". The stigma was there, even in Oshawa. I guess the cheaper, less pushy style allows people to just hang out there. When I got older, I found out that their coffee was actually pretty good, and their baked goods were head and above the Tim's in the same area (might be site specific, though).

So yeah, I know Coffee Times are perceived, sometimes accurately, as shitholes. But look at what it means to an entire segment of the population in that area. It is what so many cafes would like, I am sure, to be. A rallying point, or at least a meeting point for the community. I don't think anyone will force the store out. Sadly, it will probably just end up being a case of the owner of the property seeing their ability to charge more for the space, and then it is just a matter of time until the lease expires. 

I think it is sad that these people won't have anywhere to go afterwards. And I mean voluntarily. Set up whatever social programs you want, but you won't get all these people under the same roof again.

<TEXT> Contrary to some of the other posts here, I have a cautionary tale. 2012 we had our camp ransacked. They went through coolers, tents, everything. Grabbed everything they could out of the tents, and found the rental car keys in my friends' tent. Ransacked the car, then tossed the keys (we assume) as they were making their getaway. We spent hours that night and the next morning (Monday) looking for them unsuccessfully. 

For the record, if this happens to you, you have to pay to have the car towed off the property, then pay a different tow company to take you into town, not to mention the cost of replacement keys.

Luckily, someone had found the keys. Since they were from a rental, they thought to send them back (or something) but happily left they're number with lost and found. We called them and they drove 30 minutes back too Roo to return them. Such a fucking relief, but a very scary, potentially very expensive eight hours.

My recommendation to our group this year is, if many people need access to one key, put it under the corner of a tent, near a peg. Don't think the mental giants ripping people off at Bonnaroo will think of that one. </TEXT>

Our rough plan is to roll into Brussels Monday night, then rent a car and drive to Bruges some time on Wednesday, then head back to Brussels to catch a late train on Thursday. 

No hotels have been booked yet, know any really good ones? We aren't rich by any standard, but will spring for a nice place with a glowing review :) Also, food! What's the can't miss local places to eat? Traditional? New? Trendy? Historic? I want to consume them all! And beer! Beeeeeer. I love it, she loves it even more (lucky me). Give me your breweries, your halls, and your brands!

Thanks so much for responding, and helping us getting the inside track on your beautiful country!

EDIT: Yeah, I was just looking for recommendations. Nothing fancy, just "If you are here, you must see/try *blank*." Just excited, hence the format of the post... </TEXT>
