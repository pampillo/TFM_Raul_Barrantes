<TITLE> Ran out of space on hard drive, tried to move 'Data' to a new drive, nothing shows up. PLEASE HELP! </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hey,

Recently I have ran out of space in the drive that I installed FL's 'Data' folder on, and I'm not too keen on deleting the other files I have in the same drive just to free up space when I have a second hard drive that has 2TB of free space. 
So, I thought, I should just be able to drag and drop the 'Data' folder into the new drive and FL should still look for that folder on my computer and use it to load everything. But, I did that, and for whatever reason nothing showed up in my FL; all of my projects were gone, my samples, everything. I couldn't even load the default project. 
I was wondering whether I'd have to change the destination that FL looks in for its data and tried copying everything back over to my secondary drive (I had previously copied it to here, then back to where I had installed, and it worked - everything came back up, but there was still no space) and realised that a) It was going to take an hour and 15 minutes, when copying before only took about a minute and b) There was still a 'Data' folder left over in my secondary drive which only had the 'Patches' subfolder in it.

TL;DR - Copied 'Data' folder to new drive for more space, everything (projects, samples, etc) disappeared, copied back and it worked they returned, but would still like to move my Data folder to the new drive so I can continue to download packs and save projects there etc. without destroying my Fl Studio.


Thanks in advance, I'm pretty lost here :(  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sign me the fuck up. I'm from the UK also and I am literally salivating over the promise of the next RaM episode coming out this year as we speak :)))))))) 
I have my fair share of issues too (had them for quite a while) so I imagine we're in the same boat in that regard.
I'm pretty into creative shit, about to go study graphic design, game dev, and film studies at college, and I'd like to think I was an open minded person. 
And I am hopelessly kinky to boot, so there's that. ;) 
Hit me up if I sound like your type of person and we can get to know each other!

I dont have Kik sadly, but anything else (Discord, email, snapchat, etc) is fine by me!

Looking forward to getting to know you, if you decide you want to chat :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cant. We've already been through the social services route and she has somehow managed to convince them that everything is okay, and it went right from being the risk of rehabilitation to the closing of the entire case. Nothing I say now would work as they will most likely just think I'm using my mother as an excuse to do badly at my exams. 
I say 'revenge' loosely as I really just want my mother to realise how much she is (and has) hurt me.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trying to get back at my intelligent, emotionally abusive mother. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-29 16:26:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll keep it short - for as long as I can remember, my mother has consistently emotionally abused me, but done so in a way that makes it incredibly hard to spot. She is very well spoken, has a respectable title, and is looked favorably upon by all of her peers. But behind the scenes, she has an alcohol problem which she refuses to fix, going back and forth between help services only because people tell her to, and then lying about 'getting better' only to continue her drinking. Social services have been involved and the police have had to come over on some occasions, and she has even been threatened to lose me (I am 16) but she always seems to get away with it. 
I am sick of having to deal with an abnormal and nasty human being and I have tried my very, very best to understand her side of the story, but the way she treats me and just how vastly different her behaviour is from other parents has drawn me to the edge of the line. I cant report her, as I said above, as she is very smart and does what she does in a way that makes my complaining look childish. She is incredibly manipulative, making me look like a spoilt, ungrateful child whenever we go out to meet family, being nice to me one week, and then making me feel like shit the next. Sometimes she says she's proud of me but I don't know whether that's just so I can be her trophy or whether she really means it. 
I want a way to get back at her by digging in deep. I have considered messing with her bank account but the legal repercussions have turned me off. I can only seem to inconvenience her by unplugging devices, emptying things, and 'misplacing' items, but aside from these (which are very petty) I cannot think of anything else. 
I have a toolbox with plenty of things that can help in dismantling items, and i have grown relatively nifty in swiping things when she isn't looking, if this helps. 
She says she cares, and then she tells me to slit my wrists. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. My GCSES are 4 days away, and all of this shit going on is just wearing me to the bone. It's been 8 years of this now and my patience is gone. 
Please help me get revenge on her.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> New rat owner, confused with my two little girls behavior </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-26 22:07:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all, new to the sub (and ratties in general!)

I heard about these lovely little creatures online at one time and they just seemed lovely, so recently I bought two little Siamese girlies at 6 weeks old. I've had them for a week or so, they have a comfy little cage with a hammock and old tshirts, plenty of things to crawl on, and I try my best to give them some time out of the cage every day for at least 20-30 minutes (I'm still a student so sadly I'm on a very tight schedule!) 

So far, from what I've read about rattie behaviour and telltale emotional cues, they seem to be settling in really well. One of my girls, Amy, was so curious that even only a day after I got her she was already crawling up and down my arm, exploring my shoulders, and sniffing my fingers! My other girl, Maize, is a little more shy, but I've discovered her weak spot is cheek rubs - she goes into full bliss mode, no matter what shes doing :P
I have taken them both onto my bed on a few occasions to let them get used to me and my scent, and to reassure them I am not a big scary hairless monster, but a friend, and they took to that really well - they trotted around exploring my mattress, crawling under my laundry and looking like they were having a good time; they actually both fell asleep snuggled up either just next to my cheek or under some clothes, which I found adorable!

I have a concern though. While my girls do like to sniff and lick my fingers, and in Amy's case crawl up on my shoulder and sit there or wander left to right, some of their behavior really confuses me. For example, however happy they are to sniff and lick my hand, if I make even a slight sudden move, they will freeze up and jolt backwards. Even putting my hand into the cage too fast could scare them :(. Another thing that I only discovered a few days ago was that when Amy comes to mess around on my shoulders, she sometimes stops and bruxes, and since she's moving around so much and sticking her lovely little snoot in every which way I have no idea whether its stress or contentment! 
And another thing, whenever I walk into the room, they tend to just stay absolutely still where they are and not run up to the bars like I've heard happy ratties do. They do let me pet them quite a bit though and although I have never heard bruxing, they seemed not to mind.
How long will it take for these girlies to get used to me and my hooman movements? I want them to be the happiest little ratties in the world, and I'd hate to think my picking them up for one on one time or letting Amy crawl up my shoulder and then presume she wants to stay there makes them unhappy. :(

Thanks!

*PS. I can provide pictures at request, they're a lovely pair :)* </TEXT>

for sidechaining though, I literally just used volume automation (although I am aware of other methods such as ghost notes and gross beat) just because it gave me more direct control.

<TEXT> Hey there, and thanks for the warm welcome and advice on my first post!

I just wanted to reach out to any furries up in the UK, specifically towards the North, since I've looked all over the internet and there are barely any meets or communities for us up here and it makes me sad... I need furry friends :(
If any of you are up North (or anywhere else in the UK, I'm not too bothered) I would love to chat to you and get to know one another because whilst this is such a lovely community I feel like were lurking in the shadows over here and we need to expand a little more! :)

<TEXT> Hey, 
Recently I have been incredibly interested in this community, but unlike most, I haven't been super interested in anthros pretty much at all until viewing some of the fantastic art you guys make. I really really like the atmosphere of this community, but I'm not sure that's because it makes me feel like I belong with some relatively like minded people (furries generally share common interests from what I've seen, eg games, art, Internet culture etc) or because I'm actually interested in the rest of the fandom. I'm not sure what I am classified as, as I can still really appreciate the art for what it is but I don't have this deep seeded desire to be an animal like a few others I've met seem to have. I can see the appeal of making an alternate version if yourself (I'm in the process of making my own :P) but that's about all I'm interested in save for the art and the general friendly vibe the community holds, and the feeling of being part of a lovely group of like minded people. 
If anyone could clarify, I'd be really appreciated, as I'm not too sure where to go from here :S </TEXT>

For example, I can still enjoy Overwatch without having pinpoint accuracy because of the variety of roles and tactics that I can play, and Siege looked similar in that regard; Will sound awareness outplay a well placed shot?

<TEXT> Hey all,

I thought it would be a good idea to post on this subreddit after lurking around for a while and I was thinking why not start with some of my own content. I have a YouTube channel where I upload tutorials and stuff and this is one of them. I'm not sure what the rules about self promotion here are, but I wondered, being a community of animators, you might be able to help me out on deciding what I should upload. I animate almost every day, but am struggling to find ideas for what I upload, so yeah.
Anyway, enough of the bullshit, here's a lens flare tutorial I did a while back that has a nifty little trick about blend modes and some other things that may help you guys out. 

Thanks, and please do let me know if posting stuff like this is not allowed :S

I hope you enjoy, and any feedback whatsoever is greatly appreciated.

<TEXT> Hey all, sadly to say, I've noticed that a long time favourite game of mine, Space RPG, has been removed from the Play Store, and I'm looking for a replacement.

If you could provide me with any I would be incredibly grateful :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok.. Like you could categorise the skill of players based on a completion system, and instead of like level one, two etc. it could be a Higher tier or lower tier for that league.

To clarify;

When you are playing in multiplayer, there are separate leagues (you can rename them or whatever if you like :D) and when you enter that league, you play against other players also in that league, so everyone's on the same skill level. Once you have beaten that league, you advance to the next where there will be better players, presumably now at you level, and you do the same for the next etc... If you want upgrades, just let me know and I'll have a think about how it could happen (I mean upgrades like ball upgrades etc ) 


Just brainstorming, tell me if any of this isn't possible or anything!!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> LEAGUES. I think I mentioned in an earlier comment on a different post, there needs to be a leagues feature. Too many games rely on just multiplayer and half the time just that isn't going to get people interested. I want to play a game where an advancement in your skills means an advancement in your league. Just like you did offline leagues, online leagues could be a place (or even a battleground) for users of a similar level to get credits. Message me if you're interested in logic and how to put it together, this is just an idea! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Might make a subreddit dedicated to this game, having played it for a week almost every day and having plenty of experience, as I know there's a learning curve! 


Multiplayer is a MUST for a  future update. I can really see this becoming a big thing because you could do like Leagues and things and you have to beat real players to be entered into the next league which ultimately will have harder opponents in it... Great job, OP! Absolutely love this game, bit of a grind, but once you get to the Sector League and you get tons of dosh for like two games it's a little easier...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your reply... But there doesn't seem to a be a video or series of videos that simply encapsulates the need to knows about the sport. Can you recommend anything inparticular?
I have madden and it's great fun but it's kinda hard to enjoy it to the fullest when I don't understand everything... And why not packers? XD Ps I live in the UK so I don't know many teams  Youtube probably has helpful videos to introduce you to the sport. If you play videogames, madden nfl 15 is the latest in a long standing franchise. Nfl network will have more coverage than any seasoned fan can handle. Pick a team to follow, preferably near where you live (and not the packers).

Its an extremely well covered sport with a long history so there are tons of books, documentaries, ect.

Season starts in the fall so you have a long time to prep. Good luck and go bears!
