<TEXT> Very sad, my thoughts are with those who have been affected by this. 

One small thing I want to point out if, god forbid, anyone comes across something like this:

"my next-door neighbor was the first one to try to pull the driver out. He could not do it. By that time, the fire department had arrived."

While the intentions are good, unless the car is on fire, please don't try to pull someone out of a car after an accident unless you are a medical professional. Spinal injuries can be severely worsened by improper movements. It's very likely the firefighters that responded had to use the jaws of life to take the passengers out to avoid causing more damage.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gotta be honest here, I've seen a lot of comments tonight from Fire flairs talking about how we're still the same shit team from last year and Pauno cost us the game. I feel like some of those comments are from people who only started watching us this season. Most of us can agree we're a different team from last season. Not perfect, but we're quite literally still a mostly brand new squad still working things out. We'll get there. 

I don't agree that the Accam substitution was right, would have liked him to stay in, but he wasn't why we gave up two goals tonight. We have to get better at defending set pieces. We're finally able to score goals, but holding a lead is hard when you let in two goals from two corners. 

That being said, we should have had 3 points but I'll settle for 1 over zero from that game.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it bothers me most comparing fees paid for Slimani and what Chelsea paid for Kante. Kante cost Chelsea less and he's been absolutely significant for them this season. 

Slimani is also 28 and incredibly injury prone. He's a liability at this point and not very reliable. Just my two cents.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> At least they're reimbursing the police forces that work ridiculous overtime. But jesus this bit is nearly criminal:

Around half would go to the Secret Service which provides round the clock protection for the US President, including the weekend trips to his Mar a Lago beach resort in Florida.

Agents also guard his wifeMelaniaand their son Barron at New York's Trump Tower, where they have chosen to remain until he completes his school year. 

Edit:

Not to mention this

Around $23m (17.8m) of the extra $120m(93m) would also go towards outfitting Trump Tower with necessary equipment and personnel to protect Ms Trump, as well as renting space in the building for the extra staff.

I would say most people here are not anti semitic. However, I have seen people use this sub to push their hatred against Jews. Some of these people frequently post in other subs that are purely hatred based, so it's sad to see that type of content upvoted here.

But then this is the largest issue - what is determined as the truth? Will facts and sources be easily cast off as "fake"? At what point will something be concrete enough evidence to be considered the truth? 

I think as long as the masses will consume their daily nightly news without question, no one will truly strive to be entirely honest in their reporting. </TEXT>

DD should have been taken out, he was too much of a liability towards the end. 

Would have liked Gray to come on instead of Ulloa. 

Where do we think Ulloa is going to be next season? I doubt King is going anywhere anytime soon, but do we think he'll realistically be getting much time next season? I doubt.  </TEXT>

For those that test "likely" for having Alzheimer's or Parkinson's in the future, will they see their insurance rates preemptively increase? 

Based on the amount of tests they run and results they give, I find it hard to believe $199 covers everything. Why do I get the loyalty shopper store reward card vibe from this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It actually isn't. You brought up the subject of this being scientific and a mental illness. When you search scholarly articles for transgender being a mental illness, there are quite a few that loop in being gay and bisexual as mental illnesses as well. They're pretty closely aligned in an argument like this when you start researching. 

Funny that actually searching for additional sources somehow leads to "being an instant loss in a debate"    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some people would say that being attracted to the same sex is also a mental illness. Do you agree with that notion?  

A person being transgender likely has no negative effect on your own personal life. If "normalizing" it is something that would allow them to enjoy their lives without being attacked simply for being whoever they want, I don't see the downside of it.  </TEXT>

I get what you're saying. But why should anyone's feelings dictate how a person lives their life? Chances are you'll never meet that person and they won't have any affect on your life, why the uproar?

I really wouldn't say that's too far off. The average personality of someone in r/politics is much different than your average user in r/t_d. While this obviously does not apply to all users at r/t_d, it isn't exactly a secret that some awful people use(d) that sub as a place to push their hated for different kinds of people (hence 3 if those 5 subreddits). Most of that sub is shitposting, so seeing 4chan isn't particularly surprising either.  </TEXT>

Why would you bench your top performing player when you're still fighting for top 4, and against Chelsea of all teams? Jose himself said if it's still mathematically possible to make top 4 and he plays his second team, he thinks the fans would kill him.  It just does not make sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Meanwhile, according to South Korean media, residents of the DPRK say goodbye to each other, to their homes, to their places of work, to forests and fields, to the sky, rivers, etc as if the nation prepares for a large-scale war. At the same time, it is forbidden to say goodbye to officers of law enforcement agencies. It is also strictly forbidden to mention the names of national leaders in words of farewell. 

This is strange.  

Edit:

Sorry guys, when I was looking for alternative sources I found the quote above. Didn't realize something similar wasn't in the article linked. [Here's the article I got the quote from](http://www.pravdareport.com/hotspots/conflicts/12-04-2017/137480-pyongyang_evacuation-0/). I don't know anything about this source, but it's the only other place I found writing about this.    

Second edit:

I thought I would use this to update anyone wondering wtf is going on. I don't know and a lot of media don't exactly know. The reports of people being moved from the capital may be false. **Here's what is known**:

BNO Desk - ["What did happen: Foreign journalists were told to leave the hotel before dawn for a "big event." They were not allowed take devices w/them."](https://mobile.twitter.com/BNODesk/status/852302318305517568)

[Additional source from Reuters on this](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN17E2CT)

It's noted that it does not mean it will actually be a large event (though that's not very reassuring).

<TEXT> Cozumel is likely the safest place to visit in Mexico, if you're concerned about that. The entire island is built on tourism and the government does well to ensure safety. If you want to visit Cancun for a day, you're able to take a ferry over. 

Cozumel has just about anything and everything you would want to do. You're able to walk the beaches for a few miles, there's a great downtown area full of shops and restaurants, depending on where you stay you can hop from one hotel's bar to another. The scuba/snorkeling is gorgeous. 

Every person I've ever met in Cozumel has been amazingly friendly. I've been there multiple times during the last decade and haven't felt threatened or unsafe at any point.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> At any store, unless you're paying in cash and don't use store loyalty cards, everything from what you buy or might buy to how much you spend is marketable data. Those store loyalty cards are just an easy way for customers to willingly hand over their information, all for the low cost of a small store discount here or there. Even without them, your credit card habits say a lot about you.

You honestly wouldn't believe how deep the social media targeting goes. Have an elderly mother that you visit in a nursing home? We know. Have a new teen driver in your family? We know. Just refinanced your home? We know that too. There have been very few times I wasn't able to find a target that matched what I was looking for. 

I'm happy to answer any specific questions you might have.   </TEXT>

Edit: this went from +30 to downvoted heavily within a few minutes. I feel sorry for those who lack the empathy to delay spreading images of the dead until all family has been notified. I sincerely hope none of you ever have to go through what those who were attacked, or their loved ones, are going through now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No worries. I 100% agree that using the word subscribers in that dropdown was inaccurate on Reddit's part, and the word "Reach" would have been better suited. 

And you're right, they don't explicitly say what constitutes as "recent", but calculating the last two months of unique page views + subscribers (plus or minus a few days of data since we're going to assume the number in the drop down isn't a live updating number, and the number of subscribers fluctuates) puts the number within 18k iirc. Not exact, but close.

It could be correlation and not causation, and truthfully I don't know other numbers from other subreddits to test this out (though if you knew and shared with me I'd be happy to look). The other theory that I have is that number is just created based off historical data (looking at MoM +/- in traffic and subscribers, estimating a month's expected data off of the months prior) and may not be updated more than once a month. 

I obviously don't work for Reddit so I don't have the complete answer, I'm just giving insight into how things in advertising tend to work (even though I'm being called a shill by some for sharing industry knowledge lmao). I think you and I both agree that it was definitely wrong to label the dropdown as "subscribers" since that can absolutely be misleading. I do believe that if we were actual advertisers looking for answers to our questions, they would probably be more than happy to explain how they reached that 6 million number. Most advertisers aren't stupid, so Reddit likely has actual data to back up the numbers they used in their original system. 

I'm sorry I don't have the complete answer for you, these are just ideas based on my own experience in the industry.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Technically speaking, impressions are not the same as reach. What I was describing in my original comment is reach (since that was what subscribers + recent visitors is), which is the amount of people who can possibly see the ad. Impressions are higher than reach since users can see an ad more than once. 

It seems like they're moving from reach to impressions since that's an easier number to sell to advertisers. Not exactly easy to sell though since they can't seem to get the impression numbers accurate lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think you understand how fraud in advertising works. 

Had Reddit not had the sentence "your ad will be shown to subscribers and people who have recently visited the sub", and had the same number of 6 million solely passed off as subscribers, that would be fraud. In the page explaining how the targeting works, they did not say "your ad will only be shown to subscribers" and then display the same numbers. 

Mislabeling a headline in a drop-down while still being very clear about how the number, on the same page directly above the demo image, is calculated is not fraud. Not even "one of the most basic forms of fraud out there".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does no one do even the slightest amount of research? This took two minutes to find. 

The number shown reflects who will see the ad, which is comprised of subscribers AND people who have recently visited the sub, regardless of subscribing or not. 

[It's in Reddit's advertising information](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204584279-Targeting-Subreddits)

It says "subscribers" in the drop down which is wrong and shady, because the number is reflective of subs and recent visitors. They probably could have replaced the subscribers part with something less deceiving like "Ad Reach".

Edit: Feel like an idiot that it took me so long to find this, but you can actually see the traffic patterns in the subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/about/traffic). If you take the amount of unique visitors from this month and last and combine with the amount of subscribers, you're right around the number reflected in OP's post.  </TEXT>

www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/michael-flynn-negotiating-with-intel-committees-seeks-protection-lawyer-says  

Flynns lawyer, Robert Kelner, verified that talks between Flynn and both committees are taking place

Flynn has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit, Kelner said in a statement.

<TEXT> Main points: 

- Yes, there is overwhelming evidence that backs the claim of the 1,000 people hired to do this.

- 2016 was the first time that Russia used both hacks and leaks together against a country during the country's presidential election. Previously they have affected elections of other countries with just one or the other.

- There is clear evidence right now that Russia is attempting to influence elections in Europe. 

- The last month of the US 2016 election would have looked much different had Podesta used two-factor authentication 

- Russia may not have intended for their influence to go this far, though it appears that they certainly capitalized on it. 

- As far as WikiLeaks goes, we've probably only seen 1% of emails stolen by Russia. 

This has been going on for a few hours and there is much, much more to it than this.  </TEXT>

Don't forget to check out Accam :) he's one of our longest standing players on the team and will probably be much more successful this season with a proper squad. He's on Snapchat and it's pretty hilarious sometimes. 

Might be speaking too soon, but I definitely think we have a decent chance at playoffs this year. 

For Fire info, there's a Chicago Fire app you can download or you can just follow them on social media. Emails are usually pretty decent too.

$150 is the highest I've seen for a Fire jersey in a long time. Even the kid's is $95. Usually they're no higher than $90-$100, I think.   

Also, your English is great. Don't sweat it.

<TEXT> To those asking about funding, MPHS was the hardest hit high school when [CPS froze discretionary funds](http://www.beverlyreview.net/news/community_news/article_079bb786-f2d5-11e6-9449-973f090d117a.html). MPHS lost around $211,000. 

In the past, the school had a larger budget to cover some of the expenses themselves. Almost 90% of the students come from low income families, so they aren't necessarily able to buy them on their own. 

As for why the kids "need" rings, they will likely survive without them, but it's a pretty neat thing to remember a once-in-a-lifetime achievement (for most of these kids) by.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Politics are spammed in this sub by both sides. There was a heavy influx of people following the election who were sick of the corruption. 

The "we already knew this" line is mostly used when the same article is posted 15 times over 3 days. 

This mentality is alienating users, new and old, because you *think* they're shills. No, it's not "obvious" unless they're following the same shit you seen in the politics sub. People who don't even come close to fitting in that pattern are still called shills.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's becoming a completely meaningless word now because anyone who disagrees with someone is being called a shill. 

If it's really obvious they're shilling, you can report them to the mods and they'll handle it. Plus, calling someone out directly could probably get you banned here, regardless of whether or not they actually are a shill.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People sent here to derail our conversations

I honestly can't fucking stand this thinking on this subreddit. Are there shills of some sort? Probably. But the majority of us are free-thinking people with no agenda but our own opinions. Someone disagreeing with you or tying the conversation back to *the current President of the US* if it's applicable and relevant **does not automatically make them a shill**. 

Seriously, when everyone on this subreddit has the same opinions and stops creating discussion or debate, this sub will be dead. I've seen more posts than ever before discouraging people from voicing their own opinions or ideas because "if they don't believe exactly what we believe, they're a shill".  

I was called a shill two days ago because I told someone that their argument of "autism being caused by aborted fetuses in vaccines" had absolutely zero evidence to support the claim. The shill calling is out of fucking control on this sub, and it's incredibly annoying for those who have been here well before the political shit started taking over.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2 children died and around 30 were hospitalized. It was the fault of the national health agency. A bacterial contamination during the procedure is to blame. The vaccines themselves were fine. The babies died or were hospitalized for sepsis. Symptoms all aligned with what you see in a bacterial infection. 

[Source that is slightly more informative](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2015/05/10/health/mexico-vaccine-deaths/index.html) 

From Mexico News:

Health officials believe the truth is that the vaccines were fine, but contamination by the bacteria, which was identified through blood tests, occurred at some point during the vaccination procedure.

The Hepatitis B shots were the one common vaccine among all those who became ill, but an analysis by Cofepris, the Commission for Protection Against Sanitary Risk, found there had been no other cases of adverse reactions in the application of 100,000 doses from the same batch of vaccine throughout the country since last October.

<TEXT> This is probably the most pompous comment in this thread. 

1. Not everyone has an option to work from home. 

2. Not everyone can rely on working from home or having family watch after your child so you don't have to pay for daycare.

3. Some couples genuinely cannot afford to have children. During a child's first year, provided your child is healthy and has no medical issues, it's going to cost an average of $12k. 

4. You don't have to have children to "offer something to society other than tax dollars". 

5. Those who realize they're too financially unstable to have children at the moment are being responsible and actually doing us all a favor. 

Being a mother does not give you a right to be a judgmental asshole.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our current owner is absolutely awful and one of the direct reasons for the club's downfall over nearly the last decade. There were rumors of the club being sold last season but it never amounted to anything. Honestly, with the way the club has progressed so far this season, it makes me think Andrew Hauptman is much more hands off this year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's shitty.

My coworker was roped into doing the free training session when she signed up at her new gym. My coworker, who very visibly has CP, was just looking for a way to stay active. The trainer told her virtually nothing for 30 minutes, then gave her a goal of deadlifting 200 pounds in 3 months. In her words, "I can't even hold a cup of coffee in my right hand, how the fuck am I supposed to deadlift something double my weight?" 

He then tried to charge her for 3 more training sessions. 

Some places just really suck.  </TEXT>

*Alli gets legs tangled in the box, penalty given*

"You simply can't do that, clear penalty for Alli, no doubt about it."

*Davies kicks Tadic in the knee in the box, absolutely nowhere near the ball, no penalty given*

"Well you see, the velocity at which Davies had his foot matched with the distance of which Tadic's knee was moving per second.... *Blah blah blah*... And that's why he didn't deserve a penalty".

Christ it's unbelievable with them sometimes. 

And the calls of diving from Spurs fans is hysterical.  </TEXT>

An ATL fan chewed me out saying our franchise was a joke, our team is a joke, our owner doesn't give a fuck, and our city doesn't give a fuck. Dude went off over what was me essentially saying "your team is good and will be playing a good team, good luck". 

I know it's not all ATL fans obviously, but there are some seriously fucking entitled and arrogant fans coming out. It's week 3, let's calm down.  </TEXT>

The CTA woman working the booth gave her small bag of Cheetos to the younger of the two little kids for them to share, and the look on the kids face made it seem like he just saw Santa. So excited over a bag of Cheetos.

<TEXT> I posted this in MLS but I figured some here would enjoy reading it as well. 

Chicago Fire has had a horrible problem with people using the puto chant. A few games ago, Section 8 fans and other Fire fans were actually getting into fights over using the chant. It's been getting out of hand. It's embarrassing, hurtful, and does not align with our desire to include everyone.

While the argument can be made that it's tradition for some, most of us Fire fans personally believe it has no place in MLS. Management finally made an announcement about the chant and threatening to eject fans that use it due to the nature of the chant. 

The announcement is overdue, but it's very appreciated by the fans, especially on Pride Night.

<TEXT> Most people probably know that, in the last couple years, Chicago Fire has had a horrible problem with people using the puto chant. A few games ago, Section 8 fans and other Fire fans were actually getting into fights over using the chant. It's been getting out of hand. It's embarrassing, hurtful, and does not align with our desire to include everyone.

While the argument can be made that it's tradition for some, most of us Fire fans personally believe it has no place in MLS. Tonight, management finally made an announcement about the chant and threatening to eject fans that use it due to the nature of the chant. 

The announcement is overdue, but it's very appreciated by the fans, especially on Pride Night.

Edit: /u/apocelipses [provided a great link in the comments about why the chant is offensive](http://www.outsports.com/2015/7/13/8942841/mexico-guatemala-concacaf-gold-cuo-soccer-puto-gay-slur) and I encourage everyone to read it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We knew going into the primaries that Bernie had an uphill battle to face. Throughout the primaries, time and time again, we exposed the DNC for their corruption, only to be told we were "crazy conspiracy theorists". Yet here we are, days before the convention, and the truth has finally been brought to life with evidence. 

Do not sit quietly while certain media outlets refuse to report this. Every single one of us should be outraged. Take your voices off of Reddit and let them be heard. Email your local journalists, news reporters, etc. Reach out to international news outlets. Do not sit silently. We let our voices be heard during Bernie's campaign. Continue to be heard. Keep fighting what we've been fighting since the beginning.

We can be the change in the political landscape. I am still with Bernie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was JUST on the front page.

Edit: I just asked the mods why it was removed when they said it would not be and only when it hit the front page. No response yet. 

Response: "Yes sorry about that. It was discussed and even though the revelations may be important until it actually effects Bernie or the campaign it is off-topic. Better suited for a Hillary related sub or general politics. Sorry!" 

Very confused how a document that's released that proves what Bernie has been saying about the DNC and Hillary all election is off-topic.

Edit:

<TEXT> Bernie has criss-crossed California this past month holding an absolutely astounding34 rallies, and he has the sunburns to prove it. He is going all in to win CA, and he needs our help. 

Text4Bernie is taking a YUGE challenge - contacting 1 million voters in CA by Tuesday. First and foremost, we want to make sure people know to get out and vote. We also want them to know where to find their polling locations and what to do if there's a problem. 

In the last few days, I've talked with hundreds of CA voters; ALMOST ALL of them are voting for Bernie. Some need help finding their polling place or just have general questions. CA is feeling the Bern.

Please consider starting Text4Bernie this weekend. In 1 shift you can reach a couple hundred people, and you can reach over 1,000 people a day. 

It's a self-starting process - go to textforbernie.com to get started. We have a great support network to help you through every step. 

We've come this far because of passionate people like you. Let's take this to the convention and beyond. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all,

I want to say I'm proud of everyone in this sub that has helped in any way, shape, or form. We've come so far because of dedication and passion from people like you.

It's Friday and, as we all know, Tuesday is coming up quick. This is the primary day we've been waiting all election for. We know how to win big, we've done it before. 

If you're interested in helping us win YUGE on Tuesday, we'd love all hands on deck. Here are some things you can do:

* Phonebank. We all know the importance of phonebanking. It's easy to get started and you can make a good amount of calls in just a few minutes. We would LOVE for bilingual callers. If you're currently outside of the US, you can also participate this way! You can find phonebanking events in your area at bernie.to/map or get started on your own at Berniepb.com

* Facebank. Invite your friends (and friends of friends) in states voting on Tuesday to go out and vote for Bernie. You can reach huge numbers in a few minutes. Berniefriendfinder.com

* Text4Bernie. I'm a huge advocate of Text4Bernie. You can text up to 1,000 people a day and it's incredibly quick. It's a self-starting process and we have a huge network of support for you! TextForBernie.com 

* Canvass. If you're lucky enough to be in or around a state voting on Tuesday and you'd like to go door-to-door, find a group to canvass with! Lots of people find this one of the most exciting ways to connect with other Bernie supporters. Find a canvassing event in your area at Bernie.to/map. 

* Donate. If you aren't interested in volunteering in the ways above, you have the option to donate. Make sure to use the link in the sidebar! Please remember to only donate if you live in the US. 

As always, thank you for helping us come this far. We have become so much more than just a political campaign. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm wondering if I can do anything about the creep on the blue line this morning

Edit: I took a picture of the guy as he was walking off the train so I know what he was wearing and I have a good visual of his face. I'll probably go in and try to file a report, so at least they have this on record if this fucking creep continues doing this sort of thing. He almost gave himself whiplash trying to check out two 15 year old girls walking past him, so I'm sure this isn't the first time this has happened.

Double edit: Got in touch with the Forest Park police dept. since this was at the Harlem stop. The officer heavily encouraged me to come in and file a report after I get off work so they can pull surveillance, get a report going, and see if any other complaints have been made. He was incredibly helpful and genuinely nice. Thanks for your replies and advice!  

Last edit: Just left the police station and made a report. Cops couldn't have been nicer. Don't know if it would have been the same if it was CPD, but I'd still encourage anyone to encounter something like this to report it to police. FPPD told me to straight call 911 next time I encounter something like this, so I'll pass that on to you all.  </TEXT>

We're in the homestretch and there is no better time to get involved than RIGHT NOW. Californians LOVE Bernie, we just need to make sure they know their options for voting. You can: 

* Phonebank 
* Facebank
* Text4Bernie
* Canvass
* Donate 

NPP voters that want to vote by mail have until 5/31 to request a Democratic ballot.

<TITLE> If you've got a smartphone and a little bit of free time, you can reach up to 1,000 potential Bernie supporters a day. It's incredibly effective, super easy, requires no calling, and you don't even have to wear pants to do it. Here's how. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-19 14:13:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [TextForBernie](https://www.textforbernie.com) has easily become one of the most effective ways to reach a large amount of people in a short amount of time. Here's how it works:

Do a short training and introduction. Get acquainted with the system, the lines of communication, etc. One of the best things about TextForBernie is the amazing support system from other volunteers. 

Download the app. The app allows you to easily contact the pre-loaded voter base and protects your personal information. 

Sign up for a shift. Each shift will have a different message you're sending. Everything is pre-loaded, you just have to press send. These messages are to encourage people to attend events happening near them. 

Send messages! You'll get lots of responses, either from people asking for more information, asking how else they can help, and the occasional person who asks to opt out of communications. 

So what is so great about this? California has become a priority for the campaign. Californians are jumping at any opportunity to volunteer and are incredibly receptive to messages from TextForBernie. The more that we can get Californians involved, the larger chance we have come June. Of course, there are other primaries coming up and there will be shifts focusing on those primaries as well. 


If you don't like phonebanking, you've run out of Facebanking options, live too far for canvassing, and donating isn't your thing, TextForBernie is an amazing option. I highly encourage </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The last two days I've been texting California through [Text4Bernie](www.textforbernie.com) about volunteer opportunities. Out of the hundreds of messages I've sent, I got 2 no's because they support another candidate. Only 2. 

There are older folk (65+) who are jumping to go to a phonebank event. There are college students who want to phonebank in their dorms while they take breaks from studying. There are people who want to bring their friends to rallies and show them what amazing support Bernie has. 

These are actual responses I've gotten from people. Those who can't make the event I'm texting them about are asking for other events in their area. People are offering rides to these events for other Bernie supporters. The Bern in California is unreal right now. 

It's so crucial that we get as many people in California as involved as possible. While you're phonebanking, Facebanking, canvassing, or texting, remember to ask if they're interested in volunteering. Most of the time they WILL say yes. You just have to let them know how. 

We can win California. I know we can. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the last year, more Americans are waking up to the reality of our current political system. We **can** be part of the change that desperately needs to happen. Bernie is our frontman, but he needs our support now, in the final stretch, more than ever. 

Text4Bernie is now back up and running. It's incredibly easy to use, quick, and effective. Get started at textforbernie.com. We have a great support network to help with any questions you may have while volunteering. There are loads of open positions for shifts this week! This is great if you can't Facebank, Phonebank, or donate. 

If you can donate, please consider also donating to Tim Canova. Tim is facing Debbie Wasserman Schultz for her congressional seat. Let's face it, the DNC needs a makeover. This is a great start. 

Thank you to everyone who has helped the campaign get this far. Every dollar, call, text, canvassing conversation, Facebank.and vote has made a difference. You are now part of a much larger movement. You should be proud of yourselves for helping Bernie get this far. Let's keep pushing. 

To the convention, AND BEYOND!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If phonebanking isn't your thing, you've exhausted Facebanking, and you're not in the area to canvass, what can you do?

TEXT FOR BERNIE.

I can't believe how incredibly simple it is. I sent 180+ messages in a few minutes and started getting replies almost instantly. It's handled through Hustle so your personal phone number is never given out, and the number you're sending from is a number local to where you're texting. There are volunteers on various slack channels to support you, laugh with you, and cry with you. People will respond to you with questions, comments, (a complaint here or there), so it's similar to phonebanking BUT it's great because you have more than a few seconds to respond. 

I watched the introductory webinar, went through the steps, and signed up for my first shift within an hour. Right now, I'm talking to voters on the west coast. I signed up for a shift tomorrow after work as well. 

This isn't a post to shame anyone into volunteering. This is simply to show how easy it is. If you're uncomfortable phonebanking, Facebanking is no longer an option, or you can't canvas, this is a very easy way to get involved if you want.

<TEXT> We ARE taking this to the convention. Do not listen to what news outlets are falsely reporting today about Bernie conceding. This fight is not over, nor will it be over after the convention. 

**Facts to help as talking points for IN** 

**Veterans**

* As of 2014, there were 476,283 veterans living in IN. 

* Across the US, on any given night last year, nearly 58,000 veterans were homeless. During 2012  the most recent data  about 140,000 spent at least a night at a shelter or in a housing program.

**Unemployment and Trade Agreements**

* Employees of the Carrier manufacturing plant in Indianapolis were recently told they will be laid off when their jobs are moved to Mexico. Additionally, their sister company will be moving to Mexico, taking a total of 2,100 jobs. This company made 7 billion in profit in 2015 - the CEO is paid over 14 million. 

* Since 2001, the USA has lost over 60,000 factories. Trade agreements are not helping keep jobs in America. 

* Since NAFTA, Hoosiers have lost 113,000 manufacturing jobs. 

* Bernie has opposed EVERY trade agreement that has lead to these effects. HRC has supported almost every trade agreement. 

**Living Wages**

* Minimum wage in IN is $7.25/hr - not a livable wage. Minimum wage should be raised to $15/hr. 

**Childhood Poverty**

* Over 330,000 kids are living in poverty in IN. That's over 21% of the children living in the state. 

* The childhood poverty rate in Indianapolis is over 30%. 

* 16,000 public school kids in IN were homeless during the 2012-2013 school year. 

**Young Generations**

* Young generations now have a larger chance of having a lower standard of living than their parents. To some, the American Dream is dead. Bernie wants to expand the middle class of the country and keep the American Dream alive. 

* We live in a competitive global economy. It's important that Americans receive the education they need WITHOUT graduating in thousands of dollars of debt. Americans should not be punished for receiving an education. 

**Drug Reform**

* Reform our drug policies. De-criminalize marijuana and end the war on drugs. 

* Substance abuse and drug abuse are not criminal issues, they're health issues. 

**Native American Rights**

* 18,462 Hoosiers reported Native American as their only race

Here's what we have immediately coming up ahead. 

**May 3rd - Indiana OPEN Primary (83 delegates)**

If you will be 18 by November 8, 2016, you can vote in the primaries!

This is a winnable state. We are close. If you're interested in volunteering, there are quite a few options: 

**In the area? Face-to-face conversations are your thing?**

 Two Bernie canvassing events are happening this weekend. These links also contain information regarding carpooling.
Saturday, April 30th - https://go.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/gpgfmp
Sunday, May 1st - https://go.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/gpgfzm

Interested in showing support? [Bernie is speaking in West Lafayette, IN](https://go.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/rally/gpg34k) and [in Bloomington, IN at IU](https://go.berniesanders.com/page/event/detail/rally/gpg347). The West Lafayette event is out of tickets, but you can ask around to see what kind of overflow there may be showing support outside. 

**Outside of the area?**

We know how crucial phonebanking has been to our campagin. It's fun, easy, and effective. 

[Texts for Bernie] (https://www.textforbernie.com/) is a great tool to use. Not only does it serve as a reminder for the primary, it allows people to ask questions they may have about voting locations, hours, etc. 

Facebanking is great for those in IN and outside (depending on how large your social network is!). It's incredibly easy to use and takes a couple minutes. 

Donating - anything and everything donated is important. 

**What else can we do?**

There's a Facebook page called Hoosiers for Bernie Sanders (about 6k likes) that provides up to date and important information about the efforts currently happening. See what issues are being talked about most - what hits home for IN? 

Have more ideas specific to the primary in IN? Ideas on the best talking points that will be most effective in IN to use in elevator pitches? We can do this. </TEXT>

We are all tired of election fraud. We are all tired of corruption. It is only all the more reason to keep fighting with Bernie.

If Bernie sweeps today, take the day off tomorrow (if you need it) and get right back at it on Thursday. If Bernie ties or loses by close margins, take the day off tomorrow (if you need it) and pick it back up on Thursday. 

Forget CTR trolls. If CTR is proof of anything, it's that the HRC campaign and her millionaire donors are SCARED. They have good reason to be. We can't make this an easy win for her like she wants.

Bernie will not give up - through every primary, every suspicion of election fraud, every moment of blackout in MSM, we need to be there with Bernie. 

Bernie wasn't supposed to make it this far. He has because of people like you. Do not give up. We're fighting a good fight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The neighbor's daughter made the headlines this weekend.

"27 Year Old Woman Shot in Head at Party"

Saturday morning around 6:30AM, we woke up to pounding, screaming, and crying. Assuming our neighbor had been locked out for the 3rd time this month, we tried to go back to sleep. The sound of sobbing echoed through the walls and we started to wonder if something else was wrong. 

After the 15 minute mark, we decided to call the police. When the dispatcher asked what the emergency was, I tried to explain how our neighbors are a quiet family, how it's unusual for this kind of behavior from them. When the call ended, we were staring out the window facing the alley, trying to follow the sound. 

Our neighbor, an older woman who's always the first to smile and say hello to you, is in the back of the house. We've found the source. She's screaming "my baby" between sobs. The rest of her family is piling into their car. Silence. The car pulls away.

The police arrive 2 minutes too late. We explained that we weren't sure what was happening, but thought a wellness check was in order. We said the family had just left, so there's probably no one there to answer their door. They said to call back if we hear anything else and wished us a good morning. 

We left Saturday morning and returned Saturday night. The block was lined with cars. Now we knew something awful happened. We're greeted by friends and family of the neighbors. When we ask, "how are you?", they respond with "our niece was murdered" and "they lost their baby girl". They tell us that she was shot in the head, that it very briefly made the news, and that Chicago was stupid. That people need to put the guns down. We let them know that we're right upstairs if they ever need anything, and we let them have their peace. 

Sunday morning is filled with more crying. There's screaming, arguing, "don't ever talk to me like that again". Emotions I can't even begin to understand. It carries on throughout the day. 

We run into the neighbor Sunday night, who says "I'm happy I caught you guys, I wanted to talk to you". He says he's sorry in advance, because there's going to be a lot of people coming in and out in the next few days. He tells us his daughter was murdered. His face says that it hasn't fully hit him yet. 

We let him know we're available for anything they need, and he apologises for making it a sentimental moment. A man whose daughter was just murdered is apologizing to us.

This is what's behind the "2 dead over weekend from gun violence" headlines. We read the headlines and carry on with our day. On the other side of that story, there's a broken family crying through all hours of the night. There are friends who feel they can't do anything more than say "I'm sorry".

There is more to this story that I can't quite fill in. This is only secondhand.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been to every home game in S8 this season. I've heard S8 supporters actively rally against racism and homophobia. Game after game, S8 supporters are always there after the game to show the players our support. Last night hurt to be at. The puto screaming fans that were so loud you could hear it on the TV broadcast. We're a better club than that. Some S8 supporters stuck around after the game for Accam and Johnson. Some people actually booed Accam when he walked over. This is not our club. 

I'm at a loss. Who is actually going to the game Wednesday? They're running another Groupon so I'm assuming itll be similar to last night. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I tried asking last Wednesday in this sub after a run-in how you guys deal with creeps at the gym, but it came out crepes. 

Wednesdays are my leg day and I fucking love leg day. But for the last few weeks on Wednesdays, I've been running (at all different times of the day!) into this guy who has gotten progressively creepier. It started off with him complimenting my squats, asking if I was in a contest and saying that he would have run over and spot me after seeing the amount I was putting up IF I WAS A GUY, but was afraid of doing that for a girl because "people call the cops over that sort of thing". I took the contest part as a compliment and just went on with the rest of my routine. 

After that, it seemed like if he saw me at the squat rack on any Wednesday, he would just wait right behind me until I was done just to say one thing to me. I once went over to the weight section that only goes up to 60lbs to do some lunges since the normal section (across the gym) was way too full. He walked all the way over, made it seem like he was looking for something, looked up at me and commented about how much weight I was using. Just walked away after that.

Last week, I was squatting and he took the smith next to the squat rack I was on. Started chatting me up as I was racking plates, saying things like "quit messing around, just put two plates on already". I was happy to be done squatting because I thought he would just leave me the fuck alone already, but when I went to the machines HE USED EVERY FUCKING MACHINE THAT WAS BEHIND THE MACHINE I WAS USING. HALF OF THEM DIDN'T EVEN FIT INTO WHAT HE WAS WORKING ON THAT DAY. EVERY FUCKING TIME I MOVED TO A NEW MACHINE, SO DID HE. 

I don't want to come across as someone overly paranoid, but this is weird right? Like, you guys would be weirded out if someone did this to you at the gym? I'm sitting here in gym clothes ready to squat 215 newborn bears and I'm just dreading going for fear of running into this guy.  </TEXT>

Either these people are just trying to get more traffic to their blog, or they're digging for more emails. I have NO problem with people who link to their blog at the end of a post that's actually helpful. I'm just sick of seeing these spammy posts all over this subreddit. There's quite a few on the front page right now.

r/Startups has a rule that I think would be great in this sub: "If you are submitting your own blog content, the full body of the content must be included in the post, properly formatted for reddit. A link to the original blog post is allowed. One exception: you are allowed to make a (lengthy!) summary of the post if your content is longer than 2000 characters." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The more I think about this, the more it absolutely disgusts me. 

About a week ago, my niece got into her mother's makeup and gave herself thick, black eyebrows with eye shadow. It was hilarious and adorable, but she said something along the lines of "I just wanted to be pretty". Fast forward to Sunday. I'm talking to my niece and she says something about being pretty, and proceeds to say, "if you're pretty everyone loves you. No one will love you if you're not pretty. I have to be pretty so everyone will love me". I asked her who told her that and she said it was her grandpa, which is 100% believable because he has apparently told her this garbage before. My niece's mother has already talked to her dad/my niece's grandpa about this in the past (more than a few months ago) and apparently he hasn't stopped because it has just gotten worse.

I just got this email:
"We have verified your identity information. Your Amazon Payments account has now been activated.
Please be aware that this verification does not affect any remaining verification that must be completed, such as bank account, credit card or email verifications.
Thank you for using Amazon Payments.
- The Amazon Payments Team"

followed by this email: 

"Thank you for registering with Amazon Payments and Mechanical Turk. We appreciate your interest in our product. 
Unfortunately, at this time, we are not able to approve your request for an Amazon Payments account. 
You have a current MTurk earnings balance of $26.13, which will be automatically disbursed to your Payments account once all of your submitted HITs have been approved or rejected. This process can take up to 30 days to complete. Once your earnings have been transferred to your Payments account, please initiate an immediate withdrawal of your funds. Once your funds have been withdrawn, your account will be blocked. While we appreciate your interest, the blocking of your account is a permanent action. 
Please feel free to write to us for any questions that you may have."

What the fuck? Surely if they can verify my bank information to let me withdraw my mturk money, they can verify the rest of my fucking information, right? Has anyone else gotten this sort of response?


**Edit2:**

Tried to log into Mturk, was greeted by this:

"Your request was not completed successfully.

This account has been suspended by the Amazon Mechanical Turk team."

What the fuck is going on?

**Edit3**:

I called and asked why, if everything was now verified on my Payments account, is my Mturk account now suspended entirely. I was told that my Payments account "looks in golden condition to Mturk" and that the rep I was talking to would add notes to my file and send an email to Mturk saying that everything with Payments checks out. I was then told if Mturk decided to completely get rid of my account, I would also lose my Payments account and would have to completely start everything over. If I wanted to Mturk again and get another Payments account, I'd have to use a new email address. I have zero access to my Mturk account (other than being greeted by the message above) so I can't see what my current balance is or how many HITs are still pending/rejected. I have full access to my Payments account now though after everything with my bank was verified.  </TEXT>

I have NO problem with people who link to their blog at the end of a post that's actually helpful. I'm just sick of seeing these spammy posts all over this subreddit. There's quite a few on the front page right now.

<TEXT> I've been offered a job starting in January at a startup that will officially launch their product in January. It's a general digital marketing position, I was given the choice between hourly or salary. Estimated 32-38k salary (he added about 20/hr) with equity potential and a definite raise in year two. I'm going to be fresh out of college and we're Chicago based. 

I personally think 38k is too low and would like to negotiate to the lower 40s, but have no experience doing so. Anyone have advice? Personal experiences?

<TEXT> I ordered a few things from WhiskeyInkandLace for my boyfriend and was excited when the tracking link confirmed it was delivered. Checked the porch - no package. Asked the downstairs neighbors - no package. USPS said they delivered it to the right place so I had to assume it was stolen off the porch before I could get to it. I was super bummed but left a 5 star review on the sellers page saying that even though my bf couldn't use the products because the package was stolen, the seller was super helpful when I was first placing the order and had really quick shipping. Within five minutes of writing that review, the seller messaged me and offered to replace the order this week. I'm so thankful (and so is my boyfriend!) for great sellers like her. 

Stores like that really make the Etsy community great. Just wanted to share because I'm so blown away by how great they are and how they handled it even though they weren't at fault in the slightest. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel like I'm going in circles. I'm looking into selling the homemade fudge that I make from my grandma's recipe. Originally I thought I could sell in small shops in my area, but (understandably) each shop is requiring a food license. I looked into the Illinois Cottage Food Law to sell at farmers markets and saw that the closest thing to fudge that falls under that law is baked candy (though fudge is technically not baked).

Ive begun looking into the idea of shared kitchens along with the licenses and permits that are needed, but honestly this is so out of my budget. People have been suggesting that I start by selling online, though I don't know the legality of selling something like that through sites like Etsy. 

Anyone have any experience with this sort of thing? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Batman Goodies Giveaway!  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-29 19:19:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all, 

Because there seemed to be an interest (if upvotes count) in the [Batman outlet plate](http://www.reddit.com/r/batman/comments/17do2v/thought_you_guys_might_like_this_order_i_just/) I posted yesterday, I decided to do a giveaway of a couple things I make for my Etsy shop, ComicBookCollages. The first item is an 8x10 Batman comic book collage similar to [this](http://imgur.com/FZuwx51) that will be made to order. The second includes a Batman outlet plate similar to the one above, as well as a Batman light switch plate similar to [this](https://img3.etsystatic.com/016/0/7543924/il_570xN.414359167_o10w.jpg). 

The winners will be chosen completely at random and ~~the only entry fee is your soul~~ you just need to enter by commenting below saying that you're interested in participating, and which item(s) you'd like to win. After the winners are chosen, I'll make the items and ship to the addresses given to me by the 2 winners. I cannot afford international shipping, so US only. :( Sorry. 

TL;DR: Free Batman stuff. Group A: 8x10 Batman collage. Group B: Batman outlet cover and light switch plate. One winner per group. Winners will be picked at random on Thursday. 

Questions? Comments? Concerns?

**EDIT:** The winners have been randomly selected by the Internet gods. The winner of group A is **LazerMcBlazer** and the winner of group B is **ProfChaos712**. Thanks to everyone who took an interest! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Where to send physical donations to victims of the hurricane? (X-post from r/assistance) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-01 16:36:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi fellow Redditors. 

After Joplin was devastated by a tornado quite some time ago, I ran a large donation drive and was able to send 7 boxes of canned goods, household cleaners and necessities, etc, down to a donation distribution area in Joplin. 

I would love to do the same thing for the victims of Hurricane Sandy who need the most assistance right now. The problem is that I have no idea where to start. I can't find any information yet as to where to send physical donations nor to information regarding the hardest hit areas. 

Anyone have suggestions for where to send the donations, towns and distribution areas in them? It would be great to collaborate with a couple Redditors who are experiencing this first hand so we can really figure out what we need to send. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [OFFER] Coupons for free Auntie Anne's Pretzels </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-08 05:10:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello fellow redditors! I recently came into possession of 3 coupons that entitle the owner to a free pretzel at Auntie Anne's and 3 fifty cents off a purchase coupons. I have no use for these as I am going away to school and there isn't an Auntie Anne's location close by. So I figure someone on Random Kindness could use some free/discounted food. I'll give one free coupon and one 50 cents off coupon to 3 people, if that sentence makes sense. Not sure if there are international locations, but if someone outside the US is interested I'll see what I can do. 

EDIT: As of right meow I have 2 of each coupon left!

EDIT: I'm out of coupons! It's possible that I may come into possession of a few more, in which case I may make another thread.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Request] Anyone care to create a simple logo? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-06-26 05:38:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I need a logo for my company Gamer Decor. Think of it as ThinkGeek meets HomeGoods meets Etsy. (Video game themed home decor sold online) I'm just starting it up and haven't been successful in creating a logo I like after trying for 3 days. I'm hoping for the website to be up soon, within the next month or so. 

For the logo, I'd like simplicity. Just the words and an image depicting something that symbolizes the company name but please stray things like Xbox controllers/symbols, etc. I'm a fan of ThinkGeek's logo (www.thinkgeek.com)

For the payment: This is where I feel pretty douchey. I'm a 19 year old college student that can't afford to actually pay someone with money. I can, however, provide the artist with 2 $10 gift cards to Steak and Shake (I'm a vegetarian -__-, but I can ship them to wherever) or 50% off an item when my website is actually up and running. (We can work that out via email, PM, whatever works for you)

Thank you (:
