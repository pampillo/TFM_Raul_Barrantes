<TEXT> Is there anyone in this country that thinks Comey has been competent in the last year and a half? Dems hated him when he investigated Clinton, Republicans hated him for not recommending charges, dems hated him again when he re-opened the investigation into the emails, and now they suddenly think he's doing a great job because he's part of a trump investigation. The hypocrisy is hilarious </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was a slash to the glove. Goes uncalled in literally every hockey game. This one just happened to be devastating. If there was no injury there wouldn't even be a thread. You're upset with the result not the act. Every single nhl rostered player has made a slash exactly like this, and they just didn't happen to lop off a finger. It wasn't exceptionally hard compared to typical slashes. Pretty ordinary. Probably caught right where there's no padding though and that's what happens. Nhl should punish glove slashes more consistently if anything, this goes to show what can happen </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nothing wrong with "millionaires" collecting social security. A guy that worked next to me as an engineer that retired last year was certainly never more than middle class but saved very responsibly over decades and was able to retire with a 1.5mil. This isn't some hedge fund manager, it's just a run of the mill engineer that was responsible with his savings. He shouldn't be denied social security for being responsible imo. I do understand why people would be upset at someone with tens or hundreds of millions collecting though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting. Thanks for taking the time to respond. The TurboTax forecast app shows me owing the same amount despite my IRA contribution being 0 or 5500 if I have the "does your employer provide a retirement plan" checked "yes". If I check "no", then the 5500 ira contribution does decrease what I owe. So it makes it seem like the fact that I'm provided a plan at work (that I don't use) eliminates the tax benefit of the 5500 contribution to the IRA. Very confusing to me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a retirement plan available at work but don't use it for reasons I won't specify. I have a traditional IRA account with TD Ameritrade. Right now I contribute about $600 a week to my TD brokerage account. Is there any tax benefit or good reason to contribute the max per year to the IRA?  Does it make capital gains non taxable or something? The same goes for my wife, except she does use her 401k for work and has a TD traditional IRA. Should she also contribute to that fund for any tax purposes?  </TEXT>

I contribute to my taxable account about $600 per week. What I'd a good ETF to just set and forget? I'm looking at VOO, SCHX, VTI, QQQ (in a smaller chunk since it is so heavily weighted in technology sector). Any ideas, recommendations, or criticisms of my plan?

<TEXT> I don't have a retirement plan at my current job. I have a rollover IRA account at TD Ameritrade. I want to contribute the max yearly amount to a traditional IRA (which I think is $5500?). How do I go about doing this, and is my rollover IRA the same thing as a traditional IRA? Basically I'm asking is do I just deposit the funds from my bank that were direct deposited there from my work into the TD IRA? Or do I have to have HR at my work set up a direct deposit to the IRA account? And also do I need a separate "traditional" IRA account set up for this or will the rollover suffice? </TEXT>

We could have afforded more, but it is extremely wise to live below your means. You really never know when you could lose your job, it can happen to anyone at any time.

<TEXT> This is one of my issues. I haven't really decided one way or the other (go ahead and crucify me all you want), but I do believe that some scientists have an agenda, in both directions. And I do believe that you're much more likely to lose your funding as a researcher if you say you don't believe humans are causing climate change. My other issue is the models... They were inaccurate when an inconvenient truth came out, and lots of the claims from that movie haven't come true, even the ones they said would happen within ten years. So why would I believe them now? Not looking for a debate, just information. Just genuine observations from someone on the fence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did they change the trigger in any way from the old 91350 configuration to the new 91351 with the updated threads? Or have they changed the trigger in any way during its release so far? It's one of the few drawbacks I see posted about the scorpion. I might buy one (91350) for a good deal tomorrow but am curious about the trigger, and if it has evolved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm planning on doing a booking somewhere for 3 nights the first week of January. We like great views of mountains, forests, nature, and nice restaurants on the hotel/Resort or nearby would also be a big plus. I've been digging around on TripAdvisor without much luck. Maybe winter is just a bad time for this type of trip? I don't expect we'll venture outside the resort for hiking or any activities like that, probably just drive around and see the sights. Mountain views are really king. Budget would be $450/night max probably, but I am flexible. 

Does anyone know of a good resort in this area? Or maybe another area in Tennessee I haven't considered? Forgive me if I'm missing some pertinent information I've tried to follow the sticky instructions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree about his chances in four years but time will tell. In addition, trump is still projected to win the popular vote (though admittedly he still may not). I'm not totally for electoral college but I don't think popular vote is really a better option. I don't know what the best solution is, but I have to imagine it's somewhere between the two. Also third party candidates played a much bigger role this year than in the 2012 election.  </TEXT>

For some reason the NFL and its fans go way crazier about it that other pro leaguers.

<TEXT> 1. Mainstream media collusion with HRC, proven by wikileaks with multiple MSM journalists allowing HRC campaign to selectively edit articles about them. That's not journalism, it's propaganda. 
2. DNC collusion to make HRC victor in democratic primaries. The DNC chair even had to resign... And was promptly hired by HRC campaign. And her replacement is now under fire for feeding debate questions to HRC from CNN, tying back to #1.

So there's two right off the bat without even thinking. I'd love to hear defenses for these. 

Edit: forgot another one! 
3. HRC campaign paying instigators at trump rallies to start fights.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Am I the only one sick of this aspect of presidential campaigning politics? You shred each other to hell in primaries (and that's on both sides of the aisle) then pretend like you totally support the person that wins the nom. So glad God Emperor has called out how ridiculous it is, quoting Michelle Obamas comments on Hillary and Bernie comments on Hillary. Just shows that they're either lying during the primaries, or lying during their support of the nomination winner (they are). Bernie is such a ridiculous cuck giving his support to the bullies that basically stole his lunch money and rigged the election out of his hands. If he had any dignity he would take a stand instead of pretending to support the Clinton cartel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My 20 year old Bryant heat pump went out this past Sunday. It was an R22 heat pump. My air handler also has a tag on it that says R22, along with all the other info associated with the air handler (carrier brand). My question is does it matter to the air handler what refrigerant the heat pump use? If I upgrade my heat pump do I also need to get a new air handler? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife and I are planning on buying a house for 214500 and putting 20% down in fishers Indiana. Our lender have us a FTH rate of 3.875%. I know my sister recently got a much lower rate elsewhere and I'm concerned with proceeding with this rate, as I really don't know what is considered good or bad. The credit score being used is 702. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hourly worker, weekly pay tax question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-10 15:10:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I work at an hourly job that pays me $35 an hour. A couple weeks ago I only worked 8 hours and was paid $230 after all taxes were taken out. Last week I worked 40 hours and made $994 after my taxes were removed. So essentially my take home pay was $28.75 an hour when I worked less,  and $24.85 an hour when I worked more. Going back through my pay stubs it seems that my weekly tax% removed is higher for more hours worked. Why is this? Is it because to tax weekly they are assuming that that week's pay amount will be uniform for the whole year,  and base the tax bracket off that? 

Thanks for the help </TEXT>

<TITLE> Indiana resident with Indiana LTCH </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-21 01:40:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm an Indiana resident with an Indiana LTCH. I'm confused by Michigan's "resident permits only" policy. Does this mean that only Michigan CPL holders can carry a concealed weapon,  or does it mean that my Indiana resident LTCH is valid, because it is not a non-resident permit (i.e. Someone from South Carolina with an Indiana non-resident LTCH)? I'm heading to Michigan this weekend and wanted to carry my pistol on the trip. 

Follow up question: if you are a passenger in a vehicle that is stopped in Michigan do you have to duty to inform as well? In Indiana we don't have those laws so I'm unfamiliar. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I just moved from one suburb of Indy to another and now I have a temporary DL (I still have the one from my previous address too,  for whatever reason they didn't take it). Can I privately sell a gun to another individual while I don't have my renewed license? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Currently my license and LTCH list my parents address, however I moved into an apartment. If I notify of a change of address for my LTCH do I also need to update my drivers license? Can I not just claim my parents house as my "permanent residence?" and keep both ltch and license listing that address? I hate to go through all the changes when I intend to move again in a year. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Mid back sensation for weeks.. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-23 21:38:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm new to this sub, but this feeling I'm having is driving me crazy. To preface, I lift weights, and do lifts that can cause back injury when done improperly (squats, deadlifts, bent over rows, even bench press because I arch my back pretty hard). 

About six or seven weeks ago I started having this weird feeling in my mid back, right about where the lumbar region meets the thoracic region. It's like my muscles on either side of my spine are stuck in flexion. Like someone is "poking" me, just mildly pressing their finger into my back and keeping it there. Kind of like it's being compressed. It's really hard to describe I guess. It's not painful. And I can't recall when it started, it's not like most injuries you hear about where you feel it immediately and know you've screwed up bad. But it's causing me a lot of psychological stress, and it keeps me up at night. It seems to be worse when sitting or laying down, not so noticeable standing.

I've stopped doing the lifts mentioned above about a week ago, and only do lifts that do not put any pressure on my low/mid back (not that I'm certain it's a lifting injury, maybe posture related?). I've also been doing leg and lumbar stretches every day. The problem persists. I've seen a chiropractor a couple times who doesn't think it's anything, and gave me the straight leg test to rule out a hernia (again, I feel no pain, just constant discomfort).

My mind is running wild about what it might be, causing me more stress. I am seeing an orthopedic non invasive spine doctor in three weeks, which is the soonest appointment I could get, which I'm guessing will be followed by an MRI. I've also scheduled a massage with the chiro's on staff masseuse for next week also.

Has anyone seen or experienced anything like this? I'm getting scared because of how long it's been. </TEXT>

Hello,
I just bought a used road bike (2005 specialized s-works aerotec e5) and I'm not sure how to adjust the handlebars (if possible) or remove the seatpost. Both are pictured in the gallery. I'm only familiar with cheap mountain bikes, and these components are new to me. Am I missing something obvious? </TEXT>
