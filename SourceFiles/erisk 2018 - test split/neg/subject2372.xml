<TITLE> Back up generator? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-25 14:56:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I live in the UK and I'm moving onto a canal boat in the next few months. I'm in the process of designing an off grid solar system for it at the moment. I've noticed that a lot of inverters have an auto start system for back up generators when the battery levels get too low. 

As the weather in the UK doesn't tend to be too great in the winter I'm probably going to need a back up generator sometimes but I'm having trouble finding a small generator which would be compatible with this auto-start feature. I'm only ever going to need between 1-2kw but all the generators I can find in this range are recoil start. Can anyone recommend a back up generator with auto start functionality in this power range? </TEXT>

<TEXT> of the people in the year above me at my school that graduated last July (over 100) only a handful have managed to find placements. Also the job sites pretty consistently have at least twice as many part 2 vacancies whenever I look at them, regardless of the time of year. 

Obviously I would prefer to work in an architecture practice, I'm just trying to be realistic and prepare for the worst eventuality so that I can move onto my part 2 as quickly as possible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> according to the website: " 'Qualified professional' will be an architect registered in the territory where the experience is being undertaken, or a chartered or similarly qualified member of an appropriate professional body" 12 months do have to be under the supervision of an architect but you can also do 12 months under another qualified professional in the construction industry if it proves difficult finding a placement with an architect. Thinking about it more now labouring wouldnt count as there wouldn't be a chartered professional that could supervise you but other suggestions in this thread could work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to switch schools for my part 2 for several reasons. All the schools I want to switch to are pretty insistent about part 1 experience. I'm just trying to be realistic and look for a backup plan because the part 1 vacancies are consistently sparse. There's usually plenty of people looking for part 2's but the part 1 vacancies are much harder to come by. My dad is a retired civil engineer though so maybe some of his old contacts might be able to help find something more fitting than general labouring. </TEXT>

<TEXT> there was actually an interesting exchange a couple weeks back where James was talking about that misreported story that there would be no dual citizenship in France for Jews if le Pen wins. Someone called up to correct loads of misconceptions James had about the timeline relating to Arab countries banning Jews from visiting. The thing I like about him is as soon as the facts were pointed out he put his hands up and admitted he was wrong then praised the caller for the quality of his contribution. Not many media figures would do that nowadays. </TEXT>

<TEXT> the Speaker has only said that he won't invite Trump to address Westminster Hall because that's the venue he has power over. 

The only people in recent memory that have addressed Westminster hall are the Queen, Nelson Mandela, Pope Benedict, Obama and Aung San Suu Kyi. It's considered a great honour and isn't offered lightly. I don't think many people would say Trump belongs on that list. If the speaker says he's not inviting him then it's not happening. 

He could still possibly be invited to address a different venue in parliament but it's unlikely with the way things are going at the moment. </TEXT>

I was just wondering what scope there would be to move into the industry as an entry level environment designer/3D modeler after I graduate. I have extensive experience in several 3D modeling applications (Rhino, 3DS Max, Sketchup) and the Adobe suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign) as well as informal experience in Unreal engine from playing around with it in my spare time. Do you think game studio's would be open to an Architecture graduate if I put together a portfolio to demonstrate more game specific skills? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone, I just bought and worked my way through the Arduino starter kit and would like to work it into a project I'm working on at university. Still a bit of a newbie so was hoping I could get some opinions on the best way to go about what I want to do.

Our theme for the year is architecture and politics so to kick it off I want to make a map of the council wards of Brighton out of translucent acrylic, lit from the back with RBG LED's. I want to make it so that when you flick a switch the LED's change colour to represent the controlling political party of the different areas from the 2010 to the 2015 election results.

Here's an image of the colour changes I'm aiming to achieve:

And would these lights be a good choice for this project:

<TEXT> I think the reference holds up actually. Aping a style that has passed usually doesn't work, it just ends up feeling very artificial. Case in point, the newly built town of Poundbury here in England. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG_xsFARAVg

Prince Charles holds very similar views to what you're describing and his 30+ year vanity project has been building this weird little town that is desperately trying to go back to some ideal that the Prince holds in his mind of a Better Time. The problem is it just doesn't work, the time has passed and as you can see in the video it just hasn't been very popular and not many people live there. I visited the place recently and it just feels like a weird theme park. It looks like the buildings are made of stone but its mostly just concrete with a thin tiled veneer on top. Incorporating old styles into a modern aesthetic? I have no problem with that, but just copying doesn't work imo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your response,

Having had a look at the application procedure I do have a few more questions. I see you have to apply right off the bat with a topic and hypothesis for your thesis. Is this completely nailed down or is it a more fluid arrangement, evolving as you do further research? On a related note, do you have to select a particular location to focus on from the get go or does this also evolve with your work?

I've drummed up some ideas after looking at the criteria for acceptable thesis proposals that I wouldn't mind firing off an ex-student. Could you give me your opinion on a couple if I dm you the broad strokes? Also maybe some advice on the kind of sample work they're looking for from your portfolio? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm interested in applying as I hear its more focused on written work than most Part 2 courses. However, I would be interested in hearing current/former students opinions how well rounded they feel the course is. How well do you feel it prepared you for the working world? Although I really enjoy writing, my main hesitation is that with the commitment to write four 5,000 word essays and a 15,000 word thesis that there would be less time to develop the practical skills necessary in working life after I graduate. Do the other aspects of the course successfully balance it out? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just did a search on here and the only posts I could find were a little out of date. Can anyone recommend some stuff that's a little more recent? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm interested in applying as I hear its heavily writing based, which I enjoy and is my strong suit, but would be interested in hearing former students opinions how well rounded the course is. How well did you feel it prepared you for the working world? My main hesitation is that with the greatly above average commitment to write four 5,000 word essays and a 15,000 word thesis that there would be less time to build the practical skills necessary in working life after I graduate. Do the other aspects of the course balance it out? </TEXT>
