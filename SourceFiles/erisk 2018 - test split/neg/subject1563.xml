Yeah but I said 'What CL team right now if they did not have a manager would not want Wenger if he was free?'

  I don't think any of the biggest Champions League clubs would take him now after so long without consistently winning trophies with Arsenal.

I think most people are well aware of his skillsets and his philosophy in spending. Utd dominated for years, now the money clubs are in. Yet he's still consistent, entertaining, and admired. They would take him. </TEXT>

Your argument against an intruder does not really hold up. Prob tried the shutter, was noisy, then just walked inside. There you go.

They prob were not checking every 15 minutes, that is exactly right, but it would take a min for it to happen. Didn't the father think after that the abductor might have been in the room when he looked in?

But I don't care what anyone says, her looks did help it a lot (not saying because she was a woman, a handsome man would do the same, but the world is how it is unfortunately) but then the following 2 were unimpressive.

She tried to be a bit more experimental but then that showed her real limitations. Now it seems like back to more of the same. I'll library it but I'd be hard pushed to spend money on her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This should not be encouraged on any level. Even charity shops should be boycotted. Most authors make so little from their work the idea that it should be received for free or for minuscule amounts does not bode well for authors or books in general.

While this project may be culturally valuable in certain less fortunate areas adopting it as a widespread phenomenon would be a negative for writing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If there are places like this on a large scale which are offering nothing in terms of compensation to writers like most libraries then instead of buying the authors book you just pick it up in a place like this for free.

So the author loses out. And if this becomes a large scale process most authors, who earn incredibly small amounts of cash from their work, will lose out even more.

Most people don't know how much a author gets from a book.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's obviously smart enough to make his own decisions. 

Nothing stopping him doing some art house pics for every big film.

If talking about anxiety, how he even tried to act in the first place I don't know. When I read about people using it to conquer their nerves I laugh. Get in front of people? How about get out the front door?

It is hard to feel that sorry for someone who seemed to get success very quickly when others either as actors or sufferers of anxiety and depression get nothing.

The actors because of luck I imagine, he's not in anyway special, and would be quite replaceable by other actors waiting in hollywood now. This is not DeNiro.

The others, because they can barely get out the door because they are too afraid and don't have the money for private therapists or even meds.

By any standards he was successful as an actor very quickly, and I am pretty confident he was making good money, far more than all of the actors I know.

How much do you need so? Why not go on stage and do 3 plays a year in Pasadena. He could have.

The reactions on here I cannot understand for the most part. 

Crying over the emotional health of middling talent millionaires is bizarre.  </TEXT>

Popular entertainer using his connection with the fans to get their money to protect his 'vision'. Cause he's fucking Kubrick. 

Cause he didn't have enough money of his own. And had to get some A List star. And pay his brother and himself. Or at least get the funding so they can get paid after the film starts earning. What risk.

Wonder how much he makes in the end? I would love if they came out and showed proof.

Fucking joke if I ever saw one. Anyone who invested should be ashamed. If they had any respect they should go out and invest the same in another project, one they find interesting that doesn't have the hack from scrubs involved.  </TEXT>

If they were coming up now and had the same exposure to the speed of the game and the fitness levels who can tell. One would imagine they would be great again, but perhaps they were better suited to a certain time and way of playing.

<TEXT>  Most recently, I've seen people who have done a quarter of what I've done in the industry get my dream job and now they're set for life.

Many people will dismiss this if they read it but I absolutely agree. This happens to me all the time. People with 1/10th the talent and ability and hard work ethic walking - FUCKING WALKING - into positions I would excel at.

I use the anger though, the frustration, it makes me want to succeed even more - PETTY? So fucking what?

I don't know if this helps, it did for me. But maybe think about it. Channel the negative into this.

Good luck </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have no information that states the individual or any has tried to make changes to the sub. If you have some please provide it.

 If you think drawing attention to this subs flaws is a bad thing, you're sadly mistaken. Especially with a subject such as depression.

Where did I do this? Please answer promptly as you have now smeared my name on here.

All I said was if it was done in a different way it would not have attracted the attention of the bad element that has been causing the problems in the first place.

 shouldn't have had to ask the mods in the first place

Subreddits change over time, many people may not have seen a problem. 

 I think if you are any representation to the way this sub is run, someone like OP should have made a thread a long time ago.

Would you please explain that comment in terms of the words I have used on this sub. If you cannot an apology would be acceptable.

 edit : and roaming downvote brigades. But as long as the select few feel special. I'll be subscribing for sure now.

I don't understand what this means. Who is feeling special? You are subscribing for what reasons exactly?

<TEXT> Such a simplistic way of looking at it which completely ignores my point.

I never once mentioned freedom of speech, I said I cannot support the hate speech that is contained (depending on legal matters of your country) within.

Your simplistic fob off of my legitimate concern and the foolish reaction from the users on here is deeply worrying.

You who support the books or the film are making money for someone who is a well known public figure who espouses hatred (may incite or become a figurehead, especially for the young) and a high profile member of a church which if you are caught engaging in same sex acts results in a [trial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciplinary_council).

<TEXT>  You guys trashing on Sinister are never gonna make it in this business with that kind of attitude.

Could you explain this to me? What exactly is wrong with some people on a screenwriting sub voicing an opinion? 

So you are not allowed to be critical on here? Because I know a lot of users who are, including the one below who agrees with you.

 You need to get a handle on your personal insecurities and realize everyone is out there trying to do their best work.

Presumed insecurities - ad hominem and unnecessary. 

Trying to do their best work is enough, once you are successful? That is what I am getting from here. Because that script wasn't some masterpiece. Where is the defence coming from? If a user posted it anon many of you would be trashing it.

And the users on here know that this is right. Many of the same people who are upvoted this comment would be trashing it. You undoubtedly would make a sarcastic comment about none of us knowing how the industry works, and that we are all outsiders and that.

Because none of us can actually read scripts at all. We're just that dumb. And we can't make up our minds at all. Cause we are just that stupid. 

What are the point of these posts where you just dismiss others because you have found yourself in a position of work? 

And yes, I think many of us would love to see your work, since you seem so determined to undermine the rest of us and our stupid opinions.

<TEXT> **Incaprettamento**

This is a rare form of homicidal ligature strangulation used by the Italian Mafia. One end of the rope is tied like a noose around the victims neck the other end secures the victims ankles, so that they are connected to each other. 

Victims can avoid constriction around their neck or asphyxiation if they keep their legs in a flexed position. However, when they tire they can no longer maintain the legs in the flexed position, the legs relax and the airway becomes constricted. This was meant to torment their victims and act as a warning to others. 

A case series of 18 cases of incaprettamento were reviewed to determine whether the binding of the body happened before or after death, interestingly, they found that death by strangulation occurred before incaprettamento (the victim was strangled and the body was bound post mortem). 

Am J Forensic Med Pathol. 1998 Mar;19(1):87-92.

Typical homicide ritual of the Italian Mafia (incaprettamento)

<TEXT>  Read spent only 13 months outside prison between the ages of 20 and 38, having been convicted of crimes including armed robbery, firearm offences, assault, arson, impersonating a police officer and kidnapping

 . Around this time, Read had a fellow inmate cut both of his (Read's) ears off in order to be able to leave H division temporarily

 Read was ambushed and stabbed by members of his own gang in a sneak attack when they felt that his plan to cripple every other inmate in the entire division and win the gang war in one fell swoop was going too far. Another theory is that James "Jimmy" Loughnan, a longtime friend of Read, with Patrick "Blue" Barnes, wished to benefit from a contract put on Read's head by the Painters' and Dockers' Union. Read lost several feet of intestine in the attack.

  At the time Read was serving a 16 and a half-year sentence after attacking a judge in an effort to get Loughnan released from prison.[5]

If you actually examined the data you will see a different story.

<TEXT> If I was to be honest here:

* I want to get published.

* I want to sell.

If I didn't sell, I would not get published more than once, maybe twice in the current atmosphere? 

(From what I read the long term support of those authors who were of genuine literary talent but took a while to build the readership is gone. 

Read a few interviews with some of these (Irving, DeLillo, think Franzen mentioned a few recently) who have openly said they do not think their first novel would be published today or that they would have been able to continue without certain supports from publishers - a terrible loss for literature in my opinion.)

* Writing to write.

I don't think that is me. I write literary fiction. It is somewhat experimental. It is time consuming. I am still I think a few years (2 at most come on Schindy) from having something that will work. Think B.S. Johnson. Well, maybe that is not a good thing considering how it ended for him.

I have other interests in the visual arts but they are just as financially unsound, yet I enjoy painting far more than writing. I just think I am a better writer than a painter, or need to get certain ideas out which come across better through prose.

I don't know what that really makes me. A child or two worlds, or maybe three, but in the end still only a child. </TEXT>

Modern writers living, Banville, Amis at his peak, DeLillo is criminally underrated as a stylist, Will Self definitely there.

Everytime I pick up a Julian Barnes or an Ian McEwan or a Jhumpa Lahiri and read of the 'spellbinding beauty' or 'stunning poetry' of their prose I think what am I doing. I should write a novel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a pure hivemind bizz about it, like there is about a lot of very average stuff on here. Breaking Bad is one of them. me and the gf had to give it about 4 chances and still we were giving up on some seasons.

There is loads of while not essentially plot holes (with a team of writers and loads of money they should not exist) but very stupid scenes which I thought were lazy. And to be honest most of the show is forgettable.

The characters were really not that great, walter is good sure, yeah, but the rest? Saul bugs me, he seems totally out of place, no wonder his show is going to be a comedy.

The hate to love aspect of skyler that is touted whenever I bring her up does not hide the fact that she is a dismal character, a dumbass and completely immoral. Her arc is baffling.

Jesse, essentially you hit the nail on the head. How he is not already in prison after the parties he used to throw.

Walter defeating cartel people (I know not directly) and local hoods and chicken man etc, there is only so much advantage being a high school teacher can give you.

Can't remember one snappy line of dialogue form the whole thing either. By now, we have forced ourselves through up till an episode or two ago, can't remember, just want to get it over and done with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I need to speak up against using these two freaks. There are plenty of other writers who make a good living - many are actually writing award winning literary fiction too! shock horror - those rare weird top 10 writers who are worth hundreds of millions should never be used as an example. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is possibly the worst time ever in the history of journalism to be a journalist. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either deluded or a charlatan. 

  go out and make the connections, do the networking, put in the time, and start at the bottom

Sounds so far from actual writing that you would be better served going into a position where you can utilise your writing but are not termed a writer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Irrelevant. For various reasons. Little Miss Sunshine was as patronisingly obvious a film as I can recall in recent years. Why would you want that? And whatever the studio decides happens will happen. What he writes will be rewritten and pulverised into some unrecognisable thing by the end of it.

This is a possibly a 2 billion dollar movie after games/toys are thrown in. You think it is going to be saved by the power of the writing from the same guy who wrote that irritating indie flick? Not a chance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's reddit. Simple answer. Just because it is called /r/literature means nothing. The same 10 writers are brought up everytime. The mods do an absolutely shit job on here, they are known to be some of the most arrogant on reddit. I don't know how many are actually on. Think it is alt accounts.

 We need a new literature sub. Books is quite general but this one is a joke. You can't have a discussion or a question asked without a fucking designated paragraph. Nothing worse than an arrogant mod system. Nothing. Admins should step in and remove them.

And if they have any balls they will leave this comment stand and not ban me.

<TEXT> Okay, the term great is overused, but for what it is it is quite exemplary as a film. To accomplish that on the budget and on 16mm is pretty amazing.

As for the arguments about complexity, it is as tricky a film to get on the first go that I know of. So yes it can stand with that for me.

I will add that if I was to be quite serious about the use of the term great I would say it is misplaced about 99% of the time.

Overcompensation? Well you can only review what is in front of you. 

My annoyance is that it has become a standard reference point for anyone who needs to sound smart and recommend a difficult scifi movie to watch.

It has become one of those films that every TDK Nolan sucker throws out when pressured. 

I enjoy the fact it has a place on here, there are not enough interesting movies on this sub -let us all be honest now, the size of it has essentially rendered it a comic book movie site - so films like this should be endorsed, and sometimes, to get a point across to crowds you have to be very loud. </TEXT>

I countered with another writers opinion, and my assertion that he is a far superior writer than the posted one, therefore I am more likely to listen to him.

Perfectly acceptable.

<TEXT> Because they are rich, often have access to funding that most of us will only dream about and are unaccountable with what they would with the money they raise.

 If people could actually fathom how much money and other attributes go into film making they'd be astonished and how fucked up it is to make film in a major studio film.

No one has ever tried to fund a major film, yet, but raising money for a film on it has little to do with a studio. You are free to use the money to make a film, then sell it on, making more money for yourself as your fans bleed.

Anyone who does it who is in the position of not needing, I will never watch anything they do. Anyone who contributes to making millionaires even richer for their art - we are not talking about Tarkovsky or Bergman, we are talking about relatively stupid throwaway work - is an idiot.

I wonder if Dredd 2 put up one how many retards would support it?

The world is fucked up. 

And before tries to argue I have heard it all before.  </TEXT>

That was 35 minutes ago. It is written up above. I have not altered the comment as you can see from the lack of the edit symbol.

So there is no nope, not there. It is quite clearly there. Are you blind?

<TEXT> There seems to be an entrenched minority on this subreddit that actually is not that impressed with The Nolan Batman and Christopher Nolan in general.

I found the first one boring, the second an enjoyable action film and the third an absolute bore.

I liked Following for what it was, Memento was well made and fairly original at the time, Insomina is actually quite a dull film in mu opinion.

The Prestige on rewatching falls apart to me. Looks great, but not much else.

Inception was an action film, but the praise it gets is overblown. It is nothing special. 

The sub treats him like he is some sort of Kubrick clone. There are far more important directors (we don't have to talk about arthouse film even) making films right now, far more talented, far more interesting.

I see little difference between him and Snyder or Michael Bay.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Penguin and Random House are merely digitizing successful print titles

Which they paid for, edited, shipped and promoted? 

These companies are effectively copyright exploitation factories now

That's a bit drastic isn't it?

 hoping that authors won't wake up to how easy it is to write a book, hire an editor and self-publish.

Most authors are aware of this. Some decide to do it. Others decide not to. From my lurking on here it seems suited to very specific types of books.

<TEXT> History shows that many great writers never had a break and suffered in obscurity until old age or after death.

In terms of genre fiction it is probably 99% luck. Literary or non fiction I would imagine there are elements of talent involved which do not apply to other works.

Hard work is necessary for most. Not all, there are people who have one in a million chances, we saw one post recently. Sometimes things fall into peoples laps. That is just how it is. 

It is the bad actor who makes millions when there are hundreds better than him versus would Pacino have eventually made it due to his talent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously you are getting into a deep argument.

And seeing from the few upvotes I got on a different thread mentioning the competition I feel I am not alone.

The work put into the contest, perhaps it should have been more open. Who are making the decisions? Internet randoms for the most part and one known person. 

Deserved to win? In your opinion. When the runners up and honourable mentions posted on the sub that time were that bad makes you wonder about the competency of the judges.

I believe you have good intentions with the FAQ but my point still stands. 5 books and links to 5 script sites and maybe what 5 competition/board pages. That is all that it is. 

All other advice on here is just the same old hat, devolving into pissing contests for the insecure. </TEXT>

Link them on the side.

Stop putting work on yourself mate.

It's probably a dead sub and I can't see it growing too far. 14K users my ass. Very little responses in general and those who do seem to be angry and full of bile.

And I repeat reading the highlighted competition lists made me reconsider ever even commenting on here. And I am sure I am not alone.

Ten pages with nothing. Shortlisted.

Bad Tarantino rip off. Shortlisted. 

Not saying terrible but if anyone posted the same on here openly they would be ripped to pieces. Pissed on is the word. Yes, I have read them. Pissed on. 

Sort that problem out first. Don't bother with FAQs for a sub where no one really cares and those involved don't seem to offer any better advice than can be posted with 5 amazon links and 5 links to script sites.

Save the effort I think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are talking a good 80%. And not even the world famous prize winners. I'm talking the average.

They get grants and teaching positions after publishing a few stories.

Although nearly every agent says they do not want short story collections they go about publishing a collection before the novel.

They come out of college and into a super job at a major paper or magazine.

They get agents with unfinished manuscripts. Producers appear and ask to see their scripts.

Everything seems so easy. I know for everyone of these there is a Joyce or McCarthy but I just don't see the angles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know Nabokov did something similar.

Most people say write first draft then pare back 20% or so.

What about the other way, write the main thrust of the work, perhaps even as much as 50% and then when you go to rewrite it expand upon it?

Does this even make sense at all?

I'm just lost. </TEXT>
