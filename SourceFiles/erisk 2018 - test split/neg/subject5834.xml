<TEXT> I play with this racquet and would rate myself between 4.0-4.5. I used to play with lighter racquets and moved up to this one. I would consider it an intermediate-level racquet. The moderate weight and 18x20 string pattern make it a pretty good racquet to develop your game with. It's main strength is control; it wont give you a ton of spin or power, but provides enough of each. I have since added about 14g of lead tape throughout the racquet to add a bit more power and a more solid feel. Overall, I would recommend to any 3.5-4.5 player.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only way for Fed to break out of his funk is to win a long rally with a beautiful shot. Tbh he had really been in a funk for most of the match, but it worsened in the third set. That backhand pass in the second game helped him big time.  </TEXT>
