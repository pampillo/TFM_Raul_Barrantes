If you want to use social media, do it.  If it upsets you that some people think people who don't use social media are happier than you, it just proves their point.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was really pumped to see him explode.  I love his character, but I really needed him to die in this episode.  He made that comment to Sasha, something like, "If they get themselves killed, that's on them.  It's the result of their actions."  And so I loved the idea that he would die simply because he picked the wrong side.

So I was disappointed the explosives didn't go off.  Honestly, they could have done without the McPoyles and started their attack on Negan by exploding Eugene and taking out a few saviors before Negan calls for a ceasefire and reveals Sasha's coffin.  Then the same dramatic shit plays out, the Saviors make some gains but Maggie and the Kingdom arrive.

<TEXT> This is was a really good episode.  It shouldn't have been, but it was.  There was plenty to be upset about, but somehow it didn't matter.  I think it's because of the slow burn of this season.  I was desperate for something, anything, and this latest episode sort of gave us something, I think.

The big problems:  

* Nobody died, other than Sasha.  With all the shooting going on and utter mayhem, no one significant got killed.  Major plot armor.
* Nobody shot the tall garbage pail kid.  She was on a watch tower in the middle of all the action and the leader of the gang.  An easy and obvious target.
* Nobody notices a huge fuckin' tiger sneaking up on you?
* How did Negan manage to hold court in the middle of a shootout?  Weird.

And yeah, basically everything relates to that shootout.  How did anyone tell people apart?  Why did Maggie and the tiger arrive at such a convenient time?  Why does nobody think to shoot the main characters, you know the people causing all this shit in the first place?   </TEXT>

He's the cause of some of this shit.  He says things, and people react.  

He's unwittingly leaking classified info.  He gets reports about classified info, makes a public comment based on it, and later the stuff is revealed or the consequences of the intelligence findings come to be.

The Russians are feeding him information and/or causing stuff to happen in support of him.  It would be like if Putin said, "Don't worry about that Schiff guy.  He won't be around much longer."  And Trump tweets, "Sad to hear about Schiff.  Prayers to his family."  And three days later he dies in a car crash.

<TEXT> It's nonsensical!  I can give it thought, but that doesn't change the answer.  They look the same to me in whatever they're wearing.  I literally do not care, not out of laziness but out of the simple fact that it does not matter to me one iota.  They look the same in a red shirt as they do in a blue shirt.  

The fact that you and people like you think that apathy can't be a valid answer is ridiculous.  If I flipped it on them and demanded them to pick a favorite football team, would that not be equally ridiculous?  Should I be mad at them for not being able to tell me who would make a better starting quarterback?  If I ask them what team I should bet on, and they tell me "Whichever you think is best", should I demand they make a choice for me, one which I will be sure to hold them accountable for when the game is over?

I would hope not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're exactly like them.  So how would I get you to shut up about it and stop asking me?  You seem insistent on me having an opinion, when I seriously see no difference between a red bracelet or a blue bracelet other than the fact that yes they are different colors.  How are colors inherently better than any other colors?  Isn't it entirely dependent on what you wear it with?  And isn't that subject to change regularly?  How am I supposed to be expected to tell you which I like best when I am completely apathetic to both equally?  I like them the same, as in I don't care for either, which isn't to say that I dislike them both.  

How can you not understand that?  How do I get it through to people like you? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> They both ask me for suggestions often.  When I have something to offer, I offer it.  Sometimes I don't care or have no insight into the problem.  For example, most "girly" things.  They'll ask me to help pick out jewelry for each other as birthday gifts.  They'll ask me my which blouse looks best.  Or whatever.

I honestly do not care, and I don't think my opinion counts anyway.  How am I an expert on fashion?  I'm not.  They should know better than me.  I say thinks like, "Whichever you want" or "I don't know" or "It's not my area" and they seem to get upset.

Is there some secret to just getting them off my back about this and trusting me when I say "I don't know"?  

It's not like I'm indecisive.  If they ask me a question I have an opinion about or am knowledgeable about, I'll tell them what I think.

**tl;dr:**  I don't have an opinion, but my mom and girlfriend try to force one out of me anyway. </TEXT>
