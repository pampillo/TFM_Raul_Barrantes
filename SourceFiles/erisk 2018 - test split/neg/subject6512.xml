<TEXT> There is no such thing as truly objective news, period. The subject has nothing to do with it. News is a selection, which means professional journalists decide what is newsworthy enough to be reported.  
When a story is written, decisions are made as well: News has to put into context. What it means has to be explained in a concise manner so non-experts (you) are able to grasp what happened and what it means in a short amount of time. Some aspects are known, and others are left out because there's not an infinite amount of space for or time for the text, and the audience has limited time and a limited attention span.    
  
Journalists may strive for a degree of objectivity or neutrality, but it is not something that is ever fully attainable. On top of that, there's the question if it's useful to try to strive for it.  
If you're interested, search for "the voice from nowhere" to read more about it. </TEXT>

If you choose [the detailed comparison chart](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/vpn-comparison-chart/) you can sort by jurisdiction (the country they're based in). It's an easy way to get an overview of VPN providers based in the EU. You can use the contents of the other fields to make an informed decision about which provider is best suited to your needs.  
  
If you want to use it for multiple devices and family use, consider configuring your home network router to connect to the VPN. That way any device on your home network will connect to the internet through your VPN.  
  
r/VPN is a good resource for more detailed advice.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much every big service you use right now started as a small startup by a few coders with little cash on hand. You built something, you threw it online, and went from there.  
With zero-rating, every startup suddenly has to negotiate with ISPs all over the world before they have the time, cash, staff or even user base to do so.  
Like /u/crazyhit said, it seems like a good thing for the services you use now, but the next Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, Reddit, Snapchat, Instagram or whatever will get killed off in their infancy due to zero rating and/or the end of net neutrality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's hard to say what will be the thing that gets him nailed, if he does get nailed at all. [Al Capone comes to mind.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Capone) A novel approach did him in:  
  
In 1927, the Supreme Court ruled that illegally earned income was subject to income tax; Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. rejected the argument that the Fifth Amendment protected criminals from reporting illegal income.[55] The IRS special investigation unit chose Frank J. Wilson to investigate Capone, with the focus on his spending. The key to Capone's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay tax.  
  
Who knows what new trick or mistake will be Trump's undoing? So far, conventional or easy-to-spot rule-breaking hasn't done the job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with the first paragraph of your comment, but the second one is problematic.  
  
Privacy and anonymity aren't synonyms. Anonymity is a tool that is sometimes used to protect one's privacy with. Privacy is a right without which there'd be no freedom or safety.  
  
Journalism would be impossible if sources' identities can't be protected. If you could lose your job for talking to a journalist, and you had no means to protect your identity, you would not speak to a journalist, even if you felt some of what you know should be known to the public.  
Dissenters living under repressive regimes would be silenced before they could even hope to effect change.  
You, personally, have a certain degree of freedom because you're fairly anonymous in public. (Of course, that's all changing thanks to facial recognition and other identification through biometrics, and the ~~trackers~~ smartphones in our pocket.)  
  
As for privacy, deciding who you let know what about you when gives you control over your own life. Technology is taking that away and handing the control to others. The GDPR is an imperfect attempt at restoring some of your control over your own life. </TEXT>

We are not on the same page: You believe limiting speech is a risk-free exercise.

But I'm not sure any safeguard can be adequate, since we're dealing with humans. </TEXT>

I am trying to think out loud with you about what it would mean to use this tool by asking questions like: What does it mean to limit speech, and what are the unintended or unwanted consequences?  
  
And as I've tried to show, we all would suffer, because we don't know who's going to be in charge tomorrow, nor do we know if the people in charge right now will change their minds tomorrow.

<TEXT>  You should not be allowed to [...] propose the removal of basic rights from other people.  
  
Ironically, you are proposing to limit one of their basic rights ;) But* putting that aside for a moment:
  
One of the weird upsides to someone challenging basic rights is that other people are forced to think about and defend these rights. It forces people to ask why we have those rights, what life would be like without them, and if there's room for improvement.  
  
Why would you want to force silence on others? The ideas would still exist and fester in an echo chamber  and darkness. Speaking about them openly creates the opportunity to challenge their ideas and, eventually, to change their minds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Who gets to decide which ideas are legitimate? Many ideas we now consider as good or even vital were deemed illegitimate in the past. (The idea - and now fact - that the earth revolves around the sun instead of the sun around the earth comes to mind.)  
  
There's not an easy answer, and I'm not necessarily against outlawing racist speech, but outlawing any speech means that you create a degree of acceptability for it, and an infrastructure to ban or prosecute said speech. That infrastructure can then be used to ban other speech, speech that should be legitimate. That is, if there are such things as legitimate and illegitimate speech. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is how the attack works:  
  
To break into a victims account, the attackers first acquire the username and password  possibly gathered from previous data breaches that revealed millions of account credentials. Because people often recycle passwords or use variations on the same password, prior leaks can put seemingly unrelated accounts at jeopardy.  
  
Once the attackers entered the username and password, they would have to gain access to a two-factor authentication code  a secondary protection that sends a temporary login code to a device associated with a user. It often comes in the form of a text message sent to the users primary phone number.  
  
This type of protection typically ensures a login attempt is from the purported user, as it requires physical access to the device itself to receive the code. However, using an exploit in SS7, the attackers were able to intercept that message containing the two-factor login code before it arrived on the users device.  
  
With access to that code, the attackers could then enter the victims bank account and drain it of money by transferring the funds to another account. [(source)](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/criminals-exploit-flaw-mobile-networks-232559308.html)  
  
In the article of the German paper that first reported it, it says that the attackers tended to operate at night, hoping that it would reduce the chance of the victim noticing that the phone had connected to a foreign network.  
So a basic understanding of the system will not help you if you're not able to notice the attack.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ik ontken de bezwaren die je maakt niet, en deel je zorgen. Ik denk alleen dat onder druk alles vloeibaar wordt, dus ook deze bezwaren. Als je moet kiezen tussen verarming van Nederland en geen pensioen, of een buurman met een andere culturele achtergrond, zal de keuze snel gemaakt zijn, denk ik.  
In mijn achterhoofd heb ik ook de klimaatproblemen die de komende decennia een ongekend grote vluchtelingenstroom op gang zal brengen. De vluchtelingen uit Syrie - een conflict dat mede-veroorzaakt is door klimaatverandering - is slechts een klein voorproefje. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Remaining part of the EU would be good for privacy. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will go into effect soon, well before Brexit becomes a reality, so UK businesses will still need to comply. The GDPR gives users/citizens more ownership and control over their data and the data they generate by using (digital) goods and services. The EU will likely continue on this path to protect privacy, while the UK seems hellbent on doing the opposite (the Investigatory Powers Act aka Snoopers' Charter, and the Digital Economy Bill come to mind).
  
Then there's the Court of Justice of the European Union which has been helpful at times: https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/dec/21/eus-highest-court-delivers-blow-to-uk-snoopers-charter

And there are many possible points of interception: The place it is stored, the place where the backups are stored, the data in transit, and the point of collection (your lenses).  
  
Then there's humans. Humans create and maintain the technology that makes this possible. Humans are flawed, so the technology is inherently flawed too. On top of that they are corruptible, they are curious, they have their own goals. There's a practice known as [LOVEINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOVEINT). That will tell you how reliable humans are when you give them access to personal data.  
  
But **the biggest privacy violation of all**: You are recording your interactions with other people. And it will be impossible to get consent from all of them. You may be free from the consequences after you die, but they are still alive. Whoever gains access to your data, now has access to information about these individuals, which means they now have some degree of power over them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> a) can they tell who it is (what house, person, etc.  

If they wanted to, yes. They could identify the traffic from a certain subscriber. Which person would be harder, because they would have to guess which person in the household is looking at what.  
  
b) could they see pages I visit, posts I make, and emails/imessages I send or just the overall site url?  
  
Unless the site you visit uses SSL to encrypt traffic between you and their server, they ISP is able to see the content of your traffic if they wanted to. Sites you visit that start with http:// are an open book. Sites you visit that start with http**s**:// encrypt your traffic. This means that your ISP can only see that you are connecting to that site, but not the information that is being exchanged, like which pages you're visiting.  
  
If your e-mail traffic is encrypted, your ISP won't be able to see it. Unless they host your e-mail. iMessage is encrypted end-to-end, so they won't be able to see the contents of your messages.  
  
If you wish to shield your traffic from your ISP, you should consider using a paid VPN. A VPN is an encrypted connection between you and a server of your VPN provider. Your ISP will see nothing but gibberish.  
  
Go to r/VPN and r/privacytoolsIO for advice, and read their sidebars.  
  
In the meantime, when you want to watch porn, make sure you only use sites that support SSL, like Pornhub, xVideos, and XHamster, and that you're using that SSL connection by making sure the URL is prefixed with http**s**://
Again, they will be able to see that you're visiting that site, but they won't be able to see which video you're looking at. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Marvel's Daredevil on Netflix. First episode, toward the end. A registered nurse helped the hero to torture a man more effectively.  
  
Torture in fiction isn't harmless. The Fox show "24" prepared the American minds for the torture that was to follow in Abu Graib in Iraq and in Camp X-Ray / Guantanamo Bay.  
I'm not going to support a show that features torturers as heroes by watching it.

The same goes for the show Chicago P.D. The whole 'it takes a bad guy to catch a bad guy' bullshit doesn't work for me.

<TEXT> The original of the strings sampled in the track you posted is:

[Millie Jackson - We Got To Hit It Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BW8GHPCGaA)  
  
Edit: Some of the stuff at the beginning is sampled from Roy Ayers - Sweet Tears, which has great strings too:  
  
- [Roy Ayers - Sweet Tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1NHSPo_-W8)
 - [Nuyorican Soul - Sweet Tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6NdR6BOQx8)  
  
If you dig strings, these two are the tunes for you:  
  
- [Sister Sledge - Reach Your Peak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsEGEfwfs0) (Strings @ 2:11)  
- [Quincy Jones - Tell Me A Bedtime Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-63w7ZnKy5c) (Strings @ 2:18)   
 - Bonus: [Quincy Jones - Tell Me A Bedtime Story (Opolopo Cut'n'Paste Edit)](https://soundcloud.com/soulbowl/quincy-jones-tell-me-a-bedtime) (The fun starts at 2:20)  
  
A lot of stuff by Salsoul Records features The Salsoul Orchestra, which had a killer string section, so be sure to look into that.  
  
This record has a great set of strings as well: [Double Exposure - My Love Is Free (Tom Moulton Mix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM693cb903U), and here it is without the strings and the vocals, for contrast: [Double Exposure - My Love Is Free (Demo Acetate Instrumental)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXFpPqFRKXM) </TEXT>

Edit: Looked up their blog posts to back up my reply:

[Facebook](https://blog.whatsapp.com/499/Facebook)

Quotes:  
  
Heres what will change for you, our users: nothing.
WhatsApp will remain autonomous and operate independently.
  
and  

There would have been no partnership between our two companies if we had to compromise on the core principles that will always define our company, our vision and our product.  
  
[Setting the record straight](https://blog.whatsapp.com/529/Setting-the-record-straight)
  
Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA, and we built WhatsApp around the goal of knowing as little about you as possible  
  
and  
  
If partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldnt have done it. Instead, we are forming a partnership that would allow us to continue operating independently and autonomously.

<TEXT> Even if it's encrypted end-to-end, there's still meta data available: which devices spoke to each other, at which time, from which locations, etc.  
  
Encryption is all or nothing. It either works, or it doesn't. If you weaken everything that depends on encryption for security. Banking, shopping, proprietary information, classified docs and communication, etc.  
  
Instead of breaking encryption - which would aid mass surveillance - intelligence agencies and police are increasingly allowed to hack the endpoints. You don't have to try to decrypt data in transit when you can hack the device where you can find the data before it is encrypted and after it is decrypted. It's not perfect, but it's better than indiscriminate mass surveillance, because it is targeted and takes effort.

<TEXT> De privacyinbreuk begint bij het opslaan van de gegevens. Het feit dat die koppeling gemaakt *kan* worden is het probleem. Het verzamelen en opslaan van gegevens brengt risico's met zich mee: Medewerkers die oneigenlijk gebruik maken van hun toegang; Onbevoegden die zich toegang verschaffen tot die gevens; het uitlekken van de gegevens. Als die gegevens er niet zijn, loopt de klant ook geen risico.
  
Het GVB is zoals elk ander bedrijf verplicht om betalingsgevens te bewaren. Als pinautomaat W op buslijn X zit, en er is bekend dat er daar op een bepaalde datum en tijd gepind is van rekeningnummer Y voor bedrag Z, dan is er dus een registratie van een reis van de pashouder van rekeningnummer Y. Aan bedrag Z is dan te zien hoe ver die persoon op dat moment van plan was te gaan reizen.  
  
Wat betreft die 'als': ik zeg daar 'als' omdat ik het niet weet. Dat ik het niet weet betekent niet automatisch dat het niet zo is, net zoals het niet betekent dat het wel zo is.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hoe is inderdaad een interessante vraag, waar ik niet direct een antwoord op heb. En het zou heel goed een onoverkomelijk gegeven kunnen zijn, en dus een fusie in de weg zitten. Mijn initiele comment ging over hoe het zou werken *als* het zou werken. *Of* het zal werken is een ander, en inderdaad veel ingewikkelder verhaal. Ik gaf het niet voor niets een kleine kans! </TEXT>

<TEXT> De PvdA is een partij waarbij alles open bediscussieerd mag worden. Elkaar hard aanvallen en ideeen lanceren hoort bij de partijcultuur. Intern zien ze dit als democratisch - of op z'n minst als noodzakelijk kwaad. De buitenwereld ziet het vaak als een blijk van gebrek aan loyaliteit en, idd, een negatief process. </TEXT>

De GL-standpunten zullen dan denk ik leidend worden, De extra PvdA-zetels geven GL dan de kracht om deze standpunten sterker te vertolken. En al helemaal als de zetels van de SP er ook bij komen, maar die kans acht ik nog velen malen kleiner. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if it's *the* problem, but it is *a* big problem, yes. I wouldn't describe it as* just aesthetics, because a good UX/UI is more than just 'looking good'. Poor UI/UX is one of the causes of a different problem with privacy tools:  
  
more technically skilled users may benefit from enabling optional browser features (including those squirreled away in power user interfaces) and installing and configuring browser extensions. In general, in an open platform, technologically savvy users are in a dramatically better position to protect their privacy and security, whereas in a closed platform, privacy and security outcomes are relatively uniform. Neither model is strictly better for privacy, but they do result in very different outcomes.  
  
Inequality of privacy outcomes based on technical skill is worrying by itself, but also because such skill correlates with historically advantaged groups. It is a concern for researchers: new privacy technologies favor the tech savvy, so privacy research may exacerbate inequality in privacy outcomes unless combined with outreach efforts. This bias towards the tech savvy may also lead to a focus on technologies that are simply unsuitable for mainstream use, such as PGP. Inequality is especially a concern for the open-source model of privacy tool development, because in most cases there is no funding for usability testing or user education. There is a clear role for journalists, privacy activists, and civil society organizations to bridge the gap between developers and users of privacy tools. Consumer protection agencies could also play a role.

He wrote it right after the Snowden revelations started in 2013, and it has been updated in 2015. The concrete, technical advice is dated, but the theoretical advice still holds up.

<TEXT> Several ways.

1) Contact the CIA directly. (Where you'll get a 'no comment' response.)  
2) National security reporters have a network of people they talk to on and off the record, to stay informed. They will approach relevant people in this network to see if they can confirm or deny the authenticity of the information. If they can't, they may know someone who will and point the journo in the right direction.  
3) Tech reporters have similar networks in the security community. They will try to find people who can prove or disprove the technical aspects in the documents.  
  
I'm probably missing some, but these are some of the basics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for sharing the link. Not sure if 'believe' is the right word. A source told their natsec reporter that it's authentic:

A CIA spokesman declined to comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents.  
  
**An intelligence source said** some of **the information does pertain to tools that the CIA uses** to hack computers and other devices. This person said disclosing the information would jeopardize ongoing intelligence-gathering operations and the revelations were far more significant than the leaks of Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency who exposed active surveillance programs in 2013.

Don't underestimate the power of proof. If these documents are authentic, and if the claims made in them are true, they can be used to build legal cases, help journalists find proof of similar operations, help vendors to get their shit together, and help users to force vendors to get their shit together, etc.

<TEXT> I tend to agree with you, but it is up to OP to decide how much of their privacy they want to give up per use case. Instagram being a Facebook app, I think it's likely there are less infringing alternatives out there that will either collect less info on their users, or give their users more control over their data. It doesn't have to be all or nothing, although I agree that once something's out there, it's best to think of it as *out there*. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ik zal vanavond eens kijken als ik meer tijd heb, al maak je me weinig enthousiast door kattig te reageren op een gezegde in een poging mijn wedervraag te ontwijken.  
En je kan best een gevoel hebben dat het overdreven is, maar dan geef je eigenlijk al aan dat je ook voelt dat er een kern van waarheid in zit; Anders is er immers niks om te overdrijven.  
  
 dit hele 'heterowittemannen'-kartel  
  
Jouw bewoording geeft het door mij geschetste beeld niet goed weer. Door het woord *kartel* te gebruiken, ga je uit van een bewuste overeenkomst tussen blanke mannen om anderen buiten de deur te houden. En over de seksuele geaardheid van de mannen heb ik het nooit gehad. Als je bewijs of tegenbewijs zoekt voor een zo'n kartel mag je dat zelf gaan doen.  
  
Wat ik wel kan aantonen is achterstand op de arbeidsmarkt voor vrouwen en migranten. Waarom die bestaat is veel complexer, en weer een heel andere discussie.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Onze maatschappij bestaat niet alleen maar uit blanke mannen. Mannen hebben nog altijd een voorsprong op veel plekken in de maatschappij, plekken waar mensen macht hebben, serieus genomen worden, of een voorbeeldfunctie hebben. Die mannen komen elkaar steeds in die functies tegen, en dat wordt hun netwerk. Anderen komen er dan moeilijker tussen.  
Dat beeld van voornamelijk blanke mannen in voorbeeldposities kan onbewust doorwerken: Je vertrouwt wat je kent, en bent geneigd te wantrouwen wat je niet kent. Dit geeft iedereen die niet een blanke man is een achterstand.  
Kinderen en jongeren die naar zo'n debat kijken en die niet lijken op blanke witte mannen kunnen minder geneigd zijn te denken dat ze later ook politiek commentator of premier kunnen worden.  
  
Er hoeft van mij niet krampachtig gezocht worden naar een diverse groep commentatoren, maar af en toe de vraag stellen waarom we vaker blanke mannen zien dan anderen kan geen kwaad. Blanke mannen zijn echt niet per definitie beter dan alle anderen.  
  
Wat mij betreft zou iedereen zich moeten kunnen ontwikkelen en indien gekwalificeerd op elke plek terecht kunnen komen. Zolang blanke mannen voorsprong hebben komen anderen die misschien wel beter zijn niet naar voren.    
  
En dat zeg ik dus als blanke man.  
  
Om de bal even terug te kaatsen: Is het tegenovergestelde van diversiteit een goed doel? Een dominante groep, en dan de rest? </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) It's not about hiding. It's about control. It's about being able to freely choose what you share, with whom, and when. Knowledge about you is power over you. When you give up information, you give up control.  
  
2) You will not be judged by your own standards. Your employer, social circle and family, bank, society or government may have different ideas about what is acceptable or commendable behavior.

3) Times change, standards shift. Even if your standards are in line with everyone else's today, information about you may cause you trouble tomorrow, or in a decade. Example: Being Jewish wasn't life-threatening in Europe until it was. By then, many were well-documented. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've got it backwards. Most of us aren't trying (anymore) to remove what is already out there. We are trying to prevent more information about us from getting out there without our permission or knowledge.  
  
It's about control. Knowledge about you is power over you. The information collected is used to make decisions about you. What content are you presented with? What price do sites show you for the product you're interested in? Does your data profile make you eligible for that mortgage with a low interest rate? Will you be selected for a 'random' security check at the airport? You cannot expect to be judged by your own standards. And what is acceptable today may get you killed tomorrow. So information collected today that seems harmless, may be your undoing in ten years time. (I suggest reading this: https://medium.com/@hansdezwart/during-world-war-ii-we-did-have-something-to-hide-40689565c550 )  
  
And these days, there is just 'privacy', as 'internet privacy' has real-world consequences. You can't view it as separate, because the trackers, data-brokers and their clients certainly don't. And with the Internet of Things and Smart Cities, there is no hiding from it.  
  
Also, read the section called 'Ongoing' in the sidebar here, and try the Wiki/FAQ.  
  
Edit: Some more thoughts:  
  
Try to imagine being a Muslim in the U.S. right now. A core aspect of who you are has become controversial, and others may threaten your safety because of it. You might want to hide this aspect for your own safety, but you can't anymore. Your mobile phone records reveal where you shop and where you are at certain times. It's easy to determine that you eat halal food, or spend your time near a mosque at prayer times. Your contact list or your likes on Facebook will reveal the same.

And then there's the very real possibility that all this data collected about you points in a certain direction, but that the conclusion is wrong. You will be treated based on who the data says you are, not who you actually are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> De meeste daders van aanslagen in Europa die uit naam van ISIS zeggen te handelen zijn hier geboren en getogen. Ze komen uit wijken met sociale achterstanden zoals hoge werkloosheid en schooluitval. Die personen worden hier niet geboren als moslimextremist, ze maken een ontwikkeling door die ook door de omgeving wordt ingegeven. Het is niet puur hun geloof, net zoals bij de Katholieke kindermisbruikers.  
  
Ander punt: De aanslagpleger uit Nice had zich enkele dagen ervoor bekeerd tot de Islam en trouw gezworen aan ISIS, in een periode van flinke emotionele instabiliteit. Zo komt hij wel op het lijstje van moslimextremisten, terwijl het er op lijkt dat hij een excuus voor zelfmoord heeft gezocht.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I do think they have a point. There's a whole group of young voters with foreign ancestry who are not being represented. DENK has found a way to appeal to them, although how they do it and their suspected ties with Erdogan's Turkey may stop these voters from aligning themselves with DENK. Turkey isn't exactly a bastion of inclusivity and freedom at the moment.  
After ~15 years of anti-foreign and anti-Islamic sentiment in our national politics, it's not a big surprise that these Dutch descendants of immigrants and former subjects of our colonies are looking for a party to represent them.  
Labour seems to have been stuck in the middle of this polarizing trend. They've attempted to defend an inclusive society, but their old base - the former laborers and their modern equivalents - have responded to the call of the conservative and anti-EU parties SP and PVV. Not surprising, as a conservative message tends to do well during and in the wake of an economic crisis.  
Losing their base has made Labour weak and unsure, and their taking part in the coalition has forced them to abandon or minimize their ideals.
DENK has no such restrictions, and every incentive to highlight how they differ from Labour. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. In the House, [VVD and CDA vote the same 73% of the time](https://www.partijgedrag.nl/partijgelijkenis.php), they are very much a centre-right party. The main reason why their followers were upset when they entered a coalition with VVD was that it was a minority coalition supported by the PVV. This gave the PVV influence over policy, while exempting them from official responsibility for it. Many members of CDA felt that what they stood for could not mesh with what Wilders and his PVV stood for. Eventually they voted to join this odd coalition, but they alienated part of their base in doing so.  
 
2. One of the few fresh voices we have. I agree that the way he's presented comes across as artifical, but I view it as a means to an end; I don't doubt that he stands behind his message. His conviction is solid, how he tries to sell it to us isn't (yet).  
  
3. The SP has a different history and party culture than Labour. The SP is (viewed as) more conservative, wants to return to 'the good old times', and they still have remnants of their communist past; MPs are required to give a large chunk of their income to the party, it's a faux pas to speak out against the party line, etc.  
Labour is all about looking forward, and about the open clash of different ideas. It's why they have that messy internal election for who gets to lead the campaign.  
This fundamental difference in those parties' identities is the reason why all (former) Labour supporters and members I know would never support the SP. GroenLinks is much more their speed, although it's still not a perfect fit.  
  
4. I consider Krol a con man and believe he/his party are conning their supporters. I wish I knew how Krol is still in politics. He keeps pushing the false narative that the elderly are poor and worse off than previous generations. Repeating this message over and over in a Trump-like manner has made it seem true, I guess. In reality, they're the wealthiest generation of elderly ever, and the majority is doing very well. I do agree that care for the elderly should be of a higher standard.  
  
5. PvdD includes humans in its fight for animal rights. Their voting record in the House consistently makes them the most privacy-friendly party of all (closely followed by GroenLinks). They defend other civil rights as well, and value our [Rechtstaat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechtsstaat). Others have explained what they're about well, but I just wanted to add this bit.  
I've never voted for them, but I respect them a great deal.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Alcohol an sich is niet ongezond

Ik vrees dat je ongelijk hebt.

Alcohol verhoogt de kans op kanker. Bij 1 glas neemt de kans op borstkanker al toe. Bij 2 glazen is het risico verhoogd op kanker van de mond, keelholte en bepaalde vormen van slokdarmkanker. Bij 3 glazen alcohol per dag neemt de kans op darmkanker al toe (1).

Zon 4 tot 6% van alle kankersterfte moet aan alcohol worden toegeschreven. In 2011 overleden 44.000 mensen aan kanker (2). Bij 1760 tot 2640 gevallen is de ziekte toe te schrijven aan alcohol. Bij een grote Europese studie bleek dat onder mannen zelfs 10% van alle gevallen kan worden toegeschreven aan alcohol, bij vrouwen ligt dit  op 3% (3). Dat zou betekenen dat in Nederland er misschien wel  ruim 4000 mensen zijn, die kanker hebben gekregen door alcohol.

Leest de overheid straks mee met jouw appjes?  
  
In de strijd tegen terrorisme en andere misdaad wil de overheid alle communicatie tussen mensen onderling, maar ook met bedrijven, kunnen lezen en afluisteren. Hoe ver gaat de datadrift van de politie en de geheime dienst?

Could this be intended as another step taken to curtail the media in the UK? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no set definition of what makes a journalist. You're not the arbiter of who is or isn't a journalist. It's an open profession. These days, practically everyone commits acts of journalism.  
 
I'm not sure why you're going on about blogs, as these new proposals would affect your 'real journalists' as well. Merely receiving leaked materials would be enough to cause trouble. It's in the fifth paragraph:  
  
One legal expert said the new changes would see the maximum jail sentence increase from two years to 14 years; make it an offence to **obtain or gather rather than simply share** official secrets; and to extend the scope of the law to cover information that damages economic well-being.

There isn't enough interesting news to fill the cycle to attract viewers which attract advertisers. So if the channel wants to survive while airing 24 hours a day, it has no choice but to throw the serious news side under the bus and replace it with something else like infotainment.  
  
It's possible to make money off of serious journalism without destroying it. Before the Internet, newspapers had been doing it for eons. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  **Max Schrems: "People do not have time to protect their privacy on the Internet"**  
   
 By Lucie Ronfaut  
   
 **INTERVIEW - The Austrian student attacked Facebook and obtained the cancellation of the agreement governing the exchange of data with the United States. It calls for greater data protection for European citizens.**
 
 Max Schrems is not a student like the others. This Austrian doctoral student lodged a complaint in 2011 against Facebook for improper data retention on his users. This procedure led to the invalidation of Safe Harbor , the agreement that governed the exchange of data between Europe and the United States, and a global debate on the monitoring of online activities by the US government. His replacement, the Privacy Shield, is already being attacked by several privacy organizations. Its application is also threatened by Donald Trump, new president of the United States, who calls for increased surveillance of non-US citizens online . For his part, Max Schrems is fighting a new battle against Facebook to get recognition of a form of collective complaint at European level. His application must soon be examined by the European Court of Justice. Le Figaro met him to discuss this busy news.
 
 **LE FIGARO .- You consider that the Privacy Shield makes almost no improvement at Safe Harbor. Why?**
 
 **MAX SCHREMS.** - For me the Privacy Shield is more or less like the Safe Harbor, with a few more additions. The Safe Harbor was invalidated by the European Court of Justice because there was insufficient control over the guarantees offered by the United States to protect our data. The Privacy Shield merely asserts that these protections are equivalent to those in force in Europe. It is as if a teacher gave a bad note to one of his students and he was content to add three lines to his duty! It is for this reason that I think the Privacy Shield is likely to be attacked in court, or by the data protection authorities.
 **
 You think your fight was useless?**
 
 Not at all. I was disappointed that the European Commission does not use the judgment any further. They abandoned the idea of bending the United States when they should have gone much further. The US government has put pressure on Europe. Obtaining interesting contracts for car manufacturers is more important than the Privacy Shield. We could have waited a little longer, let the data protection authorities do their job. It's not like the Internet could explode in two days! But I am very happy with the judgment itself. It lays the foundation for limiting the oversight of any state. This decision does not apply only to the United States.
 
 **Are you planning to attack the Privacy Shield?**
 
 I hope someone else will take care of it. I am not preparing anything special. Two procedures are underway against the Privacy Shield, filed by the Quadrature du Net and Digital Rights (French and Irish associations for the defense of online rights, Ed.). I understand that the media needed a nice story to translate issues into concrete ways. I was the perfect example and this mediated a complex subject. But it also diverted the message a little. My initiative has been transformed into a struggle against America and its businesses, while I do not care. Now it's done and I want to move on.
 
 **Do you think the general public really cares about their privacy online?**
 
 This is a classic argument in the data protection debate: people choose not to worry about it. I hear that, but I also think that it is not a specific situation for privacy and digital. People do not have the time to understand the ins and outs of the nuclear energy debate, for example. They just use electricity. In the same way, they will not seek to understand how an application works and what it collects on them. Even some privacy experts are not capable so it's complicated! I am not saying that education is not an important thing, but that is not how we will win this debate. It's very American to say, "Just educate people and let them have the freedom to choose." They put a "danger attention" label on a hazardous product, and then it's up to us to decide if We want to use it or not. This approach is hypocritical. If something is really problematic, just change it. A person works on average ten hours a day, and just wants to be able to go on the Internet on his way home. She does not have time to understand and protect her privacy. We must remove the responsibility for this choice from the users, who can not assume it, and give it back to the companies.
 
 **Who should protect us?**
 
 Europe. In an ideal world, we would have a global agreement among all countries to determine what online privacy really is. But this will never happen. That is why the new data regulation , which will be implemented as early as 2018, is so important. Very high fines will be enforceable at European level. Individuals should also be allowed to make complaints more easily and to do so in groups. Class actions are very powerful tools. New arguments of complaint will be recognized, like that of moral damage. Finally, I would like to create a European data protection organization, bringing together developers and lawyers to defend the rights of all European consumers online. This is the last project I would like to pursue in the area of privacy.

Bundestag reports: New data retention is unlawful

Heise online 04.02.2017 6:20 pm Stefan Krempl  
  
According to an analysis of the scientific service of the Bundestag, the new law, which stipulates that providers will have to store metadata as of July, is not compatible with EU law. This has recently been confirmed by the European Court of Justice.

In an expert opinion on the left-wing fraction, the Scientific Service of the Bundestag concluded that the new law on the retention of data, which came into force at the end of 2015, could not be sustained in Europe. According to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the standards do not meet the requirements of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), "the fact that the storage of stored data is only permitted if a serious offense is suspected ", quotes the "Mitteldeutsche Zeitung".

Accordingly, the reviewers also refer to the announcement by the Luxembourg judges, according to which investigators are only allowed to collect connection and location data on "geographically defined areas", for example in the clearly defined area of a crime scene. In addition, professional secrecy such as members of parliament, doctors, lawyers or journalists would have to be exempted from the measure. The legislature has hitherto only regulated the fact that metadata of these groups are initially partly collected, but ultimately can not be exploited.

Data retention opponent on the upwind  
The analysis pours water on the mills of the opponents of the data retention, which have already submitted several constitutional complaints against the new legal requirements . They can now build on the fact that the Federal Constitutional Court is already tipping the guidelines again - otherwise the course would lead to the ECJ. As early as April 2014, the Luxembourg judges had tipped the EU directive on the easy logging of user lanes . In December, they further emphasized that metadata should be kept at best if this was strictly necessary and proportionate.

Jan Korte, vice-chancellor of the left-wing group, has confirmed the opinion "our criticism from the beginning". The fact that data relating to the connection and location of the entire population is not subject to any circumstances is a disproportionate interference with civil rights, which is fundamentally incompatible with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.

The opposition politician appealed to the federal government to finally limit the damage and immediately withdraw the controversial law. The affected telecommunication companies would otherwise have only until the beginning of July, time to implement the shaky conditions technically and to throw an estimated 600 million euros out of the window.

According to the local law, access providers must store connection information for ten, location data for four weeks. For technical reasons, text messages are sometimes recorded for SMS. The e-mail area should remain outside. Federal Minister of Justice Heiko Maas (SPD) had repeatedly emphasized in the debate about the initiative that this "fully justice" to the highest juridical jurisprudence . ( Ghi )  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Privacy isn't an all-or-nothing game. It's a lot of little decisions every single day. If you want a smartphone, that's fine. You can shift the tradeof in your favor as much as you want to. Lock it down, (password protection, hardened OS like CopperheadOS, secure messaging apps, etc.) and try to change your behavior in regards to your phone. Ask yourself each time if you need to bring it with you; Taking your smartphone with you to the airport or protests, for example, is a bad idea.  
If you have it with you, but don't want to be on the grid at all times, you can look into things like Faraday pouches: These pouches are small portable Faraday cages which block all signals.    
  
You can get a cheap feature phone aka dumb phone as cheap as $10 for when you want to be able to send and receive calls, but don't feel the need for an internet connection. If you don't want your dumb phone connected to you, buy it with cash, take the battery out before you go home, don't switch it on at home. Never carry it with you at the same time as you're carrying your smart phone, etc.  
  
Having a smartphone is one thing. It's how you use it that can make a real difference.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It could be, but it is a problem on a much, *much* smaller scale. Indiscriminate cross-border mass surveillance versus targeted, limited investigation.  
  
While some members of the press engage in ethically questionable behavior, the majority serves - or tries to serve - an essential role in democracies; to scrutinize those in power in attempt to keep them in check.

<TEXT> The animal rights party is a good example of a party that entered parliament on a one-issue platform, but which has expanded its focus and expertise as time went on. For example, according to their actual voting record, they are the most privacy-conscious party in our parliament. They do not advertise their pro-privacy / civil rights stance, but it shows they have a coherent agenda for issues that concern the 'human animal' ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Intelligence sharing with foreign intelligence services, for example through the 14 Eyes alliance mentioned by /u/ItGotZenified, allows the BND to do an 'end run' around domestic restrictions. They can't legally spy on their own citizens, but the foreign agencies can. Relevant data is shared.  
  
This story is probably also relevant to your questions: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/nsa-spied-on-eu-politicians-and-companies-with-help-from-german-intelligence/  
  
Unfortunately, I do not know much about domestic surveillance in Germany by national and local law enforcement.  
  
If you discover anything relevant on /r/Germany, please consider sharing it here to educate us all :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Netherlands is part of the Nine Eyes alliance. They definitely do share intel with the U.S.  
  
The 5-Eyes  
The NSA operates in close co-operation with four other English-speaking countries - the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - sharing raw intelligence, funding, technical systems and personnel. Their top level collective is known as the '5-Eyes'.  
  
Beyond that, **the NSA has other coalitions**, although intelligence-sharing is more restricted for the additional partners: **the 9-Eyes, which adds** Denmark, France, **the Netherlands** and Norway; the 14-Eyes, including Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Sweden; and 41-Eyes, adding in others in the allied coalition in Afghanistan.

Things have gotten more 'intimate' since then because of the terror attacks in France, Belgium and Germany. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The privacy invasion starts at the point of collection. They are taking something from you without your direct consent. Storing it puts you at risk for unauthorized access by those who have access to these systems, mistakes like being linked to a crime you didn't commit, hacks (with the possibility of altering your information) and leaks.  
  
Aside from all that, you may trust your current government with this information, but who knows who will control this in 5 or 10 or 50 years? Here's an actual real-world example of how it can go wrong:  
  
Of the 140,000 Jews who had lived in the Netherlands before 1940, only 30,000 (21%) survived the war. But the real picture was even worse than this suggests. **The Netherlands had the highest Jewish death toll of any western European country.** Of the approximately 107,000 Jews deported to the camps, only 5000 survived; a survival rate of less than 5%. On top of that, included in that number were about 900 Jews still in Westerbork at the war's end and not in the same extremis as those deported. **This high death toll had a number of reasons. One was the excellent state of Dutch civil records: the Dutch state, before the war, had recorded substantial information on every Dutch national. This allowed the Nazi regime to determine easily who was Jewish (whether fully or partly of Jewish ancestry) simply by accessing the data.**  
  
Btw: Your right to vote should be verified through your identity by confirming your citizenship, but your actual vote should never be linked to your identity. You need to be completely free from influence and consequence to be able to freely vote. If a record of your voting history exists, it may be used against you.   </TEXT>

He does show a fundamental misunderstanding of what the Privacy Shield is. It governs the transfer of data from the EU to the US. Protection against spying between member states could be part of other agreements, but has no place in the Privacy Shield.  
  
He also tries to make it seem like Yahoo didn't act in a grossly irresponsible manner:

Yahoo operated with good security, but not perfect security, much like every other prominent entity.  To blame Yahoo for the hackers assault on EU citizens privacy is unreasonable

Yeah, okay buddy. Yahoo acted against and moved around its own security team:

Natuurlijk zal veel van wat er te zien is in scene zijn gezet. Het team dat de voortvluchtigen moet opsporen heeft vrijwel realtime toegang tot de beelden van de beveiligingscameras op straat. In de praktijk zal het ook bij de politie lastiger zijn: het is niet erg waarschijnlijk dat zulke beelden vrijwel direct op het bureau zichtbaar zijn. Men zal immers eerst in kaart moeten brengen waar cameras hangen, wie de eigenaar van die camera is, iemand beschikbaar moeten hebben voor het vorderen van die beelden en dan blijkt natuurlijk ter plekke dat de meegebrachte apparatuur voor het kopiren van de beelden incompatibel is met de camera. In dat opzicht geeft de serie, mogen we hopen, een wel erg vertekend beeld. </TEXT>

- [Wet Computercriminaliteit III (ook bekend als het 'terughackvoorstel')](https://www.privacybarometer.nl/maatregel/86/Inbraakbevoegdheid_voor_politie)

In de rechter kolom onder 'Stemming' kun je zien hoe de partijen tot nu toe gestemd hebben, of welke partijen al hebben aangegeven hoe te stemmen.

PvdA en VVD sowieso voor, want regeringspartijen. CDA ook voor. Ik weet bijna zeker dat de Partij voor de Dieren tegen gaat stemmen, aangezien zij vrijwel altijd voor privacy kiezen. GroenLinks is meestal ook privacybewust. D66 heeft de mond vol van privacy, maar het stemgedrag laat het tegenovergestelde zien.

En inderdaad, de Piraten Partij kiest ook voor privacy: https://programma.piratenpartij.nl/kernpunten#gebruik_vertrouwelijke_gegevens </TEXT>

Agreed.

I would add something about acting responsibly with the information you have of others: contact information, birth dates, face pics, etc. Installing a social media app may result in you giving other people's personal information to that social media company. (Un)knowingly making that choice for others is something we should advise against. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great comment!

At the risk of being accused of focusing on the details, I'd like to say something about the advice to 'get off Facebook'. I'm using your words as a jumping off point, I am not attacking you personally for it. And I'm also going to mention stuff you've already covered in your comment :)

Disclaimer: I don't have a Facebook account, and I have no love for the company or its platforms.

Telling someone who is just getting started with taking control of their life through making privacy-conscious choices that they should start by getting off Facebook may discourage them before they even begin.  
They may not be ready to make the big step of disconnecting from the friends and family who still use Facebook as their main social outlet.  
  
Even someone who deeply cares about their digital privacy can choose to use Facebook while knowing the risk. Privacy is about deciding for yourself what you wish to show or hide, with whom, when, where, etc. And you can choose to share part of your life with Facebook.
(We know the problem with Facebook is that they often make those decisions *for you*, but the newbie might not be there yet, others might not consider it a problem.)  
  
Anyone who has ever tried to convince a friend or family member to leave Facebook knows that convincing others to leave that platform isn't easy at all.  
  
If we present it as a basic first step, we ignore the weight of the social implications it may have for a person. And by ignoring that, we may cause them to lose the motivation to make privacy-positive changes in their life.  
  
The process of taking back privacy is an incremental one. It takes a little effort every day, a lot of small decisions every day. There is no universal first step.  
  
Everyone needs to decide for themselves which steps they are willing to take today. And I believe it's our job to help them do it, regardless of where they feel comfortable to begin taking control. </TEXT>

You never know when you're going to be the person of interest, and you never know how what is known about you is going to be interpreted. To have information collected and stored about you, is to be put at risk. The privacy infringement starts at the point of collection, even if it's never used for a purpose other than storing it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Amnesty limited their research to the 11 most used messenger apps. Signal's not in that top 11.  
They're trying to pressure insecure messengers to implement end-to-end-encryption by default. They didn't realize their list could end up being used to recommend the wrong kinds of messengers.

They do actually recommend Signal in their campaign: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/10/really-practical-ways-to-protect-your-privacy-online/

But I don't know if they decided to do that after receiving a lot of heat for that top 3. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The big difference is that the leaks are not lies but truths.

You shouldn't blindly believe every word to be true in the leaks. If a state actor or a prankster is leaking these caches, you should expect at least part of them to be tampered with or flat out planted.  
Leakers have a goal in mind, and will use the legitimate documents as cover to make their additions seem legit.

This is why journalists still have a role in this process, and why they should take the time to thoroughly vet each document before publishing any story based on them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're wondering what you can do in addition to opting out, I recommend the following steps:

Check out https://privacytools.io/ to see which tips work for you.

Use the add-ons [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation) and [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) to block trackers. Use [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) to force a secure connection when one is available.
If you have an Android phone or tablet, you can use [Firefox for Android](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/android/) as a browser, which is compatible with the add-ons I mentioned.

And if you want, you can subscribe to the following subreddits:

<TEXT> Thinking out loud:
Ghostery is proprietary and has opt-in tracking of its users. Privacy Badger is open source and built by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org/). Based on that, I would pick PB.

And the goal of PB is to block trackers, not to block ads. It doesn't block ads that don't track you, or at least that's the goal. Ghostery does block (some) ads. 
If you wish to support the sites you visit and agree with he display ad business model, PB may be the one for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again, it's not just your search history. It's everything you do online that's being tracked through DoubleClick, Google Analytics, Google+ share buttons, etc. And that's just Google.
All that information is being used to make assumptions about you to target ads, to personalize search results, etc.

The privacy breach starts at the point of collection. Merely collecting it and storing it puts you at risk. Making assumptions about you puts you at risk. That information can be exposed through a hack, a leak, a rogue Google employee, a government request for data, etc.

I don't know how it affects you personally because I know nothing about you, and I don't know if you're of interest to Google, a government, or some other entity or adversary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Knowledge is power. Knowledge about you is power over you.

You don't know exactly what they collect and store about you. You don't know if it's accurate or false. You don't know who has access, whether within the company, their partners, or through hacking or leaking. You don't know which decisions are being made about your life outside of your control.

We already know that we don't all pay the same price for the same thing. If you're trying to buy a plane ticket online, the same trip will cost you more if you order it from an iPad than if you order it from an Android device. Age, sex, location, estimated income, political affiliations, etc. all influence how your online environment is shaped around you, for better or for worse.  
  
Now, this might all not matter to you. That's fine. If you're a white adult male in a western country with no clear political motivation, and you don't work in politics, in market regulation, as a journalist, as a doctor, are not (chronically) ill, don't have a substance addiction or other mental health issues, etc. and never will, you'll probably be fine, right? Wrong. Society changes around you and even your currently innocent attributes and predilections may be judged differently and cause problems for you. Who knows where you will be in life in 20 years? Who knows what society will be like? Who will be in power?

Imagine you're a gay man in an African country where homosexuality is against the law. Suddenly liking Britney Spears on Facebook can become evidence that may be used against you.

And even if you trust the current leadership at Google and Facebook, you don't know who will be at the helm in 10 years. They may go bankrupt, and the current practice with bankruptcies is to auction off any customer data they may have to the highest bidder. They ~~may~~ **will** get hacked.  
  

There is now a permanent record of us entertaining new thoughts, trying new things. We can no longer form our thoughts in private, experiment without being held accountable.

And as /u/skyroket notes, governments love this treasure trove of data. And not just the governments you deem benevolent and trustworthy.

Second step is checking out https://privacytools.io/ to see which tips work for you.

Use the add-ons uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger to block trackers. Use HTTPS Everywhere to force a secure connection when one is available.
If you have an Android phone, you can use Firefox for Android as a browser, which is compatible with the add-ons I mentioned.

And if you want, you can subscribe to the following subreddits:

- /r/privacy 
- /r/europrivacy 
- /r/privacytoolsIO
- /r/StallmanWasRight

<TEXT> In remote areas it will probably not be cost-efficient to have high capacity vehicles. In cities and suburbia people may prefer smaller capacity vehicles and pay accordingly.  
  
Smaller vehicles are more efficient in getting people from door to door. Otherwise you're either taking groups on huge detours, or they have to disembark at fixed points, like busses do now.  
  
A pod-like system is more efficient. 2 or 4 person pods can join up with other pods to form a train when they're going the same route over a highway, but split up to get individuals and small groups to their destination in suburbs and cities.

Highways would still be needed, but 8 lanes would be a bit much, yeah. </TEXT>

From anonymized statistics on our website we know that Tails is used by around 18 000 people every day. If each of them gave 12, the price of a USB stick, our budget for the whole year would be raised within one day. As you can see, funding Tails through donations is a realistic and our budget ridiculously small compared to the multibillionaire companies and agencies running the surveillance business.

In that paragraph they [link to this](https://tails.boum.org/support/faq/index.en.html#boot_statistics):

**Does Tails collect information about its users?**

When Tails starts, two HTTPS requests are made automatically to our website through Tor:

A security check is performed to know if security issues have been announced for this version of Tails. The language of the working session is passed along with this request to display the notification in the preferred language of the user.
Tails Upgrader checks for newer versions. The version of the running Tails is passed along with this request.
We believe it is important to notify the user of known security issues and newer versions. We calculate statistics based on the security check to know how many times Tails has been started and connected to Tor. Those statistics are published in our monthly reports. </TEXT>

<TEXT> r/privacy has nearly 70,000 subscribers, but there are orders of magnitude more people on Facebook, Instagram, Yahoo and whatnot who are either completely oblivious to being tracked and surveilled or simply don't care.

I believe it's wrong to assume that everyone who uses those services isn't aware of the implications for their privacy, or that they simply do not care.  
  
Caring about your privacy doesn't mean you have to stop using any of those services. Privacy is about deciding for yourself who you share your information with. If they choose to use Facebook and are comfortable using it even while knowing (insofar as anyone can know) what they are doing with your data, it cannot be taken as a sign that they simply do not care about privacy or surveillance.  
  
Then there's the problem with people being weak and dependent on their social ties. They are hostages of those platforms, because they value keeping up with friends and family over using other, less infringing platforms. They can both care and not leave Facebook.  
  
Awareness is spreading, legislation is getting better at catching up ([in Europe at least](/r/europrivacy)), and thanks to Snowden journalists no longer have a hard time selling stories with a privacy angle to media.  
  
Change is hard to see because it moves at a glacial pace. That doesn't mean it's not happening.  
  
A few days ago I talked with two subscribers of [my sub](/r/europrivacy) who just started caring about their privacy. Over the summer they had each watched Citizenfour and subsequently decided to change their habits: new OSes on their devices, use of privacy protecting add-ons, reading up on the state of privacy in their respective countries, etc.  

It started three years ago, yes, but we are still seeing and feeling the effects of the Snowden revelations today. Journalists are *still* working on new stories based on his docs.  
  
Cheer up, and try to see the changes.

<TEXT> Because of a possible ad block / pay wall issue, I have quoted the full piece here:

WIRED OPINION
ABOUT
Mathematician Cathy ONeil (@mathbabedotorg) is the author of Weapons Of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy.

---

THE AGE OF Big Data has generated new tools and ideas on an enormous scale, with applications spreading from marketing to Wall Street, human resources, college admissions, and insurance. At the same time, Big Data has opened opportunities for a whole new class of professional gamers and manipulators, who take advantage of people using the power of statistics.

I should know. I was one of them.



In 2007 I was a hedge fund quant, working at D.E. Shaw. I was trained to anticipate what others would do so I could do the opposite. It was my profession to game the system. Was this stock just mentioned on TV? Bet on the bounce. Are mutual funds forced to true up their accounts by the end of the quarter? Bet on the market impact of their predictable trading. Is everyone using the same risk model? Anticipate the outcomes. There was money to be made finding patterns and exploiting them, some of it coming from pension funds and 401Ks, other from nameless and faceless heaps of international wealth. We thought we deserved it because we had the technology and because we were faster and better with numbers. It was never about market efficiency; it was dumb money versus smart money, and we took advantage whenever we could.

This behavior is by no means unique to finance. One of the early, influential algorithms is the college-ranking model from U.S. News   World Report. In fact, its been so influential, the role of many college administrators has gradually changed from improving academics to improving their colleges ranking, whatever the cost. And since the U.S. News model doesnt track cost, the more the model is gamed, the more expensive colleges become. Over time the widespread gaming has led to outrageous tuitions, bloated administrations, and the death of the safety school, since high rejection rates are bad for rankings. The pool of high school kids hasnt changed, but the system is in an arms race of prestige.

More recent big data college algorithms work on an individual student basis. Inside the college, admissions offices use algorithms that weigh each student on likelihood of acceptance and financial aid requirements. Outside the college, professional consultants charge parents more than $25,000 to help their child get an offer from, say, NYU based on predictive algorithms. Again, an expensive arms race, and the victims are the lower- and middle-class students who cannot afford either college or the college-admissions process.

Information is power, and in the age of corporate surveillance, profiles on every active American consumer means that the system is slanted in favor of those with the data. This data helps build tailor-made profiles that can be used for or against someone in a given situation. Insurance companies, which historically sold car insurance based on driving records, have more recently started using such data-driven profiling methods. A Florida insurance company has been found to charge people with low credit scores and good driving records more than people with high credit scores and a drunk driving conviction. Its become standard practice for insurance companies to charge people not what they represent as a risk, but what they can get away with. The victims, of course, are those least likely to be able to afford the extra cost, but who need a car to get to work.

Not all gaming involving big data is so obvious. Sometimes what looks reasonable on the outside has an exploitative underbelly, and sometimes the gamers arent totally aware of their gaming. Consider online personality tests, which are required of more than 60 percent of prospective American workers. The tests themselves are hard to game: They ask questions that dont have obvious answers, and the prospective employees never learn their scores. And if job applicants fail the test, they never get called back for an interview.

Now consider the perspective of the employers who use such personality tests to filter their hires. The tests are cheap, and they save tons of money in human resource hires, but they are also almost entirely opaque. In other words, the personality test is treated as a money-saving black box, but its not clear what that black box is actually doing, and whether using it constitutes discriminatory hiring practices. Seven companies who used a personality test by the big data company Kronos are being sued for that reason; the lawsuit charges that the test constitutes a mental health exam, which is illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Big data profiling techniques are exploding in the world of politics. Its estimated that over $1 billion will be spent on digital political ads in this election cycle, almost 50 times as much as was spent in 2008; this field is a growing part of the budget for presidential as well as down-ticket races. Political campaigns build scoring systems on potential votersyour likelihood of voting for a given party, your stance on a given issue, and the extent to which you are persuadable on that issue. Its the ultimate example of asymmetric information, and the politicians can use what they know to manipulate your vote or your donation.

After the movie Wall Street came out in 1987, some people thought of Gordon Gekko as a villain, while others considered him a role model. The same dual promises exist in the current world of Big Data, where smart money armed with big data continually searches for opportunities to exploit dumb moneyincreasingly, individuals, swing voters, and even democracy itself. As long as the public trusts in the objectivity of statistical models, and as long as they remain intimidated by them, such opportunities will likely continue.

In 1954, Darrell Huff wrote a neat little book called How To Lie With Statistics, a how-to guide for marketers to mislead and manipulate people into believing just about anything with the right graphic and the well-placed stat. Computationally speaking, weve come a long way since 1954, but in one important way nothing has changed. Theres enormous opportunity for manipulation in big data, and we need to remain skeptical and vigilant. </TEXT>

Also, a fair amount of old people screw like bunnies.

Precies. Dat er geweld mag worden gebruikt, en zal worden gebruikt valt te verwachten. Dat er expliciet de instructie wordt gegeven dat de gijzelnemers liever dood dan levend eruit moeten komen is van een heel andere orde. Dan kom je in de sfeer van buitenrechtelijke executies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> De Stichting Vrienden van de PVV ontving vorig jaar ruim 108.000 dollar van het rechts-conservatieve David Horowitz Freedom Center (DHFC) uit Californi. Dat meldt het FD. Dat is flink meer dan het jaar daarvoor. In 2014 ontving de PVV een kleine 20.000 dollar van het Center.  
 
De donatie van 108.000 dollar werd aan het begin van 2015 in drie termijnen in de stichtingskas van Wilders gestort, zo blijkt nu uit de jaarrapportages van de politieke partijen. Die werden vrijdag openbaar gemaakt door het ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken. Giften van meer dan 4500 euro moeten door de partijen aan het ministerie worden gemeld.

<TEXT> I do understand the difference. We appear to be having a misunderstanding.

 Slack actually is free, as in beer. It is NOT free as in freedom because it is a closed source platform,

This is exactly the point I was trying to make. I don't care that Slack has a free tier, because that makes both options free to use. I do care that Slack is closed source, because that's where the difference lies, which is why I pointed it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is great news! It may indicate that it's more profitable for businesses not to use third-party ad networks which track and profile users and trade in their personally identifiable information.  
  
If this experiment graduates to becoming the norm, we can finally have a direct relationship with publishers as readers. Bad ads will be less common, which may end the need for an ad blocker from a security perspective. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Go and delete every single account you can think of that you don't need any more.

A better idea is to change the information in those accounts, then wait 6 to 12 months, and then delete them. LinkedIn for example ditches their archive of your old info after six months, updating it only with the newly entered stuff. If you take the patient approach you make sure your old info doesn't remain in their hands. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are handing Google an awful lot of power over you by giving them a comprehensive view of your life, your likes and dislikes, your travel patterns, your sleep-wake cycle, etc.  
  
They decide which news stories they make visible to you or hide from you in Google News, for example. They decide whether or not they show you a message asking for you to register to vote, or to go out and vote - or not. (It's something they're currently doing for the U.S. Presidential Election.)  
  
Without being fully aware of it, you are being influenced by them. And they are not being very transparent in how exactly they choose to show X or hide Y.    
  
You're also not just giving *your* data, but the data of all your contacts, people you have appointments with, etc. to Google as well. You choosing to use Google's services impacts other people's privacy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not a good comparison. A person has limited memory and eventually dies. Our data is forever, and will outlive even Google the company, as user/client data is generally auctioned off when companies go bust.  
  
Then there's the ease of access. Intelligence and security agencies can tap Google to track each and every user without their knowledge, something that you can't do with a person.  
  
And then there's the problem of hacking: You can't hack millions of human personal assistants at once.  
  
I would very much prefer a human over Google's version of a PA. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's good that you're still going to the gym. This gives you something to build on. Just be happy that you're doing it. Any progress is nice, but try not to get worked up about it if it's not happening right now.  
Make a list with a few things you feel you need to do today, tomorrow, this week, this month, etc. Assign yourself a fixed number of tasks for the week, and try to do at least one a day. Just look into it for five minutes, and you'll probably end up finishing that task for the day. If you succeed, congratulate yourself. If you don't, do not sink energy into beating yourself up about it. Instead, use that energy to start on a different task.  
  
The first obvious task is figuring out what you would need to do to apply to another school. Separate the need to learn how this works from the pressure you feel to actually do it. Knowing how to does not obligate you to do it.  
  
You do seem to be slipping into something of a depression. Feelings of shame can be caused or amplified by depression. Consider getting counseling to get your mind back on track. You're already exercising, so that's good. Consider looking into mindfulness. It's an effective strategy for dealing with stress and negative thoughts.  
  
As long as you have your mom as a safety net take advantage of the freedom that provides you to experiment, to broaden your horizons. Try as many things as you can. If you don't feel like going back to school, it's wise to try to discover what you would like to do instead. You don't have to find something that you think you will like forever, just try to find something that gives you some joy, inspiration or fulfillment right now. You will probably meet a few people along the way who will contribute to this process.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Goldman Sachs doesn't reach as directly into your life and mind as Facebook and Google do. Google and Facebook influence what information you have access to and how it is presented. They learn how you and people like you interact with said information, how it influences you, etc.  
They shape societies, as they partner with public institutions for research, city planning, healthcare, etc. They own large parts of our information infrastructure. And most people are carrying a surveillance device disguised as a phone, which runs Google Android, and one or more of Facebook's apps. And I've not even begun to scratch the surface of their reach.  
  
If you think Goldman Sachs has more influence on society than these companies do, you should really start reading up on them.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with your first sentiment, although I would formulate it as: "We've allowed these jackasses to become this powerful."  
  
Your solution may have worked in the late 00s, but now those companies have grown far beyond our individual control. You could try, but not using any of their services is impossible. Media have come to depend on Facebook for income (traffic). Healthcare services are partnering with Google for medical research based on patients' records. Cities are partnering with Google to track and manage real-world traffic. Facebook is still trying to become the network and closed web in developing countries, to rival the open internet. Google owns a significant chunk of the hardware infrastructure of the Internet (undersea cables, etc.). Google also provides many of the libraries used by most of the popular websites to function. And this list is just a mere glimpse. The majority of people with a smartphone are carrying an Android phone, Google's surveillance device that happens to be able to make phone calls and send 'private' messages.   
And even if we don't use their services, our family, friends, the businesses and services we interact with will all share data pertaining to us with them, allowing them to create shadow profiles of us.  
  
They've become so ubiquitous and ingrained into so many levels of society, there really is no escaping them. Yes we should act on a personal level, but we should not delude ourselves into thinking that that is all it takes. We will need to organize, we will need to push our representatives to take action, to regulate, to break those companies up.
  
Update: If you're wondering HOW we should organize, others have already begun that work. Start by supporting some of these organizations with your time and/or money:  
  
- [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org/) (USA)  
- [European Digital Rights (EDRi)](https://edri.org/) (Europe)  
- [Open Rights Group](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/) (UK)  
- [American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)](https://aclu.org/) (USA)  
- [Digitale Gesellschaft](https://digitalegesellschaft.de/) (DE)  
  
If you're looking for one in your own country, this list is a good place to start: https://edri.org/about/#members  
  
And spread the word! </TEXT>

<TEXT> ### Submission Statement

Google and Facebook now actively influence so many aspects of billions of peoples' lives, and entire societies. They influence what we (don't) think about and how we think about it.  
The've become gatekeepers to our media, arbiters of our speech, and much more. The words we currently use to describe those companies fail to capture their reach and power.  
  
 Characterizing Facebook or Google as powerful media organs  even the most powerful  actually understates their power. Marshall McLuhan, 60 years ago, gave us another, fuller understanding of media. Electric light is a medium totally radical, pervasive, and decentralized that appears to us as media only when constituted into video content. Electrical current itself completely changes our relationship to the world and, in the process, reconstitutes us. A medium is not merely something that feeds us content. It is a condition like air or water, through which we move without noticing.  
  
The analogy captures part of what is happening, but goes even further. Facebook and Google are not only carrying us, but constituting us. We are, in fact, their media. Geared as they are to sharing, clicking and eyeballs, these media do not measure and do not value solitary contemplation, reflection and disconnection. They thrive and pulse on popularity, not veracity. They feed on extremes, not common causes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Politicians who react to terrorism by undermining civil liberties are ensuring that terrorism works. If they were smart enough and brave enough, they would defend our open and free societies. They would resist this dark urge to create the tools necessary for a police state. Now, they are putting us all at risk of a much greater danger than terrorism carried out by Muslim extremists. </TEXT>

The good news for Nvidia GPU owners, such as it is, is that while GeForce experience is convenient and centralized, its not actually mandatory to use. You can still download drivers directly from the website, choose optimal game performance settings using in-game menus, and set display settings using Windows options.

<TEXT> Je gaat er vanuit dat geen bezwaar aantekenen altijd bewust is. Er zijn mensen die niet kunnen lezen, mensen die de post negeren, mensen die niet in de zorgmolen zitten maar technisch gezien wel wilsonbekwaam zijn, er zijn mensen die de taal niet spreken.  
Daar valt allemaal wel wat aan te doen, maar je zult ze nooit allemaal bereiken. Voordat we bezwaar maken, voordat we een keuze maken, en zelfs als we geen keuze maken, wordt er voor ons bepaald dat we geen bezwaar maken en dus mogelijk beschikbaar zijn als donor. *Als* er nabestaanden zijn dan kunnen die mogelijk nog een afweging maken, ja, maar dat doet niets af aan dat er eerst voor ons beslist wordt.  
  
Het probleem had ook opgelost kunnen worden door ons te dwingen te kiezen, niet door voor ons te kiezen. Dat was ook een beperking geweest van onze vrijheid, maar niet een beperking van onze grondrechten. </TEXT>

Met grote moeite kun je nog wel proberen om een zaak voor te laten komen bij het Europese Hof voor de Mensenrechten, maar dat duurt vele jaren en kost veel geld.

Mijn lichaam is van mij, ik beslis wat er mee gebeurt. Een wetsvoorstel waarin we tot een keuze gedwongen zouden worden zou al op de rand zijn, wat mij betreft, maar in ieder geval te prefereren boven dit wetsvoorstel.  
  
Als dit doorgaat staat mijn lichaam dus in eerste instantie ter beschikking van de staat, nog voordat ik mijn mening heb kunnen geven en zelfs als ik mijn mening helemaal niet geef.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just adding the last two paragraphs here:

Another hot button is whether so-called lawful access rules, which require telecommunications firms to allow police to install wiretaps, should be expanded to tech firms. It isnt clear if the EUs proposals would include such a change, but the possibility raises the specter of renewed fighting over whether tech firms should be forced to build in back doors to encrypted services, both telecom and tech lobbyists say.

Theres a lot of money that operators invest in data access for authorities, said one telecommunications executive. It should be same services, same obligations. </TEXT>

Generally speaking, we don't like abuse of power by police, or being policed at all, and we don't like being filmed. There is no comfortable position to take on the body cam issue.

But the real reason is probably that I've only submitted this 36 minutes ago, and it has 2 points. Not enough people have seen this for the comment panel to reflect most points of view. </TEXT>

1. U.S. presidents get to make a list of people to pardon on their last day in office.

<TEXT> Snowden's lawyer, someone who would know, disagrees:

The biopics September release date matches up with Wizners timetable for mobilizing a clemency appeal to Obama. Were going to make a very strong case between now and the end of this administration that this is one of those rare cases for which the pardon power exists, Wizner said. Its not for when somebody didnt break the law. Its for when they did and there are extraordinary reasons for not enforcing the law against the person.

<TEXT> Welcome to the sub! And thank you for the compliments.  

As far as I'm concerned both groups as described by you are welcome here, but because we don't focus on general privacy-related content, you probably won't find a lot of discussions about Tails here.
You are more likely to find news stories about drafting of surveillance or data-protection laws, abuse of surveillance powers, data breaches, surveillance capitalism, etc.

I'm looking forward to anything else you decide to contribute to our sub. And good luck tomorrow! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Congratulations everyone! We've hit the 1000 subscribers mark, with 10% of you joining in the past 24 hours. Thank you for your contributions. And I would like to thank /u/must_warn_others, /u/TonyQuark, /u/kulkke, and /u/fantastic_comment for their help in making /r/europrivacy what it is today.  
  
**How we got here**

About seven months ago, I decided to see if I could grow /r/europrivacy into a relevant sub for news and discussion about privacy issues related to European countries and the European Union. Before then I hadn't put much of a consistent effort into growing this sub.  

I gave the sub a new look, cleaned up the sidebar, and started submitting content every day. I invited a few others who were active around the same subjects to submit their links here as well.  
You can [see the difference in the stats](https://imgur.com/a/oxdT6) between the time before and after my decision. It's nice to see the hard work paying off. And it's great to know that so many Redditors care about privacy issues and how they relate to Europe.
  

  
**Where we're going**

- We will be submitting ads to /r/subredditads which, if we're selected, will run in the sidebar across Reddit.
- We will be reaching out to more regular contributors to other subreddits like /r/privacy, /r/technology, and /r/europe and ask them to submit here as well.
- We will be reaching out to journalists, activists, and other professionals in the privacy sphere to come submit their work here and interact with you, our subscribers. Hopefully we will become one of the hubs for privacy-related discourse in Europe.  
  

**What you can do**

You can help with making our content more diverse. We are an English-language sub, and as such a majority of the news shared here covers the United Kingdom and the European Union. We would appreciate it very much if we could get contributors from each European country submitting (translated) news about privacy issues in their country. Switzerland is drawing up a new surveillance bill, for example. We would love to know more about that.
You can submit an article in the original language, but with an English title and an English translation in a comment.

Apart from that, we'd like to encourage you to submit your questions and engage in discussion. That's what we're here for!

**Please share any suggestions and criticisms in the comments. We would love to know how we can make this sub better for and with you.**

We're confident that, with your help, we can hit the 2000 subscribers mark sooner rather than later :)

**Thanks again!** </TEXT>

According to a recent KPMG survey of more than 2,000 people, 46% of adults in the UK said they would block ads because they do not like adverts at all. The report also found that more than 40% said adverts lacked relevance, while **34% said misuse of personal data was an issue**.  
  
Source: http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-awareness/adblocker-use-on-the-rise-finds-study/
  
Then there's the security issue with ad networks being compromised and serving up malicious ads. The motives behind using ad blockers can not be reduced to annoyance only.    
  
I want to pay for what I consume, but I run into several problems:  
  
- The publication runs on an ad-only or similar business model, with no room for actual payment with money by the reader  
- If it does provide a way for me to pay, it is usually for a subscription, and not per-article  
- Even if I do pay, they continue to track me, and sometimes continue to serve ads  
- There are no anonymous payment options, which is a problem for any online business, not just media
  
I've been using Blendle for a while now, paying per article as I go. But I decide against reading a fair amount of articles, because I don't want that in stored in the reading history that's connected to my 'real' identity. Even if I were to trust Blendle right now, I don't know what they will do with the data tomorrow. It is not uncommon for businesses that go bust to have the customer data auctioned off to the highest bidder. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  To enjoy the beauty of the world per internet.

This is a possible use of Street View, but I don't believe it is Google's intended use. Google is a for-profit company. Creating or sharing beauty isn't their primary goal. Their primary goal is to make money from or off of us.  
  
I believe the primary goal of Street View is knowing our surroundings, how we interact with our surroundings, and knowing our travel patterns. With this knowledge they wish to improve their advertising business, by improving targeted advertising.  
  
Google is an advertising business. Every single product is built to benefit that business. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as I know, blurring out of privately-owned houses by personal request is only done in Germany, not Europe-wide. When someone moves into a house obscured in Street View at the request of the previous owner, they could put in a request to not obscure the house in the next update. Street View isn't static. Street View cars, cyclists and walkers roam our streets regularly.  
  
'Collateral blurring' that occurs in the process of blurring out faces and number plates is Google's responsibility, not 'Europe's'. It is Google's automated process that produces these flaws in their product, not EU or national regulations.  
  
I believe member states have already been very friendly toward Google's Street View product. Local and national governments share enormous amounts of data with Google; Land registry, traffic, etc. and of course the permission to catalog and digitize our public space, our property, and us. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  the presence of large numbers of Muslims in Western Europe that are hostile to or incompatible with European civilization
  
You're grossly oversimplifying. A non-trivial amount of attackers so far were petty criminals, or unstable folk who converted to radical Islam shortly before their attacks.  
Their socio-economic situation, lack of proper healthcare, decades worth of poor integration policies, etc. are creating a fertile breeding ground for extremist sympathizers.  
  
A ban on e2e encrypted messaging will only stop law-abiding citizens from using them. Organizations such as IS can just write their own app, run their own servers or decentralized service, and can deploy its own encryption.  
Furthermore, encryption is necessary to protect the rights *and safety* of our citizens. Any ban or mandated backdoor would be foolish. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The more peaceful the world becomes, the more we will notice violent events.

This goes alongside the changes to our news cycle. In the (distant) past, we wouldn't have learned about attacks in real time. Or only in a short update on the hour. Usually it was the morning after, when the morning paper hit your doorstep. By that time, most of your questions would have been answered, and the event would be presented with a context.  
  
Now, we hear about events instantly. No answers, no context, just questions and uncertainty. For hours. During those hours we are left to imagine the most horrible things. People fill the void with their imagination, or the imagination of others. Or rumor and opinions of people trying to use the uncertainty to their benefit.  
  
By the time vital facts roll in, you're already shocked and saturated. And because the facts and context aren't presented at the moment you learn of an attack, you are less likely to spend time consuming the facts. Especially because the next Sensational Event pops up into your news and social feeds.

Or at least, that's the rough theory knocking about in my head. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  A business running Windows 10 can set up their own security policies though, right? The data collection is most likely going to be an issue for your everyday consumer, not a business.

Exactly, so the users with the least power are getting screwed the most.

If you are choosing to give away your data, you are choosing to give up your rights, just like if I allow the police into my house without a warrant.

No, I don't. Businesses are subject to data protection laws. Any identifiable data they collect - and almost any data is (re)identifiable, they are obligated to protect.

 good luck relying on the government to efficiently protect you

It's not my only strategy, but it is one of them. I do what I can to protect myself, while helping the government to better protect us.   Through successful lobbying and campaigning we've managed to get a pretty decent [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) in the EU, which goes into effect next year. Similar regulations in different sectors have lead to similar laws in other countries. I'm confident it will impact U.S. regulations in a positive manner in the decade to come. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a lot of problems with that belief, some of which I'll address.

1) Humans have the Human Right to Privacy. No EULA can take that away from them.  
2) Different countries, different cultures, different laws. What may be seen as acceptable in the U.S., where anti-government sentiments are more common than in France, may not be viewed the same in countries such as France.  
3) Microsoft's primary customers for Windows - the ones who are actually paying for this - are businesses. They buy the operating system in bulk, slap it on their corporate devices, and their staff uses it. Individual, private persons are almost inconsequential to Microsoft, and they won't notice you not giving them your business. This is also why several opt-outs are only available for the more expensive, business versions of the OS.  
4) Individuals don't have the power to protect their human and constitutional rights from multinationals. Especially in societies that are less litigational than the U.S.. And especially for users who don't live in the same country as the HQ of the multinational.  
5) The majority of the users don't understand or aren't aware of any privacy infringements, let alone how they work and why it is a threat to their privacy. They just see "free upgrade", or they buy a laptop that looks nice or is cheapest. We've given the power to our governments to sometimes protect those who can't protect themselves. </TEXT>

- People who use opt-out services, like:

 - "Use a prediction service to load pages more quickly"
 - "Automatically report details of possible security incidents to Google"
 - "Protect you and your device from dangerous sites"
 - "Automatically send usage statistics and crash reports to Google"

Or are they collecting this data from _everyone_ who uses Chrome, even those who take care to opt out of the above-listed services? </TEXT>

One canary. We only know that something is happening which we don't know anything about. Warrant canaries only cover National Security Letters. We don't know anything about all other avenues. Now that the canary is dead, we won't know about any future NSLs either.

One diplomat said the countries that abstained from the vote would be extremely vigilant during the review.

This is not just going to be a box-ticking exercise, this is going to be a very detailed and in-depth review. Only adjustments from the review can save this from the ECJ, the diplomat said.

That is a very big if. It already is tied to identity through users' IP addressess, e-mail addresses, etc. Not everyone uses disposable e-mails, pseudonyms, VPNs or Tor. And people may use the same username across a variety of sites and services.  
  
We know that Reddit collects this information. What we don't know is how they will use this information in the future. Will they auction it off when they go bankrupt? Will they sell it to companies that combine data sets to (re)identify and profile people for targeting in marketing campaigns? Will they give access to law enforcement? Will Reddit be compromised and the be data copied? These are just a few examples.

<TEXT> You are already sharing your data with a U.S. corporation right now: Reddit, Inc. Have you watched a YouTube video or used Google search lately? Bingo. Do you have a Facebook account? Do you use LinkedIn, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Android, any Apple device?  
  
Before the Privacy* Shield there was the Safe Harbour agreement.  The principles of this agreement were designed to prevent private organizations within the European Union or United States which store customer data from accidentally disclosing or losing personal information.  
  
The agreement was struck down by the European Court of Justice, because: "legislation permitting the public authorities to have access on a generalised basis to the content of electronic communications must be regarded as compromising the essence of the fundamental right to respect for private life"  
  
Suddenly, there was no legal way for U.S. companies to collect, transmit, or use data from people within the EU. Which is why negotiations started to create the Privacy Shield.  
  
The Privacy Shield is flawed, so it probably won't live long:  
  
Conclusions. Given the flawed premises  trying to fix data protection deficit in the U.S. by means of the Obama Administrations assurances as opposed to meaningful legislative reform  it is not surprising that the new Privacy Shield remains full of holes and offers limited protections.  
  
The coming days will likely see the adoption of this flawed text by the EU, but it is unlikely to be the final chapter of the EU-US data transfer saga. Because it fails to address the concerns expressed by the Court of Justice of the EU in the Schrems case last year, the new Privacy Shield is likely to be challenged in courts.

<TEXT> I don't know the greater why, and I hope someone will take the time to explain it. What I do know is that this agreement only needs the go-ahead from the EU member states. Any resolution by the European Parliament would be non-binding.  
  
And they have done just that. You can find the resolution [here](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION reference=P8-RC-2016-0623 language=EN) and the press release [here](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160524IPR28820/EU-US-%E2%80%9CPrivacy-Shield%E2%80%9D-for-data-transfers-further-improvements-needed-MEPs-say).

No. I could maybe get myself to be a little less angry and disappointed, though.  
  
I confirmed that it does not work as expected. I know I disabled tracking yesterday at work, and now clicked an article and found it used out.reddit.com tracking. Yet the other options I changed were retained. It's broken either by design or incompetence, so fuck 'em.  
  
Instead of lowering it, I'm going to go ahead and up my level anger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There actually is something to gain. I oppose this course of action, but they track your clicks to sort the content to suit your tastes. They want to create a happy little filter bubble for you.  
We've learned from Google and Facebook that users generally enjoy personalized environments.  
  
I wouldn't opt-in to that, because I'm very privacy-conscious. This also makes me highly aware of how many people are not, and how they prefer ease of use over pretty much anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. We already had more privacy. Thanks to this move we have less of it on Reddit. The opt-out is a pacifier. It serves only to give you the illusion of choice. Most users will never be aware of this change, or that the opt-out exists.

<TEXT> Reddit, Inc. used to care about things like transparency and user privacy. You are looking at it from the outside, with a perspective influenced by how fucked up everyone else is.  
We are looking at it from a different perspective. We are worried about Reddit betraying values that brought and kept us here. *Two* of them, the transparency and user privacy I mentioned, are being violated by this action.  
Of all Reddit users, few will know /r/changelog exists. Some will see this post or similar ones on other subreddits. The majority of users won't know that Reddit has slid yet another few feet down the slippery slope of /r/privacy infringement.  
Those of us who do know can inform others, we can protest these actions, and we can prepare ourselves to try to stop Reddit from slipping further.  
We've got to take a /r/Stand some time and somewhere; It might as well be* now, and it might as well be Reddit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mother Jones' Shane Bauer went undercover as a security guard in a private prison in the U.S.:

[My Four Months as a Private Prison Guard](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/cca-executive-summary).

It's 35,000 words in total. Don't despair, there's a summary of his key findings: [Inside Shane Bauer's Gripping Look at the Workings of a Private Prison](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/cca-executive-summary)

Margaret Sullivan, former public editor of The New York Times and now media columnist for WaPo, dedicated a column to the ethical problems that come with going undercover: [How Mother Jones went undercover to reveal ugly truths about for-profit prisons](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/how-mother-jones-went-undercover-to-reveal-ugly-truths-about-for-profit-prisons/2016/07/03/014cafb2-3e0c-11e6-80bc-d06711fd2125_story.html?postshare=3091467585119747 tid=ss_tw)

This reminded me of a not so recent piece by MoJo: [I Was a Warehouse Wage Slave: My brief, backbreaking, rage-inducing, low-paying, dildo-packing time inside the online-shipping machine.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/mac-mcclelland-free-online-shipping-warehouses-labor) </TEXT>

That's a good idea.

Bits of Freedom built a tool called 'Privacy Inzage Machine' or [PIM](https://pim.bof.nl/) years ago, which helps people exercise that right in The Netherlands. It's lead to a few stories in the press over the years.

Rejo Zenger exercised the same right many times and wrote [several accounts](https://rejo.zenger.nl/tag/inzageverzoek/) based on the information he received. He later joined Bits of Freedom.

<TEXT> I tried to start one here on Reddit. It didn't exactly take off straight away. If there are people here who'd like to try again, I'm willing to help.

Currently, I have the following subs registered:

- /r/JournalismReview (that's the one I tried to get off the ground)
- /r/JournalismSchool
- /r/SchoolOfJournalism

For some reason I have it in my head that a Reddit School of Journalism would be a fun community to have, especially as so many of the popular subs revolve around news. Media literacy is something many Redditors could use some help with...

<TEXT> There's a fourth downside to Whatsapp: You won't be able to see if/when they switch off e2e encryption on their side. You're essentially trusting them on their word that your conversations are encrypted.

Keeping that in mind, they do encrypt by default with a vetted protocol. For that reason, I would recommend it over Telegram for casual users.

Also, there's no reason why your audience can't install both WhatsApp and Signal, and just use what they can with whom they can. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Niks is onvermijdelijk.

Het zou inderdaad fijn zijn als jongeren weer meer gaan stemmen, maar omdat zij zich niet naar de stembus kunnen bewegen hoeven we toch niet het stemproces, en daarmee onze parlementaire democratie, op het spel te zetten?  

Digitaal stemmen tellen - offline - is al problematisch vergeleken met het proces wat we nu hebben. Niemand kan van buiten zien of de software in de telmachine betrouwbaar is. Om het te checken, moet je alsnog alles met de hand tellen.

Zodra we ons stemproces aan het internet hangen, vergroten we het aanvalsoppervlak tot het absolute; wil je het stemproces beinvloeden, dan hoef je als China, Rusland, of private partij niet meer een leger mannetjes en busjes op pad te sturen met nagemaakte stembiljetten. Je hoeft enkel een legertje hackers in te schakelen, die je al in dienst hebt, of kunt huren.
 Die hackers kunnen dan vanuit hun luie stoel, van over de hele wereld, het online stemsysteem benaderen.

Dan is er nog de insider threat. Iemand die bij de fabrikant werkt, binnenglipt, of daar de systemen weet te hacken, en zo hun invloed weten uit te oefenen.

Vrijwel iedereen kan met het blote oog controleren of de zaken gaan zoals ze moeten gaan in het stemlokaal. Er is zeer specialistische kennis en bijzondere toegang nodig om hetzelfde niveau van controle en transparantie te krijgen bij online stemmen.

En dit is nog maar een fractie van de problemen met online stemmen. Om een idee te krijgen van de vooralsnog onopgeloste problemen die er bestaan, raad ik je aan deze videos te bekijken:

- [Internet Voting? Really? | Andrew Appel | TEDxPrincetonU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abQCqIbBBeM)
- [Barbara Simons: I can bank online, why can't I vote online?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv3VuGZzdK8)
- [Security Analysis of Estonia's Internet Voting System [31c3] by J. Alex Halderman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY_pHvhE4os)

Het is wel mogelijk om iets anders te doen met internet om jongeren naar de stembus te krijgen. En manier voor de burger om zich meer betrokken te voelen de politiek is lid te worden van een partij. Politieke partijen en (toekomstige) leden moeten elkaar online gaan vinden.  Klinkt ouderwets, partijlidmaatschap, maar *daarmee* kun je invloed uitoefenen. *Daarmee* heb je de kans dat jouw standpunt daadwerkelijk in het partijprogramma terecht komt. En dan wordt de drempel om te gaan stemmen vanzelf lager, en de democratie juist robuuster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't believe he has a clear political agenda. He is one reporter, covering one beat, and yes, he's being kind of one-sided, which is something that can happen when you specialize in covering a subject.

There should be a balance in the reporting on Al Jazeera, by having him *or other* reporters covering other aspects of the same beat.

I don't see a clear political agenda, and I don't see a clear political purpose. He's reporting on the experiences of migrants and refugees, which is generally under-reported, where the problems stemming from migration are generally over-reported.

Bias, sure, I could give you that one. And if he's the only one reporting on this subject, then AJ has a problem with one-sided coverage. Still, I don't see activism. These are not opinion pieces, he's not covering the migrants as great heroes while vilifying all who stand in their way. He's pretty even-handed within the narrow focus. </TEXT>

Reporter, covering migration-integration issues in Europe.

Migration is his beat as a reporter. Unless you can provide hard proof that he is *also* a "pro-migrant activist", you're engaging in slander. </TEXT>

Like actual fingerprints, the digital "noise" in original images is stochastic in nature  that is, it contains random variables  which are inevitably created during the manufacturing process of the camera and its sensors. This virtually ensures that the noise imposed on the digital images from any particular camera will be consistent from one image to the next, even while it is distinctly different.

<TEXT> ###Submission Statement  
  
Every day I encounter people on Reddit and other platforms that still believe refugees are primarily to blame for the events on New Years Eve in Cologne, Germany. They use this account to justify their hostile stance against refugees. 
  
De Correspondent, a Dutch journalism startup, set upon a months-long investigation to separate fact from fiction.  
The result is the story I've submitted, [and this minute-by-minute timeline.](https://decorrespondent.nl/4406/Minute-by-minute-This-is-what-happened-in-Cologne-on-New-Years-Eve/1078757391184-66dd7a56)  
  
Unfounded statements made by police in the days after became headlines, while the truth has taken months to surface, only to be ignored.  
I hope the actual account of what happened that night will spread far and wide. </TEXT>

My opinion:  
  
Yes, generally speaking. It differs a little from country to country, but personal privacy is definitely better protected in most compared to the U.S.  
  
Companies are a lot more restricted in what they can collect and do with the data they collect. The government tends to collect as much or more, as most European countries tend to have something of a welfare state.  
And of course we suffer from the same terrorism scare, so more and more systems and laws are being implemented to surveil us. 
  
A lot will improve as of 25 May, 2018 when the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) will go into force. It's a much-needed update for the information age, giving people who reside in the EU a say in who collects their information, for what purpose, etc. And they can request a copy of whatever data any company holds on them. This, for example, is a right that does not exist in the U.S.  
  
No country is perfect, but Germany is a good bet if you value privacy. They have a constitutional court that keeps both German lawmakers and European lawmakers in check.  
Belgium has increasingly become better at it; They even have a State Secretary of Privacy! The Netherlands is alright on paper, less so in practice, but civil society (privacy activists) are organized and working on keeping the government honest.  
  
I'm not sure about the Nordics, but I know Sweden, for example, publishes everyone's tax records. Your neighbors could check how much you make, etc.  
I would stay away from France, as they've gone all-in on anti-terrorism for obvious reasons. The declared a state of emergency after the last attacks in Paris and have extended it until after the European Football Championship ends, which they are hosting right now.  
  
If you could tell us which specific country or countries you have in mind, it would be easier to give you more specific advice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 'Obama' is shorthand for his administration. He doesn't set the agenda alone, but he does bear the ultimate responsibility for it. I don't believe there is much hard evidence out there of Obama deliberately instructing people to directly target individual leakers/whistleblowers. It is clear that his administration is behaving extraordinary compared to all its predecessors in how it deals with leakers/whistleblowers.

The 'War on Whistleblowers' exists, but it is part of a larger agenda, that includes a war on *unauthorized* leaks to the press, and an attack on source protection by journalists.

[This chart by ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/special/sealing-loose-lips-charting-obamas-crackdown-on-national-security-leaks) which ends at the conviction of Bradley/Chelsea Manning, shows how leak prosecutions under the Espionage Act have picked up steam under Obama. 

The lede of this Guardian piece, detailing a double standard in dealing with leakers/whistleblowers, may make the distinction between President Obama and his administration more clear (emphasis mine):

Since Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009, *his government* has waged a war against whistleblowers and official leakers. *On his watch*, there have been eight prosecutions under the 1917 Espionage Act  more than double those under all previous presidents combined.

Source: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/16/whistleblowers-double-standard-obama-david-petraeus-chelsea-manning

During Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, he/his campaign boasted about prosecuting "twice as many cases under the Espionage Act as all other administrations combined".

Source: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/obama-campaign-brags-about-whistleblower-persecutions

A very different message from his 2008 campaign:

Protect Whistleblowers: Often the best source of information about waste, fraud, and abuse in government is an existing government employee committed to public integrity and willing to speak out. Such acts of courage and patriotism, which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should be encouraged rather than stifled as they have been during the Bush administration. We need to empower federal employees as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance. Barack Obama will strengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in government. Obama will ensure that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process.

President Obama is cracking down on leakers. Both Edward Snowden and Bradley Manning face prosecution under the Espionage Act, while a New York Times reporter was ordered to reveal his sources or risk jail time. Is Washington turning its back on freedom of the press?

- [**Silenced: The War on Whistleblowers**](http://silencedfilm.com/), which is available on Netflix in some countries.

<TEXT> Apathy and laziness aren't enough to explain it. Using that as an explanation doesn't really invite us to look into actual or other causes.

The benefits of surveillance capitalism are clear to even the simplest of people, while the dangers are* not. Humans are great with immediate feedback and gratification, and terrible with delayed feedback and gratification. Even more so if the negative effects of their behavior affects others, and not them.

And even that explanation is too limited, so I'll keep looking for others and better ones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Clueless? I think she's being very deliberate. Never waste a good crisis to push for more surveillance powers, and to quell the post-Snowden emergence of anti-surveillance sentiments in Silicon Valley. SV is very susceptible to pro-LGBTQ rhetoric, and may throw encryption under the bus because of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a man in Amsterdam who slept in a different hotel every night for a year. He paid for this himself at first, but as the ball got rolling, his presence became a valuable way to get good PR - journalists covered his experiences and he kept a blog - so they either comped the room, upgraded his room, or allowed him a taste of the extras.
It probably cost him somewhere between 2000 and 4000 a month just for the rooms, depending on the season.

If you want to figure out if you can pull off living in just one hotel, contact the hotels in the city you're looking at, at the locations you're looking at, and ask them the rates for long-term stay, including internet access (which isn't usually free or unlimited). 
Then figure out how much it would cost you to eat out 3 times a day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are apartment buildings adjacent to hotels that give access to the hotel's services, including the ones you've mentioned. Unfortunately, those apartments go for tens of millions of dollars/euros, and the service comes at a high price as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing with security and privacy is that you don't get to decide whether you're special or not. Others don't judge you by your standards.
You, your knowledge, your access, or your social or professional contacts may make you a person of interest to someone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That entirely depends on the country/jurisdiction you're in. Several countries have something called a 'decryption order', compelling you to disclose your password or key. If you decline, you get jail time.  
  
They can't force you in the same way they can forcefully take biometric information from you, but they can try to force you by pressuring you. </TEXT>
