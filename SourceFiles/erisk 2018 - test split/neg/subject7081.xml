Dr Who, Girl Scout Cookie, Citrix, Acapulco Gold, Lemon Skunk, LA Woman or AK-47 for daytime use. God Bud, OG Kush, Jedi Ace or Dark Star for evening/bedtime. 

I am always looking to expand the list. I hate when I go in and they have none of my favorites.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1st things 1st

I am down 14lbs since December 

Started at 323

Last weigh in I am 309

Next goal: 50lb loss so I can go horseback riding!

This has genuinely been a new year, new me in a lot of ways. I started a new job, in a completely new field as a paraeducator  (read teachers aide) and have used it as a springboard to make changes.

I am walking a lot more. My campus is small, but an open, outdoor Southwest campus that I walk across several times a day. I also monitor meal times and recess. I make sure my time "standing" is spent pacing or doing step-touch to keep moving. According to my Fitbit I have 8000 steps in before I leave work at 2:30pm.

I also am stuck on campus for lunch. No running to McDonald's or Culvers as was my usual. I am in a small town, no fast food, and I don't really have time to go off campus anyway. I pack a light lunch of yogurt, berries, fruit, and maybe a granola bar. I also don't take soda to work, so it water only. I nurse a 12oz  Pepsi with dinner instead of drinking 2 giant gas station sodas or more daily. I generally eat the same as before for dinner, but control my portions. I track every calorie on my Fitbit app and even on "cheat" days stay under my weekly calories.

It feels like life change, not a diet. Especially since I have not really made the really big, sweeping changes like big calorie restrictions or overly ambitious workout goals like I would usually do, then burn out and fail. I am amazed that these small, relatively painless changes have let to such dramatic progress!

I feel super excited to be off to such a great start. I am more excited to have just as much good news to report in the months to come.

<TEXT> This is the same principle that makes small dog bites dangerous. A tiny toy poodle bit me once during grooming. I went right to the Doctor, got it scrubbed up and antibiotics started. 
Woke up the next morning with puss pouring out of my hand. I was rushed to the hospital and had emergency surgery to open my hand and clean out all the infection. The 1st 24hrs I had the wound flushed every few hours while they pumped in pain meds and I vomited.
 This was followed by 7 days in isolation in the hospital with the CDC monitoring me because of all the crazy bacteria that had sprouted in my hand.
18 yeats later my right index  finger is more scar tissue than anything.
TL;DR don't fuck around with bites from small animals. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Working up an Old West campaign </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-06 01:25:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have some interest in running a Gunfighter/Wild West campaign based in Tombstone. It will be partially online (Roll20) and partially tabletop. 

I am in Tombstone and have interest from locals to play. I think the novelty of the game being live from Tombstone will be fun for online players. 

I have been modifying Pathfinder to accommodate. Anyone run a Western campaign have any advice?

EDIT
A little more info. The campaign will be based in 1881 Tombstone. NPCs will be historical figures like Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday etc. Full of poker games, gunfights, bar brawls, cattle drives and the like. It will be a mix of ongoing campaign for the regulars and one-shot adventures for drop in players

<TEXT> My husband and I are obese. We have talked for ever about getting healthy. The usual "this is the year" bullshit.
He has surgery on his spine to repair slipped and ruptured discs. Now has to be the year. His recovery and future health depend on it in a very real way.
What is your best, most down to earth and practical advice to get on this journey?
I need simple steps, simple changes, and it needs to start with nutrition since he can't even really walk for about 6 weeks.
Thanks, guys. This fat girl puts our fat asses in your capable hands. (Metaphorically, of course. Our fat asses could never fit in your actual hands) </TEXT>

<TEXT> We adopted him. We just got super lucky that he was inclined like that. I ordered the training books to work with him through [Top Dog] (http://www.topdogusa.org/) and trained him myself. Like I said, he is not a formally trained service dog and I don't take him anywhere non-service dogs can't go. He is a lifesaver, though. If you are only wanting the behaviors, not necessarily the "take your dog anywhere" aspect I highly recommend self training through the Top Dog books. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We got a dog shortly after my SAD got debilitating. Mal has been a godsend. He naturally took to me and has a lot of calming behaviors. I had worked in the pet care industry for 15 yrs so did research on anxiety service animal behaviors. He knows when I am having anxiety issues and is glued to me. He comforts me by licking my arm and wanting petted or trying to get me to play. If someone is making me anxious he places himself between us. Working on training him was great for me and him. He is registered through my Psych Dr as a Service Animal, as he meets the assistive behavior requirements but he is WAY to friendly to take him to stores and restaurants. We had him registered mostly so if I ever move I can have him with, I only take him places where non-service dogs are allowed. He helps me so much, and goes with me as much as possible. I don't want to give "properly trained" Service Animals a bad name by being "that guy". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I can expand on what /u/Mr_Romeo said. In my own writing, I tend to view my 1st draft as "word vomit". I want to get the story out and onto the page as quickly as possible, and the mechanics are not worked out.It is rambling, too flowery and descriptive, and a little confusing to anyone not in my head. I feel like this is where you are with this work. 

When you go back to edit, it needs tightened up. Less unnecessary description and adjectives. I personally use [Hemmingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/beta/index.html) for this. You need to fine tune the character interaction to make it flow better. The dialogue seems stiff and forced. These are typical 1st draft issues, for me at least, and it seems for you as well. I hope this is more clear. 

Keep writing! </TEXT>

I found that many of my spiritual practices (i.e. meditation, herbalism, grounding and centering etc.) are really helpful tools to getting my attacks under control. If you have anxiety issues going in, I would maybe concentrate on these more "soothing" aspects to get started. Blessings to you on your GAD and your Path. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All my daughter wanted for her birthday was to go horse back riding. I was well over the weight limit, and an adult had to go along with her for the trail ride. Having to tell my daughter I couldn't take her riding was devastating. She took it pretty well and we went to the movies instead, but it broke my heart. 

I let myself do Thanksgiving, then started the next day. Got a FitBit and started counting calories and steps. I am only just getting rolling, but it feels different this time. It's not for me, and not just to look better. I am honestly doing this for my kids.

<TEXT> When I found out my husband cheated I told him I could not afford to throw him out. I told him I was done and our marriage was over, we just were living in the same house. I told him there was a tiny chance our marriage could be saved. He had until I could afford to take care of the kids on my own to convince me to let him stay. In the following six months he completely turned himself inside out to fix our marriage. 

After that 6 months, I agreed that we could work it out. We did counseling, and a LOT of very serious and painful talks. We did a the work and have come out ok. That was 5 years ago. I would tell anyone in that situation to only stay after a spouse has cheated if

a)The cheater can honestly commit to the amount of shit required to fix that kind of fuck-up. It's a big job and not everyone is up to it.

b)You can honestly commit to the amount of shit you have to wade through to work through it. Again, not for everyone and there is no shame in not wanting to walk that path.

c)You can find some way to live with it. It will always be there in your brain and will pop up and punch you in the throat at weird times.

Even though we are good, and possibly better, now, I wonder what would have happened it I would have had a better job when it all went down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  They may NEED something for an important event etc.

A customers lack of planning is not a retail workers emergency. If you needed something "for an event" you should have planned better. Everyone has emergencies, but it is unreasonable to expect someone making minimum wage to put themselves in a potentially dangerous situation to solve it

I have no illusions of getting rich from my work, but it would be nice to make enough to have to claim it on my taxes. That is just somehow a validation of it being my official career to me if I made enough to make it taxable income. It's exciting and terrifying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You just have to be willing to be with your kids, as in within like 10 ft, for a large part of the time. When it rains...those are long days, but it works for us and actually cuts down on a lot of stress. We own our home, no one can take that away, and we have found out how little we need to be happy. If you are going to try it, start getting your kids in a "place for everything and everything in it's place" mindset and habit now, it will save you a lot of frustration.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My kids are 9 and about to turn 5. The 6 months were at an RV park with other kids and a nice clubhouse for them to hang out in. Even now they are pretty much outside unless they are sleeping or getting their "screen time". We moved into it out of necessity when my husband got a job in another town and we had to move quickly to take advantage of it. We moved into a house, and honestly missed the Vardo (which is what we call the RV) The girls tell me they miss living in the Vardo pretty often and are there with us every step of the renovation. 

When we moved back we decided to live with my Mom and Stepdad while we renovate and find some land, although the communal living with my parents situation is working well for us and we might just boondock here for the foreseeable future when we get it done.

<TEXT> I lived in a 29ft RV for 6 months with 3 adults, 2 kids, and 2 dogs. We are currently renovating it to a more "tiny house" format and then will be moving back in (minus one adult) on family land. After living in it for 6 months we learned a lot about what worked and what didn't for us. My best advice is pick a priority as far as living space and put the most thought and time into designing and building it. 

For us, the kitchen was the biggest problem area, and so we are making basically the back 1/4th the kitchen with a much larger counter area and more thoughtful storage. The back wall from where the counter will be up to the ceiling is pegboard to hang the most used pots, pans, utensils and whatnot. We are also upgrading to an apartment size fridge. 
 
Second priority was beds. My husband and I are big people, and restless sleepers so we opted to each have our our twin size bed that doubles as a couch during the day, the kids will have lofts until we get the kids their own rv/tiny house when they are a little older.

As far as storage, put a lot of thought into it. Big cabinets are useless, they just become black holes where things get put and are never seen again. Use totes, bins, boxes, baskets, etc to organize and put things in a place where you can see the area to retrieve what you need. We curtained off the "cockpit" and have it packed with stuff, but all hanging or in stacking bins so nothing is buried under other crap.

I hope this is helpful </TEXT>

Then, when I had it fleshed out fairly well I asked the writer/director of our current production to take a look at it. He is going to help he, but he is a busy guy and I want to do as much of the work on it as possible without expecting him to hold my hand. That is great advice on how to move forward! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello! I am new to this sub, but I recently stumbled into a playwriting situation and I need some guidance. I wrote up a sample of a play idea I had for the Tombstone Repertory Company to be used down the line. The  "head guy" loved it, and announced to the company last night my play will most likely be the fall production. I am SO excited, but this is my 1st attempt to write a play. I usually write fantasy fiction, so this is quite a step outside my comfort zone. I am more than happy to provide more details, but I just need some tips and encouragement. There is suddenly a lot of pressure for my first attempt at playwriting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just did (amateur, community theater) stage makeup this weekend. I applied powder, then dark foundation, then more powder to set it (my favorite tip learned here on MUA) I then did a thin line of blue eyeliner on the top lids only, mascara and a metric ton of warm pink blush. I used a light touch of warm pink lipstick. This was for a more "natural" look, (little kids and men) but it might make a good base to build a more dramatic look from. Best of luck, and please post pics of some of the dancers finished looks if you can! </TEXT>

If not being able to predict a bad outcome to a seemingly positive life decision were a sign of bad parents, we would all fall in that category,  I'm sure.

<TEXT> Not exactly retail, but my husband works a gunfight show in Tombstone AZ. Yesterday while the guys were hawking for the last show of the day a woman came up to him and another gunslinger for a picture.

No big deal, happens 100 times a day. Only this woman grabbed the Marshall badge of his vest, breaking it off the pin, yanked the hat off the other guy, then pulled his gun out of the holster to pose for the picture.

Both guys freak out, along with a few bystanders. He asked the woman for the gun back, and she is like "what's the big deal?"
He informs her it is a real gun she is waving around, and although he is 99% sure it's unloaded you should always treat it like it's loaded.
She then says something like it's just blanks, and is informed even blanks can do a lot of damage or even kill at close range.

She finally gets the message and sheepishly hands the gun back. She notices the broken Marshall badge pin and turns bright red, takes the pic quickly, and rushes on her way. </TEXT>

I will be in both my hometown (Indiana) paper as well as my current city paper (Arizona) this week. This is something I had no idea how to do last week, maybe took me an hour of work, and will put my name and titles in front of potentially 40,000+ pairs of eyes this week. For an absolute beginner and self published author, this is a priceless resource I wanted to share.
*EDIT
As requested [HERE](http://www.selfpub.info/templates/book-press-release-templates-and-examples.html) is the press release template I used. [HERE](http://thetoridouglas.com/press/) is my own press release that I sent to the newspapers. I plan to send it out to the local TV stations as well, and will keep you all posted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! My name is Tori Douglas and I have self published the first two books of my fantasy series. I am currently working on the third, and have the chance to have them all professionally edited. I launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund it.

<TEXT> Different writing methods for different writers. Some people do well with high output that can later be distilled down, others need to dwell over their every word choice. Each writer needs to find what method makes them, personally, a better writer. I need a goal. I try to have a weekly wordcount goal, and I build some slack into it so I don't feel pressure to just pump out whatever. I do, however, need a goal. Wordcount goals work for me but I don't think it's a blanket answer to all writers to follow. </TEXT>

A dog could chew my arm off and I would still do my best to help them. Owners screaming at me over $$ or them thinking they know better than a vet or other professional who has dedicated their career to animals loses any fuck I had to give as soon as the attitude starts

MAKEDA, QUEEN OF SHEBA - THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN-THE VIRGIN WARRIOR QUEEN 

"Ancient moon priestesses were called virgins. "Virgin" meant not married, not belonging to a man-a woman who was "one-in-herself." The very word dervies from a Latin root meaning strength, force, skill; and was later applied to men: virle. Ishtar, Diana, Astarte, Isis were all called virgin, which did not refer to sexual chasity, but sexual independence. And all great culture heroes of the past, mythic or historic, were said to be born of virigin mothers: Marduk, Gilgamesh, Buddha, Osiris, Dionysus, Genghis Khan, Jesus-they were all affirmed as sons of the Great Mother, of the Original Onem their worldly power deriving from her. When the Hebrews used the word, and in the original Aramaic, it meant "maiden" or "young woman," with no connotations of sexual chasity. But later Christian translators could not conceive of the "Virgin Mary" as a woman of independent sexuality, needless to say; they distorted the meaning into sexually pure, chaste, never touched. When Joan of Arc, with her witch coven associations, was called La Pucelle-"The Maiden," "the Virgin"- the word retained some of its original pagan sesne of a strong and independent woman."

I came across this concept of virginity early in my Pagan journey (1999) and it has been an important distinction in the term "virgin" for me ever since. I hope this helps, and feel free to PM me if I can help in any way. We as women, especially ones dealing with the lifelong effects of abuse, need every spiritual tool we can find.

<TEXT> Just a thought, an ancient definition of "virgin" is a woman of her own worth, not belonging to a husband or father, and therefore "owned" by no man. This made her sexually free.

<TEXT> My husband was raised in a racist family. It took years of being in the world, outside of our whitebread small town, to get enough life experience with people he was raised to see as inferior or wrong to counteract that. Even now, years later, he is hyper-sensitive that he is being unintentionally racist. It takes a long time to overcome those dyed in the wool, knee jerk reactions, but the fact that you are aware it is not a good way to be and want to correct it speaks volumes. Go easy on yourself.

We are going to live on my parents land and hook into their water and electric while building, then find a piece of land to park them on. We want a well on our land, or at least in an area one can be drilled. We live in an area with aquifer access. Look up a map of aquifers for the state/area your land is in.

<TEXT> My best advice is to keep it short and sweet. When a situation like this comes up address it in a casual way, giving age appropriate details like "that's not a tail, silly. Boys have different parts in their underwear than girls" then if this leads to another question, answer that one. Building things like that up into The Talk just makes everyone uncomfortable. Same thing with "stranger danger", why their private parts are private, We have ongoing conversations instead of A Talk. My kids are 4 and 8 and they feel comfortable asking me and my Hubs anything, because their questions are just answered with no fanfare. It's only hard if you build it up in your head. Best of luck </TEXT>

<TEXT> We felt strongly because he was a loudmouth douche. The defense does not have the burden of proving innocence,  they just have to prove doubt. The defense in the case proved reasonable doubt. The prosecution left too many questions open to interpretation. In our system you must convict on evidence and whether there is reasonable doubt. You cannot convict someone for being a douche, or he would be in jail. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a lawyer and this will get buried, but here goes. I was foreperson on a jury for a rape case in about 2006. Everyone on the jury thought the accused was guilty, but the guy had a great lawyer and the prosecution just flat dropped the ball. We had little choice but to find him not guilty.

 As we were all leaving the courtroom, the defendant started yelling across the lobby about, bragging that he knew we would let him off. As the bailiffs ushered him away from us, I happened to get into the elevator with the prosecutors.

They asked me why we found him not guilty and I flat unloaded on them, telling them that we jurors had to live with letting a rapist walk free because they were incompetent. When the elevator opened, the rest of the jury members were waiting on me, since they were worried when their elevator left with me still in the upper lobby with the ranting rapist, and were stunned when the now sheepish prosecutors got off my elevator car. 

I think about that poor woman often, and wish I could express my shame that I had to be a part of the legal process that denied she was raped and let an arrogant, rapist pig of a man get away with it.

I am going to drive and camp from Arizona to Indiana, stay for a week to visit family and friends, then my step daughter will join us for the trip back. We are going to camp and visit state parks like the Blue Hole in New Mexico and visit Crater of Diamonds in Arkansas. We are leaving June 17 and I'm planning a 3 week round trip. I'm trying to raise money to replace a few items of camping equipment and for the trip itself (gas, food, camping fees) I am more than happy to provide any info and will post pics and update from the road. </TEXT>

If you want to return a puppy for acting like a puppy and/or having distemper then you should. You are not a responsible dog owner. It's not your fault, not everyone is cut out for dog ownership.

<TEXT> I often think of my childhood and wonder how I survived. I was generally unsupervised (in a benevolent, small town in the 70's-80's way) and it boggles the mind how many things could have happened. I would ride my bike miles out into the country, without telling anyone I left, would play in the creek or overgrown fields alone, break into abandoned houses, and once broke into the recently burned down Jr High building. All the shit I would have a heart attack if my kids did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are in south east Arizona  and taking the northern route there. We are stopping in Santa Rosa to camp at the Blue Hole the 1st night. The rest is up to how far we want to drive each day. I am shooting for a fun trip over making good time. My Mom has offered to get us a hotel any night the weather is bad, or I just want a bed and air conditioning.

We are headed to north central Indiana, but stopping in Terre Haute for an overnight with friends there. On the way back, I want to go the southern route through Memphis, then Arkansas to Crater of Diamonds. Beyond that I am open to suggestion.

I plan on taking 4 days to drive out, camping at state parks along the way, then spending a week in Indiana to see family and fiends before taking another route back. I could use any advice, from road trip tips to advice on camping gear. I also have a [GoFundMe](http://www.gofundme.com/2p2xbk) campaign to raise money for the trip, and would love any advice on promoting it without coming across like I'm begging. My girls and I just really need something positive to look forward to and plan for. I will be [blogging](http://www.hippie-witch.blogspot.com) about the trip for anyone interested. Thanks guys </TEXT>

My plan at the moment is to take 4 days to drive out, camping at cool state parks on the route, spend a few days visiting family and friends in Indiana, then an alternate route home. My girls are 3, 8, and 13. Any and all advice is appreciated,  as this will be my first solo road trip with the kids due to my husband having to work. Thanks, Reddit </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am living in an RV at the moment. We got it dirt cheap and have been slowly renovating it. We will be in the RV for the next 2-8 months while we are preparing to buy a small house/land and plan to make it a guest house/kids room when we get to that point. Our long term plan is to have a "compound" of several small structures on a property.

The older RV's have fewer "extra systems"to be maintained, as well as fewer bells and whistles as far as design and floor plan,so less to rip out or change to get to your intended plan for it. We have a 1979 Allegro. It needs work to be reliable as far as driving, but we only plan to move it once to our future home site, so that is not a priority. We converted the tub to storage, and will be restoring the loft bed over the driving cabin that the previous owners took down for my stepdaughter when she comes for the summer.

I have seen a lot of Tiny House features that we plan to use as we renovate the RV to make it more livable and user friendly, and after 2 months with us all (5) here, we are getting a practical sense of what really works for us, and what only seemed good in theory.

 My advice would be to keep an eye on Craigslist and buy an older RV that is structurally sound and get to work. If nothing else,you can use the RV as a learning process to see what your practical needs are when you build a Tiny House. Best of luck to you, and I hope this helps in your planning!

Just FYI, here are some pics. The changes here are mostly cosmetic, but you can get some idea. We are going for a Gypsy Vardo theme, so be warned of bright colors!

<TEXT> I know someone who has yet to learn this lesson. 11+ years of going to court over custody/support issues and she still does not understand part of the reason the judge does not respect her is because she is dressed like a homeless lumberjack, does not stand when asked by the court, talked back to the judge, or even over the judge speaking using swear words. The other part of the no respect is that she refuses to get a job, takes her baby-daddy to court 2x a year to get support raised every year because she refuses to get a job, and got caught in welfare/food stamp fraud, but that's another story.

<TEXT> I was a customer at a drugstore that does not have green walls yesterday. I was in the very long line of the sole open register waiting patiently to buy oragel and ibuprofen for my daughter who was crying inconsolably with a toothache out in the car with my Mom.

 The older man behind me told me he needed to go in front of me because his hip hurt. Normally I would always let some someone, especially an older person, go in front of me in line but my daughter was really in pain and he had several items to my 2 items. I politely told him no and explained why, then turned back around. 

He started muttering about his hip, and I was actually about to just let him in front of me because i was feeling guilty when a clerk came up and said she could take him on the other register.  He said "Oh, no. I want to pick out some of these candy bars."

Yeah, you were really hurting. I payed for my items and got out before I bit my tongue in half trying not to pop off a smart off comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have seen a lot of splashy headlines about the far right wanting to abolish abortion under any circumstance. I have not seen any talk of putting a support structure in place for the mothers denied abortions to raise these kids. 

Do they propose to impose child support on the rapists? Will the state step in to raise the children left motherless because Mommy died due to pregnancy complications with their little brother or sister? Am I just not getting this side of the story, or do these politicians only care about the fetus and once it comes out of Mommy and is a child they lose interest?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am the primary caregiver for my Dad, who has Alzheimer's with periods of dementia. My SO and I have begun to refer to his dementia as "River Tam". He can get pretty belligerent, especially when we have no idea what he is talking about, and it can be pretty upsetting. We use it as a way to lighten up the situation for ourselves, as it's a 'laugh or cry' type of situation. My SO has even started saying "Eta Kooram Nah Smech" when we put my Dad in bed.

EDIT: Browncoats FTW! You guys have just made my month with the awesome love I'm getting! Keep flying and stay shiny! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I posted [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/16ah1z/started_paleo_about_2_weeks_ago_going_to_the_dr/) about dreading talking to the Dr about shifting to Paleo to lose weight when she called me in to talk about my (completely unrelated to starting Paleo) high blood sugar and high cholesterol. Turns out my blood sugar was only slightly elevated, but due to my family history of diabetes, she wanted to talk to me about how to make changes to stop from becoming diabetic, get my cholesterol down, and counteract my anemia. She told me to cut out carbs, use butter, olive or coconut oil, and eat lots of meat and vegetables. I asked, wearily, if she meant like the Paleo diet...and she said YES! That's the best diet for you to both lose weight and get the blood sugar and cholesterol under control. I was worried for nothing, and now even more sure that the choice to eat Paleo and get my fat ass moving are**the** changes that are going to change my life and health. Thanks to everyone who gave me tips and inspiration. I am now twice as committed to get healthy.
*EDIT I forgot to mention I lose 3 lbs in 7 days! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just started Paleo and Couch to 5k to lose weight. I went to the Dr. last week and had a full work-up. Got a call today that my tests came back and the Dr. wants to see me Friday morning to "discuss my blood sugar and high cholesterol". I have never had issues with blood sugar or cholesterol, despite my weight. I feel that Paleo is the way to go, and think it will help the Diabetes, but how likely is it that my Dr. would be on board, and if not do I just do what I want anyway? </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the things I've done right in my life was to really live it up in my 20's. Clubs, trips, strip joints, party weekends that started on Thursday, hook-ups...crazy times. I feel like I got it all out of my system and got engaged after I started slowing down on the party times. Waited 2 years after we got married to have kids so we could just be a couple for a while. I watched a lot of my friends settle down and start families too early and go through the Quarter Life Crisis bit to do all the shit they "missed out on". They ruined their marriages, lives, and in one case have really screwed up a kid emotionally by saying selfish and inappropriate things to a young child. (i.e. "Having you ruined my life" etc) I tell anyone who will listen to live the shit out of your 20's and get it all out of your system, it's really the only time of your life you can be that irresponsible and selfish and not fuck your life up completely.  </TEXT>

There is no way of understanding such a tragic event, I don't know what could be said to make it make sense to me when terrible things like this happen or why I think anyone on T.V. or the internet could give me enough facts to make it make sense.

I need to get my shit together before her Grandpa brings her home in 2 hrs so that I can be calm and answer her questions without scaring her.

<TEXT> On Monday I prepared everything for a weeks worth of salads with chicken, avocado, onion, cucumber and celery. I have had it for lunch every day this week and am eating one as I post this. I Drank the last soda in the house 2 days ago and won't be buying more. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/i2dLRh.jpg) is what my ingredients and assembled salad look like. My plan is to grab different veggies each shopping trip to throw in the mix and keep it interesting. The good thing is I live pretty far from any fast food so it's easier to make a salad then pack up my 3 yr old and hit a drive thru. I don't know if I lost any this week, but I sure feel good! </TEXT>

I have to get my shit together for myself and my family. I have taken the first steps, and have a Dr appt. tomorrow to get a little more input about how to proceed. As I said on the intro thread, this has to be the time I make it happen, I'm running out of time. Best of luck to you as you fight the good fight, I hope we both are reaping the sweet progress pics karma in the coming months! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always jump in, over do it, and quit, so I am going to start with tracking my calories, then slowly cut my intake down. As far as exercising, I have been pretty sedentary the last few months due to anxiety and depression issues so I am going to just MOVE for the first little bit, then add in more structured exercise. At my size, any change reflects on the scale. In the past I would always exercise way past my fitness level, get hurt, and stop so I really want to start slow and steady. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi all! 37/F currently 311 at 5'8'ish. Dr has told me I would be great at about 190. His comment was "You are very muscular under there, you would look like Xena Warrior Princess if you got between 190-175." So I would like to test the theory. Losing about 120 would get me in that range, and when I get there I can see if I want to go further. I have started this journey MANY times since I was about 11 and I need so badly for this to be the time I make it happen. I have seen so many awesome success stories and pix, I hope we will all be the next batch of Redditors posting about reaching goals! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My humble opinion is that I can't prove anything is "real" about any faith, and you cannot prove to me anything is "fake" about it. If you need it proven to believe, remain an atheist because it makes you content as our faith makes us content. I never debate religion because I feel no need to prove my feelings. There are many faiths, even the lack thereof, because everyone has different spiritual needs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My husband and I lost out business at the end of August, and have been out of work since. Losing the business I dreamed about having for 14 years sent me into a tailspin of anxiety and depression. My husband got a great job, and starts training on Monday, but it is 2 hours away and we are moving to the new town hopefully in January. In the meantime, we are moving in with my parents and putting our stuff in storage until we have enough to make the move.

Our kids and I have already moved in to Mom's house because the chaos of packing was causing a lot of anxiety, and every time I plan to go to the "old" house and pack I freak out and can't do it. My Mom and husband tell me it's ok and that by being at Mom's, keeping the kids and dogs out of the way, as well as washing all the clothes and sorting them into keep/store (our dryer has been broken for months and so laundry is much easier here with a working dryer) is helping a lot. 

I have a lot of guilt and feel like I am just being lazy or a coward because I am forcing others to do all the work, but literally cannot force myself to go down there and help. I can't win, and I have myself pretty worked up about it today, the actual moving day. Once the house is empty I hope I can at least go down there and clean.

**UPDATE!** My Mom wanted to go down to the house and get something out of the freezer for dinner and at the last minute I decided to go with her. We got some food, the juice for the girls, and then spent about 20 minutes getting anything else we thought we might want or need at Mom's while we are staying here. It was not as terrible as I thought because I focused on our objective and when I started to 'freak out' we left. I cried on the way back and feel emotionally wiped now, but I'm proud of myself for the small victory! Thanks for the advice! </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was in my early 20's my SO left me for a girl across the country he met on the internet. Afterward I found out he had been lying to and cheating on me the whole 1+ we were together. His parents had co-signed on his car and he had stopped making payments. They gave me his new phone # because he ignored their calls. I called him and pretended I wanted to bury the hatchet and found out when he got to the new state to meet the internet girlfriend and move in with her, he discovered she was a teenager and her father was less than pleased by him showing up, ready to move in. After several phone calls, some of which I was offering honest help to find him a job if he moved back, but  NOT get back together in any way, I found out he had found a job there and was basically living out of his car in the parking lot. 

I got the info to his parents and the car was repossessed while he was at work, with all he owned in this world inside it.

I like to think I am a very forgiving person, and in the years since we have spoken and forgiven each other, but I got an absurd amount of pleasure when he called me to tell me about the repossession and I just played dumb. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have had our dog Mal for about a month and have been working with him on basic obedience from day one. His former owner had taken him to puppy training at PetSmart (he is 8 mo old) and so he knew the basics so I just practiced what he knew and built on it. I have severe anxiety issues and my Dr and I talked about Mal being my service dog. I have worked in the animal care field for 15 years and feel confident I can train him myself for Service work. We are working on him being focused on me when he is "working" and working on him ignoring distraction. He is super friendly and wants to play with every human or dog we see, so this is a big job. He will not be just a "comfort animal" but will perform functions to help me manage my anxiety in public. His main jobs will be to calm me during an anxiety attack by leading me away from people and distract me with "snuggles" and wanting to play. I would really appreciate input from handlers or trainers of psych service dogs </TEXT>

I personally dealt with a GM who went above and beyond when I noticed someone had hacked my hubs account and already had an authenticater on it and had stripped it while he was on the road. Hubs had the account back and fully restored the next day. Needless to say we both got authenticaters that day. If you have an honest issue, they will almost always fix it in an awesome way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We moved across the country to Arizona in March and she took it very well. We made it an adventure, plus we had been homeschooling her, and although she had a good group of friends in Indiana, one of the perks to her was we put her in a charter school out here and she loves it and made a ton of friends. We lost our business in late August and have been unemployed since then. My husband has an opportunity to get a grant to get his CDL renewed and has a job waiting for him when he is done with the course making twice what we ever made with both of us working. We would be financially secure, I could afford to go back to being a SAHM, and we would still be close enough to my parents for them to be in our lives, which was a big reason for moving here. The issue is we would have to relocate. We would still be in Arizona, but 1 1/2 hours away so we would obviously have to put her in a new school. She seemed fine with it at first, but this morning she was a total mess. She was alternating between crying and giving major attitude, which is not like her at all. We got her calmed down and to school, but I am really not sure how bad this is going to blow up or how to handle it without losing my cool. My husband and I are stressed out to the limit and don't want to take it out on her because she is resisting the one good thing to happen in over 2 months. 
**TL;DR after over 2 months of NO $ coming in my hubs got a great job offer in another town and my 7 y/o is freaking out about moving** again. </TEXT>
