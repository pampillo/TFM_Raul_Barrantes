<TEXT> Back in the early seasons, when the show had celebrity guests play themselves, it had the good sense to adapt the guest for the show so that it maintained its integrity. "Homer at the Bat" works so well because the writers made them fit into the usual show hijinks. Now the show builds the episode around the celebrity. Prime example: that fucking Lady Gaga episode. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From *It* by Stephen King:    

"Maybe there aren't any such things as good friends or bad friends - maybe there are just friends, people who stand by you when you're hurt and who help you feel not so lonely. Maybe they're always worth being scared for, and hoping for, and living for. Maybe worth dying for too, if that's what has to be. No good friends. No bad friends. Only people you want, need to be with; people who build their houses in your heart." </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Cast more black people, but only in roles I approve of."

I saw this very article on my FB feed today. SLJ is literally the worst actor she could have picked for this rant. You'd be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't know who he is, and I think it's safe to say most people think he's awesome. Not only that, he's the most profitable actor of all time (all the movies he's been in add up to the largest total revenue). Casting him is a massive benefit to a movie, not something a director will begrudge. Shit, he's sometimes the only good part of a movie. And what does she think will happen? That by playing a villain everybody will suddenly hate him and then infer all black people must be evil tentacle monsters? I'm sorry, maybe my whiteness is blinding me, but I don't see the harm here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your opinion of a joke is not law. Just because you can't find it funny, doesn't mean others aren't allowed to. People are allowed to laugh as much as you have the right not to. Put 100 people in a room and you get 100 different senses of humor. There's no jury that gets to cherry-pick and decide what jokes are okay and what aren't acceptable because a consensus would be impossible (and it's also a stupid idea). So it's either all the jokes, or none at all. You could acknowledge people can be different from you and go on with your life like everyone else, but you'd rather pat yourself on the back for your perceived moral superiority and label anyone who doesn't see things the way you do as "hateful." It really just comes off as desperate attention-seeking if anything. You're in a subreddit called /r/jokes but are being a humorless cunt. 

Also it's a fucking joke.

<TEXT> I saw 8mm years after it came out and it was better than I expected. It deals with some dark stuff, so maybe that's why I liked it. I'm a fan of those kinds of thrillers. Anyway, Nicolas Cage (before he went off the deep end) is a PI looking for the victim in a snuff film. He starts snooping around in the underground porn world and bad stuff happens. Good movie. </TEXT>
