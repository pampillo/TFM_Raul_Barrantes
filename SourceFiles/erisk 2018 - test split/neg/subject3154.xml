<TITLE> Just finished Faulkner's "The Sound and the Fury" </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A month ago, I made a post asking how difficult William Faulkner's "The Sound and the Fury" is, because I've only heard great things about it but it is also supposed to be really difficult. I, not being a native speaker, was a little hesitant to just go for it but the replies to my post were pretty encouraging. 

I haven't read any Faulkner before but now I want to catch up on his bibliography. The language is so beautiful and vivid. It was almost film-like. Yes, I understood about 50% from the first chapter and about 70% from the second one but after that, it was a breeze and even though Jason's chapter was infuriating, it brought some clarity into the story and Dilsey's chapter cleared it up even more. I have to admit that I had to use a shmoop.com summary for some parts of Quentin's chapter because I felt really lost between his memories. It was hard to decipher who was speaking sometimes. (Although, if the voice sounded whiny and self-pitying, it was probably Mrs. Compson and if it was nihilistic, sexist philosophy, it was probably Mr. Compson)

I love the grittyness of the story and how one can really follow what the characters, which are incredibly memorable and unique, are thinking. The theme of racism in the south was also more prevalent than the first chapter leads to suggest. After I finished reading, I opened up the first chapter again and I was blown away by how much I could understand from it now. It was more like a fifth chapter. Faulkner always uses little markers (specific sentences, characters that show up or references to events), so to say, to communicate the time in which a scene takes place. It is astonishing to me that I can already tell which Quentin Benjy is thinking about, by his/her dialogue only.

I won't reread all of the book right now, even if I know that I would find out a lot of stuff that I missed but I will definitely read it again at a later point and I'm glad that I stuck with it through the difficult first half. It is very rewarding, when you start making all of the connections and everyething falls into place.

Have you read it? What did you think of it? How does TSatF compare to Faulkner's other works? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really. I think you've misunderstood. The katakana would usually be used to form a loanword involving "ka". The kanji for strength or power (Kanji is not the pronunciation of that symbol, it literally means "chinese character", such chinese characters are mostly used for nouns, adjectives and verbs, while Hiragana mostly serves conjugation and Katakana is for loanwords from other languages) would be pronounced "chikara", if it means strength or power, or "riki/ryoku" if it is used in a combined word with multiple chinese characters in a row. To confuse people the first word would need to end with  and the next would have to start with . However, there is something called particles in the japanese languages, which are short markers, defining the role of a word in a sentence, which would lead to  and  being seperated by some particle in most cases. In addition, it is not hard to recognize when one full katakana word ends and another word begins because you would never write  on it's own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard it said before that what stands Infinite Jest apart from many pomo door-stoppers is the fact that the characters are fleshed out and given a level of respect instead of just being cardboard cut-outs.
[Spoilers](#s "
Very interesting!
If I remember correctly, it is also mentioned that James Inc used to make his films in such a way that there are no side characters and that every character is fully fleshed out which is what, the book, Infinite Jest does too. In the first third, we see a lot of introduction for 'secondary' characters, such as K. Erdedy, C. Henderson, K. Gompert, T. Ewell. There are almost no characters whose backstory we don't get to know, even Bruce Green's past is told. There is also a kind of symmetry to the last third of the novel, where each of the 'side characters' exits, by visiting Gately in the hospital one by one, after which most are never mentioned again.
I think it is pretty agreed upon, that the structure of the book resembles that of the priapistic cartridge, with its circularity and addicting narrative. I like what you said about how the ending is written as if the novel didn't end at all. If you didn't know that it was the end, nobody would actually notice because there's no great climax and the storylines never seem to converge 'on-screen'. It's funny how the less there is left of the book, the more one starts to think 'oh no this can't all be solved in 50 pages'. The message at the end seems to be, stop reading, go into the real world and connect with people. The novel teaches you what happens when everyone starts to isolate themselves and retreat into vapid entertainment. Some people don't like that sentiment, because they feel trapped by the author to read the book again in the hope of finding the missing pieces of the plot, only to realize that some questions simply cannot be answered. Though, personally, I like the writing and the characters so much, that I can live without a resolved plot. I would also argue that no single writer could write a decent conclusion to the plot of that monster.")

<TEXT> I think it's pretty mean to assume that just because a girl is annoying, she can't _really_ be bipolar, because... Yes, why? Imagine you're bipolar and pretty open about it and people go around calling you an attention whore, who doesn't know what being bipolar is really like. That's what rubbed me wrong about this whole comment chain. Of course there are going to be people who unjustly call themselves bipolar but I think that we should cut back on the cynicism and maybe consider the possibility that that person actually needs help and is not looking for attention. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you very much. Honestly, what really encouraged me yesterday was that I was still able to take my A-level math and English exams pretty well, although I'm in a constant state of brain fog, it seems like if I really need to concentrate on something, I can do it and I can remember everything I've learned. The problem is the motivation. I guess I'll just force myself to do all these things that I'm expected to do and I don't mean that in a cynical, disillusioned way, fake it till you make it, I guess.

I definitely have the advantage of very accepting friends and I've told my mom about the weed and she was honestly relieved to find out that my weird behaviour had a cause and that I didn't feel extremely shitty out of nowhere.

I like comments like yours, because whenever I feel worse, I'll come back to them and instantly feel a bit better and more hopeful! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks, this thread is really giving me hope, I've been experiencing dpdr for a bit less than a month, also weed induced, and it's terrifying. The symptoms only get more pronounced and it's really hard to ignore such things as extreme light sensitivity or numbness of the skin. Did you also experience pseudo-physical symptoms and how did you deal with them, did they pass? It's very frustrating to have a day where you definitely feel a bit better than yesterday, just to be back to "normal" the next day. At the start of every day questioning whether I feel better, whether I am less numb and every day being disappointed by it. I know that in the scope of others, I haven't been experiencing it for long but my biggest fear is that it won't go away. I don't care if it takes 9 months or 2 years but I just want to be sure that it does get better someday. My ambition really took a hit and right now it's difficult for me to focus on activities that I had fun doing before and now they just seem, don't know how to say, pointless. Of course that's stupid, because nothing is more pointless than to worry about oneself 24/7 when the mind's going at 100 mph.

Just needed to vent a bit. Feel free to share your insights on these topics. </TEXT>

It really is like you can't see the big picture, only the parts that make it up. The insane light sensitivity really gets me, because it is difficult to ignore. I also seem to have worse eye vision at a distance, like I can't read very small text but it's not like my vision is blurry. It's hard to describe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> However, it is possible that this made the copy deadly in the first place. The conversationalist chapter takes place in YTMP, where he has supposedly implanted a cartridge in his head. But Infinite Jest V(?) only came out in the Year of Trial Size Dove Bar so did he implant Infinite Jest IV? V was supposed to be a completed version of IV and was the last film he made. Maybe the microwaving and his death made the cartridge so hypnotic and perfect, improving Infinite Jest IV into the perfect entertainment. It would have a symbolic message, with the artist literally having to sacrifice himself to create the perfect piece and would also tie in with JOI's conceptual, apres-garde, cleverness for cleverness' sake films he made. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Congratulations! There has been a similar thread a few days a go and I can only tell you what I told the other poster:
 
I would be wary of seeing Aaron Swartz's theory as the correct one, the whole aspect with the DMZ and IJ being made for Hal by James  just can't be proven in any way. We just don't know what happens to Hal and that's probably intentional. The ending does not make sense in some places and that's fine. Don't beat yourself up over it, you've clearly understood most things that are to be understood. DFW did not write "Infinite Jest" to be solvable and everyone who tried it (including myself), even read it twice for that matter, will tell you that it just doesn't add up.

Here is what I think is _actually_ implied in the book and what we can assume to be true. We can make up theories about the other stuff but they can't really be proven:

[IJ Spoilers](#s "It is made very clear that Orin has had the master copy of IJ for the longest time, up until the end, where the AFR took it from him by seducing him with Luria P__. The tape that the medical attach recieves in the beginning of the novel has 'Happy Anniversary' written on it. It was send on April 1. The anniversary of JOI's suicide. Also the package came from Phoenix, Arizona, where Orin lived. So why did he send the package? To take revenge on Avril, who he thinks has driven JOI to kill himself by having lots _and lots_  of affairs with different attachs. He wouldn't harm Avril directly, though, because he has deeply rooted Mommy issues, as becomes clear through his sexual attractions to married moms and, of course, because she is still his mother. Also Hal asks Orin why he went to the post office, when he doesn't usually write letters. He went to send deadly copies of IJ to previous love affairs of Avril. Steepy once remarks how many attachs have been dying by watching the deadly film, which is why he suspects that it is a terror attack by the AFR. Next up, we know that the Year of Glad is the last year of Subsidized time, it is mentioned in footnote 114. What happened? At the end of the novel, the AFR comes to the ETA but can't get hold of Hal, because he is send off to a hospital. Somehow (this is the part that can't be solved) Hal and Gately and Wayne get together and dig up JOI's grave to find the master copy and to save ONAN but Orin or the Antitois brothers already got it long ago. ('Too late!', as Gately dreams when he is hospitalized) And such the AFR threatens to release IJ to the public and the US administration has to follow their demands; take back the Convexity, stop subsidized time, and stop dumping their trash in Qubec. Wayne helped Hal and co. and has either been killed or disappeared otherwise. Marathe mentions at one point that there is an agent placed in the ETA already, that must be Wayne, so it would make sense for the AFR to execute him for treason. Wayne's father was a mine worker and in the footnote about the Jeu de prochain train, it is said that miners often played the game. Also Wayne is also canadian and has had sex with Avril, possibly to spy on her. ")


Now to what we can't know:

[IJ Spoilers #2](#s "What caused Hal to have feeings in the first chapter again but nobody can understand him? Is Joelle really disfigured or just too beautiful and ashamed? What is up with JOI's wraith? And Lyle's wraith for that matter, which also appears to Gately. The wraith can put thoughts in peoples minds and through rereading the novel there are a _shitton_ of spots where f.ex. Gately says something and is then commented by "that was not the word he used" or Mario says something else and it is commented that Mario doesn't really know the meaning of the word and where it came from. This happens often. Is JOI's wraith the third person narrator for most of the novel? Did Hal take the DMZ and how? If not, where did it go, Pemulis couldn't find it at the end. Is what we know of the film, IJ, true? Is it really what Molly Notkins described? What the hell is up with the end of the conversationalist chapter from page 27 onwards? How did Fackelmann die? Was Gately's dream towards the end, where he takes the bus through the Concavity and digs up some grave with Joelle and a sad boy, Hal, a premonition induced by JOI or just unexplainable coincidence? Has JOI made the DMZ and the film IJ for Hal? This is what Aaron Swartz suggests but I'm not sold on it.")

There are many questions that can't be solved and probably never will be but I personally still like, that there is an ending, if you look close enough. It is just, that many questions remain unanswered and you have to accept that. I made a similar thread in /r/InfiniteDiscussion, asking about the ending of the conversationalist chapter (p.27), which seems to throw up even more questions. You can look it up, if you want to. There are some interesting tidbits on that, as you've already wondered yourself what's up with the cartridge implanted in his brain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, but Infinite Jest is actually more zany than many people think: JOI's wraith, Lyle, 'Helen' Steeply and Orin, James Inc's films. It is a depressing novel but the world in IJ is not as bleak as in, say, Brave New World or The Road. Atleast it isn't for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, but the story still makes sense to some extent:

[IJ Spoilers](#s "It is made very clear that Orin has had the master copy of IJ for the longest time, up until the end, where the AFR took it from him by seducing him with Luria P__. The tape that the medical attach recieves in the beginning of the novel has 'Happy Anniversary' written on it. It was send on April 1. The anniversary of JOI's suicide. Also the package came from Phoenix, Arizona, where Orin lived. So why did he send the package? To take revenge on Avril, who he thinks has driven JOI to kill himself by having lots _and lots_  of affairs with different attachs. He wouldn't harm Avril directly, though, because he has deeply rooted Mommy issues, as becomes clear through his sexual attractions to married moms and, of course, because she is still his mother. Also Hal asks Orin why he went to the post office, when he doesn't usually write letters. He went to send deadly copies of IJ to previous love affairs of Avril. Steepy once remarks how many attachs have been dying by watching the deadly film, which is why he suspects that it is a terror attack by the AFR. Next up, we know that the Year of Glad is the last year of Subsidized time, it is mentioned in footnote 114. What happened? At the end of the novel, the AFR comes to the ETA but can't get hold of Hal, because he is send off to a hospital. Somehow (this is the part that can't be solved) Hal and Gately and Wayne get together and dig up JOI's grave to find the master copy and to save ONAN but Orin or the Antitois brothers already got it long ago. ('Too late!', as Gately dreams when he is hospitalized) And such the AFR threatens to release IJ to the public and the US administration has to follow their demands; take back the Convexity, stop subsidized time, and stop dumping their trash in Qubec. Wayne helped Hal and co. and has either been killed or disappeared otherwise. Marathe mentions at one point that there is an agent placed in the ETA already, that must be Wayne, so it would make sense for the AFR to execute him for treason. Wayne's father was a mine worker and in the footnote about the Jeu de prochain train, it is said that miners often played the game. Also Wayne is also canadian and has had sex with Avril, possibly to spy on her. ")


Now to what we can't know:

[IJ Spoilers #2](#s "What caused Hal to have feeings in the first chapter again but nobody can understand him? Is Joelle really disfigured or just too beautiful and ashamed? What is up with JOI's wraith? And Lyle's wraith for that matter, which also appears to Gately. The wraith can put thoughts in peoples minds and through rereading the novel there are a _shitton_ of spots where f.ex. Gately says something and is then commented by "that was not the word he used" or Mario says something else and it is commented that Mario doesn't really know the meaning of the word and where it came from. This happens often. Is JOI's wraith the third person narrator for most of the novel? Did Hal take the DMZ and how? If not, where did it go, Pemulis couldn't find it at the end. Is what we know of the film, IJ, true? Is it really what Molly Notkins described? What the hell is up with the end of the conversationalist chapter from page 27 onwards? How did Fackelmann die? Was Gately's dream towards the end, where he takes the bus through the Concavity and digs up some grave with Joelle and a sad boy, Hal, a premonition induced by JOI or just unexplainable coincidence? Has JOI made the DMZ and the film IJ for Hal? This is what Aaron Swartz suggests but I'm not sold on it.")

There are many questions that can't be solved and probably never will be but I personally still like, that there is an ending, if you look close enough. It is just, that many questions remain unanswered and you have to accept that.

<TEXT> You're not alone with that, many people felt frustrated with the ending. Especially, when it seems so close to being solvable. One could say that DFW pulls a trick on the reader, gets them addicted and then pulls the rug from under them, just like the characters in the book and their addictions. I mean, the book is very circular in its structure, just like IJ, the film, you could read it over and over again. Some people believe that DFW wanted to show the hollowness of entertainment that way. I think that's pretty cynical and ironic, which is exactly what IJ criticizes and it would be kind of hypocritical, when DFW advocates connecting with the reader again and telling stories with emotional impact, without the hip, cynical, ironic distance.

I'm also not sure what to think about it, but I like to believe that DFW would not write a book with many philosophical insights and great writing for almost a decade just to prank the reader but who really knows? </TEXT>

I've come to the conclusion that you shouldn't try to solve Infinite Jest. It's not possible and that is probably also the point it's trying to make. It's best to enjoy it for what it is and for the little insights that DFW scatters on almost every page. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, you're probably right. I have my doubts with Swartz's theory too, there simply isn't enough proof for his claims. I mean, I love Infinite Jest. It is probably my favorite book but is it ever frustrating to know that Wallace probably didn't try to explain all those things for himself, which may be the point but it is frustrating nonetheless because the solution seems to be just out of reach. (Kind of like Pynchon's "The Crying of Lot 49", which clearly influenced Wallace while writing IJ. W.A.S.T.E, weird names that could mean anything or nothing, an unresolved plot.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, if you phrase it like that, it's a really interesting thought. The question mark in "IJ (V?)" might suggest that the cartridge actually only became deadly after his suicide. We know the content is similar to "IJ (IV)" because it is supposed to be a finalized version of it, which would imply that "IJ (V?)" literally only exists posthumously. This would also shed a bit of light on why JOI stuck his head in a microwave. Not the most common way of killing yourself. It's a wacky theory but Infinite Jest is zany enough that it just might be possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my opinion, one shouldn't attach DFW's suicide to the plot of Infinite Jest too much, since it was written more than a decade earlier. Sure, he did experience depression and anxiety but I wouldn't go as far as to say that his suicide was planned way before, so it would accord to the plot of IJ. I haven't read The Pale King but for that one, it seems more likely to be influenced by DFW's suicidal thoughts. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Spoilers] What do you make of the April 1st Y.T.M.P conversationalist chapter? (p.27-31) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-29 11:38:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been rereading the book for a while now and I thought that I had a rather solid grasp on what happened with the master copy of "Infinite Jest" but reading that chapter again, where Hal talks to JOI disguised as a conversationalist seemed very disorienting to me.

The scene is also found in JOI's filmography, titled "It Was a Great Marvel That He Was in the Father Without Knowing Him", dated Year of the Trial-size Dove Bar. JOI had previously made films about his personal life, too. (Avril's infidelity, him discovering cold annular fusion, the beginnings of the Gentle administration etc.) Why is that important? It tells us that the conversationalist scene (p.27-31) is most likely real, and has happened, which leads to many question:

1. When has Hal stopped talking like a smart-ass, like he does in that chapter? For the most part (Y.D.A.U), Hal outwardly behaves like a normal person, although we know that he doesn't really feel much of anything. In the last chronological chapter (Y.O.G), Hal seems to be back to talking like a smart-ass but this time, nobody can actually understand him, yet he feels real emotions again. What triggered his first change? Was it JOI's death? Did it actually affect Hal a lot more than he himself thinks it does? Does his own process of grief/denial end at the end of the novel, when Hal is watching JOI's films in the Cartridge Viewer room?

2. At the end of the chapter, James escalates into talking about Avril's infidelity, mnemonic steroids that she is supposedly feeding Hal with, that a "priapistic-entertainment cartridge" was implanted in his brain after a series of surgeries. These are interesting clues, but what in the hell is up with that cartridge? "Infinite Jest" is said to be "priapistic" and there are often references of the cartridge being buried with him, hidden in his skull. Does JOI already have a copy of "Infinite Jest" implanted in his head, exactly one year before he kills himself? Why does he tell Hal about it? (Aaron Swartz's theory suggests that JOI made the DMZ and "Infinite Jest" for Hal but that can't really be proven. http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/ijend Here it is, if you're interested.)

3. If he has "IJ" implanted in his head, which version of "Infinite Jest" is it actually? There are multiple listed in his filmography and the most likely answer seems to be "IJ (IV)", since it was made in Y.T.M.P. "IJ (V?)" (Why the question mark?) was created the year JOI killed himself and it was reviewed by "Cartridge Quarterly East", which would mean that "IJ (V?)" doesn't have the same hypnotic effect, as one would expect. Additionally experimental camera setups are mentioned in the filmography, which makes sense, because Joelle described how the film was created using a weird wobbly lense. It just doesn't add up to me. Which "IJ" version is the deadly one, is it IV or V? We find out on multiple occasions what the supposed content of the film is. I know that there isn't an explanation, as to why the film is so deadly but I'd like to know what is up with that conversationalist chapter, because it seems to invalidate some established facts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I liked both IV and TCOL49 but I enjoyed TCOL49 a bit more. I really liked the feel of IV but I'm also not sure whether I did not understand all of the character connections and motives or whether you're not really supposed to. TCOL49 actually reminded me a lot of IV as far as the conspiracies and the paranoia goes. W.A.S.T.E, the Post Horn and the Golden Fang in IV. I guess I liked Oedipa Maas more than Doc but I'm planning on rereading Inherent Vice at a later point in life again. I'm very looking forward to reading his other stuff, although the hardest part for me are the flood of references to 20th century American culture, music and historical events, since I can't relate to much of it. I wonder how well I'll do with Mason and Dixon but GR, for now, is next on the Pynchon list for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've only started getting into adult fiction at the end of last year with "House of Leaves" and "Unendlicher Spa (Infinite Jest)", which I finished mid-February this year. Since then I've read:

* "Ruhm (Fame)" by Daniel Kehlmann
* "Zero K" by Don DeLillo
* "Inherent Vice" by Thomas Pynchon
* "The Fifty-Year Sword" by Mark Z Danielewski
* "If on a winter's night a traveler" by Italo Calvino
* "Freedom" by Jonathan Franzen
* "The Crying of Lot 49" by Pynchon, again
* "Die Taube (The Pidgeon)" by Patrick Sskind
* "CivilWarLand in Bad Decline" by George Saunders

Currently I'm reading Faulkner's "The Sound and the Fury", which is pretty hard but it seems quite rewarding. The writing is beautiful. Meanwhile I'm also rereading "Infinite Jest" but in English this time. I got to say, it's better in English than in German, although the translation is generally well done. Also, the second read is way more rewarding and coherent, for me at least.

I would like to read more but sadly I've been pretty busy studying for my A-levels, though reading many of the mentioned books in English (not a native speaker) has massively improved my word pool and comprehension of complex narratives.

I gotta thank /r/books (and to /u/nothingcleverleft) for introducing me to many great works, some of which I'm very eager to read already. (2666, Gravity's Rainbow, Wind-Up-Bird Chronicles, Pale Fire and many others) </TEXT>

<TEXT> **The Sound and the Fury, by William Faulkner**

Insanely difficult but it manages to keep my attention. I'm almost done with the second part, which started off way easier than Benjy's but gradually became similarly confusing to me. I'll probably need to read it again, after I'm done.

**CivilWarLand in Bad Decline, by George Saunders**
Extremely bleak and depressing but also pretty funny and surprisingly hopeful. Saunders is really good with dark humor. There are pages in here, after which you just need to take a moment to breathe and to digest what had just happened. Great book, especially for fans of dystopian literature.

<TEXT> Thank you, you cannot imagine how encouraging that is right now. I actually teared up a bit. I already know how this type of unknown creeping illness feels. 2 years ago I slowly startes hearing a ringing in my ears (tinnitus basically) without listening to loud music or anything else. Doctors couldn't diagnose the cause and nothing helped so far. Nothing but to ignore it completely, while also knowing that it is there. Right now it barely affects my life anymore except I don't like to stay in silence for a longer period of time. The first month was scary as shit. Waking up every day, wondering if it has gone away, only to be disappointed. Sometimes even tricking myself that I don't hear it, only to notice it a few moments later. Worrying every day that this might never go away and that this will be awful. But actually, as my favorite writer David Foster Wallace said, (something like) "no single moment is in and of itself unendurable" that it is just thinking about all the future moments that is frightening.

Again thanks for your message! I hope I'll get better and in the meantime, I'll try to distract myself with books, sports, Netflix or league.

Edit: I highly recommend reading Infinite Jest by Dave Wallace. It really helped my to get a perspective on (kicking) addiction, depression and also, competitive tennis. It's not an easy read but it's worth it. In one chapter, a character describes getting off morphine derivatives in terms of thinking about them every day and loathing every day at first but gradually, noticing that he spent a whole hour not thinking about doing morphine and suddenly a week went by, then a month and so on, which seems similar to what you've described. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Smoked weed once and half a week later I'm experiencing DP/DR symptoms. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-15 18:26:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am 18 years old and while celebrating my birthday with friends, one of them gave me a joint as a present and I decided to smoke it (with 2 other people). I have been drinking before, I know you're not supposed to do that but I thought that it wasn't that much and after all, there are a lot of people who can handle it. It was my first time smoking pot.

I smoked it sitting down and in darkness, we were outside. And after standing up again, I felt quite bad, like I was going to pass out and I couldn't see anything because it was so dark. I was really scared for half a minute and my head got very light. Anyway, I set one foot in front of the other and by the time I reached the streetlights and my home again, I proceeded to feel fine again and had a good celebration. Seemingly everything was fine. The next few days, I didn't feel anything differently until my family and I went to Italy on vacation(4 days later), when I started to feel really weird, it was very subtle at first and it still is not very pronounced.

After a bit of googling I found out that I check most DP/DR symptoms. Robotic automatization, head full of wool, numbness, feeling _wrong_ in my body, like I'm in a video game I can't control. Like I have some sort of tunnel vision, where I can recognize the different parts of a building/room but I can't grasp the bigger picture. Thinking waaay too much, making it worse. Losing touch with the reality around me. I don't experience loss of emotions and all of the previously described feelings are also rather subtle and hard to describe. I still function normally but I would rather just _wake up_ because it feels like I'm in a kind of dream.

This has been going on for 3-4 days and it's freaking me out. I don't know whether the weed triggered it but I was never prone to anxiety or panic attacks before. I am definitely not going to smoke weed or drink alcohol or coffee for a long time or ever. I did not experience this immediately after the party has ended but I could just have not noticed it until now. I know that this kind of thing could stay for weeks, months, years and some people never really get rid of it.

What are your suggestions to deal with my condition better? I was thinking of getting it officially diagnosed first, so I can be sure that it is DP/DR. Did anyone of you experience drug (weed) induced DP/DR? Did it go away for you and how long did it take?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

He's very enthusiastic about the books he talks about and usually explains his opinion very well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, it is not really relaxing, but it would also be weird if the subject matters (solitude, depression, addiction, purpose, pursuit of happiness and consumerism) were presented in a light hearted, easy, digestable way. It is done right this way, even if it feels that jumbling up the order of the chapters is a little too much, that's the aspect that makes the book difficult, I think. Even if IJ has been attributed to "post-post-modernism", I think it still has that post-modernist thinking in it, that reality can not be understood on the grand scale. The different parts of it can be understood, but you cannot put them together in a meaningful way. The difference in IJ's take on this is, that IJ doesn't delve into cynicism or irony. It critizises such detachment from real feelings, from taking anything seriously. Whether or not one agrees with it is up to each reader but I think that it is at least interesting to think about.  </TEXT>

Doesn't mean that there is no ending, it is just pretty well hidden, since the most important events happen outside of what's told. If you read the first few chapters again after you're done, you will have a _much_ greater understanding what happened in the seemingly non-existent ending. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have started it in late December 2016 and finished mid February. I wouldn't say that I'm a particularly fast reader but not that slow either. It is long but some passages keep you flipping the pages over and over again. Some may be a little boring to you, depends on whether or not you have interest in tennis and/or AA ceremonies. It is still totally worth it in my opinion. People like to say that IJ is incredibly difficult but really, it is just pretty long and it starts to pick up around page 300. As for the language and the footnotes, it's not that bad. If you don't have the urge to look up _every_ unknown word, it is going to be much less frustrating. You can use the Infinite Jest page by page annotations on the wiki but I'd rather suggest to just read it and enjoy. Be fine with things you don't understand, they'll most likely be explained sometimes later.

I'm reading "Infinite Jest" for the second time (in English this time) right now and I gotta say, that I'm surprised how much I missed and how much I can now understand from the early parts of the book. It is very complex, sad, funny and rewarding. Give it a shot, if you feel up to the challenge!


Edit: There is a periodic reading and discussion club over at /r/InfiniteDiscussion. It is easier to read it in a group and discuss your impressions afterwards. You just need to look when the next round starts, it should be rather soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great video. Infinite Jest by him continues to be my favorite book of all time. As for irony, I think he's right. Over time I've been unsubbing things like me_irl and the overuse of irony and especially sarcasm that's been cooking up in political discussions in the last few years is getting more annoying by the day. Especially in the dreaded YT comment sections. 'No, it's not like I don't understand irony or sarcasm, it just doesn't make everything you say funny.' It's cheap and best used in moderation. I can't fathom how people hold up the usage of irony itself as the pinnacle of humor. </TEXT>

After you more or less know all the characters it gets much easier. There is also the fact that the beginning of IJ is full of first person narration of (yet) unknown origin. This gets much less in the mid-section of the book, when the narration mostly stays 3rd person. </TEXT>

Although, if you did't get anything from the prose, it might not be worth it for you. Still, most people who've read it will agree: The general understanding of the world, the politics and the character relationships start to come together in the second half of the book. There are a lot of references to events that you could not possibly know about in the first 300 pages. That can be frustrating to many. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a non-native speaker but I consider my English (reading and listening comprehension) to be pretty good. As of right now, I'm indecisive on whether to read Faulkner's _The Sound and the Fury_ in it's original language or one of the German translations. As a reference point, the most difficult book I've read so far is _Infinite Jest_. Is it much harder than that, language and contentwise? I don't actually mind confusing/stream-of-conciousness narratives but it would be quite a problem if the language was too difficult. Have any of you tried the German translation (especially the new one)?

Just as an example: [Spoiler](#s "The flying roaches that Orin thinks about in the beginning are most likely mutated and originate from the Great Concavity, just like the feral hamsters or the giant infant. Not a chance to catch that one and many others on the first read!") I am also enjoying the original English version a lot more than the German translation (it's not bad but the original text just sounds more natural). Though that could also be, because I already know what's going on and don't have to piece together the story as much anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know, I did understand that part. It is not a coincidence that the last thing you're supposed to read is the first chapter, so you can basically start over instantly. Anyway (!), I would recommend reading IJ to anyone, because it's a great novel on itself, too. In my opinion, it is not necessary to understand the "full meaning of the book" to enjoy it nonetheless. You can (and many have) read it once, read the first chapter again, and be done with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with this sentiment:
Wallace's challange was how do you write a modern book, make it both entertaining, and yet adhere to his avant garde instincts and yet not rely on "irony" which he saw as a dead end and the biggest problem facing his generation of writers.

but the rest is just a theory (a cool one, but nonetheless just that), right? It seems like an overinterpretation to me. If there is proof to it, please show me. I think Infinite Jest works (worked for me atleast) without all of that stuff, too. That's why I wouldn't say that you need two readings. People get intimidated by a book that can also just be read to enjoy the writing, the characters and their little stories.

Though it is basically consensus that you have to read the first chapter after you've finished the book (which gets clear when the order of subsidized-time-years is provided). Still there are a some things that can not be fully explained.^1 And while I generally like the ending and its circularity, I can't shake the feeling that DFW couldn't come up with a proper ending. (no writer could nicely tie all that up)

^1 it is still conjecture, what _really_ caused Hal to transform (DMZ, mold, the tape). It's not clear to me why JOI's wraith doesn't know about Orin already having the master copy. As far as I'm concerned, JOI appeared to Gately to give him a vision of them digging up his grave so that he would find the copy, otherwise I don't know why the wraith would chose to appear to Gately at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the moment I'm reading "Inherent Vice", and I'm digging it a lot. It is said to be one of his easier novels but the fact that I'm reading it in English makes up for it in terms of difficulty. I already own a copy of the German "Gravity's Rainbow" so I'm probably gonna dive into that after "Inherent Vice". By DeLillo, so far I've only read "Zero K", and while I've read many mixed reviews, I found the prose really great so I'm kinda hyped for his more renowned work! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for this beautiful review, I hope you're doing fine now :) I also try to recommend IJ to everyone, it's not an easy sell but I don't think that reading it will not affect you in any way. If you finish the book, you will likely feel something, whatever that may be. I think it made me more compassionate for people with drug-addiction and depression (which some of my friends have struggled with).

Edit: I have seen that you're also a Pynchon and DeLillo fan. Out of White Noise, Underworld, Gravity's Rainbow and The Corrections (If you've read it), which would you recommend the most? I'm looking for some new challenge after IJ. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Inherent Vice, by Thomas Pynchon**

It's my first Pynchon and I'm struggling a little bit because I'm not a native English speaker and also because of the 60s/70s slang but other than that it's really fun. </TEXT>

<TITLE> After 2 months, I've finally finished "Infinite Jest". Let's discuss! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-19 23:13:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, after it has been mentioned and recommended numerously here, I've decided to read *Infinite Jest* by David Foster Wallace. I wasn't a big reader, because most people my age read YA, John Green or Harry Potter (which is fine) but I didn't really care for that. Maybe it was not the best decision to get into adult fiction by virtue of *Infinite Jest*, but it's been worth it! I'm not a native English speaker, so I bought the German edition, which has been wonderfully translated by Ulrich Blumenbach but I decided to reread it soon with a friend of mine, in English this time. I gotta say: The first 200 pages were pretty hard. 

Not just because of the zany and scientific word choices but also because the first half of the book bombards you with characters and information you can't decipher yet. The great thing about it, in my opinion, is that most insights and connections were formed after I've finished reading a passage. Maybe it's just me though. Some passages I found to be mind-numbingly boring but those were waaaaay made up for by the hilarious and suspenseful chapters. I really enjoyed the ambiguity of the characters' motivations and I still cannot really fathom, why Avril is so uncanny to me. Of course there are her affairs but the way she talks to Hal, Orin and Mario is almost creepy. My favorite chapter is probably the one where Molly Notkins is interviewed. It is just so vivid and revealing. I didn't really mind that there isn't a real ending and I've read Aaron Swartz' take on it. 

[Ending spoilers](#s "I like the idea that Hal took DMZ (by choice or not) because you can see him going crazy in the last few chapters, which would be hard to explain just by Marijuana withdrawal. Also the first instances of unintended facial expressions are visible before the fund raising matches. I'm not that sure about his theory about how the mold made Hal uncommunicative and how James created DMZ and the Entertainment to reverse the effect. Seems a bit far-fetched. Some people have said that they find it unlikely that Hal and Gately met and while Swartz wrote that it was because they met in the hospital, it could also have been the Ennet House itself, which Hal had visited before. ")

[Ending spoilers](#s "I also enjoyed the sad but neat character arc of a Hal, who could talk but felt no emotions and couldn't even imagine showing honest interest in any topic to a Hal that can't talk to anybody (but James and maybe Lyle) but has interests in lots of fields and has opinions and emotions. (As seen in the YoG chapter) But why would JOI's wraith make Gately have a vision of him and Hal digging up his body, when he should know that the tape shouldn't be there anymore? I like to think that JOI tried to warn Gately to not go, because it would be 'too late!' anyway.")

What do you think about IJ? What's your theory about the origin of Hal's weird behaviour? Do you think DFW couldn't come up with a proper ending? What do you make of "do it to her"?




For those who are interested, here's a cool high-res wallpaper I made from the big character map, a background photo I found and Photoshop: http://imgur.com/5tNZbwi

<TEXT> What would not be "machist"? Also most of the male characters are also over-sexualised. You can't tell me that every man looks like Lee Sin, Draven, Darius and Taric. These are also unrealistic body types. My opinion is that mostly people want to play idealised, comiclike badass characters. (Ofc the player base is mostly straight males but I don't think League is nearly as sexist as you make it out to be) Bonus: It is an *opinion* that Illaoi looks like a man and that Taliyah is ugly. You labeled them that. I'm sorry but it seems like you are desperately cherry-picking to invalidate possible counter-examples. (Like Taliyah, Illaoi, Vi) </TEXT>

Ich bin zu 4/5 durch und es ist fantastisch! Bisher konnte ich es noch niemandem erfolgreich weiterempfehlen, weil keiner meiner Freunde Lust hat die ntige Zeit zu investieren. Ich bin noch nicht ganz durch damit, aber IJ ist jetzt schon mein neues Lieblings-buch. Die deutsche bersetzung ist Klasse und hat viele Witze und Wortspiele, die so im Englischen nicht funktionieren wrden. Ich habe mich nicht ans Original getraut, aber wenn ich es spter nochmal lesen sollte, werde ich es auf jeden Fall versuchen. Dicke Empfehlung brigens! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha, I asked the exact same question here before I started. Here's the advice I found useful:

- Don't skip the footnotes
- Only look up words you don't know if you feel like you want to know what the word means
- Don't worry too much about the setting of the novel, it's going to be explained about a third of the way through
- Try to keep most of the characters in mind
- Most importantly: Don't worry about its reputation as a 'difficult book' and just read it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've read it in German and I generally liked it! My favorite story was the one with the Ralf Tanner imposter because it's the most confusing and interesting one. "Rosalie goes to die" was also pretty unique, it kinda reminded me of the game "The Stanley Parable". The worst one is most definetly the one with the internet forum. God the language in that one is so "Fellow Kids". I know that it's supposed to be the joke but it comes of like Daniel Kehlmann has no idea how people in forums really talk and the writing style in that short story is just obnoxious. Apart from that one I found "Ruhm" a pretty interesting short-story collection with unusual narratives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, I'm a 17 year old high-school student from Germany. I started reading the German, physical edition of IJ on December 20th and right now I'm about 900 pages (out of 1500) deep. So far it has been an amazing experience. The first 200 pages were pretty confusing and all over the place but somewhere around p 300 it really set in and it has already become one of my favorite novels! I only know about David Foster Wallace from /r/books. After listening to This Is Water, I was really impressed and definitely wanted to give IJ a try, especially since the award-winning German translation is supposed to be more than great. Really looking forward to the discussion here and I'm planning on reading through the English version sometime in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have just bought the German edition of Infinite Jest since it is my first language and the award-winning translation is supposed to be great (it took 6 years to make). After all the praise I've heard, I'm determined to make it through or at least give it a good try. I have read that it is useful to use three bookmarks, to take notes and to look up words or phrases but I'm not completely sure what I'm supposed to focus on. Should I try to keep track of the characters, their intentions, specific words or all of those and more? Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have just finished HoL. It is a very polarising novel but I enjoyed it greatly and couldn't put it away. It is not for everybody. There are some sequences which are very convoluted (Truant's long footnote in the Echo-chapter) and are borderline non-sensical or, at least for me, very difficult to follow to understand which is probably the intended effect but don't give up, it is a rewarding and horrifying read. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are absolutely right. Out of boredom I've someday decided to just learn a language, fuck it, let's learn Japanese. Put all your energy into it. Math is good too because it's probably more useful and can be really rewarding if you decide to learn programming later.
This is good advice, learning an instrument is also something you can do if you're bored.

Melee oriented playstyles in HM1 and 2 felt like too much of trying to bait the enemies behind a corner. I like that the extensive usage of weapons often allows for big combos if you want to min-max.

<TEXT> I think it's also different, because if we draw a cube on a 2D sheet of paper, we are looking on said paper from "the third dimension", from outside, where we can see all of the drawing at once. 4D beings could also look at out 3D world from outside and make a model of a tesseract, that will look weird and pointless to us but makes sense to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends, AFAIK the consensus is that we live in a 4D space-time. What you are implying is something like the super-string-theory where 5+ hidden dimensions exist but they are really small (around Planck length) and curled up. It's pretty hard to prove string-theory with our capabilities though. </TEXT>

Dazu noch so Szenen wie die Frisbee Scheibe, die auf das Auto fliegt oder wie Florentin gegen eine Steinwand klopft, wieso auch immer.

<TEXT> Wanikani is an online learning Spaced repetition system. It is paid though, nonetheless you can easily find the 50% off code. It teaches Kanji and Vocab through Mnemonics which are sometimes good and sometimes "meh". It also teaches radicals, kun, on, irregular pronunciations and has natives pronouncing the vocab. I like it so far though you really have to do it daily or the reviews stack up and also it is veeeeeery slow in the beginning and you can't adjust your learning speed. Maybe KLC is worth getting as a quick memory-refresher it isn't _that_ expensive after all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have decided to start to learn Japanese and I've now worked through the first three chapters of Genki 1. After reading a lot about Anki Core decks and the Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course, I don't know whether it makes sense to already start memorizing the Core vocab in Anki. I suppose that it will mostly be unrelated to the Genki vocab and I won't understand many example sentences anyway. Also, should I buy KLC already? Genki 1 + Workbook was pretty expensive for me and I don't know whether I really need it right now. Thanks for your answers! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would probably work until you hit the 13s/14s. Which is when you wouldn't manage to hit both knobs that fast and to switch to buttons. Example: you need to use the left knob and press the 1st and 3rd or the 2nd and 4th button simultaneously, it would get tricky. My main advice would be, wait for more answers. I am semi-experienced in K-Shoot but I always played with a keyboard myself. I'm sure there are people who use a controller. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have beaten almost every lvl 13 map but Party Stream. I also managed to clear about a fifth of all 14 maps but I've noticed that the difficulty varies A LOT. Some 14 maps are pretty easy while others seem impossible to me. Now my question is, is there a ranking of higher lvl maps and if there isn't, which ones would you recommend? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are right, it is fun but it really lacks diversity when the host chugs 14 times and I'm not complaining about trying to win when your world is invaded but it is just not fun fighting against 3 players with a sum of 30 estus at least. Even the fact that Invaders have some Estus just make all fights boring and slow because half of the time a player is running away to heal. Also it is impossible to punish properly. My hope is that From intoduces a PvP arena like in DS2's arena, which was pretty great after a few patches. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I totally agree, however after starting up HM1 again, I've noticed how much more fluid the mechanics work in the sequel, even though gunplay is borderline unavoidable in HM2. There are definitely things that the original does better but for me, the gameplay improved on some of the rough edges of the first one. </TEXT>

There are also comparatively easy 15s like Brain Power so this list helps keeping track of it, thanks!

<TEXT> I can enjoy some of the music and the aesthetic but for me personally the memes are also part of the genre. Some people take Vaporwave really seriously, some not at all and some lie somewhere in the middle. Also it can be hard to find good, or original Vaporwave because people who actually want to create that sort of music are just as accessible as low-effort or meme-producers. Though records like "Vaporwave is dead" are kind of ambiguous if they want to be taken seriously or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh my god thank you so much! You may have saved my paper! Now that I know that it's just a single note and it might not even have vibrato! This really helps out a ton, also I probably don't even have to explain DFT in my paper anyway so that's going to make it a lot easier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is my second attempt at writing this up again as I accidentally deleted the first one before I could send it... First of all excuse mathematical inaccuracies or bad English. I'm from Germany and English is not my primary language.

So the term paper is supposed to be about synthesizers and the fourier transform. It doesn't have to be very detailed or math heavy (15-18 pages only). My task is now to analyze the frequency distribution of a recorder and to try to "mimic" the sound by using an additive VST-Synthesizer. Now I have this sample (I will post it below) which is a continuous chord with some vibrato, which will be easy to realize by using LFOs.

My main problems are that I a) have never used Scilab and it seems really inaccessible to me because I don't any of the commands and b), thata I don't really have an idea of how to interpret the frequency plot where dB is plotted against Hz. Especially when window functions are involved which they are. The only thing I understood about window functions is that only the peaks are important. I know what dB and Hz are but I don't understand how to read the proportions of the harmonics from the graph. I'm assuming I can't just linearly compare the dB values, right? Do I even have to find out the proportions in order to synthesize the signal or do I maybe just need the dB values anyway?

Next up, in order to make the process simpler, I have copied and pasted one oscillation from somewhere in the signal over and over again so I have a continuous tone which doesn't change over time. This would also mean that the intensity wouldn't change either, which is good. It *does* sound less like the sample but it would be distorted when synthesized anyway. I don't think it will have a significant negative impact.

My main concerns are now:

* How do I interpret the FFT plot, especially with respect to the window functions?
* What about the Fourier Transform do I need in order to explain what I'm doing?
* Is it advantageous to use the copied and pasted signal for the sake of simplicity?
* Could spectrograms be of any use?

Anyway thank you very much for dealing with this, I really appreciate it.


Here is the recorder sample I'm going to use for now:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/oj1y6nkoc7e7i3m/recorder.wav?dl=0

And here are some screenshots of the original signal, the copied and pasted one and the frequency plot of the latter:

I hope this clears it up a bit! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you very much for the detailed answer, i'll look into finding an optimised recorder sample but the one I have right now is indeed only a single chord all the way through. There is also a demo version of MatLab I could try to use. It is entirely possible that my given fundamental frequency is not correct because of the window function approximation I used but I also generated a sine wave with the same frequency but it did sound the same so it might be the actual one. Thanks anyway I'll look into it! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need help for my 11th grade term paper about Fourier Transforms and spectral analysis of an instrument. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-21 09:02:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Firstly I know it is a difficult subject but I can already mostly understand Fourier Series or Harmonic Fourier Analysis, though I don't think I'll fully understand the Transform for non-periodic functions as it is too complicated. Now my task is to analyze a Recorder(instrument) sample with the help of Audacity f.ex.. So my question now is: Can I handle the Recorder signal like a periodic signal by only looking at one period of it and then assuming that it sounds that way all the way through? Or do I need to research about the Fourier Transform and FFT? Another one: If I use the spectral analysis feature audacity offers, I know it is performing an FFT and giving me the result through a window funcion of my choice. Is there a way to only get Fourier Coefficients for the fundamental frequency and its harmonics? (The recorder sample is at a constant 391 hz)
Thank you in advance </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry I must have misunderstood you. Well I personally would cut him some slack, releasing a game can be very stressful and his wife just gave birth to their daughter. He doesn't seem to take twitter seriously which is debatable whether he should but then again he kinda brought it over himself. Still the BoI subreddit is incredibly quick at jumping to conclusions and completely exaggerating. I remember when Dark Bum was nerfed slightly(it is still very much overpowered in my opinion and wins runs by himself) everyone flipped their shit and when Krampus' Head was nerfed the same thing happened. There was also a period of time in which people thought that the amount of blue flies you could have orbiting around you was limited because of inaccurate patch notes. I totally agree, accurate patch notes and clear messages could have atleast lessened the negative reactions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did not imply I thought it was funny, he literally posted that. Also I think he won't be losing customers because of that specific move, maybe some because of the whole convoluted thing. The whole release was very ambiguous so I think we should wait and atleast hear him out instead of grabbing the pitchforks like /r/bindingofisaac did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with most points, however let's take games like Gone Home, Dear Esther, The Stanley Parable or The Beginner's Guide. All games that people call "walking simulators". They can mostly be experienced the same way when you watch a let's play. Does that mean that all of these games are failures, because some of them don't have engaging gameplay mechanics but an interesting story or concept? I don't think so, though there's no doubt that developing  such a game can be financially dangerous because of YouTube and Twitch, yes but that doesn't make the games badly designed. For example: The Stanley Parable is one of my favourite games of all time and I could have experienced it on YouTube, which would be a shame but I think that developers are well aware of that issue and if they chose to create such a "walking simulator", depending on the quality of the game, they should know what to expect saleswise. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need help concerning thermal paste. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-12 11:14:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello /r/pcmasterrace, I have a pretty crappy Acer Aspire V3-772G, which does not have an easy way to access the fan and I want to clean it after a year. So now I have to screw open the whole thing and take out the motherbord in order to clean the fan. I really don't want to do that all that often so I decided to buy thermal paste which I could apply when I already opened the notebook. I found multiple videos of how to apply it/unscrew the notebook but I'm sceptical whether or not the guy in the video does it right.
Also I don't really have Isopropanol or special thermal paste cleaning liquids. Does normal Ethanol also work? And does the guy in the following video do it correctly?

Thanks in advance and sorry for my English.

<TEXT> You know that's totally fine. I didn't know the statues were so rare. I guess I just had bad luck. 
For the spiders though, I think it's a totally different thing whether or not you are playing 1v1 or not. In a 1v1 situation I totally agree, you have to rush it down. But with multiple player this isn't that easy. Getting locked in a corner (more precisely an impass) with 2 monsters (one of them's a spider) or with traps, can result in an unwinnable situation. Maybe I'm just salty because it happened to me but that got to be the most frustrating experience I've had with the game. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Some balancing questions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-15 11:29:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, so far I'm really enjoying the game. Especially when playing with friends or my brother but I do have some minor complaints about the balancing. I know it's in Early Access so everything is bound to change but I'd really like to know how you feel about the following points.

1: The statues are really unfair in my opinion, you could end up fighting a Demon Lord on herolvl 2 or 3 which is borderline impossible when you've already been weakened. I thought it would maybe be a good idea to make the statues appear a) on further floors only, b) make them only spawn in a floor when all the players have leveled a little ~lvl 5 or c) make the statue-monsters weaker than they are when summoned normally.

2: The second evolution of the spider or the spider in general is too strong in my opinion. This is actually something that's really bugging me. It's extremely frustrating having to fight a tier 2 spider when playing with more than 2 players. Especially when there are more of them at the same time or when the room is really small. They are way more obnoxious than any other tier 2 monster imo and that is only because the hero can't attack while standing in the spiderwebs. Because of that you can easily be trapped in a corner unable to attack or to get out. (More problematic with more players) I think changing the attack restriction to just a slow or maybe also an attack speed debuff would *definetly* improve the situation, I think.

3: (really minor one) I think the Demon Lord is a little to strong. Don't get me wrong, I really dig the design and the moveset but in my opinion the attacks are not punishable enough. He can near instantly fly in the air after failing a dash attack, or near instantly use a dash attack when the hero tries to punish the normal drop attack. Especially with items with the "Sun Ray" modifier, you will always eat a charge attack trying to punish anything but a charge attack. I just think a longer recovery time would maybe be appropriate. 

So that's all. I didn't come here to complain but more to discuss with you what you think about these points above. Feel free to tell me why I'm wrong or right and sorry for the bad English, it's not my native language.

Edit: Oh something I forgot! I REALLY think they should nerf "Berserker" because it basically makes a win a 50/50 chance whether or not you get to fight KOUROK, which is a joke when using "Berserker" or the Hydra. </TEXT>

Und sie endete sofort Scheie mit Ihnen fr mich, sobald sie wusste, ich liebte sie auch. So erhalten alle Ideen der Vergangenheit aus dem Kopf. Keine dieser Wahrheit sollten Fehler, den Sie, wenn Sie ber sie sind, aber ich bin nur sicher. Ich hasse es, wenn Freunde meines Babys haben bse Absichten und sie denkt, dass sie nur Freunde und haben keine Alternative Motiv. Aber idk wenn ich dir vertraue berhaupt.

<TITLE> [WD] Is Pet Doctor viable for higher difficulties? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-28 12:50:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm have some trouble getting over T4 while I have decent gear in my opinion(build below). But then I went on YouTube and found tons of Jade's builds which are said to be good enough for T6. While I know that many people don't like the Pet Doctor playstyle but I'm really anjoying it so far and now that I have an amazing Hellfire Amulet(still below), I really don't want to switch. So now my question is: What can I do to make my build more viable for higher difficulties? I only know of 3 things, get a better weapon, preferably Ren'ho. Get a better rolled RoRG and get the Tall Man's Finger.
I hope you have some suggestions because I can't really decide whether I should switch to a Jade's build. I already have all the pieces anyway. Thanks in advance.



My Build: I am now running a Pet Doctor with Mask of Jeram, Tasker and Theo, Strongarms, RoRG, Zunimassa's Set (Full Set Boni) and some Jade's pieces thrown in there. Also I recently got a Hellfire Amulet which gives me the Midnight Feast passive for free (so I can use PtV). Weapon: Ancient Pig Sticker(I know it's not that great). Using all the Dog Passives, PtV and Grave Injustice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely agree. Was just making fun of these badly staged and failed attempts to make a bad movie a little less bad(The pictures). The dialogue is so badly written it's not even funny because it's bad. The characters are superficial and bland. Every shot looks cheap and the tension is basically non-existant. Pretty bad/10

Edit: Oh and the whole "I totally filmed this with my phone" thing. Also the director obviously had no idea how teenagers talk to each other. </TEXT>

In 3 weeks I've sunk as many hours in TBoI as I've done in DS2 all year. So there's no need to pretend that there weren't good games or games good enough to compete with DS2. Also there where some decent horror titles if you're into that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is one of those movies where I wish it had some little changes made to it and I would already like it much more. For example the CGI eyes or the exaggerated foreshadowing. If they film an object for a long enough time or mention it often enough, you already know what's going to happen if you're familiar with horror films.
Still liked it though. The directing was good imo and it didn't rely on scaring you with jumpscares all the time. The focus on the family problems was pretty interesting and maybe even more interesting than the evil mirror lady part. Probably a 7.5-8/10 for me. (I'm relatively generous) </TEXT>

<TEXT> And what about the buffs you don't seem to notice? The amount of flies, IPECAC, Brimstone, only one fetus item is nerfed actually, becoming guppy has become easier, Chocolate Milk, Magic Mushroom spawns more often (due to being in multiple pools), and also you get more reliable stat upgrades from bosses. (Damage syringes, Cat O'Nine Tails which was garbage in Flash, Halo and some other stuff.) I don't completely disagree but you can't just say everything was nerfed without mentioning the buffs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ITT: People complaining about the Krampus Head nerfs. Seriously, for how regularly it shows up, it was just too strong. It made certain runs just less fun because you kinda had to take it if your run was not great and suddenly you got carried to atleast Moms Heart. For me it made some challenge runs ridiculously easy and also took away a little diversity from my runs in the past.

EDIT: Okay maybe 6 rooms charge is a little heavy but still, it really made the game less fun, for me atleast.

<TITLE> Movies like "Oculus" but better. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-26 10:48:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I recently watched Oculus and I liked it 
overall but the CGI eyes, the horrorfilm 
clichs and the endless foreshadowing really limited my enjoyment. In spite of all of that I still like the premise of that reality twisting mirror, and the lack of stupid jumpscares. Do you guys have any recommendations for movies like that one? Preferably atmospheric and not jumpscare heavy. Thanks.

<TEXT> Dude, of course not everybody *needs* them to survive, but there are also people who aren't as good at the game as you and not getting hit by attacks is great! Also "absolutely a must" is probably not meant literally. More like they are really good and by having them your chances of winning are higher.(Especially in Rebirth, where the orbital hitboxes are gigantic) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm basically at the same point as you. But I also think that SF, especially the online mode, doesn't let a beginner realize what he does wrong. I'm still pretty new (~60 hours) and I'm getting destroyed by cross-overs, just jump-in spam or shoryouken shenanigans. It's so frustrating to lose to those people dominating you with these gimmicks, which work most of the time because I'm a beginner... :( Also Tech-Attempts and when the timing for grabs is, is really non-understandable for noobs like me. Often a frustrating game to learn. Whereas a MOBA rewards you constantly even if you're losing. And if you're not such a good player, your teammates can help you out and give advice. No need to learn combos or frame data. If you just play enough, you'll get it eventually. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also if you really want to go for parries I wouldn't suggest a Buckler/Dagger setup. When I see those people I always play super carefully or spam jump attacks and guard-breaks. I personally like to parry with a) Rapiers because I'm used to the frames by now, and b) Fast Small Shields. According to the frame data these things gave so many frames, fast startup and fast recovery. Good for Backstep-parrying, Setup-parrying and the "Double Parry-bait". Of course you can also parry on prediction and most importantly, they do not scream "I really wanna parry you!", so enemies will play more recklessly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree to some extend. But there's one thing I don't get about people complaining about humanoid, magic res and uncreative enemies and bosses. What can FROM do to be creative? They have a lot of bosses in DS2. Making each of them completely different is just plain impossible. If they don't make the enemies overpowered in some way, any experienced DS player will rush through all the DLCs and their bosses. But I still find that they shouldn't copy-paste bosses like the Smelters or the Asylum Demons from DS1. That's just lazy. :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right? If he atleast made a creative, new cheesy strat... So it's just popularized copy pasta.

<TITLE> The DLC Weapons are crazy good for PVP! </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Mainly the Sanctum Crossbow, with minimum requirements and the 2 handed special attack it deals massive damage, it homes, it's freaking fast and people always roll too early or not at all because they don't expect it. Finishing people off with it is so satisfying. The Puzzle Sword has a nice moveset but it can be parried. So be careful with all the (Monestary) Scimitar shenanigans going on right now. Yorgh's Spear is hard to play because it's rather slow but it's fun nonetheless. Sanctum Shield is just a better Black Witch's Staff but the defense values are nice too. I couldn't really try the Sanctum Mace so maybe you guys can tell me if it's any good. Not really happy with the DLC spells apart from Dark Greatsword which is great.

Edit: Apparently the Black Witch's Staff is better than the Sanctum Shield so sorry for that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> or "the day I started leveling up". As much as I like the patch overall but some things are a bit extreme. As a former SL 150 player I really liked to use buffs, they gave me a chance to kill all the Havels I meet due to SM matchmaking. I didn't use them all the time, only in certain cases. But now buffs and especially RW and FW got nerfed THAT hard and I'm doing about 250-300 damage with a buffed +10 Weapon against these Havels only to get 3 shot by an unbuffed Katana. At high SM the only thing I can do is to lvl up myself. According to From Software's Beyond-the-Bonfire site the amount of 150 players is so small compared to 200+. At 150 PvP is getting pretty frustrating and I'm planning to go to atleast 200 now...

Edit: I AM squishy at 150. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh how I waited for this thread... So I was trying to get Summoned as a Mirror Squire when somebody touched the Red Summon Sign. (My build is a buffed Claymore with Great Resonant Soul to punish healers) So I was summoned by a 3 Man gank squad in the King's Passage. It began. Two of them had double Avelyns and the host was spamming lightning spears. But since the enemies were still alive I tried to use that to my advantage and shoot them with GRS. I killed 2 of them. (Both had Ring of Thorns) Then there was only the host, I tried to shoot him too but the Estusjuices were flowing too hard. In the end, where I thought he is finally going to fight me normally, one of his phantoms was summoned again and shot me with his Avelyns. Just Wow. Took out the game, started DS1. Time to do my SL1 run! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I was dragonbroing in the Iron Keep and some guy spawncamped me with Dark Fog and the he just waited for me to heal so he could shoot me with Great Resonant Souls. Like, the AoE of Dark Fog is so big and if you try to roll out, they cast another one of their 4+ casts. Really frustrating as a phantom who can't heal up. Also the range on Dark Fog is really big that I haven't yet found a way to avoid it. Do you agree? What are your tricks for dealing with Dark Fog spam? </TEXT>

I invaded Harvest valley and the guy I invaded just stood where you find the Branch of Yore after the sickle guys and used the Seed (He didn't kill all of them). Man, he didn't do ANYTHING, I was just staying below him and playing the waiting game. After I decided to Nuke him with Pyromancy he just chugged some Estus, he was trying to shoot me with a bow. That's the only thing he did. I tried shooting him myself but he had the high ground. After the most boring 15 minutes of my life I got sent out of the world. I still wonder how you can rely on that item that much... (He was NG+) </TEXT>

<TITLE> I might have found out what causes the so called "baby-jump". </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-03 21:37:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The "baby-jump" is a bug which causes you to jump shorter and so far it is not clear why that happens. I did some testing and I noticed, that there is a short period of time, where when you transist from running to walking, you will still be able to jump normally but WAY shorter. Also the Jump-Control setting made a difference for me. With the **B**/**O** button, it is still pretty random to me although I had more success with pressing the button faster to avoid transisting into walking mode before jumping, but with the **L3** setting, I was able to control wich of the both jumps I did, the short or the long one. If you press L3 while running, I think you'll do the normal jump but when you transist into walking and then press L3, you always do the baby jump. However this needs more research, if you have some information regarding this, please post it in this thread.

TL;DR: If you don't want the "baby-jump" to happen, make sure to press L3 and never let go of the run button.

Edit: Of course you can not jump with R3, silly me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well but I need to give them credit for Dragon Aerie and Dragon Shrine. Two fantastic looking Areas. TWO bonfires.   Dragon Aerie has a pretty nice shortcut and Dragon Shrine is a pretty difficult area with only one bonfire. Downside: Ancient Dragon. It is just bad/lazy design. This boss is only hard because he has a ton of life and one shots you every time. The fight can be easy if you looked up how to manipulate the AI and that should not be necessary. Same for Vendrick. </TEXT>

I think the ability to warp is a very important game design choice. However, my only complain is that there are maybe too many bonfires. I mean yeah, Shrine of Amana is shitty but there are 3 bonfires before the boss, and one after it, and the next one in the beginning of the crypt... </TEXT>

There's not very much skill involved in tanking them "Four Kings style" and hoping that they die faster than you do. DAE feel like that and those who have beaten them, is there a trick I don't know?

<TEXT> I don't know if this belongs here but I'd like to know why the Hornet Ring is considered to be cheap. It just boosts your crit damage, right?

Edit: Thanks for all the answers. I guess i can use the ring for gankers or for unfair situations, if I summarize the comments correctly. Just to make sure, I am not a fan of the ring myself because it doesn't fit to my playstyle but i watched some videos and many people were ranting about it, also it could have gotten nerfed, I'm fairly new to the game, although I've beaten it 2 times already. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-12-03 19:19:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Seriously, I'm a fairly new DS player (SL25) and just tried pvp to see what's going on. So i went to the Undead Burg and started an invasion. What resulted was a guy waiting for me and stunlocking me instantly as i spawn with some kind of magic puke spell bullshit, until i died, i didn't stand a chance. So my question is: Is it worth to play DS PvP or are there only these low level cheeser, and what can you do about it? Or am I just late for this game?

Edit: Thank you all for your answers, really helped me out! </TEXT>
