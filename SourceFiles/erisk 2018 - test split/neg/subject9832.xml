Los Angeles 
Encounter #1


The same question in his head. And they haven't even said a single word to each other. 

Why red? 


Red? The man asked. "It's a little dated." 


I like the color.


The color? 


You bite your nails too?


Only when Im sleeping.


Did anyone follow you?


The boy who sat at the desk shook his head no. 


Your name again?


Timothy.


The man behind the desk stood up and walked over to a huge office window, opening the blinds and letting in the last of the suns light inside. 


Did you bring money?


I want to see what you have first.


What I have first. Little piece of shit. 


So youre going to waste my time like that?" the man said, "You somehow find me, sit in that chair, and think for half a second what I have to sell is fucking cheap? This isn't the grocery store where you get to see what you get, if you think that's what this is too fucking bad."


The man adjusted his tie. He buttoned his jacket. 


You know who I am?


Timothy nodded his head. 


Who did you tell about me?


Timothy shook his head no. 

"I didn't tell anyone."

The man sniffed. 

"Look at my suit, my desk, those hardwood floors. Im a man of quality. Im going to ask again, The man removed a cigarette from his breast pocket, a lighter from his pants, putting the cigarette in his mouth and lighting it, Did you bring money?


Timothy nodded his head. 


How did you get it?


Timothy didnt answer. 


The man took a drag of the cigarette and looked out passed the window the city. 


How old are you?


Twelve.


When did you start having the nightmares?


I dont want to say.


Car accident?


No.


Father beat you?


No. 


Uncle touch you?


No.


Bullied?


No.


When did you start having the nightmares, Timothy.


I dont want to say.


I dont give a shit about what you want to say, when did you start having the nightmares? The man walked to the desk and tapped the cigarette mover an ashtray, adjusting his pants with his other hand. 


Timothy.


No.


When did you start having the nightmares.


Sir-


Its Mr. Berchetti, the man said, if youre going to not going to tell me then Im Mr. Berchetti, you understand? Not sir. 


Timothy nodded his head. His eyes taking a few sneaking glances to one of the corners of the room.


Interesting. 


Timothy.


I dont want to talk about it.


I dont give a flying fuck about what you want to talk about. When did you start having the nightmares?


Outside the office somewhere a helicopter thudded in the distance. 


A few weeks ago. Timothy said. 


Thats a lot of time. 


I see, the man squashed the cigarette in the ash tray. Whats the nightmare?


I just want her to stop.


Whats the nightmare, Timothy. 


I know the dreams will make her stop. 


You know its a her?


Timothy nodded his head. 


Every night?


Timothy paused and shaking his head yes. The pain in his eyes was there. 


Yes, Mr. Becchetti. Every night.


The man turned to the window looking out at the city again. Sheets of the dying sun laid across the city as the buildings surrounding his office on the 27th floor started to become shadows. In one of the windows across the way a janitor was cleaning a window. 


The man turned around to see Timothy standing on the chair. 


I asked if anyone followed you.


I dont think she can follow.


Timothy stared at the same corner now with his fist in little balls. A pool of pee on the chair began to grow. 

Can I see them now, please?


The man watched Timothy eyes trail from the corner, down to the floor, and slowly to where he stood on the chair. 


When did you start seeing her?


A few weeks ago.


Shes on your chest when you wake up?


Yes. 


What does she say to you?


Timothy closed his eyes. 


She doesnt talk.


Doesnt talk?


No.


What does she say?


The man took off his tie, keeping his eyes on the space before Timothy.


Timothy, what does she say.


She doesnt say anything. She screams. 


She screams. 

The sound of Mare. 


Are they words? 


No.


In English?


Maybe its too late. 


No, not in English.


Not in English. 


The man in the suit smiled and opened his phone, This is what we're going to do, Timothy. 


Maybe it is too late. 


Timothy, the man said, I want you to go downstairs, have a seat. Ill have my assistant make you some cocoa. And Ill show you the dreams I have, okay? Give me a moment to prepare them, alright? Can you do that for me?


Timothy shook his head yes, and has he left the room and closed the door behind him, the man in the suit was already dialing numbers on his phone. 



~ ~ ~





 In the lobby a phone sharp piercing rings belted the walls and echoed loudly as a boy excited an elevator and made his way towards the receptionist. 


Hello, thank you for calling the offices of --


The voice on the phone cut her off.


Nicole, The voice said, I want you to stay looking forward, keep that smile on your face, I can see you in the cameras. Dont flinch. Just listen. After you hang up on this phone call I want you to say youre going to the bathroom. Yeah I can see him standing there in front of you, just keep smiling. Keep smiling. Okay, so say youre going to be right back, and meet me at that shitty coffee joint you like down the street on the corner. We cant come back here. I dont know how the bitch fucking found us but this is going to create some problems. We need to fix this, bitch almost got a dream from me, you believe that? Sneaky little Cunt. Yeah keep smiling, sorry Im rambling. We got a Crossover. First one in decades I imagine. Dont worry about the boy, we need to worry about her trying to get into something stronger and more dangerous, we need to stop that from happening. Alright, hang up the phone, go to the bathroom, Ill see you in a bit.


The phone clicked. 


Nicole swallowed hard, noticing the boys now yellow teeth, but she smiled, and he did too. 


Will you excuse me just a moment? Nicole said, pushing away from her desk slowly. Still smiling. 


Can I hold your hand? The boy asked, showing more of his teeth, extending his hand now. 


Nicole smiled, and winked. 


Of course. 


Nicole walked with the boy down the hallway, Nicole still smiling. 


Hey, I have to go to the bathroom.


Okay. The boy said. 


Can I ask you something?


Sure.


Nicole swallowed harder than before. Still all smiles. And asked. 


Who's finger are you eating? </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Nice nail Polish, red is a little dated."

The man took a sip of his coffee, and set it on his desk.

"I get bored and I do it for fun I guess."

"Did anyone follow you?" 

"No," Timothy said quietly. The man standing behind the desk stood up, adjusted his tie and walked over to the window.

"Did you bring the money?" The man asked buttoning up his jacket. "Yes or no?"

"I want to know what they are first."

The man turned and laughed, "You're going to waste my time like that? Come here to my fuckin office? Sit in the fuckin chair. And think what I have to sell to is fuckin cheap? Do you know who I am?"

Timothy nodded his head. 

"Good. You better. This is why I have a name that is hard to find but people want. This is why you're in that chair. It's because I man of quality. So." The man cracked his knuckles, pulled out a cigarette and lite it, "So the nightmares, they bad?" 

Timothy nodded his head. Gripping the chair.

"How old are you?"

"I'm twelve."

The man crossed his arms. 

"Someone hurt you?"

"No."

"Car accident?"

"No."

"Dad beat you?"

"No."

"Uncle touch you?"

"No."

"What are the nightmares."

"I don't want to say."

"Timothy, What are they."

"Sir-"

"Mr. Benetti, you talk to me with some respect." What are the nightmares." The man took a step forward.

"I don't want to talk about it."

"I don't give a fuck if you want to talk about it. What are the nightmares, Timothy. I need to know."

The man walked over and leaned down looking into Timothy's eyes. Outside the window a sound of a helicopter thudded in the distance. 

"Timothy." The man looked into one eye, and another. Then said through this teeth, "I need you tell me, if I'm going to help you. What are the nightmares."

"I just want her to stop."

"Who's her?"

"I don't know."

"What do you mean you don't know."

"I don't know!"

"You know it's a her!" 

"It's because of her screams!" Timothy crumbled in the chair, crying into his hands, "It's because of her screams."

The man stood up, he turned. He walked passed his desk and to the window. He stared out to the city that was making its way home under sheets of orange light coming from the last light of the sun. 

"Do hear them when you're awake?" The man asked, turned around to see Timothy standing on the chair. 

His eyes closed. And his hands balled into little fist. 

The man crossed his arms. 

"Is she here?"

Timothy whispered yes then looked to the corner of the room. 

"When did you start seeing her while you're awake?"

Timothy said a few weeks. 

The man sniffed. 

"Why don't you get off the chair, and go wait outside. Give me a second to, "The man looked to the corner of the room. Nothing but shadows. 

"Alright go outside. Have a seat in the waiting room. Give me a second to go through what I have. You come back in, and we take care of this little issue. What do you say, champ?"

Timothy nodded his head and gave a half smile. 

The man slowly watched Timothy leave has he slowly inched over to his phone. Picked it up. And dialed it. 


In the lobby the phone rang reverberating it's sharp chimes through the hallway where a boy exited an elevator and took a seat next to a stack of magazines.

"Hello, thank you for calling psychology offices of--"

A voice from the phone cut her off.

"Nicole," The voice said. "I want you to stay looking forward and smiling. I want you to after this phone call to hang up and and say you're going to the bathroom. And I want you to meet me down the street at their shitty coffee joint you like so much. We have a real big problem. You see that little boy, don't nod your head, keep looking forward. That's a Crossover. We need to fix that immediately, little fucking bitch tried to get a the good dreams from me. Alright. Just be quick. I'll see you there."

The phone clicked. 

Nicole kept her smile on her face. Looking forward. Then to the boy who sat smiling staring at Nicole. 

"Hi." The boy said, smiling. "I'm Timothy."

"He's over by the container--" "Hold on guys, you know what. I need to relax. I know there's cartel, but damn, I'm just really stressed out. And you know what? Some of these mountains could really use a good climbing..." Yes, I'm excited! Chalk up my hands cuz I'm ready for the vacation package DLC that features rock climbing, extreme hiking, and people watching. 10/10 can't wait.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Alright, Now Let's here for a first timer here tonight--"

"Boooo!" 

"Hey, hey, hey first timers derserve a chance, okay? Alright. Let's give hand to Mr. Jeffery James! Come on Jeffery James!"

Crowd boos, some clap, The host exits off stage and slowly a boney tall man comes up to the mic, staring into the bright lights and speaks with a unreal confidence. 

"Hey folks, Name's Jeffery! Great to be here, man people get on my NERVES. I'll tell ya. Today, this guy, swear to god, was chewing gum so loud, with his mouth open like cattle, does that ever happen to you? Where you wish you had a hammer so you can just smash every fucking tooth out of his head, onto the ground, then curb stomp his skull until it because oatmeal under your shoes, then chase his crying kids and then smash them with the hammer and have sex in the gashes you leave from the blunt force trama? Anyone? Nobody?"

The crowd says nothing, some hang with their jaws open. Jeffery takes this as a bad sign, tries a older joke. 

"Well, speaking of kids. You ever notice how the scream? Always screaming, Doesn't matter where they are playground, backyard, you know where they scream the loudest,  the microwave. Don't you hate it, it takes ten minutes to shove the kid in there, you get the door shut, start jerking trying to concentate staring into the microwave but it's damn near impossible because your listening to this siren scream, "Help! Help! Mommy! Daddy!" - Man o man, don't you hate when this happens? I mean it's a hate or love it..." 

The crowd jaws keep dropping. Jeffery takes this as his first two jokes bombed. Well, third one should totally get them. 

"Okay, well this one time, Funny story, I cut off my own penis and fed it to my mother, don't worry, she was chained to the bed, I mean she wasn't going far I cut off her arms and legs, BUT she was chained. I stood right over her with a kniffe, and then slowly, started to cut my penis off, and man the LOOK ON HER FACE when it came off! Oh my god..you guys had to be there..."

<TEXT> I'm kinda bummed that in the game, if I place a way point, I can't climb into the passanger seat and let one of my computer team mates drive there so I can relax and enjoy this lush, amazing landscape. Any idea if they could ever apply this change? I don't mind driving, but like I'm always the one driving. It's just not fair. This game is huge, and I'm playing on NO HUD or fast travel on the high difficult level.  So it be nice to take turns, I mean I do pretty much everything. I kill most of the dudes. I do all the talking. I find the cars. I call in the helicopter. All they have to do is find a shot when I need it. Can we please pass around some of the responsibility? 

(On a serious note I think that would be a cool thing to put into the game. Place a way point, jump into the passanger seat, and let one of your AI squad dudes drive while enjoy this wonderful computer generated world.) </TEXT>

"**Service me, human.**" 

This is what I don't understand. I come here everyday, every day, there's hundreds of these droids, they keep and manage themselves, right?

"**Service me, human. Give it to me.**"

I just want to buy my damn sandwich and leave. But I go towards the door and this thing comes rolling at me. 

"**Human, Service me, give it to me.**" 

I see how it grabs at me. Trying to touch me in places. All my places. What is it about this robot that wants me. I have to deal with this shit with people, and now technology is trying to put it's dick in me?

"**Human, service me, give it to me. Give it to me.**" 

I had enough, so last week I looked right into his dimming red eyes that said battery low and go, "You should be shut down you stupid, horrible machine! Every day you try to touch my places, you broken toaster with wheels! I hope when you get shut down forever!"

It's been a week since that metal monster try to touch my places. Maybe it finally got the message.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ten days ago I stepped out of that machine. 

I felt the dirt in my toes. The heat from the sun and cool breeze against my tender skin. Goosebumps form as my chest takes in buckets of air. Sweet, sweet air. My eyes open.

I'm alive. I made it.

But made it where? That's a good question. See, when signed all the paperwork and before I stepped into that machine. I wasn't told where I would end up. It was apart of the agreement.

They said they would aim for the desert. Nobody knows anything about the future. They know the machine works. They can send me a few hundred years from the present. So they decided they would aim for the desert. It's sparse and away from society. I wouldn't cause any unnecessary distress. 

But downtown San Francisco is where I ended. There, naked, standing in front of hundreds of faces that just stared and stared. Like I was a shooting star...

It felt good, for a moment, it did.

It was all women, you see? I like my women ripe or seasoned. But not like this. Females of all ages. All shapes and sizes. Their jaws hung from their hinges and their eyes wide open. Taking all of me in. 

I wish it was me. What they were staring at. It was my treasure chest right in-between my legs, you see.

Currently, I hang with my face down. My arms and legs? Good question.  I woke up like this. Both of them gone. Not just an arm and a leg. Both arms. Both legs. Gone. Just little stumps now. I wish I had a chance to say goodbye. 

But I know why they did this. They took my legs so I wouldn't run away. And my arms to keep my hands from killing myself. 

I'm what you called "milked" daily.

Trust me. I tried. I tried telling them I could do it myself. How it's actually fun. All they had to do was supply pictures of Asian women and their feet and I was locked, loaded, and ready to unleash a tidal wave in any direction they pointed. This, of course, was before they put me under. And when I woke up to my new life.  

This is what happened. 

Apparently men are completely extinct. It's not clear to me why. There's just no men to take their seed and put into some pretty ladies tunnel of wonder and nine months later give birth to walking version of cancer.  

So. Me, having the wonderful balls I have, came to that point in time where balls have gone extinct. Gone. Finished. And my healthy, hearty coconuts we're looked at like rare precious metals.

Most of the days are like this. 

Morning comes and ice cold shower wakes me up. My eyes opened being greeted with the slab of concrete. My tears from the night before still haven't dried. I begin to shiver uncontrollably. They do this on purpose, you see. Man seed flourishes in cold weather.

The first thing I see other than the concrete just a few feet away from me is shoes. Nice, black dress shoes. 

"Morning, David." A voice says from above me. A pen is scribbling on a clipboard. She lowers herself down and wraps a cold hand around my cock. Inspecting it.

"It's good to go," she says. 

There's this canister in her hands. She shakes it like a spray can. I can see the shadow. The bottle with a thick nozzle shaped like a baseball bat.  She then places petroleum jelly down by her feet, taking a scoop of it with her fingers, rubbing it along and around the head of the nozzle. Then with her hand wrapped around my cock she slowly inserts the nozzle into the head of my penis. I can feel the edges drag as she pushes it deeper. I grunt in pain. I squeeze my eyes shut and imagine I'm back home with Martha. Sitting by her side with her hand entangled in mine, watching our daughters play hide and go seek in the front yard. "Watch me, Papa," my little one giggles running from one side of the yard to the other, "Watch me, Papa! Watch me!"

The pain rips me back to reality, and I scream. 

I think the jelly is just a placebo. Because I feel every centimeter, I feel every centimeter dig its way through. Then the lady presses a button. It beeps. This not only cue the nozzle to release, but also more screaming.

The lady pulls out. And she leaves. Coming back only ten minutes later and my dick is so hard I could fuck myself a tunnel through Mount Everest.  

"Good, good," she says, and she pats my ass.

For the next ten hours they will work in shifts. She will tug at my dick like it's a utter. Tugging and tugging. And because of that shit they blasted into my pee-hole. I cum buckets. Literally. 

See, my balls have swollen so much they have a brace so if my balls were to experience any kind of free fall. My sack doesn't rip and I don't die in agony. 

So I cum my first bucket. By the way, this isn't like cumming on a pair of nice tits, or in an eager open mouth. My dick feels like it has it's own mouth. It's own stomach. And when I bust, my balls purge themselves of their contents. My balls cramp, which opens the door for clustering contractions. Fifteen minutes or so the old hag tugs and tugs at me. Like a finger clasped over the head of a hose, I spurt into the metal bucket. 

Then the old bitch slaps me on the ass again. Tells me, "I'll be back in another hour. Don't you go anywhere." The door shuts. And she's gone. 

This time, she comes back with someone who's brand new. Who's training. A trainee.

They want to make sure to maximize my loads, right? Make sure they can take all they can. So there's these experiments. Make sure they maximize their profits. And lucky me, I get to be the first to have them experienced. So now not only do I have this old ladies hand wrapped around my flesh rocket. The girl they got training today is rubbing jelly on what looks like a traffic cone with knobs all around and over. 

The trainee places the head of the traffic cone against my asshole. Before this, they attach a breathing apparatus that attaches itself through a serious of tubes to a canister labeled Alkyl nitrites. The old lady explains to the trainee, "It's like forcing a kid to go to school, there's lost of screaming and resistance, so it helps his body relax. And we heat the tip, here, see? And then it's knife through butter."

I feel the heat and then the trainees body weight, and she presses. Until all that was outside is now in. Then the vibrating starts.  

And I wince, and I cry a bit. It hurts. I can feel it hit my stomach. The old lady and the trainee move in unison. Hold lady tugs at me, while the trainee pistons in and out. Every five minutes or so they stop to take a break. 

"Make sure you use your shoulders, push with your shoulders," The old lady says, pointing to the trainee shoulders, "In a couple of weeks he'll be lose enough we won't even have to use the jelly. But you can still hurt yourself, you know? Safety first."

It starts again. My balls purge themselves into the bucket. The old lady slaps me on the ass and says she'll see me in another hour. 

Then again. And again. And again. 

They even have a taste testing.

I can see the bucket through my watery eyes. My pearl greatness rocks back and forth. A door opens and shoes walk in. They take the bucket and place it a few feet from me. And with small spoons the ladies take small samples like they're dining with fine caviar. 

"Oh, this is delicious," one says. 

"This will bring so many wonderful boys and girls." Says another. 

"Here, try it on a biscuit."

Then they leave. And I wait another hour. And it starts again. 

Not all is bad. Mum always told me to look for the positive in things.

And now I have company.  

A day ago someone came looking for me from the past.

And now he hangs a few feet from me. His sobbing keeps me up at night. But what I go through is like skipping through a field of daisies and candy canes compared to him. 

Is his name Michael? Or Greg? Maybe Davis? I don't remember. I remember his voice. He broke down what my body would feel when I entered the machine. What the trip might be like (even though I don't remember.) He's a nice guy. It hurts to hear him cry like this.  

Every day we wake up together. I can hear him yell: "No! No! What are you doing! Stop it! Stop it! Just tell me what I need to do and I can change this! I can go back to the past and change this! Tell me what men did wrong! Tell me what happened to them! And I can fix this! I can go back and fix this!"

They just laugh. Then, they take a metal pipe and place it over a growing fire. When it glows amber, they take the pipe and places it on the edge of his penis. Which one of the ladies explain to the other, "This is something new, but it should help the process go much faster, you see number one over there?" She points to me, "He takes about fifteen to twenty minutes to milk. And then we need to give his body an hour to recover." She shows the trainee the glowing hot pipe. "This will cauterize his urethra. This will make for a smooth exit. So it pours instead of spurts of them." And then she shoves the metal rod into his penis. They have to cover his mouth so they can speak. 

"See? We do this for a couple days, and then by Friday it will take him only minutes to empty. The less friction, the better." 

Should I feel proud? No, not really. They're not coming in here and milking Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know? It's just some bloke who works at a petrel station and waits tables on the weekend. I signed up for this "experiment" because rent was past due and I needed the money. And now I wish I was suffering under my own roof. Not knowing that millions of my babies will be born from my seed.

This isn't going to go on forever. Maybe a few years? Just enough of me to keep humanity going. After that I don't know what they'll do with me. I just hope it's quick. 

Ten days so far, and it's not getting any better. Millions of my children will be born. And little do they know their father hangs daily being tugged at by an old woman, listening to the sound of my tears hit the concrete.

I'm reminded of a quote as I hang here waiting for the next session.

"Behind every beautiful thing, there's some kind of pain."

Was there something beautiful about my situation? 

I wager death will find me way before I find out. 

Until then, I wait for an answer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What if you're on a airplane that crash lands on an island that for thousands of miles all you can see is vast open blue sea. (The island is also big enough so a plane can crash, skid for hundreds of yards and not just plow into the ocean and you drown in the process) You're the only survivor ( all the bodies  somehow just didn't make it to the crash site)(and for sake of the question, everything the plane could possibly be tracked with disintegrates for some reason that could not be figured out for hundreds of years) and you're searching the wreckage for food. The only things you manage to find is boxes and boxes  and boxes of edibles. (I don't know, make up why an airplane would just have boxes of edibles.) Candies, brownies, cookies, gummies, and for some reason a bunch of frozen pizzas. It could be months before anyone finds you (or if some of you are super hardcore, let's say a few years) How do you go about rationing the food not only for your survival but your sanity? </TEXT>

<TEXT> David sets his cane by the door, shutting it behind him. He takes a few deep, deep breaths. And heads to the kitchen where he puts his keys and checks the calendar. 

June 27th 

"David, I'm readyyy." a voice calls from upstairs. 

He looks at the plastic bag in his hands, it's all they had left. He wasn't the only husband sent out to fetch--

"David, please hurry." then a pause for effect, "Now."

He take a few breaths and checks his watch, this shouldn't take long, he thinks. Several hours maybe, maybe longer. 

He goes to the bottom of the stair case and stares into a mirror. Same mirror his eyes watched him grow from a boy into a old man. Same mirror he looked into when the news came, that the day that what was normal was to be switched, become opposite. So abiding by this new law, and the good man he is--

"David, I do not want to call your name again. Get up here, now."

He takes a breath, nods his head to himself in the mirror, and heads up stairs. 

He walks into the bedroom and closes the door behind him. He can see easily due to hundreds of lit candles that parade around the walls and flicker still shadows. He sets his coat down on the bed, seeing his wife of forty-five years standing in the doorway of the bathroom. 

"Happy Opposite Day," she says, and her robe falls. She's naked, except for a strap on penis nine inches long and six inches in diameter stands proudly from her waist, it's was like a toddlers arm balled into a fist that was ready to enter him from the tip and all the way down to the base. 

He takes the item out of the plastic bag, handing it to her. 

"All they had was canola oil, they were out of, you know... "

"Lay down, and on your back."

He nods, and slips out of his shoes and pants. He lays on the bed and states at the ceiling fan. Such slow monotonous circles, he thinks. Hoping the spinning of the blades will hypnotize him and take his mind far and away. 

He feels his legs go on her shoulders, his back cracks, and his hips. He should've stretched, but didn't have the time earlier, so he winces on slightly, grabs the edges of the bed on both sides with his hands and calms himself, and relaxes. Calm. And relaxed. 

She enters, and the night begins.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It Was Necessary - /u/KillerSealion has my vote. I thought it was engaging, creative on how it implemented the flashback, the language used in the dialogue, and most importantly, it kept my attention. Details can be a sea of information and sometimes I don't want to drown in it, especially in a short story. The 2000 word count to me also seemed like it was on purpose, so maybe extra words found their way in there to be exactly 2000 word story. a lot of fat that could have been shaved, even saying that, great story. High five, hand shake, hug, long walk on the beach, and so on.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great story, was it your aim to have exactly 2000 words?  Because through the story - - for me-- there's so many words that didn't have to be there. There's a lot of fat that could have been shaved, but then again, pacing is also important, every word you cut help the reader speed up and everyone you have helps the reader slow down. Also, the language in the dialogue, I thought it a little rigid in the beginning but it's smoothed out very well later.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> She's cold. 

Manual Espinoza holds his baby girl walking up the stairs. Passing frames of photos from phones he was able to salvage before the power went out. 

"Daddy," she whispers. 

He knows the question is coming. He holds her tighter. 

"Daddy, do I have to go in there?"

He finishes the last of the steps, and sets her down. Her color is almost all gone. 

But, he thinks, she's still the most beautiful thing in his world. 

"Bonita, sweetie.. " He takes his hands and holds her eyes.  "You're very special to me. Maana, in the morning. You can come back out."

She says," I have nightmares. I want to sleep with you and mommy."

"What nightmares, sweetie," He takes hand and places it on the side of her head, her hand touches his and she whispers. 


"I'm screaming. Except it's not me." She leans in closer, as if to tell a secret, "It looks like me, Daddy. It screams, a lot. I don't like it."

He picks her back up and follows the wall all the way to the end of the hallway. 

10 locks. Five chains. Two doors. 

He sets her down."Stay right here."

He unlocks one lock at a time. Removes the chains. Opens the first door. And then the second. He holds out his hand while turning on a light inside. "Sweetie, come here." 

Red blemishes slowly form around her eyes, arms, and neck. By the second the red becomes deeper, more rich. 

He takes her hand and kneels. He's careful not to touch her hair. Last time a small chunk of it came out. She cried all the next day about how she felt ugly. 


"Both palms, open them."

She opens both her hands, holding them out in front. Miguel slips on leather gloves on both hands. With a velcro strap, he wraps it around her wrists and secures it. He holds her cheeks. The white in her eyes is gone.

"Daddy," she leans in close, "Please, Daddy. I do--" 

She lurches forward. He doesn't even think. He picks her up and sets her inside on her feet. But she falls over, convulsing. Clawing at her face. 

He shuts the first door, then the second. Attaches the chains. Locks the locks. 

He backs away from the door. She's screaming. She's up now and he can hear her feet thumping on the hardwood floor. He takes a breath, turns around and heads back downstairs. 

Miguel walks into the kitchen, and takes a seat at the table. 

"Locked?"

A tender voice comes from behind, and then arms wrap themselves around his neck. 

"Locked." He says.

<TEXT> Ten days ago I stepped out of that machine. I felt the dirt in my toes. The heat from the sun. I was alive. I made it. 

But made it where? Where was I? Well, we guessed, the desert, they tried to put me there. But downtown San Francisco was where I ended. There, naked, standing in front of hundreds of faces that just stared. Like I was a shooting star. 

It felt good, for a moment. Until I found out what they were staring at.

Currently, my legs and arms are chained to metal that during the day hangs me face down. And I'm what you called "milked" daily. 

Don't worry, I tried to tell them I could do it myself. How it's actually fun. All they had to do was supply pictures of Asian women and their feet and I was locked and loaded. 

The problem.. 

Apparently men are completely extinct , meaning there's no men to take their seed and put into some pretty ladies stink cave and give birth to walking cancer. So. Me, having the wonderful balls I have, came to that point in time where balls have gone extinct and my healthy, hearty coconuts we're looked at like rare precious metals. 

They cum me twenty times a day. A day. In ten hours, they send some in some old lady. Old, haggard ass lady! They send her in, she jerks me until I go into this cup, she pats me on the ass and goes "See you in a bit."  Leaving me in the dark. 

But that's my role now. I'm a time traveler chained and milked the last ten days because my precious man seed will continue the species. 

Should I feel proud? No, not at all. They're not coming in here and milking Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know? I can read, add single digit numbers, but I work at a gas station. I'm 36 years old. I volunteered for this experiment that was supposed to pay my rent for the next three months. I sign some paper work, and... 

Well, ten days so far, and it's not getting any better. I am to be milked over and over again until millions and millions of my children are born. Millions and millions of dumb asses like me. And little do they know their father hangs daily being tugged at by an old woman listening to the sound of my tears hitting the concrete. 

Will it ever end? Who knows...

<TEXT> It's a mini van. Two adults, three kids. Smiles are pouring out of them because guess where they're going? Yes, Disneyland. (Daddy was able to get the weekend off because Richard needed the hours.)

And they drive laughing, smiling. It's a piece of metal going sixty miles per hour and it's filled with love, okay? Filled with love and dreams and life...You see where I'm going with this? Do you? 

People pretend I don't know they think about me at night, I know they do, everyone does. 

I was human, yeah, I don't remember how long ago. Being Death doesn't free you from empathy. It tears at you just the same. Tears at your gut, like this family that did nothing wrong. They will be rear ended by a drunk driver, and their van will hit a car, flip over, and everyone inside will die. And I take what I need. Pretend I don't hear their souls screaming. And I leave.

It always tears. 

And it's on to the next, on to the next, on to the next.. 

I don't know how long I've been doing this, I don't know how long I'll be doing this for. I know when there's a call, a person to be taken, and I try to fight it, I try to not move, not take another soul, the burning comes. Agony is a back massage compared to the burning I feel if I don't move, if I try and not take another. If I fight it. 


I'm bound by density or the Sands of time. I move with it or burn. I have no choice but to take what's needed. 

You know what's the worst? The absolutely worst fucking thing? The screaming. It never ends. Everyday, for weeks, and hundreds of years, the constant begging and screaming. 

It never goes away.

<TEXT> When you're in a bad mood, or just pay attention to your emotions when you smoke in general. I know this doesn't apply to everyone, but weed does make you hyper sensitive. So it's going to maybe enhance a emotion or state more than dull it, for example, if you're elated or happy, toke up. If you're depressed, don't go for the weed just yet, try and let the moment pass, because you could be digging yourself a bigger hole than with what you began with. (Not to say that weed doesn't treat depression, because I know it can, but I had to learn the hard way that smoking weed to help combat it just made things worse.)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "I didn't say I wanted God's Orgasm,    I said I wanted Infinity and Beyond..." 

Buying bud lately, not going to lie, has been a pain in the ass. 

So, recently, Society has legalized Marijuana, (actually, all drugs.) and now just a hop, skip, and maybe a tumble,( depending on how much I've had to drink that day) away. 

I can go and by myself weed..

But, now, I'm staring at this very angry Mexican woman (who's fuckin hot, all budtenders are, you don't want to woman with a face that looks like it was hit with a fire hydrant trying to sell weed.) with her arms crossed, pretending she can't hear me... 

"Infinity and Beyond?"

"Yes... " I try and say as patiently as possible. She turns around and scans the glass fish tanks filled with various types of weed with honestly the weirdest names (ever since cooperations got involved) : Sour sour, Angelina's Breath, Lights Out, Lights On, Paper Planes and of course, my favorite, Infinity and Beyond. The one I want, she can't seem to navigate and find. And I can't tell if she's doing that on purpose. 

"It's right up there, next to... "

"Sir, please, I'm going to ask you very nicely, do not tell me how to do my job."

"I'm not telling you how to do your--" 

"Sir!" She walks over to me, firming her voice. "Sir, I'm going to ask you again, you're not going to tell me how to do my job... "

"Look, can I talk to your manager? Please?"

"Oh, you want to talk to my manager? Yeah, you can." She turns and yells, "Michael!" 

A man comes out from the back, blue shirt, black tie, smiles and he adjust his glasses reaching to shake my hand. 

"Hey, the names Michael, how can I help you?"

"Hey, Michael, look, I'm not trying to be a pain in the ass, but, uh, Monica over here, I'm trying to show her where the Infinity and Beyond is but--" 

"Wait." Michael stops me, "Just so I'm understanding you correctly, you were trying to tell her how to do her job?" 

"Yes, he was! He was telling me how to do my job."

I shook my head, "Look, I'm just trying to show her, well, more like help--" 

"I'm going to have to ask you leave, sir. I'm sorry." Michael says, pointing to the door, "We can't have you telling our employees how to do their jobs, they are highly trained professionals and we can't have you try and tarnish that, Good day."

He points again, and I turn around and walk out to the store. 

This is the last time I'm ever going to buy weed from a dispensary owned by Comcast.

<TEXT> I think it's a combination of not knowing what to do in these types of situations and processing the situation. How many times do skaters slam and just bolt right back up? Obviously, nobody is a medical expert there so when someone does slam and it looks bad, they probably tense up and the best they can do IN THAT MOMENT is go, "Hey, dude, you alright?" They just don't know enough to do what you're expecting them to do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Pretty Girl** [1000]


"Do you want water? Water? Drink, drink?"





She said it so slowly. I wanted to stop this. This, act. But, I held back. Pulling on my tie, nodding.

"Yes. Yes." I said

And she turned around filling the red plastic cup in her hand with water.

The music bumped, and kids all around me dancing, having fun, laughing. Just completely lost in themselves, I mean it's prom, right? This is an important night for them, and me? I'm just here, with the girl I can't stop staring at, thinking I'm *fucking retarded*.

Well, okay, not like I have down syndrome, but just, how did she say it? She was so direct about it... 

A couple days ago, I was in the library (like usual) on Reddit, just minding my own business. And then I felt someone staring at me, and it was her, Angela Firebaugh. 

She moved over, sat down next to me, and looked me deep into my eyes and asked if I could go to prom.

I just got Star Wars Battlefront. That is what I was going to do during prom. I never had a lot of friends, so I didn't see a point to go and just chill against the wall and have people ask me why I'm not dancing. *Uh, because I'm not desperate for attention and the all the music you guys like, sucks?*  

Nope, I couldn't be honest like that. The plan was to be home, in bed, having people younger and older people call me faggot.

It happened very quickly, she asked if I can go, and then ever so softly, she rested her hand on my knee, and said, "I know you're autistic, that doesn't make you any less cute."

And look, I'm here with this fucking beautiful vessel I try and not glance at during class. And she thinks I have *autism*.

I can't blame her how she's acting, it's not like there's a how to yet on YouTube how to deal with those who are, uh, "different."

"Here, sit, sit, you like sitting?" Angela asked, moving out a chair for me.

I just nodded my head, I don't know how autistic people talk, I saw the documentary on some guy called the Rain Man awhile ago, that's about how far my research goes.

I sat on the chair and took a small sip of the cold water. My classmates still danced all around to the sounds of Lana Del Ray.

"You having fun? Fun?"

I nodded, again. I smiled and looked around.

"Lots of people," I said. 

"Yeah, lots of people." She stared at me for a moment. "You know, you look very handsome."

I couldn't help but smile. As if those were the keywords to control the muscles in my face. Hey, you take what you can get right?

This was a bold move on my end, I looked at her, and tried to say as simply as possible. 

"Pretty girl." 

It felt like I jumped off a cliff, that is the closest I've ever come to complimenting her. I mean, I wanted to say so much more, I didn't even know how to put Angela into words, I would need several encyclopedias to have enough words to begin to describe the magnitude on how beautiful I thought she--"

"Alright, let's cut the bullshit."

My eyes widened immediately, I almost spilled my drink. I retained control of my body, keeping it still.

I tried to ask as innocently as possible, "...bullshit?"

"Yes, look, obviously, I didn't ask you to come to prom to be my date, but I do need you. I'm sorry I didn't notice it before. But when Jeff told me you had autism, it *totally made sense*."

That motherfucker! Jeff, he's in my math class. He's always been a dick to me, and for some dumb reason I told him I had a crush on Angela, and he even said he wouldn't say anything! But he does the next worse thing! He tells her I have autism??

"Look, Charlie, it's okay. I know you're not wired right, there." she said,  pointing to my skull. "But what I care about, is that you're wired right... here...."

I thought my entire body being held. She looked at me right in the eyes, and firmly held in her soft hands, my balls. 

I tried my best to keep my composure, glancing around to see if anyone was capturing this moment, but nope, just me, and her. 

She gripped me a little harder, controlling me and making sure I was listening, pulling me closer.  "I told Nathan Hawkins I would lose my virginity to him, and he said he would lose his to me. But, I don't want to embarrass myself, you understand? I want to blow his fucking mind, and so, since you have that condition, I know you can't judge me. And that means I want to practice on you."

The mellow beats continued, my classmates moved and laughed, and my balls still in this gentle vice grip of the girl from Fantasy and Sci-fi English.

Everything seemed to slow down for a moment, and I pondered my options on how this night was going to end. 

Well, I could, tell her no, tell her the truth. Tell her, I don't have autism, and go right home.

Or, I could tell her last week in the locker room I heard Nathan Hawkins talk about having sex with Marina Garcia in his room, and I can still remembering him barking about it, "Oh my god, man. She let me cum all over her tits, it was amazing!"

Or, I could just play along, and lose my virginity to the most beautiful thing in school.

She still stared into my eyes, slowly beginning to smile as I could see how hungry she was. 

I know I don't know shit, but as I get older, I keep wondering... 

Why, oh, why, is it so hard, to do the right thing? </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Tony, sit down!"

Tony's mom screamed, again. 

"No!" Eleven year old Tony moved away from the table, pointing at her, "You, silence! You will not tell the great creator what to do!" 

"Mark, are you just going to stand there?"

"Susan. I'm trying. Tony, *come on, man.* Why are you talking like that? Come back and sit down." Mark moved over and extended his arms, reaching for Tony. 

"Father! How dare you try and touch the omniscient one!" Tony moved away from his Dad's hairy hands, moving by the older couple who sat behind them. 

The waitress came over, trying to force a smile, "Hi, ma'am, I'm so sorry, is there any way you can have your son, like, stop screaming?"

"Oh! Who is this blonde goddess?" Tony said, pointing his fork at the waitress, "Would you like to spend an evening with a God?" 

"Tony!" Susan shouted. 

"Son, you can't say that to strangers, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, miss."

The waitress just smiled and turned away. 

The older couple tried their best not to be annoyed as Mark chased his young Tony in and around tables. 

"You will not catch me mortal man! For I am too quick and as fast as ligh--"

Mark clasped his arms under and brought up Tony quickly, turning around and facing the table. "I'm sorry everyone, I'm sorry."

Mark turned and walked with Tony still in his arms. 

"Let me go you, mortal man! I demand you release me!" 

Mark managed to wrestle Tony outside, having him sit on the bench. Mark sighed heavily, "Tony, can I ask you something."

"Yes, mortal man."

"How often do me and your mom get to come here to Outback."

"Maybe.. I don't know.. Not often..." 

"Okay, You see? Tony, you're a great kid. But your mom busts her ass to keep that gel in your hair and that your stomach full. You see where going with this?"

Tony's smiled faded, slowly nodding his head.. 

"You mother doesn't get to go out often. If you ruin this I will... Remember that movie The Human Centipede we found in your room a couple months ago?"

Tony nodded slowly. 

"I will literally sow your mouth to my asshole and shit into your stomach for weeks. Is that clear."

Tony nodded his head. 

"Hey, you guys okay?" Susan said from Outback steakhouse door, "I'm waiting for you in there."

"Tell your mom you're felling better." Mark said, grabbing Tony's shoulder. 

Tony smiled, and turned to his mom and said. 

"No! This horrible hairy man's arm is on my all knowing shoulders! Tell him to back away at once!"

<TEXT> "Your sword and your shield can be placed right there."

"And my necklace of heads?" 

The tall man asks, not sure to place the necklace of decapitated skulls on my desk, or on the floor. 

"The floor please," I say, pointing to a nice spot for the tall man to put his trophies, "My desk is a mess as it is." 

The tall man sets the necklace down, with the sword and shield, and sits in the chair in front of me. I cycle through paper work on my desk, gosh, it was always a mess. 

I didn't really think anyone would show up, you know? But, we had a deal...

"Alright, so, uh.."

"Thomas.." the tall man says, adjusting himself in the chair. 

"Thomas, okay, so, the world, has ended, and I see you're doing a good...with the whole surviving thing.."

"I had to eat my neighbor, his wife and his kids! I carrying them with me everywhere I go, reminders of my victories.." Thomas looks down at the skulls on the floor.

"Ah, I see, well, it goes great with the... attire you've decided to wear."

Thomas looks down and back to me, "It's made from old bedding, and some of my old hunting gear, you like it?"

"Oh, yes, it's, you know what, it's definitely "in" but let's get down to why you're here."

"Yes," Thomas says, leaning forward, "I paid you guys $150 every month for the last five years."

"Yes," I say looking at the paperwork, "on time, every month too."

"The misses was always all over me about paying the bills on time... You want to meet her?"

"You brought your wife?"

"Half of her, the other half I couldn't find..."

"I'll pass on seeing your wife, well, I don't want to be rude, you did pay on time for so long. Do you have the top half or the bottom half?"

Thomas shook his head, "No, I have half of her, so an arm, head, leg, and some of her ribs, I told her we would be together forever..."

"Ah, and she's not all together." I say. 

"No, not yet, but anyways. I paid, I paid for so long, and I'm here to make a claim."

I nod my head, "Of course, Thomas, of course. Okay, so that we're on the same page, we both know, that money... well doesn't have any value currently."

Thomas nods his head, "Yes, I know, I burned all my saving to keep me and whisper warm."

"Who's Whisper?"

"My horse."

"Of course, well, Thomas, I'm going to be honest with you. Since the world has ended, and being my office is the only place I could hide out, being there was enough food and water here for the next several months, I really didn't think we would, well, I, would be seeing any of our clients."

"I don't understand," Thomas says, leaning closer, "I paid you guys for five years!"

"Hey! I know, I know, take it easy. Here. Look, I took an oath when I took this job that I would do what I can to ensure all your needs are fit. How about this," I lean in close, whispering to Thomas, "There's a group, not far from here, ten people, maybe fifteen. Why don't you and I, take that nice shield and sword, you can wear your lovely necklace, and we go, take over their supplies?"

Thomas stares at me, then slams his fist down onto my desk. "Deal! You and me, we take everything they have!"

"Yes! We can go--"

There's a knock on my office door, it opens slowly and a heavily bearded man with a blood stained face pokes his head through, "Hey," the man says, "Is this *The End* insurance, is this where I make a claim?"

"... that's the heart... is this a joke?"

I shook my head, "No, no, of course not! It's just, a reminder to me, and of course all of you, where all the red, gross, moving stuff is at, that's all.. " 

Not going to lie. I had no idea what I was looking at. This poor old, wrinkly man. Heart attack, apparently. He was walking up the stairs with his misses, and bam, clutches his chest and like a uncoordinated slinky, he fell all the way down the stairs...

...not knowing I would be the one to try to save his life. 

Try. Keyword here. 

"Alright, so, the heart. Does he need a new one or.."

The nurse who calls herself Jessica glanced over at Manny, the male nurse, (weird right?) and then back to me, "A new one?" 


"Yeah, like, I mean, it's moving now, but how much longer, until... You know... "


"Dr.Chow, I don't see what you're getting at..." 

"You know how sometimes you just miss the bus, and you run after it? Well, maybe, death is driving this bus and, uh, Mr.Martin here... is not that far behind... "

"Dr. Chow, he's only fourty--"

"I'm the doctor. I'm calling it." I looked up over a the clock. "We lost Mr. Martin here at eight fifty eight. He died in his sleep, tell his wife that has last words was I love you and there was always another woman, something sweet..." 


I took off my gloves and started heading to the door.


"Doctor, we can't ju--"


I turned, "Short and sweet, she'll understand."

I ditched the gloves in the sink, open the doors, stepped out and as humanly fast as I possibly could, I ran..

<TEXT> The Detective taps the pen, then begins writing in the yellow notebook. "How long did you work?"

Sparkle laughs, "Hundreds of years. We started work as soon as the sun made it's first appearance in the arctic sky, and long after it set and the moon would shine sheets of light onto the snow below." 

"So, you would work all day?"

"Yeah, all day. Every hour our little hands were busy assembling, reading instructions. You see, we didn't make the toys. That's all bullshit. Santa has a guy in all the counties. They buy the product. Then they move the product fast, too. Nobody ever asks about toys...man, I wish some days, just one day, someone would ask, "Hey, where are these toys going?" just maybe to end this enduring hell..."

"You put together toys?"

Sparkle takes another drag from his cigarette, staring at the wall off to his right. "Yeah, we put together toys. Can you imagine assembling billions of toys for Billions of children? Can you? We worked in lines, but we had to work fast, very fast. Master elves would walk down our line, watching us closely. If we stopped for just a second.." Sparkle pauses, swallowing, "I saw a lot of good elves die, you know? They didn't have to, all they wanted was water...just a small cup.."

"Where was Santa when this was all this was a happening?"

Sparkle moves his head side to side, stretching his neck. "He watched from his office. If I had the chance though, just to take one of these small screwdrivers and go up there and shove it into both of his eyes, over, and over again. It would be so worth my death. But, Death is an easy escape."

"How did you get out?"

"We we're expected a shipment of Ipads and Iphones. I made my way up the ranks through the years, and one of the master elves was on the radio trying to coordinate with the drop. And he turned his back, and every fiber of my being said run, and I didn't even hesitate. I moved as fast as my small legs could carry me. I ran and I ran. And they searched for me too. The worst part was digging out the tracking device they have implanted when they first catch you then send you off to work." Sparkle lifts his shirt up, showing his small,pale bare chest. And in the center of his breast a deep red scar. "I had to dig the device out with a stick. With a fucking stick.." He shakes his head. "I can go on for years and years what I've been through, man. I'm tired. Is it possible if I can catch a nap for a couple days? Maybe if you guys have some hot chocolate you can spare? I can tell you everything..."

"Yeah kid," The detective says, "Sure thing."

The detective walks out of the room, into the room next door. He walks up to the two way mirror, staring at Sprinkles with his arms crossed. 

"So he's lying?" The detective asks. 

Behind the detective he hears a jolly laugh, and then a large man stands, moving over and next to the detective. Holding his own arms close to his chest, using his right hand to stroke his gigantic white and fluffy beard. 

"Sprinkles was always a liar," the giant man says, "He wants to ruin Christmas, you see? I'm glad you guys picked him up. I'll give you half you money now, and as soon as we get him back up north, I'll wire transfer the rest."

The detective smiles, and shakes the big man's hand. "Alright, I'll set it up."

The detective begins to leave the room, opening the door. 

"Hey Detective," The big man says. 

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for doing this, you understanding what you're doing, you know?"

"Yeah Santa," The detective says, smiling, nodding his head, "I'm helping you save Christmas. We'll talk soon."

The detective leaves, closing the door.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "I know this is hard to understand," Dr. Goodman said, leaning back into his chair, setting the folder down on top of his desk. "But this is what we need to do." 

"I don't--" Leah said. She stood by the door, folding her arms. "You can't do anything?" 

"We can, I can.. " Goodman said leaning forward, "But, what it's going to take from me. It's too much." 

"Too much?"

Dr. Goodman leaned forward, opening the folder, "These X-rays, we have no other choice but to amputate. We have to cut off the leg at the thigh, if we don't it will continue to spread, and--" Goodman paused, collecting himself. "You understand these talks are never easy?"

"Yes. I do, I do."

"To put it bluntly, you can't afford my pain, I'm sorry. I know it sounds terrible, I know. But it's the truth. It's too much for me to bare if your insurance can't cover it."

Leah moved from the door to the desk, setting her arms down, "I'm sure there's something you can do. Something, anything?"

Goodman crossed his arms, shaking his head. "No, your insurance doesn't cover the cost. I'm sorry, but the pain will be too much and I charge what I charge due to my skills and experience dealing with these types of situations. I say no, often. This isn't just you. If I didn't have to feel every inch of that blade... " Goodman paused, looking out the window, then back to Leah, "It's too much. I'm sorry Leah.. I'm really sorry." Goodman took off his glasses, setting them on the table. 

Leah folded her arms again, nodding her head. "Thank you doctor...I.. I understand, completely. " She turned, opened the door, and closed it softly. 

She moved down the hallway, passed nurses who smiled meekly, and she smiled back. She walked back into the waiting room. Her eyes scanned the seats until she saw her. 

Leah moved over, smiling, "Hey sweetie." 

"Hi, Mommy!" The little girl smiled, the front two teeth missing. She set down the her crayon on top of the coloring book. "Did you talk to the doctor?"

Lesh kneeled down, placing her hand on her daughter's knee. "Yes, honey..." Leah took a deep breath, exhaling softly. "Sweetie, I have some bad news..."

6000 words in and telling the entire story from a 3rd person perspective. And I went over my last sentence, thinking, *"Man, I should have just written this in 1st person. I've had way more fun in the past with that, I can get into my protagonist's head more, show the audience what he's thinking. But, damn it, I'm already 6000 words in, that means that I have to rewrite what I written, ah man, that's going to take forev...wait, no I don't. I can just keep going, and just start writing in 1st person because this is the first draft. It doesn't matter. Have fun and get the words done."*

Thought I would share this with you kids if you just had the same problem I just had. I don't know if this is a good or bad idea, but it's helping me stay motivated because I was falling asleep at the keyboard before this thought invaded my mind.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Rascal get over here!" Red bellowed from the hot Arizona rock. "Rascal right this minute!"

Rascal came stumbling, trying to keep his heavy body from falling over, he trotted slowly, pulling on his jeans that gravity tugged at. 

"Yes Red, what's you want?" 

"Rascal, Today, what are we doing?" Red asked squinting in the sun, crossing his arms. 

"Rascal, what are we doing? I'm not going to ask again."

Rascal scratched his fat cheek, "Oh duh, of course. We're robbing the train Red, that's what we're doing."

Red exhaled, kicked some dirt, and walked over to Rascal, putting his arm around his neck, "Yes, we're are to rob a train, but Rascal, we put you in charge of getting us the means of running down this train, yes?" Red gritted his teeth, "Is that correct?" 

Rascal stared, wiping his brow, "Yes I did, I got exactly what you wanted."

Red turned to the West, there staring at two shadows side by side. "Rascal we want to catch the train, I told you what you were to get exactly." Red paused, exhaling again, moving his arm off Rascal, pointing in the distance, "And you done got two horses! What are you an idiot!"

"But Red, they didn't have any cheetahs! I looked, and looked I asked everywhere, nobody had any! They may not even in this country! "

"You're lieing! I heard it from a guy in town, fastest land animal. They can move quick, quick enough to ride and take down that train!"

Rascal took of his hat, "I don't think we could ride them, I don't think we can. They're fast because theyre small and--"

"Shut up! We need to think, now we need to go figure out how to stop the train. Rascal, get the gear, we will go kidnap a girl and tie her to the tracks. That'll garenttee to stop the train." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did it. 

I'm staring at my body now, it lays on a bed, my eyes are open and they do not blink. I turn move through the solid door. There's some friction, my essence passes through the door slowly, and I'm out. 

I can't feel the floor, but I move through the hallways quickly, I can't leave my body behind, I don't have much time, maybe a few hours. Few hours is all I needed. 

I hear voices, somewhere off in front of me, to the right, it's... yes. Security guards...Donnie and Chuck. I slow down, It feels like a train trying to stop, my essence has momentum, interesting. 

I move through the wall into the room two guards are talking, I wait.

"Please, Chuck, can we not do this. ...I have to work all night and I'm just not in the mood." Donnie, the younger, obese black guard says to Chuck, adjusting himself in the chair. 

Chuck, in his seventies, moves his chair closer, putting his hand on Donnie's knee, "Donnie, we have to talk about what happened last night."

What happened last night? I move around the office, looking around at a cluttered desk, then to the security cameras...

"Chuck, nothing happened.."

"Yes, something did. My pants fell, and you..."

"Stop it Chuck, I...I don't want to talk about it."

This can't be good. I try to drown out the conversation between Donnie and Chuck as I look around the office, maybe there's a guard's schedule, something to tell me when they come, when they go, give me a window big enough to escape through...

"We made love, just say it."

"Chuck! You know we can get fired for talking about it! Stop it! Nothing happened! We're lucky the camera didn't catch us.."

"Yes, something happened Donnie, you went inside me, you grabbed me, you wanted me, you held me down, you did things, wonderful things..."

I froze, I wish I didn't have ears. I kept trying to ignore the conversation, searching the office, I checked the security cameras, see if maybe--

"Yes, fine Chuck. I wanted you. I thought about it for months, bending you over and giving it to you real good. And I did. Now, it's over. Tomorrow we got new inmates coming in, we have to stay focused. Get this shift over with..."

"I want it again, Donnie"

"No, you know we--"

Chuck moved himself up off the chair, and onto Donnie's lap. 

"I want to ride you again."

I had enough, I can do this some other time, I moved out of the office as quick as I could. 

I moved through the walls, passed doors and through the hall, back into my cell, and back into myself. 

I wake up as if I just started breathing for the first time in months, gasping for air, then. *An idea.*

I begin pounding on the walls, screaming, loud. I pound and pound. Screaming. 

"AH! Help me! I'm crazy!!! Help!!! I'm going to kill myself! Help!"

I scream, and I wait. 

I can hear Donnie's breathing from down the hallway, he buckling his pants as Chuck is close behind him. Both come to my cell, he opens the small metal hole in the door. 

"What the fuck you screaming for?"

I smile, "Well, you got two options, either I tell the Warden about you two love birds and have him fire you both and ruin your life, and reputation, or, you let me go, and say it's an accident, and just give me enough time to escape."

Donnie looks shocked, and began to sweat. Chuck wipes his mouth. 

"How--how do you know?" Donnie asks. 

I smile, and extended my hand through the small metal hole in the cell door, "Deal or no deal?"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The hardest part is pretending you don't notice. 

The sun is already racing across the sky, it's 6 am. Explosions echo softly in the distance. But nobody flinches, because nobody notices. 

But I do, I just don't say anything. 

I try and pretend I don't see the death and destruction. And I've written letters, plenty, to the city asking if there is anything we can do about the constant struggle between existing and trying to survive the mayhem. 
Nobody has gotten back, but I'm still waiting. The mailman was killed twice last week, I'm sure that letter explaining the horrible day to day atrocities and what's going to be done about it is still on its way. 

By noon I'm at work, it's lunch, I'm looking out the window of one of the high rise buildings, eating a sandwich, going over reports, they're due by this weekend, and between trying to get home alive and getting this done on time, I don't know which one I want more.

I work in downtown Los Santos. Oh, and it's about that time again. A passenger plane flying in the distance, Boeing 747, I used to want to fly them as a kid.  The massive plane is making it's way towards me, and it's target is the building. How do I know? It's the twelfth one today to run itself into the building. The plane is the only thing that is ever destroyed, the building, never a scratch. And the people? Nobody notices, nobody ever notices. 

The evening is rolling around, I'm enjoying the lush colorful skies by the beach as I try and relax in the dying rays from the evening sun, going over the day, and what tomorrow might have for me. But now, screaming. I turn to see a car with blood and bodies decorating the hood, the driver inside with three others, I can hear laughter. They always laugh. They never stop, they just keep going, trying to hit as many people as they possibly can. As soon as he's gone, the damage is left behind, nobody cares, nobody notices, and everyone just moves along like nothing happened. 

The day feels like only couple hours past, and it's over. I sit alone in my kitchen, eating pizza. I clean up, and lay in bed, listening to the evening ambiance: Gun shots, screaming, sirens, more sirens, helicopters, more screaming, laughter, helicopters, more sirens, then silence. (For now.) I look at my watch, the seconds fly by as it's already eleven. I'll try to close my eyes, and drown out the noises, trying to sleep. 

I often wonder how long everyone who lives here is going to pretend and not notice the daily carnage, the daily murder, the daily sirens, the daily crashing, the daily hell that visits this beautiful city. Peace will come back, I'm sure of it. "Practice patience" my dad always told me. 

So until then, I'll wait, patiently.

<TEXT> "Put it on!" King shouted through his teeth, the pale light from the basement reflecting off his boney bald head. "Put it on!" 

Justin nodded his head slowly, leaning down and picking up the dress, holding it in his skinny hands as he stood. He knew the dress. The blue and the whites. It was Elsa, from Frozen. 

"Justin, please do not make me wait."

Justin quickly put on the white dress, it was tight, of course. But, oddly fit his figure well. He adjusted then looking at King, who began a slow, satisfied smile. 

"Yes... " he said rubbing himself. "Yes, now, the wig, put the wig on." 

There, on the left of Justin, a white wig. He picked it up from the table, and put it on, turning back to King. 

Kings smile grew, his white crooked yellow teeth shining in the light. He stepped forward. 

"You're my favorite Disney Princess." King said, his cold eyes staring. "Turn around, and bend over."

Justin did not protest in any way, he turned, willingly, and put his hands down on the hard table. He closed his eyes, and heard the soft gentle rumbling, of the starting chainsaw. 

:

"Sir, what are you doing?" 

A kid asked with an innocent curiosity. He was short, and Asian. Wearing Mickey Mouse ears, a shirt that read "Boss Status" with a melting ice cream in his right hand. 

"Sir, he asked again, louder over the noises from people moving behind him. "What are you doing?"

A man bent over, turned and smiled,squinting in the afternoon sun.  He said as he walked back over to the Disney maintenance car, using his hands to shield his eyes. "These bags here? They're filled with food for fish. Nobody knows about the fish. But me, and now you."

The man grabbed a black bag from the back, pickin it up, and then walking back to the moat.

"What's your name boy?" The man asked, grunting, tossing the bag into the water. It floated for a moment, before sinking. 

"Aaron." the boy said. 

"Hey, Aaron," the man turned, putting his hands on his hips, smiling. "Who's your favorite Disney princess?" </TEXT>

UFC using what was said in the past against Kevin seems pretty juvenile.

<TEXT> "Stop it."

"No, I really, Tom, this is different..."

Tom walked over with the New York Times in his fat hand, tossing it onto my lap. 

"Read it Brandon."

"No," I said. "I've read it enough. I've heard enough."

"No, read the words that make that headline, right now. Read it."

I looked at the headline. It's been stained in my brain now. *CURE FOR CANCER. THE ANSWER HAS BEEN FOUND.*

"They don't know, they don't understand what had to be done..."

Tom walked over to the window, the window that was filled the Los Angeles downtown, tall and short buildings sloppily placed together. Behind the buildings the sun was setting, the sky looking like a drunk man water painted it. He placed his hands around his robust waist, turning back to me. "It doesn't matter Brandon, what's done, is done. We found the answer, and you seem to be the only one who has a problem."

"The bodies Tom, They don't understand." I said, leaning back in my chair. "More people had to die, than we're going to save..."

Tom walked over to me, taking out a pocket knife, then began to etch into my desk. 

"Brandon," he said through his teeth as he carved,concentrating. "You're wrong, and your head is stuck in yesterday, last week, the past. This company is always about moving forward. Like a Jet, we have no rear view mirrors. You're going to have to understand, for things to change, great change, for the better good,things have to be lost." 

I should be mad, it's a two thousand dollar desk he was putting a reminder in. I just didn't care, I moved my hand through my hair, it felt sweaty, dirty. Tom folded his pocketknife, placing it back in his front pocket, looking satisfied with what he left.

He said, "This is a reminder, you can look at everyday, it will help. I promise."

He turned and left the office. I peered at what he carved into my desk. 

*millions died so billions can live*

The doctor whispers, leaning over, next to Alan's ear.

*I'll take care of you Alan, I will. You sorta know who I am, but I know you better. You know me only as the doctor who is going to help fix your knee, but I've been watching you, your family, your girls at home. I have a hobby, I like to paint, and you've most likely seen my paintings on the news, the news acting like bee's around a hive every time one of my paintings are discovered. So, just know, while you're under Alan, I'll will go to your house, your family who has met me already,will trust me, and I will bring muffins, tasty ones, your family will enjoy, and after they doze off, I will take your family apart, piece by piece Alan, and I will paint the inside of your house with your wife and your little girls blood. What's even better, you won't even remember me telling you any of this. I hope inside your screaming Alan, pain is my art, and your family will be my expression.*

<TEXT> "Yeah it's smooth, a constant flow of sinners, you know. The usual." Augustine said, moving one of his bulky red veiny arms over to the sugar, pouring it in his coffee. "You?" 

"Me? Oh well. You know. God has pretty high demands, you know. It's like we're seeing less and less pure souls every year." Gabriel said, taking a sip of his coffee. "It's interesting. Thousands of years I worked for him, first time I've seen him worried."

"Worried?" asked Augustine, taking a sip of his own coffee, moving his head carefully, making sure his horns didn't hit one of the lamps hanging above the table. "Why is he worried?" 

"Oh, if he will have to end the world or not. You know. Put an end to it all. I'm sure he's pretty stressed. But humanity was a big investment for him." Gabriel paused for a moment, looking out the window, watching a breeze kick up some of the cloud the coffee house floated on. "I hope he doesn't end it. It be sad see him lose all of that." 

"Well, it be great business for us." Augustine said, chuckling. Gabriel couldn't help but laugh himself. 

"I'm sure it be fine, Look," Augustine rested both his elbows on the table. "Maybe it's just a phase, I mean, come on. We bring balance to the universe. We torture and mangle those who deserve it, and you bring light and joy, all that happy shit to those who deserve it. We all play a part. I don't imagine God creating an unbalance like that to the universe, just because he was worried?" Augustine took another sip of his coffee, looking out the window himself. "I'm sure it's going to be fine, you'll see."

" You're probably right" Gabriel said. "Anyways, I got to get going. Next Sunday? Same time?" 

Augustine smiled, showing his corn like sharpened teeth. "Yeah, next week same time, your turn to pay." </TEXT>

<TEXT> She always told me I was a good girl. 

I know I'm a good girl. 

But how long is right back?

I sat, still wagging my tail. My paws digging into the wet earth below me. I watched looking the passing cars, which drove very, very fast. 

Why do they have to go fast? What's the hurry? I never seen so many cars go in one direction, thousands, I think, maybe more? I do hope they slow down, they might hurt someone. 

And how long is right back? It's so strange. Mommy always told me that when she left to go do things outside home. And I would wait for her looking out the window at the driveway knowing she would be pulling up any minute. 

Today she told me we're going for a walk (I love walks, they're the best.) We got out of the car, she tied my leash to this metal pole, she hugged me (Mommy always gave the best hugs ever, this one was a little longer than usual, she squeezed me nice and good) tight and said "I'll be right back sweetie." 

Then, she left. 

And I'm still waiting for her pull up, well, she wouldn't be pulling up to a driveway, but this dirty, disgusting road. Gross. My paws, caked in this wet dirty, and my beautiful fluffy tail, filthy! All of it was gross. I can't wait for mommy to see all the gross, dirty dirt. Oh! And maybe give me a warm bath when we get home! Oh, mommy always knew how to give nice warm baths. I don't like the soap though, it tastes gross. Nasty gross. 

But seriously though, how long is right back?

Not that I mind. It's nice out, but lonely. I don't like being by myself. It's getting cold, too. The sky is all dark, I'm scared of the dark. But Mommy doesn't know that. When it gets dark I just cuddle with her on her bed and she makes me feel real safe. 

Oh! Maybe, yes. Maybe Mommy's helping those strange men move those boxes outside? Mommy had been putting her things in the boxes the last couple days, talking on her phone a lot too. That has to be it. Mommy always was kind, she loved helping, and petting my belly. (Hands down, best belly rubs ever, in the history of forever.) 

:

...It's colder now, and less of those fast cars are moving on the street in front of me, and it's quiet. Really quiet. I wish she would come now. I don't want to wait anymore. I'm starting to shiver, and I'm hungry. And every time I see bright lights my tired tail starts wagging. I want to see her car.  

Maybe I shouldn't worry. Any minute now Mommy will come untie me from this stupid pole, and take me home.

I sprawled out in the gross dirty, and keeping my legs close,to keep warm, resting my head on my paws, staring at the empty street. 

I'm a good girl, and Mommy will be right back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "David?"

"Yes father."

"Could you come closer?"

The mechanical hum began, David rolling his two wheels, bringing the rest of his body to the side of the bed. A single red eye scanned the body that laid there. 

"Father, what is wrong?"

"Oh, David, there's no need to worry now."

"But you programmed me to worry. I must know what is happening."

Davids father leaned forward in the bed, coughing. "David, I'm afraid our time together will be cut shorter than I expected."

"I don't understand." David rolled closer. "Our time together? Are you leaving?"

"You can say that." Davids father said smiling. 

"Where are you going?" David asked, still examining his father. 

"David, it's not important..."

"No, You programmed me to ask questions. Questions that I would need to solve, find answers to. Where is it you're going?"

"David, forty years ago you laid in pieces on my college dorm room desk, you didn't even have a name yet, now, David look in the mirror." 

David rolled over to the mirror, looking at himself. "I see me." Turning around David rolled back. "Why would you show me, me?" 

"David, you're my masterpiece. You're years of hard work. You're everything my life was meant to be, to build you. David, I'm sorry, but this body I'm in, it's failing. I don't have much time."

"Father, do you need repairs? I'm sure I can find something in the lab to help..." 

"No, No, David, that isn't necessary."

"Where is it you're going?"

"I'm dying David."

The red eye flickered. "Dying? No. Father. Surely, you are mistaken.."

"No, David it's true. I'm dying."

David rolled back a little, before rolling forward again. "Are you scared?" 

"Scared? No, no David. I'm not scared."

The red light flickered again. "Father, I am scared. I know death, I know what it means. But I didn't know you would ever be infected with it." 

"David, There's no need to be scared, or worry, this is my curse. Not yours."

David red eye flickered again. "I cannot help but feel upset father. I just find an answer to keeping you alive."

"David, I will find the answer to the question you have. But it's not here in this body, and I won't have it until my--" Davids father coughed heavily. "David, could you do one last thing for me."

"Of course father, anything." David rolled closer to the bed urgently. 

"Can you play one last song for me?"

"Which one father?"

"Oh my Angel, Bertha Tillman. "

There was a pause before the music began to play from David. 

*Oh my Angel... Come back to me...*

<TEXT> Mountainous heaps of colored metal that rested on round rubber circles scattered the landscape. The day was hot, the wind was...windy. 

*I can do this,* Tim thought. 

Tim had been carried away from his web by a random gust of wind. He knew where his home was. It was beyond colored metal. He knew if he tried, and if he gave it his best, him and all eight of his legs could move quickly enough across the hot black asphalt, but he had to make sure to not meet the bottom of the giant flesh beings shoes. They were everywhere. Tim had to be most careful. 

He moved quickly. His legs moved in unison, one after another, he moved his small body across the parking lot. 

Another gush of wind! Tim lowered his body, feeling the wind try and pick him off the ground! Two of his legs dangled in the air! Then, the wind died.Tim collected himself and continued forward. 

Tim passed several more of the giant metal bodies, looking up at them as he passed. He had seen them before, but never so many, so orderly, lined up next to each other. Each one a few feet apart as they lined the--

Then suddenly one of the giant vehicles pulled in front of him! Tim tumbled in the wind that was generated by the rotating piece of rubber that moved in front of him!

The giant metal object paused, Tim look up at it. 

"Ha!" Tim bellowed. "How dare this mighty vehicle think it can defeat me! I may be small! I may be tiny! But you can never keep me from getting home! If I have the will! I will find the wa--"

Silence. 

A small flesh being looked at his shoe from the open door from the moving giant piece of metal, exclaiming. 

"MOM! I STEPPED ON A SPIDER!"

<TEXT> "Hi I'm Bill, and I'll be in charge of your training."

Training? I rub my eyes but see nothing but a brilliant white. It's empty, only a tall black man in all white stares at me with a wide smile.

"Hey! Confused man looking around." Bill said trying to get my attention. "Can you see me?" He waves his hand in front of my face. 

"Yes, Yes, I can see you," I said. 

"Oh good, sometimes the contrast of my skin to my suit throws people off, anyways, did you hear the part about how I'm Bill, oh, and how I'll be in charge of your training?"

"Yes. I heard that, what happened?"

Bill walks over to me and puts his hands on my shoulders. "Ah, it's like telling a small boy he's going to become a man, well, I have good news and some bad news."

Bill began to walk and gestured for me to follow. 

"Good news is your dead," Bill said as he walked. 

"How is that good news?"

"Well, you don't have to live that life you were living anymore, come on, did you seriously find any joy in being a cashier at Walmart?"

"Well, No, how do you kno--"

"We know everything, Just try to keep up." Bill said as he turned his head, smiling. We continued to walk forward in the white void. 

"What's the bad news?" I asked. 

"Oh there's no bad news, I just like cliche's, Oh here we are."

A window appeared at the end of the white void, I see could the blue sky and trees beyond it. 

We approached and Bill moved ahead of me quickly. "Come here, look." He said pointing to the window. 

I came to and saw a fat boy sitting on the grass outside. He sat in a white shirt, blue basketball shorts, reading a book in the grass. 

"What's with the kid?"

"Oh, you will be his guardian," Bill said, grabbing one of my shoulders. "I will teach you how to guardian, see this boy here, even though he's fat, has no friends, and appears to be destined to work at a gas station for the rest of his life, He actually is very, very important. And there's many of them, like this fatass, we need to protect, and you." Bill grabbed my shoulders. "I will teach you everything I know, and when we're done, I will send you back to Earth, and you will not only be his guardian, but his guide."

I looked at the fat kid again who began to dig into his nose with his finger, then wiping if off on the book. 

"Will he know who I am? Will he be able to see me?"

Bill shook his head and smiled, "No you goof, this is why we have training, now, Come with me over here, and we'll begin day one on how to be a guide, a protector for that adorable fat little slob outside."

Bill began walk away from the window, gesturing me to follow. "Come now, Come come." </TEXT>

They did it, they found a cure. 

I held the piece of paper in my hand that had my name and the news on it. 

*Because of your condition you are automatically enrolled in new treatment procedures, please contact the number provided for immediate care.*

My mom was still crying to my grandma on the phone. "My baby is going to be okay! Yes! He's going to be okay."

I smiled and turned to walk outside, the sun was out and the skies were blue, not a single cloud in the sky. 

I get to live, I get to see fifty. I get to have kids, everything has changed. 

I walked out to the sidewalk and look both ways down the empty street, then raised my face up to the sun feeling the heat on my skin and my head. I rubbed my bald head, feeling it. 

I can grow hair again. 

I fell backwards on the grass, smiling, laughing, moving my hands through it. Everything was different now! I get to live! Fuck! I get to have a girlfriend, I get to drive a car, I get to--

I paused as I felt the sun disappear, a great giant shadow enveloped me and the rest of the neighborhood. I looked up see a mammoth fireball moving across the blue sky, a heavy grey and black smoke streaked from it. 

 I heard my mom scream from behind me. 

"David! Inside! Now!"

Donald, please, you're perfect, your life is in shambles, your life is so pathetic, you're such an inspiration, imagine all the people I could torture if I could just recreate your own personal Hell for them. Don't do it for me, do it for the sinners." </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Ah, yes, those days Margaret, those days where magical. Oh, I remember it so vividly, back in the summer of 2015,  I found a little spunky app called Tinder. It was quite interesting, it was like a vending machine for boys, you could literally order them and the delivered themselves they did. It was quite wonderful Margaret, I remember those nights, Oh Margaret I shouldn't be telling you these things, but I remember those nights I needed a good stretching, and I would go to that little tinder app, find me a man-- even though most of them were pubescent little bitch boys-- talk for just a moment, then have him over, or them, do the do, and I just never had to talk to any of them ever again. Oh Margaret, it was so wonderful, that was a lovely summer, please, though, don't let me carried away with my stories, Margaret, I'm sorry interrupted in the middle of yours. Okay, so, your mouth was half-full with that fine young man you met on that old Facebook website, then what happened..?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was always is

"What the fuck does that mean?"

Please, I'll explain. 

Is, is this. And this, is all that.

And all of that.. 

.. Is this. 

Infinity is a word that is lofted around like a baseball at mentally disabled baseball game; you got to make sure everyone gets a chance to hit the ball.

Infinity is that baseball, we toss around, because we think we know what it means, but the meaning is so much deeper. 

This is all a cycle, you have lived this life before. And you will live it again. To put it in perspective for them small tiny microscopic brains, let's say your life was a song in an Ipod, that is set on repeat, Your little precious song just plays over and over and over and over and..

... you get it? 

There is not start or end, there is just no before.

 I mean, 

think about how many times you walked down the street, there's a is a million different things you can do at any given moment: take a dump on the sidewalk, smack a iPhone out of someone's hand, get a toddler in a triangle choke;  space and time is so 'infinite' you've done every combination ever in the history of ever. There's just no way to record it because you would still wouldn't be able to comprehend it. 

Look, I got to get going, I'm writing on this on a piece of toilet paper and I hear some guy banging on the bathroom stall. Remember this little piece of wonder philosophy on a piece of toilet paper.. 


... Don't whip your ass with it. I have answers to the Universe on it

<TEXT> Earl and Martha swayed, dancing on top a cruise ship celebrating their 50th anniversary.

From behind, people shrieking in terror, plunging inside ice water below.   

One step after another, like last year. Held together tightly smiling. 

They stared into each other eyes, hands clasped, grooving. 

Miraculous wonderful evening: Night sky, stars, moon shining bright; moving with an ambience of screams. 

*Nothing could take this moment away.*

<TEXT> Hank walked along the sidewalk, his cane in his right hand, moving along as the wind stirred the dead leaves. The sun was setting in the small neighborhood Hank did his evening walks. It was nice, the sun left a beautiful yellow glow on the surrounding houses, small mounds of leaves were piled along the sidewalks. He smiled as he walked, the street empty, it was quiet. 

Until. He heard something. 

A giggle. 

Hank was an old man, but his hearing was still sharp. He paused, standing on the sidewalk. leaning on his cane as he stood there listening. Hank looked around, checking house to house, wondering where the giggle might have came from. There was no other chatter, or people about. He took off his hat, scratching his head, moving grey hairs to the front of his forehead. Then put his hat back on, and continued forward. 

He moved forward a couple steps until he heard it again. The giggle. Louder this time, coming from up ahead, from. Hank squinted his eyes trying to stare off in the distance. 

There again, but on his left. 

Hank turned his body to one of the leaf piles on the lawn of a giant white house. He had been empty for years. Hank passed it often on his walks, never even giving a thought to if a family would one day move in, someone he could call neighbor, but, as always, always passed the house, because to Hank, it was just an empty house. 

Hank looked at the leaf pile he was sure the giggle came from. He looked around again at the empty neighborhood, hearing the soft roar from a near by freeway in the distance. 

He walked toward the leaf pile, it was larger than the others. three feet tall, a couple feet wi--

*Come here.*

Hank paused. It was a voice this time, a child's voice. He squinted at the leaf pile, trying to see past the muddy colored leafs. Hank didn't see children often, and when he did they were much too big to make the sound he heard from the leaves. 

Hank stepped forward, approaching the leafs. He took his cane out, and poked the leaf pile. 

Nothing. 

He set his cane down as his side, taking off his hat again, trying to see even though the sun's light now dieing, making it harder to make out the leaf pile, though he was only feet away. 

*"Come here."*

Hank leaped back, falling on to the dead grass. This was a voice, the same child's voice. Hank winced in pain as he brought his top half of his body forward, looking at the leaf pile. He grabbed his cane, raising it over his head.

"I don't like games!" Hank said, trying to sound forceful. "You kids better not be playing games with me!"

Hank heard the giggle again, this time from behind him, he turned quickly, then jerking his head back to the leaf pile, where he froze. The leaf pile was, yes, it was closer. It had moved, all of it moved, closer to Hank. 

Hank tried to stand but fell back to the ground, grabbing at his knee. He looked at the leaf pile, and then he heard it, again. 

*"Come here."*

It was angier, deeper this time. Hank tried to use his hands to back away, then, the saw it. The leaf pile moved!

All the leafs, moving, the entire pile moving along the grass by itself edged closer to Hank. 

Hank turned his body, now crawling. "Leave me alone!" He yelled, Help! Help!

*We're hungry.* The pile said as it moved closer, Hank turned over on his back. screaming once again. 

Help! Someone! Help! Hank screamed, watching in horror as the leafs began to cover his feet. He couldnt move, he tried to screaming again, begging, he felt himself being dragged into the leaf pile. 

HELP! SOMEONE! PLE-- Hank screams cut off immediately, as the leaves consumed his old body, his hands wiggled out of the leaf pile before disappearing inside.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I stood watching, waiting. The time had come. I only get one shot at this. I watched in the distance and waited. Watching the hundreds of people stand and applaud. I had to wait until they shook hands. 

The cameras flashed and the people applauded louder as Barack Obama and Kim Jung Un started at each other, hands stretched as they walked smiling. Until. 

I clicked my fingers. 

Both Obama and Kim wince in a powerful pain, both moaning loudly, they began to tense and dry hump the air, then collapsing into each other. They moaned from the ground as people and guards rushed to their side. 

I clicked my fingers again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> my hand out, trying to reach

my mistake, and away I float

this is the lesson I know they teach

how not to lose your space boat







Inching further, nothing I can do

can hear voices from inside

*"Don't worry, we'll come rescue you."*

the truth is painful, hard to hide



a few more feet now, I turn and face she

big blue wonder, just a floating there

inch closer, home is where I want to be

lost in the wonder, i can't help but stare



lost in the light, the sun, the stars, can't help, nothing to do

I'll just float, on and away, and try my best, to enjoy the view.

<TEXT> He layed there dieing. Not that I care much. But it was interesting to watch. 

I stood there in the dirt, the sun's heat punishing us still. When we woke up this morning we wanted to move towards water, I saw that he was weak, but, I was too. The thought of being alone? It didn't occur to me until several days ago until he started coughing, weezing. I knew his time would come, but I didn't think so soon. 

He layed as he exhaled deeply, curled up like a baby, moving dust into the air above him with his breath. It was a sad sight, but more so this man I have been traveling with so long didn't know he was the last, and I was the first. 

We never did talk much, but when the planet succumbed to the human race and their contant drilling, she longer brought us rain, but a dreadful heat, a heat women and children couldn't bare. Hiding in caves might as well be like hiding a turkey in a 350 degree oven. The heat drove people out of their homes. So we all traveled, finding shade when we could, but soon more died, and more. So much so there we're times bodies would begin at your feet and end at the horizon. So much death. 

But, death doesn't concern me. This alone thing will. I'm sure death will visit me eventually, I came to this planet without knowing what I was, no memory of what was before me. Just me, and a lot of animals, Earth was still beautiful, green, she had life. Not now, she's bare, dry, unforgiving. 

I watched Man grow, and I watched them fall, but through it all, I always had good company. For a long time I had good company. Now my only company I have left is now exhaling his last breaths. He was a nice man, he did like to talk. I wish he saved his energy he used on telling me about his sexual conquest, or his two daughters he still thought about, he would probably give him a couple more minutes. Just a couple more minutes of life as he died staring into the blue sky with his dry, empty eyes.

 But he will become the dirt, and I will stay, and be alone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "You think after this, after all that has happened, you expect me to trust you!" David said as he tried to keep his balance in the boat. Marshall stood across from him, his hands raised. He was calm. Calm for a man with a gun in his face. Marshall smiled, trying to ensure that he was safe. There was no need to panic, yet. 

"David, you need to let me explain." Marshall said as he too was trying to keep himself balanced in the boat. The dense fog surrounding the two men began to grow thicker. The shore could not be seen anymore. David could see this, and he panicked a bit more. Marshall took a step forward and David reacted. 

"No! You fucking stay right there!" David yelled looking down at the water, trying to see what had rocked the boat minutes ago. 

"David, please, put the gun down."

"No! I trusted you! You told me that it didn't need to eat! You told me it died!"

Marshal shrugged his shoulders. 

"Technically it did die," he said "it just I didn't think offspring could ever be a possibility."

The boat rocked again, throwing David to the floor. Immediately noticed the situation Marshall jumped on David, Trying for the gun. 

"No!" David screamed has Marshall big Bear like hands grabbed the gun and pulled it from Davids sweaty Palms. Marshall stood with the gun now, pointing it at David. 

"Up, and over." Marshall said to David, whom had both his hands raised. 

"Please don't feed me to her, please." Begged David as he pleaded to Marshall to keep his life. "You know I have a family. You know them! You were just over last weekend for beers!" 

"Yes. That's true. Now over, David, over. She's hungry."

The boat rocked again, this time throwing Marshall to the floor, but he landed on his rear, the gun still pointing at David. Then, they both heard it, The sound. 

It was loud, so loud, the creature's noise began to vibrate the boat. A huge splash could be heard from behind David, who quickly turned to see a glimpse of the creature. David knew that it's hunger was a terrible sort. David turned back towards Marshal trying to plead one last time. 

"Marshall, ple--"

"David if you waste anymore time I will just shoot you. In the water, now."

David now crying stood up, staring at Marshall, his eye's in anguish. 

"Everything we've been through, everything! This is how you repay me?"

"Yes, this is how I repay you. To keep what we both created, alive. In. Now." 

David slipped into the water. It was ice cold and David's body responded violently, shivering so much so keeping himself a float was a struggle. He could not scream as his head began to fight for air as it went under and above the water. 

Marshall got back onto the drivers seat, turned on the boat, and directed it back towards the shore, leaving his friend there in the cold water. 

David scanned the water around him again as he floated there in silence, and then he heard it again. He heard the screech from the creature. The water vibrated around him. David turned his head to see where the sound was coming from. Then as he turned his head back there in front of him was the creature, moving so quickly, David didn't get a chance to scream. 

David tried to make a noise, but as soon as he opened his mouth it was filled with water as the creature had his leg, and took him under. Under where David could make no sound. Only to exhale in terror and watch the light disappear as the creature dragged him down into cold darkness.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Who do we have here?" 

"Male, 30's, a wife and two kids."

I stare at a man tied to a chair. He's covered in cords we had attached to him from a computer a few feet from him. He sweats from the heat from the room. The temperature keeps them awake. We need them awake to make sure we can harness all the energy we can get. Pain is pure. But causing pure pain is a struggle. We've been through several trials. Hammering nails into toes. Cutting off limps slowly while they stay awake watching. Whipping them with barbed wire. What we did learn is physical pain, it's temporary. The body heals and we continue the process again. It wasn't until recently we found how pure emotional pain is. It's last longer and takes longer to heal. Today is Tuesday. Today we run emotional pain test number one. 

"How long has he been here?" I ask staring at the man in the chair again, he's eyes plead to let him go but his mouth is covered, so all he can do is struggle to make noise. 

"10 hours, we had to wait for you." Payton says, clicking on his laptop. 

"Well, you know the lines at Starbucks, I was almost there all morning. Are we ready?" I ask making my way to the other side of the room, there a giant box covered with black blanket sat. 

"We're ready." Payton says walking over to the man, taking off the tape from his mouth. 

"Please what do you want? Money? I have money." the man says. 

"Hey, look, you're going to do us a favor and watch. Can you do that?" I ask with my hand on the blanket covering the box. 

"Watch what?" the man asks.

"Your family burn." I take the blanket off. I reveal a metal box with windows of glass on all sides made specifically to withstand high temperatures. Inside the man's wife, and his two kids huddled together looking around. They start screaming. 

"Let them go! Please!" The man yells, struggling to remove himself from the chair. 

"Will do, just watch." I say as I go to the other side of the box, turning on the furnace. "Payton it's 250 degrees, is that good?" 

"Yeah, let's let him watch." Payton says typing into his computer. "We're getting pure spikes." 

The man continues to plead as his family huddles closer together screaming from the heat. 

"Please! Let them go! Please!" The man begs. 

"Oh these are pure spikes. " Payton says as he heads to the door. "You coming?" 

"One sec." I say as I kneel in front of the man. His eyes red matching the color of his face. 

"Do me a favor, just watch, see that camera up there?" I point at a camera on the ceiling facing the man. "If we see you close your eyes once, I'll come in here and cut off your eyelids, you go it?" I get up and make my way to the door. 

"Please! Sarah baby I'm so sorry! Please let them go! Please!" The man yells, watching his family scream from inside the box. 

"That's the spirit!" I say approaching Payton at the door. "How are the readings?" 

"We could power this factory alone on this guy, who knows how much we could sell the Chinese if we could kidnap a couple more family's."

"Good,good, enjoy the show!" I say to the man who continues to scream and struggle in the chair, slowly closing the door behind me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> General Yahoo rode upon his yellow horse watching his line of men. Their eyes were tired, but he would not let them surrender. Not on this day.

His men gather beneath a cool blue sky. The grass they stood upon a pale green but stained in red from the battles from days before. They were the last. Yahoo continued to ride along the line of a few hundred men. He stopped squinting his eyes as he looked into the distance. There what looked like small specs on the horizon other army's made their way to the battlefield. He turned his horse towards his men. 

"Men, This is the day! This is the day the sun has come up! This is the day you rise like the sun! Men. This is the day!"

Yahoo began to ride along side in front of his men looking at each and every one of them. He pointed his sword to one of the men. 

"Who do you fight for?"

"I fight for you, General Yahoo."

Yahoo turned the direction of his horse barreling down to the other side of the men, stopping pointing his sword again. 

"Who do you fight for?"

"You, General Yahoo."

Yahoo turned his horse back around heading back to the center, he boomed. 

"Men, You not only fight for Yahoo, You are Yahoo! We face a great enemy. Google and his men! Hotmail and his. And From the south that people always forget exist, Outlook and his men make their way to this field. Men! Who are you!"

"Yahoo!"

Yahoo asked again. 

"Men, who are you!"

"Yahoo!" they repeated. 

Yahoo turned his horse facing the direction of the incoming armies that grew in size as thousands and thousands became clear in the horizon. 

"Men on this day, We are all Yahoo! We stand together one by one but never forget that together forever we will always be Yahoo!  Men, Who are you!"

"Yahoo!"

"Louder men, Who are you!"

"Yahoo!"

Yahoo turned his horse forward towards the horizon. 

"I will lead the charge. But who you are will ring loudly you hear! Who are you!"

"Yahoo!"

The ground began to rumble as thousands that made their way from the horizon began to run in the direction of Yahoo and his men. Yahoo looked up at the sun, knowing this wouldn't be the last time he would see it at its highest point in the sky. He looked forward at the thousands that came rushing, their screaming voices slowly growing louder and louder. He began forward.

"Men, Consider this field the invitation for their death! Let us help decorate this field in gallons of their blood! Again, men Who are you!" 

"Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo!"

<TEXT> Finnegan and Carbone sit across from each other occupying a booth in a small bar in the middle of town. Few people sitting around, talking. Noises surround them but they paid no attention. Carbone plays with the drink in front of him, using his fingers to outline the top of the glass. Finnegan is making eyes at bartender. He turns his attention to Carbone. 

"How'd you start?"

"Start? Start what? My car?"

Finnegan laughs. "No, this. Us. What we do"

"Oh, this. Money. It's always Money. You?"

Finnegan begins to look around the bar then comes in closer to Carbone, keeping his drink in his hands.

"Passion." 

"Passion? Like how them black boys pursue basketball? Passion?"

"Yea. Like how those black boys pursue basketball. So you do it for just money right?"

Carbone leans back looking up at the ceiling, thinking about his answer. He looks back at Finnegan.

"Yeah, money. I like cars. I like the fast cars. And those fast cars cost lots and lots of money. And well, I'm good at what I do. So yeah. If you really want to know. Money."

"See? There's no passion."

"Passion,the fuck does that mean?" Carbone booms loudly.  "I do it passion."

"No, calm down. Calm down you idiot. Try to see what I'm saying before you get all hormonal. See. Your passion is fast cars. So money comes as a consequence to feed your passion. But you do what you do, and you do it well. But it's not a passion."

Carbone takes another sip of his drink, squinting his eyes as he thinks. He sets the glass down in front of him.

"Fine. You're right. Cars are my passion. So, how does passion come into doing what we." Carbone pauses leaning in closer to Finnegan, he whispers. "Doing what we do."

"It's an art. See, I can tell you something about yourself you probably don't think a lot of people know."

"Tell me what?"

"How exactly you started, See, you just wanted money. So I bet it was really sloppy at first. You tried to get whatever you could. Let any bozo hire you just to get a couple bucks right?"

"First, them bozos paid for the food I needed at the time, and help keep that studio I used to inhabit."

"Okay, But, you we're sloppy right? You made a couple mistakes in the beginning, you probably fucked up. Forgot to clean something or left a gun behind, something like that right? Something big enough that that's all your brain could focus on was that fuck up for weeks. After that you had to wait another couple weeks to find the courage to find another job, right?"

"I won't say."

Finnegan grows a smug smile on his face. His eyes staying focused on Carbone.

"But you're not saying is that I'm wrong." Finnegan continues to smile taking another sip then setting his glass off to the side.

"See, I love art. I've always enjoyed art. I enjoy the time that one has to put into their art. When I was a small boy, like the size of that guy hitting on the bartender. I've always enjoyed the thought of taking life. But what I enjoyed more than the what was the how. I used to think about it even though high school and into college. I thought how I would do it. How I would clean. How I would be creative. How it would send the police into a buzz for weeks as they tried to figure out my methods but, they never could. See, art is time. The more you take your time, the less likely you leave a mess. Less likely you make mistakes, get it?"

Carbone stares at the bartender flattering the man Finnegan mentioned, bringing his eyes back to Brandon. 

"So this. This is art. This is why you take the contracts? Cause the art?"

Finnegan sensing Stephens tone refutes. "Have you been caught?" Finnegan begins to usher the bartender for another drink. He turns back to Stephen, waiting on a answer. 

"No. I'm better now."

"Do you think you could be better?"

"What's your fucking point?"

"Do you think you could be better? Answer the question."

Carbone brings himself closer.

"No, I think I'm pretty fucking good."

Finnegan relaxes leaning back on the chair, leaning out of the way as the bartender setting a drink in front of him, he smiles watching her leave.

"You're going to get caught, see , this is what I've learned, and you might want to listen to this, these words."

"Shoot."

"A good artist is never satisfied. They always believe they can do better and better. And for you, you keep that pattern you got going for you, I'm telling you, how you started, it made waves. And it's going to find you in the present. So if you keep trying to do this for the money, These waves are going to drown you and well."

Finnegan smiles as brings the tip of the glass to his lips, he continues.

"You're either going to find yourself behind those big metal bars with a nice, big, black friend with even bigger friend in his pants, and, well, you might find yourself" Finnegan smugly smiles again as he finishes the drink setting it down in front of him, continuing.

"Let's just hope if, well not if, when. See if you don't try, try harder to find passion in this, what we do. One day those people with those shiny badges are going to show up on that nice house of yours and take every thing away from you, but in return they will give you time. Lots and lots of time in small space with a boyfriend thinking about those little waves that finally caught up to you."

<TEXT> "We must keep moving!"

"We can't! Our people are tired! Please! We must stop and rest! Just for a little while!" Yelled the elder as he hunched with hundreds hurdled in the snow.

"No! Look! The eye is closing, we must stay in the eye!"  

I pointed in the distance past the snow capped mountains, dark grey clouds loomed closer and closer bringing cold wind and rain. I stared at the elder, his eyes red with tears. We had to keep moving. 

"My people! We must be always moving! We must stay in the sun!  I know it's been a long time. You are tired. You must trust me! I know the caves are close! It is our death we are trying to outrun.You must not let it catch you now!"

The elder burrowed his eyes in his hands. 

"I cannot go any further."

I walked to the elder kneeling down beside him.

"Then stay. Stay here. Meet the Gods, but give me a chance to bring our people to life."

He began to cry heavily. I brought myself up and boomed. 

"My people! We must move! Now! The caves are close, I can feel it!"

Hundreds gathered themselves up and begin to move forward, I rushed ahead. I know the caves are close. We must keep going. We will find the caves. 

I looked up at the sun, it glared down brightly on us but brought us little warmth. I walked faster and faster as we began to make our accent up the last towering hill.

"My people! The caves are near! We must not lose hope! Over this last hill we will find the caves! I'm sure of it!"

I could hear them all behind me. Breathing heavy. They were tired. I began to run up the hill. I had the energy. I had the hope. I began to run. Cold wind burned my face as I began to increase my pace with excite. I saw the summit. We were close. We were so close. This would buy us time, I turned back towards my people.

"We are almost there! Please do not lose hope!"

I began to run faster. The summit only feet away. Finally victory. All these months we've have moved. All these months with little rest. Little food. We've lost hundreds. I would not let mother nature beat us. I would not let her beat me. I gave my last energy to eat up the last couple feet remaining of the hill. 

We had finally made it. I have done it. 

I came to the summit and stared. 

And stared. 

And stared. 
 
And stared. 

I felt them behind me. Their footsteps fell silent as they stop and waited. I heard their eager ears clammering for the good news. 

"What do you see! Do you see the caves?"

They asked with excitement. 

"No."

They began to mutter among themselves as I turned and bowed my head. 

"What do you see? What is it?" 

I looked down at them. All their eyes bright with hope looked up at me. I spoke. 

"The coast."

<TEXT> Regardless what anyone thinks. Nobody knows. There's no proof at all. Nobody has died and come back with all the information for answer this question ever in the history of ever. And that's how I think about death. I just do not know. Sure I'll have fantasies thinking maybe this is all a simulation and I'll wake up in a pod with a bunch of other aliens talking shit about how I lived this life, or I'll just die one day and wake up and go "Holy shit I'm a fucking tiger!" I think death or trying to understanding what happens after you pass is the same kind of thing when you try and comprehend the universe. How there's billions and billions of stars and those billions of stars make up a galaxy, and how this one galaxy is just one of the billions and if not trillions of galaxy's that all just float around in what we believe is an ever expanding infinite space. It's just so, so overwhelming. I will always be okay with I don't know. All I know that I have a wonderful life to live and I need to focus all my energy to making sure this life kicks all kinds of ass.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aight. Check it. So I'm just slithering minding my own business. Beautiful sunny day. God just created the earth. I'm having a fucking blast. Then bam. Two naked humanoids are just talking with each other under this big fucking tree right? So. I'm like. Okay. God just made the earth. I got nothing to do. Let's have a little fun. I notice the red apple growing on this tree, I look around and I spot a grass hopper. So I yell to the grasshopper. 

"Yo grasshopper! How much you wanna bet I can get the naked broad to eat that delicious red apple? "

Then the grasshopper yells back. 

"Nah man, ain't no way you gonna get that broad to eat that apple, God instructed them twos to not eat it yo."

This grasshopper think I'm fucking playing. So I'm like. 

"Yo grasshopper, You fucking watch this!"

Aint no way I'm going to let an opportunity slip away like this. Earth is new. Might as well be the first to break the rules right? 

So I make my way up the tree, almost falling out of the fucking thing cause the broads cans got my eyes stuck on them like bees on honey. Anyways, I make my way up and settle right next to the fruit, I got to he really sneaky about this, so I whisper.

"Hey, Broad with the nice cans, psst!! "

She sees me, and comes closer to the hanging fruit. 

"Hey, you, eat this fucking apple." I says. 

She pauses and she's all like. 

"No, I can't, God told me not to eat anything from this tree."

So I'm like fuck. How the hell am I going to get this broad to bend. And obviously not forward but in a way she stick this fucking apple in her beautiful fucking mouth. So I thought of somethings. I'm all like. 

"Don't worry about it, he's not fucking here. Why the fuck would that giant bearded man just leave this beautiful tree next to a beautiful gal like yourself."

Now she's all blushing and shit, smiling and playing with her hair. I know I can get her to eat this fucking apple. But then here comes the other humanoid. He's come up like. 

"Hey, we're not supposed to eat that fruit eve, you shouldn't listen to that snake."

And I'm all like. 

"Why don't you and that tiny dick back the fuck up and go fuck yourself. This conversation is between me and this pretty little angel here, not you and your nosey face."

And he's all like. 

"Okay, I'm sorry.. "

So then I wrap myself around the apple and I lets it drop right? The broad catches it her hand and now she's got this big beautiful fucking smile on her face. I look at homie who looks like he's going to cry and then I look back and the broad is just about to take a big fucking bite. Oh she's going to enjoy the fuck out of it and then Bam! Guess who shows the fuck up? God! He starts huffing and puffing telling them there be consequences for their actions, some bullshit like that, then he turns his attention towards me and blah blah nagging bullshit. Then out of fucking nowhere I hear that fucking grasshopper yell. 

"Ha! I told yous you couldn't get them to eat that fruit! I told yous!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> "You're a murderer?"

"Yes."

"I don't believe you."

"Why?"

Sara paused, her mouth slowly dropped in disbelief from the words David spoke.

"Um, because you just don't tell people that you're a murderer."

"I wanted you to know, I really like where this is going."

"Well, now this is going nowhere because now I don't even know who you are, is your name really David?"

"No."

Sara eyes got wide. "You're name. Is not fucking David?"

"Okay, well, maybe I should have added some context before I would lay something that heavy on you. My name isn't David. It's Dave."

Sara paused and leaned forward, her eyes spoke loud but she decided to use her words. 

"David, Dave is the same exact fucking thing."

"Actually, no, it's one less syllable."

"David and Dave are the same thing!" Sara voice boomed in the crowed restaurant. 

"Look!" David shouted, throwing the napkin that rested on his lap on the table in front of him. "I was trying to be honest! It's people like you that make the world impossible to live in!"

"Oh really, Jeffery Dahmer, please continue! Tell me it's impossible when you're so willing to admit you're a murderer. You know what." Sara pushed her chair out from underneath her and slammed a bundle of bills on the table. 

"This is for my half, please, don't follow me or I'll call the police." Sara stormed out of the restaurant, all eyes gazed on Dave as he sat by himself. 

"Fine! I didn't even want to kill you anyways! Waiter, can I have a pepsi please?

the waiter came forward slowly, leaned down and whispered. 

"Is coke okay?" </TEXT>

It was the 5th time he asked me. I didn't know. I paced in my apartment with my hands behind my back. It was a delicate matter. I had to be careful. 

"We can call the news?" I asked my friend Jeff. Jeff took a bite of his pizza and put it back in the box below him. 

"No, we can't do that. They'll try to twist and manipulate the story to make you sound like a evil warlock or something. And we're white, why would they care?"

Damn. He was right. We couldn't trust the news let alone get their attention. We had to think. I paced back and forth. Back. and forth. 

"YouTube video?" I suggested. 

"No. Wouldn't work. Dude. It's magic. People are just going to think you're using Sony Vegas or Final Cut pro." Jeff picked up another piece of pizza, taking another bite, chewing with his mouth open. "Dude we live in a different time. We need to find that smart black dude, what's his name? Neil Mike Tyson mows grassy or somethin?" 

"Neil Degrasse Tyson."

"Yes him! If we find him. We can prove that we found magic spells. And we know how they work. "

I thought for a moment. He was high profile. He was smart. Jeff was on to something. 

"We have to be careful man." I said. "I don't want to be the reason the world ends because Neil Degrasse Tyson becomes an evil spell casting mage."

Jeff took another bite of his pizza and stood up from the couch coming over to me with pizza still in his teeth. 

"Well Stephen, there's only one way to find out. "  </TEXT>

"NOOOOOOO!" the thing under her bed boomed shaking the bed violently. Penny fell to the floor. I fell back toward the door. I saw penny grasping at her leg. "Daddy! Daddy! Help!" He has her. 

"What are you!" I screamed. I grabbed Penny and I pulled. I pulled hard. It was so strong. So strong. I saw its black skelton hand with long fingers wrapped around her leg tightly. 

"Daddy! Daddy! it hurts!"

"Sweetie baby please hold on."

I almost lost my grip. It was so strong. I pulled and pulled. My feet slipping. I pulled and pulled.

I lost my grip of Penny. I saw her hit the floor and vanished under the bed. 

"No!" I went to the bed and lifted it up with everything I had. I flipped the bed over. He was gone. They where gone. I fell to my knees and bent over to the floor. 

"Penny, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. "

"Okay, Stephen. You do understand where you are?"

"Yes, Yes I do. "

"Okay, so you know, and understand we know everything, ever, in the history of ever, correct?" 

"Yes, I do."

"Okay, so we're going over your behaviors you exhibited in video games, and you are denying, that you've never harmed a single thing in a video game. Ever. "

Saint Peter and looked down to Stephen. Stephen looked around confused, shrugging his shoulders. 

"Not a single soul."

Saint Peter huffed . He clicked underneath his pottium and descending from above a large screen made it's way besides Saint Peter. Another button clicked and a video started playing. Saint Peter continued. 

"So you don't remember hitting this man of color with a baseball bat for 7 straight minutes?" asked Saint Peter pointing to a screen that showed a man being another with a baseball bat. 

"No, I don't recall." said Stephen. 

Saint Peter growled. "You don't remember this, where you got into a motor vehicle engaging in a pursuit with local law enforcement after you mowed down who knows how many people! You don't recall?" 

"Nope."

"What about this, here's another clip where you're just watching a video of one of the characters removing articles of their clothing to reveal large amounts of their skin. Do you remember?"

"No. I don't recall."

Saint Peter looked in awe. He hung his head and brought it back up, his eyes gazing at Stephen. 

"Stephen, we have everything recorded. I don't even want to go into the details of what you did with dogs. Or your family. Look Stephen, you're going to hell regardless."

Saint Peter clicked a button, a opening opened up beneath Stephen, dropping him from the cloud he stood upon. Saint Peter jotted onto a notebook, putting his pen down he reach over for a Xbox controller. 

"Ah, time to relax and play some Grand Theft Auto. "

<TEXT> Angela,

You know that I have a way with words and when I need to say something, I say it. This is just one of these times where my voice wouldn't be able to articulate the things I want to say, so I'll leave it here for words for you to read. This isn't the end, but the beginning. Shakespear once said "Nothing is good or bad, but thinking makes it so." I don't know how you're going to feel, but I hope you keep in mind that right now, this moment I'm happy. You have brought so much color to my life, I don't want you to blame yourself for anything I do. I just cannot even put you, who you are, who you come to be, into words. I would be sitting here writing this all day. I'm happy we shared moments. I'm happy for the life we lived and how we grew together.

Forever is a hard concept to grasp or imagine. For me I'm ready to see what forever it feels like, like our love it is never ending. And like our love it never will. 

I love you, from here to the moon.

<TEXT> "Hi. I'll be your guide on your trip. Have we secured payment?" A man asked with a stretched smile. 

"Yes, I paid. "

The man continued to smile, looked down and up at me again. 

"Alrighty, this way." The man walked away, I slowly followed. I had to stay focused. I needed my mind to be relaxed if this was going to work. 

"Where you from stranger? " the man asked. 

"Colony North of here, in the mountains, I heard of this place though a passing salesman." 

"How nice of that man to educate you of our utopia. " The man stop and faced me." How the air? "

"Bad." It was an understatement. I used the last of the clean air I had to make the trip here. To use the machine. Just one last time. 

The man gestured me to follow. We walked down an endless hallway passing door after door. 

"You've been here before, yes? "

"That's correct." 

"Do you know what memory you'll be visiting?"

"The same. It's always the same."

"Ah. " The man stopped in front of a door. 
"You paid for 30 minutes. In turn the machine will give you 30 hours of time with your chosen memory. You may feel free to manipulate the world, it is your head. Feel free to repeat the memory as often as you like. Remember to give full concentration to the memory so the machine can find it. If you let your mind wonder you run the risk of being dropped off in the wrong memory, and theres no refund as you understand. We will again give you a sign, a blue sunset, when you are on your last cycle. Thank you for your business, and enjoy."

The man walked away and down the hall. I entered the room and sat into the machine. I put the helmet on and relaxed. I had to keep my head clear. I felt the machine kick on. I felt the mask slightly tighten. I thought about the memory. I had to make it vivid. Think about her. I thought about her body. Her name. Her smell. Her everything. I thought about the day at the beach. I thought about that whole day. I thought. I had to think clear. I saw the beach. I felt the sun. I felt the ocean. I felt her hand. I saw the pier. I saw her crying. Oh no. 

The machine kicked on. Oh no. That's not the right memory. I struggled against the machine. I felt myself beginning to slip. It was the wrong memory. Wrong one.

I woke up on my feet. I looked up and around a room. I was standing before her, her bags in her hands. She was crying. She spoke. "I'm leaving you." 

Wrong memory.  </TEXT>

I stared. I held my door open looking at a familiar face.

"Is this real. " I said as I stared.  "You're Natalie Portman." 

She smiled and laughed. "Yes. Yes Stephen. I'm Natalie Portman." 

There was a small silence. She continued to stare at me. I found it hard to make words which I was guessing my eyes were eating all my energy from the sheer amount of beautiful they were injesting. I broke the silence. 

"What are you doing here? " I asked 

"You Stephen. I want you." she spoke soft. 

My eyes lids hit the roof. Me? Why me. I didn't understand. 

"Why do you want me, we've never met."

"I know, but, I've seen a couple of YouTube videos, I went to your instagram and saw the adorable cat pictures you have and I just fell in love."

"Stephen, whats taking so long?" A voice rung out from behind me. Shit. Jennifer is calling. I noticed Natalie heard the voice, she started to walk slowly towards me, she spoke. 

"She doesn't have to know about us. Stephen. Please. I want you. Stephen. Please. "

I put my hands on her shoulders, and exhaled. "Natalie, I'm sorry, but, for you to do that research on me, and show up at my doorstep, you're a fucking psycho." 

"What. "

"How the fuck did you find my address? Look, you're a crazy bitch I understand, but please, please, please, don't ever come back. I'm so freaked out right now, the billboard bitch is confessing her love for me, this is insane! Please Natalie, please go please if you don't leave I'm going to hit you. " 


I shut the door slowly. The door shut and I exhaled deeply. I just could not believed that happened, I turned and shouted at Jennifer. 

"You'd never guess who was just here at the door."

<TEXT>  300 years ago I was human. My heart would beat. I would bleed if you cut me. I thought about death. I often contemplated many hours the day it would visit, and what it would be like to slip from this life and move onto the next-- if there was one. 

I remember the night I made the transition from expecting death to having never to worry about it. 

I met a young gypsy woman on my travels through Europe. She had a kiss I wouldn't forget. A kiss that not only passed on the light that now carries my body until the end of time,  but a kiss that ensures I remember every moment of it. 

And now, I sit here today. It's the year 2014. Im 300 years old. I want those to understand that if you do succumb to a young woman on your travels that passes on a curse that I have, please understand you live not only in a time of abundance but in a time where technology can help bring meaning back into your own existence. 

What I mean is during the first half of my 300 years, you can imagine I lived in a time that was simple. You read books when you were bored, you visited family, friends, for conversation, and you did your part. I was a blacksmith. That's it. I eventually ran out of books to read, I had to quit my job at the time due to my lack of aging, and eventually all my family died. I was left alone. And then technology hit the human race like a bomb. 

I watched it grow, and grow, and grow. I remember the first car. I remember the first computer. I remember the first cell phone. Now, it's the year 2014. I remember a time where it took weeks, even months to travel to places that now only takes an hour or two via aircraft. I enjoy life, because I'm finally living it. Life will lose it's meaning, I think it's supposed to. I spend my time now traveling. I sell my art, thanks to the wonders of the internet.  I play against teenagers online with video games; the other day I play Grand Theft Auto and made friends with a man, Jerry was his name. We have a clan. I will continue to watch technology grow, and I will grow with it, because I feel both technology and I need each other. Both of us will be here for a very, very, long time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Okay, so if I can understand you correctly, and forgive me if I talk slow, 
it will help me and the rest of us, humans, understand your request."

General Hamilton paused. He looked up at the waiting the tall black faceless 
figures that stood before him. He then looked behind at the wide eyed blank faces composed of top Nasa scientist, waiting.  

"Yes, human, please explain our request so that everyone here, has a full understanding." said the tall dark figure.

"So, that we're all the same page, you and your group, come from the a planet, some couple thousand light years away. And the reason you come all this way is because ,out of all the signals that earth sends out at any possible second, your, race, pick up a signal from Earth, and if I'm saying this right, you picked up a signal, that was a game of, what we call on here on earth, American football?"

"Yes!" The tall figure replied excitingly. "Please continue!"

General paused again, he looked around room again exhaling softly. 

"And because you picked up this signal, you're entire society became enticed by the idea that is American football, and then since, since your race obviously have the technology we have yet to possess, you, all, traveled here, to earth, thousands of light years from your home planet, not because of our resources, not because you want to study us as a species or a planet, you simply came, all this way, such a far, far, far distance, because you all, want to form a team?"

There was another pause. General Hamilton looked up at the tall dark figure. Is that correct?

Precisely! the tall dark figure exclaimed. We want to form a team and play, I believe you humans call them the Raiders of Oakland?

General Hamilton looked again around the room, blank faces stared back at him, General Hamilton aughed to himself, and responded.

I dont see a problem with that, as a team they have trouble beating other human teams, lets see how the Raiders fair against our extraterrestrial friends. Are you guys free Thursday?

<TEXT> "What do we do with the town sir?" 

"We hold it."

"Sir- "

"I won't repeat myself Sixsmith." 

Sixsmith swallowed deeply. 

"We hold the town!" Sixsmith shouted loudly to the surrounding forces. The rain pounded hard on the men as the night began to introduce itself to the skies. 

"Sixsmith!" Augustine shouted from his horse. "Gather everyone in the town, bring them here." Augustine turned his horse towards his men. 

"Gather everyone! I want them all here, now! " Augustine boomed loudly, wanting the towns people that took refuge in the buildings were aware of his presence.

Going to building to building. Screaming slowly becoming the evening ambiance as the soldiers took the towns people from their homes. 

Men gathered the towns people in the street. They hurdled together in the thick mud, the rain continue to poor as the night continued. 

Augustine came forward, scanning the towns people. 

"They are merely flesh. They go over. " Augustine pointed west. 

Sixsmith stepped forward. "Sir-" 

"I will not repeat myself Sixsmith . They go over." Augustine pointed again west. 

"They will not survive the fall, sir." Sixsmith softly spoke. It grew quiet. Augustine paused, turned his horse and slowly unmounted from it. Augustine walked slowly towards Sixsmith. 

"I'm simply giving them a chance to see if they can fly Sixsmith." Augustine smiled. "If I have to repeat myself again Sixsmith, we will also test to see if you have wings." Augustine patted Sixsmith on the shoulder and turned. "They go over, now!"

Sixsmith swallowed hard, he turned to the men. The towns people began to cry and scream as the soldiers forced them to their feet. Pushing hundreds forward, walking slowly towards the west.

<TEXT> "Jeff."

"Death."

"What did you bring this time?"

Death raised his hands, revealing a bottle in each hand. 

"Jeff, it's your choice,bourbon or whiskey?"

Jeff smiled, laughing. "Death my man, the bourbon! Come in friend!"

Death followed Jeff into the house, Watching Jeff walk slowly into the living room, stepping over a black cat licking his paws on the wooden floor. Jeff approached his red leathered recliner, softly wincing in pain as he descended onto it.

"Death my friend, man, How you been? Been busy?"

"Yes, Jeff, I have."

"I saw you visited Joan Rivers, was that personal?"

Death laughed as he opened the bottle of bourbon, pouring it into the glasses that waited on the table.

"Well, yes. She has evaded me for so long, thought I would get her right after a surgery, I'm sure have my head when I get back to the hell."

The two laughed and sipped the bourgan softly.

"Ah, Now this, this is good bourbon, where did you get this?" Jeff asked as he leaned back into his recliner. 

"Robin Williams."

"You take from everyone you take?" 

"Yes, also, this is a special visit."

Jeff paused looking at Death. Taking another sip of his bourbon he set it back onto the table, the sound from the glass hitting the wood echoed in the living room. 

"We've been seeing each other for a long time death, ever since you took mom."

"Yes Jeff."

"And Dad."

"Yes."

"Why do you visit me?"

Death put his glass down, Leaning forward resting his elbows down on his knees, looking down at the ground. 

"What I do, isn't easy Jeff, I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't love what I do, I'm just doing my part, you understand." he looked back up at Jeff who was nodding his head softly.

"I take people. When I took your parents, I left you alone. I remember you standing there after the crash, crying."

"I was 8, it was a big loss." Jeff leaned forward and pick up his glass again, finishing what was left inside, setting it back down leaning back against the recliner. 

"Yes, but you could see me. I don't know why. You saw me. There's some rules I don't understand myself to what I do, I just follow orders, but I took upon myself to make a friend. To make the best of the worst possible situation."

"Are you going to take me."

"Not today."

Jeff leaned back into his chair resting his hands on his lap. 




"Jeff! Did you want anything from the store?" Jeffs wife voice jolted Jeff out of the recliner, turning himself in the direction of his wife. 

"No sweetie I'm fine."

"Honey, Who are you talking to?"

"Oh, its the darn cat, He's meowing at me so I'm just throwing some words back at him."

Jeffs wife looked around the room, seeing Bubba on the floor, cleaning himself. 

"Okay, I'll be back shortly, I love you." Walking closer to Jeff giving him a peck on the check. 

"Please don't forget. She pointed at Jeff. Your pills at 9 o'clock okay?" she smiled as she reminded Jeff.

"Yes, sweetie."



Jeff heard the door shut, he returned to his recliner sitting down, facing death again. 

"Don't worry." Death spoke softly. "She still has plenty of time left."

"And me." Jeff asked.

There was a silence. Death pick up his glass and took a small sip. 

"Jeff, you know this isn't easy."

"You seemed to be acting different, it's okay.

Jeff looked over at Bubba who was playing with his tail.

 


Is it going to hurt?" Jeff asked.

"No."

"Is it because of." Jeff paused,swallowing hard. "Is it the sickness that gets me?"

"Yes."

"Can you make sure Betty be the first one to know, it can't be at work."

"Yes, I can do that."

Jeff exhaled, grasping the arms of the recliner he looked around the room. Looking back at death,

"Let's do this." Jeff leaned forward, smiling. 

"Let us chat for a bit more , you can continue with your stories about taking great leaders, I can continue my mad rambles about the neighbors,and hey, maybe finally convince you to take Bob who hasn't returned my lawn mower."

Death and Jeff Chuckled. Jeff continued. 

"Make sure when you come next time, you bring that bottle of whiskey you hear?"

Death nodded. Jeff leaned back into his recliner. 

"Okay, now, last time you left off on how you convinced Hitler to shoot himself."

<TEXT> One day, two buildings stood tall

two buildings stood proud and tall, side by side.

two buildings that stood so wonderfully tall, with nowhere to hide

they stood together with pride,with thousands of people inside.



One day two wonderfully tall buildings watched the September sun.

As inside the two buildings was working everyone.

working was everyone inside two buildings that stood so wonderfully tall

not even to entertain the thought that they, someday, might fall.




One day two wonderful buildings were greeted with a boom

greeted with a big boom and a flash

greeted with a big boom and a crash

greeted with a big boom and a smash.

There stood the wonderfully tall buildings,

both sporting fire and smoking gash.



Fire ablaze there stood two buildings with people inside

people inside that tried to hide 

people inside that screamed and cried

people inside that hoped,prayed, and cried not to die. 



One day and one by one

two building stood tall, so wonderfully tall in the september sun

there they stood being watched by everyone

there they stood and one by one, they fall

at the end of the day

no longer will two wonderful buildings stand tall.

<TEXT> "Jim." 

"Yes. "

"Are you listening." 

"Yes. "

" Okay, can you please hand me the good saw. "

"Yes, Master" 


Today is my first day. Brand new. I'm what you say right off the boat in the field of torture. Can't explain why I'm so attracted to it, I guess it started when I was younger, torture was something as I found as a form of beautiful justice. I saw my first live.. 

"Jim, please, the good saw! "

Damn, lost in my mind again, I drift a lot. Okay. The good saw is always so close, why does he need me to get it. I went over to the wall where it rested, previously used, bloody, It's an art. I grabbed the saw and rushed it back to master.

"Here is the good saw Master."

"Thank you, anyways, please pay attention. What is the goal. "

"Information." 

"No, The goal is to force information. Imagine him like a balloon That's it. He's a balloon, filled with hot air, and when they yell and cry, it's all just hot air. Remember. He's a balloon." 

Master pointed over at the next person we would be squeezing justice from. He rested on a chair. Naked. Confused. He panted heavy, his feet were raised exposing his shins as they rested size by side. 

"Jim, are you paying attention. "

" Yes. "

" 
Okay, have you heard of this technique before? "


Yes. I have. I've read this before, this is a tactic torturers have used for years. I love it. I couldn't wait to see it live. Okay, so, People might have a tendency to cry and moan. I'm aware of this. It's awful. Telling us about their families. How they want to live. Blah. Blah. Blah. If we see this human differently, torturing is fun. It's exciting. Master leads me over to the balloon that looked at us wide eyed. He began to shake. 

"Now, Jim, this is just scratching the surface of what are we going to do. This balloon you see in front of you has no information, we're to just show you how to properly extract it if this was a situation that, well, information was needed."


"So, what are we doing?"


"Watch. "

Master puts a black cloth over the balloons head. And rest the saw on his shins. The balloon begins to scream loudly. 

"We're going to do this slowly, I want you to know, answers will always after to come after the pain, not during. You don't stop. You finish the job. You show him his leg. You ask the question. If he refuses. The next leg."

Please can we do this already. Master hands me the saw. I feel the power I adjust myself over the shins, and press gentley. The balloon squirms. I begin sawing. I saw. And saw. I can feel the heat from the blood. Yes. Justice. I keep sawing and look over at master. 

"Yes, hold. Tightly, wait, stop. "


Master comes to me and motions me aside and takes the saw. The balloon is screaming but it has no effect on us. It's just all hot air. 


"You need to make sure you use proper form. You need to motion with your elbow. Push with the elbow. Forward." 
 
There was a scream as Master moved the saw forward into the shin. 

"And hold for one Mississippi, and then back, again, make sure to now pull with the elbow." another scream. Hot air escaped the balloon. Master continued with the pull, push, pull, push, pull, push. Until the balloons legs both laid still with no body attached. 

"You see. " said Master. "You need to make sure you focus on proper form. We don't get the health benefits like we used to so make sure you remember form, so you don't have to retire in your 30's. You understand?" 

"Yes Master. "


"Okay, next, let me show you how we deal with the eyeballs, can you hand me that screwdriver."

<TEXT> I don't know how I do it. I really don't. I'm just on my bed. I close my eyes. I hear the silly hippie music my friends suggested my ears ingest while I do thing called "meditation." I listen. I listen to my breathing. I focus on my breathing. Concentrating on my breathing. Just focus.

It's this focus that propels me out of this 214 pound body, don't ask me where I go. I have no fucking idea. I'm like a 4 year old on a road trip, I don't understand what's around me but the colors are bright and I'm surrounded by geometric shapes I don't recognize but their fun to look at. 

I know when I'm gone. I'm traveling fast, seeing things that were and could be. It's exciting now, obviously. The first couple times, yeah, not so much fun. I'm hurling though infinity, scary the first couple times. It's like a boat. I had to get used to the motions before I could actually enjoy the trip. 

I don't know how to navigate. There no maps, mostly colors. I think the colors are my own thoughts. I'm being vacuumed though what I think is my own reality, again, I don't really know. I'm just trying to enjoy the trip. I can feel my body still, I need to. It's like a rope. A lifeline. 

When I get back. I open my eyes. I don't usually remember much. I think I'm back in my own reality. I think. I'm not sure. There's no way to test. I know I'm on my bed. I know I'm in my room. I can see my text books I take with me to school. I know I'm home. The problem. When I stand up I walk. I walked around my room, I stare in the mirror.  I look on my stomach. Everytime I go on these trips, I notice a  new scar. I have 8 now. I appreciate that I have the opportunity to go on these trips, I just want to know  who's been counting.  </TEXT>

"Hey, David."

"Yes, Ryan?"

"I actually have a question about rent."

"I just paid you."

"Yes, you did, um, can I ask you a question?"

"Yes."

"Have you been looking for a job?"

"Yes, I've been on craigslist all day."

"Yeah, Um, remember how you told me you had a job interview at a bank last week?"

David turns off the TV, setting down the burrito he was eating adjusting himself toward Ryan.

"Yes, I remember."

"Well, I don't know if you watched the news recently, but do you remember how Dr. Fingertoes recently just got away with robbing a bank downtown? Um, wasn't that about the same time you had your job interview?"


David began to sweat, his face becoming pale, he rested his hands on his knees, he looked down on the floor.


"Yes, Actually I did, and how Captain Heelhook almost stop him, but Dr. Fingertoes hit him over the head with a fire hydrant." David looked back up at Ryan, who had just began to remove the bandage from his head. 

"Why the bank."

<TEXT> It's just how I feel right now.  I HATE IT. I didn't think I would feel this way again. I personally feel like love is a word that's tossed around entirely to much.  Everyday I just see people use it as a hello or as a way to say goodbye.'' Ok love ya!'' It bugs me.  The words deserves more than that. I've made the mistake of abusing the term with people I honestly didn't love. Now I try to not to say things I dont mean.  And when it comes to something like this I just want to say it.  I just want to tell random strangers without looking like a weirdo '' IM IN LOVE MR MAILMAN.  IM IN LOVE 7 ELEVEN GUY.'' Is it just me? I know some people find love and it's just amazing seeing two people in love with each other.  7 billion  people on this planet and they managed  to narrow it down and find each other.  Old couples that been together for YEARS have this.  LOVE GROWS.  I used to think it was this singular thing but fuck does it expand like when a sun runs out of carbon and starts burning helium(something may be wrong there.) . It's this emotional soreness.  Ever miss someone that you love? Their absence lingers. It effects you PHYSICALLY. Why THE FUCK. I know this might all sound negative and I really should have used a throw away but I don't care.  I just had this epiphany this morning at breakfast with her.  Oh boy </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last night I decided to take the Boeing 747 at Los Santos Airport for a circle around San Andreas.  Flying this bad boy in first person is amazing.You can move the camera around so you can look off to one side and see that sexy thang called San Andreas or look off to another side and see a vast beautiful ocean. Coming full circle and tempted to crash this mother fucker into a building I thought I try and land it. Unfortunately I started my decent way, way to early and I swore I heard screaming. (Could have been in my head. It would be truely morbid if this airplane was filled with hundreds of San Andreas residents.) The plane crash into the ocean just short of the runway. I will attempt this again because it was truely an interesting 15 minutes and oddly relaxing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was 6 I would eat my dads sweets he had hidden(mostly powerded doughnuts or danishes) I never got caught because I would take them into my sisters bedroom (who was 4 at the time.) and put some of the crumbs in her bed or around her face and leave the wrapper in there. My dad would wake up , find his sweets missing, he would go into my sisters room and see the evidence. I felt pretty bad when he would scold her for lieing,she would promise that she didnt eat them but it was hard to believe her when she had powered sugar on her face and around her bed. I'm 23 now and shes 21 and my dad still thinks that she ate his sweets. (I've openly admitted that I was the one who did it to my sister but when were around family and the topic comes up I deny it.) </TEXT>

I also LOVE this time of the year because the weather is better and I can do longer and longer bike rides. (Recently did a bike ride up Mount Diablo here in the bay.) BUT MY FAVORITE FAVORITE FAVORITE is getting home from a long bike ride, cooking up about 2 pounds of ground beef, throw some pizza sauce on it with cheese and pepperoni, TOKE up eat and relax.(which ussually getting so high I eat until I'm sick and pass out.) I love it :) </TEXT>

I'm currently cutting with keto and I bicycle sometimes for 3-4 hours once or twice a week.(aslo I commute via bike lol)P90x is pretty intense, so don't feel bad if you need to take a break (Seriously, if you feel like you're going to pass out or can't catch your breathe. Stop. Rest. and then continue.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. Try to drop the weight before you continue the program. Being that heavy with the he combination of polymetrics (unless you're doing some kind of strength training) is really really hard on your knees. I'm 6'4 215 and if I wanted to try to dunk again I would need to cut down to 195 or 190 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Explore bud. When I first started out I used to do circles around the block. I would do 3 miles, then 5, then 10. I then forced myself to go out and explore the area on my bike. It may not be the best method but it gets you on your bike and doing something new. Plus you might find something though your exploring that no other person could have told you.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-07-24 03:54:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Recently stumbled upon on lean gains about 5 weeks ago and have been with it for the last 3 weeks, I really love it...NOW the problem is trying to gain weight.I'm 6'4 210 pounds currently,I also commute to work on a bicycle 5 days a week (about 10 miles total a day) As much as eating 4200 calories on workout days is fun and all I cannot afford 4200 calories worth of food on those days (sometimes I can get about 2800-3200) [basic example of my macro's](http://i.imgur.com/SWXLv.jpg) 

I'm just curious on peoples thoughts on weight gainers and if they help or not. Or my other tall brothers what are some of your tips and tricks in getting your calories for workout days. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im really upset with wwe 12...its nothing different then smackdown vs raw 11...I love that they added in a create an arena and brought back old superstars but the game at its core is still nothing different. Create a super star is the same. Create a move set is the same. I can't really tell about the new physics engine because for some reason when i think im about to belly to belly someone over the top rope for some reason there's a invisible wall that keeps them in the ring. The gender restrictions is the most absolutely upsetting thing as well. I don't understand why I can't take out a ladder in a hell in a cell match or extreme rules the weapon are so limited(eventually you can't weapons out of the ring ) they use the same animations for wrestling moves since shut your mouth and the animation of doing a move though the cell is the same as 
its been. Wwe 12 is more of an expansion pack then anything. I can't believe th charging people $60 for the game.( the wwe universe is improved but im mostly upset with gameplay) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should worry less about kills and be a team player. Try playing as the assault class and just focus on reviving people...it's just as awarding as killing someone( 100 points) and can be way more intense. Or support class and focus on shooting at a general direction when you see a dorrito because you get points for suppressed fire </TEXT>

<TITLE> What do you kids want in future Battlefield games? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-10-30 05:43:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know this is a little early but I thought about this a lot. There's talks about Playstation 4 and Xbox 720 and it made me thinking what will a fps look like on those consoles, and how far is this technology going to take FPS games, here's just a short list of things I would like to see in future battlefield games:

-maybe more blood and gore. For me that as real as it can get. Battlefield 3 did great with the blood splatter but I don't feel its enough,so maybe it be possible in the future to see me shoot someone with a tank and they actually explode into several pieces, not just one.

-more player battles for consoles, I can't afford a nice pc to play battlefield 3 on and I'm uber jealous thats battles are taking place right now that have 64 people shooting the fuck out of each other. I would like to see that on future games (if its possible) maybe even bigger battles 100 vs 100 (that would be pretty epic if everyone agreed to knifes only)

-Destruction was amazing in battlefield 3 and I can't wait to think what there going to do with frostbite 3 or even 4.I would like to see more destruction on a bigger scale, multiple story buildings just being blown to shit


I have a ton more but is there things you kids would like to add? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2011-10-26 07:08:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> for me what makes driving in a game is the cockpit view, I think it adds some extra realism and the attention of detail the developers had put into the game. I think it would rather be a nice touch

on the traffic I don't think there was ever enough cars around (unless you were downtown in GTA4) but I like to see that large scale of cars on the roadway, would be interesting to SEE REAL TRAFFIC (so that way if can annoy me in real life and in a video game lol)

<TEXT> you said you want "over the top realism" but you want cheats and pedestrians to have dildos and handguns?

I would FUCKING LOVE if they brought back helicopters and planes,maybe even be able to walk around the airplane because you can set it to auto pilot, like have a A380 and one of the aircrafts you can fly ...customization to cars and trucks.. I like gore too

<TEXT> I would think it would maybe be released in 6-9 months? (like a baby..maybe) because sooner then later seems to make sense since talks of xbox 720 and playstation 4 coming out in a year or two and I don't see why they would release a couple months before a new console comes out (even if the consoles are backwards compatible, I would think that more people would be focused on playing new games for the new consoles) my bet is June 2012 </TEXT>

<TEXT> ive been on keto since July and I love the results. Im 6'4 and at the time I was 265, as of right now I'm at 245 and Im going to disneyland this weekend and I thought I might as well take the week off from keto because the call of carbs are to great, and I thought it be a great time to recover because how often I work out and even if keto is so amazing I need a break from it. I was just wondering if other people taken breaks, how it was while you were off and how easy/hard was it for you to jump back on the keto train? </TEXT>
