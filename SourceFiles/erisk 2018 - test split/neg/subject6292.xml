<TEXT> I wake up.
 
Get up. Get dressed. Bathroom. Brush teeth, hair. Breathe.

*Breathe.*

Watch myself breathe.

*Get moving. You have to.*

Leave the bathroom, wake up the kid. Smile.

Feel warm. Cozy.

Wife is up. Get hug. Better still.

Make breakfast. Quick eggs. Great with cheese.

Shadows creep in.

*Ignore it. Keep moving. Keep going.*

Clean up. Get my stuff. Say goodbye, have a nice day.

Smile. Hug.

The warm is tainted. The cozy has started to tremble.

In the car, drive to my appointment.

Radio on. DJs wont stop talking. Traffic wont keep moving.

The warm is gone. The world shrinks down. 

*Focus. Drive. Get there. You know a better route.*

Take a shortcut. A quarter mile lead, a fifteen minute gain.

Reach the clinic. Try to park.

Nowhere to go but the farthest spot. 

*Fantastic.*

Leave the safety of the car. My car. Impenetrable. 

*Forget that. Keep moving. Keep going.*

Make it inside. Find my place  easy. Walk in, take a number, take a seat.

Called up. Sign in. Take another seat, somewhere else.

Placed. Put next to someone I dont know.

Someone else put on my other side.

The world shrinks. Cant touch the armrests. Cant get close.

*Its happening again. Dear god, why?*

Im looking around, quietly hoping everything will stop. 

The man next to me smiles. Makes a polite comment, a friendly gesture.

Its nails on a chalkboard, feathers on my spine.

The line moves. I get up, shift over. More space, but its too late. 

*Its started.*

Cant focus. Dont know if Im breathing.

Look up. Line moved again. Shift over.

Nurse says something to me. I didnt catch it, couldnt hear her words.

She repeats it, pointing toward the seat I just left.

Didnt hear again. Sheepishly reseat myself.

*Somethings on me!*

Panic! Help!

A hand. A gentle finger on my shoulder, telling me to come along.

Abashed, I comply. Stand, follow, sit.

Time to give blood. I hate needles.

*Dont look. Dont feel.*

*Breathe. Just breathe.*

Its over. Bandaged up. Nurse hands me a cup, says something.

I missed it. My heart is in my ears. I ask for a repeat. Barely caught it the second time.

Stand, walk, search. Where was I supposed to go?

*Where am I?*

*Whats going on?*

Tightly clutch the cup in my hand. I know what Im supposed to do, but where?

I search, wander, cant find my way.

Lost, losing hope. 

*I just need to find the place to fill the cup!*

A nice man notices me. Offers to help.

I hear him, but cant respond. Im frozen. No pride, just hollow desperation.

He almost leaves. I manage to speak, to ask where to go.

He doesnt know. Points me the way I was walking. Probably not right.

*Im an adult. I should have this handled.*

My heart is thrumming, my palms sweat. Tunnel vision creeps in. 

*Where am I? What am I supposed to do?*

Somehow I manage to find my way. I made it.

No relief. 

*Fill the cup.*

Did it.

*Where do I put it?*

Fear. Anxiety. Judgments levied against me, I know it. I should know what Im supposed to do.

*Cant follow simple directions. What is wrong with me?*

As though I dont know.

*There  someone with a badge. Quick, ask for help!*

Got it. Delivered the cup. Now I get to leave.

Consider stopping for food. 

*NO! GET OUT!*

Gotta get out, gotta leave. Get safe.

People arent safe.

*Just get to the door.*

Shit! Someones behind me!

*No harm. Get to the door.*

Nonono, someones walking toward me.

*Go around!*

Help! More behind me!

*Youre okay! Keep moving! Keep going!*

Outside! Almost there!

Breathe

Cross the road, get to the lot and

Oh, no.

Theres a car. Just parked.

Theyre out to get me!

*That doesnt make sense.*

Neither does parking outside of a space.

*The lot is full.*

No, theyre sinister.

*Walk, dammit. Get to your car.*

Shit. The engine is running.

*So what? Get going.*

*Dont stop walking.*

*Dont stop*

Shit, shit, shit...

*Cut left. Get away. Go around.*

Theyre coming.

*No theyre not.*

Theyre after me.

*No theyre not.*

They want to kill me.

*No they dont.*

*Get to the car.*

At the car.

In the car.

Sit. Breathe.

*Breathe.*

Breathe.

Start the car. Go home.

Every car is out to get me. Every driver wants me off the road.

Almost stop for food. Unknown daemons in the drive thru stop me.

Get home. Get food. Lie down.

Breathe.

*Breathe.*

Shit.

My wife stirs from her nap. A gentle kiss, a loving word.

Brief warmth, lost in empty cold. Cozy feelings wrapped in barbed wire and razor blades.

I check the clock. Not even 10 AM.

*shit.*

<TEXT> Okay. So, my process is to break it down by sentence, asking *does this need to be said, to say it?* Does it capture the idea? Is it enough? Or unnecessary?

 Just as Luca was about to turn back, he bumped into a large object. 

Good start, but a little unwieldy. I'd suggest he bumped into *something.* This sets it up for your later descriptions. It will be assumed by the reader that the *something* is large, and confirmed later.

His fingers fumbled over a shelf filled with upright rectangular objects varying in size and texture. 

This is a bit more complicated. The idea is simple - books on a shelf - but you're using four words where one will do. For example: *He groped through the dark, fingers fumbling across a shelf full of odd objects.*

This reinforces his lack of vision, and sets up that he is about to encounter something unfamiliar.

Some were shorter or taller, thicker or slimmer, solid or flimsy, but all were neatly organized into a horizontal row extending about an arms length in each direction.

I'm just going to put in my edit here, and then try to explain it.

*Some seemed leathery, some solid as wood, but they were all different heights and widths, and seemed to be lined up as far as he could reach in either direction.*

I threw some tactile language in here, a little sensory information for the reader to relate to. 

 Multiple shelves extended vertically as well, from above Lucas head down to his feet, each containing its own row of the four-sided items. 

*Reaching first upward, then down, he felt out more shelves, each with more of the objects on them.*

This is the same idea, simplified. The concept is similar to saying "We" instead of "Him, her and me." (Oxford comma optional, lol) Here's where I remember my old English teacher's line of questioning: Who did what, how, and where? What you had was Who did what, where, who did what, where, and how. MUCH more complicated, and just hard to read.

He removed one of the strange rectangles from the shelf and examined it with his hands. The object was about two inches thick and had a stiff outer cover partially enveloping a stack of loose sheets of material that were stuck on one end to the inside spine.

I'm combining these two, because I feel the ideas belong together.

*Curious, Luca slid one of the items from the shelf. It was vaguely box-shaped, but open on three sides, with something rough in between. He cautiously pressed on it, discovering that it was made of numerous fibrous sheets, which gave way, flexing open and pushing the solid front cover with it.*

 Luca riffled through the sheets, producing a rustling noise reminiscent of the sounds he made venturing through the dry leaves of the forest.

I like this. I like it a lot. I'm just going tweak it slightly , and make it fit the rest of what I have.

*He rifled through the sheets, producing a rustling noise which reminded him of shuffling through dry leaves in the forest.*

He thumbed through the object until he reached the back cover, next shaking the item to see if anything would fall out. 

He already thumbed through the book above. Well, rifled. Similar enough that this seems redundant to read. What about:
*At a thought, he grabbed the solid covers, held them open, and shook lightly to see if anything fell from between the sheets.*

When nothing emerged, he dropped the object thinking it might break open, but it harmlessly fell to the floor with a dull thud.

Honestly, I'm not sure what this sentence is about. It feels unnecessary to me. I'm going to run past it for now.

Confused, he picked the item back up and sniffed it. Right away a pleasant musty aroma filled his nose. 

*When nothing was forthcoming, he leaned in and gave the object a quick sniff. It was pleasantly musty, like some sort of precious heirloom.*

Going a little off-book here, but adding more ideas, trying to make it relatable. Also, just learned that Reddit doesn't think relatable is a word.

It was like nothing he had ever smelled before, but somehow it was warm and familiar, triggering an overwhelming nostalgic feeling that coursed through his veins and engulfed his soul.

This bit is huge, runs on, and is easily where I have the most trouble here. As I said before, he doesn't know what this object is; all he has is this tactile information he just acquired. You have an extremely significant response written in, one which doesn't fit the scene you've set. Let me take a stab at it...

*It was strange and unfamiliar, but somehow... comforting. It smelled both like storage, and people, as though it had seen many hands before finding its way into his.*

Although unable to identify what he was touching, Luca was positive it was something special.

*Whatever it was, Luca felt sure it was something special.*

Minor wording changes.

Okay, so, every step of the way, you've either seen my point, or been outraged at my careless chopping at your work. Either way, let's take a look at it all together:

 Just as Luca was about to turn back, he bumped into something. He groped through the dark, fingers fumbling across a shelf full of odd objects. Some seemed leathery, some solid as wood, but they were all different heights and widths, and seemed to be lined up as far as he could reach in either direction. Reaching first upward, then down, he felt out more shelves, each with more of the objects on them. Curious, Luca slid one of the items from the shelf. It was vaguely box-shaped, but open on three sides, with something rough in between. He cautiously pressed on it, discovering that it was made of numerous fibrous sheets, which gave way, flexing open and pushing the solid front cover with it. He rifled through the sheets, producing a rustling noise which reminded him of shuffling through dry leaves in the forest. At a thought, he grabbed the solid covers, held them open, and shook lightly to see if anything fell from between the sheets. When nothing was forthcoming, he leaned in and gave the object a quick sniff. It was pleasantly musty, like some sort of precious heirloom. t was strange and unfamiliar, but somehow... comforting. It smelled both like storage, and people, as though it had seen many hands before finding its way into his. Whatever it was, Luca felt sure it was something special.

...but then, that's just my two cents. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I see where you're going, but what's written seems to clash with the idea I see you aiming for. 

Maybe, strangely comforting, instead of warm and familiar. Similar idea, but seems to fit closer. To me, anyway.

<TEXT> I got bookshelf in the second sentence, confirmed with the third. The rest had nice, relatable imagery, but went on perhaps a bit too long.

Was he in darkness, or blind? Unclear, though he never seemed to use his eyes. Does he not know what a book is? Just curiosity, here. If not, though, then that last bit - warm and familiar, nostalgia - doesn't fit. Books are one of those things. If it gives you those sort of emotions, then there's no way to not recognise them - even blinded. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I beat him on my first attempt, without really knowing what I was doing. Used probably the cheapest method, though.

There's a spot in the cave as you enter the room, just after drawing aggro from him, just inside arrow range, and with a tiny outcrop from the cave wall on either side. I literally spent thirty minutes jumping out, shooting one arrow, and rolling back behind cover before his web spit could hit, over and over and over again. 

Killed him without really even entering the room. Best way to handle spiders. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see you have no feedback after five hours, so I just want to say good for you. 

Anyone who feels the need to dictate your path through life, in my personal opinion, doesn't deserve to be a part of it. If all they seem to do is make you feel like shit, then you're better off.

It sucks, knowing that you've reached a point where you have to write off someone you've known for years. I've done the same with friends and family members I've known all my life, so I can relate to your decision.

It's hard. It sucks. You will miss them. And then, you'll realize that you feel better now than you did back then.

But don't be fooled, it will come back, again and again. To this day, I get wistful about my ex wife of six years almost monthly. But there again, you won't forget. 

It's our past that forms us. Hold on to it, learn from it, and let it guide you on your way.

Oh, and happy new year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know why I did it, exactly. 

Call it a compulsion, an urge that couldn't be ignored. It wasn't the first time, and it certainly wouldn't be the last.

I walked into the bank and approached the teller, palms sweating, nervous, and yet thrilled. My heart pounded in my chest as I leaned across the counter and told her my request.

Her eyes widened, staring at me for a moment as if to ask, "Are you sure you want to do this?"  I stared back, face set in a casual mask, giving nothing away. 

Quietly, she tucked a loose strand of brown hair behind one ear and reached toward her station, going to work. I could tell she was judging me, but I didn't care. This was what I lived for.

I didn't know what I'd do after this. Nothing had been planned beyond getting what I'd come for. 

I started tapping my hand on the counter, getting impatient. I suppose it also showed on my face, as the teller looked up at me, her eyes pleading forgiveness.

After far too long, I hear the printer start up, and my heart thrills again as she reaches under the counter to hand me the cashier's check for $10,000, made out to the local chapter of the ASPCA.

My eyes welled up, thinking back to those Sarah McLachlan commercials I saw on Animal Planet the night before. Normally I was able to move on with my day, but I swear, they played eight of them in one commercial break, and my will broke. I knew what I'd be doing today.

My wife would understand. After all, she spends most of her time there.

I drove over to hand off the check in person, eager and dreading to see the look on her face. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Day 1 pc, I played through one system that only I had seen.



Couldn't play for a few days.



Sunday night, I hit my second system - Discovered by T.C. McQueen.



He only claimed one planet there, so I did some exploring, and moved along the path of Atlas. 



Next system: Discovered by T.C. McQueen.



Same again, next system: Discovered by T.C. McQueen.



And so on, for ten systems. I hate T C. McQueen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since nobody is putting up a real answer here, and I love the idea, here's an idea that might help:

1: Stand at the front of your ship, with the right edge aligned to your screen border.

2: Note where ship cuts off at left screen border. Count 1

3: Move left until previously noted cut off point aligns to right edge of screen.

4: Repeat from step 2 until entire ship is covered.

Should give you a nice visual reference specific to your monitor setup. (I.E. 5 screens long.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed, criticism is productive. Hence my criticising the hypocrisy inherent in your calling out what you perceive as unnecessary with something equally unnecessary. 

Further criticism: Your belief in something doesn't make it right. If you disagree with something *many people* are saying, you are not obligated to respect their opinion. Neither, however, can you expect to get anywhere with open jeers.

My advice to you is as follows: If you can't make everyone on the internet believe as you think they should, cry me a river, build a bridge, and get over it - if possible, into a different community, where they all hate the same things you do. 

You'll be happier there. </TEXT>

I was their guardian and protector, their god...until I saw that they'd built their civilization next to a subterranean Floran village. I knew that they'd become screaming, juicy popcorn once they were found, so I started destroying their houses to spare them that horror. Ended up bringing quite a few of them with me when I left.

I started out wanting to play Terraria, but it just felt too... I dunno, full? A ton to do, with no direction. Quit out of frustrated apathy after a couple hours, then noticed this game in my library from ages ago. Thought, why not? Let's fire it up and see what's new.



Aaaaaand, twelve hours later, I realize I should have gone to sleep yesterday, six hours ago.



Since then, I can't stay away. Pretty much all my free time, I'm exploring, gathering, farming, building, crafting, mining, playing, creating, designing, planning... You get the picture.

And that's just single player.



Much love, chuckle fish. Much love. </TEXT>

<TITLE> To the large group of teenagers who went to see Lights Out at my local theatre tonight... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-30 06:00:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You are solely responsible for the most aggressively irritating and unpleasant moviegoing experience I've ever had. The theater is not your buddy's house, where you can scatter and shout at each other whenever you please. Believe it or not, most people who attend these things tend to be able to stop talking long enough to actually hear and process what's happening on screen - or, at the very least, for ten consecutive seconds. 



Admittedly, there was a ten minute section somewhere in the middle where it actually got quiet enough for me to fall into the plot, and I was just thinking you guys might have calmed down, when I suddenly hear a lot of taking coming from the entryway. You people left in the middle of a horror movie, for ten minutes, as a group, and then came back, still taking more than a filibustering congressman.



Now, I understand that the theatrical horror movie experience involves a certain amount of audience involvement - the jump scares, the dread, the screams and cautionary calls to the person on screen - but you all took it to a new level. It's like there has never been a filter between your brain and mouth. All ten or so of you.



Okay, I don't want to seem unreasonable. I know people talk at the theatre. It's a minor annoyance we all deal with, and I was trying to deal. But you guys couldn't even confine it to one area of the theatre that I could tune out. Half of you say in the top row in the left, and the other half moved to the bottom right section of the theater, fifteen minutes in. I know this, because your whole flock passed right in front of me, and then sat right behind me.



The only saving grace is that I now have an amusing story to tell about the assholes who wouldn't stop trying to one-up each other in a bitter struggle to win the "Biggest Asshole in a Public Setting" contest.



The worst part? You all are black, you're not doing anything to help the negative stereotypes about your people, and now that I've mentioned that, I've already been labeled racist in the minds of most of the people who read this.



But I'm here to rant, not seek approval. 



Anyway. In conclusion, the lot of you suck at being decent in public. May you all live a long and *interesting* life. </TEXT>

2: You have 30seconds to a minute before they'd blink out, and they'll tell you when they've had enough a few times before they go. Just be quick.

3: Interacting with the deed will have it check the area for valid housing. This saves time, if you're worried you left it too long.

In my experience, unless you break a foreground or background wall, they don't seem to care. Beds are nothing. </TEXT>

Probably my toughest and least successful rule is trying to fizzle a turret every level that they appear, and my most successful is taking out every turret in the arena (that big square three storey room near the end with all the hatches in the walls) without taking damage, alerting them, or touching them directly. I'm proud of that one, lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, the ultra rare *reasonable and enlightening internet discussion*. It's not every day you find people willing to patiently explain their way, while also accepting the contrary views from someone else. If I had more money, I'd throw some Gold your way in appreciation.

I never considered the replay value aspect, given that the game has so much already. There again, though, I have occasionally put limitations on myself to artificially raise the difficulty level, because most things seem more fun with that extra level of challenge. Is it something like that?

<TEXT> Well, that's certainly different. I can't imagine you figuring out to do that on your first run, though... Unless you only picked up the game to practice and improve speedrunning it.

I've never understood the draw of speed runs. You're basically heavily diluting the experience of the game for bragging rights, and possibly some sort of compensation in contests. My personal opinion: Games should be enjoyed to their fullest potential, not rushed through homeopathically.

That said, I'm impressed by your video. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reborn, if you just need something shorter.

I don't think an abbreviation exists for that word right now, but let's play around, shall we?

Reincarnated

Reincarn'd

Reinc'd

R'ncarn'd

...not a good word for this, I think. Synonyms would probably serve you better. Something like reborn, revived, hell, even incarnate would work in the right context. For example:

His spirit has been *reincarnated* as a woman.

That woman is his spirit *incarnate*.

<TEXT> Strange as it may sound, breathing.

Take a moment, and slowly fill your lungs up completely. Not til it hurts, but just a bit more than usual. Then let it out, just as slowly. Now, keep doing that while you read the rest of this.

Practicing this deep breathing has a few benefits that I have directly seen. Your heart rate slows down, which can help relieve tension and reduce headaches. By now you should feel a certain amount of calmness that wasn't there before, even though you haven't been doing it very long.

In addition, letting more clean air into your lungs oxygenates your blood more, which can help reduce muscle fatigue, improve mental acuity, and even promote healing. 

At this point, you should already feel a slight increase in your energy levels, but it also works the other way around. Breathing like this can actually help you fall asleep faster. So, it helps when you're active, and also when you're at rest!

Okay, you can breathe normally again. You know, if you want to... </TEXT>

<TEXT> In that case, let me give you some feedback.

The pacing was a little strange, your transitions could be a bit more apparent, like when they suddenly appeared in the car (not the only place, but the most jarring). A simple page break might help the flow.

The story was witty and well written, otherwise, pretty much exactly what I'd hoped to see from this prompt.

My only real place of concern is the ending. It was funny, but dark, in a way that might put off readers. I thought it was good, but you may risk losing some of your audience with it. That said, it was just the right level of dark, suggested instead of stated.

Just my opinions, of course, but overall, nicely done! I hope you'll put more stuff out there! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have read (I don't recall where) that every character you create tends to represent a piece of yourself. The comic relief stems from your sense of humor, the hero or villain from your own morality, the support cast from the many highs and lows of your own ego or psyche. The best way to know any of them is to just let them talk.

It's all you, all your mind. You can't try and force the characters into a role. Let them tell you how they're going to act.

An example: I have a character in one of my works that I never planned to create. He started as a filler, who turned into a recurring theme, and after two or three rewrites, he's now a minor recurring character, with his own history, motivations, and hardships to overcome. I didn't plan out any of it; once the character was "born," he told me all about himself.

I think I'm almost rambling now, so I'm gonna cut myself off here. Hope this helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If they knew the truth about me, theyd never let me live.

Im not insane. Im not evil. Im not dangerous. But knowing me is.

It started when I was born. The earliest memory I have is of a vaguely human face with golden eyes. For the longest time, I thought that face belonged to my mother. 

I remember it looking down at me, tilting side to side, swaying gently and cooing at me. I remember feeling the deepest love Ive ever known, lying in my crib.

My next memory had me walking, my mother kneeling in front of me and encouraging me onward. There was someone behind me, holding my hands and guiding me forward. Then I felt the support fall away, and I was afraid. I didnt want to fall, didnt want to get hurt. Out of fear, I pushed one foot forward, then the other, and eventually managed to waddle over to the safety of my mothers arms.

I dont know who the other person was. It might have been my father, but I never knew him. According to my mother, he died shortly after I learned to walk. I dont remember his face, or his voice, but I certainly havent missed him.

Mother tried to replace him, though. Time and time again, with one man after another. They all tried to worm their ways into my life - my heart - but they always ended up disappointing me. They hurt me - by spanking me, or shouting at me - and then they went away. I never knew where, but I assumed that my mother had sent them away because of what theyd done.

I didnt like it. They were nice men, but they always went away. I tried to be good, to be the model child, so that they would stick around. I liked feeling like I might have a father in my life.

But they always left. I didnt know what to do. I was so disappointed and hurt, every time they left. Eventually, that disappointment turned toward my mother.

The last man went away a week before my birthday. I tried to be a good son, I didnt want to hurt my mother by asking hard questions, but I just couldnt hold in my pain anymore. I asked her one day, where did they all go? Why did they leave?

She just looked at me sadly and said, I dont know, sweetie.

Such a cop out answer. She couldnt even tell me the truth? I know I was only four, but even then I could tell that there was something more going on.

I hated her for keeping the truth from me. I hated her for lying.

She died before my birthday. My present was being put in the foster care system.
It was a nightmare. I didnt know anyone. I didnt trust anyone. And nobody trusted me.

It didnt last long, though. In the night, a week after I arrived, almost everyone died. Some sort of freak gas leak, theyd said, made everyone suffocate in their sleep.

Everyone but me, and four other children. They were the only ones whod been nice to me until then, so I was glad.

I was lucky after that, when they sent the four of us to the same care house while they fixed the gas leak. We werent the only kids there - five more kids were already living in a four-parent home - but we knew each other, and that was enough. We all got along well enough.

Apparently, the parents liked us, because they said we could all stay, even after the gas leak was repaired. I was happy, but Lenny - one of the kids from the group home - said he wanted to go back. That made me sad.

He left without saying goodbye. The adults didnt want to talk about it when I asked where he'd gone, but I knew the truth. The traitor had left me.

But I still had the others. Derek, Angie, and Sarah.

We grew up together, the four of us. By high school, wed grown inseparable, the best of friends. We went everywhere together, did everything together.

One night, we went to the movies, all four of us. I wanted to sit next to Angie, but Sarah pushed her way in. Derek slipped in next to her, and Angie ended up at the far end. I was disappointed, but the movie looked good, so I didnt think about it much.

Halfway through, I realized Sarah was cuddling up against me. I looked over toward Angie, but she had fallen asleep against Dereks shoulder, so I just tried to ignore it and focus on the movie. It proved difficult, as Sarah had decided to start rubbing my arm.

I wouldnt say that Sarahs unattractive or anything, but I was never interested in her. I wanted Angie.

I tried to act nonchalant, to shift away so that Sarah would get the point, but she just slipped her hand down to my leg, idly rubbing along the outside as I focused on the screen.  Then, she slipped her hand down to my inner thigh, reaching up to grab my privates. 

I freaked out and jumped up, yelling, What the hell are you doing?!

And then I saw it. Angie had her head down in Dereks lap, but she wasnt sleeping. She pulled her head up with a *pop* at my outburst, clearly showing me her grip on Dereks turgid shaft, a line of drool still linking it to her lips.

I was at a loss. I walked out of the theatre, and though Sarah tried to chase me down and apologize, I left her standing in the lobby. I couldnt even speak.

I hated them all so much right then. Derek had my Angie. Sarah overstepped her bounds.

Angie had betrayed me.

I walked home, furious and fuming. I wasnt watching where I was going, and so its no wonder that about 45 minutes later, I crossed a street without looking. I was nowhere near an intersection, and honestly didnt care if I lived or died.

The first thing I noticed was the light. Not the horn, or the roar of the engine. A bright light, flooding the street around me. In that moment, I saw a face on the far side of the road, not ten feet from me.

The face was triangular, yet vaguely human, with golden eyes. It sat atop a body with limbs that bent strangely, and seemed too long for it. I was captivated by what I saw, and didnt notice the horn until it was too late to move.

Then the creature was gone with a *snap*, and I heard tires squealing. I spun wildly in place, just in time to see the oncoming truck swerve into the opposite lane of traffic, directly into a small blue Chevy.

It seemed to happen in slow motion. As the truck swerved, I saw the dark creature crouched on its roof, leaning over, almost like it was steering it. 

Just before the two vehicles smashed together, I recognized the blue car. It belonged to our foster parents, whod let us borrow it for the evening out.

Just after the impact, the windshield blew out by the force of the drivers momentum. Angies seat belt had snapped on either side of her chest, and trailed uselessly behind her like a death banner.

She skidded to a stop just feet in front of me, and didnt move.

I stared at her, numb, for what felt like forever, standing dumbly in the middle of the road. 

There was a soft *snap*, and the creature was back, crouching between me and Angie. It reached out a gnarled hand and stroked the side of my face gently, swaying its head from side to side and cooing softly.

And I felt more loved than I ever had.

Then it was gone, and a car pulled up. People poured out to help, calling the police, while I sank to the ground and stared at my childhood friends corpse.

As I sat on the curb watching them load my friends bodies onto the ambulance, I knew they were all dead. 

And I knew it was my fault.

The police came to me eventually, with a blanket, of all things. The officer asked me what happened, and I told him. They died because of me.

He wrote it off, said it was an accident.

I insisted. He didnt listen. 

I got mad, yelling. Dont you get it?! They pissed me off, and now theyre dead!

He got serious then. Detained me for questioning, put me in his cruiser. We drove off toward the station, but didnt make it very far.

The last thing I saw before blacking out was a face with golden eyes, crouching in the road ahead.

I woke to the rhythmic beeping of hospital equipment. I knew without even looking that something was wrong with my left arm, and my chest burned like fire every time I breathed. 

They told me I was in an accident. The car had hit a tree, and I'd broken my arm and bruised a few ribs. The officer had died.

I knew why. Those golden eyes were with me, now. Theyd always been with me.

They were there when I was born.

At my first steps, watching alongside my parents, when my father scared me.

At my home, when all of the men in my life - and my mother - had let me down.

In the group home, when I was hurt and scared by everyone.

In my new home, when my friend abandoned me.

And now, when my closest friends betrayed me. When the officer enraged me.

I dont know what it is, but its following me. Its been following me all of my life. And even now, as I sit in a hospital room waiting for the police to come interview me again, I can see the golden eyes watching me from outside the window of this fifth-story ward.

Im not sure whats going to happen next, or how Ill be leaving this place, but one things for certain.

Nobody better fucking upset me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If a child misbehaves and isn't corrected, they will learn that it is acceptable to misbehave.

The same principle works for everyone. By covering for her, doing her work instead of yours, you are enabling her poor performance and enforcing it as 'acceptable' behavior.

 It's a pretty simple solution, here. Do the job you were hired to do, and leave her to suffer the consequences of her own inaction. She'll either improve, or fail and get fired. Either way, she'll earn whatever comes on her own.

<TEXT> I'm gonna go ahead and stop you right there. 

You can't go into writing trying to appeal to "X" group. You write what feels like it should be written. If your character needs a mentor, give that to him/her/it. If a father figure is what's needed, give that. Sensei, leader, Sarge, whatever comes to the story when you need it, *that* is what you put in.

The second you lose focus on your own inspiration and start trying to appeal to some outside group, is the second you begin to lose your intrinsic artistic fire as a writer.

-----
*He looked out over the fence at the ice-blanketed pond. It stretched out some tens of yards to the low stone wall, which wound along the edge of Gregory Boulevard, which itself stood before a ten-storey, forest-covered heap of mud encrusted with boulders.*

*"I should get a picture", he said aloud to no one*

-----

That's just to improve the grammar.

I tried to keep your adjectives in place. I would explain my editing choices, but really all I can say is that this version just makes more sense to me

As a reader, I would say you're being a bit too verbose. Why use 10 words when one could do?

Also, you've fallen victim to a classic writer's sin. Unnecessary use of long or uncommon words, which seem common to you, (such as encrusted, or aloud, or even using blanketed instead of covered or coated). These mess with the flow of the writing, even for educated readers. The thesaurus function on Word is your friend if you can't think of something relatably simple off hand.

Another suggestion, this time for reader's clarity.

<TEXT> My name is Miles Krieg. I am a freelance private investigator. And I am about to die.

I need to get this message out to as many people as I can. Anyone who might possibly come looking for me is at risk. This community is my last stop, the last place people might try to reach out to me. I'm telling you now, don't. Leave it alone.

What follows are the notes on my last case. It's not any sort of official transcript, I just like to write down everything related to a case, to help myself remember any minor detail that might help.

I'm glad I did. Without these notes, I might not have made the connection. It's too late for me, but... hopefully I can keep others from suffering the same fate.

*From the desk of Private Investigator Miles Krieg*

**Case Journal #1: 4 January 2016**

Normally Id start out listing case notes and document control numbers for the official police paperwork. Let me start by noting that this is not an official police matter. I have not been commissioned, and dont expect reimbursement for my time.

A close friend of mine died tonight. A good man, a man Ive worked with on many cases in the past. Senior forensic pathologist Daniel West, at the city morgue, has given me more leads on homicides over the last decade than any amount of footwork. He was, quite possibly, the least selfish man Ive ever known.

Certainly not a man who deserved to be murdered.

Im getting ahead of myself.

At approximately 10:30 yesterday evening, I received a call from Daniel on my personal line. That in and of itself was an indicator that something was wrong. You see, Daniel never called me outside of the office unless there was a break in an active case, and Id not taken any new cases since before the new year. There was nothing on my plate, so he had no reason to call me directly unless it was urgent.

I didnt even have time to properly answer before he interrupted.

No time, he stated as soon as I picked up, his tone brisk and harried. No time, just listen. I think something bad is about to happen.

I remember my pulse quickening. Daniel loved to talk, always using ten words where one would do, so his clipped sentences caught my attention like a gunshot. Whats wrong?

I saw something I shouldnt have, and now I  aaugh!! He cried out - a loud, nonsensical sound, pained but not urgent, like someone had just pressed on a broken bone.

Daniel! Are you alright?

No, he grunted. No, Im not alright. Im afraid.

Afraid of what? 

I think Im going to die next.

My blood chilled at the sincerity in his voice. Where are you? Are you at work?

No! Daniel cried out, loud enough I had to pull the receiver from my head. NO!!

At home, then? Daniel!

Dont! he shouted, and then he screamed. A long, primal scream of rage and pain. Stop! Stop, damn you, why wont you stop?!

I heard the phone drop and bounce on his end, and knew Id gotten all I would out of him. He hadnt told me where he was, but he needed help, so I had to work it out for myself, and fast. I steeled myself, took a quick, slow breath to steady my pounding heart, and looked at the facts.

Hed said no about being at work, but given what had come after, that may have just been in response to his assailant's arrival. However, when he dropped the phone, it sounded like it had landed on some sort of thick fabric. I knew that the morgue didnt have any carpets, and he wouldnt have called me if he hadnt known I could find him, so he must have been home. 

It wasnt much to go on, but I didnt have time to waste. I was closer than the local PD, but just to be sure I gave them a call on my way out the door. I told them about the call, and that there was possibly an intruder in Daniels house, and dispatch told me an officer was on the way.

I knew their response time was slower than mine, though, so I booked it to the stairwell, because I like my exercise. 

Okay, mostly because the buildings elevators were slower than cold syrup. Anyway.

I got to Daniels home in about five minutes. It was a tiny house, the sort youd call a cottage if he lived in the woods rather than the suburbs. Hed lived there all his life with his mother, whod left it to him when she died some ten years ago. The front door was locked, so I just grabbed his key from under the mat and opened it up. 

Side note: It didnt occur to me until I wrote it just now, but there were no signs of forced entry. Locked door, no cracks on the frame, no broken windows. Well, thats what these journals are for, to help piece things together after the fact.

I threw open the door and called for Daniel, but heard nothing in reply. I ran through to his room, threw open the door, and saw him lying on the ground in a pool of blood.

My stomach heaved at the coppery smell, but I rushed to his side to check his vitals. He had a pulse, but only just. Quickly, I checked the rest of him. No chest wound, nothing on his neck, so where was the blood coming from?

Then I saw. His right ear was missing.

Oh, god, I remember hearing. I suppose it was me. 

I looked around frantically for something to block the wound, and ended up grabbing his bedsheets. As I pulled them over to press against his head, something tumbled onto my lap.

His ear.

I dont know how much time passed before the police arrived, but Im glad now that Id had the foresight to call them ahead of time. I was in no fit state to do anything until well after they dragged me away from my dying friend. My mind went somewhere else, screaming blindly into the darkness.

Numbly, I watched them load him up into the ambulance. I was herded into a police car, and we followed him to the hospital. Midnight came and went, I sat blindly in the ER waiting area for hours, barely blinking until a doctor came out sometime around dawn.

Hes lost a lot of blood, I was told, but hes stabilized. Weve had to sedate him, so hes resting now, but you can go see him if you like. Just dont expect much of a response.

I stayed behind at first, not wanting to face my mutilated friend again. The images of his pallid face, his ear falling into my lap were still fresh. I know theyd probably managed to reattach it, but I just couldnt seem to drag myself up from my seat. I watched all day long as his coworkers and friends flowed in and out of his room, all teary-eyed but grateful that hed survived the ordeal.

Finally, around mid-afternoon, I pushed myself out of the chair and went in to see him. Everyone else had gone by now, so it was just me and him in the room.

In stories, people often speak of how peaceful their loved ones look in a hospital bed, as though theyd be fine once they wake up. Daniel didnt look fine. Even in his drugged sleep, with bandages wrapped around his head, he looked tortured.

I was scarcely there a minute before his eyed fluttered open.

No, he groaned, his voice terribly hoarse, as though hed screamed all the life out of it. No, no, no

Danny? I said. Youre awake?

No, no It hurt me to hear him like that.

Danny, who did this to you?

It was him

Who?

The man in the cell Wilcox.

Whos Wilcox?

Last week died in the cell I did the autopsy. Ever since his voice faded, his eyes scrunched up in pain.

Danny, please, did you find something? Is someone after you?

I cant I cant, you have to go, or itll get you, too! He started getting louder, now, despite his hoarseness.

What will? Danny, what is it?

Cant you hear it? he rasped. The screaming It wont stop, it wont stop

What screaming? What do you mean?

It wont stop It never stops! Power came back in his voice as he spoke, frantic volume pushing the rasp aside.

Then he started screaming. 

It was worse than before. Pain, rage, suffering, desperation, as though he'd lost all sense or reason. I saw his heart rate monitor start racing, but the tone completely lost under his voice. I raced over to the call button to get a nurse in, though Im sure it wasnt necessary at this point, but he fell silent before I reached it.

I mashed the button, one-two-three-four, before I realized what I was hearing now. A high ringing in my ears.

Daniels heart monitor had flat-lined.

I looked up, and he lay there, unnaturally still. Looking at him, something shifted inside of me. Outrage, fear, hatred. I had to find the man whod done this to my friend.

The nurse was there in a second, ushering me out of the room. I waited around long enough to hear them officially pronounce him dead before heading home.

My first step was writing out these notes. As I said before, my involvement in this case is not police sanctioned. Thats one of the perks of being freelance  as long as I dont get caught doing illegal things, Im free to pursue my own cases. No, my involvement here is purely personal. Im going to find out who would do this to poor Daniel. Once I do, well well see what happens.

My only lead right now is Wilcox. Ill have to look into that in the morning. Hopefully I can get a look at his case file, but itll be tricky with my best contact lying dead on a slab. Ill figure it out, though. 

I always do.

**Case Journal #2: 7 January 2016**

My head hurts.

I didnt react well to Daniels death. After I finished my last journal entry, I had a whiskey to calm my nerves.

And then another. And then a few more. 

I ended up draining a fifth that evening, and passed out until late the next morning. Hungover, head pounding, ears ringing, I felt like Id been laid out on the tracks and hit by every car in a mile-long train. I barely got to my feet to brew up a pot of coffee, which I drained in short order. The caffeine cleared my head a bit, but I knew I was in for a rough day.

I didnt have much luck at the station that day. Even though everyone on hand was still in shock from Daniels passing, they were amazingly tight-lipped about this Wilcox fellow. Even the receptionist, Lara  a sweet thing, not too bright, but more than willing to do anything to catch my eye, poor dear  even Lara was less chatty than normal. Even my last-ditch effort of asking her to lunch in exchange for information didnt bear the fruit it normally did.

For the record, I feel bad every time I lead her on to get case information, but sometimes youve just got to bite the bullet to get results.

I figured Id come in too soon, the wound was too fresh, so Id try again the next day (yesterday, now.) Plus, thatd give me time to kill my hangover.

Next morning, my ears were still ringing, but my head felt clearer. I hit the station bright and early to try and get more information, but was barely in the door when Chief Anderson pulled me into his office. The Chief was a lanky workaholic who almost never saw the sun, so he was pretty pale. We usually got along pretty well, despite my tendency to call him Casper now and again.

Krieg, he started  never a good sign, when he calls me by my last name  You need to leave this alone.

Leave what alone, Chief? Playing dumb often paid off with Anderson. He had a bad habit of letting out more information than he wanted to when I made him explain things.

The Wilcox case. Leave it alone. Its not your problem.

Why so nervous, Casper? You look a bit paler than usual.

Nothing. Its nothing. Andersons hands shook as he wiped his brow. Its just youre an asset, here, you know? Id rather have you on less risky cases.

Risky? I looked at him skeptically. Daniel said that Wilcox was dead. Whats the risk?

Andersons face flushed. I was on to something. But what?

Look, Miles, he said, struggling to stay calm. Why dont you go home? I know Daniels passing has to be sitting hard on you. You were his best friend around here, and Im sure you need time to cope. Go on, take a few days. Were not that busy here anyway.

I knew this was futile, so I threw up my hands in surrender. I left with no argument and no information.

I went back that evening, around shift change.

The station was packed full of people who were used to seeing me there, so nobody batted an eye at my presence. I even made small talk with a few of them as I worked my way over to where the case files were kept. Lucky for me, the station had transferred over to electronic filing in the last few years, so the newer documents were all online. A couple of people noticed me messing around over there, but they seemed satisfied with my claim that I was double checking on one of my recent cases. A quick search for Wilcox, sorted by date, brought up a short list of names, only one of which was dated within the last month.

I hit print, grabbed the papers, and was out before Anderson even knew I was there.

My head was pounding again by the time I got back home, so I took a few Ibuprofen and laid down with an ice pack on my head. Before I knew it, Id passed out. Residual hangover effects, I suppose. I hadnt had much to drink that day.

Which brings me to this morning. Woke up with my head pounding, ears ringing again, and quickly made a pot of liquid revival before sitting down to read the case notes regarding one Henry Wilcox.

The cops like to fill the pages with official terminology and other things to cause headaches, so Im just going to translate it here.

Wilcox had no police record prior to the third week of December. Hed never even had a reason to get in touch with them until one of his employees had apparently committed suicide at work. The intern, Keith Sanders, had been there only two weeks, and had seemed a little unstable the entire time, complaining about headaches and noises that no one else could hear. The day before they found him, hed been aggressive, and earlier that morning hed even gone so far as to violently shove a coworker aside whod brushed against him on the stairwell. They were about to let him go at the end of the workday because of it, but Keith had no way of knowing that.

According to Wilcoxs testimony, he was on the way to lunch that day, when someone screamed bloody murder in the middle of the office. When hed gone to investigate, hed found the intern lying dead on the floor with his right ear cut off. 

Reading that, I had a flash back to Daniels ear falling into my lap. Already, Id found a connection, but what about Wilcox?

Well, he was dismissed by the police without charges, and the death was ruled suicide by an official examination  by Daniel West.

The next page is where it got interesting, though. Apparently, just over a week later  the evening of the 26th, to be precise, a Saturday  Wilcox walked back into the station looking extremely agitated. Hed asked to talk to the lead on the Sanders case, claiming he had important information.

Well, they brought him back to the Officers desk for an interview, and thats where Wilcox, for lack of a better term, lost his shit. They papers say he had a manic episode, attacking the officer and two other people nearby before he was subdued and cuffed. They took him to a holding cell under suspicion of illegal use of narcotic substances, and they held him there overnight.

Apparently, his condition worsened. Not long after 11 oclock, he was shouting gibberish and crying, by midnight he was screaming and banging his head against the wall. He got so bad that they started processing him for transfer to a mental health institution.

Apparently, they werent fast enough. Wilcox beat his head against the wall hard enough to cave in the right side of his skull around the ear. He managed it when his guard wandered off for a cup of coffee, and was found by none other than my good friend Daniel West.

His death was ruled a suicide.

By this point in the case notes, I was already seeing a trend that I couldnt believe the police had overlooked. There were plainly connections here.

One: Daniels call to me, and his final moments, didnt sound like him at all. It was as though his mind wasnt working properly.

Two: Henry Wilcox, clearheaded and calm at his initial interview, comes back with information and then goes mad before he can deliver it, ultimately killing himself.

Three: The intern, Keith, found dead at work, who had exhibited similar behavior to Henry Wilcox before his death. To a different extent, of course, but similar.

And, of course, the ears.

My theory at this point is this: Keith was murdered. So was Wilcox, and so was Daniel. The killer seems to like to use hallucinogenic drugs to make his victims susceptible to his approach. Obviously more information is needed, but I believe that the killer knew Keith personally, perhaps even worked with him. That would explain how Wilcox had gotten new information a week later, and how hed been drugged before going to the cops  possibly in his coffee.

And Daniel, well the poor man must have found the toxin in Wilcoxs system during the autopsy, and the killer then went after him to cover his tracks.

Well. Thats all for today, I think. Im going to have to dig up more information on this Keith Sanders later. For now, perhaps a hot shower.

Note to self: make a doctors appointment to check for tinnitus. Your ear shouldnt still be ringing like this.

**Case Journal #3: 8 January 2016**

Its been a long day. I almost didnt make it to writing this out, but I need to follow my own rules. Gotta get it out while its fresh, so I dont forget anything.

Id better hurry, though, before the whiskey takes hold. Maybe thatll stop my damn ear ringing. Or at least make me not care. 

I swear its getting louder.

Anyway, today I followed up on the Keith Sanders lead. Chief Anderson didnt give me any grief when I went to check the official records on the guy  probably because there wasnt much to it. Cut and dry, suicide case, no other police record. Same as Henry Wilcox.

Same as Daniel. 

Luckily, Keiths former coworkers were willing to volunteer more information than was found in the official records. Turns out, he and Wilcox worked at a traffic control center. Specifically, in tollbooth operations. Keiths job was monitoring the live feeds from the cameras at automated toll crossings. Specifically, he monitored the high-occupancy vehicle lanes, looking for violators. Even more specifically, he had one-third of the city's main east-west highway. But thats not important. I think.

Anyway, from what I could tell, Keith had only been employed there for a couple of weeks before killing himself, which matches the police report. Most of his coworkers told the same tale as Mr. Wilcox  that Keith was a strange man, increasingly prone to paranoia and violence, and that he was expected to be let go soon. Nobody really knew anything about him, though. He never spoke of friends or family, and other than other office workers hed slighted, there was no clear sign that he had any enemies. Certainly nobody there seemed to have any real problem with him.

I double checked with the HR department, and was given access to his personal file. He had nobody listed as beneficiary on his life insurance, no emergency contacts except his now-deceased boss, and lived in a small apartment downtown. All in all, Keith seemed an extraordinarily boring man.

Then why would someone want to kill him?

Nothing was adding up, so I stuck around for a while, asking more questions. Eventually, I stumbled upon a lady named Evey, short for Evelyn, who seemed particularly put off by Keiths departure. She seemed almost taken with the man, which seemed at odds with what everyone else seemed to say about him. A little more questioning showed that he hadnt always been so strange. Apparently, in his first few days, Evey found him charming and sweet, and had fallen for him almost immediately. Her face soured when she told me about his gradual transformation over the next week.

Apparently, it started with him seeming distracted. A few days later, he started to complain about a ringing in his ears, and later still, pain. With the pain came agitation, and despite Eveys pleas, Keith didnt see a doctor. It would seem that he was used to living without insurance, and didnt want to risk a large medical bill over something minor.

Roughly three days before he died, Keith closed himself off from other people completely. He never spoke without shouting, so he just came in, did his job, and went home.

At this point, I thought Id finally found a connection, but it seemed not only weak, but frightening. Still, a lead is a lead, and I had to pursue it. 

I asked Evey whether Keith had witnessed a death recently, or found a body, within a day or two of his first symptoms.

Ill never forget the confusion on her face, and the dawning comprehension. 

Well, yes, she said slowly. On his monitors, he saw a woman run her car into a traffic pylon at the toll station. She was thrown out, if I recall, died instantly. Keith got a picture of it at his station, and called emergency services out to help immediately. You'd be surprised how common stuff like that is around here, one every months or so, so I didnt think anything of it at the time.

She looked at me with concern heavy on her face. Do you think that had something to do with it?

I shook my head, and quietly changed the topic, but Evey had already confirmed my worst fear.

There are only a few things each death has had in common so far.

First, each victim was the first person to find the previous victim after their murder. Yes, murder. I dont believe any of these deaths were anything less.

Second, each victim suffered from similar forms of uncharacteristic and increasingly erratic behavior in the days prior to their death. Very likely, they were drugged. Possibly something psychoactive, nerve agents or something. In any case, they all had similar symptoms, from what I can gather.

Third, upon their death, their ears are removed or mutilated. The killer does not take it with him/her; the act seems purely symbolic in a way I cant yet fathom.

After reviewing the facts, Im left with only one conclusion. There is a killer out there, preying on innocent bystanders. His M.O. is to track down the first person to find his last victim, and make that person his new target. He poisons them, somehow, and strikes when theyre at their weakest.

Unfortunately that can only mean one thing. 

I was the last person to see Daniel alive. I was the first person to see him dead. And ever since, my right ear hasnt stopped ringing. In fact, its getting louder. Its starting to hurt.

I believe I have been drugged. I believe the killer is after me. And I believe I dont have long.

Ive got to dig deeper, find more information. I have to be ready before he comes for me.

**Case Journal #4: 13 January 2016**

I am about to die.

I dont know who my murderer is. I dont know where it came from. I dont know if its human.

Ive run deeper into my investigation. The woman on the tollway, Leslie Bates, showed the same erratic behavior as the others in the week before she drove her car into the toll station.

Almost two weeks before that, Leslie had found her infant child boy in her crib. The child had been increasingly agitated and inconsolable for almost two weeks before he killed himself.

Yes. An infant committed suicide. Hed found a way to wedge his own right ear into the clasp on its crib gate, and hung from it until his fragile little neck popped. The only reason the parents noticed is because the incessant wailing had finally stopped.

Theyd thought it was a miracle, until they found him.

That infant had been born two weeks prior. On that day, an old man had escaped the hospital psych ward, stolen a security guards gun, and blew his brains out in the maternity ward. Guess where he aimed his shot? 

Yes, his right ear.

I couldnt find any more leads after him. Not a jot, not a trace. But the signs are clear.

The first person to see the victim dies, within two weeks.

It starts as a ringing in the ear, growing more persistent over time.

It never stops. It just gets louder and louder and *louder*.

Eventually it changes. The pain caused by the sound becomes physical. The ear starts to throb and itch, like somethings trying to claw its way out.

Or in.

Until you scream.

Once you do, it changes again. The pain rises, the noise changes, like a cacophony of demons wailing in hell, clawing at the inside of your ear, as though its the gateway for them to escape hell itself.

Ive already cut my right ear off, like the others, but I managed to stop the bleeding. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it didnt help at all. 

If anything, its just gotten louder. The screams sound excited now. Like Ive done well.

Like Ive done what they want.

Well, I wont have it. And they wont have me.

This is my final entry on the case. Whoever finds this, you must know. You cannot come looking for me. You must not find my body. Or else this will fate will befall you as well.

It should be no problem. Very few people explore the deep woods this far north. Almost nobody could ever find the abandoned cabin from my childhood. And certainly no one would dig through the ashes that will be left behind to find my charred remains in the basement. But just to be certain, I will print a copy of these notes to keep with me in a fire box. Hopefully it will help whatever poor soul might happen upon me someday.

If you are that wretched soul, and you are reading this now, youve probably already noticed a ringing in your ears. 

If so

God help you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's pretty simple. People suck, as a general rule, and as such they will do sucky things, such as posting movie spoilers or causing genocide.

You can't trust people you see day to day, let alone the faceless assholes on the internet who answer to no one but their inbox - which they probably ignore anyway.

That said, social media has no solid, lasting impact on your life. The most poignant things put on facebook, twitter (fucking twits), etc, are usually song lyrics written decades ago by artists they've likely never actually heard of (fucking Glee).

So, trust the stupid and inconsiderate to be stupid and inconsiderate. It's what they do.

<TEXT> I'm not sure about the real-world prices for these things, but as the father of a five-year-old, I've seen more episodes of Spongebob than the Simpsons, and there are several occasions where they state the menu prices on the show, both referenced by the characters and written on the menu. As the seasons have worn on, the prices have varied from $1 to $5 per patty. 

Going off of those prices,  and given that there have also been dozens of episodes where the one and only cook at the restaurant is sent home early until he resolves some problem or other, thereby shutting down the restaurant's production entirely, it would seem that the Krusty Krab turns a significant profit. I would guess that Krabby Patties are made of faux meat, probably produced from coral or seaweed (abundant in the ocean), and therefore cost somewhere in the vein of pennies on the dollar to produce.

Also, it just occurred to me that I don't recall any episode specifically referring to the krabby patty as "meat." It's always just been called a patty. So, there's that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Panting, Steve sprinted up the parapets of the castle he'd spent the last several months building. A low growl sounded from somewhere above him as he neared the top of the cobblestone staircase.

He leapt out of the tiny guardhouse at the top of the stairs, spinning wildly as he flailed about with his diamond sword. There was a wet thunk and a groan, and Steve smiled as the Zombie poofed, leaving chunks of rotten meat on his newly masoned roof.

He made a note to clean that up later.

With a determined look, he braced himself and turned toward the spire in the middle of his castle. On the very top of the turret stood the one responsible for his night's grief - a dark figure, holding the glowing stone he'd so painstakingly rebuilt from fragments salvaged from the most hellish plane of existence.

The enderman had stolen it at sundown, just as Steve was returning from his day's foraging. This had plunged the entire library into darkness, leading to an unexpected infestation.

Steve had been woefully unprepared for the encounter, falling to nearly one heart as he fought to escape. He'd only just reached his weapons stash in time to defend himself from the skeleton that had chased him in, but it was all for nothing. His armor had broken, his health was failing, and a creeper had blown up his food store.

He'd been lucky to make it to the roof, gnawing on the flesh of his fallen foes in an attempt to regain a modicum of strength. His stomach rebelled, but he knew it would help in the long run.

Now that he'd fought his way clear of the castle, he knew his saving grace. Catch the enderman, destroy it, and restore the sacred light to its rightful place.

Thunder crashed as he stepped forward, and Steve's heart froze as the first raindrop touched his skin.

Then enderman shrieked, and with a dull *zzapp*, teleported away.

Steve could only watch in horror as his precious light source popped in and out of existence across the open field, finally disappearing seconds later to Notch only knew where.

With the light source gone, Steve was at a loss. The sun wasn't due up for hours, and even then, his castle was infested with the undead. Sure, he had a torch or two left, but he wasn't sure if he'd even be able to fight his way down to the library, let alone fix it.

Suddenly, a low *kssss* echoed up the stairwell begin him.

Steve gripped his sword tightly in one hand, and his torch in the other, feeling his resolve hardening.

"That is *it!*" he cried out to the night sky. "I have *had it* with these *motherfucking* creepers in my *motherfucking* home!"

Steeling himself, he charged, screaming, into the stairwell. He swung mightily as he saw the black of the creature's eyes, but his heart sank when he saw four more of the green menaces right behind its falling corpse.

*kssssss-ksssss-kssss*

"Aw, hell."

Sound vanished as everything was washed in a spray of red. Steve's final thoughts before losing conscious we were only this:

*You cannot respawn in hardcore mode!* </TEXT>

<TEXT> ***continued***

Aghast, i stumbled down the steps, sprinting back to my house as Mrs. Sawyer's remains swirled away on the breeze. Hands shaking, I locked the front door and grabbed my phone. No way was I going to work today, after that. I stammered off a vague excuse, dropped the handset, and went to lay in my bed.

The world was swimming. I thought about Sandra and her husband, and Mrs. Sawyer's prediction for them. As my mind wandered, I found myself plagued with terrible thoughts about everyone I could imagine knowing them - not their reactions to this event; instead, I saw a series of interactions that would inevitably lead to their deaths.

Before long, the headache came back, a shooting pain that blocked out my ability to function. I could barely move, barely even breathe for the pain.

*knock, knock.*

The terrible din of a gentle tapping on my front door tore through my consciousness, and I slowly made my way to answer it.

"Excuse me, sir," a harried-looking man said when I opened the door. "My car broke down, can I borrow your phone?"

My eyes screwed shut in pain as his words tore at my eardrums like knives. Instinctively, I reached out to hush him, missing completely and laying my hand upon his forehead instead.

Somewhere behind the darkness of my eyelids, I saw an old woman, smiling at me as I lay in a hospital bed. She gently whispered something, wiping a stray hair off my brow, and as the vision faded, I saw a tear slip down her cheek.

My eyes popped open to find the man staring at me in utter shock.

"W-what the hell was that?"

I felt a smile creep over my face as I realized that the headache had vanished. 

"That's how you are going to die." 

My voice was full of wonder at the realization, for it was so much more than I had said. After I released the man, I saw every step of his journey toward death. I saw the people he would influence, and the paths that would be taken by those who would never meet me, as influenced by his knowledge from this meeting. I saw all of their deaths, as well.

I even saw the people he would drive toward me, whose lives I would set on a new path.

As the man slowly backed away from me, I realized something that made me giddy with a new kind of fear. I had become the catalyst, the eye of the storm. Somehow, I had become the common factor in countless lives - no, *every* life.

I had become death.

And for thousands of years, there has been nothing I could do about it.

Until now.

Now, it's your turn.

<TEXT> Mrs. Sawyer had been my neighbor for two years before I finally knocked on her door.

I'd been warned about her by my realtor before buying the house. Apparently, she was regarded as some sort of witch by the locals - a fortune teller, or something. I couldn't get any solid information about her, but apparently her clientele, who she served all hours of the day, often left screaming, crying, or pleading with her.

I didn't think anything of it at the time, figuring that my realtor was just disclosing an urban legend, or perhaps blowing up the story so that i would pick a different place, sending her a bigger payoff from the sale.

I should have realized, though. No home gets sold for a quarter of its value without good reason.

The first few weeks, I didn't notice anything strange. Mrs. Sawyer had dozens of people come and go, all all hours of the day, and not one of them made any ruckus like I'd been warned of. I'd basically forgotten about the warning, in fact, until one night on my fifth week in that house.

I was jarred out of sleep by a piercing wail. I'd never heard such a mournful cry before, and I stumbled upright and over to the open window to see what in the hell was going on outside.

Was someone hurt? Dying?

To my surprise, I saw the front door of Mrs. Sawyer's house standing open, spilling light down the sidewalk and over the figure of a wisp of a woman leaning again the white picket fence. I saw her sobbing as Mrs. Sawyer calmly walked down her steps, approaching the distraught woman.

Curious, I leaned out the window. What the hell was going on?

"W-why?" the girl managed between sobs. "Why would he do that to me?"

Mrs. Sawyer shook her head. "I cannot say. You asked to see, and now you must live with the knowledge."

The girl moaned, somehow even more pitifully than before. After a moment, she peeled herself off of the fence, trudging slowly off into the dark.

Mrs. Sawyer looked up at my house, eyes twinkling. I was pretty sure it was too dark for her to see me, but I could feel her eyes digging into my soul.

Then, just like that, she turned around and went back into her house, closing the door just as a pair of headlights pulled around the corner of the block.

Completely confused at what I'd just witnessed, pulled my head back in as the bus drove by my house. I hadn't made it back to bed before I heard the squeal of brakes, followed by a wet thud.

Looking out again, I saw the taillights of the bus, still swaying from the swerve. As it vanished into the distance, I noticed the body lying in the road, not far from Mrs. Sawyer's house. 

With a gasp and a cry, I grabbed my cell phone and sprinted outside as I dialed 911, not even stopping to put on pajama pants or shoes. I sprinted across the damp grass in just my boxers, leaping over the curb as I reached the road.

I found a pulse just as the phone connected. I told the operator what had happened, and she told me to leave the girl still and direct traffic around her until the ambulance arrived.

While I waited for them to arrive, it occurred to me: The bus had been on the other side of the street from the girl. There was no reason for this girl to have been hit on accident.

I watched the girl's chest rise and fall with slow labored breaths as the sirens approached, wondering all the while: What had Mrs. Sawyer shown her?

-----------

**Edit 1:**

The next day, I started looking into the rumors about Mrs. Sawyer. 

There wasn't much to go on, to be honest. Some people claimed that she could see the future. Others claimed that she could only see death. Many of the latter even claimed that she cursed people with specific, gruesome deaths.

I didn't know what to believe.

It was apparent, though, that something odd was happening in Mrs. Sawyer's house. Within the next two weeks, I heard at least four more people screaming at her from inside her house, or out in her front yard.

"It can't be true!"

"Take it back! *Take it back!*"

"You lying witch!"

Each time, I watched through my window until it ended. Each time, she looked up at me with that piercing gaze, somehow finding me even behind my curtains at night.

Each time, I shuddered.

------------

There were lulls in Mrs. Sawyer's business, it seemed. Weeks of silence, followed by shouts and curses, day after day. Sometimes they were longer intervals, sometimes shorter, but I never saw a shortage of clients entering or exiting her house.

Finally, after about three months of this, there was a knock on my door. I opened it up to see a harried-looking man standing on my front step.

"Um," he said, standing there awkwardly. He was carelessly shaven, his eyes sunken and tired. 

After a moment I threw him a bone. "Hello."

"Um. Hi. Um. The, uh, the doctors say that you're the guy who called the ambulance for Sandra?"

I stared at him for a moment, confused, before remembering. "The lady who got hit by the bus?"

He nodded. "My wife, yes. Um." He rubbed his forearms anxiously. "She... she's in a coma now."

"Oh." I didn't know what else to say. How do you respond to something like that out of the blue?

"Yeah. Um. But, she'd be dead if you hadn't called. Um." He rubbed his arms some more. "My therapist said I need to focus on positive things. So, I wanted to see the man that saved Sandra. Um. And thank him. You. Um."

I smiled weakly. "Yeah. Sure. No problem."

He nodded, still fidgeting. "Well. Yeah. Um... okay. I'll let you get on with your day, then."

And with that, the man wandered away, eventually climbing into a poorly-parked SUV and driving off.

--------------

I didn't think of that man, or the lady I'd saved, until more than year later.

I was drinking my morning coffee and reading the newspaper before work, when my eyes fell on a small article on the corner of page 2. The words "Hit-and-run" and "Sandra" caught my eye, and I leaned in to read further.

*Hit-and-run victim Sandra Cummings was found dead in her hospital bed yesterday morning after spending nearly two years in a coma. Sandra was struck by an oncoming vehicle in a local suburb around 2 AM on the night of August 18th, 2013. Her injuries were severe, but she was saved by a nearby homeowner (who has chosen to remain anonymous) who witnessed the incident and called emergency services. Sandra was rushed to Carlisle County Medical Center, where she underwent emergency surgery. Her life was saved, but she fell into a coma during recovery, and had been in that state ever since.*

*Sandra's husband, Larry, stayed by her side throughout her ordeal. Loyal to the end, he was even there the morning she died, quietly crying next to her.*

The article went on, but I stopped reading. I suddenly remembered the man who'd appeared at my door all those months ago, how distraught he'd looked. That must've been Larry. And what was it Sandra had said the night she'd jumped in front of the bus? *"Why would he do that to me?"*

I jumped up from the table suddenly, a sick feeling in my stomach. I left my coffee sitting on the table as I strode outside, heading toward Mrs. Sawyer's house.

I stood in front of her door for a full minute before knocking, my heart pounding heavily. The door opened almost immediately, creaking slowly inward on rusted hinges.

"I've been waiting for you," Mrs. Sawyer said. "Ever since you bought that house. I knew you'd come knocking eventually."

I stood there, my voice lost, pulse drumming in my ears.

"You want to know what I do, yes?" Mrs. Sawyer smiled grimly at me. "It's not pleasant. I show people how they will die. Nothing more. Nothing less. Many... cannot take it. The manner of their death breaks them. Some even take steps to escape it."

"Sandra," I finally said. 

She nodded. "Yes. I remember her well. You saw her reaction. You saved her life. And in doing so, you ensured she would meet the end I saw for her."

I shuddered. "What did you see?"

She sighed, smirking wistfully. "I saw her in bed, asleep. I saw her husband smother her with a pillow."

Goosebumps rose on my arms. Seeing my reaction, she nodded.

"You've already heard of her death then."

"Yes."

"You doubt my prediction?"

"No."

She cocked her head to one side. "Would you like me to read you?"

I hesitated only briefly, but nodded. 

She reached out her hand, gently pressing her palm against my forehead.

I felt a sudden jolt, like a million volts of electricity jumping between us. Instantly, my head felt like it was about to explode. I had no vision, just the sudden, throbbing headache.

"What happened?!" I moaned. 

Mrs. Sawyer laughed, a sweet, musical sound. "Oh, thank god! I was beginning to think I'd never be free."

"Free? From what?" I grunted through the pain. I forced my eyes to focus on her. I blinked - her hair was greying before my eyes!

"I've been cursed with the Sight for thousands of years. Now I can be free!"

"I don't understand," I gaped. She was aging rapidly as I watched, wrinkles appearing and stretching across her features, skin sinking in around her bones.

"You will, in time," she said, grabbing my hand in her own. I felt her bones rapidly growing brittle as she pressed my palm against her own forehead.

Another flash of pain, and I saw the two of us standing there through her eyes. She released my hand, spoke, and then the vision faded, along with the pain.

My eyes opened to see her smiling. She was almost mummified as she released my hand.

"Well, that's not so bad," she said, before collapsing into dust.

<TEXT> Five days.

Five days, they'd said, and they'd be back for me.

I open my last bottle of water and shake a few precious drips onto my tongue, and throw it aside in disgust. It bounces once in the dark box, landing between my legs with the rest.

So thirsty. Those jerks.

Five days... Or was it six? Hard to keep track.

I check my watch, but the glow had stopped working two days ago. I guess I'd worn out the button, checking it that often.

They'd said I'd be safe here, while they sorted things out. They'd held the money for me, so that there would be room for the water.

So hungry...

So thirsty...

So tired...

<TEXT> (Part 2)
*		*		*

We were inseparable after that night. Our respective worlds merged, and we just about flew through life on wings of joy. Sooner than anyone ever expected, only two years later, we were engaged.

Leslie, my precious Rainbow, was pregnant less than two months after the wedding.

At the baby shower, when Leslie was about eight months along, Susan and Jim showed up. Susan had turned a greyish-yellow color, and seemed to be cradling her arm. She glanced up at me as she set a hastily-wrapped box on the table, and then moved to the living room without a word.

She didnt need to speak, though. Her color shifted to vibrant green at the sight of Leslies hand in mine. 

Then Jim walked in, and I reeled back in shock. I hadnt seen much of him over the last couple of years. Wed been in touch often enough, but one of us or the other had always found some way to avoid actual face to face contact since my initial trip to the hospital.  On the rare occasion it hadnt been avoidable, Id taken the cowards way out. 

I told him I was blind, just so I wouldnt have to look at him, to see how bad he looked now.

He caught me off-guard, stepping into the kitchen without his usual flair of a greeting, and what I saw now was worse than Id feared. Hed turned a sickly, mottled green, like rotting, boiled spinach, but even that was drowned out by the veiny, pulsating blackness Id seen in him before. It had spread through his being, overtaking almost all of the putrid green.

I pretended I didnt see him and told my wife that I felt claustrophobic, stepping outside before anyone could speak.

She joined me a bit later, and I noticed that her colors were marred with a grey haze. That had never happened before.

Whats wrong with him? she asked. What did you see?

I shook my head. I dont know. 

She shivered. Susan was hurt, she said. I know you couldnt see, but her arm was bruised. I think hes hurting her.

My head pounded from what Id just seen, my heart raced. I hugged my Rainbow for a minute, taking comfort in her presence. 

What do we do? she asked.

What could I say? I dont know.


*		*		*


Nothing happened at the shower.  I wish it had.

Jim sat quietly the whole time, across the room from his wife.

Susan spoke softly, avoiding eye contact with anyone.

He was a dark presence in the corner of the room.

She faded constantly from a sickly grey-yellow, to bright, verdant green when she looked at me.

I should have seen the signs. I should have done something.

We were washing up after the shower had ended. The sun had set, the last guest had gone home long ago. Leslie and I were having fun washing the dishes. Wed made a game of it some time ago  it was basically a race to see who was faster, the washer or the rinser. I was rinsing that night, and I kept sneaking clean plates back onto her side of the sink. Yeah, I cheated. We both did, usually, and that was part of the fun.

Then we heard the gunshot in Jims house.

A plate crashed to the floor. I dont know who dropped it.

Leslie grabbed the phone and called the police while I rushed outside. I started toward Jims house, but stopped short at the sight of a horrible figure moving toward me. It was a solid, deathly black, and it was pointing something at me. Even without the ability to see colors, the shape was clear enough.

Jim had a pistol aimed at my chest.

She wanted you for years, he growled. Years!

Jim Jim, calm down, I said Whats going on?

I waited, Greg. I waited, and then you found your girl, and I still waited for my own GODDAMN WIFE TO LOVE ME!

It hit me then like a freight train. The green from Susan, the color of lust, every time she looked at me. The blackness in Jim, growing darker and darker over time. 

The gunshot.

Oh, no, I said. No, Jim, what have you done?

He took a while to respond, but when he did, I was shaken to my very core.

She wants you so bad, he mumbled, she can have you.

My blood turned to ice as he raised the gun.

Jim, I plead. Jim, please-

He fired, and I was thrown to the ground.


*		*		*


I could barely breathe as the ambulance sped us toward the hospital.

My insides hurt. My chest felt like it had been ripped open. I couldnt talk, couldnt focus on of the faces around me. I was only vaguely aware of where I was.

Stay with us, the paramedic said. Keep breathing, come on.
I couldnt focus on his words. My world was clenched in my right hand, and I held on for dear life.

My Rainbow. 

She didnt let go of me when the ambulance stopped, wouldnt release while the ER staff ran us through the hospital toward surgery. She fought for every second she could get. Finally we hit a door, and the orderly had to pry her hand off of mine.

Her color had turned red, overlaid with grey. She was afraid.

As they wheeled her away, my heart shattered.

Shed saved my life by sacrificing herself, shoving me aside as Jim fired.  Id heard a second shot, and Jim collapsed to the ground, but I didnt care. Id rushed over to Leslie, my Rainbow, and tried to tell her it was okay.

She ended up comforting me the whole time. 

She was a stronger person than I ever could be. She was my light and my life in this world, and then

The doctor came out hours later. They couldnt save her. 

They wouldnt tell me about the baby.

They let me go in to say goodbye. I almost didnt have the strength, but I remembered her courage, the sheer force of her will, and I went in.

I cried. I tried to speak to her, to thank her for everything shed ever done, but my mouth wouldnt work.

My Rainbow was now the same featureless black as everything else in the room.


*		*		*


I dont know how long I cried over her body. The doctors gave me all the time I needed, though, and I walked out of the surgery room feeling completely drained. My world had been stolen from me so suddenly, and I wasnt sure how Id go on.

Friends and family came to talk me through the ordeal, but they werent much solace. It hurt too much for simple words to help.

But then the doctor stepped out, and said seven words that revived a piece of my soul.

Would you like to meet your daughter?

I followed him to the nursery, numb. I couldnt see through the glass, but the nurse wheeled out a small bassinet for me. 

Shes perfectly healthy, said the doctor. Go ahead, pick her up if you want to.

I peered into the basket, and my heart melted. For a brief instant, all of the pain of the last few hours faded to the background. I gingerly lifted my newborn, cradling her head against my chest as I watched the rainbows dance across her face.

<TEXT> My name is Greg Martin, and I am blind.

I used to be able to see things the same way as you, in all its Technicolor glory. In fact, until a short while after I turned twenty six, everything was fine, visually speaking. I saw trees of green, red roses too, hehe 

Sorry. I like the classics, what can I say? 

Anyway, I should probably go on with the story. It was early summer when my vision went away. I remember that day clearly, because its the day I first saw her. Its funny, because if Id seen her before it happened

You know what? Im getting ahead of myself. Lets go back to the beginning.


When I woke up, everything was black.
And I dont mean that in, you know, the typical sense, like darkness and such. I mean, literally, everything was black. My ceiling, walls, bed, windows, hell, even the glass, everything was the same, stark, monochrome black. I could see shapes, textures, and edges, but all of the color had been leeched away from my world. 

At first I thought Id been pranked while I slept. In retrospect, that was absurd; theres no way even a team of people could have come in and painted my house and all of my belongings black. 
Anyway, I stumbled out of bed, grumbling, tossing my now-black sheets to the floor. I trudged over to the window and hauled it open, cursing every name I knew who could possibly have been connected to this.

My eyes widened in shock.

The ground outside was black. The houses, the mailboxes, the cars, all had been changed to the same matte black shade as my bedroom

But the most shocking thing of all was the sky.

As far as I could see, this blackness enveloped the world. The sky was black as anything, and the clouds above were puffs of black cotton over it.

To say that I freaked out would be a bit of an understatement. I started yelling and howling like a gibbon, debating the possibility of all this with myself. I tried to logic through it, but couldnt manage to reach any reasonable conclusion.

Only one thing was certain. Either something terrible had happened to the world, or I had somehow spontaneously lost my ability to see color of any sort.

Okay, Greg, I thought. Breathe. Work through this. What can you do?

It took a bit of thinking, but finally I realized the only sane thing to do in this situation.

Find a doctor.

So, I found my keys, made my way into the garage, and slipped into the car. It didn't take long for the glaring problem to become apparent.

The windows were solid, opaque black. Just like everything else.

I sighed, letting my head fall and bounce on the steering wheel. 
What else could I do?

The neighbors.

Yes, Jim and Susan. They could help. 

I left the keys in the car and went outside. The street was empty this time of the day. Every adult was at work, every kid was at school, and every dog was locked in the back yard. All that faced me was a charred representation of what should have been my green and verdant lawn.

My heart pounded in my chest as I stepped out. It was strange, stepping out across the darkened expanse. I cant properly describe to you just how wrong it felt.

Imagine you had a kid. Raised it for years. Saw all of its firsts, all of its falls, all of its growth and achievements.

Then imagine that, one day, you woke up, and the kid was gone. In its place was someone else. Someone you didnt know.

No, wait, thats typical parenthood around the teens. See, I told you I couldnt do it.

Anyway, I made my way over to Jim and Susans, but only made it about halfway before something caught my eye. Just as I walked around the tree at the edge of my lawn, I noticed a color.

Thats right, a color!

Not much of one, just an extremely light blue, almost grey, but it might as well have been a rainbow in the darkness of my world.

I turned and looked closer, and my jaw dropped. You see, this tree had been infested with fire ants for weeks. Id tried various home remedies to make them leave, but nothing had worked. Id been planning on going out that very day to get some actual pesticides and finish the job properly.

After what I saw that day, I could never bring myself to end another ant colony.

You see, the blue that Id seen was the path of the ants, a solid, pulsating line bisecting the tree from the ground to a tiny crack somewhere around shoulder height. I leaned in for a closer look, watching the tiny, frail-looking things as they marched up and down, like tiny ghosts coursing over the bark-textured darkness.

As I watched, another flash of blue caught my attention, darker this time, more pronounced, like an ocean wave. I tracked it to find a bird in flight  a mockingbird, by its shape  and my jaw dropped as I saw it join with another one of a slightly different shade. 

And as I watched, they danced around each other, flitting across the street, the houses, the lawns. Their colors shifted from blue, to teal, and finally to a deep green, before they flew out of my sight.

I dont know how long I was standing there, staring spellbound at the spot where the birds had vanished, before a voice broke into my awareness.

Greg? Jim called out from his porch. I glanced idly toward him  and then did a double take at what lay before my eyes.

It was still Jim, in every way. Same curve of the jaw, same typical button-up Hawaiian shirt he always wears on his day off. I mean, I assume it was Hawaiian. I couldnt really tell what color it was supposed to be.

What made my stomach churn, though, was how I now saw him. Jim appeared to me as a sickly green, like cooked spinach and baby vomit. Worse still, he seemed to have spindly black veins coursing over his entire person, pulsating like a beating heart.

Oh, god, I uttered.

Whats the matter, bud?

I dropped to my knees, shaking. Um, I said slowly. Um. I think I need a doctor.

He came toward me, and I averted my eyes, staring at the grass. I noticed a hint of brown between the charcoal blades  a beetle, crawling along.

Jim put his hand on me. You feeling alright?

No. I shied away. Somehow, I could still feel that disturbing color through his hand. Can can you ask Susan to drive me to the hospital?

Yeah yeah, sure. He backed off, and I felt a tension ease off of my shoulders as he raced into the house, calling for his wife. I slowly rose to my feet, and was leaning against their car when they came back out.

Susan was yellow. A bright, vibrant yellow, like a sunflower. She almost glowed. I frowned, because I recognized the cut of the dress she was wearing. It was supposed to be black, like her hair, but it was just as bright as everything else.

This was beginning to freak me out, but not as much as what happened next.

You okay, Greg? Susan unlocked the car for me, and I grunted uncomfortably as I slid into the passenger seat. I buckled in and waited while she gave her husband a goodbye kiss. Then she slid into the drivers seat, looked at me, and said, Dont worry. Well get you taken care of.

Looking directly at me, I saw her shift from yellow to green, ever so slightly. Then she focused on driving, and reverted back to her original color.

Just before she closed the door, however, I saw the blackness in Jim pulse, and grow ever so slightly.


*		*		*


I insisted that Susan leave me at the ER and go home. She argued with me, but I was stern about it. I wasnt about to die, and didnt need to be babysat. She reasoned that if I were too unwell to drive there, I shouldnt be on my own. I didnt tell her what was going on, but it was probably fairly obvious that I was in a fair amount of distress. I mean, Id just spent twenty minutes locked inside a black box I couldnt see out of.

It didnt really help that she kept fading from yellow toward green when she spoke to me. What did it mean?

I could tell that I wasnt going to get anywhere, so I signed in with her as my emergency contact and promised to call her as soon as I was out. She didnt like it, but agreed with me eventually, and left.

Four hours later, I was in the doctors office. He was an older man, late sixties by my guess, and to my new view of the world he was a dull red, like an overripe apple. 

He was also no help.

Inability to see colors is not an illness, young man, and people dont just change colors.

I know! I groaned. I wasnt getting anywhere. Its not normal. Something must be seriously wrong with me.

Look, son, I know when Im being played for a fool, the doctor said, setting down his clipboard. His redness brightened as his tone hardened. If you want drugs, you should at least try and come up with something borderline realistic.

But-

Get out.

Well, that was that. Four hours wasted, and Id gotten no closer to understanding what the hell was going on.

I didnt feel like calling Susan, and besides, I couldnt see the colors of my phone screen to dial anyone anymore. I decided to just take a walk, and hail a taxi or something later on.

That was a big mistake. I didnt think about the fact that, without being able to differentiate colors, Id lost most of the landmarks that I knew. All of the street signs appeared blank, every building faade was like a freshly cleaned chalkboard, with no indication of anything that had come before. I made it two or three turns down the road before I was completely turned around. Hailing a cab was out  I couldnt tell which of the cars passing by were yellow, or which of the ones with the vacant signs (I couldnt read them, but I recognized the shape) were lit. 

I didnt know what time it was  couldnt read my digital watch  but it must have been either closing time or lunch time. In any case, I was soon surrounded by people as I struggled to find my way through town. I was overwhelmed at first by the seething mass of chaotic colors around me  reds, blues, purples, every color of the rainbow and more. After a while, though, I started noticing things.

People talk, you know. You do it, I do it, and anyone who listens can learn about you if they took the time to pay attention to anyone but themselves. Well, on the street that day, I found myself focused on everyone who came near me, and I eventually realized something that rocked my world.

All of the colors I had been seeing  that I was still seeing, and still see to this day  were indicative of what lay at the core of a person. Red was passion, love or rage or dedication. Green was desire, lustfulness. Yellow was anxiety, uncertainty, or confusion. Blue was tranquility, peaceful serenity. 

There werent many of those around town at that time of day. Most of what I saw was yellow, shifting toward red at minor interactions with their surroundings.

I was baffled. How had this happened? What had I done to gain this ability?

I thought back to the day before, and nothing unusual came to mind. So I thought back to the day before that Still nothing. Further and further, nothing, nothing, nothing!

Eventually I sat. I couldnt think of anything else to do, so I sat, and watched the world go by.

It was the most beautiful day of my life, even before I saw her.

Id found my way to a fountain. It was interesting to see the water with my new eyes. I knew from experience that it was clear and clean, but I could see a faint blue tint across the dark surface, fainter than even the ghostly ants from that morning, swirling and spinning throughout the rippling black.

Think of liquid mercury, but take away the shininess. Thats about what the water looked like to me.

Anyway, I was sitting there watching the play of the blue on black for what must have been hours before she appeared to me. I wasnt even looking toward her, but she caught my attention as she wandered through my peripheral vision.

My heart skipped a beat, and my breath caught.

She glowed with every imaginable color, all at once. She was a literal beacon of light in the dark world Id found myself engulfed by. I would say she looked pearl white, because white is the presence of all colors in light, but that wouldnt be right. She was constantly shifting and flowing and ebbing with colors, each one an equal and great part of her core.

And she was walking away, cutting across the extreme corner of the square toward God knew where.

I dont think I thought about it. I jumped up and ran after her.

Excuse me! I called, and she looked up.

In the back of my mind, I saw her form. Plain face, plain clothes. Kind of frumpy, for lack of a better word. None of the typical trademarks of beauty, although she seemed to be at least trying to match current fashions.

What do you want? she asked suspiciously.

I swallowed. Im sorry to bother you, miss, I said before I could stop myself, but you are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in this world, and I couldnt let you just walk away.

She stared at me, and for a brief moment I wished I could suck the words back into my mouth, unspoken. As I stood there dumbly, though, her colors shifted, swirled, and writhed like a billion tiny flakes of glitter in a snowglobe, and I knew I couldnt leave it there.

My name is Greg, I said, stepping back slightly. And I know it sounds strange, but I would like nothing more than to know who you are.

And I stood there, waiting patiently while she analyzed me, colors shifting all the while. It couldnt have been long, but it felt like a lifetime that I sat there under the razors edge of her discerning gaze.

Finally, she stepped forward and extended her hand.

Leslie, she said.

We both smiled.


*		*		*


We talked for hours that day, and I ended up going back to her apartment. We just talked, and I slept on the couch. I spent that entire weekend with her talking about life, the universe, and everything, and I learned that Leslie was quite possibly the most fascinating person Id ever met. 

She was a psychology major at the local community college, but also loved painting. She was insecure and underestimated herself constantly, but never backed down from a challenge. She knew what she liked and wasnt afraid to make it known, but was always willing to try new things, even if they were far, far outside of her typical comfort zone.

But most of all, she was passionate, and compassionate. She showed just as much interest in me as I did in her, mostly curious what it was I saw in her that everyone else in the world seemed to overlook.

I took a big leap, and told her about how my view of the world had changed, how I could now see the core of every living thing I encountered, and not much else. 

I told her that the sight of her had lit up my pathetic little life more than anything else ever had, or even could, and that I didnt know if Id be able to leave her side that weekend if I knew I could never go back.

She cried with joy.

<TEXT> Let's see... An asshole is generally rude or obnoxious to most people in his path, knows it full well, and wouldn't change it. A douche tends to act similar to that, but tends to be genuinely unaware that there might be something unsavory about his/her behavior.

Dicks and tools follow about the same definitions as above, but they're more targeted. 

Examples: An asshole wears the opposing team's colors on the home team's side to piss off the fans. A douche does the same, but only because they got better seats on that side. A dick, when confronted about this behavior, will use sarcasm or general bigotry to try and belittle the person who approached him, and a tool will render a self-serving bullshit apology, but do nothing further about the situation . </TEXT>

<TEXT> ****POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW****
Though I'll try to keep it clean.

Recently played through the entire trilogy for the first time, as Male Shepard, hedging toward Paragon, pursuing the Tali romance.

Based on that sentence alone, you should be able to infer that there are many different ways to experience the Mass Effect universe through the games. I tried not to put in anything plot related, but there are so many choices you can make that effect later points in the story that you could play through a half dozen times, changing your decisions every time, and still not experience everything the game has to offer.

You can save someone in the first game, who returns in the third with advice or assistance. Or, you can kill them, gain an immediate reward, and never experience that interaction.

You can choose save all sentient life in the galaxy from certain destruction, or doom them to that same fate.

You can help a wandering species return to their home planet, or change the very nature of a hostile robotic army so that they'll help your cause.

If you're REALLY good, you can do both. 

(I did)

You can choose to  cure a species-wide genetic disease that stops a warmongering species from breeding - losing a good friend in the process - or lie to said species about doing so, gaining their trust and assistance under false pretenses and ensuring their eventual doom.

These are just a few of the experiences that youtube videos can't adequately reflect. You watch someone else's playthrough of the game, and you can't ensure continuity. The decisions from one video won't necessarily reflect on another. On top of that, you don't get the satisfaction of knowing that your decisions made these things happen. You won't struggle with the morality of your choices, or the long-term effects of your decisions. Who lives, and who dies, would - to you - be no more important than the lives of the characters on a TV show, and you'd have just as much control.

In short, Mass Effect is an experience that you will only adequately understand if you play it through yourself. You wouldn't have someone else read your favorite book to you, you wouldn't want someone else to raise your child and only tell you about the highlights. You'd want to experience all of it first-hand - the hysterical highs, the dark, depressing lows, and everything in between. 

Play. The. Game. </TEXT>

By which I mean, if you really want to marry him, why don't *you* propose, instead of waiting for him to do so. 

In other words, don't say "when the hell are you going to propose," or anything like that. Just do it yourself. "Will you marry me" sounds so much nicer, anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A friend of a friend came to my house a few times. Generally a great guy, fun to be around and had a great sense of humor. So one day, my friend brought this guy over and we had a fun night, drinking a bit and playing apples to apples. The guy has a little too much, and starts hitting on my friend, much to her discomfort. So, I take him outside, and we talk for a while as I wait for him to sober up some. 

Fast forward half an hour, to when the guy announces that he trusts me enough to tell me about the worst things he'd ever done. I think, this'll be something commonplace, like theft, or carjacking, or hiding your sister's birth control and a few months later finding out you're gonna be an uncle.

Nope.

Guy proceeds to tell me that he's killed two of his friends. Then he goes into great detail about how he was bored and stoned for the second one, and just broke the guy's neck and proceeded to copulate with his eye socket, just because he wanted to know how it felt. Never got caught.

I'm thinking, what the fuck? I've got a family here, and I let him into my house?!

Couldn't react that way, though, the guy was obviously seeking redemption or something like that. I told him nice things to placate him, and gently sent him home later. Never invited him over again. </TEXT>

Or, you can just leave the field blank, on an electronic or written application. What most people don't realize is that companies who ask that sort of question to you or your previous employers actually set themselves up for either a slander or discrimination lawsuit if they decide not to hire you. Honesty only goes so far, man, and sometimes you have to decide how much of the truth they need to hear.

NEVER admit to having a poor attitude. NEVER badmouth previous employers. Those are the only things I can identify that you did wrong. Always be as positive as you can - nobody wants to hire anyone who presents themselves poorly. </TEXT>

Or, does the ship require a living person to pilot it to successfully leave the atmosphere? 

Am I, perhaps, piloting a barge, with a separate, detachable storage container which houses the Zeds? 

Does it matter if they reach the moon, or can they just be jettisoned into space?

Would it perhaps be better to release them into orbit, so that they can all be incinerated upon re-entry?

Am I going to be the only person on the ship? And if so, what will my role be? Security? Pilot? Engineer?

<TEXT> Here's how it worked for me...

I started with a person. I thought, something needs to happen to this person. But what? What's interesting? What story would be fun to watch unfold under my pen?

Well, who is this person? Man, or woman? Man, easier, since I'm male. I can write that perspective. What's his background? What's his motivation? Was he rich, or poor? Poor is more interesting, but let's go even further. Very poor, and young, not quite an adult, but has to work to help his family. His dad's worthless, and his mom's sick, so it falls on him.

Catalyst? Something has to drive him forward, a loss of some sort... his mother. Damn, that's dark, but that's the only thing I can see to push it forward. But it can't stick, I don't like that... what if his quest is to get his mother back? Revive her, somehow, or perhaps she was never dead in the first place? How does that go? Who can help him? In what way can this new person guide my hero on his quest? What comes next?

And so on, and so forth...

My world evolved from one thought, which I carried on asking questions about until I worked out the basic skeleton of the story. Once I'd narrowed it down to the absolute basics of the path my story will take, I started working on the details - secondary characters, support characters, their motivations and roles in shaping the story. After that, I worked on locations - where they're going, when, the history of said places, and features unique to these locations which could influence how the story goes forward. How did each location relate to any other location to be used? What other characters or events might happen to push the story forward as a result?

So, I worked out the basic path, the basic character interactions, some more advanced, plot-related character relationships, important locations, and the most essential locations necessary for key story elements. I wrote all of these things out in their own document before I even attempted an actual scene write, and each specific item was about six pages of reference material for when I got going.  All in all, it looks like it's going to be at least three novels worth of material, of which I've written the first two to completion, and rewritten all of the first and a good portion of the second already.

I had tried just sitting and writing with a vague plan before, and failed miserably. I got about sixty pages down, and then lost track of the story, despite my best intentions. Giving myself this fully-considered track to follow has encouraged the realization of my greatest feat of writing yet.  And I'm still improving, still moving forward.

Don't quit. Don't panic. Try really hard not to get lost.

And don't worry too much about number of words or pages. It'll be whatever it becomes. </TEXT>

Helps me isolate separate thoughts, and track my own worries. Sometimes, things pop up in there that I'd never considered consciously before, but are oh-so-obvious once I typed them out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Distractions work, too. Mindless games or involved books are my go-to's.

If you're really struggling with something there's something else that you could try. It sounds kinda strange, though... Write down your though process, as though "talking" to yourself. I find that putting all my thoughts in front of me as they occur helps keep me from cycling endlessly through them, and lets me analyze all the points a little bit better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last time I tried this game, it was too slow and unclear for my liking. I lost interest almost immediately.

Now, there's a sense of strategy, of progression, that makes it feel more involved and rewarding than any other incremental style game I've played before. It honestly feels like a text based RTS-style game. Strange thing is, though, that I hate RTS games.

I love this game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, get the right shoes for your feet. 

There are many specialty stores that offer a free professional gait analysis for customers. Basically, you walk in, they ask you how you're going to be using your new shoes, and then they'll ask to watch you walk for a minute. Based on your answers and how your feet land in your stride, they'll recommend a shoe type for you - either stability, motion control, or minimalist, and maybe a couple other types I don't recall or know of. Best part is, you don't even have to buy the shoes there - you can go home and hunt down the type you need on the internet. From personal experience, Brooks is high quality and fairly affordable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wrote this before in r/rants, but it seems to fit here, too.

I'm 27, and this year was my first good birthday in roughly a decade. Here's more or less a chronicle of the bad ones.

Year 1: Left home alone on rainy day by parents despite my plans to go to a movie with girlfriend of the time, assigned to wait for a plumber to come fix the house, sometime between 10 AM and 6 PM. Plumber never showed, and the roads flooded between me and the theatre, so I missed the date.

Year 2: While on the phone talking to family about abusive roommate (who I was going to flee) got t-boned (before cell phone laws). Lost my car, but uninjured. Was removed from my apartment, given lack of transportation. Could be worse.

Year 3: Air Force basic training. 21st birthday. Did not go well when the TI found out. What's worse, it was week 2 of 8, so I had that long to go before I could have my first drink (I was a good boy, actually waited.)

Year 4: Was in 2-week Combat Skills training course. Had left then-wife $300 emergency money while I was in there, which she decided to use to take our only car up to Illinois. So, not only was I trapped in the training grounds when we were given free pass to leave, I also had to send her more money ($100) to make the trip back. Somehow, she ran out of money/gas halfway back, slept in a truck stop, and "begged" a random stranger for gas money. I put that in quotes because we're divorced now, and I now have suspicions over past activities.

Year 5: Antidepressants. Don't remember much, but this is the year my divorce started. Was removed from my house on base around the time of my birthday (she spread lies, the military had to act). Spent 1.5 months without any contact with my daughter. Plus side, managed to recover from my situational depression enough to get off the meds, so... yay.

Year 6: Divorce settled, have joint custody. Ex-wife decided to withhold my daughter from me for three months without an explanation. I found out when I went to pick her up from daycare (week or two before my birthday) and she wasn't there. Staff said the mother had told them I wasn't to be allowed near my daughter. I called to ask why, and ex-wife called the cops on me. Never got an explanation, but was later accused in court of sexually assaulting my two year old daughter. WTF.

Year 7: Final custody hearing was actually ON my birthday. Other than the drama surrounding it, it all went well; I won full and sole custody of my daughter. What with the timing, however, I can say for certain that the birthday was particularly shitty, especially since crazy ex and her psycho dad (who had threatened me several times, and was actively trying to end my career) were still in the area and knew where I lived.

Year 8: More or less fine, except my new wife had a miscarriage. We'd planned it, wanted it, got it, lost it. All in roughly a month. Have had no luck since.

Year 9. This year. Stayed in the house. Locked the doors. Had some whiskey. Watched movies. Ate cake. Made every possible attempt to not allow fate to ruin the day or the days surrounding it. Worked pretty well, this time around.


So.

 Be thankful for what small blessings you have on any given day, because as you progress through life the only thing you can really be certain of is that things will only ever get harder. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Christian pastor, at the viewing, goes up to speak in front of grieving Catholic family members. Ends up preaching his faith in lieu of a eulogy, pretty much ignoring the deceased completely, and getting what little he actually said wrong.

He did it again at the cemetery, too. </TEXT>

Not sure it really matters, given the nature of this community. Still, some people might ask questions.

*That might make things a little awkward*

If it gets too awkward, just don't respond to them. Never feed trolls, and all that.

What's worse, I was besieged by memories of the first funeral all during the second. Same relative-status, same funeral home, same room, same carpet, same route to the same cemetery, and a very similar service at the very same pavilion. The only difference this time was that some asshole pastor decided to give a sermon instead of a eulogy. 

It wasn't even an appropriate sermon. It was targeted to convert the catholic crowd to Christianity, and didn't even remotely suit the circumstance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I might take a stab at it, the advice here is that an overwhelming majority of people seem to believe that people have to have an actual external reason or justification to become depressed. While that is broadly true, for people who suffer from chronic depression due to a naturally occurring chemical imbalance in their brain, there is rarely if ever an actual tangible reason for depression to strike. When the balance shifts, their depression sets in, and that's all the reason to be had.

To put it in simpler terms, they're depressed because their body is not producing enough of a specific chemical to keep them balanced. To simplify even further, they're depressed because they're depressed. It wasn't triggered, it just happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dying is easy. Anyone can do it at literally any time.

Living, though... Pushing oneself beyond your own preconceived limits of sorrow, joy, fear, anticipation, rage, and control, over and over again in a never-ending cycle of ups and downs; constantly reacting and adapting to a world in flux; pulling off what might seem impossible just in the nick of time, or failing spectacularly; seeing a light in someone else's eyes to show you made a difference, hearing a laugh or a sob that you know you caused. Any number of an infinitely varied and unpredictable conglomeration of stimuli, reactions, emotions, and outcomes, absolutely NONE of which would ever occur if you weren't there as a catalyst.

Death is easy.

Life is beautiful in it's complexity. Difficult, yes. But beautiful. </TEXT>

Imagine that you're standing against one of the walls in that room. You're only a few feet from everything that makes you you. You can step forward anytime, reach out, and make full use of any aspect of your glorious you-ness.

That's sort of like normal, metaphorically speaking.

Now, imagine the same scenario, only your arms and legs have gone numb. You've slid down the wall, and you know full well that you're stuck there. That pile of magnificent you-ness is just out of reach, but you can see all of it. You can't touch it, though, can't get a single bit of yourself back from where you know it has always been. Worse still, you know that you won't be able to until the numbness fades... and there's no knowing when that might happen.

You exist, but you're not you. And you know it. And that just makes it worse, because you desperately want it - not to be you again, but rather, to to be able to muster the strength of will to even care enough to miss it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Found my wife on that site. I know several others who have, as well, and a number more in happy relationships started from that one website.

The problem that most people have with free dating sites such as this is the thought that "you get what you pay for," when, in fact, that's just not true. Any dating site is only as good as its user base. Granted, free means more people might use it who you might deem "undesirable," but even if you paid for eHarmony or something, you'd still have to sift through dozens and hundreds of profiles before finding someone worthwhile.

My own thought on the matter was this: *do I really want to* pay *for love?*

I did not. It worked for me, so hopefully it'll work for you, too. </TEXT>

Essentially, I'm quiet around new people until I can recognize how they respond to some basic interactions. Then, I speak when I have something relevant to say, presenting myself as someone worth listening to. Finally, after a day or two, I have developed a rapport with the person, and can almost act normally around them. I still have to make a conscious effort to involve myself in interactions, but if I get awkward, I still have that basic foundation of credibility to keep me clear of  the "weirdo" classification. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oreo truffles.

Super simple, too. Take 1 package Double Stuff Oreos, 8 oz. cream cheese, and blend together  into paste. Form into 1-inch balls and put them in the freezer to set for 20 minutes or so. Next, melt white chocolate (almond bark or similar, won't melt at room temp) and dip the balls in with a fork or something. Let set in the fridge, enjoy at your leisure.

They. Are. Amazing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dead people. 

In movies, they always look exactly like they did when they were alive, only slightly paler. In reality, though, dead people are almost instantly transformed when their heart stops.

Every muscle relaxes. Various bodily fluids, which were kept evenly distributed throughout the body by the living pulse, immediately start flowing to the lowest point of the body. This makes the face and other elevated areas wither, the skin hanging in loose, unnatural folds; meanwhile, the lower extremities swell and stretch from the settling fluids, expanding and distending like a skin balloon. 

You don't understand the term glassy-eyed until you see eyes that are still wet and reflective, but are perfectly stationary. Living eyes are constantly moving, so that glass-like stillness is particularly unsettling.

You don't understand what is meant by "waxy skin" until you see the shine of a person's bodily oils as they grow cold, solidifying like grease on an oven tray.

You can get to their side in as little as 15 minutes, and they've already undergone this transformation. Source: just recently had all of this burned into my mind, and I got there 15 minutes too late. </TEXT>

The more I talk about this, the more details I recall. It started as an attempted four-way to help a couple of shy friends get with each other. I hadn't gotten any since two months before my daughter was born, some eight months prior. I saw an opportunity, and took it.

Wife ended up with other guy, I ended up with other girl. Neither of us were bothered that it had gone that way, until I realized that I'd basically been shunted aside so she could screw someone else. I realized that the relationship I thought I had was a lie, and called it off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure it could be well done, given today's cinematic standards, and I feel it's been long enough for someone to try and capture the book's more potent moments, either by making the movie longer, or by splitting it like so many filmmakers seem to do these days 

That said, if I actually hear about a remake happening, I will likely cringe with fear. The only person I might trust directing would be - maybe - Joss Whedon.

<TEXT> I have a scene in the book I'm working on, in which the lead character has to talk to the city's lead mechanic to join the races. In the first draft, I had the mechanic offer up a junker vehicle, which promptly fell apart when our lead touches it. I thought it was amusing at the time, but it just felt wrong when I hit that point in the rewrite. So now it's gone; instead, the hero goes introspective while the mechanic works out a deal with a third party. 

...reading that back, I realize I've got to learn to summarize better. It reads better than this sounds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point of life is to live it. My philosophy boils down to two words: Be. Enjoy.

Be the best you that you can be. Make yourself proud of you, in whatever small way you can. Be conscious, always, of what you REALLY need to be happy, and go after it - even if it's not what the world around you says it should be. You are gloriously unique, and no one else can tell you what that means.

Enjoy yourself to the best of your ability. Even in the most trying times, there will always be one thing that brings a smile to your face, or a smirk, or bemused sigh. Hold on to anything that brings you joy with a fierce grip, and if that's somehow gets torn away from you, don't mourn. Get your smile back. There's always something. If you can't find anything to enjoy, you're surely not doing something worthwhile.

Be. Enjoy.

But, above all else, *don't quit.* </TEXT>

Or maybe  6 years ago, when I turned 21 in my second week of basic training? Or perhaps when I was trapped in a military field training center for two weeks straight while my then-wife visited her dad five states away using the money I left her for emergencies, five years ago? Maybe four years ago, when I was in such a fog of antidepressants that I could barely function? Or, three years ago, when the woman I was divorcing refused to allow me to see my daughter for three months straight, centered more or less around that day? Perhaps two years ago, when I spent the entirety of the day sitting in a courtroom stressing over the final results of the custody hearing and the inevitable fallout regardless of the verdict (I won, fyi). And let's not forget last year, when I was locked in another training course that had me too busy to notice, and then my new wife miscarried the day after.

This year was pretty cool, though. Calm, quiet, boring. Wonderful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Suddenly, the banana leaps out of its peel, hurling it to the ground at my feet! It catches me mid-stride with perfect aim, and before I realize what's happening, I'm on my ass.

I stare in bewilderment as the pale fruit innards lands on the sidewalk, sprouting spindly arms and legs at the last instant. It hits with surprising grace, and I realize it's grown a face as well. It glares at me for a moment before drawing up to its full height (meanwhile providing me a good reference point for nearby objects).

"Hello," it snarls at me. "My name it Chiquita Banana. You ate my brother. Prepare to die!"

It leaps into the air with a battle cry that shakes me too my core, and I instinctively throw my right arm up in defense. My timing is off, and I feel a wet impact on my palm. A moment passes, and nothing happens.

I look around, and spot the banana lying in the grass, half smooshed and split in two. I breathe a sigh of relief as I wipe the pulp off of my palm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A week or so after new years day, I found an unused smoke bomb on the ground while waiting for the bus. I pocketed it for later, thinking nothing about it. Around lunchtime, I happened upon it in my pocket while digging for my lunch money. Didn't show anyone, but my friend noticed and asked me about it. I explained that I found it that morning, and wanted to use it when I got home, and the conversation moved on.

Half an hour after lunch, I was called to the principal's office. Apparently, someone had overheard me say that I had a smoke "bomb that I'm going to set off later," and reported me. When I revealed the tiny little firework to the principal, he looked at me with a pitying expression. I only got one day for that, but it was by far the dumbest reason for detention I ever had. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to work at a dairy queen. When I was brought into the kitchen for the first time, they ran me through the process of food prep for the day. Everything was fine until they placed a five-pound lump of ground beef into a metal bowl, filled it with water, and placed it on the stove. I asked what they were doing, and they explained that this was how they made their tacos. They leave the waterlogged meat on the stove for hours, not even completely covered, and basically boil it. Then they drain it, add a spice packet, and set it out on the line.

Exposed raw meat, sitting for hours just above water that never reaches a bacteria killing temperature. 

I couldn't serve that in good conscience, so when they weren't looking, I dumped the meat onto the stove and cooked it up properly. Took all of ten minutes. No one else ever cooked it that way, though, so to this day I won't order DQ tacos.

Of course, it might have just been done that way at this particular location. Also, it's been about six years, so maybe it's improved...but I still wouldn't risk it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was walking on the track around the football field at school, talking to some friends, when I suddenly had an image flash across my mind in vivid detail. It was an eyeball, outside of the socket. The iris was amber, with a starburst pattern and gold flecks. It was stitched up across one side with thin, translucent grey thread. It swelled briefly and then ruptured, starting at the stitches, and then exploding across the iris, which shredded like cotton fibers being drawn apart. Milky fluid spurted out, followed by a flow of red, yellow, and green chunks.

Then I blinked, and the image was gone. It took less than a second, but the details imprinted on my mind. I don't know where it came from, and don't know what it meant. I've never had a repeat occurrence, but it was so surprising that I have never forgotten it. </TEXT>

Locked his own species in an endless cycle of war and death, stole a magic time box, traverses time and space either causing genocide or destruction. Regularly upsets the status quo, provoking revolutions and violence. Kidnaps innocent people with promises of adventure, often throwing them into life threatening situations which they may or may not survive. Destroyed the universe - rebooted it so no one knew  - destroyed time - it got better - and worst of all, only cares about the consequences if they directly, immediately, and negatively affects someone he personally knows.

All in all, though, I love him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I understand where you're coming from (to a limited degree), I also feel that there is very little reason to complain about a situation or difficulty you decide to impose on yourself. If the barrier between you and your goals or desires came from a self-decided imposition or discrimination, then you've no foot to stand on - at least, by my reckoning.

This is how I feel whenever I see things that start with some form of "I want to, but..." The choice you make is yours. Either accept your own decision, or consider the fact that it might be worth revisiting, if it bothers you.

That said (and sorry if it sounded rude or inflammatory, not my intent), there are other options for you to experience the game in some way; however, most of these ring hollow when you lay them beside the actual gameplay experience. It's sort of like watching baseball/football/sports on TV when you could be a part of the action yourself, if only you weren't so lazy/afraid of pain/afraid you'd like it/reasons.

Okay, rant aside...

**TL/DR:** In gaming, as in analog life, there are certain things you will never experience if you don't step outside your comfort zone. Some are worth it, some aren't; but you'll never know what's what until you try. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been following this game since its infancy, and was one of the first to make my purchase when the stores opened (back when Wollay first launched it and nobody could log in). I played it with glee for several weeks before becoming bored, but I still felt I got my money's worth. This, by the way, in spite of the fact that I only played solo. It was a unique experience, albeit with a bit of a learning curve to it, and undoubtedly the most polished alpha game I've yet played.

Fast forward to last week. My daughter has gotten old enough that she wants to play games with me - by which she means, watch while I do everything for her. Cube world has shiny cartoony graphics, so I fired it up. After she spent ten minutes directing me on the character creation, I got to play a different class than I had before - warrior instead of mage. I had to completely rethink my approach and strategy, and all the while my little girl is watching with glee that I can't get from her with Minecraft or Trove or, hell, even Mario. 

TL/DR: Cube world is still fresh from a different approach, and my child enjoys playing it with me better than any other well-funded, big name, or franchised game out there.

TL/DR v2: Quality over quantity, anyday. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd like to help if I can. Can you describe the problem a little clearer? Are there particular files you cannot find, or are you missing the entire cubeworld directory?

If the directory itself is missing, the only troubleshooting step I know is this: have you already run the launcher for the first time, and let it install fully? This may seem like a stupid question, but I'm pretty sure that this game works that way; just downloading the launcher isn't enough.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the reason why a former coworker was late, as he explained it to our boss. I will interject my observations, as I was present for the events he describes.

"I got a speeding ticket, it was bullshit."

First part true, second part not.

"He said I was going sixty in a fo'ty-five, but I tol' 'im my dash said fitty, so he dropped it to fitty-five"

Written in the same manner as he spoke. I was driving behind him, and witnessed the whole event; he was going *at least* sixty. I watched the cop turn around from heading the other direction to stop this guy.

"He singled me out because I'm black."

Two problems: first, his windows were tinted almost, if not actually, illegally dark. Like, 90% tinting. No way to tell he was black, if you don't stereotype based on the car's decorations. Second: the cop was black. I politely pointed that out to the guy.

"Yeah, but if I was white, you know he wouldn't have stopped me."

...cute.

"I tol' 'im, I ain't seen no speed limit sign, it was knocked over"

The cop had started to turn around to chase him down 50 yards past the speed limit sign.

"It ain't my fault, man."

Yeah. Totally.

What's worse, when this guy went in front of the judge later about the ticket (two months late for his court date, mind), he went in his military uniform and said "I don't really want to pay for this ticket." His own description of events, mind. The kicker? The judge let him off.

What. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The world is an exciting and unpredictable thing, full of interesting people and events which, by and large, go completely undocumented. There are people in this world who have a story to tell, but for some reason or another are unable to tell it themselves. That's where I come in. There's nothing special about me. I'm not rich, or privileged, or even that good looking. I've always been good at blending into a crowd, and I like it that way. My name doesn't matter, because the tales I tell are not about me. They are about those people I see while wandering through this life, people whose stories deserve to be told. However, if you must have a name for me, you can call me the narrator, the storyteller, or perhaps even simply the Watcher.

This is the story of Helen. She wasn't my friend. We'd never even spoken, in fact. The only reason I know her name at all is because I overheard it the night I noticed her. 

I spend a lot of time in my local bar these days, sipping on the same glass of poison from when I arrive to when I leave. There's no point in getting drunk to me, because if I do I lose track of the world and the faces around me. I've always been more of a people watcher than a people person, so I like to keep lucid and loose. What better place can there be to find a good story than where people go to let themselves out, the place where they peel the plastic veneer off of their faces and reveal who they truly are inside - and what demons are haunting them.

I'm not certain, really, what drew my attention to Helen in the first place. She wasn't anything like ugly, though certainly she'd never brighten a room with her smile. Average height, average build, brown hair in a style that, at the limits of my imagination, I can only describe as normal. She wasn't dressed to impress, didn't order fancy drinks. She was the sort of person who only went out of her way to not stand out, and perhaps that's what drew my attention. 

She appeared to my eyes at the bar, with the sort of expression you'd normally find on the spiritually troubled - as though her world had recently been turned upside-down and she was finding it hard to reconcile her troubles with God - if, in fact, she even believed in God. Perhaps she was just struggling to reconcile with herself.  It wasn't terribly hard to imagine, in this cruel world, that someone as plain as her might get overlooked regularly - accidentally forgotten, casually ignored.

She started the night with a straight shot of whiskey - a hard bite to dull the apparent pain in her heart. She downed a second, got the third mixed with cola on ice, and went to sip it at an empty table near me, facing away.

I noticed her straight elbow-length hair had a dent in the middle, which made me think she usually wore it up. Tonight, however, it was down and hanging free  a bit unkempt, even. Something had probably changed recently to make her break the trend. Maybe she no longer felt a need to maintain her appearance? If so, then why? My curiosity was piqued.

As I sipped on my drink, I saw her pull out her cell phone and start flipping through old pictures. Her back was to me, so I could clearly see the faces on all of them. There was a common one, a handsome fellow who shared almost all of his shots with her. His effect on her was unmistakable, because in each shot she wore such an unbelievably vibrant smile that her unimpressive face was transformed, beaming with a joy so pure as to bring awe to the heart of the most callous person.

Helen took a drink, and something splattered on the screen. I thought perhaps she spilled from her glass, but then she turned her head to wipe a tear from her cheek. I was beginning to get a picture here, a sense of her story. The man in the picture was loved, very much, and she lost him somehow. This was the source of her sorrow, the reason she appeared before me this evening in pursuit of mind numbing poisons - a feeble attempt to overwhelm her sorrow with a worthless mindlessness.

She sat there for some time, thumbing through the pictures beneath silent sobs and an ever increasing haze on her thoughts. Eventually, through some combination of nerve and alcohol, she started to delete the memories from her phone, destroying what I imagined to be the last link to her past with that man. When she finished, she carelessly tossed her phone across the table and downed the rest of her drink in one swig. She motioned to the bartender for another, then slumped over the table, shaking with silent sobs.

I had to wonder what had happened. How long ago had she lost this man, who she clearly loved so much? What had happened to him, and did he know how much she cared?

Her drink sat unnoticed for almost ten minutes before she pulled her head off the table. She took a quick sip, then gripped the glass with both hands on the table in front of her, head bobbing slightly to the music. I could tell that the liquor had taken its toll, that she was beyond caring what else there was in the world. To her, there was nothing but the thoughts in her head, which had become just foggy enough for her to bear.

Then he came in. The man from the pictures. At last I knew, the reason for Helen's sorrow. He walked in, every bit as handsome as he was in the pictures, and there on his arm, coming barely up to his shoulder, was a handsome young woman, with brown hair, an average build, not unpleasant features, and a quite youthful face that looked too much like Helen to be a coincidence. Here it was - this man had ended up either cheating on her, or dumping her for her relative - younger sister perhaps. 

None of them saw each other for the first few minutes. The man and young woman sat two tables away from Helen, oblivious to her presence as they downed their first round of drinks. It wasn't until the man said something that made the young woman laugh loudly that Helen jerked herself out of her stupor. I was still sitting behind her, so I couldn't see her face, but by her body language, she'd just adopted a most malevolent expression.

She downed what was left of her drink in one go, then rose unsteadily from her seat. I watched, transfixed with morbid curiosity, as she half stumbled toward the couple, toward the man who had wronged her so absolutely. She knocked a chair over as she approached, drawing the man's attention. His smile melted quickly at the sight of her.

"Helen?" he uttered, clearly surprised. "What are you doing here?"

She stood still for a moment, swaying slightly under the influence of the poison in her veins. Then, with a terrible crash, she shattered her empty glass across his temple.

The man dropped. The woman screamed. Helen shrieked, a terrible sound, filled with anguish, loathing, and a most terrible sorrow. The other patrons went silent at her cry, frozen in shock as the man slumped over to the floor, and a pool of blood slowly spread out from the wounds on the side of his head.

Before anyone could react, Helen stormed out of the bar. At that moment, the song on the jukebox ended, and there was a terrible, strained silence as everyone remaining struggled to come to terms with what they had just seen. Then, the young woman - Helen's sister, perhaps - screamed again. 

"Somebody call an ambulance!"

It didn't take long for things to get moving then. The bartender made the call, some other patron came up and bandaged the man's head, and the rest of us were ushered out for the night in short order. I at least had time to finish my drink, but no other stories presented themselves to me that night. 

As for Helen... well, as unfortunate as it is, this is the very reason I decided to share her story. The very next morning, as I read my newspaper, I came across a story of an unknown woman who had leapt in front of a moving eighteen wheeler in the early morning hours. The driver slammed on the brakes, which had made the trailer swing around and park itself inside of a nearby coffee shop. The woman had died instantly. Under the headline, there was a picture of the ambulance workers moving the woman on a stretcher, and I recognized the sleeve of Helen's blouse just barely visible from under the sheet.

Helen lost her dearest love to one of the other people she loved the most, and this caused her such sorrow that it cost her the last thing she should have held dear - her own life.

You should know that I share the stories I see not based on sorrow or pain, but on merit. Helen's story needed to be told, so that she might live on in your minds and hearts.

<TEXT> It is a series of novels, about 15 books long right now, with the next one coming out in may. It's also a TV show, only aired for one season in 2010, though. Definitely worth your time, but I'll warn you now: if you don't like the pacing of the first few books, it picks up significantly after the 4th/5th novels. That's about when Jim Butcher (the author) got established enough to risk writing in his own style - which I think is significantly better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Dresden Files series has a lot of breaks like this, and I love 'em all. I wish I could think of any to quote specifically, but they always get me laughing.

There's one part where Dresden does something that gets pointed out as pretty stupid, and he "turns" to the reader and says "What? It's been a long day, and I'm not making great decisions after all that. I'd like to see you do better in this situation."

Or, you know, something like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Former WalMart employee here.

I was the cart wrangler for a WalMart in San Antonio. Not "a" cart wrangler, mind. "The" cart wrangler. The only other person hired to do my job was mentally challenged, and never actually did anything on his shift. I know, because I had to clean up his mess, and got heat from management when I tried to get the man to actually work.

Aside from that, though, my biggest complaint about WalMart is the cashiers. Everyone - EVERYONE - in the store is cashier trained so that long lines can be taken down as needed. Thing is, they never use people that way. The cashiers are cashiers, everyone else works where they're assigned. 

Although, if you spot a manager and mention this tidbit of knowledge, you'd be surprised just how quickly they'll get another lane or two open. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Generally, from what I've seen, it's the audience's own preconceived notions of how the storytelling should be handled. These days, a video game is usually a cinematic experience in its own right. Because of this, fans of the game (who would make up the core audience of the movie based on said game) go into the film expecting more of the EXACT SAME STORY THEY ALREADY KNOW. When they find that the director took the good story and ran with it in a different direction, they tend to react poorly, feeling personally betrayed that the director allowed such a "travesty" to happen.

This is why I always try to go into any new movie with as few expectations as I can. If you can convince yourself not to expect any specific thing, you'll often be surprised how enjoyable many things can become. For example, I knew nothing of Resident Evil when I first saw the movies. They weren't great movies, but pretty decent shoot-em-ups after the first one. I liked the Super Mario Bros movie, even though it was only vaguely related to the games. 

Hell, I liked World War Z. The book *and* the movie. I just treated them as separate entities, and found a lot of good in both.

I should make a puffin from this post. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not me personally, but it directly affected me when this *sshole broke the bro code.

I met a guy at work who was having some pretty significant troubles. I won't go into detail about what they were, but it was clear that the guy could use a friend. So, I started talking to him, figuring stuff out, giving advice, etc. It seemed to be helping a lot, and so my bosses decided to let me be his "de-facto" supervisor, given that we'd already established a decent rapport. No big deal, nothing really changed. For a while.

See, around that time I was going through a divorce and custody battle. My ex-wife had just split up with the guy she'd been with since I'd filed for divorce, and I made the mistake of asking this other guy to help me pick up my stuff from the pre-divorce house. I didn't think anything of it, really, until a few weeks later.

I noticed the guy seemed extremely conflicted, holding back explainations where he would have shared them before. I couldn't figure out what the problem was, though, so I went to some other coworkers to ask if they knew anything about what was going on.

The guy was dating my ex wife. During a custody battle. And they were engaged.

They got married in less than eight months.

During a custody battle for my three year old daughter.

Yeah. Bro code=shattered.

On the plus side, I won custody. So I've got that going for me. Which is nice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went through this a few years ago. I recall the day I recognized the signs of depression in myself, and that very recognition made everything substantially worse, nuking my motivation and sense of self worth. I somehow managed to get myself to call my supervisor, just said right off "I think I'm depressed, I need to see someone." 

Next morning, I was sitting in a confidential mental health session, left it with a new bottle of antidepressants and a faint gleam of hope I didn't dare look at yet.

Of course, after all that drama, I learned that you can self-refer to mental health with no middle man. At my base, they said if you walk in and say you're experiencing depression symptoms and ask to be seen, they have to get you in as soon as possible, especially on the first visit.

Do what you've got to do, man, but step one is just getting the nerve up to tell someone. I know it doesn't make sense, but you'll be more highly regarded for self-identifying than for toughing it out in silence.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, by self-referring to Mental Health, there are no negative consequences (Air Force, anyway). The only negatives that will happen are if you are referred by Leadership, or if you display significant tendencies toward violence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ICO

8 hours in, came across a puzzle where there was a rope on one side of a gap. I knew I needed to swing across, but I had no idea how to swing on a rope. Tried every button, to no avail. Used copy, so no user manual to help me. 5 minutes of frustration and 20 seconds of googling later, I learned that I needed to hold the circle button to swing. HOLD the damn button. And no in-game tutorial to even give a clue.

Other than that, I made it to the last stage of a shooter once before I realized that I could aim down the sights. Can't recall which one.

<TEXT> I've noticed what I really hope to be a real trend, in which Wollay doesn't post things until he has something to show, and usually that's right before it goes live. Case in point, shortly after he posted that he was making his own site for Cubeworld, said site went live. Within a few weeks of that site appearing, the game itself went live. So, hopefully this is a real trend, and these screenshots/updates mean that the new version will be posting soon.

Fingers crossed! (hopes low.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every other comment I see on here seems a bit jaded, so I'm gonna try for an unbiased answer for you.

If you like exploring for hours on end through any number of endless worlds, following your own ends, then this game will likely be enjoyable for you.

However, it is currently lacking in content and polish. That said, it has many more features than most games that provide access at this point in development. It's fluid, though not without bugs/flaws. It can handily occupy most of your day if you let it, but it is definitely unbalanced no matter how far you progress.

As far as content updates, they are few and far between. It looks like Wollay is averaging 1-2 a year, optimistically speaking. So, if you want something that will grow rapidly, stick with Starbound or Terraria, and come back to this later. 

Just pointing out here, though: Alpha buy in price is normally smaller than finished price. I, for one, saw the promise of the game and threw down the $20 buy in just so I can get the finished version for less - much like I did for minecraft. 

So, there's the facts. Make your choice. I would like to request, though, that if you do decide to buy in, please don't be the guy who grumps about the lack of updates. It's basically one person building the game (Pixxie is really only building the voxel sprites, from what I understand, though I am likely mistaken), so you can't expect much in terms of speed. So far, quality is their aim, and their only failing so far has been communication... though they seem to be getting better about that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Game being developed by many people, using small scale 2-d sprites, where the average world size is many times larger than the actual game files, doesn't take nearly as much effort to create an update as a game being created by 2 people, in a full 3-d environment that must flow naturally. Coding one character, made of blocks, in a 3-d realm takes much more time and effort than coding one character made of several pixels in a 2-d realm. Wollay's also adding a number of different enemies, creatures, and biomes, as well as modifying AI and quest generation. For ONE PERSON, I'm not surprised it takes 20x longer than Starbound's entire workforce.

Perspective. Seriously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pack a lunch. Here's why:

Cost of lunch: $8-$15, depending on where you go. Call it midrange, $10.
5 days a week - $50
52 weeks a year - $2700.
My personal lunch budget runs around $10 a week, times 52 is still approx. $2180 savings

Just over $2 thousand saved by packing a sandwich.

Not to mention gas saved not driving to the restaurant.

EDIT: Quick-math betrayed me, there's 52 weeks to account for, not 48. </TEXT>

I know it sounds contrived, but try to focus on the good, the positive. Start as small as you like and try and look bigger.

A small example, based on your post and starting with the simplest things I see: You woke up (still alive) you're healthy, you have a job. Your family is still there, and it looks like they're going to stay around. You're all healthy. 

There's lots of good to be found in any bad situation, and if you can take a moment when you're overwhelmed to find the good, it can often help you through the worst times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TD/DR Up top: I changed, she didn't.

Married high school sweetheart. She refused to work. Could not hold a job. Couldn't complete anything she began, be it looking for work, getting her GED/diploma (scheduled test once, didn't go 'cause she didn't feel like it, never bothered rescheduling) or even simple household chores (when I moved out in the end, found several shirts on the bottom of the laundry pile I hadn't seen in months, one of which had been missing since before we moved into that house the year prior - that's right, the dirty laundry got so backed up it migrated houses) and would get mad at me when I tried to do housework and pick up the slack because that's "her" job. Selfish, self righteous, incapable of mistakes or being wrong in any capacity whatsoever. Frequent arguments would occur in which we both identify things about the other person that are frustrating/irritating and need to be worked on, and she would make 1 day's effort to display corrective action before reverting. 

Tried for years to make it work. I changed, she didn't. I grew up, she stayed 16. We divorced. And it only got worse from there. </TEXT>

We came back, she was gone, 7 large ashtrays have been left in the house filled with thousands of used cigarettes, dozens of trays of half eaten moldy food (not to mention the dishes) left on virtually every flat surface, and as for what was stolen? XBox, Gamecube, PS2, Dreamcast, VCR, DVD player, at least 50 games from a variety of platforms, half my mom's jewelry collection, two TVs (CRTs, no less), half of our movie collection (at least 100 vhs/dvds) and my dad's car. 

All taken and sold for drug money, except the car. That was found on the side of the road 50 miles away two weeks later.

Fortunately, I got two more levels from the whole ordeal.

<TEXT> Having just completed it on "normal" difficulty, I can tell you that it's not very difficult if you can manage stealth. The game has a very shallow learning curve, so even if you're not used to stealth based games, you should be able to pick it up pretty quick. 
It's also not your standard survival horror game. It's more an adventure game, with zombies. You can, if you want to, kill every enemy you encounter, it will just be very difficult in the earlier stages.
If you give this one a shot, I imagine you'll have a good time, given the games you listed as interesting to you. Try it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I loved this game to death, but have never beaten it, or made it past the third disc, and probably never will. 
I made it to the same point three times, halfway through disc three, and something would always happen so that I could not finish the game. 
First, my memory card malfunctioned - it was one of those with the multiple slots that you select with a button. The buttons stopped working, and my save was lost shortly after starting the third disc.
Second time, the save data corrupted on me for no discernable reason - again on the third disc.
Third time, made it to disc three, no problem - suddenly, farther than I'd ever gotten before by only an hour's gameplay - third disc freakin' cracked in half when I put it into the PS2. 
I'm afraid to download it to my PS3; it'd probably brick the system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All I have to contribute here is that Borderlands doesn't work with the regular wired controller, you have to use a generic one for some reason (Logitech works for me). Even then, when I try to use the gamepad, the forward/backward movement controls are inverted. I'm sure there's a fix out there, but I just found it easier (read: more responsive and accurate) to just get used to the keyboard and mouse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Beginning of the game, when the gate opens, Old Samos looks around and says "so this is how it happened." To me, implies that he is very aware of everything Jak is about to go through - but only from the perspective of Young Samos. 
I don't believe that Young Jak lost his memory after going through the rift gate. Merely that he was too young to remember.
As for Vin's death... it's hard to catch, but shortly after the Metal Heads swarm the city, he pops up on your flying radio thing screaming for help, and then you hear his death cries. But it's difficult to hear it over the battle sounds and the "tension" music that goes with it, so I can see how that wouldn't be clear.

<TEXT> I don't know, I've often rather subscribed to the notion that zombies' bodies (and various parts thereof) would remain animated until they are no longer receiving a signal from the brain. Meaning if you shoot off a hand, it'll just lay there on the ground, but the zed's not fazed at all by it,   keeps on coming. Same if your shot severs the spine - the lower body goes slack, but the upper body can still pull itself toward you. I've always thought it a bit amusing, because following this, if you just sever the head without destroying it, it just sits there gaping, and possibly bites at whatever steps near it. If this were implemented in game, it could perhaps be a trap against players? </TEXT>

Couldn't get the pervs off me. After about 20 minutes of being hounded by Brah's, I asked if they wanted to know what I really looked like, switched back to my male avatar, and sat back and laughed as they blew up, raged out, and stormed off.... all but one guy who thought it was hot   kept flirting. Creepyish.

<TEXT> It's a pointless human experiment. The countdown timer has only decreased about 5 hours so far, despite their best efforts. The only difference they've made is that instead of being released at the time of day they'd normally be leaving work (at least in my time zone), it will be released while they're at work. If this trend continues and they complete all the games, then the game will likely release by the time they have to leave for work. So, one way or the other, they'll have to wait just as long to play it. Suckers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember the days when a heartfelt message intended for a certain special someone was privately sent via snail mail, or even email. Why put it up here for everyone to see? It's obviously meant for one specific person who means the world to you, there's no need to put it up here for everyone to see. It pulls the emotion away from it, it's not special, it's not just for him/her. When you take this message that you painstakingly crafted for the object of your affections, and put it up here for the world (the Reddit portion of it, anyway), it's no longer personal, private, special, or meaningful. It's a Karma trap for saps and lonely people who wish they could feel the same. So, downvote for you, sir/ma'am. Next time, try to make it special. No one else needs to see this, and I guarantee your chosen person will appreciate it more if you make something JUST FOR THEM. Have a wonderful day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, enlisted member here. I went through basic two weeks after I got married, and I can honestly say that I drew my strength almost exclusively from the letters I got from my wife. I undoubtedly would not have made it through the ordeal if not for her showing me how strong she was being while I was gone. I knew that she worried unendingly about my welfare while I was there, especially with all the horror stories floating around the internet that she was finding at the time, but in spite of that she was being brave and making her way through the days productively. We had no children at the time, so she didn't need to do anything other than sit at home and worry and wait for me to finish, but instead she got up, got out of the house, and took care of business. Every day that I got a letter telling me how much she worried about me and my job and our future, and also how much she had done since she last wrote to move toward that future, gave me the strength I needed to move on and get through Basic. So, yes, the spouse at home has a harder time, because they have to stay strong for us. We can break down and come to them in our time of weakness, but if they waver and start to crack, we lose our focus. If they lose faith and leave, we lose our reason to continue the job. They know this and fight with that knowledge every day. And I know I'm not the only one who feels this way, though it definitely varies from couple to couple, person to person, but in this Airman's opinion, the spouse/significant other back home always has the worse time of it. </TEXT>

Basically, move the bumpmaft and patcher files into minecraft.bin, then do this:


3. Double-click the mcpatcher EXE file to run the patcher.
4. Check the box beside "Texture Pack," select 128x128 int he "Tile Size" drop-down box and click the "Browse" button just to the right.
5. Select "bumpmaft.jar."
6. Ensure all of the boxes in the "Options" section are checked, aside from "Custom Portal", which will be greyed out.
7. Click the "Patch" button.
8. When the new window reads "Success!... Probably", close that window and exit from the patcher.

<TEXT> Actually... when you press your fingers together (preparing the snap), you force all the air out from between them. Then, when you suddenly and rapidly slide them apart (performing the snap), your fingers separate so quickly that the air can't fill the space quite fast enough. This means that a tiny vacuum forms between your fingers for a fraction of a second.  The SNAP sound comes from the vibrations caused by air rushing in to fill the vacuum left in the space between your rapidly separating fingers. Basically, it's a mini sonic boom. Try hitting the palm of either hand with your finger, at any speed, and you'll see that you don't get the same, well, SNAP sound; that's because it's just flesh hitting flesh. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That may be so, but to be fair, you should judge your "expected" price by more than just the visual experience. How enjoyable is the gameplay? How engaging is the story? These things, you may agree, can readily counter poor graphics. Take the original Fable, for instance. Engaging gameplay, good story, but all of the characters kinda look like fish. I paid full price. Now compare that to Final Fantasy 13. Absolutely beautiful. Gameplay a 2-year-old monkey could follow. I still paid full price. Wasn't worth it.

Think back over the last decade or so. Can you honestly think of ANY game that didn't release with a $40-$60 price point? Graphics don't have anything to do with it, that's just standard fare. After that, the price is determined solely by supply vs. demand. The more popular it is, the longer it will be expensive. Your argument is invalid </TEXT>
