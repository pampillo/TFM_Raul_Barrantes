Sure, those groups are less likely to have IDs, but that's beside the point. For many, at the most basic level, Voter ID laws make sense and their reasoning is benign. Why wouldn't you want to make sure that the person voting is who they say they are? Like, most billionaires are white, but nobody thinks that laws raising taxes on the wealthy are "targeting white people", that just happens to be the case. They feel the same about Voter ID laws. Sure, poor people and minorities are less likely to have ID, but that's besides the point of the law. </TEXT>

No I did not. If you think that's what I said, I suggest you read my comment again.

<TEXT>  So to put the two thoughts together, a right is something that is immoral for the government to take away yet the right is also not subject to morality. That makes no sense, please explain.

A right is something that's *immoral* for the government to take away. However, the *rights themselves* are not subject to what individual people believe are moral. For example, some people believe that hate speech is immoral. That does not mean that a person's right to free speech should be taken away. </TEXT>

But those *infringe on other rights*. That's the difference. 

literally the only way natural rights are possible is because certain states recognize them. How did you even type this?

What? What are you talking about? Things can still exist without states recognizing them. Your line of reasoning doesn't even make sense. So according to you because Turkey doesn't recognized the Armenian Genocide, it doesn't exist. </TEXT>

There's no tablet somewhere in nature with a list of natural rights you have, the entire concept of human rights, natural rights - those are all human constructs dude, every single one of them.

That's just not accurate. Hence the examples I gave as to if you were the last person on Earth. They exist because they are possible.

Go talk about "natural rights" in Saudi Arabia as a woman and see how far you get, I'm sure the Saudi royal family will get a fantastic laugh. Time travel back to Weimar Germany and talk to Hitler about "natural rights" and tell me how it goes over. Without society there to enforce these rights you believe you have - they do not exist.

That's why those states were/are evil. Because they refuse to recognize natural rights. </TEXT>

Imagine that everybody on earth died, except for you. There are some things you would be able to do. You could build a house. You could bear arms. You could say whatever you wanted. You don't need a government or other people to do these because the government doesn't need to provide them for you, because you are born with them, as they are *natural rights*.

Healthcare needs to be provided for you. Ergo, it is *not a right*.

You haven't actually challenged any points made in the articles I posted. You simply believe that since they're "conservative talking points" that automatically makes them inaccurate.

How is that relevant? I honestly don't see your argument here. Of course it's immoral to force people to house strangers on their own property.

Is it immoral for someone to accumulate $150k of medical debt, get denied further coverage because they can't keep up payments, get denied continued care because they can't afford the cost, frequent the ER when the symptoms are bad enough (taking up space your families emergencies), and then die from a completely curable condition.

<TEXT>  The hilarious part is this person doesn't seem to understand what rights are. There are no innate human rights other than the ones we say exist, and most humans view healthcare as a human right.
 
You have to be joking. Of course we have innate human rights. The people in the earliest civilizations were able to build a home and farm their own land, no?

This is like when conservatives try to claim the only rights you have are the ones listed in the constitution.

Citation needed.

The idea that this is still an argument - we know for a fact single-payer is the best option, we know for a fact that most people view healthcare as a human right, we know for a fact that the current system not only causes us severe economic harm but also causes needless human suffering and these people are still clinging to their delusional worldview that seems to amount to nothing more than pure greed and selfishness. They'd literally rather spend more money for worse outcomes if it means they can prevent someone, somewhere from getting something for nothing.

No offense to you, but this attitude pisses me off. The idea that **MY** way is absolutely true, and anybody against it is simply **IGNORING THE FACTS**! Never mind the *fact* that there are [legitimate](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/851264) arguments [against](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112713/drawbacks-singlepayer-healthcare.asp) single [payer](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-04-30/single-payer-would-make-health-care-worse). No, it's simply because all those people are just **IGNORING THE FACTS**.

Come on, man. Broaden your mind, a bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Growth rates have been lower after Reagan than those before?

on 8 of the 10 key economic variables examined, the American economy performed better during the Reagan years than during the pre- and post-Reagan years. Real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period after experiencing no growth in the pre-Reagan years; it experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency. The only economic variable that was lower during period than in both the pre- and post-Reagan years was the savings rate, which fell rapidly in the 1980s. The productivity rate was higher in the pre-Reagan years but lower in the post-Reagan years.

So you're lying. Even the things that did go down post-Reagan were still better than they were before him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alternet? Really? That's like Breitbart for the left. Well normally I'd stop you there but I need to show you why you're wrong. Fascism has a million definitions. Here's one by [John T. Flynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism#John_T._Flynn) that will show that Trump is actually less fascist than Obama was.

1. Trump is vehemently pro-capitalism. Obama on the other hand, has been one of the [most anti-capitalist Presidents on record](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasdelbeccaro/2013/04/16/barack-obama-the-anti-capital-president/#7d143f815e4d). 

2. Sort of an extension of #1, but Obama has been far more focused on demand management than other recent Presidents. Certainly more so than Trump has.

3. This one goes without saying. Obama added trillions to the deficit. How could we let him get away with such *fascist* ideas? After all, its on the list.

4. Obama escalated bombings and drone strikes to an unprecedented level. He killed American citizens extrajudicially. Pretty fascist of him to do that.

5. ["I'm still not enforcing immigration law, no matter what the court says"](http://nation.foxnews.com/2016/06/23/obama-im-still-not-enforcing-immigration-law-no-matter-what-court-says). Trump has actually enforced laws.

There. By your own standards of checking off boxes on a list, Obama is a fascist and Trump is not. Why don't you try thinking for yourself? </TEXT>

He's done less than half of these. And he's done the direct opposite of some, like #11. 

Compare that to Obama, who did more than half. Or Bush, who did more than half.

If Trump's a fascist then pretty much every President since FDR has been a fascist. </TEXT>

He's the President of the United States. If that's not "taking advantage of it" what is?

Do you have any evidence for that claim?

Face it, trumps a con man

Correct me if I'm wrong but you need to be pretty damn intelligent to be a con man. 

This is why nobody takes these criticisms of Trump seriously. One minute he's an idiot and the next he's an evil calculating mastermind plotting to destroy the United States. One minute he's in Putin's pocket and the next he's about to start WWIII against Russia. There are legit criticisms you can make about Trump.

<TEXT>  I'd like to see a reference for the Dems not enforcing the business provisions under Reagan.

http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/todays-immigration-debate-rooted-reagan-amnesty-experts-say/

Bush 41 made his "read my lips" promise and it's somehow Clinton's problem he won? What Bush said is up there with Obama's "keep your doctor" pledge or "red line " in Syria.

Forgive me if you misunderstood. I didn't claim that it was Clinton's fault. I claimed that Bush made a promise, but then had to compromise on it, and lost badly for it. People don't want compromise.

Gingrich was and still is a firebrand. He shut down the government and it cost home for good reason. His "Contract with America" was a prototype for today's GOP platform. I.e., failed and partisan in equal measure.

Did it cost him? The GOP maintained majorities and got a Republican in the White House 4 years later. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  i don't think you understand just how fucked up it is that democrats get more votes than republicans nearly every election

On you mean like the [2014 senate elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2014)? Or did you mean the [2014 House elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2014)? Or maybe the [2016 House elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2016)? 

Gerrymandering and voter suppression are very real and very dangerous.

Gerrymandering is a nonissue. It's something Democrats use as a scapegoat for their own failures. In 2012, for example, the new districts cost Democrats [7 seats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/02/17/redistricting-didnt-win-republicans-the-house/?utm_term=.dd5e2b7e2719), or 1.6% of the House. Even if we used the former districts, they wouldn't be anywhere close to having a majority. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is with the left. Our current problem with obstruction can all be traced back to the 80s/90s. In 1986, Reagan passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, granting amnesty for about 3 million illegal aliens in exchange for the enforcement of harsh penalties against businesses that hired illegals. The amnesty happened, but Democrats in Congress stripped the enforcement against businesses. So we have Democrats refusing to compromise.

In the early 90s, HW is president. He made a famous campaign pledge to not raise taxes, but he knew that he had to for the good of the nation. So he did. He made a compromise for the nation, but he was crucified for it, and we got Bill Clinton. Once again, the left showed that they cannot act in good faith with compromise.

So in 1994 Gingrich refuses to compromise on anything because why should he? It never worked before. So the GOP gets both houses of Congress. They impeach Clinton and get W in the White House. They oppose the ACA and sweep Congress again. The GOP doesn't compromise because they know that it doesn't work with Democrats.

Basically had the Democrats actually compromised back in the 90s we wouldn't have gotten Gingrich and the start of all this obstructionism. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The argument is they are willing to do work that others aren't.

That is a separate argument. That doesn't change the fact that it is a commonly-held belief that pay below minimum wage helps keep the price of goods low in America, and that is a reason to not deport illegal aliens. Democrats are simultaneously for cheap labor (through illegal aliens) and for a living wage. These beliefs are in direct contradiction with each other. That was my original point.

And just because you lost an argument doesn't mean insulting the other person makes you win. Try to be more civil next time. You're embarrassing yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not moving the goalposts. You are not understanding my argument. It is a common argument among those on the left that illegal immigrants are a necessary part of the workforce because they illegally work for below minimum wage, keeping prices down.

It is also a common cry for the left to have a "living wage" be minimum wage, commonly at $15.00 an hour. This is in direct conflict with that above statement.

It is also common for people on the left to ask for amnesty for illegals. This takes away the entire first argument, as they will need to be paid minimum wage, which again, many want to nearly double.

So, there is blatant hypocrisy from Democrats regarding these points. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok then. Well let's go through it all.

1. Trump-Clinton: Literally nothing has come from this Russia "scandal". They didn't "hack" the election. No voting machines were compromised and they released true information. People made informed choices.

2. Bush-Gore: The Supreme Court didn't "appoint" Bush. Literally no asked-for outcome of the Florida recounts would have made Gore the President. Also don't see what states rights have to do with that...

3. Reagan-Carter: This has been [pretty thoroughly debunked as a conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Surprise_conspiracy_theory), and both houses of Congress (Democrat majority at the time) concluded that there was no evidence. I guess we should be thinking of pizzagate as true to, because that has about the same amount of credibility as this does.

4. Ford was confirmed by Democrat majority houses of Congress and his Presidency was in accordance with the legal line of succession as defined in the 25th Amendment and the Presidential Succession Act. "Illegitimate" my ass.

5. Nixon-Humphrey: Nixon did undermine peace talks, but that doesn't change the fact that Humphrey would have won were it not for millions of racist Democrats voting for George Wallace. 

That entire rant is just a bunch of conspiratorial nonsense and complete ignorance of the laws of the United States. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2018: After the passage of several bills directly targeting California's immigration policies, California elects a very liberal Governor promising an independence ballot proposition should Trump be reelected in 2020.

2020: After several of his policies successfully being enacted, Trump is reelected in another close election against a Booker/Harris ticket, once again losing the popular vote. Trump ramps up many of his policies, and completely cuts off federal funding for California's sanctuary cities. In response, the Governor vows to have an independence referendum by the end of the year.

2021: At Trump's second inauguration, a bomb goes off on the National Mall, killing dozens. Members of the [Yes California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_California) movement claim responsibility. The Governor condemns the attack. Trump is livid and tells the Governor that should the referendum take place he will take action to stop it. The ballot proposition takes place later that year, with "Independence" winning by a wide margin. Both Trump and Congress declare secession to be illegal, with Trump vowing to send the army to stop it from going forward. California's Senators and Congressmen stop attending sessions of Congress in protest.

2022: The Governor is reelected in a landslide and declares that secession shall move forward. Trump sends in the army to stop them. Trump's popularity soars as he vows to "preserve the Union at all costs". Several military bases in California are seized, but most stay loyal to Trump. Hundreds die within several days. Many of California's eastern counties declare their intention to stay in the Union. 

2023: Sacramento is captured, and The Governor asks for peace. Trump refuses, stating that "rebellion will not be forgiven". The Governor and most of the government is killed and Sacramento is burned. Trump sends in more troops to occupy remaining rebellious counties. Americans are horrified at the atrocities committed against "their countrymen" by US troops. by the end of the year a "Reconstruction" period is initiated.

2024: Both party nominees run on a platform of ending federal occupation of California. A moderate Republican is elected and vows that California shall be "welcomed back with open arms".

2026: California formally reenters the Union. In an act of unity, the President and his family visit the new capital, Los Angeles. His wife and daughter are shot and killed by a group of pro-independence terrorists. In response, the President declares a renewed federal occupation to "root out remaining traitors". Many Californians die and video leaks of the President personally killing several captured terrorists.

2028: America is tired of 6 years of conflict and a Democrat is elected with a "just let them have it" stance.

2029: A formal treaty is drawn up with [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Coastal_California_Map.svg/585px-Coastal_California_Map.svg.png) being a now independent California Republic. White counties remain a part of the United States. Texas, under the guise of "a too liberal President", declares its own secession. America, not wanting to get into another prolonged conflict, allows them to leave. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization_of_Egypt), Egypt became majority Muslim by the mid-10th century, about 300 years after the conquest, and today is almost 90% Muslim. But India today is 80% Hindu, despite being ruled by Muslim empires for hundreds of years. What accounts for these differences? </TEXT>

You had Zachary Taylor, a man who had never held elective office, running against not only former Senator, Secretary of State, Secretary of War, Ambassador to France, and House Representative  Lewis Cass, but he was also running against former *President* Martin Van Buren. He was also a Whig when the Democrats had a pretty solid track record of winning. But he still pulled it off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Think of it this way.

Imagine the Patriots are playing say...the Browns. In theory, the Patriots *should* be able to destroy them with almost no effort. They have better players, better coaching, the whole 9 yards. But let's say the Patriots have a bad day. They allow a lot of turnovers and give up a lot of points, but they're still ahead by 2 points late in the 4th quarter. Now let's say a referee made a bad call and it gave the Browns the ball, and they were able to score a field goal to win at the last second. Did the ref make a bad call? Yes. Did that bad call lose the Patriots the game? Yes.

But the point is that the Patriots have NO BUSINESS even allowing it to be that close in the first place. Clinton was only up by 2 late in the 4th quarter before the Comey letter hit. That's on her. </TEXT>

1. Goobacks (2004): Satirizes illegal immigration. By the end of the of the episode, Stan comes to the conclusion that while immigrants are living in poverty and they are just trying to get by, poor societies often hurt other societies instead of helping them.

2. ManBearPig (2006): Satirizes Al Gore and climate change. Pretty much says that climate change is no big deal.

3. Stunning and Brave (2015): Satirizes political correctness and Caitlyn Jenner, and pretty much says that it's all total nonsense.

<TEXT> It's not just about the quality. It's the shoddiness of it all. The MCU was built on the first Iron Man, which is still arguably the best of the films, but even then all but The Incredible Hulk were at least *above average*. They put out a movie for each character, building up to The Avengers, and moving from there.

For the DCEU, there have been so many missteps and false starts that it's hard to not expect failure at this point. *Green Lantern* was the "planned" start all the way in 2011, and that failed. Then Man of Steel was OK, but still divisive. Then when BvS came out they tried to squeeze what the MCU did in several films into one, and it flopped. Then Suicide Squad flopped. Now there are problems with The Batman. It's fair to expect the worst at this point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Originally carved on a wall of the now collapsed Domus Gelotiana in Rome, the Alexamenos graffito depicts a Roman soldier (Alexamenos) raising his hand in a gesture of worship towards a donkey-headed figure on a cross. The Greek text reads "Alexamenos worships his God".

It is taken to be a mocking depiction of Christianity, as Romans of the time mocked Christians for worshiping a man who had been crucified, the most shameful way to die in Rome. The donkey head may also be a reference to the false belief that Jews and Christians worshiped a donkey God.

Interestingly, in a nearby chamber of the Domus Gelotiana, there is another inscription stating "Alexamenos fidelis", or "Alexamenos is faithful", presumably carved by another Christian as a response. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  gene editing, with the rise of technologies like CRISPR

Yeah I definitely see that being a huge issue. Like let's say a mom wants to give her kid blue hair and cat's eyes. Is she allowed to do that? Or what if we find a way to "turn off" homosexuality in a fetus. Should a parent get to choose their child's sexuality, too? Does that violate the rights of the child? I mean women can abort fetuses, so by that same logic it makes sense that they'd be able to customize them. 

Or what if a rich family wanted their children to be built like Greek gods? Obviously poor families would be unable to afford this, so that'll just create a further divide between the upper and lower classes.

I definitely see this being a big issue in the coming decades.

I can do it too. And to be honest I'd trust the 10-year Prime Minster of one of the most powerful countries on earth's opinion on the subject more than a TV comedian's. The most frustrating part is that they don't even realize how stupid they sound treating something that's clearly supposed to be said in jest as an absolute fact. It's sad, really. </TEXT>

Doubtful. Reagan redefined politics in America. He set us on a conservative path that we're still seeing today. Hell, Reagan's influence can still be seen in Obama's self described New Democrat ideology, which arose after Reagan and HW so Democrats could start winning in the new conservative political climate. Reagan won 44 and 49 states and his successor won 40. He turned millions of Democrats into Republicans and grew the GOP. Obama's successor lost to Donald Trump and weakened the party. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obama will be seen as a decent President, but not a great one. The fact that he was the first black president as well as his "coolness" will certainly help his legacy, but from a policy perspective it will be more mixed.

The ACA, his landmark legislation, has widely been regarded as a failure, or at the very least not nearly as successful as it was meant to be, and it is about to be torn to shreds.

Guantanamo Bay is still open.

We still have troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.

He allowed the rise of ISIS.

His "Russian Reset" has been a complete failure and Russia has been rapidly gaining influence throughout his presidency.

Democrats have lost over 900 seats nationwide, including their largest majorities in the House and Senate in decades.

54% of Americans say race relations have worsened under Obama.

He ran on being "the most transparent administration ever" and has gone after whistleblowers and allowed massive expansions in domestic surveillance. 

Armed "moderate" rebels in Syria, many of which ended up in the hands of jihadists.

Libya is a mess.

Ramped up drone warfare to kill American citizens without trial.

But honestly the most telling and biggest part of his legacy will be that under 8 years of his leadership the nation chose Donald Trump over his chosen successor. That will be his legacy. Thanks, Obama.

Of course he has done some good. He killed bin Laden. Opening up to Cuba was a long time coming. But other than that he won't really be remembered for much. Gay marriage, maybe, but that was SCOTUS. Like, nobody credits Nixon for Roe v Wade. The Iran deal maybe but that's yet to be seen if it works out. In short, Obama will be seen as an okay president who handed DJT the keys to the White House. </TEXT>

So because it's Trump it makes that line of thinking okay now? Not a chance.

Now he has had a foreign power and a politically compromised intelligence agency help him gain power against the will of the people.

<TEXT> It's all a matter of branding. "Civil War" implies that the enemy are countrymen. Peoples of the same state in conflict. Palpatine wanted to portray the CIS as "others", and put an emphasis on the military of the Republic (and later Empire), by referring to the war as the Clone Wars. As for the actual Galactic Civil War, you are correct that for the majority of the conflict it was mainly insurgents, but by the time of the Battle of Endor you had major systems in open rebellion. And since the Alliance won, they wanted to create the sense of Galactic unity that Palpatine wanted to suppress, leading to them calling the conflict the Galactic Civil War. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Planned Parenthood

There are many other reproductive health clinics besides PP. Withdrawing federal funds would not be a danger to any Americans. In 2014 10% of the money they received wasn't even used.

The ACA

Repealing the ACA would cause *less* danger to America. Forcing people to buy expensive insurance that they do not need is a danger to our liberty. Companies being forced to fire people or cut hours due to increased costs is a danger to people's ability to make money and provide for themselves and survive.

Social Security

Social Security will almost definitely fail by the time my generation reaches the age to actually benefit. That's assuming they don't raise the retirement age. And again, how is this "dangerous" if its gone? SS isn't intended as a retirement plan.

Medicare/Medicaid

Well nothing is happening to Medicaid so I'm going to assume you put it in there by mistake and you're not an idiot. As for Medicare, one could certainly argue that its existence is a danger to the many younger Americans who are forced to pay into it while receiving no benefits for decades. And the planned voucher system will keep coverage, but people will need to pay a bit more. Wow. So dangerous.

Minimum wage

Raising the minimum wage is dangerous because it will force many small companies out of business, which will cause many people to lose jobs.

Education

Do you think you are significantly smarter than your parents? Like, noticeably smarter? Because unless they're in their early 40s they received at least some of their education without a federal Department of Education. Generations of people were educated just fine without it. So again, you fail to say how this being taken away would be dangerous, let alone the greatest danger.

The EPA

I will give you this one. Environmental policy is becoming a major issue and the United States will need the EPA to ensure that climate change is left in check.

Net Neutrality

Come the fuck on. I'm not even going to address this one. You think ending net neutrality is THE GREATEST DANGER TO AMERICANS? Good think you put this one last or I would have just written you off as a 15-year old with no idea how the world works and not bothered replying.

So, out of those 9, only 1 could *potentially* cause danger to Americans (in the very far future). And you have failed to address how this would be THE GREATEST DANGER TO AMERICANS IN THE WORLD, ahead of terrorism or Russian interests attempting to influence elections. For someone named "TheSmartestMan" you really should do more research before attempting to argue.

<TEXT>  If they had won or if the war had dragged on longer there is a very solid argument to make that things would have gotten much worse.

This is the main failure of your argument. There was never a chance they could have 'won or dragged on longer'. Their entire economy was based on conquest of other nations. They would *eventually* have run out of places to plunder. This is the main difference. The USSR had far more long-lasting horrendous impacts around the world that we see TO THIS DAY. Human rights abuses in China? Caused by the USSR. North Korea? USSR. Cuba? USSR. 

We can argue about a few million people killed by either Nazis or the Soviets but the point still stands that people killed by ALL OF COMMUNISM (which all can be traced back to the USSR) dwarfs those killed by the Nazis in WWII.

To circle back to the original argument, Reagan did not single handle bring down the Soviet Union anyway

Oh yes of course. If that's what you thought I was arguing I apologize. He certainly didn't do it all himself, but its undeniable that his actions significantly hastened the fall. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The civilian casualties due to the Germans exceeded the USSR by several million and over a shorter time span.

Who cares if it was a shorter time span? If the USSR killed more people over a longer time span, wouldn't they be the worse entity?

The Soviet civilian death estimates were widely overblown which was addressed both in my source and by modern historians.

My source proved this incorrect.

they were internal deaths of their own territories by and large.

Does that make it better? Over 100,000,000 people lived in the USSR. Just because they were "in their own territories" doesn't excuse what they did.

But you are still missing the bigger issue. The USSR has had the single worst impact of any state in modern history. It has led to many other communist movements, which by modern estimates, have caused the deaths of near [100,000,000 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism).

You're missing the forest for the trees. It's not *just* about what the USSR did within its borders. Its about the effects of their supporting and propping up other communist regimes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah. I see what you're saying. You're incorrect, but I see why you are.

 Total deaths as a result of WWII (which was caused by the Nazi's) are 60+ million

WWII was not the sole fault of the Nazis. [The Second Sino-Japanese war began a year before Germany even annexed Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War), and is widely considered to be one of the driving forces behind the start of the war, and even a possible start of the war.

The USSR is estimated to have at least [56,000,000 deaths between 1928-1954](http://www.ibtimes.com/how-many-people-did-joseph-stalin-kill-1111789). Subtracting the ~20,000,000 caused by the German invasion, that is still millions more than the ~35,000,000 killed on both sides between the Western and Eastern Fronts in WWII as well as the Holocaust. And that is not even mentioning the many more millions dead in other wars caused or prolonged by the USSR, such as the Chinese Civil War or Vietnam War. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Remember how Biden said to African-Americans Romney was ["going to put you back in chains"](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/vp-biden-says-republicans-are-going-to-put-yall-back-in-chains/)? Or how Romney going out of his way to hire women was [called sexist](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/17/1145818/-A-Binder-Full-of-Gender-Discrimination)? Or how [McCain was called a racist for questioning Obama](http://www.alternet.org/story/102993/backlash%3A_six_challenges_to_mccain's_racist_fearmongering)? 

Neither Romney nor McCain are racists or sexists. They are decent, dignified men who wanted the best for their country. But the Left has been crying wolf for so long that when an *actual racist and sexist* comes along, nobody gives a shit.  </TEXT>

Well just because it goes "counter to a trend" doesn't mean it's a bad idea. Prohibition was with the "progressive trend" and that was a horrible idea. In regards to your second point, does the Senate *need* to be accountable to voters? We already have the House for that. The Senate was designed to represent the interests of the States.

Your second point I admit could be a legitimate issue. </TEXT>

In elections, a majority happens when more than half of the electorate votes for one candidate. For example, if a candidate gets 50.1% of the vote, she gets a majority. A plurality happens when less than half vote for a candidate that wins because the vote is split among more than two candidates. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We should absolutely keep the Electoral College. It allows for far more representation than a popular vote election would. Why would a presidential candidate care about the problems that a farmer in Idaho has, or a cashier in Vermont has, if they only needed to campaign in urban areas? Having the EC means that candidates are required to appeal to voters of a wide variety of ideologies. 

However, I would definitely support adding in a clause of some sort saying that the EC is nullified should a candidate get 50% of the vote and lose the EC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so let's take this election and use the [Two-Round System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system), which is popular around the world. If we take out every 3rd party, Trump still would have beaten Hillary by popular vote count. Adding up Trump/Johnson/McMullin/Castle, all conservative candidates, they have more votes than the liberal Hillary/Stein. </TEXT>

If it cannot survive outside of the womb then a late-term abortion should definitely be an available option should the parents choose to have one. I'm talking about a completely healthy fetus. If there are problems evident, then exceptions should obviously be made. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  What is the definition of "can survive?" Does that mean reaching a gestational age equaling the lowest ever recorded, on the chance that this particular one could also? Does requiring the use of the best medical technology and expertise available count? Even if that bankrupts the mother and family?

If the baby can survive, it should be treated like a normal person would be in regards to this. The earliest viable birth was 21 weeks, 5 days, so as far as we know, that is the earliest point a fetus can be considered a "person" and should be protected (meaning not be able to be aborted).

What if science advances to the point where a fertilized egg can be reliably extracted and grown into a health baby in a lab? Does that mean abortion becomes effectively illegal at any gestational age?

I would hope so. Abortion is a heinous act, and ideally there would be NO abortions, because when you really get down to it it is the ending of (what could be) a human life. Really the only reason we allow it is because we recognize that women have the right to decide what they do with their body, and their rights trump a bundle of cells' (to a point). If a woman's body is able to be taken out of the equation, there is really no reason to allow abortions at all. </TEXT>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Surprise_conspiracy_theory

After twelve years of mixed media attention, both houses of the US Congress held separate inquiries and concluded that the allegations lacked supporting documentation.

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/26/reagan-s-october-surprise.html

The theory has never gained real legitimacy, and it seems that there are still new holes are being found in it.

<TEXT> Yes they were. Let's take a look.

Truman-Pretty good. Saved millions of lives by dropping the bombs. Truman Doctrine was great.

Eisenhower-Best post-WWII.

Kennedy-Died before he could do anything important.

Johnson-Would be a great president were it not for Vietnam.

Nixon-Would be the greatest (China, ending Vietnam, etc.) were it not for Watergate.

Ford-Good guy, but didn't do too much. Also pardoned Nixon which many agree was a bad move.

Carter-Total disaster of a presidency.

Reagan-Helped end the Cold War. Got us out of stagflation. One of the greats, evidenced by the biggest landslide in history.

Bush I-Great. Continued Reagan's legacy, oversaw the end of the Cold War, Gulf War, and knew he had to raise taxes, sacrificing a second term for the good of the nation.

Clinton-Pretty good. Rode the internet wave and a good economy. But he disgraced the office of the presidency, which knocks him down a few pegs.

Bush II-Disaster.

Obama-Better than Bush but nothing too notable.

So of the 12 post-WWII presidents, Reagan and Bush I are better than *at least* 8 of them. </TEXT>

Not really a lot of evidence for this? "The past 3 presidents" isn't really a strong sample size.

True, but Obama has been one of the more popular presidents of the past few decades and his "successor" still lost. It on the candidate more than the previous president.

The Dems could have run a potato with a D next to it and won.

And Hillary will lose to Donald Trump. McCain lost as bad as he did because Obama was a force of nature and he had Palin as VP. McCain absolutely would have stood a chance against Clinton. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Direct popular vote is the best system for determining the president, and it's not remotely the same thing as governing by referendum. Applying concerns about tyranny of the majority to the EC is a complete misunderstanding of the institution, because the EC is a majority rule system, albeit an unfair one. The only check it has against popular rule is the freedom of electors to defy the popular vote, but I don't believe this will ever happen so it's entirely a theoretical benefit.

Direct popular vote is inferior. Tyranny of the majority WOULD be an issue without the EC because then candidates would only need to appeal to people in large cities. The President needs to appeal to ALL people in the country. This is balanced by giving those outside of cities slightly more voting power.

That's not what the Senate is. State legislatures used to choose senators back in the day but now they don't, now it's the people in the states that vote. This makes it just a screwed up way to allot votes totally out of proportion to population, according to arbitrary geographical lines that we can't change. We already have the House to represent local interests. There is nothing special about states with smaller populations that makes them especially worthy of disproportionate representation. (It's incoherent to say that the Senate is "a check on the federal government" since the Senate is part of the federal government.) I do think a bicameral system where the Senate is chosen in a different manner from the House is a very good idea, but two-per-state is a completely unfair way to do it, a way that seriously compromises the legitimacy of our government. States as corporate entities already have an extremely powerful check on the federal government, namely their own governments, which have their own very potent powers including taxation and police power.

The Senate was literally founded as a check against both the House and the Federal Government in general. The UNITED STATES is a UNION of STATES, and as such, they are each equal, regardless of population, land area, resources, etc. Without the Senate, only a few states would determine the direction of the country, which is intolerable. The people of Alabama are going to have different priorities than the people of Connecticut, and the Senate exists so that ALL people of the nation are heard EQUALLY.

This is a huge issue. If you don't think so, you're not informed.

You misunderstand me. Gerrymandering *could* be a huge issue, but as of the present it is not. In the 2012 elections gerrymandering was estimated to cost the Democrats only 7 seats, or ~1% of the House. It is hardly a problem.

 Judges are appointed by a partisan official, the president. Other countries don't do it this way.

That is literally the point. Each of the 3 branches is a check on the others. The checks on the SCOTUS (Judicial) are that the President (Executive) nominates and the Senate (Legislative) approves.

For decades, presidents have completely ignored the supposed power of Congress to declare war because it seems that it doesn't mean anything at all.

I agree with you there. But, that is not a problem with the Constitution itself.

You aren't being serious here.

I am. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The Electoral College is a terrible system of representation

So what would be a better one? Direct democracy? Hell no. That's how you get things like Brexit. People often don't know enough to make the best decision and tyranny of the majority is a real issue.

The Senate is an even worse system of representation

Why? The Senate is how states have a check on the federal government. It's a great system.

 Doesn't protect against gerrymandering

Not an issue.

Doesn't protect voting rights

What? Yes it does. There have been several Amendments regarding voting rights.

The Supreme Court has no explicit power of judicial review (it gave that power to itself)

Alright I'll give you that one.

Lifetime court appointments lead to justices trying to stay on the bench until a president they like is elected

Lifetime appointments maintain the integrity of the Court as part of Checks and Balances. If they were rotated out every few years it would just be used as a tool by the current President.

Partisan appointment of judges

Not sure what your point is here. Care to elaborate?

Unclear which branch controls war powers

Yes it does. The President is the Commander in Chief and the Legislative Branch declares war. Simple as that.

The First Amendment is too vague on limits of free speech

"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech". Not vague at all. NO LAW ABRIDGING.

Unclear on separation of church and state

I agree with that one.

The Second Amendment is so badly worded that we're still arguing about what its literal meaning is

"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed". It is worded perfectly. "Well regulated" meaning in working order. "The People" meaning everyone who wants to. The wording is fine. The problem is Democrats not liking the wording.

Unclear what "cruel and unusual punishment" is (a word like "unusual" is begging for changing interpretations over time)

Agreed.

Unclear how much of the Bill of Rights can be applied without resorting to the Incorporation Doctrine

Agreed.

Doesn't say whether or not a state can secede

Agreed.

Unclear if the Senate has the right to refuse to even consider officials that the President wants to appoint

Not unclear at all. Nowhere does it say that a vote or hearing MUST be held. The Senate must consent to an official for him to get the job. Very clear.

Unclear on rights of non-citizens and rights at border crossings

Agreed.

1. Thinks that illegal immigrants should have a right to stay if they've been working hard and following the law, and that deporting them is a ludicrous idea

2. Thinks that we should support the rebels in Syria, but not directly involve ourselves

3. Thinks that we should cooperate with both European and Middle Eastern countries to defeat ISIS

4. Thinks that the US should stay a firm ally of Israel

5. Seems unclear on Obamacare as the Republican rhetoric is firmly towards repealing it, but wants to expand Medicare and Medicaid

6. Believes that man-made climate change is a threat and supports renewable energy, although not aggressively

7. Seems to err on the side of drug treatment rather than punishment, predictable rhetoric about bringing police and communities together

<TITLE> Does experience really matter in regards to the Presidency? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-01 23:15:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It is common to talk about how "experienced" or "qualified" a candidate is during election season. For example, this year, Hillary was commonly called "one of the most experienced and qualified candidates", and a common criticism of Trump was that he had no experience in government. But looking back over at least the last century, experience before taking office has seemed to have no bearing on the quality of a Presidency nor the ability to do the job.

FDR is commonly considered to be one of the greatest presidents of all time, being elected 4 times in landslides and seeing our nation through the Great Depression and WWII. However, his only governmental experience prior to this was 2 years in the New York Senate and 4 years as Governor of New York.

Lincoln was our greatest president. He ended slavery and won the Civil War. He served 1 term in the House over *10 years* before he was elected and spent 8 years in the Illinois House before that.

Eisenhower had no governmental experience whatsoever before he was elected. Despite this, he is commonly cited by both parties as one of the greatest presidents of the 20th century.

Ford spent 24 years in the House, 8 of which were as the Minority Leader, and spent 8 months as VP, but he is generally regarded as a very lackluster and ineffective President.

There are more examples, but I'll stop there. So, does experience really play that big of a role in how well the President is able to do his job? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In 1980 Senator Ted Kennedy ran a brutal campaign against incumbent Jimmy Carter, who was as historic levels of unpopularity. Despite Carter leading through most of the primary, Kennedy was able to win several key states, and refused to concede until the penultimate day of the DNC. To this day it remains the last time an incumbent president has faced a serious primary challenge, with Carter winning only 36 states and 51% of the popular vote.

Could Kennedy have beaten Ronald Reagan, who at the time was considered so extreme that John Anderson won 6.6% of the vote as a "moderate alternative" to Reagan? Or was the Democrat brand tainted by Carter so much that Reagan could have beaten any Democrat? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why did the Reform Party die off? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-18 00:56:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In 1992 Ross Perot ran as an Independent and won 18.9% of the vote, an unprecedented amount of support for a 3rd party candidate. The only 3rd party candidates to achieve a higher level of support were Fillmore in 1856 and Roosevelt in 1912, and both had previously served as President under different parties so they had at least some "street cred" in the election. After creating the official Reform Party he ran again in 1996, winning 8.4% of the vote despite not even appearing in the debates like his previous run. 

Based on these performances, it is clear that a significant portion of the American electorate aligned themselves with Perot's political views and those of the Reform Party. So how did the Reform Party go from such a strong performance in 1996 to winning only 0.4% in the 2000 election, a mere 4 years later? Was the Party too focused on Perot himself that nobody else could successfully represent them? Was Perot's success in 1992 a one time thing, with his 1996 voters merely holdover support from his earlier run? Or did people just realize that in a FPTP system 3rd parties have almost no chance and Reform Party voters moved on to the main 2 parties? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 2000, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader famously won 2.74% of the popular vote. While that seems like almost nothing, since 1928 only 3 Third Party candidates have won higher percentage totals than that: George Wallace in 1968 (13.5%), John B. Anderson in 1980 (6.6%), and Ross Perot in both 1992 and 1996 (18.9% and 8.4%). And since 2000, Third Parties have come nowhere close to Nader's numbers. The highest total seen since then was Gary Johnson in 2012 with 0.99%, still 1% of the vote. So how was Ralph Nader able to win such an abnormally high percentage of the vote for a Third Party candidate? </TEXT>

I finally heard back from them today and they said they wanted me on the show! They offered me a part as one of Truman's co-workers, which is way more than I expected. I didn't think I'd be talking to Truman every day. So obviously I'm excited and want to do it, but I don't want to make any hasty decisions, because this could effect the rest of my life. They haven't gotten back to me with an exact contract yet, but I have a few questions. Will I need to live in the Dome 24/7? Will I need to do any actual insurance work, or just pretend? Am I guaranteed housing on the island indefinitely? Will my friends and family be able to visit me on the island? What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Would a Trump win in November represent a complete rejection of the current Democratic Party by the nation? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-01 01:59:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's no secret that Hillary Clinton is the favorite to win in November. Donald Trump, though, still has a not-insignificant chance of winning, with betting sites and political pundits putting his chances between 1/5 to 1/3. Trump only became a "politician" about a year ago, and is despised by a large portion of the electorate. Clinton has arguably been preparing for this election for decades. Taking this all into account, would Hillary Clinton, arguably the most famous woman politician in the world, losing the Presidential election to Donald Trump of all people signal a complete failure of the Democratic Party nationally?

When the Democrats took both the Senate and the House in 2006 and Barack Obama won the Presidency in 2008, people predicted a period of complete Democratic domination, famously mentioned in James Carville's 2009 book, *40 More Years: How the Democrats Will Rule the Next Generation*. A year and a half later the Republicans made the largest gains in the House since 1938, and today they hold the Senate, House, and the majority of State Legislatures and Governorships. The "Democratic Domination" period hasn't come to fruition, and it seems to be going in the opposite direction. Should Trump win in November, would it mean that the Democratic Party needs to abandon their current platform? Would they double down on the "New Democrat" centrist policies, or begin to cater more to the progressive wing of their party? </TEXT>

<TITLE> What's next for the Muppets? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-07 03:30:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Muppets are some of the most recognizable characters in entertainment. Everyone knows who Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, and Fozzie Bear are. But in recent years their popularity seems to have been waning. From 1999-2011, the Muppets had 2 TV films, the last of which was in 2005. Contrast that with 1976-1999 where they had 6 theatrical films and 5 TV series. That's a very noticeable decline.

After Disney bought the rights to the Muppets in 2004 they really tried to push the characters back into the spotlight, notably with the Bohemian Rhapsody music video, and the 2011 film *The Muppets* was a critical and commercial success, grossing over 160 million dollars and becoming the only one of the 8 Muppet films to win an Academy Award. This excited me, because the Muppet films were some of my favorite movies growing up, and I thought this would be the start of a new era for the Muppets under Disney leadership, much like how they took control of Marvel, and now Star Wars. But the next film, *Muppets Most Wanted*, was far more *meh* than the last film and grossed less than half of what *The Muppets* did. The new TV show also received lukewarm reviews and was cancelled after only one season, leaving me thinking the 2011 film was just a fluke.

This begs the question: do the Muppets have any place in entertainment today? Will they be a curious relic of the past, or will they evolve and become relevant again?  </TEXT>

Bush "stole" the 2000 election, but when asked why they thought that, people generally have two points: more people voted for Al Gore, and Florida was "decided by one vote" by the Supreme Court in *Bush v. Gore*. But these two points really don't have much to do with each other, and are separate issues. Had Bush decisively won the popular vote, would *Bush v. Gore* be as controversial? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Incumbent Gerald Ford was [just barely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_presidential_primaries,_1976) able to beat back opposition from Ronald Reagan to become the Republican nominee, and was very narrowly defeated by Jimmy Carter in the [1976 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1976), losing by 2.1% in the popular vote and by 57 electoral votes. He was even only the second, and to date last, losing candidate to win a majority of states. Would Reagan, without the post-Watergate controversies that Ford had (pardoning Nixon, etc.), have been able to defeat Carter? If so, how would a Reagan presidency coming 4 years earlier have effected the nation? </TEXT>

<TEXT> For a group of like 8 or so 19-20 year olds, what are some movies to watch as a group that will really scare us? Lights off, middle of the night, in a small room. We've tried watching a few (Scream, Children of the Corn), but those weren't really scary because they were cheesy/humorous enough that we had fun picking them apart. What are some that can still effectively scare a group of college-aged kids? </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the past few years it seems like social issues have been getting more and more progressive. Marijuana legalization, gay marriage, they all seem to be moving to 'the left' at a rapid rate. In fact, a Gallup poll done in May 2015 showed that [about the same number of people identify themselves as socially liberal as do socially conservative](https://cmgajcjaybookman.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/5azgvxr0dumyypjuddtcqw.png).

So my question is, are there any social issues that people will become more conservative on? Or will public opinion always move toward the more progressive opinions? What do you think the future of social policy is in the United States? </TEXT>

He seemed to have exploded out of nowhere in September and kept a consistent 2nd place, and even surpassed Trump for a point. But then around November his numbers began to plummet, and is now in 4th place and is still falling.

<TEXT> I've seen it on here and in a few other subs that if Sanders loses Iowa his campaign is pretty much dead in the water, and I agree with that sentiment. However, if he manages to pull off a win in Iowa, and with New Hampshire all but guaranteed for him, where can he go from there. According to RCP's polls, Sanders has been slowly closing the gap between himself and Clinton in both South Carolina and Florida, but is still losing by a very wide margin. A win for him in the first 2 primary states against the 'inevitable' Clinton would certainly turn some heads. Would it be enough to sway more voters to his side and have him be seen as a viable alternative to Clinton, or would he not be able to gather the support? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Final Destination films were one of the most consistent franchises of the 2000s, with 5 films coming out between 2000 and 2011. While they received mostly mixed critical reception, they were huge hits at the box office, with 4/5 films making well over $100 million, and the series as a whole is still one of the highest-grossing horror franchises. With the final film (Final Destination 5, 2011) having the second highest box office gross and the best critical reception, it seems like it would make sense to make another. But as of now, there has been no sign of another sequel being made. It seems like it would be a no-brainer to me to make another one, and I would certainly like to see another. So why do you think we haven't gotten one? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I first saw The Blair Witch Project when I was 10, and it scared the crap out of me. I thought it was real and those people really died, because it was the first found footage film that I ever saw. I saw it again a few years later in the middle of the whole found footage craze that  happened after 'Paranormal Activity', and it didn't have the same impact, but I attribute that mainly to me having known the ending already. A few of my friends and I are getting a horror movie night going where we each pick a movie, and I want to pick this one. Now that found footage is extremely commonplace, would the film still be scary to newcomers who have never seen it? </TEXT>

<TITLE> The future of the the 'Evil Dead' franchise. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-17 04:16:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Evil Dead series is among my favorite horror franchises. The original was, and still is, one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The later 2 films are hilarious, and it was great to see Bruce Campbell back as Ash in the new TV series. I even loved the 2013 reboot film, which I think is criminally underrated. Prior to the announcement of *Ash vs. Evil Dead*, I remember both Rami and Campbell stating that there were plans for an Army of Darkness 2 and an Evil Dead ('13) 2, followed by a crossover that would merge the two narratives. But since then, Campbell has denied involvement in an Army of Darkness 2, and I have not heard any updates regarding the sequel to the 2013 film. With Ash vs. Evil Dead renewed for a season 2, and with no updates regarding the planned crossover, is it safe to assume that these plans have been put on hold indefinitely? Or might Ash vs. Evil Dead take the place of 'Army of Darkness 2' in the original plan?

<TITLE> Respect Toph Beifong, The Blind Bandit (Avatar: The Last Airbender) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-20 23:33:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Toph Beifong](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/4/46/Toph_Beifong.png/revision/latest?cb=20131230122047) is the only daughter of Earth Kingdom nobles, Lao and Poppy Beifong. Intending for her to become a respected noblewoman, Toph's blindness caused her parents to try to keep her locked up. But Toph's blindness became her strength, and led her to become the greatest earthbender in the world.

###Early Biography

Toph was born to Lao and Poppy Beifong. After discovering that she was blind, they tried to keep her locked up in their estate to protect her. Toph, not satisfied with this life, ran away when she was young. She met badgermoles (the first earthbenders), who were also blind, and they taught her their techniques and how to see with earthbending (seismic sense). As she grew older, Toph became one of the most powerful earthbenders in the world, and was a champion fighter at 'Earth Rumble IV' under the guise of 'The Blind Bandit' when she was only 12 years old. After an encounter with Aang, Katara, and Sokka, she agreed to travel with them to teach Aang earthbending and help end the 100 Year War.

###Earthbending, Metalbending, and Sandbending Skill

Toph has been described as the 'greatest earthbender in the world'. She invented the art of metalbending and mastered 4 of the 5 known earthbending sub-skills (earth, metal, seismic sense, and sand).

- [Senses metal that had been circulating in Korra's body for 3 years](https://youtu.be/1v8v3dN9npE?t=240). For comparison, Korra and Suyin (both masters) were completely unaware that she still had metal inside of her.

- [By old age, her seismic sense had grown to a range of miles with the aid of the spirit vines, being able to sense prisoners being moved to a prison](https://youtu.be/---AydjgqYI?t=72).

###Physicals

**Endurance**

<TEXT> After seeing [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/32k1i0/how_the_hell_could_the_powerpuff_girls_defeat/) by /u/selfproclaimed, it got me thinking about whether the PPGs could take Goku.

Round 1: Saiyan Saga Goku

Round 2: Frieza Saga Goku (Goku can go SSJ)

Round 3: Cell Saga Goku (Goku can go SSJ)

Round 4: Buu Saga Goku (Goku can go SSJ3)

Round 5: Post-BoG Goku (Goku can go SSJ1). The PPGs have a month of prep.

Goku is in-character, but the PPGs are willing to kill. They can get help from anyone in their universe for the prep, but everyone besides the PPGs are in-character. Goku and the PPGs are unaware of the fights until they happen (besides Round 5 where the PPGs have prep). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mild-mannered reporter Bruce Nolan had what he thought was an awful life. He had just been passed over for a promotion, had gotten fired from his job, and was mad at the world in general. But, after blaming God for all his problems, the Big Guy gave him a challenge: do the job better. And so, Bruce became Bruce Almighty, bestowed with all of the powers of God.

Bruce has complete control over God's powers, and can use them in any way he chooses, with 2 rules: He cannot tell anyone that he is God, and he cannot mess with free will. Bruce's new divine powers gave him a wide array of abilities, including...

What was the point of waiting a few months to air only 2 episodes before taking another several-month-long break? It would have made more sense (to me, at least) to just air these last 2 back in November/December and *then* take the break. Is it just Disney's weird airing schedule, or is there an actual reason? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jimmy and Dexter have just learned that the Imperial Navy (Star Wars) is heading towards Earth and intends to take it over! Can their combined brainpower create a defense strong enough to defeat them?

Round 1: 10 Star Destroyers.

Round 2: The Fleet from the Battle of Yavin (no Death Star). 

Round 3: The First Death Star.

Round 4: The Fleet from the Battle of Yavin (with Death Star).

Round 5: The Fleet at its height with both Death Stars.

A win for Jimmy and Dexter is either destroying the Fleet or forcing them to turn back. A win for the Empire is successfully invading and taking over the planet or destroying all defenses. The Death Stars *cannot* destroy the planet, but it can target any enemy ships. Jimmy and Dexter are not limited to space defenses (they can put extra defenses on the ground incase ships enter the atmosphere). Dexter and Jimmy have all of the resources and manpower they need (they will have people to fly any ships they make, etc.). Canon Star Wars only. Vader and the Emperor are not present.

EDIT: Jimmy cannot travel to Timmy Turner'a dimension to make wishes.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> CMV: The United Nations should have their own army. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-10 17:44:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think the United Nations should have their own army made up of volunteers from the member states, and under their sole jurisdiction. Currently, for peacekeeping missions, the UN must ask their members nicely for them to send volunteers, and this can lead to conflict of interest between nations. Take the Rwandan Genocide. The United States chose not to send troops after their failure in Somalia, and other nations also chose not to get involved. With a private army, the United Nations may get involved without needing to ask for troops.

<TEXT> If we assume the Roman Empire was the "First Rome" and the Byzantine Empire was the "Second Rome", several nations made claims of being the "Third Rome". The Ottoman Empire claimed to be it when they conquered Constantinople. The Russian Empire claimed to be it because Ivan III married Sophia Palaiologina, the niece of the last Byzantine Emperor. 

Basically, after the fall of Constantinople, did any nations say, "Okay, those guys are Rome now". </TEXT>
