<TEXT> I wet the bed until I was 14, it wasn't caused by anything psychological (and it's actually pretty common), I guess the muscles/ neural connections that stop you from peeing yourself while asleep just didn't develop fully until then. When I was 10 a quack psychologist told my parents it was because of "Oppositional Defiant Disorder" despite me being a goody-two-shoes who did everything adults told me to. The whole "diagnosis" was literally based off of me wetting the bed and my mom writing in a journal one day that I wouldn't brush my hair that morning. Poop-related stuff would definitely be a sign of something going on psychologically though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in Girl Scouts from kindergarten up through high school. At the younger levels it was pretty boring and I was jealous of my brother who I thought got to do more fun things, but at the older level we got to do a lot more fun stuff than the Boy Scouts and we went on a lot of trips. 

Also, Girl Scouts (at least in my experience) is much more progressive than Boy Scouts overall. My brother's Boy Scouts group was a bit backwards and had a lot of religious crazies. I wouldn't want to join Boy Scouts just because of the personalities of many of the people there/ running it and the much more religiously-oriented, conservative nature of it. Although granted there were two Boy Scouts groups in my town and my brother accidentally joined the super religious one and just ended up staying in it. </TEXT>

I don't think that's the case when talking about the past because it was the norm back then, although I do think it would have been better if it didn't happen. So those people need to break the chain and not spank their own children, because nowadays it is not normal and we know it's harmful.

It used to be normal for husbands to spank their wives, in a serious way. </TEXT>

Just because I feel like venting, my dad's girlfriend's brother (a very religious former pastor) started going on a rant during Easter dinner about how he thought abortion should be illegal and blah blah blah and that he believed in universal healthcare and thought college education should be free but voted for Donald Trump because "he's pro-life". He then asked all the men at the table for their opinions, (who all agreed with him), and completely ignored all the women at the table, including me, and I was sitting right in front of him and had just been talking to him. Whenever I tried to say something he cut me off.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not in my personal experience. The older people in the Boston area are (and really New England in general) the more likely they are to have stronger accents. 

I grew up in a somewhat wealthier town near Boston and people under 40 or so mostly have generic sounding American accents except for saying wicked a lot, while most people over 40ish do generally have accents.

 In the more working class/ townie-ish towns in the Boston area young people will have the accent too, but older people are still more likely to have stronger accents.

In Boston itself it really depends on the neighborhood, but the accent is definitely dying out and you hear it more often in the towns surrounding Boston than actually in the city. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get weird reactions from people for being allergic to eggs and nuts. Sometimes people will act like I'm making it up and basically one of those "gluten free" people, and I've had someone go on a rant about how people are weak these days and I should just stuff my face with cake until I'm not allergic to it anymore. I've also had people (completely seriously) say that if they were allergic to ____, life wouldn't be worth living. 

If you aren't exposed to a food from childhood you generally don't like it. The idea of sugary bready food like cake or doughnuts just grosses me out. I tried some once and it was disgusting. People don't seem to realize that people with allergies aren't just walking around craving the same things they do all the time and not being able to eat it. That's not how it works! </TEXT>

I'm growing it out right now and it's my natural hair color down to about my ears and the rest of it is bleach blonde. I can't dye it darker since it's too damaged and the color won't stick, and I can't cut it because I look terrible with short hair, so I'm pretty much stuck with it. Is ombre hair so horribly outdated that I'd be better off just cutting it all off and looking like crap? lol. </TEXT>

When I was 15 and taking drivers ed classes (right after my mom died) they forced us to watch all of these horrible depressing documentaries about people who died or worse in drunk driving accidents and this one about a lady whose face melted off in a car accident but she survived.

<TEXT> It's obviously not true, the oldest person alive at a given point in time is usually about 114 and it's almost always if not always a woman. The oldest recorded person ever made it an extra 8 years to 122 which is insane already. The longest lived men are significantly younger. Even if it was a woman claiming to be 137 it would be impossible, but especially considering that it's a man, there is absolutely 0 chance his claims are true. </TEXT>

I found an old photo album and turns out, he used to have fire engine-red hair. He also used to be very pale and accumulated so many freckles that it turned into a tan. So that explained why I'm ghost-level pale. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate it when people spout that "the human body was designed to retain fat" nonsense. The human body was designed to survive and function during periods of famine through burning fat stores, people can generally go with very little food and be just fine. I used to let this crap scare me into eating at least 1200 calories a day even when I'm on a diet, but I'm a generally sedentary 5'2 woman and only need 200-300 more calories than that to stay the *same* weight, so it's not such good advice for me. I'd only be losing half a pound a week on that! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically the US was started out of a bunch of different colonies that had never worked together and didn't really want to be one country in the first place. The South in particular definitely wouldn't have joined if they couldn't make their own rules (there was that whole slavery thing) and were still borderline on seceding up until the Civil War. Creating a single country-wide government from scratch and getting rid of the state ones just wouldn't have worked.

Personally I'm damn thankful that things are mostly run on the state level, the federal government is a shitshow and most of the other states suck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get the line of thinking unfortunately. People who've managed to change something are always the harshest towards people who haven't, since they think "if I can do it anyone can" and because they want to distance themselves from it since they're afraid of becoming that way again. It's the same with rich people who look down on poor people. When I was anorexic I used to frequent fatpeoplehate since I wanted to distance myself from that as much as possible so that I wouldn't gain weight. In my opinion, it's nothing but a symptom of people's own insecurities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have social anxiety disorder. It got worse when I developed anorexia and isolated myself for a long time as a result. I've had issues with drug addiction to cope with my social anxiety that probably made it even worse in the long run. It's going to be a long and tough road for me to get anywhere close to normal, if I ever do. 

It's a huge downer to explain all my issues to people nor do they probably want to hear about it, plus they'll just think I'm weird (I am but I'd rather people didn't know that) so I just say I'm introverted and call it a day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wish I was a normal person. But if you're not very talkative you get people asking what's wrong with you and calling you shy all the time even if you aren't. People just assume you're oversensitive and weak, so saying you're introverted is a way of saying "I'm not weak and I don't give a shit what you think about me" while explaining your lack of talkativeness. At least it is to me. </TEXT>

But I also have an anxiety disorder and I'm a very internally focused person, so weed just amplifies that for me I guess. The muscle spasms were likely caused by the anxiety disorder in the first place though so not from anything like cerebral palsy. </TEXT>

Any little bit of fat on myself I saw as evidence of gluttony and that I thought I deserved to eat well, so I wanted to get rid of it as "proof" that I thought I wasn't worthy of food.

<TEXT> It changed but I limited myself to 450 calories a day most days with the goal of losing 2 lbs per week. I would do less if I could but that was generally the least I could eat while avoiding binging the next day. I had calculated that I burn 1450 calories a day without exercise so burning 1000 calories per day would equal 2 lbs lost per week. I didn't always stick to it though and would "binge" or eat less occasionally. I say "binge" but a binge would mean eating like 1000 calories that day, and I'd fucking hate myself for it and fast for the next day to make up for it.

A typical example of something I'd eat in a day is black coffee in the morning, a 100-calorie protein shake around 3 PM ish or whenever I could avoid eating until, then I wouldn't eat until it got dark out usually and I'd have something like a 250-calorie TV dinner with turkey and mashed potatoes. I ate a lot of those. If I didn't have that I might have a bowl of bran flakes or some baked cod or beans or something. The extra 100 calories or so I would use for tiny snacks throughout the day (usually after I had eaten "dinner"). I'd eat low-to-zero calorie things like pickles/ vegetables/ chicken broth/ sugar-free jello to hold me over if I got really hungry. I avoided "sugar free" things and diet soda most of the time though because it tended to give me a headache and gave me diarrhea, and would often lead to me eating more. Popsicles were also something I used occasionally, the kind I got were like 25 calories. Sometimes I'd have things like seaweed salad or miso soup as a treat, although they do have calories in them despite being low-calorie. If I was forced to go to a restaurant I'd try to insist on going to a Japanese place and only eating those things or I'd get hot pot and only eat the broth and vegetables. Although those things would usually take up most of my day's calorie budget so I'd avoid it. I wouldn't eat anything else at a restaurant because restaurant food has an extreme amount of calories and you don't know how many calories are in it most of the time. Restaurant food in particular really scared me and it took a long time to be able to eat at one normally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just be there to support the person and try to get them to go out and do things. Isolation is one of the most dangerous things for an anorexic in my opinion and lots will isolate themselves given the opportunity. Encourage them to get help or to see a councilor if possible, it helps a lot more than you would think. Remind them that they're valued and important. At the end of the day though, it's really up to them to get help and to change their mindset and there's only so much you can do. Don't blame yourself for what they're going through. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my case I started having heart papiltations and it scared me. I also realized that I fucked up my digestive system and couldn't digest things the way I used to. I was pissed off and tired all the time, and had isolated myself because I didn't want people to see me until I lost weight (it was never enough weight) and because it's hard to avoid food in social situations. Basically the situation I was in scared me into gaining weight. I still have issues with self-image but gaining weight somehow helped me snap out of it. It's different for everyone, but I think the lack of food encourages anorexic thought patterns. I also started being around people a lot more and I think the social interaction and support from friends helped a lot. I didn't have that while I was sick. It's always an issue for me though and I have to be careful to avoid slipping back into my old habits, so I think of it kind of like an addiction. It's kind of similar to quitting smoking or drinking in a way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of the time yes but not as often as you would think, you lose your appetite to match the amount you eat most of the time. Occasionally you will get really hungry and binge but it's usually not until after you start eating. Getting weak from lack of food always bothered me more than being hungry, you can just ignore hunger and it goes away while weakness just tends to get worse over time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Another fun fact: in that period of time, [King Philip's War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Philip's_War), the deadliest war per capita in North American history, broke out due to increasing tensions over the colonists continuing to expand. At the start of the war, King Philip said "I am determined not to live until I have no country". By the end of the war, 12 of New England's towns were destroyed, 1/10 of adult male colonists were killed, and the Wampanoags and Narragansetts were almost completely obliterated. </TEXT>

It's not like bumfuck, Missouri gets a huge amount of immigrants. *It doesn't affect them.* But it won't stop them from forcing their will on the parts of America that actually *are* affected by this and *don't fucking want it*. Not only is it hateful and completely pointless, but it damages the economy of northern and western states and cities that pull talent from these countries. </TEXT>

As a Bostonian who knows people directly affected by the Boston bombings, I hate that Trump keeps using them to justify his shit policies that pretty much none of us agree with. We voted 10 to 1 against Trump, and [this was the scene of the protests against his immigration ban,](https://gfycat.com/DirectIdleGentoopenguin) **less than a block away from the bombings.** The whole Commonwealth of Massachusetts is suing Trump over his hateful pointless immigration ban. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My guess it that's because of the large amount of non-practicing Catholics in particular in southern New England. Also, I think I would be included on that map as "religious" since I was baptized as an Episcopal, but I'm agnostic and other than weddings and funerals I haven't been to a church since then. I'm also sure my parents would say they're Catholic and Episcopal respectively if asked but they aren't religious either. </TEXT>

The only real exception being that she waited to endorse the winner of the Democratic primaries instead of endorsing Bernie early on, which some people were upset about but I don't blame her for. She didn't want to divide the Democratic Party. But I love her, she's a true progressive and one of very few in government who actually fights for what she believes in, and she gives the people of Massachusetts a voice. </TEXT>

There's just so much terrible stuff trump has done *already* that I think people are getting overwhelmed, we just recently had the largest protest in US history and there's also a protest on trumps muzzling of scientists happening soon. But this is even more reprehensible to me. </TEXT>
