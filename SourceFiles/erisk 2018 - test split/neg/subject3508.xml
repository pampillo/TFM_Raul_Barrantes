<TEXT> You'll have to go look at his testimony May 8. It was near the middle, I think, when the one GOP senator was trying to get pity for the GOP by claiming that bad stuff about the GOP was released when the hackers released DNC e-mails that contained the background opposition work on the GOP.

But you are correct that only old GOP stuff was hacked. Apparently, they didn't get into the current RNC stuff, though they tried.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fact that you "don't get it" speaks volumes. Sure, perhaps Trump really did think from day one that Comey needed to go. But he did not fire him then. Why not? Why now? *THAT* is why this is such a huge story.

I mean, it's this striking inability on the part of the Trump administration to understand optics. 

AND THAT'S NOT EVEN GETTING INTO REPORTS THAT HE SAID JUST RECENTLY "COME UP WITH A REASONS TO FIRE HIM". Because that shows, "Her e-mails" is not the real reason.

<TEXT> I am of the opinion that you are mostly right, BUT that some people in the Trump campaign (I'm thinking Manafort and Page) *definitely* knew they were personally benefitting from helping Russia influence the election. *Someone* (or maybe more than one person) in the Trump campaign was in fact colluding with the Russians all along.

But I think Trump was more "oh, you guys were getting paid by thte Russians to help me win? Well, okay then - I did win! Great!" But that he was probably not making those deals himself.

Like everyone rails on Trumps for "Asking the Russians to hack Clinton's e-mails". I doubt Trump was in face asking that - he was amking a stupid joke. BUT someone probably told him to make that joke. 

For example. Say Manafort needed to prove to the Russians that he could influence Trump. So he jokingly suggests to Trump to make that "joke" on TV. The Russians see that and know it is the signal from Manafort that Manafort is indeed a player here. 

Manafort surely got millions from the Russians and surely gave the Russians valuable informtion on how to release wikileaks for max damage to Clinton, etc. And he surely got paid for the GOP taking Ukraine out of its platform. And I think the intelligence community knows this for sure. 

Trump gets into trouble because - just like Nixon - he now knows these things and is trying to cover it up. And his Achilles heel is that he feels "loyalty" to these people and cannot admit he was wrong about them. His ego will bring him down. 

As for me, of course, I'm just speculating.

<TEXT> Everyone is thinking that this is mostly all about Flynn talking to the Russian Ambassador. 

Clapper is pointing out (over and over) that 107(?) concerns Foreign targets OVERSEAS. 

This means that apart from Flynn talking to the Russian ambassador, the Intelligence Community picked up conversations (I'm guessing in which US persons were a party or were discussed) *not* from the Russian embassy in the US.

So, my takeaway is that the IC has access to conversations concerning Trump or ( much more likely) his campaign associates which were made overseas (like gained from assets in Russia ) and which were disturbing enough that the someone unmasked the US persons in order to see the context of what the foreign target's intent was. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, you're right; I really don't get it.

I mean I understand, but this is human history. One group culturally assimilates another, time after time. Be angry, that's fine, if you like. I get angry, too, when my culture is encroached upon by a nearby, more dominant culture. But that's not going to stop time.

Case in point: read the wikipedia entry on this tribe and you will see that they assimilated other tribes in the past. Who is going to call them out on that? 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anishinaabe#Historical_relations_between_the_Anishinaabeg_and_other_indigenous_groups

Other closely related Algonquin groups such as the Zhiishiigwan and Amikwaa were incorporated into the Anishinaabe peoplehood through alliances.

More on the Amikwaa:

The Amikwa were nearly wiped out by disease and wars with the Iroquois and the last of the tribe appear to have merged with the Nipissings or the Ojibwe.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amikwa_people

Back to the main point of my previous comment: I see little to no difference in one person saying "hurr, I can do that, too!" vs "Gee, I'd like to do that, but I'm also going to invest a lot of time "learning about the indigenous peoples' culture and customs with them". The politically correct thing for the tribe to do would have been to reach out to her and assimilte *her*, rather than making a fuss that is only going to turn the dominant culture away from them.

ALSO: Please don't forget to project some anger against young black women who want to do ballet because they are turning their backs on their own culture, betraying their own roots and "giving in to the whites". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just read that wiki entry and this jumped out at me:

Other closely related Algonquin groups such as the Zhiishiigwan and Amikwaa were incorporated into the Anishinaabe peoplehood through alliances.

So, basically, the Anishinaabe culturally annihilated the Zhiishiigwan and Amikwaa tribes, I guess.

<TEXT> I'm not looking for a solution. i'm honestly wondering why facebook does not simply allow it organically.

it is for security reasons?

maybe Zuckerberg's has personal or religious reasons for not allowing pdfs?

maybe there are licencing issues?

Zuckerberg is under pressure from the images mafia to keep pdfs off "their turf"?

Not worse than what we got, but in some ways, worse. Imagine the GOP obstructionism is that case and Chaffetz shit-eating grin on TV every fucking day.

At least with IncompeTrump in office, the Dems won on the budget bill. That bill would probably have been worse under Clinton, because the GOP would have shut down government over it, you know it's true.

<TEXT> I think this is an good example of the free hand of the market. 

BUT, I also think that free hand is showing to advertisers that ad-blocking doesn't really hurt hm, because the overwhelming umber of visitors to a website who are going to fall for thoe ads, don't use ad-block anyhow. While at the same time, turning off access to the minority who do use ad-block *might* get some of them to turn it off.

It's all about the money numbers. Until the vast majority of people use ad block and advertising revenue actually srrinks because of this, ugly ads are not going to change.

I guess that is logical in its own twisted sort of way. And by that I mean if you are in the health insurance gangsters' pockets and want as many children as possible to have pre-existing conditions as soon as they are in the world trying to get their own coverage so that that coverage can be as damned expensive as those gangsters feel is their right endowed from on high, then sure, that would help the big bucks to keep flowing via their pockets into yours as a self-righteous, holier-than-thou congress-scum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Warning: 

The above "neo-Nazis in Ukraine" website (Global Research) has a less-than-stellar reputation.

https://www.quora.com/Journalistic-Ethics-and-Norms-How-legitimate-is-The-Centre-for-Global-Research

It is by no means an objectively reliable media source. The articles, videos, and other media it puts forth are highly skewed and often factually inaccurate.

Also, see here:

http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Globalresearch

While some of GlobalResearch's articles discuss legitimate humanitarian concerns, its view of science, economics, and geopolitics is conspiracist  if something goes wrong, the Jews West didit! The site has long been a crank magnet: If you disagree with "Western" sources on 9/11, or HAARP, or vaccines, or H1N1, or climate change, or anything published by the "mainstream" media, then GlobalResearch is guaranteed to have a page you will love.  </TEXT>

Can we not find out who the editor is for the segment that this graphic ran on and shame him or her to hell?

I mean there are real people at Fox making the decisions to show this stuff. Why can't we call them out by name?

I want to know who made the call on this and who implemented it. Somewhere, there is a gaphic designer sitting in the bowels of Fox who actually opened Illustrator and Photoshop and made this thing. 

Who is he/she and who gave the command to draw it?

<TEXT> Yeah, except there is absolutely no guarantee the new NAFTA will be better for the United States. 

I mean, I'd love to read a paper on exactly what Trump hopes to get from renegotiating. But so far, I haven't seen that.

And as for your point: 

Make your starting position more extreme that what you want, and then slowly move in.

Your starting position has to be believable or people will know you are bluffing. "USA unilaterally just pulling out of NAFTA" is exactly that - extreme. It's like starting a negotiation by saying "If you don't let me have this and this and this, I'm going to slam this huge hammer on all our thumbs, including mine!"

Everybody be like: "Okayyyy...?"

But you're right, it's not hard at all to see how incompetent Trump is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sanctions by deifnition are temporary as they are meant to influence behaviour. If sanctions were permanent there would be no incentive to change.

<TEXT>  NBC News confirmed that the three-star general is being vetted by the Trump campaign. 

Looks like NBC *confirmed nothing*, but merely assumed he was being vetted on the "say-so" of a member of the Trump campaign.

NBC: Are you vetting Flynn?

Trump team: you betcha!

NBC: Well, okie-dokie then!

And to be fair, normally it is perfectly fine to assume someone is in fact being vetted when the campaign in question tells you it is.

<TEXT> What a complete crock of shit from someone woefully uninformed about life outside of the United States.

 I pay 30% percent taxes and see nothing back whatsoever.

The fuck you don't. US roads, schools etc may not be the best in the world, but fuck man, have you ever been anywhere else? "Nothing back whatsovere", what a laugh!

 I live in a police state where I can easily be shot and killed with no repercussion towards the officer that killed someone that was unarmed.

Maybe you are black in which case forgive me. But lemme just say "hyperbole much"? 
 
 I have no say whatsoever in the wars my country is involved in.

Dude, you can VOTE, dammit. You may not have much say, but "no say whatsoever" is just patently false. Stop whining and campaign.

 My government tracks and watches my every move. If I disagree with our current system, foreign policy or war motives, I can be labeled a terrorist, and confined indefinitely, as well as tortured.

I guess "technically true"? But trust me, the world knows far worse places to be against the government, to be "the opposition". Have you heard of any of them, or are you really that in the dark?

 I am a citizen of the United States. I am not free.

You know, this line right here ^ is what pushed me over to write this. You claming to be *not free* in the United States is really like all those white Americans who say "I feel so discriminated against". I'm sure any black person in the US will tell you that is bullshit. And coming on here and claiming you are "not free" while a citizen of the United States is really quite offensive to people who live in you know, actual totalitarian places. 

I mean go for it man, get together with the North Koreans and have a pity pary together about how fucking not free you all are. I'm sure they'll lend you a shoulder to cry on.

<TEXT> Their next question proved more difficult: who was the man behind the parchment? Allen and Sneff believe the leading candidate was **James Wilson**, a Pennsylvania delegate to the continental congress, one of six men to sign both the declaration and constitution, and, later, **one of the original supreme court justices**. The researchers argue that Wilson, who **argued vociferously for a popularly-elected president** and separation of powers, played a more influential role in American history than most historians have recognized.

He is saying that the authorities in Russia are using the cover of "this guy is gay!" to get rid of political opponents who are not gay, because calling them gay keeps the public off the authorities' back over it, because the prevailing mood in Russia is "ewww, gays!"

Any actual rounding up of real gay men is not what he was referring to at all.

<TEXT> No he doesn't have $770. Unless you are claming he has absolutely ZERO expenses. and my exampe showed HE PAID TO HAVE HIS BARN FIXED.

So, he has $770 MINUS the cost of fixing his barn, minus the cost of running electricity to his barn, minus everything else. So, you are essentially saying that he has to have a 23% margin to BREAK EVEN.  

I mean that is simply ludicrous. But thank you for having opened my eyes to what a joke "FairTax" is. </TEXT>

I'm curious how reliable that information is? Can we take him at face value?

Fine, so when he pays to have his barn repaired, the guys who gets his money for that pays 23% of that in taxes.

<TEXT> So, no deductions for expenses? The farmer has to pay for maintainence on his barn/chicken coops, eletricity and so forth, even if he is somehow miraculously growing all his own feed with no expenses. 

So, what happens in a business where expenses are up to 85% of his revenue? If he's giving the government 23% then he is 8% in the red.

And by the way, maintainance on his barn is certailny not a "used good", it's a service. So, what if he is too old to repair it himself and has to hire someone to do it? 

Like I said, this makes no sense to me at all.

<TEXT> Oh, goddamit, you have no idea what you are talking about. 

Be warned, this is not a response to you, but to the casual lurker.

Borders as lines that define what government controls what land, and by extension the people living on that land, are very important. And keeping those borders secure from encroachment by other government who would seek to control the land behind them and the people living on that land is of paramount importance because that keeps governments/countries from going to war.

On the other hand, when countries use those same borders to inhibit the free flow of ideas, capital and so on - yes, even labour if countries agree to that - is also good. 

Why?

Because this contributes to the welfare of the people on all sides of these borders and that, too, reduces the chance of war.

Now, you can disagree on refugee issues and so on, but snide remarks like OP's really only serve to confuse the issue.

For example, in Hillary Clinton's often ridiculed remarks along the lines of dreaming of a day with no borders in the Westerm hemisphere, she meant the latter. A large secure and prosperous trading bloc. NOT anyone can flee to whereever they want. 

Again, whether or not governments actually adhere to these ideals is one thing. The powerful ones often step on the toes of the little parnters in such bloc - see Germany in the EU for example.

<TEXT> A pro-Dem super PAC needs to focus on changing the mentality in the state. 

Mormons vote GOP not only because they are conservtive, but because the US government literally went to war again them in the 1800s and they remember that. Hence - they want no big government interfering. It's a different fish than the general "keep government out of my life and business" sentiments in other places.

Two, one of their prophets, E.T.Benson was a Bircher. And a lot of that leaked voer to the general Mormon population, since "when the prophet has spoken, the thinking has been done" vibes they have.

So, to coutner that, a Super PAC needs to focus ads on three main points:

1) Compassion. Stress the value of compassion and show that Dems support that value 100%. 

2) In fact, it's not a sin to vote for  Dem. Because a lot of them feel it borders on sin. After all, that prophet was a Republican right!?

3) Families. Present some great ads on families and the things families can do together that are related to government programs like visiting National Parks. Also, explain what Planned Parenthood is and why some people really need it. 

Also, go door to door with this message in pairs, dressed in white shirts and business slacks. Maybe even by bicycle. That'll get them.  </TEXT>

In order to troll a president who has no comprehension of the details that make policy difficult (see his 10 conversation with the Chinese leader), one "trolls" him with a quote that essentially says:

"From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. Why do they look petty from uo there?

Yeah, because you cannot see the details at all and think there is a super easy solution to everything. I mean, I get it, "petty" as in there is no reason for us to all disagree, but that's just like Trump saying "We should get along with Russia". 

Of course we should. But look at the details showing why we don't.

I think these people trolled themselves. </TEXT>

And what I mean by that if "No shit, Sherlock, of course we talked about the sanctions. It's like the biggest economic topic in Russia because it hurts them. Everybody asks Americans - especially anyone remotely involved in politics about the sanctions."

*Then* he could say, "Now that doesn't mean I remember every conversation in detail. It'd be like asking ordinary Americans if they talked about Donald Trump on Nov 9, 2016. Of course they did."

"That said, I certainly never said that Trump could lift sanctions in return for anything or ever mentioned in the context of any deal at all."

BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAYS IN HIS INTERVIEWS, IS IT?

<TEXT> But one would presume that the no-fly zone was put in place by people who would know *why* it was put in place. And they should be pissed/scared to death if those orders were no enforced.

There are a couple of ways around this, I guess.

1) Martians unaware of the prototype soldiers and the dangers they pose put the no-fly zone in place because of the "battle" and those who do know why were just like "Yeah, we can roll with that".

2) It was in fact put in place by people (person) in the know, but that person (Martian killed by Errinwright) is dead so, no-one knew how serious it was as a precaution. 

That thing though is going to run to her father and cry next time though. I'm convinced. They should ship her to venus to be a family with the other two. </TEXT>

<TEXT> no fucking way Page is getting that 19%. He might be some commission, but the 19% belongs to Manafort and Trump. 

EDIT: And that's even part of why this is an even bigger story than it seems at first sight. Page is why too small time for the Russians to even look at *except* he had access to the Trump campaign. So, they hook him and he starts delivering. But it's not like he can say "If Trump wins, I want 19% in Rosneft." It has to be more "If Trump wins, this is what he wants and what he will do. As for me, I want to retire really, fucking rich". 

So, if the FBI was monitoring Page, then they get to listen to him talk to both the Russians and *Trump's* team and they are specifically looking for any kind of deal betweeen those two sides that Page might be communicating. 

Say there is another layer between Trump and Page. The FBI might suspect Trump /Tillerson / Flynn know, but while they cannot wiretap those guys - but they can sure as hell start here what those guys are telling Page. 

For example:

Page: "[Kellyanne - unmasked as directly relevant in this conversation], did my message get through? What is the response?"

Unmasked Kellyanne: ["Yes, I told Donald yesterday, but he's going to get back to me. You know him, he wants to run everythign by Ivanka and Jared first".]

In other words, everyone who has talked to Page since eaarly 2016 is nervously trying to recreate their conversations with him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Semantics. 

Deploy in fact mean "to move". Which is precisely why in your comment you write "have nukes on deployment" which I guess you mean as "already deployed" as in "in place".

If I asked "where does the US have nukes deployed?" I would expect a different list of places than if I asked "where is the US deploying nukes?"

That said, this line of conspiracy sounds weak to me. Someone is begging for more pepperoni. 

Anyhow, your Hillary parallel is empty, because Trump is in deep shit for his Russian ties. Hillary has not got *that particular* baggage, so no-one would be calling it a "Russian angle".

And besides, the same people saying Trump looks precedential for bombing Syria and the very same ones who would praise Hillary for it.

<TEXT> The Russian story has not gone anywhere.

The point is that Trump's campaign may have colluded with Russia to get Trump into the WH. 

That Trump does something against Russia's interests now, really doesn't mean anything.

I mean, I am not buying what some are flogging - that Trump and Russia set this bombing up to take away from the Russia story. But I think it quite plausible that Trump is not Russia's puppet in the literal sense. Russia's fool a lot of the time - yes. 

But I think the real story to the Russia-Trump scandal is that Russia is achieving its goal of destabilizing the United States. Has their backing Trump come back to bite them in the ass? OR are they and Trump still working together and this is all a set up to "prove" Russia and Trump are not connected?

- It's a 4D chess move. I don't see it.

- I will denounce my support for trump if he invades syria. This is some globalist shit FUCK OFF.

<TEXT> It's overall simply good because it will bring more opportunities. For example, the low coster airlines now trying to come in. 

RyanAir wants to start flying and that means cheaper tickets and more access to more cities. (Personally, I like that they are planning a Kyiv-Stockholm route!)

And not only will Ukrainian tourists win, many many more European tourists will also start considering a trip to Ukraine. "Hey honey, look, it's just 40 euros (or whatever) to fly to Kyiv from London. We ahven't been there, maybe we should try it?"

And that means money coming into Ukraine. Granted, it might not be much to begin with, and overall this might not really make a splash in the country's economic landscape. But I'll just be happy for the specific restaurants and other businesses that will see more cash flow.  </TEXT>

The greatest examples of libertarianism in action are the hundreds of men, women and children standing alongside the roads all over Honduras.

They then stand next to the filled-in pothole soliciting tips from grateful motorists. That is the wet dream of libertarian private sector innovation. </TEXT>

As far as the US government wanting to see Russia destabilized, I doubt it. Would they like to see Putin stop acting like a dick? Yes. But no-one in their right mind wants Russia to be more unstable than it currently is. 

And there you have it - you and I probably see these things/events differently. </TEXT>

So, in choosing between a solution for WATER which is guaranateed to work, Fink is ready to sacrifice that for a "possible try" to control our borders.

Ok, now I'm going to look at a map to see just how vulnerable this Kansas town is to threats coming from across the border. Be right back! 

EDIT: (I was fast!) Here is the map: http://i.imgur.com/QZaAZko.png

As you can see, the residents of Strong City, Kansas have very valid reasons for fearing open borders. While people in Arizona only have to worry about Mexican rapists and freeloaders, and people in Montana are more wary of Canadian serial killers and welfare drains, Strong City Kansaas is almost equidistant from BOTH Mexicao *and* Canada and must worry about threats coming from both the north and the south. 

And I'm not even going to get into how vulnerable they are to missle attacks from both North Korea AND Iceland!

This town's story needs to be upvoted. Please tell your congresscritter to access the browsing history of Strong City Kansas residents so we can target them with ads about how to survive the looming Mexican-Canadian zombie wars! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does it not make more sense to say that time is the first dimension?

To me, it makes no sense at all to simply tack it onto the third dimension. That's pretty much assuming a two dimensional world has no time.

And a line is not as small as you can go. You can go to one point on the line and separate it from all other points on the line. And why not? A line is simply a one line separated from all other lines on a plane.

So, if you have a single point then something is either at that point or it is not. It's purely binary (for now!). And that is time. Schrodinger's point, if you will (maybe you won't).

Consequently, time simply states whether an object is "there" or not. 

Then you add other points and have a line (and as an aside, there is no reason to assume the line is straight since a "straight line" can only be identified when it is on a plane. One a line, I'd argue the concept of "straight" does not even exist).

[[And here I take issue with your saying: *you could just as easily describe that point by its angle to the horizontal and how far it is away from some specified point*. you can only describe a point by it's angle to the horizontal if you define the horizontal first. That that's going to be completely arbitrary *if you are confined to that two-D existence*. And anyhow, I'd argue you are still using "how far and how up", just different math to get there.]]

Now on this line, one can assume that something existing on one point can (might) move to another and so you see time.

And to me that ruins the entire concept of time as a "dimension" at all. Why time? Why not colour?

Say you have a point on a line that is red. Now it is blue. How do you determine that it took time to change from red to blue? Maybe red changing to blue causes time? 

Clearly, I have too much time. So, I'll leave it at that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  contemporary scholars believe Little Russian sentiment endures in Ukraine even today and plays heavily upon the country's political divisions.

I believe this was the case by and large until Russia annexed Crimea. A LOT of Ukrainians who had never before thought of themselves as Ukrainian were "awakened" and now feel very, very much Ukrainian. This is not to say that before March 2014 they thought themselves Russian (certainly not!); they simply never really thought about it. So, I wouldn't say they considered themselves "little Russians" either, but the mentality of not really identifying with a nation did have a, mostly unspoken, place.

Of course this is more in central Ukraine, where I live. In the west, people certainly felt Ukrainian - Lviv, I-Frankivsk, etc. and in the east, many did feel like brothers to the Russians. But in central Ukraine, where there was never a huge nationalist fevour, but people are very much ethnic Ukrainian - mostly speaking Ukrainian at home (well, Surzhik to one degree or another, but children are speaking more literately now as schooling is by and large in Ukrainian), eating "ukrainian" food and wearing ukrainian dress on holidays and so on. But boy-oh-boy do most people in central Ukraine feel Ukrainian now. A backlash to Russia's invasion really, as many people know someone who has fought for Ukraine in the wars. Brothers, fathers and sons have all died fighting for Ukraine and people feel that. But whereas before people might have wondered why they should fight for Ukraine (the government does nothing for us!) now they realize that they do in fact have things they hold dear which are worth fighting for.

The irony here being that Putin probably started the wars in Ukraine to shore up his support at home but in fact did more than any person has in 300 years to bolster Ukrainians' own sense of identity.

<TEXT> That's a difference between Russian and Ukrainian however. "" means edge in Russian, "" in Ukrainian literally means country. 

And this is not something Ukrainians made up, as several Slavic languages use the same:

Polish - kraj

Slovak - krajina

Belarusian - 


Some will even argue that Russia's calling Ukraine "the edge" is because Ukraine always meant "the country" where Ukraine now is (like the Chinese say "middle kingdom") and when some "Ukrainians" (countrymen) emigrated to Russia before it was Russia they referred to the "country" they left as "Ukraine", because that's wat it was. And only later, once Russia eclipsed Ukraine as a power int he region, did "Ukraine" start to mean "at the edge of where we live now", simply because the term "ukraine" as country still existed and it simply gained - in the Russian language - the new meaning of edge as the memory of ukraine as "the country" waned in the minds and culture of residents of Russia.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, it's far more nuanced of course. And if you go back, of course v and na will have different nuances than they have now. 

but overall, in the context of current use today in Russian with regards to Ukraine, the words most definitely have the connotations of supporting or denegrating Ukraine's sovereignty.

And furthermore, Ukrainians who speak English take that to "the Ukraine" vs "Ukraine" as well.

As far as Alaska goes, it must be remembered that Alaska was first part of the Russian empire. So, going "na Alaska" showed you are going to Alaska, which is part of something bigger, the Russian empire. And that stuck after Alaska was sold to the US.

<TEXT> They don't, but interestingly enough, they have prepositions which do the same.

 (Na) vs  (V).

Russians will say " " when talking about something happening "in Ukraine", while Ukrainians speaking Russian will say " ".

The difference is that in the Russian language, "na" is reserved mostly for places which are not sovereign states. "V" is used for soveriegn states. (mostly, not a hard fast rule, just like in English people say "The Netherlands").

So, the Russians who say "na Ukraine" are (knowingly or not) knocking Ukraine's soveriegnty, basically putting it on the level of Alaska - a place that is part of a bigger place. They say "na Alyaska", too, by the way.

Some say, the old way of saying "The Ukraine" in English comes from learning that Russians said "na Ukraine".

Today it is a big deal, actually. Ukrainians on TV, in public peaking will alway say "v Ukraine", but sometimes older people wil say "na" simply because theyve been saying it that way thier entire lives. And if you're not picky about grammar, it's like -  why bother correcting it? 

But Russians who insist on saying "na" usually argue that this is simply "proper Russian".

Languages change and politics also has an influence on them. It's kind of interesting, really. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I had a similar conversation with many people who were quite liberal. Usually they didn't vote for Trump. But, they bought all of the rhetoric the right threw at her **with the help of the Russian government** and therefore didn't vote or voted for a third party candidate (both of the front runners of which were complete fucking morons)

FTFY.

And for the sake of an experiment, it would be interesting to ask these "liberal-but-Hillary-is-shit-so-i-didn't-vote" people what they think of the Trump-Russia scandal.

Ask them that first without giving away the catch, and see if they say "yeah, the Trump administration *must* be investigated for that. See just how adamant you can get them on that specific point. Get them to swear, break dishes, etc.

*And then*, * THEN*, point out that the allegations are that the GOP, in collusion with Russia, tried to make Hillary look bad. PRECISELY SO SHITHEADS LIKE THEM WOULD STAY AT HOME AND NOT VOTE.

<TEXT> Except in this case we are clearly dealing with Trump trying to be president, not trying to play to his core T_D fools.

He did not present the "check" in a public setting where his rabid fans could eat it up and shout about dirty krauts.

He did it in a closed setting where really only Merkel and his and her close aides knew about it.

So, logically (and I know how dangerous it is to apply logic to Trump, but hey, whatyagonnado?), logically, I guess he really thought that this might influence her? Can that be? Let me rephrase that - can he really, honestly be that big league stupid? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, other pro-Trump people are not going to be swayed based n this articlea alone. They don't know the woman or her husband and it's easy for them to dismiss it without that emotional interest in the story.

It's basically a story to allow anti-Trump people to bask in their clearly superior smarts.

<TEXT> It would have been nice for the author of the article to delve into explaining what Appalachia actually is rather than simply repeat over and over that white, male outsiders don't get it.

Let's see how many time the author does this - calls out others' coverage of Appalachia - while avoiding any discussion of substance: 

1) 

The authors establish a region in Appalachia or the Rust Belt as ground zero for the archetypal Trump hillbilly voter while walking through what they see as paradoxes of our politics or lack thereof, before concluding with their wisdom on what should be done about us.

2) 

Currently, the pundit class is waging a self-made war over appropriate emotional response to the anticipated suffering of Trump voters and individuals like me who share their communities.

3)

What this genre looks like is pundits who are almost universally men and almost exclusively white, firing off sleazy ideas about hillbillies while doing a very poor job differentiating between Trump voters and the average sort of disadvantaged person who lives in Appalachia or the Rust Belt.

4) 

Every generation of politicians, writers, analysts, academics and economists believes it has discovered something unique or horrible or paradoxical about Appalachia

5) 

liberal compulsion [is] to hold up the disadvantaged Appalachian or Rust Belter as a stand-in for all Trump voters while arguing above his head how much sympathy were allowed to have with him eliminates any productive exchange of resistance politics among progressives. 


So, I LEARNED NOTHING ABOUT APPALCHIA FROM THIS ARTICLE. NADA. ZILCH. Furthermore, the article only very superficially delves into "the media elites obsession with the 'hillbilly problem' " and fails to address why this is wrong (I agree it likely is and wanted to know how/why) based on any "insider insights" which the author presumably could give (since the author "lives here").

Take this gem for example:

The odiousness of this genres popularity is that it **eliminates any productive discussion of actual problems** by centering the real issue its authors have with the region: namely, that a fraction of the people in this country with repressive political views who look too much like them for comfort live here.

SO WHERE IS THE PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION? THAT'S WHY I FREAKING CLICKED TO READ YOUR ARTICLE. IN SEARCH OF IT. 

**tl;dr this article is a let down and really just a waste of time as it does not add anything to productive discussion of Appalachia. It merely whines that current media tropes are unfair.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> i'm copy-pasting my own comment from another thread, but *this* is what this refers to:

https://np.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/60mz0y/manafort_and_yanukovych_laundered_money_through/

I posted this to /r/ukrainianconflict, it's in Russian, but here a couple of the paragraphs:

The author of this investigation managed to obtain documents which confirm payments from Yanukovych to Manafort using off-shore jurisdictions and banks of dubious reputation.

The documents themselves point to the payments to Manafort being entailing money laundering and scams using payments systems; this is a criminal offence in the United States. 

Then follow a bunch of scans of documnets, quite a few in English. 

They are followed by this:

That is, according to documents, Manafort was not engaged in consulting Yanukovych, but in trade and the buyer of his goods was a Belize offshore company with an account in the Central Asian capital Bishkek. That is a rather non-common channel for laundering money, but sources have said that Kyrgyzstan was frequently used by the Party of Regions [Yanukovych's pro-Russian political party] for these goals. This country was chosen as it is on the periphery and has unstable leadership making it more difficult to investigate.  

"Computer sales" were the cover for these payments. 

 The contract for the sale of the computers is signed by Manafort himself. One can examine the authenticity of his signature by comparing it to signatures on documents available on the US Justic Ministry website. One must first look under the section for lobbyists in the interests of foreign clients (FARA) and find the registration documents for the Davis Manafort company. 

The article ends with this:

Now, after obtaining this Manafort contract, there are groundss to begin a criminal investigation in both Ukraine and in the United States. Since the "laundering" of money in Kyrgyzstan arrived on Manfort's account open in Wachovia Bank in the state of Virginia and the transaction itself was in American dollars, falling under the jurisdiction of the FBI. 

The author of these lines is prepared to give help in uncovering the schemes of corruption in which Yanukovych and his circles are participants. 

The fact that the payments to Manafort could contain a slow-ticking time-bomb was know to or suspected by Russian president Putin. In the autumn of last year, as reported in the dossier from the former special agent, Putin secretly met with ex-president Yanukovych to discuss eveidence f Paul Manafort receiving payments from the Party of Regions. 

"Yanukovuch assured Putin that there were no documented traces which would show payments to Manafort, though Putin told his circle that he did not believe the Ukrainian president", the dossier reads. 

As it turned out, Yanukovych lied again - but this time not to the Ukrainian people, but to his Kremlin protector.

<TEXT> i'm going to go way off on a tangent here, but this is fascinating. 

Someday "would of" is quite likely to become accepted. Spoken language moves faster than written language. 

I mean, there was likely a time when "don't" was seen as incorrect. (Except I think no-one cared back then) and proper 'would of' been "Do not". "Don't" simply being the "phoneticized version" of "do not". 

also, someday "couldn't" will shrink to "coon't" and later to "cunt". </TEXT>

That is, he knows, but is too afraid to risk making the decisions himself - perhaps because he once did something he 100% believed was right and it went really, really wrong?

Confess? yes, I've been manipulating you - "SEE, THERE YOU GO AGAIN!"

i mean, if bannon( ostensibly trump) can get the health care law labelled republican, they can primary in whomever they want as an "outsider" to replace "the corrupt GOP". It will play like "Make the GOP great again".

And Dems would have a helluva hard time compting against that. It's a damn good reason to be very fearful of the mid-term elections. 

There may well be a rout of the GOP establishment, but it very well could end happening because of a neo-Tea Party on steroids.  </TEXT>

Get groups of 12-18 good-looking (and at least 80% of them white) 19-22 year old young men and women. dress them up in white shirts and modest dresses and canvas that district door-to-door from now until election day politly asking people to think about why they vote the way they do.

Have pamphlets ready, maybe some feel-good TV spots. 

Set up a Super PAC to fund this "mission" and you know, there is a fair chance it could work.

But the message has to be taken door-to-door by true believers if there is to be any hope of converting these Mormons.

For the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, **$150,000,000** is hereby appropriated, to remain available until September 30, 2017: Provided, That such funds shall be available to the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, to provide assistance, **including training; equipment; lethal weapons of a defensive nature**; logistics support, supplies and services; sustainment; and intelligence support to the military and national security forces of Ukraine, and for replacement of any weapons or defensive articles provided to the Government of Ukraine from the inventory of the United States: </TEXT>

"We the people".

Now what is it that "We the people" are doing? Setting up a government.

So, really Reagan was correct. He said: "We the people are the problem". 

And now it is time to say "We the people are the solution".

<TEXT> thanks. 

on the spoiler thing, the way the page was moving for me when i clicked the link to your comment made it look like the link was opening to show the comment like some subs have so that people don't inadvertantly read spoilers. 

i have to admit it is interesting seeing America wake up to this. I live in Ukraine, so the moment Manafort - who has the reputation over here of enabling dictators - was in Trump's campaign, I was like "oh, it's clear what he is going to do there". Every time Maddow said "we really didn't know at the time why the campaign changed the platform/at the time it seemed there was no explanation", i was like "well, i know you're not following ukraine that closely, but yeah, i could have told you what to look for last summer".

now all i can say is thank god for christopher steele.

Also, I like how you did the "spoiler" thing. which reminds me, when does the real game of thrones start its season this year? I mean, I'm working under the assumption that the white house is doing what it's doing simply to keep us entertained until GoT returns. And then when we have the real GoT, they can take Washington back to being normal, right? *right?*

This is what needs to be part of a 50-state strategy. This needs to be used to tar and feather the GOP in red states (nd evry state) and the DNC needs to go after the GOP in every single damn election.

I mean it's like taking a knife to a gun fight, but both parties showed up to the fight with knives and the GOP gave the Dems a gun. 

Okay, Dems ... now just aim and fire. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, for example, Obama's experts developed a good approach to dealing *overall* with radical Islamic terrorism by adivsing to not call it that so that normal people practicing Islam do not feel the West is at war with them. 

Sort of like how in the US people are aginast the Westboro Baptist Church but no-one ever calls it Christian terrorism.

Now, while some may scoff at the idea and claim Islam has a specific undertone that leads MOST Muslims to believe things like a lower place for women in society, etc., etc., etc., it makes sense to not draw attention to that, because hey we can deal with what they actually believe later, right now let's do evrything we can to keep normal Muslims from becoming radicalized so they don't *do* something bad *right now*.

Do you disagree with this approach? Of course, I'm not claiming it stops all acts of terror, but I do believe it is a very sensible approach to dealing with the bigger issue and this contains the possible acts terror to a smaller community of Muslims who are radical, while allowing gradual discussion with the larger community. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *This is gloroius!*

bear in my that i am replying to a three month old account and here are my notes to his arguments:

1. The real questions is whether or not the hacking was "supposed" to have an effect and if Trump and the Russians colluded to that end. Maybe in the end it did or it didn't, but the story is intent.

2. Trump is stupid enough to not know he couldn't lift sanctions without s shitstorm and the Russians would be happy to see a shitstorm on top of getting the sanctions liftted. I mean, during the campaign, Trump apparently didn't even realize that the Russians had already annexed Crimea. 

3. So, we are to believe this posters "feeling" and his "I think it's safe to say"? Well **I** think it's safe to say that if there is anything there, they want to build an airtight case around it. See, now it's you say/I say. 

4. Yeah, they are rattled! It's so fun to watch them fret. They thought they were getting a deal and goddamit their partner is royally fucking it up. I'd rattle him too. Plus, have you read the news lately? A lot of Trump comapgn guys have been cught trying to hide the fact they talked so much to the Russians. You might want to read up on that...

5. again, you claim there is no evidence. well, fine, go ahead and claim that. in my opinion, you are just trying desperately to make that seemt true.

6. BOOM - the one that made me so want to reply. OF COURSE YOU BRING UP CLINTON. nuff said.

7. So, you're going to go with "Trump landslide" and ignore that in fact just a few score thousand votes got him the EV he needed? Remember where 548 had him before the Comey letter? You're jsut rewriting history here, though i'll give you credit for doing it in a way to get bernie-or-busters to suck up and believe you.

8. Again, it's simply your claim that their is no dirt when all the latest news is that *there is probably dirt* and *shouldn't we have an honest investigation to see if there is or is not dirt*?

<TEXT> Except that this has nothing to do with Trump and nothing to do with his being an isolationist.

FTA, it is clear this dates back a long time. 

The question goes before President Donald Trumps organization, going as far back as 2014. Poland, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus are not conceded without visa access to the United States. 

From other articles, it is clear Australia had the same problem, but fixed it in a timely manner. (The EU warned it could go down this path).

Why did Obama not reverse the discrimination against certain EU countries when the EU brought it to the USA's attention that they needed to fix it?

Now of course it is Trump's problem to deal with. But given his rhetoric, why would he change the USA's policy? The reason those countries are not allowed visa free travel is precisly because the USA suspects that nationals from these countries are likely to try to stay ilegally in the USA.

So, I in fact expect Trump to say "So? Fuck you, EU" and in return, start forcing nationals from all the other EU members to get viasa, too. So, if you are French, Italian, etc., Trump just might make you need a visa soon to visit the USA.

That was losing, but my point is that this has very little to do with Trump's actions.

<TEXT> It has nothing to do with Trump yet. Just wait until he finds out about it and Tweets as he takes a hard stance on the issue.

His core supporters sure don't care - who of them travels to Europe? So, he can tell the EU to fuck off; he hates the EU anyways.

Still, it's not quite a smoking gun. But goddam if it ain't some pretty harsh circumstantial evidence.

Also, for the record, I live in Ukraine and it's really, really hard ot say if giving Ukraine lethal weapons is a good idea or not.

Even furthermore, I bet Trump really didn't have any real understanding of the nuances re Ukraine/Russia/USA - someone just told him "go this route" and he did. </TEXT>

But whetther that reason is simply they knew about his ideas and change the platform to reflect that or Trump told them to change it, we don't learn from this article.

<TEXT> Thanks, that proves my point perfectly!

To wit:

because it was stabbed unaware, it didn't think to keep its momentum moving along with the car until it was too late

So, logically, while entangled in the seat belt, the Twin would have time to think -"Gee, maybe I should phaseout now. I'm conscious of this decision and can therefore keep my momentum. Imagonnadoit!"

Also, the wiki says "apparently they have to concentrate", and by using the word "apparently" the author is making it clear we don't really know. Consequently, we are free to entertain other possibilities such as the degree of concentration needed, etc.

Furthermore, the wiki disproves your assertion above that "If he ghosts, the car will keep going while he stays put." That needs a qualifier: "If he ghosts *as an immediate instinctual reaction and is unable to think about what he is doing before it is too late*, the car will keep going while he stays put." </TEXT>

 I'd get the superpower that lets you move effortlessly through all physical mediums with the precision that allows me to end up mere millimeters in front of a car seat and while materializing, my 'material essence' is also moving at the same speed as the car so I do not suffer from inertia upon my own full materialization.

<TEXT> Yours is an answer to a different question, however. 

In fact, you are saying "consult the news and then look deeper and form your own opinion".

The fellow I was replying to, is saying to avoid the MSM. I asked, if not the NYT, WaPo, or any number of "mainstream news outlets", then whom shoud one consult? In your answer, you did not narrow that down at all. You said "use the news" when the entire point is *whose news*?

I appreciate your trying to offer an honest answer, and hope you don't take this personally (because I ceratinly don't mean it personally, but in the context of the larger discussion), but at the same time, I hope you can see you did not answer the question at all. </TEXT>

As far as I can tell, the FBI will soon have its hands on Firtash.

This news really needs to his the top of /r/politics.

And that pro-Russia Ukrainian politician that is kind of sorta behind it is not a really big fish, he's a wanna be. 

Firtash is the real thing. He will know everythign about Manafort. He will know a lot of shit about any shady Russian or Ukrainian businessmen Trump has been dealing with. A FUCKING LOT. 

And he's a guy with a fuck ton of resources, so you can't just take him out that easily. If he dies anytime soon, that's a high level special op, if you ask me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Oh my god.**

**This is huge. Nay, yuuuuugomungous!**

Read [this Reuters article](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-austria-firtash-idUSBREA2C14V20140313) dated March 13, 2014 - weeks after Russia took over Crimea. See, Firtash was arrested in Austria on an **FBI Warrant**.

FTA: "It (Firtash's arrest) sends a strong message to Russia that the west is willing to go down the financial sanctions route unless it backtracks over Crimea and over broader policy towards Ukraine," said Timothy Ash of Standard Bank.

For a long time, Firtash fought very hard against Austria extraditing him to the US. He has deep pockets and can afford the best of lawyers. 

So, this news that NOW (what timing!!!) Austria is going to let the FBI have him is - just wow!

If you read the submitted article here, you will see that Firtash is caught for bribing Indian officials, but that's the hook. 

I can only imagine the songs he is going to start singing to the FBI because this dude is steeped fucking deep in Ukrainian-Russian corruption - especially anything to do with natural gas. And people in gas know people in oil.

He has conncetions at the VERY TOP. He knows everything about Russian gas deals (did I mention that already?). I DON'T KNOW THAT HE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THE 19.5% ROSNEFT DEAL, BUT I WOULD NOT FUCKING BE SURPRISED. 1000% SURE HE KNOWS PEOPLE WHO KNOW. 

I mean, I guess you can tell from how i'm going on and on that this is Really. Big. News.

<TEXT> This is not very true. The Nord Stream gas pipeline for example goes from Russia's north to the Baltic sea and on to Germany.  Map: https://gdb.rferl.org/C34C78F9-E7B2-496D-AD54-10CFDA62DF26_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg

Furthermore, *nothing* is being sent across Crimea. And in an age of sophisticated missiles, Crimea itself is not very important militarily (You'll have to read about that somewhere else, but the gist of things I read was that Crimea is good for projecting some naval force in the Black Sea, but not good for much else and that projecting force in the Black Sea is actually kind of weak in the big picture). 

Taking Crimea does however give Russia all the oil and gas fields in the sea surrounding it. Oil and gas deposits that were Ukraine's by right to develop and now Ukraine - which really needs more hydrocarbons had that stolen from them. 

Here's a map of what Ukraine lost de facto: http://www.platts.com/IM.Platts.Content/InsightAnalysis/NewsFeature/2014/NaturalGas/Ukraine-Crisis-Energy-Implications/images/crimea-oil-gas-assets.jpg

Here is a map of gas pipelines via Ukraine. You'll notice nothing traverses Crimea, just some branches go there to supply it:

https://www.zerich.com/images/articles/Ukrainyi.jpg

So, I personally think Putin took Crimea knowing full well it comes with offshore oil and gas fields (and that makes him even righer, though to be fair I think they are not devleoping those fields now as it is a legal minefield - International law recognizes the fields as Ukraine's and any company trying to devleop them would be hit with sanctions) and also he did it to bolster his declining popularity in Russia itself.

Ondoklassniki - an early Facebook socil media site like vKontakte, was really jumping on the Putin's failures meme parade in 2012-2013. That stopped when the war with Ukraine started and all those people upset with Putin suddenly became his fans.

<TEXT> No, my overview was overcourse superficial, of course they can do some off-shore drilling, but here is Russia itself saying they don't have the tech:

http://rbth.com/business/2015/09/28/russia_admits_lack_of_technologies_for_offshore_oil_production_49605.html

And it's caused serious delays:

http://upnorth.eu/the-impact-of-western-sanctions-on-the-russian-oil-sector/

Here are some other analysts:

http://www.offshore-technology.com/features/featurewhat-next-for-russias-offshore-oil-and-gas-4627639/

Andrew Neff, principal analyst at IHS Energy's petroleum sector risk group says: "Companies are not allowed under the sanctions to participate in projects and the Russians do not have the technological expertise [to do it themselves] and now they do not have the access to financing either, so for longer-term projects the time line is going to be extended even further.

"Russia would need to develop its own technology, which is doable but it is going to take a longer time. Western companies will enable Russia to proceed with these projects in a 10 - 15 year horizon and without that Western investment you are pushing that down another five years at least."

Both US and European Union (EU) sanctions will restrict Gazprom and Rosneft's access to world-leading offshore technology suppliers such Schlumberger and Halliburton.

and RPI, probably the leading indepedent oil gas research institute in Russia:

https://rogtecmagazine.com/rpi-offshore-field-development-in-russia-are-the-sanctions-an-opportunity-for-russian-companies-to-fill-the-void/

While in the drilling segment for relatively small depths there are drilling companies such as EDC or Gazprom Burenie, **the situation in terms of quality support of offshore drilling is very alarming**.

This article (from 21 September 2015) shows how much Russia relied on imported equipment before the sanctions:

http://www.rcinet.ca/eye-on-the-arctic/2015/09/21/sanctions-menace-offshore-oil-security-russia/

According to the newspaper, **68 percent of the technical equipment needed by the industry is now subjected to sanctions and consequently out of reach for the Russian drillmen**.

and also:

When it comes to shelf exploration, **Russia produces less than one percent of the equipment needed**, Kommersant [a heavyweight Russian business newspaper - my note] writes.

**Ha, I just realized you linked to a photo, too. (Hadn't looked at it first)** So, the Prirazlomnaya, eh? So funny, you'll have to read this:

http://barentsobserver.com/en/energy/2014/08/sanctions-could-jeopardize-security-russian-arctic-platform-26-08

The Prirazlomnaya platform is **packed with Norwegian technology** and is likely to soon feel the consequences of the western export ban on oil and gas equipment.

<TEXT> That is exactly it.

A little background. Russia's land-based oil fields are rapidly depleting. They have been producing on oil them since the Soviet days and they have the technology down pat. Tey are good at it, but the oil is running out. At least the oil they can access.  

But Russia has jillions of tons of oil (and gas) locked away off-shore in especially in the Arctic. They do not have the technology to drill for this oil. They just don't. They rely on western companies like NOV, Schlumberger, Halliburton - oil field service companies that DO have this technology. And they like to team up with huge Western companies that know how to use this technology.

Just before 2014 and all the shit Russia pulled in Ukraine, they were setting up big huge deals with companies like ... Exxon (ta-da!). Exxon would set up a joint venture with say Rosneft to drill for oil in the arctic.

These deals are - as you know - worth billions. 

Well, Russia fucked them up by annexing Crimea and the West asked "How can we really punish Russia for threatening the peaceful world order we have had since WWII?" *That* is the huge thing Russia did not get. Just how much the Europeans are willing to sacrifice to ensure the continent does not go to war again. And the rules state: "No annexing parts of other countries, just because you feel like you can get away with it when the opportunity arises". 

The answer was (after smaller sanctions at the beginning directed at individuals involved): "We will deny them access to our deep sea off shore drilling technologies and fracking technologies so they cannot make money off of selling oil. And of course, we must ban our companies from doing deals with Russia on these types of projects".

So, it's not even that Arctic drilling is not profitable for Russia, it's simply that they do not have the expertise to drill in those conditions. They do not make the equipment necessary and they can't really get it anywhere else, because it's almost a strictly Western expertise. India and China are trying, but they are years behind.

<TEXT> That was a very good explanation. I would just add that in addition to "moron from the Urals", there would also be "businessman from St. Petersburg" trying to letigimize his taking over ABC factory, too. 

Also, I think the comment you were replying to was just confused by the English as someone might see the word "recognizing" more in the context of "I did not recognize you when you came in wearing that big hat".

But you very good comment should probably be a top level comment, actually. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really wonder how the Republicans primaries are going to go down.

Either Trump goes down before them or he doesn't. Either way, his rabid supporters are going to still be around. So, how will they affect the primaries?

If they overrun the primaries and get lots of their rabid pro-Trump candidates on the ballot, how will that hurt/help the Democrts running against them?

Were I runnng the RNC, I'd making damn sure to rig the primaries so establishment friendly candidates get nominated as they *should* have  far easier time beating Dems in the election. 

But even if they are on the ballots, will ther be enough of a Dem/liberal uprising to swing the close gerrymandered districts?

<TEXT> It will come out eventually, but the very fact that people *suspect* the Russians hacked the RNC every single dam R senator and house member if wracking his brain wondering "fuck, what have i said in an e-mail that could come back to haunt me?" 

So, why would they want to press forward on an investigation that could be their end? it not only that they want to avoid an investigation to keep trump and the party alive, it's that they damn well know they've forwarded an e-mail where Michelle Obama is drawn as a monkey, or they replied to an aide that their adie's write up of some policy is perfect and the aide's policy paper is so not wha the R is know for publicly, or they wrote an e-mail telling their broker to buy whatever stock and that e-mail was sent during a hearing on some company whose stock rocketed the next day.

Marco Rubio was 100% right when he plead with Rs to stay away from this stuff.

And now is the perfect time for some Democrat to take the floor and flat out say "There needs to be an investigation into the possible Russian hacking of RNC e-mails. Now my esteemed colleagues have long been tough on digital security, arguing in favour of the government to be able to view electronic correspondence to secure the nation from threats. And that argument has long been 'if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear'. So, I ask my esteemed colleagues, what do you have to fear from an investigation? Why are you hiding from this?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest, everything is perfectly lined up to do this right now.

If you want to really push Net Neutrality, frame it in terms Trump's most ardent supporters can embrace.  

Why them? Because they hate the main stream media right now. Put together a few stories that can FW:FW:FW:FW across e-mail and Facebook letting them know that the "Deep State" wants to limit people's right to balanced news. Tell them that the deep state is pushing congressmen and senators - especially democrats (not true, but this will probably work better with a dash of "fake news")...

Like I was saying, tell them via chain e-mails and Facebook that the Democrats in cahoots with Hollywood nd the MSM want to limit what they can read on their Internets. 

These stories should point out that the evil libruls are infiltrating ISPs and when Net Neutrality is lost, the ISPs can begin offering "packages" of news where NYT, WaPo and CNN might be free, but you'll have to pay extra to read InfoWars or FoxNews.

Now you've got their attention and you can ELI5 on what Net Neutrality means for them. 

Next, get them (and others, we're not forgetting anyone else) firmly convinced that "No, the main stream media CANNOT be allowed to choose what "real Americans" hear and read and see on the Internet.

Finally, get them to plead on Twitter with realDonaldTrump to save them from this terrible possibility and BOOM Net Neutrality is a done deal - enshrined as a way for Real America to ensure that libruls don't brainwash the People of the USA.

<TEXT> Sorry, mate. That must have come across wrong. I'm entirely sympathetic to people who have not got a break. And I'm plenty aware that many such people live in cities.

Probably I should not have emphasized the "rural" voters. Basically, I'm trying to make the point that a lot of people have dreams - like say to visit the grand canyon travelling from somewhere east of the mississippi - which are completely *normal* dreams to have and they find them unattainable. 

and both dems and republicans are to blame for the fact so many people live paycheck to paycheck and can never quite achieve that vacation they are dreaming of. 

Or they just cannot afford that decent car they've always wanted - not even an expensive car, just a decent one say in the 12,000 range. 

Or they simply want to be able to afford to eat better. 

thos people have been left behind and Sanders tried to reach them and Trump did reach them. Many of them- I'm really not trying to paint in broad brush strokes.

and to tell the truth, i think it's probably easier to live on a farm with no other real resources than to live in the city without much in the way of resources.

<TEXT> To be frank, I fear you are wrong.

The facts are that neither the Rs or the Ds have accomplished anything in terms of improving BB's life. So, the fact that it is guaranteed under Trump to not improve in 4 years, does not mean BB will think "Gee, I guess the Ds were right, I'd better vote for them".

And the facts are that the rural voters you are talking about do in fact have a different reality. I'm not saying the facts are different, but they have a completely different views of things based on what they can observe in their own lives. 

Sure, they are uneducaed and influenced by alt-right TV and radio, but the fact is, Billy Bob has been living paycheck to paycheck for as long as he can remember - 8 years under Bush (R) and 8 under "Obummer" (D).

And he will tell you that you and I are in a state of perpetual outrage over things (like gender laws, Net Neutrality, voter intimidation etc) that are unconnected to (his) reality.

I mean there was a vignette on CNN I think where the Kentucky family or W Va family's biggest dream in life was to take the family to see the Grand Canyon.

Probably you and I would just save a bit here and there and then go. But we live in a different reality than them.

Trump of course is not the one to bridge that gap. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you need to add two numbers in your head like 53 and 87, start by adding the *tens* not the *ones*. You'll get there faster and it's easier.

5+8 = 13, so duh, that's 130 right there (easy to multiply by 10). Then 3+7 is another 10 and *woo-hoo* now you have got 140.

Now, you probably already do this in your head. You go to the store and buy four or five things, wonder if you have the cash on hand to buy it - don't tell me you add the *pennies* first, then the *dimes* and so on.

You don' do that, do you? 

So, then don't complain if they start teaching you kids how to do this in school. Yet a ton of people complain about "common core" and "new-fangled math". Dipshits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was brilliant. Thanks.

I do think he could have pressed even harder. He culd have put the question like this:

We know the White House learned that Flynn could be compromised by the Russians. Trump kept him on, because as you say Trump is loyal".

So, it appears to me that one of two things must be true:

The White House Counsel did not relay the information about Flynn being vulnerable to compromise to Trump, and so the president of the united states was unaware of this - excuse me - massively influential piece of information OR

Trump did get that information and decided to keep Flynn on anyhow.

Which of these two was it?

She could not have answered that question at all. lose-lose. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair, it does not. Personnally, I think this is simply as close as Trump could come to an actual ban on muslims without explicitly doing it.

So, sure, you can be technically correct.

But taken in the context of the election campaign and Guilani's admissions, it's clear Trump *wants* a Muslim ban. His supporters certainly do.

And that together with the fact that the EO was so poorly thought out makes it easy to label.

And the fuckers could have done it "right". Just let in anyone from those countries who *already* has a visa/green card and stop all interviews with anyone else. none going forward.

they really shot themselves in the foot with this by doing it like a bunch of amateurs. and it just looks stupid when they don't ban saudi arabia, too.

i mean, if you call a guy tey know is a terrorist, they start monitoring your calls, too, right?

so, were they aware when they recorded flynn's alking to the russians and able or willing to follow that up by immediately starting to record his other calls, too?

or did they only realize later they had his calls to the russian ambassador and miss the chacne to record him reporting to Bannon/Trump/anyone else that "It's okay guys, i've calmed the russians down about the latest sanctions."?

<TEXT> Here is my line of reasoning and questions:

if the IC was monitoring the calls of the Russian ambassador, this is no surprise. it's just part of spying.

so, in the course of monitoring, they find this citizen - flynn - violating the logan act. 

they get that on tape. 

so far, that is where we are. now i kick into "if i was the spy, what do i do next?"

since they have found a US citizen doing damage with the russians, do they get to now monitor all of his calls? i mean that's what they do, right? guy talks to known terrorist, he gets on the list of "suspicious types? right away and they start looking next at *his* contacts?

So, if they did then begin monitoring flynn's calls, do they have anyone on tape with him talking about the russian deal?

Like maybe they have him talking to someone and reporting on 
"how it went" as in "did you get an agreement with the russians?"

and if so, who the fuck is that guy?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> All the searches I've found point to the early Sierra releases, but I just installed 10.12.3 and my Dell U2713HM refuses to move from 1920x1080 to 2560x1440. 

Has the problem before with Mavericks, and it fixed with the "patch-edid.rb" installed in the home directory and setting the Dell to disable DDC/CI.

but this time none of that seems to be working. 

EDIT: Just to add that of course I backed up 10.9.5 before upgrading and so, rebooted on that to see if all was well. It was. 10.9.5 sees the monitor fine. 10.12.3 - does not.

Here's the funny part. When I rebooted back to my installed SSD with 10.12.3, I had left the monitor plugged in. And when it came up at 1080p *again*, I went to system prefs/displays to try to change and it would not toggled between "default for display" and "Scaled" at first, and then when it did scaled showed "2560x1440" - I swear it did - but the selection did not hold, it automatically went to the radio button "default for display", flickered, and when I went back to "scaled", 2560x1440 could not be seen.

EDIT: Did it again! don't know how - but here is proof: http://imgur.com/a/T8OmY As soon as I selected 2560x1440 though the window changed to giving NO resolutions at all. Unplugged the monitor and plugged it back in and back to step one. Seriously, why has Apple not fixed this?

Meanwhile, I am unable to access Utilities -  Terminal in safe mode, as the track pad refuses to respond. I even learned that in normal operations Control+F2 automatically wakes the menu and arrow keys can be used to navigate, but this appears to not be the case in safe more. Can anyone comment on that? </TEXT>

the past three decades have witnessed an explosion of new archaeological sources, and this has totally changed how we understand late antique / early medieval infrastructure, mobility, and lots of other aspects of social systems.

First, what are these sources? How were they discovered?
And how and what "totally changed"

What are specific (and hopefully eye-opening / colourful?) examples of "used to believe this" while "now we believe this"?

<TITLE> Bannon as a problem for Ukraine </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-14 09:06:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This dawned on me, and I wonder if I'm just way out there, or this is a real risk. 

the issue:

Bannon will continue to have Trump's ear in "strategy" and he is also know as a far-right racist. What are the chances that he will bend Trump's ear to convince him to meet regularly with a lot of far-right European politicians a la Le Pen? And that by letting these people be seen with the US president as a matter of fact, give them legitimacy and really further their prospects at home back in Europe?

Trump knows nothing about geopolitics and say Bannon invites a lot of euro-sceptic MPs to the White House, perhaps even including some that visit Crimea on a regular basis, what is that going to mean for Europea and by extension, Ukraine?

I'm not 100% on board with the idea that Russia is using Bannon directly, but goddam if they aren't happy right now.

And does a Trump/Zhirinovskiy photo op seem crazy now or possible? </TEXT>

<TITLE> How exactly did the elite during 1848 spring of nations decipher what was happening to their establishment? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-09 23:02:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I ask this in light of the current US election, Brexit, and other political events which often cite racism as the underlying reason, but it seems more and more to be an anti-establishment movement (perhaps poorly articulated by the people moving it who appear to be low-educated).

So, my question is this, if the 1848 spring of nations was anti-establishment as I think it was, how did the elite reason/explain it in their minds? Did they see it immediately as anti-them, or did they think there was some other unaddressed reason - I don't know "outside forces" or something?

I mean in Europe and as it was happening and immediately after. 

Side question - are there other, similar anti-establishment "revolutions" in world history in any place or time? </TEXT>

Other possibilities

[T_D melt] for comments posts from T_D

[alt-right] for meltdowns as articles/op-eds from alt-right media.

[pundit melts] Like if Hannity or some other "main stream" media figure has a meltdown 

[Trump family] for Trump jr melting down.

[Trump Himself] for the 3am tweets once he gets his Twitter back.

<TEXT> I suppose there was some kind of refugee programs that might have been unofficial or non-governmental - maybe church based? - before immigration laws became a big deal? Was there some kind of transition from that to a more government-sponsored/controlled and legal implementation?

I'm obviously thinking about the more recent times say post Enlightenment, but anything along the same lines that predates that is interesting too! Are there any good stories from antiquity or was refugee aid not really a thing back then? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, what makes a lack of depth vision a viable option in the thread of evolution?

EDIT: This has been of immense help! I think we are really onto something with the travel in pairs, echolocation and lasers angle.

Has anyone read any journals commenting specifically on cyclops travelling in pairs that may allude to devastion likely the results of lasers that was evidence in their trail?

I'm especially keen to know if there are any ancient Greek epics that might indirectly support this thesis, especially if the stories in those epics note that these roaming laser-wielding cyclops pairs were as active at night as in the day.

Point for discussion - do you think these "pairs" might have been actually threes, because then they could triangulate? And if you think this hypothesis plausible, what does that tell us about Cyclops' mating habits?

Could some kind soul who has a 2560x1440 monitor post an imgur of a screen shot of a maximized window (not full screen, but maximized) of how the Calendar looks in Sierra. I've google image searched but not found exactly that and kind of need one for some mock-ups 

If the kind soul is really super kind, I'd love shots in year, month week and day views, but just the month would be enough. Also, showing the sidebar on the left (can't remember if it slides to hidden or not, but I need to see that).

Also, any websites where you can download pdfs of schoolbooks for Slovene-speaking children to learn english, probably a little older, say children 7-8 years old.

Anyone know of any? Thanks!

EDIT: I'm loving these links below; they are going to be so helpful! Now, second question, are there any places where I can read along with audio/visual? (I'm giong through the links below, maybe some of them have that, but I'm too excited to not ask anyhow!)

<TEXT> Was just reading the Sicario 2 thread and a couple of people said they'd only want a sequel if Villeneuve was directing. So, innocent /r/movies guy that I am - meaning I really have no idea who this director is - I figured I'd let this bunch here recommend his movies to me. Maybe I've even already seen some others. Guessing here that that is likely. But I'm not even going to google to learn more - you all, not google,  are the movie recommendation gods.

Please feel free to go on and on about his and his work, but try to avoid spoilers. I'm fine with "Watch 'X' - you won't regret it" without knowing anymore when going in to watch. In fact, I probably wont' read nested comments if i think they are going to give something away.

<DATE> 2016-02-11 09:01:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Say I've got four types of content that all have similar fields. The content types might be A B C and D.

Each of these content types has the same fields (plus other not related to taking a quiz):

Symbol, Text, Value

I want to generate a random multiple-choice quiz, based on one of the content types. 

So, say the user chooses "category A", "quiz me on value"

Then the module should choose 10 random nodes of type A and pose questions like

1. A - node102

Choose the correct value: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4

The user chooses the correct answer, say "2" and the next question comes up and so on until the end of the quiz, after which the score is shown.

The choices for the answers must be pulled from the fields of nodes in category A. 

For example, say I have a quiz on US states. US state might be a content type and the fields might be "capital", "governor" and "shape"

So, the quiz must pull a random node like Delaware and if the user has chosen to quiz "governor", the choices must include Delaware's governor and three other governors of random states. (In other words, it's not a simple matter of set answers like if the quiz was about foods and the user had to recognize that a banana was a fruit and not a meat, veggie or dairy product, which would be a simple matter of randomizing the order of those four choices for each question.)

The "quiz" module does not seem to do this. Where can I find a solution?

Like the ones Europe votes to extend until March 2016, those are the Crimea sanctions right? What do they entail exactly?

I can hardly take part in most threads. I pretty much know nothing about movies except that I enjoy watching good ones. So, for example right now on the front page, I honestly don't know who Paul Feig is, or Alan Taylor or really anyone. And well yeah, I don't really care. But!

But, thanks to the extreme lurkability of this place, I've seen a ton of great films over the past year. We just watched 12 Anrgy Men last night and without /r/movies I'm sure it would have never been on the radar. 

Anyone else like me lurk? Let's hear it for the people who can and do contribute.

<TEXT> First, no, I do not have a lot of things on my desktop.

That said, I just noticed that when the dektop is visible and "Finder" is the active program, when I hit "a", the item on my desktop that starts with "a" gets selected. Wow!

If you hit a key that does not match the first letter of anything on the desktop, then the next one higher in the alphbet gets selected. (So, like if you have three items "a.png", DataForWork.xls, and "Nothing here" folder, then typing "b" would cause DataForWork to get selected.)

I've never noticed this before, but it is incredibly convenient!

This is on Mavericks, btw, but I suspect it's been the case for a while and is still true on Yose and higher. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have used this monitor in 2540x1440 resolution since October 2013 and yesterday for some reason, it decided (or my mid-2010 MPB decided) it was only good for 1080p TV resolution.

I've tried holding option when going to "Scaled" in Settings-Display, but that only gives me a max of 1600x1200, though I could swear i've seen 2540x1440 in there before when I had a similar problem maybe six months ago.

I'm using 10.9.5.

What gives? I really miss my great monitor...

EDIT ONE: After unplugging the cable from the monitor and mpb and waiting like a minute for it to cool off?? the scale demons to escape? When I pluugied it back in the 2560x1440 was there! BUT as I selected it, it disappeared and then there were NONE and then after closing settings and reopening them, back to square one. PROOF (I weep, I really want my resolution back! especially after cropping these in photoshop) http://imgur.com/a/H17Ha#0

<TEXT> Say I made a new taxonomy term and called it "holiday-tag", the default path is going to be "[term:vocabulary]/[term:name]" under Patterns. And so I add some terms and then decide the path would be better as simply "holidays/[term:name]". 

Is Delete Aliases where I reset the ones I've already made?

Or is Bulk Update there? But if it's Bulk Update, then why does it say "Select the types of un-aliased paths for which to generate URL aliases"? What if I want to change some already-aliased paths?

Also, how does this affect 404 results and consequently SEO? 

I'm afraid to use Delete Aliases, because it looks like it is not granular enough and I could delete a lot of aliases that are perfectly fine. And I supose I'd have to update them all individually. But maybe not?

So, what kind of corner have I backed myself into? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've browsed and all the quiz-type modules I've found seem to require actually entering answers.

An easy-to-understand example of what I want could be a quiz on the capitals of US states. 

So, say I have a contnt type "State" and that content type has a field "capital"

I want a module that will let the user choose from a set number of questions (10, 15, 20) and then populate a quiz so that the first question might be:

1. What is the capital of New York

a) Salt Lake City
b) Albany
c) Jefferson City
d) Springfield

the user clicks on his choice and 

if wrong, he gets the notificaiton "wrong" and the correct answer is highlighted and the question remains visible until he clicks on the correct answer and the quiz moves to the next question.

if correct, he gets the notification "correct" and when he clicks that he goes to the next question.

When generating a quiz, the questions are in a random order, and the answer choices also vary - just pulilng in the correct answer and three incorrect answers from the field in other nodes of the content type. 

OR is there a quiz for something like "How many sides does a triangle have?"

a) 3
b) 4
c) 5
d) 7

Where i can populate the choices with the correct answer and the incorrect choices from a list of letters/numbers/etc.?

Anything like one of those out there already? </TEXT>

It was given to me by a friend from Russia, so it might even be a knock-off. Has anyone ever seen one? I got it mid 1990s. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, I do really. If not for his stupid ideas to embrace Yanukovych in 2005 (what did he call those papers he signed? some grand sounding word...), and his continual fighting with Tymoshenko and his "vote against everyone" in the 2010 pres election, Yanukovych would never have become president.

I would say more about my feelings about Yushchenko, but that would violate this subreddit's rules on abusive language. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is an article from today's Vedomosti that caught my eye:

Deputies, Afghanistan vets and bikers will prtect Russia from a "Maydan"
http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/38310201/zaschita-ot-majdanov

         ,        

Deputies and senators have organized an "Anti-maydan" movement with the support of the patriotic part of society in order to counteract the threat of a color revolution both ideologically and physically.

Just wow - do they relly think there is a threat? Or are they just looking for a way to scare anyone from even thinking about it? Bizarre. </TEXT>
