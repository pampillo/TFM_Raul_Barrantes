<TEXT> No, Danimal, let's leave it at this:

You're more upset about the content of the poll than anything else, which tells me you're a Trump supporter.  Maybe not the howl-at-the-moon type, maybe a conservative Democrat.  Whatever.  The whole concept of "let's help Trump pass his tax cuts for the rich" is very telling.  Cut entitlements or raise import taxes?  So contempt for the poor and xenophobia.  And, your very limited sense of what a poll is tells you it's only right where we must include climate deniers and young Earthers.  I hate to break it to you, but it's not the 20th century anymore.

There are all matter of polls with various goals, rates of sampling, and question types.  I'm not here to teach you about all of that. But look Dan!  If you scroll all the way down to the bottom of the actual report, there's a link to "contact us".  let me link the report again so that this is not lost on you:

http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/tax-reforms

You can contact the Booth School of Business personally and tell them what's wrong with their poll and polling practices.  One bit of advice: make sure you spell "poll' correctly, or they may mistake your economic brilliance for something else. </TEXT>

It's a lovely narrative except people leave out how much the defense industry kicked money back to the GOP and how, despite the fairy tale of Reagonomics, that money is still outstanding in our ledgers, left for other people to pay off who weren't even alive for "the good times". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd add several more points.

1)  If this graph is supposed to show us that they do pay their fair share, then why should congress give them tax cuts?

2)  This is all based on personal income tax, but the corporate tax rate is 15%.  So, 15% is the share of the profits Comcast and Verizon pay to the government while they throttle your internet speeds and all of those other nice things that corporations do for the people.

3)  Look at other countries, especially the G20.  Are our tax rates low or high.  What about for the rich?  The answer is low and low.

http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-us-taxes-compare-internationally

4)  Should the rich pay less taxes?  Maybe we could rank along with these countries:

http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-countries-with-the-lowest-tax-rates-for-the-rich-379880/10/

5)  The uber-rich in our country are doing more than fine:

http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/09/20/does-the-u-s-tax-its-billionaires-less-than-other-rich-countries/

Not to mention that this top 1% is most likely to take their earnings and sit on them as wealth rather than put these funds back out into circulation.  It does little good for the country if the money simply disappears into coffers at the top.

6)  America has a long reputation for whining about taxes and tax cuts.  This continues to this day while the debt balloons to scary, catastrophic levels.  No one should be getting tax cuts.  And I already know: BUT BUT we need the tax cuts to get the economy going.  That BS has been claimed for fucking years, and where has the debt gone?  The economy is what it is, and that's cyclical.  Leave the economy out of it.  Taxes need to cover the federal budget.  They don't.  We don't need to be giving anyone tax cuts.  Do not believe the people who try to make it more complicated than that.

Now, do we need to raise taxes?  Sorry, but yes.  That's the adult answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Simple answer: It's about balancing the national budget.  Every year, the US government spends more money than it makes.

Extended answer:  The US government behaves very much the same way as someone with bad credit card habits.  They like to shop: the various government agencies need funding, programs ranging from research to financial aid need funding, and then things start to get juicy.  The government hires contractors for everything from defense to construction to cleaning up oil spills.  This money goes out to private companies and corporations who, in turn, make campaign donations to congressmen.  Unnecessary and/or wasteful spending done so for the sake of campaign contributions is known as "pork barrel spending".  Our congressional pork barrel is large and bipartisan.

That's my explanation of spending.  On the other side, we have income.  The government gets its money from taxing people.  Not just people, but businesses, merchandise, activities, etc...  There are all kinds of taxes on all kinds of things.  But all of those taxes do not add up to pay off our spending bill.  

This leaves congress with only a few options:

a)  They can raise taxes.  This has been known to anger the populace and get politicians voted out, especially in the land of Republicans.

b) They can cut spending.  This is typically the move where we have to ditch social programs because they don't pay back to campaigns like the pork barrel spending does.

c)  They can borrow.  Borrowing would be best described as taxing future Americans.  Someone's going to have to pay for this.  Just not now, and hopefully not us.  It's ugly, but it doesn't have that same immediate pain response that imposing new taxes does.

So, who benefits?  By far politicians.  Then come their political donors.  China has bought a lot of our debt, gambling on us being able to pay it back and enjoying the fees not unlike the credit card companies.

Why do we let them get away with it?  It's not as easy to address as other issues, because the solution is not a single issue.  Calls to kill the debt get answered with "OK, which programs to defund?  Oh, nvm, I'll decide which programs!"  For the last few decades, social welfare programs and defense spending are the perpetual yo-yo, but  that's never close to enough to put a dent in the debt, which continues to grow.

If we default, the results will be catastrophic in a way that makes 2008 look like a little oopsy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, well there's also the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.  

How did he create that if he was President?  Answer:  It's the signature piece of legislation passed under his leadership.

Raising the debt ceiling obviously was not his signature piece of legislation, but the increase was passed under his leadership and with his support.

Now, if you're serious and want to be taken seriously when talking free markets, give us a country whose model you think the US should emulate.

<TEXT> Do you mean traveling as constantly being on the road or traveling as living abroad?

I can't speak much for the first.

As for the second:

This may come as a surprise, but many many many jobs can be done in the living abroad format.

Teaching English is the most common one, and you can make some very decent money if you are a qualified teacher and work for international schools.

Chef is probably the second most common.  I know less about that, but chefs do get around.  Wonky hours, but good chefs fetch good salaries.

Cruise ship anything probably doesn't pay as well as you'd like in exchange for living in cramped quarters and serving finicky people.

Large hotel chains offer opportunities.

The gas and oil industries need people willing to work in far-flung places.

But, for example, say you're an engineer.  There are engineering projects all over the place and, if you work for a firm that serves thos places, you can go there.  Better yet, people with houses and families often do not want to be sent abroad, so you get extra pay for being willing to do so.

Engineering is just one example of the above.

State Department.

Airlines.

The merchant marine pays fabulous if you really wanna travel your ass off and stick with it as a career from a young age.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh this is ripe.

Yet in a survey of leading economists conducted by the University of Chicagos Booth School of Business, 92 percent agreed that the stimulus succeeded in reducing the jobless rate.

You're using a 2012 report not about Trump's tax cut but based on a poll of economists by the Booth School of Business to rubbish a 2017 Booth School of Business survey of economists about Trump's tax cut.

Try harder. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is all a very old and tired trope that, for reasons I don't why, Republicans have had far more success with.

They label liberals "tax and spend", spreading fear among the populace that Democrats will raise taxes. 

But there is a lesser known equal and opposite: "cut and borrow".  "Cut and borrow" defines Republican policy since (and including) Reagan.  The deficit is this abstract thing lurking above us all that the populace cares less about than higher taxes because the deficit has yet to come knocking in a meaningful way at the average American's door.

Before going on, let's try to be fair here.  Democrats often do raise taxes.  One reason is that they are trying to recover funds lost from previous Republican tax cuts.  The other, perhaps more important reason is that they believe in the social net and that we save more money by taking care of the poor and giving them better opportunities to better themselves than simply leaving poverty to fester and paying to house criminals in prisons (among other things).

Likewise, Republicans do raise taxes.  HW Bush did so after promising not to and was ravaged by conservatives.

Obama also raised the debt ceiling to avoid default post-2008.

Now, back to the program:  The latest Republican wrinkle is to claim that their cuts and spending will pay for themselves.  They did this under W by claiming the Iraq invasion would pay for itself.  Now, Donnie is going to cut taxes and have them pay for themselves.  Fool me once...Fool me twice...um, you can't fool me.

During his campaign, Mister T wailed on and on about our national debt.  He was the one to fix it.  Even if you indulge the infantile prospect that these tax cuts will pay for themselves, cutting taxes is not going to do anything to help the national debt, and these cut will raise the national debt when they end up not paying for themselves.

Old news.  New lip service. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This has now happened to me multiple times:

While waiting in the queue to enter a full continent, I flip through the various tabs like store, character, etc...  If I'm looking at implants and the "Warp to [Amerish or whatever]?" prompt comes up, I can't click on it because it's in a layer below the implants.  Everything else is also greyed out, so I can't switch to another tab or even log out.  I've tried esc, clicking on other programs and returning, but the only solution I have is to kill the whole game and relog.

Has anyone else encountered this?  Is it old, or a new thing due to the new implant system?  Any other workaround that didn't occur to me?  Does this suffice as a bug report?

Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, Berkely or somewhere coastal is one thing, but this is in Pence's back yard.  That speaks volumes for sentiment among the young towards this administration.

As for liberal bias:

a) as long as conservatives define themselves by rejecting science and promoting bigotry, then yes, it's hard for a university not to be seen as liberal by comparison.  Moreover, it's a bullshit middle ground fallacy to say that universities need to add more science deniers and bigots to their faculties in order to make universities 'fair and balanced'.

b) Remember the Oklahoma frat boys singing about lynching?  Universities are far from uniform in how liberal they are, and some campus populations are really anything but liberal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But polls are not perfect.  They do not record spite. They do not measure bitterness, deception, and selfishness.

TLDR: A bitter, spiteful, deceptive, and selfish U of Maryland journalism major uses Le Pen as an excuse to blame Sanders supporters for Clinton's loss.

I voted for Clinton (Well, tried to, tyvm electoral college), but if you supported Sanders and didn't vote for Clinton, then that's your prerogative.  The old Democrat strategy of pandering to the right is in peril.  That's a good thing.

20/20 hindsight tells me that we needed to elect Trump just to exorcise this demon from our system, just like Kerry's loss gave W full responsibility to own his war and the shitshow that accompanied it.  If Kerry had won, Democrats would be blamed for somehow screwing up the GOP's perfect plan for Iraq.  If Trump had lost, he might be gaining supporters right now talking trash at rallies about how he was the right choice to 'fix' America.  It seems quite right that he'd rather be doing that right now instead of demonstrating how unfit he is to govern.

And I do believe those emails did demonstrate that the DNC was throwing the match in favor of Clinton, so it's a bit hasty for Mr Thirst Turtle to summarily announce that Clinton didn't cheat in the primaries. </TEXT>

It's good to have a special someone, but if you try to hard to get into a relationship, you'll probably end up in a bad relationship.

<TEXT> Well, good luck with moving.  Start planning where and how to move now and manage your money carefully so that you can make that move long term.

Use your plan to move as motivation to take your studies seriously.

Also, remember there are things like the Peace Corps and Teach for America that might help you get out of there in ways other than simply moving.  A lot of people aren't so interested in Peace Corps or Teach for America because they don't pay, but they do pay to move you somewhere else so that you don't have to risk your own money, and both look great on job resumes.

Anyway, good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I learned that I said only a third of Americans have passports, then you said oh nonononono look at this yearly statistic which, when extrapolated, shows that only a third of Americans have passports.

Source: friends, family, working next to a military base in Korea.

Your "let's define" this group as the people naturalized in a given year a not, say, something intelligent like all the people who are first-generation citizens is convenient for your math magic, kind of like when I said a third of Americans have passports and you dazzled with data to confirm what I said in the first place.  And your word game about immigrants is just that.  In our country, when someone says "My grandfather was an immigrant", we all know what that means, mkay?

It's a strawman to use 100%, but, like not having universal healthcare, American employers give their employees among the stingiest amount of holidays in the West.  Oh yay, can't wait to play the "define the West" word game with you!

And as for labeling that bait, this is a thread about Americans and their grasp of geography.  Now, it's interesting that you think that universal healthcare has nothing to do with geography, but it does.  So does the number of vacation days you get per year.  But my guess is that you think geography means knowing where countries are on a map.  So, if you get a Master's degree in geography, you're really really good at finding them tricky places like Burkina Faso and Christmas Island.  

In any event, Gugu, that's more than enough time spent talking to you.  You can try to shoot down all of my points, but then all your left with is needing some other explanation for why certain Americans know jack about the world they are so readily willing to bomb.  So be my guest and come up with your own.

Or, try to argue the case that Americans do have a good grasp of geography.  Good luck with that.

Adios. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh good.  That's a lot of math to establish that only a third of Americans have passports.

And rules schmules.  Most American military get passports while they're at it.  Space A?  R R?  

And yes, if you ask who has a passport, no single group will be larger than recent immigrants.

And of course, those with the cash to hit the Caribbean for their 2 weeks off per year learn a lot more about geography than those who go to Mexico.

Fine, Caribbean or Mexico.  Then you're free to come back and wail about socialism and how our country will collapse if everyone has healthcare and support building a wall to keep out people from the places you just visited on your educational adventure.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I don't know how old you are, but let's just say that when you're old enough to travel, don't linger where you find yourself an oddity.  That might be in the next town, the next city, the next state, somewhere on the other side of the country, or somewhere else in the world.

If you're still in high school or younger, don't be fooled by thinking you're alone in that boat.  Just endure.

In both cases, I wouldn't say I found a place where I belong.  Instead, I bumped into people along the way who were more in line with my thinking. You really have to get to know someone before they'll actually tell you how they really feel about things because they're often playing along with the same charade as you are and won't let on that they feel differently until they know it's safe to talk about.  No place is a monolith of people who all think the same.

Follow your interests.  If everyone around you is the same, go fly a kite.  Kites are cool.  Kite people are cool.  That's just an example.  Go camping.  Go swimming.  Do some photography.  Draw.  You can share hobbies with people while you look for your tribe.

Trade loneliness for patience.  It's totally OK to be alone, not something to feel guilty about.  But be proactive.  Get out there rather than dwell on it.

Imagine you're someone like you.  How is that someone going to find you if you're not out there to encounter? </TEXT>

Thankfully, someone high up realized that them 24 million people wouldn't be able to pay taxes and deferred the plan until we can agree to one that kills a more fiscally prudent number of people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh yes, given that a passport lasts for ten years, the number issued in a given year tells us what about the total number?

Oh right, nothing.

Something like a third of Americans have passports.  If you look closer, a significant number of those who have passports do because they are military and need to deploy abroad.  The next biggest number are first-born immigrants who regularly traverse back to the countries they came from.

That leaves us with Joe Six Pack, and certain people love Joe Six Pack.  Why?  Because he's part of the 70% who haven't left the country.

And among this 70%, there is a serious percentage of people who, despite having never left the country, were hot-dog sure that universal healthcare, some scary socialist shit, was going to put America right in line with Lenin and Chairman Mao, this despite that every other developed country on the planet having universal healthcare.

They might actually believe that if they had passports and more than two weeks of vacation to travel somewhere other than Canada and Mexico. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The "legal grounds" for a country to do much beyond trade are virtually non-existent.

The WTO allows countries to sue for trade violations that might give them unfair advantages in imports and exports.  That's because WTO countries agree to be under their arbitration and you're not automatically allowed into the WTO.  China was allowed in despite their numerous dubious practices with dumping and respect for copyright/trademark.

When a country signs a treaty, it is not in any way legally binding internationally.  A) It's simply a sign of their commitment to whatever treaty B) It sets up a legacy back in their country of adhering to the treaty.  For example, NAFTA is a treaty agreed under Bill Clinton, but he agreed to it with the support of congress.  There is no international rule that says the US will face legal attacks for backing out of it, but Trump doesn't have the power himself to simply dump it without the support of congress.  If he had that support and did, though, Mexico and Canada would not be able to pursue the US on legal grounds.

The only other recourse is the UN, but that's not a legal forum.  You can get countries to agree to sanctions and such.

North Korea already faces a wall of sanctions, so there's not much happening there, either.

Not that I'm for it, but there's nothing that prevents NK from further nuclear development.

The important element of this is multilateralism vs unilateralism.

South Korea, Japan, and to a slightly lesser extent Russia and China are NK's neighbors.

If YOUR neighbor had a bomb in his basement that could blow up a whole city block, would you like someone in another city half the world away deciding for you that we can safely eliminate this bomb without you being caught in the blast radius?

What if your friends (Japan and South Korea) don't really want you to come "fix" this situation that they've dealt with for decades?

Moreover, what if the other neighbors (China and Russia) have missiles pointed at you?

As someone who's lived in Korea, I was very antsy when Kim Jong Il was diagnosed with cancer.  Why?  Because he might just be like "Fuck it, let's do this."  When power transferred peacefully, that was a good thing.

Now, however, my concern isn't about North Korea.  It's about a 70-year-old man with an eggshell ego frustrated by his treatment in the  press and possibly facing prosecution going "Aw fuck it.  Let's do this."

<TEXT> Well, personally, I did the first right as I was paying off student loans in 1997...and then my hogwan cheated me out of my severance pay.

I hated Korea.

Then, I came back with qualifications, got a much better job and the well-adjusted co-workers to go along with it.  I realized I didn't hate Korea as I initially thought.  My problem was with my employers.

Then, I went to the Middle East while still finishing my Master's.  I wasn't teaching anyone anything.  I was being paid to do crowd control.  This wasn't going to gel with my research about teacher observations.

So, I went back to my old job.  It's ALWAYS hard to be new at your old job, but I finished what I intended to accomplish and left Korea for maybe the last time in 2010.

1996-2010...The change in that time was astounding.  It went from no one really getting to travel to Koreans going everywhere and opening up to these foreign experiences.  The change was astoundingly good for such a short period of time.

What really changed far less was cowboy hagwons being corrupt and sketchy places to work, but that was all years behind me and had no impact on my own pleasant time there.

Mind you, Koreans are still probably the most intense, nationalistic group of people I've ever encountered.  They have a tenacity few can equal, and it's great when channeled in the right direction...

I'll leave it at that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Listen carefully.  You know those fancy kitchen sinks with spray washers built in?

For the price of a cup of coffee, you could get one of those added next to your bathroom toilet when you build a bathroom.

Now, this may sound weird, but have you ever cleaned your backside with one of those spray washers after a poo?  I thought it was weird at first, but it is INFINITELY more effective than rubbing your sphincter with some paper to clean it.  In fact, it is so much more effective that people where this is de rigeur absolutely despise coming to your country to study abroad and/or get better jobs if you can't properly kit out your toilets.

And pardon me for agreeing with them, but most of the G20 nations walk around with half-clean assholes.

And DO NOT, I repeat do not, come back with "Oh, so you want us to all have a bidet?"

A bidet is an excessively ridiculous addition to a bathroom akin to have a pre-toilet and a post-toilet.  

No no no.  Listen: sprayer hose!  Or, if you really want, I can accept the Japanese toilets with it all built in, BUT, that's still a bit gourmet compared to just having a friggin' hose/spray washer next to your toilet.

Even airports in these places have the hose there.  It's not too much to ask.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I see what you did there...

Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work because movies get remade all the time.

But let's work together to make this question work.

To be fair, you actually asked about "directors" redoing movies.  As often as we see remakes and reboots, a good director remaking another good director's movie is actually quite rare.

The best case of this happening IMHO was Terry Gilliam remaking Chris Marker's  amazing 1962 sci-fi short (before special effects) La Jetee as 12 Monkeys.

A bad example was Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho, which he shot faithfully scene-by-scene.

What we take away from this is, just like music, a successful cover has to "re-own" the original material.  You have to re-imagine it as something entirely new and absolutely depart from the original, which the corporate Hollywood remakes fail to do.

So, what director would I like to see "cover" a classic?

I'd like to see Christopher Nolan remake Citizen Kane.

Honorable mentions:

I'd like to see Quentin Tarantino remake The Five Deadly Venoms

I'd like to see Akira Kirosawa remake the Godfather set in the time of the Shogunate. 

And, just to really explore this topic, I'd like to see Clint Eastwood remake White Hunter Black Heart as a film about him directing one of his films. O.O

I immediately thought of those fearless men and their machines who would move your whole apartment across town for 20,000 won with the side panels down on back and your own sofa/piano/turtle boat lashed and towering over the vehicle at any height that could pass under a bridge, all the while grinding the hell out of the gearcase to make it up that mountain of a hill in Haebongchon/Itaewon/Kyong Lee Don.

<TEXT> I agree that it's a vast cumbersome system that doesn't work over night.  My primary issue, which I see again and again, is pointing to Watergate as some kind of estimate for how long this should take.  

Watergate and this current situation are apples and oranges aside from having a president in peril.  I'd note also that there were convictions long before Nixon went down.  Unlike Liddy and Hunt, we have people who have very likely committed perjury who are still governing in key positions and serving the White House.  That doesn't even require congressional committee investigations to prosecute, and that needs to be pursued posthaste. And, if the rationale is that the GOP can block these prosecutions, then they need to be pushed so that the GOP is on record as blocking these prosecutions.

They key difference between this and Watergate is that Watergate involved White House recordings that Nixon could not destroy, and half the prolonged legal battle was Nixon's effort to prevent the release of those recordings.  Under the current circumstances, everybody knows this investigation is happening, it is far easier to try to destroy evidence, and without White House recordings it's also far easier to coordinate a defense by allowing the defendants time to strategize.

Of course, none of us know what the FBI has, not to mention that the FBI in Watergate made great efforts to help Nixon.  The point is that I find it hard to believe that the FBI needs more time to investigate anything.  When the undercover element has been blown, you don't get much more than what you have.

Which brings us to the congressional investigation.  I don't really get what they have to "investigate" or how much time they need to investigate it.  So far, what they've needed time for was Nunes to try and derail the whole process and/or create a distraction.  If they had serious issues that demanded further investigation, they could take a load off by appointing a special prosecutor.  Instead, we have Republicans who aren't terribly interested in this going forward while they pass legislation and Democrats who, while they might be the closest thing to representing my politics in DC, have a long history of timidly not rocking the boat because they want to appear centrist.

So, on one hand you may have people expecting this to play out "like a TV drama", but on the other hand, you have people saying "just be patient" when I'm not so sure patience is actually on the side of those who want this to move forward.

Generals have a common flaw of treating a new war like it was the last war.  Patience was a winning strategy in the case of Watergate, but I'm not sure at all that patience is helpful right now.

<TEXT> I like how this has been repeated so often that it's now true.

As if there's some standard measure of time for a political corruption investigation.

Watergate lasted as long as it needed to.

The Starr investigation lasted as long as it needed to- 3 years for real estate investigations, then morphed into a completely different investigation that lasted little more than half a year.

I'm sure Bill would've loved to have played the "normal investigations last years" card and faced impeachment after his term was complete.

So, not that I know how long this will last, but the "takes years" bandwagon is basing their claim on very floopsy-flopsy reasoning. </TEXT>

Its independence is a critical aspect of the separations of power, and the Constitution empowers it to make rulings about what's constitutional and unconstitutional.  So, finger-pointing at the judicial branch of government doesn't cut the mustard, Mister.

Trump just attacked the Constitutional system of checks and balances, a system he apparently didn't know existed until around January 22nd of this year.  Comparatively, a group of highly intelligent people in the late 1700s foresaw the rise of a power-mongering turnip just like the one we have now and created the system of checks and balances specifically with this dictator-wannabe bullshit in mind.  

You wanna know what's really archaic?  It's not the Constitution.
  
It's expecting to be a monarch when you're elected president. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly.  The only reason they might appear extremely liberal is because of the paleoconservatives on the right.

This narrative of both parties becoming more extreme is a repetition of platitudes held over from some nostalgic but wholly untrue idea that the US population used to be unified before it suddenly became divided in the past decade.

Or, it's extreme if you think allowing same-sex marriage is extreme.  And if you're in that camp, you would've thought that letting black and white kids attend the same school was extreme back in another era (one of those mythical eras where everyone was unified).

Look no further than the G8 countries.  The only one that can out-conservative us is Russia, a de facto dictatorship.  You might say Japan is more conservative on certain issues, but the majority of the  G8 have political leadership that makes the US Democrat party look like middle-center if not slightly to the right.  Our liberals still wage war and carry out drone assassinations with a little more vim and vigor than our other G8 liberal parties, no?

I'll finish by saying that single-payer healthcare is neither socialist nor is it extreme.  Look at this:

https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/heres-a-map-of-the-countries-that-provide-universal-health-care-americas-still-not-on-it/259153/

You wouldn't think it possible, but Saudi Arabia is more progressive than the US.  And why is that?  It's because the true extremist party in America, the Republican Party, is holding our country back with outmoded thinking from the 20th century that is now long past its expiration date.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> April 2017: Best and Worst 1000 cert purchases </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-28 15:55:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Not as a new player, but as someone certing multiple toons, the 1k improvements are a bit of a blur compared to my first character (and now I wonder where the hell I got the certs to blow on all of that stuff the first time around).

So I ask what things you would prioritize as worth spending 1000 or around that on and what you should really leave as last.

Sorry if this has already come up as a topic, but my searches end up with info from 2013 or 2014.

And I'll offer a few ideas just to get things started.

NOTE: I'm trying to prioritize cert purchases and not DBC

1. C4-especially for medic who is otherwise gimped on offense against vehicles, gun emplacements, etc...

2. MAX weapons- Call me crazy, but it's kinda handy to do a bio-lab with default AI/AV, but specialized is better

3. The best weapons for MBT

4.  Maxing out rep for sunderers and engy ammo packs

5.  MAX kinetic armor

6. Having all engy turrets

7. Hover specs on air vehicles

Not worth it:

1. Maneuverability chassis 

2. Certain HEAT weapons that have been nerfed

3. Any and all class slots that are taken by something you plan to use a lot across builds/scenarios.

I'm really throwing my ideas out there just to generate discussion, so if I said something idiotic, I'm open to listening to those with more experience. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here's a secret:  Be proud of yourself in the same way you are of your family.

Do you ever walk around telling people your family is better than their families?  Good.  Don't.

Here's the history of our country:  White people didn't walk around keeping that to themselves.  They inflicted it upon others, especially blacks but they truly didn't discriminate terribly in who they discriminated against.  They inflicted it upon minorities far and wide.  I'm white, and this is no secret.

Now, certain other white Americans are offended by this.  They label it "white guilt".  Are you truly meant to feel responsible or guilty for our country's undeniable racist past?  Maybe neither "responsible" nor "guilty" are the right words.  What you should feel is ashamed at what happened and not want it to ever happen again.

Is this a unique situation, and does it only apply to white people?  No.  Modern Germany is a proud example of how a people have risen above their past but not forgotten what happened.  There are numerous other places and countries who have dealt with this less admirably.   Russia (vs their own Jewish population), Turkey (vs Armenians), and Japan (vs the Chinese and Koreans) are all prominent examples of countries with issues of national shame that they have yet to put behind them.  This doesn't even start to touch on unresolved issues in the Middle East and Africa.

The key here is resolved v unresolved issues.  Freeing black slaves still left them at a profound economic disadvantage, and their full freedom would not be attained until 100 years after they were "freed" and only 50 years before now.  And, we didn't magically start affording these people their rights one day in the 1960s.  On the contrary, it was a long, deadly, and painful campaign that the Civil Rights Movement eventually won.  And here is another undeniable truth: it was a campaign against white bigots.  Citizens, companies, and government.  Our country now officially and unofficially looks back at this in shame, as we should.

Now, as we collectively look back at this horrendously bigoted era in shame, does that mean you should feel guilty for being white?  The answer is no, provided it doesn't happen again.  Germans (aside from their despicable neo-nazi contingent) are still proud Germans who have many things to be rightly proud of both before and after the Nazis.  Does that mean they are no longer ashamed of the Nazis? No.  And so it's perfectly Ok for you to have your own personal pride in your ethnicity without that conflicting with also  being ashamed of our long racist past.  It's perfectly natural to do so.

The problem occurs among those who want to paint ethnicity as a binary either/or proposition.  You're either a proud white person who  ignores the racist history and demands to be free of what they term "guilt".  There's another flavor of this where they accept the racism but insist that ethnicities cannot and should not live together, which is another silly concept right out of the Dark Ages.  Then, I guess there's just an angry set who are angry that people say anything bad about white people and have no clue about history or much of anything.

Finally, we have the Whataboutists whipping themselves into a froth because these other ethnicities assert their own ethnic pride and feel that is unfair.  It will become unfair when the other ethnicities enslave whites, tell them to drink at their own drinking fountains, and refuse to hire white people because of their skin color.

And you do have the right in our country to contest your not being hired if you think the reason is that you are white.  That's a pretty rare situation in a country where it's still far more likely to be the other way around.

To get back to your question, it's not blasphemous to be proud of being white.  Still, those who would call it blasphemy typically have a lot more baggage than just that. 

I'd love to see a white pride parade that's about...I dunno, the Simpsons, the Office, and indie rock...than about bigotry in one of its 38 flavors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Open v narrow-mindedness

My parents had their reasons for certain attitudes, but I never faced the situations they faced.

That's the only way I excuse their positions on people of different colors, faiths, and lifestyles.  I cannot accept these same excuses for me.

Mine was the first generation to attend college.  That was a difference, but they only saw it in terms of jobs.  What had really happened is that I was homophobic and untraveled at the start, and by graduation I had been to other countries and had at least one friend come out.

They sacrificed greatly for me to have experiences they will never have.

I'm grateful, but I'm far beyond trying to persuade them that these "others" do not deserve the disrespect and contempt they offer. </TEXT>

-try something knew

-learn something new

-do something creative

-read something and finish reading it

-strategize about what to do next

-do something nice for others

-try something new

Honestly, I'm a bit of a loner.  I'm happy to do things with other people, but I'm not sure there's any good reason for anyone to be bored.

And I'm also not shy about pushing myself along with a little motivation:

FFS, imagine you were born in the Dark Ages.  Do you know about the Dark Ages and understand what they were?

For a thousand years, people tilled the soil, farming for their subsistence food and dying without modern medicine by the time they were 40.

I'm SO HAPPY I'm not living in hovel farming my next meal and hoping I make it through the winter.

Now, those people in the Dark Ages might have had all kinds of fantastic ideas about free time, but they had to spend their free time just surviving.

We have it sooooooo good.  Any waaaaaaaa about boredom should result in you being transported back through time so that you can grow some turnips and not have to worry about things like boredom. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a big difference between "do" v "behave".

In terms of do, children can teach a lot of adults about almost everything.

-Run around!

-Make stuff!

-Imagine stuff!

Personally, I doodle.  I didn't really do it so much when I was a kid, but it draws focus onto to something else other than all that other stuff.  People often frame meditation as something taught to you by a guru, but honestly I think 99% of adults meditate in one way or another without calling it meditation.

And then there's behave, which I still feel the need to mention.  Adults ARE children, just older children.  I'll restrict myself to three childish behaviors that I see commonly among adults:

-Take care of me

-But I don't want to do my chores

-X is bad because I'm good and I don't like it. Period </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for the in-depth reply.

OK, but case in point: burster.

Where do I read what a burster can damage?

Flak damages everything in the air, but nothing on the ground?  Except infantry?  Wait, it also damages harassers but not lightning on up?

I love sunderers, but I'm pretty sure a kobalt killed one of my sunderers.  Is a sunderer heavy or light?  What does a kobalt do to a MAX?  MAXes are a great illustration of the mystery I experience in knowing what is useful to hit them with or whether to ignore them.  My guess is that a MAX with kinetic armor doesn't care about a kobalt, but if I fire on a kinetic-armored MAX with a Ranger, he takes damage, right?  I would assume he does because he's not wearing flak armor.

I know I'm talking a lot about flak, but the Walker is equally confusing to me.  Again, it will shred any air vehicle but not any ground vehicle?  Walker v MAX?  Kinetic v Flak?

Do you see what I mean about wishing for a table?

I think there's a basic rule that works overall until you get to anti-air weaponry v ground targets.  I also see this with the turrets on facilities.  Again, you can hop in an anti-air turret and pound away at air targets.  While there are no air targets, you're free to take pot shots at infantry.  But sunderers?  I think no.  Tanks? No.  Flashes and Harassers?  Yes?  I'm not sure.

I always run a sundie with a basilisk on front simply because I know it damages everything.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a broader sense, is it not true for all of us in our own families that 70-year-olds are people who we need to take care of?  I mean, in general, are they not past their prime as family leaders and more the retired family leader?

If that's true for our families, why are we electing 70-year-olds to run the country?

Trump would be past mandatory retirement age if he were a civil servant.

He's calling Paul Ryan Ron and forgetting 90% of what he's said previously.

It's like dealing with my grandfather.  Oh, you always wanted to go sailing?  OK, let's do it!  Woohoo!

In this case, it's "You always wanted to be president?"  OK, you did it!  Woohoo!  Now what?  And then Gramps says "mission accomplished!  Let's hit the links..."

And then, it gets scarier.  I always wanted to run a war...

And let's remember: Reagan wanted to overturn rules so he could have a third term while he was completely out of it.

Personality disorder is one thing, but he's also suffering from a serious case of the natural and inevitable mental decay that happens when you're 70.

<TEXT> So I'm sadly and too often firing burster/ranger on air that sometimes turns out to be friendly...

But I seem to find it incredibly forgiving.  Given that flak explodes near targets, does our Planetside world have advanced flak that only detonates near enemy targets?

And while I'm at it, is there a wiki or some such that lists out what weapons affect what enemies?  You get the regular tip that small arms fire affects light vehicles, but in-game you also show red hits on things whether you damage them or not.

Running around, I've shot infantry with a burster (headshot even, I believe), but are MAXes immune to flak?  And along those lines, rather than read all of the weapon descriptions (especially vehicle weaponry), can I just read a table somewhere that shows what damages what? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Essentially, yes, that is one possibility.

Things are so far skewed from having this situation for over a hundred years that you would definitely not just suddenly inject 1000 new reps into the system, but that doesn't mean we do something more sane and moderate but better than one per 750k.

And then we have the party argument which is very much a parallel to the "we can't get rid of the electoral college" argument.  This is far easier to change than the electoral college, and if people give a crap about removing the apportionment act, then it becomes an issue.

Almost any talk about how to fix our government, including everything in this article, can be countered by "but the two parties won't support that" argument.

We've had decades of "the electoral college will never be removed", but as of this election, you have a seriously significant number of people who are ready to push for its removal.

Really, right now the biggest problem with canceling the apportionment act is that almost no one even knows about it.

So I emplore you: Decide for yourself whether it's a good idea or not (it's a bipartisan issue) and, rather than saying it will never happen, tell people about it.

<TEXT> I've lived in both China and South Korea (as well as Taiwan, for that matter), so let me try to answer your question, which is a very complicated one.

In the world of communism, China is Maoist whereas North Korea is Stalinist.  There is and always has been a serious divide between these two schools.  China didn't get along with the Soviet Union despite being communist, North Korea was closer aligned with the Soviets than China, and China got involved in the Korean War more as a defensive measure on their own part than to save North Korea (MacArthur is to blame for their participation, but that's another story).

As such, despite what many people far removed might think, China isn't exactly happy about having their crazy neighbor, and Chinese look down on North Korea in much the same way the West does.

Do they want a united Korea?  As much as I know, I couldn't definitively answer that question.  They would be none too happy about US forces stationed in a united Korea, but they would also stand to benefit in the long term if Korea followed the path of Germany after it was reunified, meaning a long tough term for South Korea (that actually many in SK oppose because of the economic hardship involved) that would ultimately result in a powerful trade partner minus the poor economic migrants they have to deal with now fleeing North Korea as they have done for generations.

In our contemporary perspective, people like to dwell on the nuclear threat of North Korea, but the fact is that North Korea didn't get invaded and overthrown for a good 50 years before they had nukes.

So, why didn't someone just invade them a long time ago?

a) You have wider geopolitical tensions than just Korea.  You're in the backyard of both China and Russia.

b) If you look at a map, South Korea's capital, Seoul, is pretty much on the border with North Korea.  It has close to 20 million people living in the shadow of North Korea.  North Korea has thousands, more like tens of thousands, of artillery pointed at every single square inch of Seoul.  Soldiers and expats have nicknamed it the Kill Box because you're pretty much dead if you're in the Kill Box when war breaks out.

So, when you talk about the result of overthrowing Kim Jong Un, the first result that comes to question is who and how many people will die in the process.

NK would probably mercilessly strike Seoul if they were attacked, and it is highly questionable as to whether US forces or otherwise would be able to act so swiftly that they could prevent this.  People like to dream of the last war, and Seoul is not Baghdad.  Things will not play out the same as when Saddam's troops dropped everything and fled.  Don't get me wrong, NK troops might do that, but will they do that before they fire all of the artillery that's sitting there right now loaded and ready to pop off essentially at the push of a button?

While it's very likely that NK wouldn't hit South Korea with a nuke, they hold zero love for the Japanese.  It might be questionable whether they can hit US territory (Hawaii being the most likely target), but their horrible misfiring weaponry is two feet away from Japan.  Without missile defense and cyber whatnot, if they just wanted to hit Japan, they could.

So, the game Mr Trump is playing now is very high stakes.  Attacking North Korea is gambling on preventing them firing a nuke AND preventing their artillery from laying Seoul to waste.  There's no redo if you screw that up.

Now, say they pull it off.  Bam bam.  No nuke, no artillery.  Does that mean Kim Jong Un is overthrown?  Uh, maybe, but that leaves a vacuum there.  The US cannot invade NK from South Korea.  The border is basically one big land mine.  Meanwhile, China can walk right in.

As someone else mentioned, they might accept a unified South Korea without US forces there, but they might just hold North Korea until they see that US forces have left.

Does the US plan to leave Korea, their major stronghold in Asia?  They would if the South told them to leave, but they won't just pack it up otherwise.

So, now you have a whole new problem with a Chinese-occupied North Korea directly bordering a US-occupied South Korea, and that's only if all of this goes off without a nuke being detonated and Seoul being destroyed.

In my experience, people who live a million miles away from all of this are far more giddy to see what happens than the people on the ground there who might die.

I'm sure neither South Korea nor Japan has told Trump they want him to go sort this out for them, and anybody eager to get the war on should be careful what they wish for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand what you're saying, but I don't accept the "one-shot" narrative.

Sessions perjured himself.  Do we need secret FBI info about that?  No.  He did it in public.

Kushner failed to disclose his Russian contacts during his process to get security clearance.  Do we know that?  Yes.  This isn't about something that happened last fall.  It happened right now and we know it happened.

Should we be concerned that, if we charge Sessions or Kushner, some critical info from June to November might be lost or destroyed?  No, they would have already done so.

Should we not prosecute them because they're being secretly investigated and might reveal some further info?  No.  They know they're being investigated.

And what kind of country do we have if people who should be prosecuted are, in the meantime, arguing further legal issues and going on visits representing the White House?

This has nothing to do with the longer investigation.  It's like if I murdered someone in January on tape, but there was another murder last summer by my friends, then I shouldn't be arrested until the investigation of my friends is complete, and we should treat it all as one crime.  No.

Crimes have been committed, and the people who committed them are not just walking the street, they're functioning as part of and representing our government.

Bullshit.  If you committed perjury, you don't simply get to recuse yourself from one investigation and go on serving as attorney general.  You get removed and stand trial.

If this is another Democrat boohoo-the-GOP-is-in-charge moment, then the entire Democrat party can stand down and we'll let the ACLU represent us in congress. 

The Democrats get no slack here.  There are less than ten of them agitating while the rest just sit and watch.

If they have principles that the GOP lacks, and that's not some done deal just because the GOP sucks, then they need to be doing everything possible right now to commence prosecution.  </TEXT>

If we will have an independent commission, we would have had one already.

While I appreciate that it took years to impeach Nixon, this is 2017 and the person in charge is readying a nuclear confrontation.

I can't buy that Jeff Sessions is still in a government role while he committed perjury.

I can't buy that Jared Kushner lied to get his security clearance and is just sitting there conducting business as usual.

This umbrella has grown too large and it's still growing.

Maybe, just maybe, "Russia collusion" needs to be subdivided into multiple investigations with Flynn going to jail right now and the Trump himself connections ongoing.

Have we seen enough evidence for serious charges to be brought against certain people?  Yes.  Then bring them.

And why exactly are we not bringing them?  Because the investigation is incomplete?  Well, all of these "suspects" know damn well what's going on and have had ample time to hide/destroy whatever it is they might try to.

The investigation is complete on numerous fronts, and there is no good reason to not pursue these legally and criminally right now.  Right now before more bullshit is attempted by those who will stand accused.  Right now rather than establishing a commission that will draw this out until 2020.

<TEXT> I just went and watched footage, and that was a total shitshow.  Both sides at one point or another wanted/provoked/sough out violent physical confrontations, and it was all a sad rip-off of British soccer hooliganism.

It actually took me along time to figure out who was who.  Are the proud boys the ones dressed in black with face masks who look a lot like the new ninja branch of the KKK?  No, those are the "good guys"...  Actually, the proud boys are the ones who look like WWE fans that overthrew comic con.

So, on one side we have a new virulent strain of white nationalist idiocy along with a bunch of impressionable youth who think that's cool.  On the other, we have "Antifa", essentially the shit-stirrers who for the last two decades or so inevitably exploit peaceful protests to trash a McDonald's and overturn a car along with a bunch of impressionable youth who think that's cool.

My real question is where the hell the police are while this turd of a showdown is blossoming.  They seem to be over standing in a park with their riot gear waiting until they can punch the clock and go home.  And seriously, did they erect two snow fences 7 feet apart to separate the two protests?  WTF, they might as well be handing out booze and brass knuckles.  Your typical Klan/anti-Klan protest arrangement separates the two groups by a significant distance, at least a block, with the police in between.  Berkeley PD have to be at least partly liable for that whole scene to the point of saying they failed to do their jobs.

On the other hand, there is some seriously disgusting shit on Youtube with video and commentary that makes those who appear in said videos criminally liable.  Video of people being sucker punched, and one video of a guy with a spiked ring saying he's going to use it to crack some Antifa skulls. Google should be liable for allowing some of that to be hosted on their site.

tldr- That was a contest to see which Americans are bigger idiots than our president, and everybody won.  

I hope they get tired of winning, but nobody looked tired in the videos I saw.

I have to admit I had done some spice shopping before I could make this:

http://www.food.com/recipe/easy-crock-pot-moroccan-chicken-chickpea-and-apricot-tagine-137530

That all said:

-I almost always look at multiple recipe sites and combine, edit, and/or delete ingredients based on what I have and what I like

-I am seldom deterred if I'm missing one of the seasoning ingredients.  Don't have ginger root?  You'll probably find another version of the recipe that doesn't have it.  

-Unlike youtube, this is the perfect time to read the comments sections.  These are filled with people who tried the recipes and very often how they would or did tweak the recipe.

-Within reason, be imaginative.  I wanted to make a meatless version of that chili, but I wasn't sure what kind of "chunkiness" would be a suitable replacement.  Then I saw a can of pineapple.  Hmmm...Do I like pineapple?  Oh yeah.  Would it taste good in chili?  Yes, I think so.  Went for it, and while I was waiting for it to cook, I looked online and found that Hawaiians love them some chili and of course put pineapple in it.  This one won a major chili cook-off:

http://www.mauichili.com/

and when you look at the ingredients:

<TEXT> I'd say that's overthinking it.  If that logic applied, then the same could said in the opposite way:  having the early California returns would crush the spirit of Republican voters elsewhere.

It's sad that the most easily manipulated people (swing voters, people who let the media tell them who to vote for) seem to decide our national contests, but anyone with a half-functioning brain shouldn't be particularly influenced by seeing California won by the Dem contender or think that the popular vote is any reason to not vote.

Honestly, I really don't think there are people sitting at home the day before election day thinking, "Do I vote or not?"

a) In most places, you had to register beforehand.

b) I can't emphasize enough how many people who are eligible to vote choose not to because of the crappy candidates that get fielded. </TEXT>

http://www.crock-pot.com/slow-cookers/crock-pot-6-quart-slow-cooker-with-stovetop-safe-cooking-pot/SCCPVI600-S.html

That let's you use it like a frying pan/roasting pan.

I personally figure out the order which is best for my ingredients and keep adding as I go.  I almost always sautee onions first because they tend to carmelize rather than burn.  Then, I'll throw in cumin seeds, cardamon pods, and maybe some curry leaves.  After that, the meat (I do a rub before cooking) goes in to get browned.  About this time is also when the garlic goes in because I don't want to burn it.

I guess if you're a pro, you could cook each of the above and then remove it temporarily to a bowl before combining, but that's another dish.

Once the meat is done, now it's time to take this off the stove and move it to the slow cooker where the liquid ingredients get added along with garam masala and/or whatever spice combo you prefer.

Do this at noon.  Come back at 6 or 8 and there it is.  If you have freezer space, you have a week of curry for one person.  If you don't, you have enough to share with friends.  </TEXT>

Mother Jones on Breitbart http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/11/steve-bannon-racist-lets-find-out:

The online publication has been criticized for incendiary articles, such as one that warns of "Muslim invaders" and another that dubs conservative thinker Bill Kristol a "Renegade Jew." One headline offered this fix for online harassment: "women should log off."  

There are many things that separate the alternative right from old-school racist skinheads (to whom they are often idiotically compared), but one thing stands out above all else: intelligence. Skinheads, by and large, are low-information, low-IQ thugs driven by the thrill of violence and tribal hatred. The alternative right are a much smarter group of people  which perhaps suggests why the Left hates them so much. Theyre dangerously bright.

And, seriously, asking which Youtube comments section is the dumbest is like asking which middle school kid is the dumbest.

They're all the dumbest.

But if you really want me to try to answer your question, the dumbest Youtube comments sections are the ones where 40-year-old men still talk like they're still in a middle school lunch room.

That happens all over, but it happens most with politics.

The dumbest youtube comments section is whichever is most similar to the dumbest subreddit, and that's the one with little boys of all ages fantasizing about being president. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm...I think the author is trying to look historically at the first 100 while ignoring the incredible significance of THIS first 100.

Trump has:

-appointed a billionaire cabinet

-placed people with clear white supremacist ties high in his administration

-appointed a series of individuals to head agencies they hate

-ignored obvious conflict-of-interest issues by using his business for government functions and pursued business with foreign countries

-attacked a sovereign country in a case that was not self-defense

-assailed the judicial branch of the US government for not doing his bidding

-assailed the legislative branch for not doing his bidding

-run afoul of constitutional checks and balances in doing both of the above

-failed to find support for signature legislation more than once

-mishandled issues of state secrecy by conducting foreign policy at his Florida resort

-engaged in what is probably nepotism by appointing his daughter and her husband to ambiguous administrative positions

-lied, lied, and lied some more on Twitter, on camera, and on record

-been embroiled in what is probably the greatest political scandal the USA has ever seen 

SO...no, let's not talk Trump.

Let's talk Politico.

YOU are running an article about how the first 100 days is "bogus" when we have never seen a 100 days like this one EVER.

Two words:  FUCK YOU.

Now, is it that you feel the need to dance around the middle?  Is that what you're doing by playing down the last 100 days of destruction?

OK, then let me humor this for just one moment.  If you're trying to be bipartisan, how about you present this issue as a point/counterpoint article so that someone who hasn't been in a coma since January has a chance to point out how decidedly un-bogus it is to weigh the rape of our national government against the tool you have talking about it in surfer-dude terminology?

Might it just be possible that this is journalistically the wrongest time ever to write off the first 100 days of a presidency as bogus? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Short answer:  When I turned 23, I realized I was as close to 16 as I was to 30.

A fun one for most people here: 9/11 happened in 2001.  We are now 16 years removed from that moment.  Going backwards, we are as far removed from 9/11 as people were in 1985, when it was still 16 years in the future.  O.O

Long answer:

I started to feel old when pop/rock stars were younger than me.  There was a time when they were always older.

Then, I was the same age as most pro athletes.  Say 24 or 25.

Then, I was older than my idols were when they had achieved such great things.  The Beatles had written their canon by age 27.  So had Dylan.  So had so many more.

Then, I was more interested in what movie stars were actually my age but I'd never paid attention to their age before.

By 30, you have some "young" authors around your age.  For me, Eggers and Palahniuk.

In your 30s, there's a whole range of people who will start innovating and creating businesses.  Mark Cuban comes to mind, but it was that whole dotcom explosion.

Then you hit 40 and things become more sinister.  The politicians... I'm in the same age bracket as Ted Cruz, Rubio, and Paul Ryan.  People my age are running for high office.  Damn.  And most of them I thoroughly despise.

But you hold out hope for yourself.  Too late to start that punk band.  Probably not going to be a business dude.  Back to authors.  Yes!  I'm still young enough to write that novel.

Right around this point, a fair number of the rock stars your age have faded or died and the last pro athletes around your age are retiring.

I won't go into how your body doesn't tolerate the sludge you put into it anymore, encountering wee ones too young to give a rat's ass about either Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, or starting to babble about 8-track players, smoking on airplanes, or how everyone in one house had to agree about what to watch on TV. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to agree.  

The wall to the world of cooking for me was a) not wanting to make a pile of dirty dishes and b) not knowing jack about cooking and assuming it would take years to figure out how to make things taste yummy.

Putting all of your ingredients in one pot is a good way not to make a massive clean-up detail later and slow cooking is the ultimate cheat sheet for good grub.  If you don't know what you're doing, flavors synthesize over hours of cooking and you're free to taste here and there over hours to balance out the flavor.  Try it, and then invest in a wider range of spices.

Chili is probably the best place to start.  If you don't like spicy food, fine, evolve your chili into the non-spicy realms.

Indian food seemed like something you need a guru to have a hope of making well, but a little research and 8 hours of slow cooking yielded something I made myself that I can't differentiate from a restaurant.

And holy internet, Batman.  There were days when recipes were things people put in a box.  It's all sitting out there waiting for you. 

Just be sure to sautee your onions (you can get a slow-cooker that will do that right around the $50 mark). </TEXT>

<TEXT> tldr: citizens can get the anti-corruption act (a series of measures to limit big money donations and tactics) on local ballots.  These local actions then pave the way for passing the anti-corruption act at state level, affecting all candidates in states where it is enacted.  Momentum can then spread to DC and national politics.  Keeping this effort bipartisan is pivotal to its success.

I went into that very cynical and not liking the cartoonish aspect.

<TEXT> There's something about no investigation revelations within a 90-day period before the election.

Then again, I don't know how that jives with the releases on Hillary.

Then then again, I believe I know about the 90-day rule because people jumped on Comey for his revelations.

With 20/20 hindsight. I think where we are now is probably better than the shitstorm that would've erupted if this had been brought out in the middle of the election.

They dished on Hillary but not Trump.  You cannot now argue that the whole thing was biased or unfair towards Trump.  If anything, it was biased in his favor.

Moreover, my guess is that Trump knew about all of this during the election.  That's why he resisted getting intelligence briefings while a candidate.  That's why he immediately went over to intelligence headquarters when he was inaugurated and got his "standing ovation": he was hoping against hope to hit some kind of reset button that would've buried the past.  That's why he freaked out when Sessions recused himself because he needed the Attorney General to leverage this whole debacle in his favor.

And, if the NSA/FBI misbehaved in any way, it's not too late to take them to task in a separate investigation.

Hopefully, that will be just one part of how we fix things so that this never happens again.  The silver lining of the Trump fiasco is that it's shown so many weaknesses in how our system works.  They were going to be there until someone came to test all the loopholes.

Thanks, Donnie.

<TEXT> Bring your own food, but it's more fun and interactive than air travel.

Easier to talk to other passengers.  You get a greater appreciation for the vast spaces out there.

The trains connecting the midwest to the west (Southwest Chief and California Zephyr) are, IMO, the best experience.  Chugging across the plains for what seems like forever and then, holy crap, what's that?  The Rockies!  I never get tired of that.

The euro train experience is better with the compartments, but Amtrak is still fun.  If you have to keep doing the same route I can see how it's less fun, but any travel is better than never traveling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The difference is that you don't get to see the Fox and talk radio communities, whereas on social media you get to see these people in all their glory.

Look at Reddit and r/t_d.  I'd argue that the opposite of polarization is occurring overall.  Maybe for some non-bigoted, non-corrupt, non-crazy reason (can't think of one offhand, but humor me) you think you like Trump.  All you need to do is go to t_d and look around for three minutes.  Then any sane person will ask themself, do I want to be a part of or even associated with this happy crap?  No.

Sure, social media is polarizing in that the far right can get together and meet one another, but it unifies more people than it pushes in these directions.  That's a far less sexy story than OMG the USA is split right down the middle.

It is indeed split but more convergent than divergent. </TEXT>

From an early date, rhinoceros horn was believed to have special properties, in particular that it would react by fizzing if it came into contact with poison, and so cups made out of rhinoceros horn were valued as a protection against poisoning.[5] It is thought that rhinoceros horn cups developed during the Warring States Period or earlier,[20] and rhinoceros cups (Chinese sgng ) feature prominently in pre-Han literature; they are, for example, mentioned in four of the 300 odes of the Book of Songs (nos. 3, 154, 215 and 292).[12]

Now, before you start waving your hand to save face and defend your lying, how about this:  You grab a pen and write a letter to Nature, National Geographic, or the Atlantic and dazzle them with your evidence, which you have none other than waving your hand.  These are highly reputable journalistic sources and will be happy to print a retraction if you have anything to back up your...alternative facts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, so it's not used in Chinese medicine "as an aphrodisiac".  That's convenient cover to suggest it's all recent Vietnam misinformation from the Western media when it is very very very well-documented that rhino horns were used for hundreds if not thousands of years in Chinese medicine.

Though rhino horn elixirs for fevers and liver problems were first prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine more than 1,800 years ago

https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/05/why-does-a-rhino-horn-cost-300-000-because-vietnam-thinks-it-cures-cancer-and-hangovers/275881/

Rhino horn has been an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries.

http://www.rhinoremedy.org/medicine/point-less-rhinos

Rhino horn is a time-honored component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). For thousands of years, TCM has credited rhino horn with the potency to cure an unusually wide array of maladies, from headaches to pus-filled boilsand even devil possession.

<TEXT> OK, TTheorem's point stands.  She's not said Assad is good, and has stated that he should be executed if found responsible for the chemical attacks.

It's easy to misinterpret someone who flies to meet with Assad and then says she doesn't think he's the source of the chemical attacks, but if you read her actual statements about all of this as well as look at her politics, she is not right-wing at all.

-Supports reinstating Glass-Steagull to combat big banks

-Recipient of a Sierra Club award for the environment

-Pro-abortion

-Pro-medicare expansion

-Pro-LGBTQ, saying we don't live in a theocracy

She met with Trump early to push her agenda about Syria.  She's not a neocon in any way, shape, or form.

Thanks, TTheorem. </TEXT>

I'd even go so far as to say there were troop leaders who ran scouts without the paleoconservative dogma, but BSA as a national organization is mentally alseep at the wheel and morally straight only when the entire rest of society has already moved ahead and prods them, kicking and screaming, to do what's morally straight and end their chauvinist bigotry.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People like to talk about themselves.  If you don't know what to say, ask someone about themselves-preferably calmly and coolly, not in a nervous twitchy fashion-and whatever they say, pretend it's really interesting and ask them to tell you more INSTEAD of starting to talk about you.

Remember SMOOFF

Situation- So how long have you known [party host] for?  How'd you meet?

Motivation-  What brings you to this [frat party/clambake/open mic session]?

Opinion- So whaddaya think about this music?  Really?  Then a) So what would you put on instead?  or b) If you like this one, then what else do like along these lines?

Occupation- obvious, maybe better if you're older

Family- obvious, maybe better if you're older

Free time- So what would you be doing if you weren't here right now?  Whatcha gonna do tomorrow?

And again, don't jump from their answer to telling them your answer.  Instead, explore their answer.  It's funny, but if you pretend to be interested in someone, then you often actually become interested in someone. </TEXT>

And on the opposing side, we have pandering over principle.

<TEXT> Well...that was a reasonably thorough dress down of them bogeymen, and it's not that I disagree, but there's a great deal the Dems can, should, and need to do on their own part to recalibrate what they represent.

Waving a finger at the other party while you pretend your own poo doesn't smell is not the way forward.  If you think "stumbling towards their next campaign contribution" is something unique to Republicans, you're ignoring what a corrupt mess Washington is.

We're not in campaign season or campaign mode right now, so writing this all off as purity tests and whataboutisms wrongly implies that now is not the time to discuss these problems.

There are reasons that Greens and independents refuse to vote for mainstream Democrats, and it looks a lot more Republican than you might think.  It goes something like "OK OK, let's do some voting for the people.  Yay, done?  OK, good, now let's get to work. Which of my donors benefits from this spending bill?  How does my SuperPac want me to vote on this other thing?"

Sanders is proof that a significant portion of the non-Republican voter pool cares about these things and does not feel compelled to simply vote Democrat because they're not Republicans.

You can carry on with your own "But but the GOP..." whataboutisms and imply that it's traitorous or naive to criticize the Dems at this point.  However, if the Dems are going to use this critical moment in history to exclusively talk down the GOP without adapting their own, they do so at their own peril.

I want them to have a policy and agenda that Greens, Independents, and Dems all think is in the interest of American citizens as a whole. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree in the sense of watching this for decades.

Bush and McCain arguing who the true conservative is.

But they weren't arguing who the true Republican was, were they?

Liberal is a word you avoided.  It needs to be OK to be a liberal the same way it's OK currently to be a conservative.

Conservatives (the Right) wants all of the things you mention.  The Tea Party (now aka the Freedom Caucus) is a bunch of conservatives.  Do not let them off the hook.

And Sanders (in the New York debate that should now be legendary) took apart mainstream Democrats for precisely what they are: a left-leaning party still beholden to banks and other corporate interests.

Disclaimer:  That doesn't mean I'm a Sanders supporter meddling.  I'm simply a liberal.

Should the Dems hold the GOP accountable?  Absolutely yes.

Are they?  In kind of a fuddily-duddily status quo kind of way.  Yay they filibustered Gorsuch.  Does that make them a principled outfit standing for what is right and just?

It's really kind of meh.

John McCain solo is outshouting them.  Lindsey Graham (god forbid) is gaining more coverage opposing Trump.

And the whole thing falls apart if they're still the other Goldman-Sachs party.

The most monumental change from the past year actually involves Trump.  Third party schmird party under this system.  On both sides, independents chose not to go the independent route.  On both sides, this disrupted the status quo.  If we're only allowed two parties (due to the electoral college and the apportionments act that keeps the house from growing), then both parties' umbrellas need to be larger.

Under our left umbrella, the backyard needs some serious scraping before we can legitimately stand for all we are supposed to, and that means people before business.

I disagree with a strategy to make the GOP bogeymen unless people can trust that we are not another flavor of bogeymen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like Bernie and appreciate how he isn't beholden to corporate interests and big banks.

However, this is massive overstep without a full-scale reconfiguring of the entire US education system, which is not going to happen.

a) European countries with free university are moving away and charging nominal tuition.  Not US-crazy tuition with crazy US student debt, but not free.

b) Any and all of these countries with free/almost free education track students from a very early age either toward or away from universities.  By middle school, you're either headed to uni or a vocational school.  By 16, you're in one or another, choosing a trade to apprentice in or studying advanced classes.

Then, you apply specifically for a major you intend to study and get accepted into that school or not.

This is a far more efficient system because a) you don't have a bunch of high schoolers studying for uni alongside a bunch of people who hate being there and b) you don't spend two years of uni drinking and thinking about what you might major in.

Making it free to just bobble about university is only going to increase the bobbling, and, if the UK can't afford free education anymore, how are we going to afford it?

Fer cripes sake, make it more affordable.  Cap tuition increases to cost-of-living increases.  Cap debt so that universities aren't so giddy to continuously sign up more people for crippling loans.

But but but.  What happened to killing campaign financing?

How about killing the reapportionment act to allow the house size to grow?

How about killing the electoral college?

I'm sorry, Bernie, but I find this irresponsible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand how you feel, but neither net privacy nor net neutrality have anything to do with government spying.

The government is free, within reason, to spy as they wish.  Neither of these give them greater or lesser freedom to do so.  This deregulation is corporate.

Technically, the government needs a warrant to spy on your internet activity.  Without a warrant, they're doing so illegally and the case would most likely be tossed out in court.  Will they go ahead and follow the rules?  I can't say for sure, but they will if they have a reason to bring a case against you.

As for propaganda and free speech, they've never attempted anything so extreme, and now I'm fairly confident it's too late.

A story from the early net (1992 or so)-  I was playing text games online and people would jump all over you if you used a swear word because they were very rightly concerned that the FCC would roll in and attempt to censor the net.  But that was 25 years ago and people freely use 'shit' and 'fuck' on Reddit and many more places with impunity.  At this point, the genie is far too far out of the bottle for them to even try that type of censorship.

In terms of turning the web into a propaganda piece, it's also far too late.  The media outlets will not be censored or turned to serve the government.  Businesses like Amazon will not be censored or turned to serve the government.  Free sites like wikipedia will not be censored or turned to serve the government.  It's worth noting the CIA tried to alter wikipedia's entry on them and they got caught out.

So, dude, no worries about these things you rightly fear.  It's not going to happen that way.

What you should be concerned about is "Hmm...wikipedia now takes ten minutes to load.  I'm on Comcast.  Is it because wikipedia says bad things about Comcast?"

You're worried about government propaganda.  Are you worried at all about corporate propaganda?

<TEXT> I will answer with a series of extinct questions:

Can I talk on the phone?

Call ____ in ______(anywhere more than 10 minutes away)?  Whose going to pay for that long-distance call?  Then, HOLY SHIT I got the phone bill.  It cost $75 to wish grandma a happy birthday.

What are we gonna watch tonight?

Who knows how to program the VCR?

Is that really true?  No, you're making it up.  No, seriously, my friend said so.  OK, let's look it up in either the dictionary, the encyclopedia, or the Guinness Book of World Records.  If it's not there, we'll probably end up bickering about it until there's a TV show 10 years later with the answer.

Is that a computer?  What can you do with it?  Answer: play games and print dot matrix banners with print shop.

OMG you have a beeper?

OMG you have a fax number?

Leaded or unleaded?

OMG, $15 to fill my tank?  WTF

How dare you say WTF? Mind your language.

Well, we're supposed to be driving to ____.  Where the hell are we?  Maybe we should ask that guy.  That guy: go down there until you see the big tree.  Turn left, then go straight to the chickens.  If you see the swimming hole, you've gone too far.

Where the hell is Barney?  We agreed to meet right here two days ago when we talked on the phone (which cost $15 in long-distance charges).  We're supposed to go watch ET and the movie starts in 7 minutes.

Can I write you a check?

OMG, where is my money?  If I lost it, I have to go home to get my bank book and then to the bank.  It's Friday night 8pm?  OK, I'll be going home.  See you Monday.  Can you give me a ride to work because I won't be able to go to the bank until lunch break?

Have you seen my car stereo?  It has a cassette player that will flip the tape back to the beginning so I can listen to Slippery When Wet again and again and again.  Start to finish, mofos.

Do you have a bomb?  Answer: Nope. Check-in agent: OK, here's your boarding pass.

Can you believe the in-flight movie is Ishtar?  I totally missed that at the theater, and now I get to watch it free!

How are my friends and family doing?  Are they OK?  I could call them, but that would cost $7500 in long-distance charges from Germany.  I guess we'll have to catch up in 6 months or a year when I get back?

Maybe I could write them a letter?  Hmm... That would cost me $5, or I could stay in this Amsterdam youth hostel one more night.  Yeah, 6 months isn't so long.

Where is the card catalog?

Will the library be able/willing to order this book?

Have you heard microwaves interfere with pacemakers?  Ima stay away from that shit.

Have you heard you can play frisbee with compact discs?  Then you just wipe 'em off and they're good to go.

Why do you keep lying about floppy disks?  They're the big floppy ones. 5 and a quarter.  A hard disk is that smaller blue plastic thing you put in advanced stuff like Macs.  What?  Hard drive shmard drive.  I just explained this to you.

Mini-discs?  Oh hell yeah.  MP3's?  Nope, sorry, don't get it.

Have you heard about the world wide web?  Go to the computer room and check it out.  It has a blowjob hall of fame.  (real tip from a friend).

World Wide Web?  No, I think you should use Lexus/Nexus.  Maybe Gopher.

Have you heard about MUDs?  It's like DnD but online.

Why can't I finish this PC game?  What do I have to do to not flee the final dungeon in terror?  I guess I'll never know, but maybe I'll play it again from the fucking beginning 3-5 more times just in case I missed something.  After 3-5 more tries:  I guess I'll never know.

Have you heard about the secret code that makes your Mortal Kombat character rip out the other guy's spleen?  You can get the codes for cheap if you pay $6 for a magazine with them.

How long do I have to wait in line to play NBA Jam?  My quarters can only wait so long.

How much does ____ cost?  I dunno, but maybe you could call Barney.  I think he paid for one of those 5 years ago, but I still haven't seen him since he ditched me before ET.  You can call him, but that would cost $15 dollars in long-distance charges.  Maybe you should just buy it.

You mean we're going to wait possibly until after the mid-term elections for Flynn, Sessions, Manafort (I'm not going to list the whole list) to be dealt with?

And the article highlights why it's not necessarily best to leave the FBI to its investigation.

<TEXT> Put simply, free market capitalists want zero regulation coming from Big Government.  However, didn't just wake up one day and say "You know what?  Let's regulate Big Business."  Rather, regulation is historically a response to businesses misbehaving, starting in modern times with T Roosevelt busting trusts and collusion.

Net privacy and net neutrality are two different things.  Losing net privacy means companies are free to track, snoop, and sell data.  Net neutrality means that you have equal connection speeds and pings to all sites.  Both regulations were put in place rightly so to protect consumers from predatory practices.  

Losing net privacy is not something we want but can be addressed by getting a vpn. Otherwise, as you mention, you will get targeted ads.  This is more nuisance than terribad, but it's not serving consumers in any way.

Net neutrality came as a result of Comcast choking speeds to sites they don't like.  When it's lost, for example, Comcast and Verizon are free to cut speeds on Netflix v Amazon Prime to push you where they want you to go, or force both Netflix and Amazon to buy them off to prevent this.  That's just square one, they'd also be free to choke speeds on games you play to encourage you to play ones of their choosing or offered by outfits again willing to buy them off so that we have full access speed.  I don't know that they'll do that, but the death of net neutrality means they can do it.  Is any of this in our interest?  Absolutely not.

And here's the sniff test:  We're part of the G20, the most prosperous countries in the world.  When the Republicans kill net neutrality, we're going to be the G20 country with the crappiest citizen internet rights.  Worse than Russia (permission to choke torrent sites).  Worse than Mexico (one of the strongest actually).

And this all because of vapid arguments about Big Government that abandon us to Big Business.

Final note: you mention Big Government regulating internet content.  Net privacy was a regulation protecting your data, not controlling content.  Net neutrality regulates the way infrastructure is used and also doesn't regulate content.

<TEXT> The government pricany protections that are getting flushed is a classic example of what BS "free market capitalism" is.

"Pure competition" is going to drive telecomms to use underhanded tactics to outdo one another and limit consumer freedom.

Supposedly, if free market pundits were correct, this freedom from Big Government would mean that these companies are going to provide us a better, greater, fairer internet than we would have with government regulation.  We won't.  Instead, Big Business will have free reign to herd us like cattle to sites and services of their choosing while they make more money selling browsing info and choke connections to sites that are not part of their conglomerate.

Don't just think of this in terms of the internet.  Continue to think about these implications whenever you hear people blowing hard about Big Government ruining the fun for Big Business. </TEXT>

"Bullshit" is stuff you don't like.  Doing the laundry and waking up on time are "bullshit".  Moreover, doing a job you don't like is "bullshit".  A lot of "adults" never escape "bullshitting" themselves.

Bullshit is when you don't tolerate things that are wrong.  Bullshit is when you don't tolerate "bullshit" when there's a serious job to be done.  Bullshit is when you take yourself seriously and can confidently call "bullshit" on "bullshit".

Most importantly, adults don't "bullshit" themselves.  That would be  bullshit. </TEXT>

YES!

This is what I've been waiting for.

First off, forget about the nicest thing. In 22 years of work, I've had 1.5 nice bosses.

a) I had one boss who did his job fairly.  He gets a .5

b)  The nicest boss understood something I was taught about in Boy Scouts as early as eleven, but I didn't see until I had a nice boss:

a) To lead is to serve-  You are not put above people to look down on them or think yourself the better.  You ARE your subordinates, and happy subordinates will do what you need them to do to the very end.

b) Generate consensus, and then make the hard decisions-  No one is ever going to 100% agree about what to do, but there is a critical difference between asking everyone for their ideas and then making a choice compared to not asking for ideas and making a choice.

c) Welcome feedback-  If you avoid feedback because you know it's going to be terribad, you are the problem.  If you think you are above the people who would be offering the feedback you avoid, you are almost certainly part of some Dickensian nightmare (please, sir, may I offer you feedback?) where you fancy yourself some sort up nobility overseeing a bunch of weaker plebes.  If that is how you view your subordinates, you will sow weakness and crap. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fair enough, but I also put numerous disclaimers in my posts about my attitude towards Mexico.

I harbor no bias against the people or the country.

I don't think anything I said was unfair or prejudiced against Mexico or Mexicans.

I've simply described two neighboring countries divided by wealth and opportunity.

a) I think it's a fair statement.

b) I think most Mexicans would agree.

I would expect to be drowned in downvotes if I said that Mexicans are a bunch of bad hombres who import rape and murder into the US.  

There's telling it like it is (which I think I did), and then there's "telling it like it is", which translates to "I'm going to say something wildly racist and insulting and parade it as the truth."

<TEXT> a)  I'll let you choose.  Imagining it now would be convenient.  Imagining it historically means that you had to make the ethically dubious decision to fight Mexico for BC and that Klondike gold in the name of manifest destiny.  Not gonna fight?  You have no Pacific coast territory.  You want from sea from shining sea?  You have to take it in an ugly bit that will be remembered.  To be nice, we won't say Toronto is an independent republic and you'll also have to grab that like the US did Texas.

b)  You're trumping your tough immigration policy where you have basically zero concerns about illegal Americans making their way into Canada.  Do you think the US has weak immigration policies?  Good god, you're validating Trump.  What you have is tough immigration policies combined with a border you don't have to worry about in terms of illegal immigration.

Let's pause for 5 minutes and imagine that the US was a country of 300 million people directly south of you who made 5 bucks a day on subsistence farming and the rich were a bunch of cartel-types whose profit was directly based on smuggling coke and heroin across your border. DISCLAIMER: Just an example, not saying this is the current state of Mexico, but similar.  Imagine if a majority of us Yanks tied their future economic prosperity and/or illegal trade to being able to cross the US-Canada border.

Policy shmolicy.  If you told me I had ten days to cross into Canada from the US without going through border checkpoints, I could do it so easily that I wouldn't need ten days if I was already up on the border.  The US-Canada border has the exact same problem that the US-Mexico border has:  it's vast and unpatrollable.  In fact, given that the great North Woods is far more hospitable than the desert areas between the US and Mexico, it would be easier to find some random bit of woodland to pass through where desert heat wasn't going to kill me if I didn't move rapidly.

Then, we can move on to the actual border checkpoints.  Does the RCMP need to check every pickup-truck to see if there are 5 Americans sealed in under the bed?

c)  Ima leave that alone. </TEXT>

Correction: I think my 22 million comes from how many Canadians live in proximity to the US border.  Kind of irrelevant.   My bad.

To preface, I'm going to tiptoe into this, and I definitely didn't make my post to incense Canadians.

So, first of all:  Whoosh!  The US has disappeared.  Not just the country, but the territory it occupies.

Vancouver is now immediately north of Tijuana, and Toronto is separated from Nogales and such by the Rio Grande.

a)  You've just lost a major, modern trading partner that fires your economy.

b) You have a (not to bag on Mexico) a struggling country whose citizens seek a better way of life by migrating into Canada, short-term for work and long-term to take advantage of its opportunities and prosperity.  These migrants who come in, legally or illegally, are not doctors and software engineers from other parts of the world.  They offer what they have: labor, mostly unskilled, on farms and in other menial work.

In this situation, what happens to wealth in/equality?

What about ethnic relations?  What do people already have to say about Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans in BC? 

You've asked me how it would be different.  I'd ask you if you really think nothing would change.
In the interest of fairness, perhaps Canadians would have a far better solution than the US currently does.  If so, I'd love to hear it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not to be a "shit disturber", but I'm an American who has worked twice in other parts of the world where my office had a Canadian majority presence.

The only Canadians that truly bothered me were full-on nationalists that hated the US and wanted to continually go off about things like Vietnam, various scandals, and anything about the US being crap.  To be fair, these same people were very vocal about the Quebecois and equally ready to take a dump on them:  "Let them go live with the Mohawks."

What I found less annoying but still annoying were Canadians assuming I knew nothing about Canada and how we in the US might learn by going up to visit.

"You should come up and see.  It's totally mellow."

The guy who said this didn't realize that I went to uni in Vermont and went up to Montreal regularly.

That said, I agree.  It IS totally mellow.

But what's missing here is the reason why.

Canada is a nation of 22 million people or so with significant ethnic minority populations in Toronto and Vancouver, where the minorities are not also impoverished economic minorities.

The US is a nation of 300 million people with profound wealth inequality that is not exclusively but commonly drawn along ethnic lines because of our history of slavery and our history, border, and discriminatory treatment of Mexicans and Mexico who now constitute very large segments of our population.

The easy-out logic for Canadians is "Yeah, well sucks to be you cuz we didn't do all of that bad stuff."

The reality is that Canada has a far simpler socio-geographic situation than the US, with a much smaller population of far fairer wealth equality that has a single border with a G20 country.

a) The roots of America's troubles are centuries old and no single American has control or ability to fix this far messier situation.  

b) If it were Mexico and not the US to the south of Canada, Canada would be a very different place.

This is why I'm not a US nationalist but I can't really accept nationalism coming from other countries.

I like Canada and would consider living there, but there are reasons things like rights come up in the US far more often.  It isn't simply because Canadians are mellow that rights do not feature as much, and the US can't simply fix itself by becoming more like Canada. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I'm talking about speech.  Go to r/atheism and have a look, or go to Youtube and search for "atheist pwns".

Let's say I'm a Jainist.  I believe all life is holy because God is the cosmos.  I try to escort mosqitoes out of my house and eat a strict vegan diet.  I am absolutely a believer and not an atheist.  I also abide in a policy of non-interference and believe in finding my own inner peace.

What use do I have for a bunch of atheists rolling in a-hootin and a-shoutin about the existence of God?

Why not just do what I, as an atheist, wanted all along?  Just fuck off and let me do my thing.

And, dammit, I'm not saying there's an equivalency.  There's simply what you do with yourself when you escape previous oppression.  Do you rise and value your newly found status, or do you slump back down into ugliness?

Secularism is on the rise.  Atheists are doing no one a favor by mistaking the rise of secularism for the rise of atheism.

Rather, a loud and obnoxious segment are going on the offensive.  I think they think they are helping with "the cause".  Atheists didn't advance secularism by getting in people's faces.  Secularism advanced without any atheists speaking out.  It did so quietly without affiliation, without identifying as anti-god.  If god doesn't exist, then it ends at non-existence, not going after those who believe to make them believe something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my wee town where I grew up, the clergy went after the first Pizza Hut for being open on Sunday.

The owner refused to bow down, and now pretty much everything is open on Sunday.  Why?  Mostly because a bunch of less pious pragmatic-minded people moved into the area.  Based on where I live (very very red), these outsiders weren't a bunch of atheists.  They were Christians who were more interested in shopping 7 days a week and didn't give two flops about some local religious crap about businesses being closed on Sundays.

This is what happened.  Now, let's propose that, instead, a bunch of card-carrying atheists convened on the area and demanded that Pizza Hut be open on Sunday because god doesn't exist.

My guess is that things would be much closer to what the old status quo was than the progress that occurred without such agitation.

Saying that much of US policy is influenced by religion is hard for me to agree or disagree with.  I see it from a 40-year perspective and can definitely say that it is less so than it used to be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, but human rights violations need not be supported by arguments that god does not exist.

Been to China? I lived there.  They're 90%+ atheist because the communists banned religion.  They're a very real illustration of how an "areligious" society doesn't behave any more ethically than ones with religion.

To say that obnoxious atheists are the equivalent of all misdeeds committed in the name of religion would be false equivalency.  

That's not what I'm trying to suggest.

If you look at the history of Christianity, it was very much in keeping with "The meek shall inherit the earth".  They were very thoroughly persecuted before they finally achieved primacy.  And after all that persecution?  The bullied became the bullies.  In a grand, multi-millennium fashion on a scale the world had never seen.

So, when atheism (really secularism more than atheism) gains traction, it disturbs me at a fundamental level when I see atheists take their newly-found stature on the offensive and start bullying the religious.  Neither Christianity nor Atheism bullied their way out of persecution.  Atheists attacking the religious is being vengeful.  Christians failed to resist this temptation, and I don't need religion to understand that vengefulness is wrong.  It goes right back to the human rights abuses you begin with.

So, no, atheists haven't done all of those bad things, but is bullying an indication of how atheism/secularism results in a better world?

<TEXT> I've lived in some very different parts of the world, so I take your point.

I'm largely speaking about the status of atheism in countries like the US and UK.

At the same time, rather than militant atheism, the shift in the countries I speak of is and has been based on separation of church and state.

Bangladesh comes to mind as a country where atheists have been killed for their beliefs.  I don't think anything I'm saying applies to a scenario like that, but I still believe that a country can't jump from theocracy to atheism.  If the US or the UK had attempted that, we'd still be at square one.  While I had no intention of writing about this in my first post, I'd actually say that this separation between religion and state needs to first occur to make further progress.  Freedom of religion paves the way to the legitimacy of secularism.

I grew up somewhere where I was told by my classmates that I was bad because I said I didn't go to church.  I was 8, but it still remains as a random conversation that became more important as I grew up.  I could try to ride back into my village and try to assail those who done me wrong, but the better solution was to just get out.

I hope that getting out is an option for you as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That might be true, but Dawkins is no teenager and his books sold like gangbusters.

And you can have a field day teeing off on people like the Kansas Board of Education and Kent Hovind.

But pushing only encourages a counter-push, and it's polarizing.

Secularism's achievements lie largely in passive resistance.

So yeah, being young lends itself to militancy, but mental age is another factor and I wouldn't be so harsh on a specific age set when people much older do not always gain the nuance one might expect from being older. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's interesting, but I don't hesitate to defend against aggressive religious types.

More importantly, a subreddit is still some kind of attempt to collectivize.

I grew up with my beliefs (or lack thereof) in a town of 3000 with 22 churches.  It was nice to talk to others with similar life views and was the target of believers, but I never needed and still do not need to be a part of a club.

It was nice to escape that little hamlet and even better to see the world become more secular, but the Dawkins-inspired rise of militant atheism was not something I anticipated or welcomed.

On the other hand, apatheism seems to be an inadvertent endorsement of labeling and "identitarianism".  There are centuries of thinkers and authors who were atheists without being apatheist.  It simply doesn't seem useful to me.

Disclaimer: I've learned about all of this in the past hour, so maybe I'll rethink it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, Mark Cuban,

1) Remember back during the campaign when candidate Trump was entitled to intelligence briefings but didn't want them?  That's kinda fishy.  Maybe guilty is a better word.

2)  Remember him winning and still not wanting anything to do with the intelligence briefings?  That's also kinda guilty.

3)  Then he got a standing ovation.  Then there was Flynn.  Then Sessions.  Then Manafort. Then Jared.  Then even Nunes has Russian links through a vineyard. As opposed to him not vetting, it looks almost like you had to have Russian links to be a part of his transition team

4)  I have no idea what brilliant conspiracy Cuban is referring to when he says Trump's too dim to have led it.

The brilliant conspiracy boils down to "Hey Russians, can y'all help us with this election?  You can?  OK, sweet!"

There is nothing brilliant at all about this hot mess.  It's more like you have to wonder what these turnips were thinking when they pulled all of this egregious shit and thought that it would never come to light.

5) Now Marky, if this is your idea of demonstrating your shrewd powers of analysis before you attempt a 2020 run, let's just say it isn't too brilliant on your part to guess at length and exonerate the president BEFORE the evidence from all the investigations is revealed.  It isn't a prudent move at this juncture, and the fact that you couldn't be bothered to write an article but instead, of all things, had to tweet your 12-part theory does not bode well for you, either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd like to think of it another way.

This country is no longer divided.  

There a lot of different views and agendas, but the vast majority are united against Trump.

I reject any and all suggestions that we are split down the middle.  We may have been at one point, and we may be again in the future.  

BUT this president does not represent the majority of American people, nor does he come close to representing half.  In fact, he stands for things that the majority of Americans oppose.  Even if he won the electoral college, he no longer has the support he did.

I'm not going to label those who still support this man deplorable, but I will call them what they are:  a minority.

This vocal minority may want what the president wants, but the vast majority does not.  

America is united against Trump.

Don't let him or his followers convince you otherwise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for specifics.

Tortoises v Solar station- I'd be inclined to hear what ecologists have to say.  Our country has a long history of screwing the environment for profit.  Granted I've heard of NIMBYs not wanting wind farms in places because they're an eyesore as opposed to killing birds, so yeah, there may be tweaking to be done here, but that shouldn't mean tossing the EPA.  Sniff Test:  What would other G20 countries do in this case?  I'd guess most would protect the tortoises.

ADA- Most of the ADA deals with commercial property/real estate.  It's about building facilities to a standard that makes them accessible.  A small business owner who can't afford to meet these standards needs to rent a facility if they can't afford to keep theirs up to code. AFAIK, you're talking about ramps and doors that let wheelchair-bound people negotiate a property.  If there are more excessive requirements, these might need to be rethought.  Sniff Test:  What would other G20 countries do?  My guess is that they have code up to US standards if not stricter.

Patents-  It's interesting because Mark Cuban says that patents are wreaking havoc on the software/app industry, with profiteers miring down new ideas by filing claims they know they don't truly have but are hoping to be bought out so that publishers can move forward.  It's also interesting that on Shark Tank, the first question sharks want an answer to is whether people have secured patent rights to their innovations because, otherwise, they have nothing and will be knocked off by competitors.  At the same time, I am aware of Disney trying to extend copyright from 70 years to however long they can get it extended.  Personally, I'm pretty sure all of the newcomers and small businesses want the protection that patent and copyright afford.  I could see how there might be rules set that are industry-specific, but patents serve a valuable purpose.  Sniff Test:  Any G20 countries that have or plan to ditch patent/copyright?  Not at all.  So, not here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NP.  Here's a bit more:

Moran also claims that on the evening prior to his death, Poe repeatedly called out the name of Reynolds. Substantial efforts have been made to identify who Reynolds may have been, with unimpressive results. At least one scholar felt that Poe may have instead been calling the name of Herring (Poes uncle was Henry Herring) (W. T. Bandy, Dr. Moran and the Poe-Reynolds Myth, Myths and Realities: The Mysterious Mr. Poe, Baltimore: E. A. Poe Society, 1987, pp. 26-36).

Poes clothing had been changed. In place of his own suit of black wool was one of cheap gabardine, with a palm leaf hat. Moran describes his clothing as a stained, faded, old bombazine coat, pantaloons of a similar character, a pair of worn-out shoes run down at the heels, and an old straw hat (Moran, Defense of Poe, p. 59.) J. E. Snodgrass offers a more detailed description: a rusty, almost brimless, tattered and ribbonless palmleaf hat. His clothing consisted of a sack-coat of thin and sleazy black alpaca, ripped more or less at several of its seams, and faded and soiled, and pants of a steel-mixed pattern of caseinate, half-worn and badly-fitting, if they could be said to fit at all. He wore neither vest nor neck-cloth, while the bosom of his shirt was both crumpled and badly soiled. On his feet were boots of coarse material, and giving no sign of having been blackened for a long time, if at all (Snodgrass, The Facts of Poes Death and Burial, p. 284). Moran also quotes Capt. George W. Rollins, supposedly the conductor of the train, as noting two men who appeared to be following Poe (Moran, Defense of Poe, pp. 60-61.)

That's like saying Robert Johnson, Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane are a bunch of amateurs compared to Skrillex.

I think artistically you are completely missing the whole concept of genre.  There's a reason you can't compare the Rolling Stones to Mozart.  I'm pretty sure there are simply a whole pile of genres you're unfamiliar with and, because you prefer whatever current genres you prefer (you make very little effort to support your side of this argument), yours are way better and more important simply because you like them. </TEXT>

I chose to do the same with "Steve".

Long story short, traveling with someone is second only to living with someone in terms of potential conflict and stress.

I hated it.  For Christmas break, I went out by myself and loved the experience.  I was so much more focused on taking it all in as opposed to inane yacking, and there was no stress at all about where we'd go, when, and how.

The only case where I travel with others is if we're going to go hang out on a beach or some such that doesn't actually involve a lot of real traveling.

If I'm hitting the road, I'm going it alone and very happy that I'm solo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seriously, communism has failed on a large scale due to corruption everywhere it's been attempted.  

Markets started out free until, inevitably, people try to cheat and abuse them.  The whole free market premise that "pure competition" will result in ethical business if we just remove all the rules is a horrible idea that will result in all new levels of cutthroat business and collusion than anything resembling a more ethical market.

I'll just add that, from a purely philosophical viewpoint, neither is truly a bad idea in its own right.  There's a spirit behind each that I can appreciate.  However, in practice, they are both highly problematic.  Note what both extremes have in common.  They are both tragically vulnerable to corruption.

Social democracy, which is what everyone from the USA to Sweden has, has proven the most successful and enduring.  Finding what is precisely the best "mixture" is an ongoing project, and there probably isn't one single best combination that would fit all countries and all situations.  And obviously, social democracy is not free itself from corruption.  On the other hand, it has proven to hold corruption in check far better than the other two extremes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2/3 of famous painters' work looks amateurish?  I have no idea what art you're looking at.

Music becoming overproduced is a cyclical event.  It last happened in the 80s.  After a while, there will be a new move back to raw.  See Nirvana.

In sports, the current players have the huge advantages of being able to learn from past players as well as new technology and materials.

Everything builds on everything.  So much is also derivative.  To prove your sports point, you'd have to get Wilt the Stilt, Jordan, Kareem, Kobe, LeBron, and Steph all playing each other at the height of their careers at the same time to establish who was truly the best.

If you're going to look at someone like Bolt, you're gonna have to resurrect the best sprinters of all time, give them the money to train full time, and give them all the bells and whistles that modern training offers from the lightest shoes possible to pulse monitors and dieticians.  Even then, Bolt and Phelps are both one-offs who will probably not be "demolished" by the next couple of generations of athletes.

And do keep that in mind.  You'll be OK twenty years from now when all of these current people are demolished and called amateurs by the next generation, right?  The babies being born right now are going to denounce all of that layered music and take buzzsaw guitar music to new heights.  I hope you're ready. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is slightly off-topic, but in the early days of the net there was this website with a list of pbem games.  I know TKO Boxing was on it, and I played a kind of fun space themed card game where every turn you could anonymously or publically bolster one opponent and screw another with asteroid collisions and whatnot.

Also on that list was a game I never tried but was said to be based on a rhetoric/oratory game from Ancient Greece.  It started with 15 players, and each round every player would submit their "oration", which could be about anything.  Then, after reading/hearing all of them, everybody voted one person out.  This continued until only one player was left.  I believe the name of the game was Plonk.

Anybody know what on earth I'm talking about? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmmm, so I'm not supposed to mention things made by inventors and scientists to compare with the internet, which was made by inventors and scientists?

OK, I'll have a go at it even though your argument is completely illogical.

You could simply say that internet, a technological innovation, is apples and oranges when trying to compare it to the founding of a state.

Then again, founding of states is historically a move that promotes stability when done right.  Without a stable state, innovations like the internet are far less likely to develop.  Perhaps the best example is when the collapse of the Roman Empire plunged western civilization into the Dark Ages, a thousand years of very little development where people just struggled to get by.  Things got a bit better in the Medieval era, but really took off with the development of the Italian city-states where the Renaissance took hold.  These states highly valued both scholarly endeavours and the arts, funding them in unprecedented fashion.

Whatever conditions may be afflicting America at the moment, the founding of the USA represented a new direction in pluralist governance that ended the age of monarchies.  And who funded the people who would create the internet? The US government birthed the ARPANET via a technical research program and the Department of Defense.

And, really, the internet is a one-off kind of invention that changes everything.  Your original claim is that people today are "consistently" doing better things than their predecessors.  I doubt they're doing much of anything that isn't highly derivative and extremely dependent upon those who came before us.

What we accomplish now, we only do so because we are standing on the shoulders of giants.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, and I think Flynn's motivations can be analyzed in a similar way.

Based on what we know right now, Flynn is almost certainly going to go to jail.

Either:

a) He's defecting and going to turn over everything on Trump and his administration.  He is at least historically a Democrat, so this is possible.

b) He's trying to help Trump and his administration by falling on his sword and using the immunity offer to see how much evidence there is against Trump and his cronies.  If they already have the goods, then there's no point in giving him immunity.  Also, if he gets jailed but Trump avoids prosecution, then he's gonna get pardoned down the road anyway.

c) He's desperate, knows he's going to jail, and is trying to get immunity out of self-interest simply because there's nothing else he can do.

I hope it's a), but I'm afraid that's too optimistic in this shitstorm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eh, it's funny you ask cuz I haven't lived there for 20 years. ^^

At the same time I know it's there via friends and that it's always been the better part of America over McDonald's and Hollywood.

But let me have a whack at it:  In Chicago, there's an ongoing production at a place above a funeral parlor called the Neo-Futurarium.  It's 30 plays performed in 60 minutes.  You get a menu of each skit name and then the audience screams out which one they want next.  You roll dice to see how much you pay to enter, and  if they sell out, they order out free pizza for the audience.  Every week they roll a die, and next week there will be that many new sketches in the production.

It's cool, fun and done by people who love what they're doing more so than becoming millionaires.  IOW by true Americans that the world seldom sees.

This may be less than street cred in Toronto, but I worked with the brother of the singer in Broken Social Scene. </TEXT>

The British are not so "keen" on being asked "how are you?" all the time.

They're more reserved, and you only ask that to your friends.

This is all good and clear that they want their space.

Then, you go out drinking with them for an evening, and the next day they're calling you "mate".

O.O

And I'm like, yeah, I might have blacked out at some point after 15 pints but I don't remember the part where we became "mates".

And then they're all like "Relax, I'm just taking the piss out of you."

And I'm like the fuck you are!  I'm not into water sports, so just stand the fuck over there.  What time is my flight? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it was a major mistake when the mandatory taping of everything said in the White House was ended.

It provided such a vivid and enriching window into history and truly put country before administration.

At much the same time, if we still had it, it would add a level of accountability that we lost when it ended.

Nixon was far more candid in the oval office than he was out in public, and the taping only made it harder for him to pull off his crimes.

And while I'm far from a fan, he was better than the current president on pretty much every level. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Money can buy you security.

If you're poor (or in debt), not being financially secure can be a source of immense stress.

Don't get me wrong.  Escaping poverty and debt is a great feeling, but there's a difference between feeling secure and feeling happy.

Once you're financially secure, money has far more possibilities, but there are few clear options in terms of what will buy you happiness.

People get lost in the labyrinth of consumerism buying stuff that they think will make them happy.  And consumerism is just the adult version of childhood Christmas.  Every year you get all of those new toys and you're buzzing with all the new things to play with.  Come March, the buzz is gone and you probably already want a bunch of new crap that has come out.  That money-oriented happiness is very fleeting.

Go camping

Go on a trip

Take up a new hobby

Explore a current hobby further

Learn something new

Learn a new skill

Help other people

Be kind to other people

Spend quality time with friends and family

These things cost very little, make you feel better about yourself, and generate something criminally underrated: fond memories.  Of all the toys you got for Christmas, how many of them resulted in a fond memory beyond opening up the present?  Maybe a few, but most probably not.

So again, money is very important if you don't have enough.  Our culture seduces people into thinking that we never have enough and always need more.  But more seldom buys happiness so much as it breeds a desire for more.

And then let us return to the original statement about poor kids.  FFS let their families have health care and stop letting those who are beyond financially secure yap on about how we can't afford to do so.  We're not giving those kids money to spend on whatever, we're helping them achieve security, and those who are not poor or in debt can still get a sense of satisfaction that this government spending may not be buying happiness, but it's buying the second best thing: relief.

I've been poor and in debt.  I'm not now, but money has always been more about security than me being happy. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Crispbread inspiration? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-30 15:42:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've gotten into eating a slow carb diet (as opposed to low carb, only eat wholegrains).  With fluffy loaves of white bread now a thing of the past, I have to say I really enjoy eating crispbread, and wanted to ask for new ideas about how people use it.

My obvious mainstay is simply as a cracker substitute.  I dip and scoop into soups and stews.

My innovation is inside out sandwiches.  Because crispbread is so crumbly, it doesn't work well in the position traditional bread does, so I apply/wrap my sandwich ingredients around the crispbread, which is now in the middle.

I'd love to eat more of it, and hope y'all have other ideas about how to incorporate it into cooking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not that I don't want them, but I also don't consider it mandatory to have them.

Put another way, I respect the premise of having kids too much to just "go for it".

-haven't met the right person

-enjoy my life as it is

-grew up surrounded by divorce in both my and my friends families

-I require myself to settle down into one place and successfully nurture a pet before trying to raise another human being

-can always adopt; there are more kids than families to raise them properly

But bottom line: If someone doesn't have kids and doesn't want to, leave them alone and do not harangue them to have kids.

It's their business, not yours.

I don't care if you're a mom, a dad, a sister, an uncle, or some government official.  You are not entitled to pressure people to have kids.

Just in case anyone missed the key point:

Anyone having kids is the business of those who choose or choose not to.

If you're unhappy about someone else's choice, go adopt another kid for yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ahh the 80s...They look so cartoonish now, but yet it was all so serious then.

Politics:  People were in the bliss about Ronnie while he shot us into the deficit stratosphere.  There was this continuous imminent sense that WW3 would break out and result in total nuclear war.  Three very different movies cover this very well:  The Day After, Threads, and Testament.  Threads wins.

Music:  New Wave in the early 80s and hair bands in the late 80s.  The summer of '83 was a great summer for music, and I spent nearly every day at the local pool swimming and listening.  Duran Duran, Safety Dance, Electric Avenue, Every Breath You Take.  Half of the 80s classics came from that summer.  The fall would give way to Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Prince on the rise.  At the other end of the spectrum, Def Leppard would kick things off, then Van Halen, Motley Crue, ACDC and Aerosmith would make a resurgence only to be topped by Poison, Bon Jovi, and Guns N Roses.

A focus on outlandish production led many 70s class acts astray into far cheesier territory.  Clapton and Genesis come to mind first, but there are many more.  I love the Ramones, and I love the anti-Reagan sentiment of Bonzo Goes to Bitburg, but I hate that the lead-in features hand bells...

That all said, I would only come into contact with my favorite music from the 80s in the 90s:  My Bloody Valentine, The Pixies, The Cure, and the golden age of hip hop.

Movies:  Blockbusters came of age, as did sequels.  This amazing thing called a VCR meant you could watch all of this at home, and there would be lines at the local video rental shop every holiday weekend.  You definitely were meant to rent.  The first time after we bought a VCR, I recall going to the video shop and seeing Raiders of the Lost Ark on sale for $85.

In terms of actual movies, Lucas and Spielberg dominated in a time before more critical lenses got focused on both of them.  David Lynch was the indie darling who made edgier things like Blue Velvet and Wild at heart.

TV: The earliest 80s stuff truly embraced some serious redneck culture.  Believe it or not, BJ and the Bear was a TV show, not some kind of homoerotic porn.  Truckers!  Smokey and the Bandit was about driving a truck full of beer across the country while being chased by the cops.  People loved it.  The Dukes of Hazzard!  About "good ol' boys" driving a car around and messing with the stupid, corrupt police.  This all gave way to the A-Team, the Fall Guy, Knight Rider, Magnum PI and MacGuyver, shows that were all in one way or another based on Popeye, where the good guys beat up the bad guys.  More serious issues, like how the cocaine trade was a serious problem, got fashionably if not flippantly covered by Miami Vice, the king of mid to late 80s TV.  At much the same time, we were thoroughly entertained by the Cosby Show.  Seems a bit more sinister now and totally unfair that Lisa Bonet got kicked for making Angel Heart, a truly great 80s indie movie.

I won't touch day or evening soap operas, but they were there.

On Wheel of Fortune, you had to go shopping and spend your earnings after every round.  If you $80 left, you had to buy a dog statue or something else you really didn't want.  Some stay-at-home dad learned how to game Press Your Luck and eventually just stopped playing because he'd won enough.  One of the best resurgences of the 80s was Jeopardy!, which is still going strong and one of the most intelligent things you'll ever see on American TV.

Fashion:  In high school, my morning ritual included rolling my pants into a cuff and doing up my hair with mousse on the sides and hairspray up top.  I spent more time in the 80s primping than probably the rest of the decades that follow combined.  Girls permed their hair so that it stuck straight up at ridiculous lengths.  One girl in my high school earned the nickname "Dynamite" because it looked like a stick had just exploded in her face.  Did that deter her from daily having 18-inch bangs and side hair radiating out from her face?  Not at all.  She thought it was cool.

Consumerism: Along with the VCR, it was cool to have a walkman.  All music was on cassette.  Atari 2600 gave way to Commodore 64, which gave away to the NES.  Floppy disks were actually floppy, and you went to arcades to play super-advanced games for a quarter a pop.

Fun fact: the 80s hated the 70s.  So much hatred for bell bottoms and halter tops, and just this sense that it was better to be in the 80s than the 70s.  The 90s kind of disagreed with the 80s hate and embraced the 70s.

He left infrastructure out of the budget specifically for this reason.

My guess is that he's going to attempt to privatize the entire interstate highway and rail system (possibly even air), and then the corporations that get to charge tolls on all of it get insane tax cuts in return for upkeep.

The Freedom Caucus will not oppose this, and the entire thing will reap unheard of riches for the rich.  The entire GOP will back it, and that will be that.

<TEXT> Camping at a scout reservation, my friend and I decided to set up off by ourselves where no one else was camping.

It's very hard to describe, but coming from a distance through impenetrably thick brush, there was a blood-curdling scream.

It sounded like a woman screaming at the top of her lungs, but it went on for a good ten minutes continuously.  As in, if that were a woman screaming, she'd at least have to stop for a breath.

We fucked off right out of there and camped somewhere else.

Later that summer, a family of bobcats was found to be living there.

I, to this day, do not think we were in imminent danger of being attacked or some such, but you had to be there to hear the sound.

It was unlike anything you ever see on a nature show, and something I'd have attributed to the supernatural if we hadn't found out the cause. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm highly sensitized to "echo chamber" situations.

I try to find holes in what I understand and believe and welcome intelligent opposing commentary.

I'm a liberal.  A fairly strong one at that, but I don't really enjoy sitting in a circle and nodding about whatever.  And sadly, when I hear people go overboard, I get treated like a traitor at times if I call out inaccuracies and hyperbole.

A good friend of mine showed me a documentary about the anti-NATO protests in Chicago (2012?).  It started with "NATO is a machine for war and the US should leave it."

After watching, I said I disagreed with that characterization of NATO as a war machine.  NATO was treaty-bound by Bush to go into Afghanistan.  My understanding of the Balkans intervention of the 90s is that the majority of people there supported it.  And, throughout the Cold War, it was a stabilizing factor that kept the peace.

The response I got was "but war is wrong".  Well, I consider myself anti-war, but there are defensive and offensive aspects of it that make militaries and military alliances a necessary thing.  That doesn't mean all wars are justified, but I see the point of the US being a part of NATO.

"But war is wrong".

I didn't say it, but that's overly simplistic and ignores a deeper understanding of the world.

I didn't see my friend for a year.  The next time I did, he asked "Have I shown you the anti-NATO protest documentary?".

...

He hangs out with people who think exactly the same way.

I'm aware of how I don't want to be impressionable in such a fashion.

"There is nothing in the world weaker than a virtue untested by fire."

<TEXT> Not hopeless, but very difficult to do deliberately.

The status quo is fickle and changes when it's ready.  If you try to push an issue, the status quo will resist, all the while some other aspect of the status quo will change seemingly effortlessly.

Fashion is a lite example.  You can't go out one day and try to force a new style upon people.  It won't work.  But if you adopt a new fashion, there's always the chance that others will adopt it as well.  When enough people do, boom, there goes the status quo in a new direction.

On a more important note, this is why you may not want to grab a torch and pitchfork to try and assert your political views.  It may simply be better to speak out when you can, but with a calm voice and a clear message. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump does not "sign approval" of an independent counsel.

Calls for a special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 US election[edit]

On December 21, 2016, Democratic Congresswoman Nydia Valzquez wrote a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking Lynch to appoint a special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 United States election. Such an appointment would have been unusual in that the conflict of interest to be addressed was anticipated, following the inauguration of Donald Trump as president, rather than immediate.[19]
On February 24, 2017, Republican Congressman Darrell Issa called for the appointment of a special counsel on the Real Time with Bill Maher show.

On March 2, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election following revelations that he had had meetings with the Russian ambassador while a Trump campaign surrogate, and had falsely testified otherwise in his senate confirmation hearing. The decision over whether to appoint a special counsel thus devolved to his deputy, currently Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente. In senate confirmation hearings for Rod Rosenstein to replace Boente as Deputy Attorney General, ongoing in March 2017, several democratic senators have sought to make the confirmation conditional on Rosensteins agreement to appoint a special counsel. Rosenstein has declined to make such a commitment, and because democrats are in the minority, this is unlikely to prevent his confirmation.[20]

Pop, dance, and electronica all birth subgenres like baby kittens, and I can't like them all.  But there's definitely good pop, dance, and electronica.

<TEXT> After watching the contortions of my face as I tried to figure out what to say next, he humbly explained that he had never met the president before the election. As president-elect, Trump wanted to have a conversation with Tillerson about the world given what he gleaned from the complex global issues he dealt with as CEO of Exxon Mobil.

When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, I was stunned.

When Tillerson got home and told his wife, Renda St. Clair, she shook her finger in his face and said, I told you Gods not through with you.

With a half-worn smile, he said, I was supposed to retire in March, this month. I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids.

That's an awesome way to pick sec of state.

While I don't know the etymology of that, I can tell you that one good reason to call pot weed is that it's incredibly easy to grow.  Incredibly easy.  Imagine of you could plant some beer seeds and then come get your beer 3 months later.  It's really that easy.

<TEXT> You can cook marijuana.  Make a cake, cinnamon toast, etc...  Brownies are perhaps the most famous.  No bad smell and no respiratory ill effects.  Moreover, I'd say alcohol is more addictive.

I'd go a step further and say our society would be a better place if people went to a "bar" on weekends and ate some brownies than, as they do, going to bars and consuming alcohol.  There's be a lot less violence and a lot less vehicle fatalities.

The only way I think I could persuade you of this is if you tried marijuana once.

I was a child of the Reagan era and for a very long time eschewed marijuana because I thought it was some combination of more addictive and more powerful than alcohol.  After trying, it became obvious to me that I had been misinformed and led to believe things that weren't based in fact.

I'm older now and neither alcohol nor pot feature significantly in my life, but I hate that one is demonized while the other is more demonic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All due respect, but I don't find that a satisfactory explanation of what the Dems are doing right now.

I don't want to use "breathing fire" because I think the GOP is good at what that conjures in my mind.  I'd prefer the term "taking to task".

Who is taking Trump and the Republicans to task?  Two Dems come to mind: Franken and Warren.  Booker a bit, and Pelosi when she's not defending herself.  There are a handful more who I can't remember because they didn't really push enough for me to recall them.

There are hundreds of other Dems who have pretty much gathered their popcorn pails and sit watching this all unfold.

Their involvement amounts to "Meow".

The key difference here is that the GOP mercilessly attacked Obama for things very much based on opinions about how to best run the country.  They did so for years.

This is not a debate about how best to run the country.  The issue I'm speaking to here is about the president using his office for his own profit and very openly engaging in activities that could be construed as bribery by foreign nations.  Namely China.  I'm leaving the whole Russian thing out of this.

I don't buy that it's about the media not covering their opposition.  It's about their opposition being luke-warm and virtually non-existent.

And this is not a new thing.  The Dems defeat themselves if they don't speak out because they don't want to upset moderates, or think it's futile because they will be voted down.  The Dems are timid, and the fire comes from the right...or from a boutique in San Francisco...or Sanders.

Status quo died in November.  There's a very serious fight afoot about what can and cannot be accepted from a president and his administration.

McCain is agitating more than the Democrats.

The heart of this is that Democrats count on their base and play to the other side.  That's the status quo, and I'm done being a base they can count on if boutiques and people at town halls are the actual ones fighting the fight while they watch.

They have no excuse for their tepid reaction.  There's a fire lit under Trump and his cronies.  As such, they feel no heat themselves to do more than shake their heads.

Not good enough.  The Dems have a very significant chance to define themselves as the party of right against a party of wrong.

Lindsey Graham, of all people, is breaking with his own party to speak up in opposition.  Why should other GOP rank and file do so if the actual opposition party doesn't have enough guts to aggressively attempt to end the president's profiteering?

NYPD is now speaking up.  They managed to get press coverage.  Are you really suggesting that the media is ignoring congressional opposition to Trump's misconduct?  

Or are the vast majority not really saying much? </TEXT>

I expect my reps to object to the president charging the US government to use his own properties, which he is not divested from.  I also expect them to object to countries like China issuing trademarks on behalf of these same businesses.

At the very bare minimum, I expect to hear loud objections that force those who don't object to appear to be offering their approval of this unacceptable state of affairs.  With the right amount of opposition, I'd expect them to "do something".  They can legislate against this behavior right now.

What really disappoints me is when there is no meaningful opposition to conflict of interest in congress, but a private business has to be the one to take the administration to task. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gettysburg was a battle on a massive scale, with skirmish lines that went on for miles.  It was very bitterly contested with very good generals on both sides fighting very strategically.

Things were not progressing, but the confederate generals identified a point that, if they managed to overrun, they could get behind and open up the whole series of union lines.  This was Cemetery Ridge.  The problem was that a line of cannons were positioned at the top of Cemetery Ridge.

Under General Pickett and a couple other generals, 10,000+ men rushed this position over a good half mile or so of open ground (actually I'm pretty sure part of it was corn field), being fired upon by the cannons the entire time.

They pulled it off, but lost half their forces in doing so and were quickly beaten back.

These were enough losses to end the Battle of Gettysburg.  And, Pickett's charge would ultimately be the last time the South went on the attack in Northern territory.

I love nature and all, but I really enjoyed visiting Gettysburg more than all the beautiful national parks I've been to.  Totally worth it for  a person with interests in American/military history.

Now, I want to go see Waterloo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not planning to hang around for a lengthy back-and-forth about all of this, but I will have a shot at explaining what I mean and where I'm coming from.

1. Theory

In a nutshell, the claim goes that government regulation is bad because it interferes with the "pure competition" of a "truly free market".  There is a strong emphasis that this "pure competition" would result in businesses regulating themselves to satisfy and win over consumers from their competition.

The truth, as history demonstrates over and over, is that pure competition results in either a) ruthless competition where companies will do anything and everything to destroy their competition and lie, cheat, and steal in order to sell their products or b) collusion where businesses stop competing and conspire with one another to fix prices and share profits at the expense of consumers.

In a nutshell, ethics are one of the first things cast aside in "pure competition" scenarios.

The above will be revisited in numerous later points.

2. History 

Smith did not actually recommend governments stay out of business completely.  Rather, he wanted business to go on with as little restriction as possible.  Later in life, Smith also became increasingly uneasy as the rich became less interested in ethics.  More specifically, he saw the rich becoming more interested in themselves than they were in driving economic forces for the overall benefit of their countries. 

3. Big government

Did government just wake up one day and say "You know what? I think we should go interfere with business and trade.  Let's regulate it."

No.  Businesses in so many areas had relatively free markets until widespread abuse and corruption forced government to act (evidence again that "pure competition" doesn't result in businesses self-regulating).  A major example of this is the robber barons and one could argue that modern regulation began with T Roosevelt's trust-busting efforts.  That said, the late 1800s are chock full of unfettered business behaving in all matter of vile ways.

So, who created "big government"?  The businessmen themselves did.

There's a strong parallel between regulations and laws.  They don't just happen.  They arise out of need.

Businesses saying they need to get rid of regulation so they can behave better on their own is like the mafia saying we need to get rid of police so that they don't have that hassle.

The free market argument goes that business ends up having to buy influence in government to avoid/control regulation, but government is the only check that average citizens have against multi-million/billion business/corporate entities.

And how about this:  if Big Business really doesn't want Big Government, they could turn their campaign donations toward creating Small Government by getting money out of politics.  I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for that to happen.

Best of all, we just got front-row seats to watch what happens when government gets deregulated.  So far, climate Science is going to get swept under a rug and coal companies get to dump waste in rivers.  Just wait and see what's up ahead.

4. Big Business

Looking back at history, what kind of business resulted in regulation because it misbehaved?  It wasn't small business owners (not that they're angels).  As business gets bigger, ethics become more of a problem.  Corporations are a convenient way for no one person to be responsible for the ethical lapses of these economic juggernauts.

We live in an era of 900-lb gorillas.  They cry about regulation but already have preposterous amounts of power nationally and internationally.

The whole free market argument is to unchain the gorillas that are already barely chained.  Why?  Because they're going to behave themselves without government interference.  Pure competition is going to mean that they have to behave ethically to win over consumers.  That's not even an argument.  That's insanity.

5.  Deregulation by sector

To make a list of common categories of regulation, three important ones are:

a) Consumer protection-limiting the ways business might lie to you or collude

b) Citizen protection- you may not even be their customer, but they may be polluting your community or something similar

c) Fair competition- large companies may try to smash small companies to eliminate competition

How might deregulation affect the following? 

i) healthcare- human health should not be a for-profit business.  In the case of "pure competition", insurance companies will do like what they've already done:  cast out the non-profitable customers via 'pre-existing condition clauses' and high premiums.  We're fighting a healthcare bill right now that reduces regulation in this area.

ii) software- Remember Netscape Navigator?  Remember Bill Gates' email about smashing the bug?

iii) construction- building things to code?  The Trump administration is in the process of getting rid of those pesky codes.  Who's going to benefit?  Will we have better buildings as "pure competition" drives these builders to regulate themselves?

iv) education- for-profit universities have generated an amazing track record in a realtively short amount of time working outside of traditional accreditation systems.  But accreditation is regulation, right?  Are they improving university ethics or destroying them?

6. tort law v tort lawyers

The response to most of 5 above is "But you're giving all of these examples of bad business occurring under government regulation."  And my response is, "So your solution to all of those problems is to get rid of regulations?"

And the answer to that comes with the next free market premise:  that instead of regulations, we will shift everything to "tort law",  meaning all of the liability and culpability gets addressed by suing one another directly for damages.

My response in a nutshell: shifting all of the executive and legislative regulation so that the judiciary exclusively deals with it through tort law will only make the problem worse.

The game changes but it doesn't go away.  The judiciary is already involved in business litigation, and how great does that work?  It's a game of who has the best lawyers and legal teams, and it's still heavily weighted in favor of those with the money to buy an advantage in the system.  All tort law all the time will just make this even more so.

7.  Conclusion and disclaimers

In saying all the above, I do not mean to say our current regulations are all good or that there are no problems.  The problem I do see is free market proponents lingering in vague generalities about Big Government and too much regulation.  The solution to over-regulation is to streamline and eliminate what may be over-regulated in the system as is, not to just dump it all and trust this notion of "pure competition" to sort it out instead. 

And I like the spirit behind free market arguments in that people are trying to think of better ways to run things.  I'm just not anywhere remotely close to subscribing, and a lot of what I see seems naive.

Anarchy and communism are also interesting ideas.  They have both been show to work on small scales, basically in groups/communities where everyone agrees not to be exploitative and truly works to make the system work.  On a large scale, they fail miserably due to corruption.  I'd put free markets in the same category.  There are cases in history where they have worked, but arguing that we should take a United States populated by mega-corporations and give them a chance to just do the right thing absent of regulation is a bad idea.  A very very bad idea.

Free market propaganda, on the other hand, is so wrong (both ethically and in terms of correctness) on so many levels that you must support it with religious levels of fervor to actually believe it will work.

Going back to a gold standard is another fairytale impossibility.

Mostly mostly, though, their positions seem very reactionary and few of them seem to be able to argue their position beyond sweeping proclamations about what generally sound like magic bullet solutions.

And I don't hate them.  I'm just very underwhelmed.  For the new party to be as underwhelming as the two big parties?  No thanks.  I'll keep looking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Governments and peoples are two completely different things.

Russians are as responsible for their leadership as I am for Trump, perhaps even less so.  Which means you have little to no say in a system that is corrupt and rigged in favor of those who can pay for representation.

Russian people, their culture, and their history are all an amazing episode in the story of humanity.  Their contributions to the arts, especially literature, cannot be downplayed.  

That's not to say it's all a happy or just story, but no story is all good or all bad.

It's unfortunate but very real that the US and Russia have had and continue to have an adversarial relationship in global politics.

Messing with our election is a very serious thing and not really something any American can accept.  But then again, it wasn't *your* idea, right?

It was your leader's choice to do so.  He's not helping with the situation at all.

But I don't hate you.  I went to Russia and found it all very interesting and memorable.  The people were nice and friendly towards me as their guest.

<TEXT> That's interesting, because I believe we group people by color to demonstrate that racist acts are being committed against them.  We also use them to show evidence of systemic racism when, for example, these groups are paid less than their non-minority counterparts.

Yes, I am talking specifically about the US.  It seems that this term evolved in Europe to have derogatory connotations.  Sometimes words diverge geographically over time.  

In England, the words 'blasted' and 'bloody' count as swear words.  They don't in the states.  'Fanny' is a polite word for 'butt' where I grew up.  It's something far more offensive that you don't want to be saying in London.   Who's right?  No one.  It just helps to be sensitive when you're talking to others who might misconstrue what you're trying to say.

In the states, the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) is one of the most prominent voices fighting against racism and inequality.

Are they racist for grouping themselves by color?

<TEXT> When we talk about minorities, technically we are grouping people by the color of their skin.  Is talking about minorities racist?

Again, usage and social connotation are what determines whether a word is offensive or not.

As far as I know, those who we refer to as people of color embrace the term and do not find it offensive.  In fact, the terms seems to have evolved as an umbrella term embraced by a number of various minorities.

If those that it refers to decide that they find it offensive, then it may further evolve to be unacceptable.  That change would happen through a social movement.  It doesn't happen by looking in a science book and decreeing a new linguistic rule. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, because usage defines what words mean.

You know why we call tanks tanks?  Because, when they were in development during WWI, their true use was top secret.  The program was disguised as a plan to develop rolling water supplies.  Water "tanks".  Get it?  So, now that we know that tanks are not for transporting water, do we have to rename them?

We carry on without getting pedantic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup, investing in social programs saves money in the long run by creating more productive members of society.  Those left to stagnate have a far higher chance of being a greater financial burden for everyone.

Just one example: Look at how many people are in prison and how much we have to pay to care for them.  Granted, some in prison are simply incorrigible.  However, many turn to a life of crime when they  lack the skills, opportunities, and money to live their lives as productive citizens.

Note well how the US has a far bigger problem with crime and incarceration compared to other countries with similar development levels who, pretty much across the board, have more functional social democratic systems.

The American fiscal conservative is far more extreme than a British Tory, as just one example. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some of the most useful things I've learned about in my life are cognitive dissonance, group think, and logical fallacies.

You want to be able to police your own thinking before you move on to judging or debating the ideas of others.

Instead of surrendering to this whole post-truth 'people must be entertained to be persuaded' acceptance, critical thinking needs to feature earlier and more often in our education system.  I can assure that it does in the better private schools.

Getting it into the broader context of public schools is the challenge, but it is far better to address this challenge than just accept that everything has to be fun for the public to embrace it.

And, even if we are moving into "a post-truth era", it ought to be noted that we've been through numerous post-truth eras throughout history.  The dismissal of the educated by the ignorant represents more of human history than vice versa.

The reality?  We'll probably have to go ahead and do another tour of post-truth until people want truth more than titillation.  Fair enough.  The result is just that we collectively get to be remembered as one of those dark ages periods where things went to crap until we collectively decided that we didn't want to be this way.

If I'm to accept the author's proposition, then I say let's get it on.  Bring on the stupidity so that the stupidity can end sooner rather than later.  

It might just be that this is what's happening.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-02-22 03:48:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Reporting that Trump is lying hasn't deterred him, nor did it keep him from winning the election.  I would, in fact argue, that the media reporting his lies served to amplify them.  At much the same time, I do not feel that the media aggressively confronted him about the lies during the election, and now it's even harder to do so.

My proposal would be to avoid carrying the content of the lies as headlines:  Trump claims largest electoral victory in history v Trump lies about his election performance again.   Do you see what I mean?  In the former, what he wants to say gets disseminated, whether the report is for or against that information.  In the latter, his lying gets disseminated, and you actually have to read to find out what his claim was.  Sadly, in this day and age, actually having to read is a step too far for many.  Those most susceptible to gaslighting, I would guess, tend to be those who don't actually want to read.  So my idea is to bury the lies in text instead of carrying them in tweet-length headlines.

Maybe that's just not the right way to go about it.  If so, I'd like to hear why.  Or, I'd like to hear other approaches other than simply acquiescing and suggesting we're headed into the "post truth era".  This smacks of capitulation. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Using birds for scale? A request. A query. A challenge. A mission! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-18 09:20:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello,

After my recent discovery of r/birdsforscale, I come to you in a search for answers.  Difficult answers to difficult questions.

I'll preface by saying birds have made a truly noble contribution to visual arts by serving as a beautiful and subtle device for showing the scale of things painted, drawn, and otherwise visually rendered.  Without birds to show scale, I would not be here speaking to you.

So the burning questions I have are about the origins and classic uses of birds used in art to articulate the immensity and/or to indicate the diminutive size of subjects, objects, people, and possibly even other birds in the history of art.

My questions are:

1) What is the earliest known case of a bird being used in a painting or drawing to show scale?

Was it a the Chinese? The Greeks? The Dutch Masters?

Who did it first occur to that one of our feathered friends was just the size to contrast size with?

2) What is the most classic painting that uses birds to show scale?

  Here I hope to find a painting by one of the all-time greats featuring at least one bird, if not a whole flock of them, for scale.  Alternatively, it doesn't have to be by a famous artist, but maybe it's simply a painting or drawing that we're all familiar with.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your responses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello birds for scalers,

I have to admit I was somewhat skeptical when I saw the title of this subreddit, but by jove these birds are totally revealing the scale of all kinds of stuff.

My question/request may have been covered at the inception of this subreddit and I missed it, but what I'm wondering is when the first birds were added to artistic works to show the scale of things?

Did the Greeks have birds for scale?  The Dutch Masters?

The Mona Lisa was cool and all, but Da Vinci missed out by not having a sparrow flying off into the background or a parrot on her shoulder.

So, please help me out here.  Is there bird scale historian that has traced this noble lineage?  Similarly, what would y'all say is the quintessential piece that includes a bird for scale? </TEXT>

<TITLE> A modest proposal re: server down times at prime times </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-05 00:19:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is now a weekly problem that is bad for both devs and players.

I propose:

Set one off-night for server server stress tests.  Say Tuesday or Wednesday prime times, and offer double xp to all players for four hours at those times.

This will make up for player lost time during weekends, allow the devs to sort the problem at a time other than the weekend, and provide an impetus for this to truly get fixed.

I'm writing this as I'm once again blocked from logging on after it took 2 hours to initially log on.

And I know that I'm not the only one. </TEXT>
