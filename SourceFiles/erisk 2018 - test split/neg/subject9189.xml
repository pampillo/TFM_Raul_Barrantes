<TEXT> It amazes me that after being insulted by Trump, beaten by Trump in the primaries, and having his wife's face insulted by Trump, that he would still go on to fight Trump's battles.

Let's not focus on Russia's interference and Trump's team's collusion. Nope. Let's instead focus on grilling Yates for upholding the values of this country. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah this was a pretty damning testimony. Basically 100% Flynn was in league with the Russians and Trump and his team were warned multiple times of this fact but went ahead anyways and only fired Flynn when that info got leaked.

This was essentially a hearing promoting the reason for a special investigation and special prosecutor. Basically Congress was all in agreement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> here are a few signs the guy likes you but is just too scared to tell you:

1. He seems to be around a lot.

Maybe he goes to your coffee place just about every day. If you work together, he might find himself near your desk or sitting near you at lunch. Maybe you see him at the water cooler more than anyone else.

A good sign that he likes you  but is too shy to tell you  is if he tries to be around you all the time and doesnt steal the spotlight. Hes trying to figure out how to make his move.

2. He goes out of his way to be nice to you.

He doesnt necessarily go over the top, but he does things a good friend would do, even though you don't consider each other good friends.

He'll save you a seat. He'll grab you a coffee or a donut. He'll share his snacks or his lunch  anything he happens to be munching on (I know this sounds silly, but when guys share their food, it means something).

He is always polite and respectful to you. And, most importantly, this feeling of warmth resonates from his body.

3. He always smiles at you and breaks eye contact.

The truth is he cant help smiling at you, but he does his best not to show it. He desperately wants to stare deep into your eyes, but he's afraid you wont want to do the same.

4. He always gives you his undivided attention.

When you two are chatting, his focus is entirely on you. This happens even when youre in a group. Id bet hes looking at you even when youre not saying anything, but he probably tries to hide this.

5. He compliments small changes to your appearance.

That new haircut. That new dress. Those new shoes. That new bag. That new shade of lipstick. Whatever it is you've discarded or added, he's likely to make a comment on it. It's his way of showing you he notices you.

Of course, he may not compliment you as often as he'd like. But he definitely will give you a sincere compliment on occasion. Which  let's be honest  is better than most guys.

6. He doesnt ask you out  even though you suspect he likes you.

Sometimes, the nicest guys are the shyest. They don't see themselves as being the aggressive type, so they have a difficult time doing things outside their comfort zones.

It's a shame, really, because a little bit more confidence would make their lives so much better (and theyd probably get more dates).

Some shy men will find it in them to do what needs to be done, but others will miss out on amazing opportunities. Traditionally, men are supposed to court women, but this doesnt help the shy guy.

If you like him, be the one to make a move. You really don't have anything to lose.

<TEXT> A few:

 Adolf Hitler being denied by the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. This forced him to join the military in World War I and his experience in the military drastically shaped his views.

 Franz Ferdinand visiting Sarajevo on the 28th of June, which is Vivdovan, a Serbian nationalist holiday. Serbian nationalists such as the 19 year old Gavrilo Princep (who assassinated Ferdinand) believed that a symbol of foreign imperialism such as their Archduke visiting Sarajevo was an unacceptable insult.

 When Mark Sykes of the British Empire and Francois George-Picot of France drew a straight line putting various extremely polarized ethnic, political, and religious factions all in the same country, and forcing them to get along. Guess the country(ies).

Spoiler Alert: It was these.


This one action probably caused most of the turmoil we see in the region today.

 In 1347, a single ship from Caffa traveled to Sicily and infected rats, fleas, and people spread the plague all across Europe, causing as many as a third of Europes population to succumb to the disease. This paved the way to the end of Feudalism and eventually the rise of industrialism, as lower populations did allow the social order to be slightly more egalitarian. There was more land to be owned (Because everyone was too dead to farm it) so poorer farmers became estate owners over time. This also reformed European notions of disease, paving the way to the European Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution.

 Constantine Is conversion to Christianity after his vision at the Battle of Milvian Bridge caused Christianity to become the most influential religion in the world, and also inadvertently caused the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.

 (Note: This is the most far out one) Julius Caesar, created the Roman Empire. Rome conquered several parts of Asia Minor and unified the southern-most territories and Northern Africa, which made the region ripe for conquest for the Caliphates of the Middle East. Fast forward a millennia or two and then you have the Ottomans, which quasi-started World War I, which triggered World War II, jumping the US and USSR to superpower status, and created the turmoil in the region today (Told ya it was far out). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ethereum is the Closest Thing to Actual Magic in the Real World

Ethereum is the Closest Thing to Actual Magic in the Real World
Before you begin I need to inform you, dear reader, that I am a serious nerd and what follows is a double dose of nerdage that you may never recover from. Consider yourself warned.

As a kid I played Dungeons   Dragons and Magic: The Gathering. I read plenty of fantasy books and watched my fair share of anime. Dragons, medieval weapons, and sorcery occupied far too much of my time and I, like many other nerds out there, desperately wanted something like magic to be real. I would daydream about being able to channel some form of magical energy to cast spells, summon creatures, and control objects around me. Sadly, in the real world, nothing like that existed.

Until now.

Ethereum is pretty magical, and its not just that their logo resembles a Magic: The Gathering expansion set symbol:

zendikar-ethereum

Ethereum is a cryptocurrency that, like other cryptocurrencies, allows you to transfer tokens to and from accounts on a decentralized ledger. In Bitcoin those tokens are (obviously named) bitcoins, and in Ethereum those tokens are ether. But Ethereum lets you do something else. Ethereum allows you to create and deploy smart contracts. Once deployed these smart contracts exist in the Ethereum space where people and machines can interact with them.

And this is where it gets really cool. Deploying a smart contract is like casting a spell. You write up the contract in an arcane magical language (one of the Ethereum programming languages which have esoteric names like Solidity, Serpent, Mutan, and LLL), and summon it into existence. This conjuring requires the use of ether, a magical fuel much like mana in Magic: The Gathering.

Seriously, its just like magic.

An Ethereum contract is like an enchantment or artifact that anyone can call by sending it ether. People, machines, web services, and anything with a connection to the Internet can interact with the smart contracts that exist on the Ethereum blockchain, a realm that no one entity can control and that is always available because it lives as a decentralized system on thousands of computers around the world. And if you dont want to share your masterful spellcraft with the rest of the world you can lock your contract down so only you can use it.

So what kind of things can you do with smart contracts? Just about anything you are clever enough to code up! You can build a contract for your clan of wizards to pool your ether and store your covens by-laws, book of shadows, and facilitate proposals and voting (known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, in the parlance of the non-magical world). Instead of relying on secret handshakes and passwords for entry to your clandestine meetings, you can use a contract to verify membership (in the mundane world this can be used to authenticate online users or control access rights to buildings and rooms like key cards). You can create your own cryptocurrency (your own magical energy) with your own rules governing it. You can create contracts that create other contracts (spells that create new spells). If youre really ambitious you can even create an entire magical world in a contract for others to interact with.

If youve stuck with me so far youre probably itching for something tangible, perhaps an example of what one of these spells looks like. Here is a quick example of a contract written in the Solidity programming language that lets the wizard cast a pretty badass spell:

scroll-code

Okay so Im being a little vague on the exact details of the badass wizardry part of the spell, but this post isnt really about the Solidity programming language so thats all you get for now. However I can tell you a little something about this particular contract. Once it has been created on the Ethereum network only the sorcerer who originally cast it can use it. If any other wizard tries to use it, it will just take their ether and do nothing. The contract also allows the original caster to destroy it if and when he/she wishes.

While you can easily create stand-alone contracts like the one above the greatest value will come from contracts that interact with the real world through mobile and web apps, Internet of Things (IoT) embedded devices, and contracts that interact with other smart contracts in the Ethereum space.

Ill leave you with a word of caution in case you get inspired to build something with Ethereum and look to pitch your idea to investors. Modern finance may be a twisted black art, but VCs dont take too kindly to talk that sounds of witchcraft and Harry Potter. Stick to phrases like FinTech and disruptive innovation and your pitch will go over much smoother. Its important to remember that Ethereum is cutting edge technology and it should be treated as such, especially when large sums of money are on the line.

But dont worry, despite your tech and business jargon deep down youre really a badass crypto sorcerer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course, you can't assume every mildly creepy person has a cold, dark heart. Some people have been through the ringer in life, and are simply trying their best to interact. As long as no one is getting hurt or upset, then the only thing you can do is tip your hat and walk away. But what about truly bad people? Like, the ones who are "out to get you"? Below are some signs to watch out for so you can steer clear, and keep yourself safe.

1. They Take Pleasure In Other People's Misfortune


You trip and they laugh hysterically. There's bad news on TV, and they get out the popcorn. This, um... happy reaction to other people's misfortune is known as schadenfreude. It's defined as "exquisite joy and smug satisfaction from contemplating and reveling in the misfortune of others," according to Adrian Furnham, Ph.D. on Psychology Today. Pretty creepy, to say the least.

2. They Make You Feel... Strange


Bad people  AKA those who don't have your best interests at heart  can give off some mighty weird vibes. It can be so strong, in fact, that your intuition kicks in and tells you to GTFO. "If something feels off or if a 'friend' makes you feel uncomfortable, trust your gut... Intuition is a powerful force that should never be ignored," said Michele Corvi on HuffingtonPost.com. I couldn't agree more.

3. They Are Mean To Animals


Anyone who is mean to animals sucks. There's no doubt about that. But did you know that it's almost always a predictor of deeper issues? "Since the 1970s, research has consistently reported childhood cruelty to animals as the first warning sign of later delinquency, violence, and criminal behavior," noted Joni E. Johnston, Psy.D., on Psychology Today. Whether the cruelty happened 30 years ago, or five minutes ago, take it as a clear sign that this person is bad news.

4. They Use Humor To Insult You


There's nothing funny about being a complete jerk, and yet jerks tend to use humor to knock others down. Think of the classic movie bully who gets the whole school laughing by making someone the brunt of a joke. Not cool.

5. They Lie All The Time


We all tell little white lies  about why we're late to work, or why we're "too busy" to hang out. It's usually no big deal. But evil types take their lying to the next level, and even engage in some expert lying tactics. They might, for example, be super truthful as a way of building people's trust. Then they'll unleash some lies when trying to get their way, according to Jeff Wise on Psychology Today. How incredibly manipulative.

6. They Are Manipulative


Speaking of which, manipulation is another good sign that someone ain't great. And again, these people are very good at what they do. "Manipulators often voice assumptions about your intentions or beliefs and then react to them as if they were true in order to justify their feelings or actions, all the while denying what you say in the conversation," said Darlene Lancer, JD, MFT, on PsychCentral.com. See what I mean? Someone who stoops to those levels is obviously not worth being around.

7. They Belittle Your Fears


Keep an eye out for people who turn your worries into a joke. "If you need a little comfort because you're worried about getting a job or think your best friend is mad at you, [they] shouldn't be mocking your concerns," said Elise Williams on EliteDaily.com. And yet  you guessed it  crappy people probably will.

8. They Don't Feel Guilt Or Remorse


Let's say you were having a bad day and took it out on your partner. Maybe you were kind of cranky, or didn't feel like hearing about their problems. This happens, and is usually followed up by some pretty intense guilt, right? Well, with cold-hearted people, the remorse never comes. "Their brains simply lack the circuitry to process such emotions," wrote Mike Adams on NaturalNews.com. "This allows them to betray people, threaten people, or harm people without giving it a second thought." Yikes.

9. They Have A Total Lack Of Empathy


The type of person who hurts animals, or lies for personal gain, is the same type of person who lacks empathy. This is the ability to feel or share in another persons emotions, according to Susan York Morris on Healthline.com. It ties in with that aforementioned lack of remorse, and can be quite scary.

10. They Are Racist And/Or Sexist


Let me go ahead and address this, while we're on the topic of bad people. Of course racism and sexism are their own separate issues, and they don't need defining. But let's go ahead and agree that people who "indulge" in either one are clearly closed off to the fact that everyone is equal. And that's not OK.

11. They Don't Have Many Friends


This may not come as a huge surprise, but people with all of the above traits won't have many friends. And yet it's not for the reason you might think. Usually, evil people only want friends when it benefits them, according to Marcina Cooper-White on HuffingtonPost.com. So they'll likely push others away, or not make an effort to form friendships, unless it's for person gain. Gross!

If you've reached the end of this list and feel a bit in shock, remember this: there are many reasons people might come across as "evil." They may have suffered some trauma, or they may be struggling with an illness. Not everyone is bad for the sake of being bad, and that's an impotent distinction to make. </TEXT>

The internet has no shortage of travel inspiration lists but how about the absolute best places of nature in the world?

Heres your ultimate nature bucketlist with 17 of the prettiest places in the world

 norway

(source)

1. Preikestolen, Norway

When I first saw a picture of Pulpit Rock (in English), my first question was why have I not been here!? my second question was when can I be here!?. For just a 3-4 hour hike, these are some remarkable rewards.

 

 northern lights

(source)

2. Northern Lights, Northern Scandinavia

While theres no guarantee youll see them if you come all this way, this perhaps just makes it all the more bucketlist worthy. This is likely to already be on your bucketlist, but perhaps this photo will lead you to place it further up the list.

 

 glow worms

(source)

3. Waitomo Glowworm Caves, New Zealand

The glowworms that light up Waitomo cave are unique to New Zealand and create a unique viewing opportunity if pictures can truly tell a thousand words, Ill leave it up to the above photo to convince you!

 

 banff

(source)

4. Banff National Park, Canada

6,641 kilomtres of untouched, pristine beauty in Canadas oldest National Park. Anyone who ventures to Canada should undoubtedly have this one on their list.

 

 argentina glacier

(source)

5. Perito Moreno Glacier, Argentina

It should come as no surprise that Perito Moreno is one of Argentinas most popular attractions. How about that view!!!

 

 uyuni

(source)

6. Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia

When I went to Bolivia earlier this year and wasnt able to make the trip to Uyuni, you could imagine the look of disappointment on my face when I realised I would be missing the very reason I travelled to this country in the first place. But alas, time is on my side and Uyuni remains on my bucketlist.

 

 yosemite

(source)

7. Yosemite National Park, California, USA

If you live in the USA, youll hardly be surprised to learn some of the best National Parks are right there in your backyard. But arguably the best of these (though Yellowstone is similarly jaw dropping) is Yosemite in California. Regardless of the debate, Yosemite is a must at least once in your lifetime.

 

 vietnam

 (source)

8. Ha Long Bay, Vietnam

A UNESCO World Heritage site and Vietnams most popular tourist attraction, Ha Long Bay is as stunning in real life as the images portray. Just be sure to expect crowds (and lots of them), this destination has become a hot spot over recent years. 

 

 angel falls

(source)

9. Angel Falls, Venezuala

Although quite out of the way, a trip to Angel Falls will be all the more special if you are really looking to get off the grid. Be sure to combine a visit with the Amazon and other locations in South America, one of the worlds less-explored regions.

 

 Patagonia Chile

(image: World of Wanderlust)

10. Torres Del Paine, Chile

 Torres Del Paine in the South of Chile is one of the most hiked routes in the world  and its not hard to see why! The W trek lasts 4 days and offers travellers some of the best scenery you will find the world over.

 

 everglades

(source)

11. The Everglades, Florida, USA

 The Everglades are a great day trip for visitors in Florida and will show you just how diverse and absolutely stunning this state is. Florida has much to explore beyond Miami, Orlando and indeed the Everglades, so take a slow pace on holiday here.

 

 lebanon

(source)

12. Jeita Grotto, Lebanon

These limestone caves span nearly 9 kilometres  complete bliss! Lebanon is one of the lesser travelled countries that has so much to offer travellers, so if youre looking to get off the beaten path this is a great place to start.

 

 vietnam (source)

13. Sn ong Cave, Vietnam

This is the biggest cave in the world. Can I just emphasise that once more 

IN THE WORLD.

  australia (source)

14. Great Barrier Reef

Australia on the list? Im sure it comes at no surprise. This country has some of the most natural, untouched scenery in the world  and theres a lot of it! Australia is very sparsely populated and due to its isolated location, its still very undiscovered. To really enjoy your time here, plan for a minimum of 3-4 weeks.

 

 mount everest (source)

15. Mount Everest, Nepal

If youre into hiking or climbing, Nepal is your type of place. There are now more people than ever climbing to the Mt Everest base camp  so dont expect the serenity you might have pictured from novels and autobiographies. But nonetheless, it is still one of the most beautiful scenic locations in the world.

 

 

 national park

(source)

16. Jiuzhaigou National Park, Sichuan Province, China

All the colours of nature merge together here in Jiuzhaigou National Park. This stunning scenery is so surreal that youll be left wondering how real reality is and whether your dreams are indeed even dreams. The closest town to the park is Songpan.

 

 Horseshoe bend

image: World of Wanderlust
17. Horseshoe Bend, Arizona, USA

 Last but not least  a little gem I found in the state of Arizona, just a short drive North of the popular Grand Canyon. Arizona is full of eye candy just like this.
