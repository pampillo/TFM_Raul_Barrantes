<TEXT> Liberals probably continue to govern, either as a minority on in a coalition with the Greens. However, a no-confidence vote would trigger another election, and would probably happen when either the Liberals try to pass something both the Greens and Dippers disagree with, or when both other parties think they can make big gains in an election.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comey was leading an investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russian attempts to interfere in the election. He also appeared unduly critical of Clinton's email practices in an announcement during the election, and announced that they were "re-opening the investigation" four days before the election when emails (that turned out to be irrelevant) were discovered on Anthony Weiner's computer. This was widely believed to have swung the election to trump,  but he may have been given too much blame for the second issue, since it wasn't him who leaked that info.

If Comey was fired to disrupt the investigation that is very, very bad. </TEXT>

Prostitution is legal: Some prostitutes are victims of gangs / pimps. The others are living a rather normal life though, albeit with an unusal job.

 The second option seems to be preferable. 

... if the number of prostitutes are the same. If you trust the data in OP, there are *more prostitutes who are the victims of gangs and pimps* when prostitution is legal. I don't think many would agree that allowing for non-victimizing prostitution is worthwhile if it results in more victimizing prostitution.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not necessarily. The study was performed on fit men under highly controlled conditions. The subjects also reported significantly increased appetite; these results do not suggest whether salt intake would be more (or less) sustainable than simple caloric restriction. 

What they do make clear (if I am reading them correctly)  is that salt intake does not significantly affect water intake or urination, so salt restriction when trying to make weight for competition is probably counterproductive.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [NYT article: Why Everything We Know About Salt May Be Wrong](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/health/salt-health-effects.html)

 The salt equation taught to doctors for more than 200 years is not hard to understand.

The body relies on this essential mineral for a variety of functions, including blood pressure and the transmission of nerve impulses. Sodium levels in the blood must be carefully maintained.

If you eat a lot of salt  sodium chloride  you will become thirsty and drink water, diluting your blood enough to maintain the proper concentration of sodium. Ultimately you will excrete much of the excess salt and water in urine.

The theory is intuitive and simple. And it may be completely wrong.

**New studies of Russian cosmonauts, held in isolation to simulate space travel, show that eating more salt made them less thirsty but somehow hungrier. Subsequent experiments found that mice burned more calories when they got more salt, eating 25 percent more just to maintain their weight.**

[JCI paper one: High salt intake reprioritizes osmolyte and energy metabolism for body fluid conservation](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/88532#SEC3) 

 Natriuretic regulation of extracellular fluid volume homeostasis includes suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, pressure natriuresis, and reduced renal nerve activity, actions that concomitantly increase urinary Na+ excretion and lead to increased urine volume. The resulting natriuresis-driven diuretic water loss is assumed to control the extracellular volume. Here, we have demonstrated that urine concentration, and therefore regulation of water conservation, is an important control system for urine formation and extracellular volume homeostasis in mice and humans across various levels of salt intake. We observed that the renal concentration mechanism couples natriuresis with correspondent renal water reabsorption, limits natriuretic osmotic diuresis, and results in concurrent extracellular volume conservation and concentration of salt excreted into urine. This water-conserving mechanism of dietary salt excretion relies on urea transporterdriven urea recycling by the kidneys and on urea production by liver and skeletal muscle. **The energy-intense nature of hepatic and extrahepatic urea osmolyte production for renal water conservation requires reprioritization of energy and substrate metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle, resulting in hepatic ketogenesis and glucocorticoid-driven muscle catabolism, which are prevented by increasing food intake.** This natriuretic-ureotelic, water-conserving principle relies on metabolism-driven extracellular volume control and is regulated by concerted liver, muscle, and renal actions.

[JCI paper 2: Increased salt consumption induces body water conservation and decreases fluid intake](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/88530)
 A 6-g/d increase in salt intake increased urine osmolyte excretion, but reduced free-water clearance, indicating endogenous free water accrual by urine concentration. The resulting endogenous water surplus reduced fluid intake at the 12-g/d salt intake level. Across all 3 levels of salt intake, half-weekly and weekly rhythmical mineralocorticoid release promoted free water reabsorption via the renal concentration mechanism. Mineralocorticoid-coupled increases in free water reabsorption were counterbalanced by rhythmical glucocorticoid release, with excretion of endogenous osmolyte and water surplus by relative urine dilution. A 6-g/d increase in salt intake decreased the level of rhythmical mineralocorticoid release and elevated rhythmical glucocorticoid release. The projected effect of salt-driven hormone rhythm modulation corresponded well with the measured decrease in water intake and an increase in urine volume with surplus osmolyte excretion.

Humans regulate osmolyte and water balance by rhythmical mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid release, endogenous accrual of surplus body water, and precise surplus excretion. </TEXT>

 like what the fuck do you want us to do, seriously? You can't claim to be an ally if you're going to say we can't use the methods that help us, just because of a minor inconvenience to you. You don't have learning difficulties, you can get the fuck over it and leave us to do the things we need to get on with our lives.

I think they were pretty clear - use a fidgeting tool that isn't unnecessarily distracting to other students. Saying people ought to "get the fuck over it and leave you to do the things you need to get on with your lives" simply because they don't have a (diagnosed) developmental disorder is an awfully rude thing to say, to somebody who was frankly quite understanding and is ADHD themselves.

Education in classroom and lecture hall environment is already extremely challenging and requires cooperation from everybody, including people who aren't neurotypical.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking for an LGA-2011 or LGA-2011v3 platform to upgrade my gaming computer to a hybrid gaming/science workstation. There are two setups on local Craigslist:


Component | PC 1| PC 2
---|---|---
CPU | Core i7-3930k at 4.5GHz | Core i7-4930K at 4.2Ghz 
Motherboard | ASUS Rampage Gene IV x79 | ASUS P9X79 LE
Cooling |  Corsair h100 GT | Corsair H110
RAM | 4x4GB | 8x8GB DDR3-1866Mhz
PSU | XFX XTR-750 | Silverstone Strider 1200W
Case | Corsair ATX case | Corsair Carbide Air 540
GPU | GTX 780 Gaming 3G | No GPU
SSD | No SSD | Samsung 840 Evo 120GB
Asking | $950 CAD | $1100 CAD

I'm more interested in the second system since I can make use of the SSD and huge amounts of RAM and I don't really need GPU (I'll be using crossfire R9 285s,) but that asking price seems steep. What would be a fair offer? How about System #1?  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Is it because the convection from the oven dries the food out more than the microwave radiation does?

This is a big part of it. Microwaves heat most of the food evenly (assuming even distribution of moisture and fat,) and food in a microwave is typically covered to prevent mess, which also tends to prevent liquid from escaping. Because the container and the air in the microwave aren't heated, the moisture will evaporate, then condense on the container or the surface of your food.

Ovens expose the outside of food to high heat for long periods of time, which (by design) cooks the outside of the food more thoroughly than the inside, and the hot air whisks away moisture from the food's surface, leaving a crispy, tasty texture without drying out the inside of your meal.  </TEXT>

Purebreds are often highly inbred, which obviously causes problems and puts them at significantly higher risk of genetic defects and other inherited diseases.

Aside from that, since selective breeding occurs outside of natural evolution, a lot of pure breeds have health issues related to the traits they are bred for - for example, bulldogs [frequently have breathing issues and have trouble mating or giving birth due to their stocky frames.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/although-purebred-dogs-can-be-best-in-show-are-they-worst-in-health/) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But, like - do these people think that if this bill passes, they'll just move on and people won't be talking about health care anymore?

This bill won't pass the senate, though.  It will bounce back and forth between the houses for a long time, and eventually either dropped or revised into something workable and passed.

The point of tabling this bill now and passing it through the house is to get a good news cycle and look like they are doing their jobs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  2) Think the bill will actually be good policy, and all the hate we are seeing for it now will dissipate once its enacted.

 3) Think the bill is bad policy, but think the electoral effects of not passing it are still worse than passing it.

A little of #2 and a lot of #3. The bill (in it's current form) will not pass the Senate, but if it passes the House, the Republicans will have (what appears to be) a badly-needed legislative success. They can workshop the bill into something passable later. </TEXT>

All those pathetically eager freaks who thought they could buy Winning and Greatness for three bucks a hit. But their loss and failure is ours too. What Trump took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create... a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential mystic fallacy of the Trump Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - had a fucking clue what they were doing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are confusing support for unauthorized **immigrants** with unauthorized **immigration.** Support for stronger boarder controls and immigration reform are popular - these would ideally decrease the amount of illegal immigration (and make legal immigration easier.) But support for immigration reform and boarder controls does not mean support for deporting unauthorized immigrants.

[Undocumented immegrants make up 3.5% of the US population and 5% of the US workforce, and a majority of the undocumented immigrant population has lived in the United States for over ten years.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/03/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/)

Deporting 11.1 million people would be **hugely** disruptive and, frankly, cruel. We're talking about separating people from their families (including possibly their children, who would have citizenship by birthright if they were born in the US,) their employers and/or employees, their, friends, their landlords or their mortgages, etc. Why? Essentially out vindictiveness - [undocumented immigrants have a net positive impact on both the economy and government finances.](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/203984-illegal-immigrants-benefit-the-us-economy) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I genuinely do not understand the huge fear of increasing the minimum wage. I certainly see immediate drawbacks, but I don't understand why minimum wage doesn't increase to reflect inflation. 

There isn't a huge fear of increasing the minimum wage. However, beyond certain point an increased minimum wage will cause job or business losses that outweigh the benefits of increased pay for low-wage workers. In particular, it is thought that raising the minimum wage to $15 presents a serious risk to the low-income and low-cost-of-living regions of the United States (source is in the drama.) 

Also, a majority of economists think that subsidies such as an expanded [earned income tax credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit) would be more effective than a high medium wage, since they would not depress the market for unskilled work and can be need-based (the EITC is currently much larger for those with children.) However, some folks on the left dislike this idea because they see it as the government covering for Evil Large Corporations who underpay their workers, and many folks on the right are uncomfortable with blatant wealth redistribution.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Soldiers can wear several layers of armor, though this would make them move slower.

 It doesn't seem counterintuitive to me that dwarves can wear multiple layers of armor. This is dwarves we're talking about, mobility is a distant second consideration behind turning oneself into a medieval battle tank.

It makes sense that flexible materials can be layered, but it seems unlikely that multiple suits of [plate armour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rustning,_Gustav_Vasa_-_Livrustkammaren_-_32921.tif) could be worn while maintaining any flexibility. It would be much better to simply use thicker (or more riged/textured) plates and/or additional leather and mail layers - plate is already nearly impenetrable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   Your implication is that races and sexes are intrinsically opposed to each other. 

Not at all. I happen to be white and male, and I certainly don't oppose myself or my female friends and colleagues. 

 Slavery was (and is) a class distinction. 

A distinction that (in the US) created a special bottom class for black people. 

 Jim Crow was an intentional system to keep blacks in a lower social and economic class, imposed by upper-class whites to hoard more wealth and power for themselves.

Themselves and the other non-blacks. 

Look, I don't disagree with you that economic issues are important. I just

a) Don't think that they are more important than guaranteeing basic human rights for women, minority races, and the LGBTQ community. Your right to more money is not more important than a transgender person's right to a washroom or a black dude's right to not get fucking shot. 

b) Don't think it's a wise strategy to alienate minority voters, as they while they reliably lean left-of-centre, they may very well not turn out if they are sold out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Reddit, right now, isn't advertiser friendly

And CSS is to blame? No.

Not directly. 



Reddit's demographics are overwhelmingly young, white, male, tech-savvy, and impatient - people likely to use adblockers, have good bullshit detectors, and not have a lot of disposable income.

Again, not CSS's fault. 

Again, not directly. 

 Reddit isn't North Korea. It doesn't seem like Reddit is even remotely listening to it's user base. This change is a horrible, horrible idea. By all means, redesign your site. Create a new system. But do not take away the functionality that is without a doubt better for a CSS platform over something like a Wix system which I'm projecting they're going to implement. 

Reddit doesn't care about it's userbase because *Reddit's userbase isn't making Reddit money.* 

Paraphrasing Spez,

 1. To make Reddit easier to use generally
2. To make Reddit more inviting to new users
3. To increase dev speed. Reddit runs on a lot of old code, and development in the current code base is painfully slow.

We don't know a whole lot about the changes, but I strongly suspect they will be geared towards 

a) Greatly reducing the technical knowledge required to make page customization (remember user pages are coming soon.)

b) Eliminating the ability to make bonafide eyesores or interfere with basic functionality. (I would consider the custom "users" and "users online" names to be interfering with functionality, and CSS allows removing ads, etc.) 

c) Allowing better ad delivery, probably including adblock evasion.

c) is self-explainatory, and a) and b) could go a long way towards attracting a more advertiser-friendly userbase. The difference between Facebook and Reddit are 1) Old people use Facebook, and 2) Facebook makes a shitload of money, despite regular, unpopular interface changes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How about just use what is already there?

Reddit only earned [about twenty million dollars](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2016/04/29/report-reddit-falling-short-on-revenue-may-close-content-aggregation-site-upvoted/) in revenue this year. Between their approximately one hundred employees, San Francisco office space, and server hosting, I doubt Reddit even breaks even. 

 Killing CSS will actually do the opposite of make money by limiting communities, which are the product being sold.

Reddit, right now, isn't advertiser friendly. Reddit's demographics are overwhelmingly young, white, male, tech-savvy, and impatient - people likely to use adblockers, have good bullshit detectors, and not have a lot of disposable income. To make money, Reddit needs to get a wider (not deeper) userbase and better tools to deliver advertising. Reddit is well-entrenched and not likely to use many users unless the new system is horrible, and reddit can afford to lose some of its current users. It's the sixth most visited website in the US and still can't make money.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Bell's Theorem,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem#Importance_of_the_theorem) which has been rigorously tested, states that quantum mechanics cannot be made deterministic locally:

 In a theory in which parameters are added to quantum mechanics to determine the results of individual measurements, without changing the statistical predictions, there must be a mechanism whereby the setting of one measuring device can influence the reading of another instrument, however remote. Moreover, the signal involved must propagate instantaneously, so that such a theory could not be Lorentz invariant.

<TEXT> After doing extensive research, she booked a National Geographic tour with New York-based Lindblad Expeditions.

 It included a round-trip Air Canada flight from Toronto to Miami. In Miami, she would meet up with the tour group and continue on to the Galapagos, off the coast of Ecuador. Everything had been booked more than two months in advance.

...

Meanwhile, the tour company has come through with a promising offer. CBC News contacted Lindblad Expeditions and explained why Russell missed her cruise.

The company said it will book another expedition for Russell, covering all costs except her flight to Miami.

As they should. The tour company failed to deliver her to her to her $10,000 cruise by buying bargain-bin tickets.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The customer did his part in paying for a seat and arriving on time, but because the airline screwed up, said passenger ended up being assaulted.

Overbooking isn't "screwing up," it's standard practice.  [Only about eight in ten thousand passengers are bumped from flights, despite overbooking by about 5%.](https://www.airhelp.com/en/blog/why-airlines-overbook-220/) And just over [one in every twenty thousand passengers are **involuntarily** bumped from flights,](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2017/03/20/hold-onto-seat-us-airlines-bump-fewest-passengers-two-decades) since nearly always somebody is happy to take the money. 

The fact is, you **agree** that you may be bumped when you buy a plane ticket, and refusing to leave your seat if asked to is both illegal and unreasonable to the airline, your fellow passengers, and the police (who must then remove you forcibly.) There is nothing wrong with overbooking; for every person who needs to accept a fat cheque and wait for their flight, dozens are able to buy a seat that would have been left empty if the flights weren't overbooked. It sucks this guy wasn't able to fly, and it's horrible that the air marshals mistreated him the way they did, but United Airlines didn't do anything wrong. 

Edit: Wrong numbers fixed  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Copying my response from last month -

 We don't have any codified reason to ban Breitbart. None. They're biased, but we don't ban biased sources. They have ties to the Trump administration, but we have no rules against campaign sites for example. If you can think of new objective source guidelines that could be used feel free to pitch them, but in the meantime, it breaks none of our guidelines.

This gets brought up every month - can we at least have an open discussion about banning low-quality sources? An objective criteria could be difficult to come up with, but I think even a list (pulling from left-wing and right-wing sites) would be supported by the subreddit and help clean up the front page.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  He may just be an untalented uncharasmatic bum that just looks like a superhero. 

Roman puts on awesome matches but isn't quite charismatic enough to not look silly reciting bad lines. The other problem is that his character comes off as a total douche bag much of the time (in one promo he said that Finn Balor, who is Irish, had "tator tots" instead of "potatoes,") but is constantly booked as a face - he gets to feud with all of the top heels, including Triple H (who is (legitimately) the COO now) at Wrestlemania last year, the Undertaker this year, Lesnar two years ago, etc.

It seems like the WWE wants to have it both ways now, with him being a face to kids (who love his merch because he looks like a superhero) and adults (who will buy tickets to boo him.) It's frustrating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't find it harder than Portal (though I suppose it probably would be if you played it first) - in particular I thought the slow difficulty ramp-up at the beginning of the game was very disappointing, since all of the first few puzzles could be solved by simply remembering tricks from the first game. I also didn't like the shinier art style, and although it was longer I still wasn't happy about paying full retail for a seven hour long game.

I was most disappointed by the abrupt tone shift from sci-fi horror with black humour to full-on comedy (though I'll admit it was hilarious at times,) especially considering the games ostensibly take place in the same universe as Half-Life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  And, that although a cause and effect relationship between neonic pesticides and CCD has not been found, an association does in fact exist, suggesting that it is an actor in a bigger picture. A link about the affects on genes:

 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116315482

That neonicotinoids can damage bees is fairly well-known, but (as you noted) it still hasn't been shown to cause CCD (a [widely-cited study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118748) that treated actual bee colonies with "realistic" doses of imidacloprid showed no effects and certainly no CCD.)  

But you're right, it's still a suspect and could be one of many contributing factors. 

I would add though, that there are in fact papers that have found links between land use and management, particularly monoculture agricultural land, and bee biology and varroa infestations. I've attached one,it definitely needs further research, but the volume of research areas has expanded to the point where everyone is looking at something different.

http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153531

This is definitely interesting, I wasn't aware of that.

All this beeing said, it's probably worth noting that US [commerical bee populations are stable and rising,](https://www.perc.org/sites/default/files/US%20honeybee%20colonies.jpg) and I am not aware of convincing research showing wild bees are in much trouble.  </TEXT>

True, but I wanted to highlight that neither monoculture farming nor pesticide use have been conclusively linked to CCD (in fact CCD is definitely not acute pesticide poisoning) and that there are other theories, especially varroa mites and migratory beekeeping.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Entrapment is when the actions of a law enforcement officer causes you to commit a crime that you most likely would not have commuted otherwise. This is a fact, and is indisputable. 

[Not exactly.](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/person) 

 Entrapment is a defense to criminal charges when it is established that the agent or official originated the idea of the crime and induced the accused to engage in it. If the crime was promoted by a private person who has no connection to the government, it is not entrapment. A person induced by a friend to sell drugs has no legal excuse when police are informed that the person has agreed to make the sale.

The rationale underlying the defense is to deter law enforcement officers from engaging in reprehensible conduct by inducing persons not disposed to commit crimes to engage in criminal activity. In their efforts to obtain evidence and combat crime, however, officers are permitted to use some deception. For example, an officer may pretend to be a drug addict in order to apprehend a person suspected of selling drugs. On the other hand, an officer cannot use chicanery or Fraud to lure a person to commit a crime the person is not previously willing to commit. Generally, the defense is not available if the officer merely created an opportunity for the commission of the crime by a person already planning or willing to commit it.

The officers did not force or persuade OP to assault them with their vehicle. They

1. Observed a (licensed but given the antilag almost certainly not street legal) racing car in town they probably don't recognize. 

2. Decide to shadow the car to see if they are in town to street race (reasonable) 

3. ~~Decide to~~ Tailgate OP, either because they are bad at shadowing (possible) or to see if OP races away from them (also possible and illegal but still not entrapment.) 

OP decides to assault them with his vehicle. The cops did not procure this crime from them at all, they merely gave him the opportunity to act like a reckless idiot. The cops were incompetent or stupid but absolutely did not entrap OP. 

 You're having real trouble with this concept aren't you? 

Why so rude?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Now you are not exactly wrong. Electric motors are significantly more efficient (you're right that they can *in principle* be up to 97% efficient, but were talking ~80% for electric vehicles) than ICEs (about 20%) or turbofans (about 30%.)

However, these do not even come close to making up for the difference in fuel energy density. An electric motor may get 3-4x more omph out of a joule of stored energy, but that joule in batteries weighs fifty times as much as a joule of kerosene. So, you still need to carry about 12 pounds of batteries for every one pound of hydrocarbon fuel.

 The large trucks of tomorrow will probably use hydrogen fuel cells, since hydrogen has a similar energy density to gasoline. The planes of tomorrow... well, I'm not sure.

<TEXT> First off its kinda homophobic to call being gay a 'lifestyle'

When desire is transformed into an identity with cultural traits and consumer habits then it's a lifestyle.

 I'm a sexual minority not some edgy kid going through a phase.

The entire history of Whites is an edgy kid going through a phase. Let's just hope you grow the fuck up before you end up murdering the rest of us like you almost did in your world wars.

  You get what you put into this world, you want to treat me like a sex offender and campaign for the criminalization of homosexuality then you can get fucked for all I care.

Girl, I'm not interested in the criminalisation of homosexuality. I want to dismantle Western conceptions of desire altogether and the identities that come with them. It's not my problem that this thread is filled with a bunch of Protestant-lite Muslims.


You spit in my eye and then expect me to turn around and support your rights, nice try not falling for it.

There's a kink joke here, but I don't want to upset the mods with my vulgarity

Also, the White homosexuals have never been supportive of communities of colour or faith, queer or otherwise. I don't seek your support or validation.

Fun facts: Foley also went through the top of the Cell (apparently this was an accident!) and ended the match with missing teeth, a large tear across his face, a concussion, a dislocated jaw, and a dislocated shoulder.

<TEXT> I'm gonna come clean and clarify that I have not played Gone Home. I accidentally got spoiler-ed while reading Gamespot's games-of-the-year coverage. I did, however, play and love Dear Esther.

I think Dear Esther did push the envelope significantly. While you are right - environmental storytelling certainly isn't new and might have peaked with Half-Life 2, Metroid Prime, and Shadow of the Colossus in the Gamecube/PS2 era - motivating exploration with subtle storytelling rather than mechanical rewards was a bold decision in 2012.

<TEXT>  OK, 'at all' is a bit harsh; but definitely I think that the likes of Gone Home are pretty superficial as games, **they don't engage much with the potential of games as a medium** or with the cultural mainstream of game mechanics. It seemed like they got the attention and the credence as 'art games' they did mainly because they dealt with "artsy" themes; I think Yoko Taro (or Papers Please) are more genuine in that respect.

I don't really understand this type of thinking at all. I don't think there's any reason to cling to the mainstream of game mechanics when there's no need to. 

Obviously, work like Dear Esther, Gone Home, Everyone's Gone to the Rapture, etc, do something - a lot of people like them, quite a lot, and they wouldn't work as movies, novels, or paintings. Why do they have to justify themselves with more gameplay? 

If anything, I think Gone Home or Dear Esther utilize  the medium better than a number of cinematic shooter or action/adventure wannabe movies with some superficial gameplay tacked on.  </TEXT>

**Perspective | The center cannot hold in the Trump White House**

By Daniel W. Drezner

(Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular contributor to PostEverything)

The hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts was working hard in the federal government during the changeover between the Clinton and Bush 43 administrations. Observing that transition was a fascinating anthropological moment.

It would be safe to say that most of the Bush appointees came in thinking that the Clinton administration had screwed up 90 percent of policy and that the permanent bureaucracy was allied against them. Eventually, however, most of them learned two basic facts. First, on 90 percent of policy, the status quo was the status quo for a very good political or strategic reason. Second, the permanent bureaucracy was staffed with very smart people who would improve the implementation of any sensible policy shift if they were properly consulted. Different appointees took different lengths of time to reach these conclusions, but they usually got there.

And now we come to the mind-set of Trump administration appointees. Earlier this week we had Kellyanne Conway suggest that the Obama administration could have been monitoring Trump Tower via the microwave oven. Conway isnt alone in this kind of conspiracy theorizing among Trump administration appointees. If this Politico story by Alex Isenstadt and Kenneth Vogel is any guide, theyve actually become more, not less paranoid during their short time in power:

A culture of paranoia is consuming the Trump administration, with staffers increasingly preoccupied with perceived enemies  inside their own government.

In interviews, nearly a dozen White House aides and federal agency staffers described a litany of suspicions: that rival factions in the administration are trying to embarrass them, that civil servants opposed to President Donald Trump are trying to undermine him, and even that a deep state of career military and intelligence officials is out to destroy them 

Its an environment of fear that has hamstrung the routine functioning of the executive branch. Senior advisers are spending much of their time trying to protect turf, key positions have remained vacant due to a reluctance to hire people deemed insufficiently loyal, and Trumps ambitious agenda has been eclipsed by headlines surrounding his unproven claim that former President Barack Obama tapped his phone lines at Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign.

One senior administration aide, who like most others interviewed for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the degree of suspicion had created a toxicity that is unsustainable.

That last word is the key one. The effect of this degree of paranoia among political staffers is debilitating to any kind of successful policy implementation. To put it bluntly, they cant rely on experts to check their work. The first attempt at an immigration ban highlighted the effects of such a narrow policy shop: badly drafted executive orders, confusing implementation, and eventually, rejection by the judicial branch. The Justice Department had to rely on a single lawyer to make the case for the revised immigration ban in court cases in Maryland and Hawaii.

The Trump White House could respond to this in one of a few ways. First, they could persist in their paranoia. This would lead to a narrow coterie of officials trying to run the government amid massive leaking and bureaucratic resistance. If this is their standard operating procedure, theyre going to screw up repeatedly. This will lead to more bad press, which will lad to more leaks trying to shift the blame to others, which will only increase the paranoia further. As feedback loops go, its a really bad one.Eventually, however, through attrition, learning, and staffing up, they will approach basic competency.

Second, they could try to outsource any significant policy plans to Congress and let them draft the legislation. Of course, if the American Health Care Act is any guide, it wont be terribly popular either.

Third, they can learn that the bureaucracy isnt necessarily their enemy and stop acting all paranoid. The dirty truth, however, is that power is so balkanized in the Trump administration that even the Trump appointees dont trust each other. Given the personnel machinations going on right now, many Trump staffers have good reasons to be fearful.

My money is on paranoia winning the day. Which means we are in for at least a year of crazy policymaking, following by one of two things: mass resignations, or a truly America First bureaucracy.

Buckle up. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Government can make laws to force Pharma to lower prices. Insurance can't. The problem is Gov has no incentive to do that, but if Gov is footing the bill they are suddenly incentivized to provide cheaper drugs. Gov can threaten to import drugs from Canada/India as well.

You seem to be assuming that the government has no incentive to reduce the burden on citizens (though deductibles or higher cost to insurence companies and therefore higher premiums,) which is strange. The government isn't some racket that only cares about its bottom line. 

Furthermore, legislating price limits on drugs may well dis-incentivize new drug research, which is very expensive. Material costs of drugs are a very small fraction of pharmaceutical companies' expenses - the overwhelming majority is research, marketing, and education. 

A progressive tax would be much cheaper than insurance on almost every person aside from the uber rich. The main reasons is that every person would be signed automatically, and you'd cut out the middle man of insurance.

Assuming this tax can be effectively administered, this is only more efficient if the government can do a good job of administering health care. It works (reasonably) well in Canada, which has a long tradition of public health care. The (well-regulated) private sector works reasonably well in Switzerland. The middleman isn't just twiddling his thumbs here. 

 Again this is just another product of the US system. Because the Canadian government foots the bill for health care, we are incentivized to attack health care drains like obesity and smoking, as it is in the government's best interest. The US on the other hand has no such incentive and would rather pander to the McDonalds, and Coca Colas, and Marlboro's.

Again, if you assume the government doesn't care about its citizens well-being (or if you must be extremely cynical, the loss of tax base and GDP to preventable illness.) Under a private insurance system the citizens are incentivized directly to take good care of the health.  </TEXT>

This was a bald-faced lie. You also neglected to mention that a significant fraction of those surveyed who believed in Sharia law only believed in imposing it on Muslims. The survey also made no general claims about what "a majority" of Muslims believed - you are inferring from what a majority of in those surveyed did. You are extrapolating broad conclusions from a few regional data points to fit your agenda.

Also, focusing your most incorrect or misleading numbers in your argument is **not** cherry-picking. Contrary to your apparent belief, I was not arguing that no Muslims hold extreme or problematic views, I was simply noting that you were being highly misleading.

Also, noting that you are a liar is not fallacious ad hominum, since that was the premise of my argument.  </TEXT>

a) Inflated scores around release due to sketchy gifted "review copies"

b) Getting poor reviews from outside their target demographic via inclusion in bundles, and

c) Getting review-bombed during free weekends due to GG/SJWism/whatever controversy of the week.  </TEXT>

I understand this argument to a point when it comes to basic functionality, but I don't think you are entitled to a game you *like.* You don't get to return a movie just because you don't enjoy it. 

There should also be a basic understanding that games developed by small teams are simply going to have issues at launch, games that sell terribly aren't going to receive a lot of ongoing support, and that publishers are allowed to be a bit misleading in their marketing (in a "Cumberbatch Isn't Kahn" sort of way.)  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Now you're just splitting hairs. Most folks in the LGBT community don't care about dated comments like that at all.... these are the kinds of things LGBT folks care about. No one is going to say well he's put his career on the line defending our rights, but look at that awful joke he made all of that time ago!

No, I'm not splitting hairs. There is a huge difference between opposing marriage equality on religious grounds and expressing general hatred towards a persecuted minority group. 

 That's my point, if you're looking for a squeaky clean candidate you're going to have a bad time. None of them exist, and this mindset is why we can never have anyone good. You have half the Dems thinking Bernie is disqualified for taking a honeymoon in soviet Russia and the other half forgot how homophobic this country was 10 years ago.

I disagree. Obama was squeaky clean; Clinton lost the election because she talked to bankers and used a private email server. Bernie would have lost the election because he had some nice things to say about socialist dictators and a wrote an essay about women wanting rape. For the record, I'm sure Sanders would have been a good president and Clinton would have been a great president - but it's more important to get somebody elected at this point, and we shouldn't start with somebody who needs to apologize for hateful comments.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Hillary had some choice words about the definition of marriage and that didn't stop her from garnering LGBT support.

Sure, but there's a lot of space between a Christian commenting on the traditional Christian definition of marriage and "not liking the homosexuals" and using homosexual as a slur. FWIW, I also don't think Gabbard is a good idea.

 LGBT folks care more about what a politician will do to protect their rights, not some cherry picked quote from another time period. I do see where you're coming from though. 

Honestly, if anything is clear after this last election its that it is far more important for the Dem. candidate to be **squeaky** clean than to have experience and accomplishments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, each of the nodes have two six-core Westmere Xeon CPUs, 24 GB of RAM, and three Tesla M2070 GPUs. 

Those CPUs are similar to a Core i7-970 underclocked by about 20% - that should be no problem - and each one of those GPUs are full-sized but low-clocked Fermi chips, so about the equivalent of a severely undervolted GTX 480. 

So, since Crysis runs on Linux natively now, you should be able to comfortably run Crysis on each of the sixty CUDA-capable nodes. Of course, they don't have any display ports or I/O aside from InfiniBand, so there would be some serious latency issues... </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There seems to be a lot of disdain for people who label themselves as Atheists on SRD which is odd as, going by the statistics, it seems like atheists/ non-religious people are far more likely to share the kind of views that people on SRD have, ex. being pro LGBT, tending towards left wing, and being pro choice. It's true that Atheists have a generally dim view of religious people, but more often than not that view is still higher than the respective religious peoples view of atheists.

I think that's because people who label themselves as Atheists (with a capital "A") tend to be the ones who are condescending and obnoxious at best, and misogynistic, racist, or social Darwinist at worst, and they don't want to be associated with those people. 

To me, there isn't much of a reason to make atheism a part of your identity except to laugh at religious people. (And most of the time, "religious" is "rural, non-white, and/or lower-class.") </TEXT>

And now he's feuding with Baron Corbin, who also badly needs wins. Corbin should have beaten the Miz for the IC and then dropped it to Ambrose at Mania.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Also very true! Although I'm not sure if they use Intel or AMD I would imagine they use supercomputers based off of something else. But yeah they would be huge customers

Nearly all medium-to-large large computing facilities use Intel, and most of the remainder use AMD. It is usually much easier and cheaper to use modular, multi-socket nodes with x86-x64 CPUs (and CUDA GPUs) than specialized hardware. Most of the highest-performing use [Haswell-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500#Number_of_systems) CPUs. 

The one I use for my work uses [Westmere CPUs and Fermi GPUs](https://www.westgrid.ca/support/systems/Parallel)  :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> You say "literally" become a monarch. This would mean overthrowing the current government, by your example, by bribing the military, officials, etc. 

Not only would this would require a huge amount of organization  and espionage to set up (you would need to bribe MANY people,) it would [be illegal under US law.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Corrupt_Practices_Act) This would put Gate's personal wealth at great risk, unless he moved it to Somalia, which would cause local [hyperinflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation) - Somalia would still have no local economy, just a huge number of United States dollars.

Finally, Gates can already live like a king. You said it yourself - all of the wealth of Somalia is worth less than a tenth of Gate's - he'd have a happier and more productive life in the United states than in Somalia. And if he wanted more freedom, he could buy a [private island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_island) and get up to anything he wants (that isn't heinously illegal.)

<TEXT> Proprietary software is software that is copyrighted and privately owned, like Microsoft Windows. Most of the code you use on a day-to-day basis is probably proprietary. Generally, you are not allowed to modify or distribute this code yourself - you can't open up Windows and see how it works, and you can't modify if, or sell (or give away) your own TioFrodo Presents Microsoft Windows!

Open-source software has it's source code publicly available, and is free to use, modify, and distribute. Firefox, the GNU compilers, and the Linux kernels are open source.  

[Collaborationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborationism) is collaborating with the enemy against one's own people. **Collaborationist**/*Collaborationniste* typically refers to someone who willingly cooperated with the Nazis in occupied Europe. 

Edit: I'd like to add that both types of software are necessary and valuable. Open-source development is often conducted by hobbyists, academic institutions, or in free time, so quality open-source software takes a long time to mature and is usually limited to academic/technical stuff (like the GNU compilers, Visual MD, etc.) or stuff with a very, very wide userbase (like Firefox.) Stuff that requires a big initial investment or is time-sensitive like triple-A games, or requires confidential code or super-strict version control can't be done open-source. Open source stuff is also often poorly documented and not super user-friendly (being developed mainly by techies without front-office staff.) </TEXT>

If you are suggesting generating new fuel **directly** from sunlight, this obviously isn't practical - the energy required to create new matter is enormous: twenty-five million kilowatt-hours -- or the equivalent of two and a half million litres of gasoline -- per gram.

If you are suggesting creating a plant, algae, or chemical cocktail that can store chemical energy in a way that can be more easily accessed in fewer steps than what we have now (GM corn + GM soy - ethanol + soybean oil - biodiesel,) than I agree. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It isnt as though poor white people are living much better than their minority counterparts.

White people have significantly more upward economic mobility due to [biased hiring practices]( http://www.nber.org/papers/w9873) and a significantly smaller likelihood for arrest, conviction, or disproportionately long prison sentences for drug offences, for example. 

But what is the imperative for changing economic conditions for poor black people, and not just all poor people?

Removing this bias. So long as black people are disproportionately poor, they will be treated poorly. Stereotyping is a problem.  </TEXT>

r/politics isn't really "biased," though. It doesn't have biased moderation or submission policy, it's just a cross-section of the politically active Reddit users, which happens to lean pretty liberal, since Reddit users are mainly 18-30 year old white men.

<TEXT>  When they looked back toward the valley and the distant Gardner place at the bottom they saw a fearsome sight. All the farm was shining with the hideous unknown blend of colour; trees, buildings, and even such grass and herbage as had not been wholly changed to lethal grey brittleness. The boughs were all straining skyward, tipped with tongues of foul flame, and lambent tricklings of the same monstrous fire were creeping about the ridgepoles of the house, barn, and sheds. It was a scene from a vision of Fuseli, and over all the rest reigned that riot of luminous amorphousness, that alien and undimensioned rainbow of cryptic poison from the wellseething, feeling, lapping, reaching, scintillating, straining, and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and unrecognisable chromaticism.

....

  The aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings. The odour arising from the newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared Hawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and everyone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness. </TEXT>

That's because this is only part of the argument. Even if college is tuition-free, most college students will be privileged. Even if they don't have to pay tuition, spending time in college requires money and a safety net, and is likely to increase your income in the future. Thus, free college shifts costs from these privileged people to the general taxpayer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A German capture of Moscow was [unlikely, and would not have likely ended the war.](http://www.historynet.com/what-if-the-germans-had-captured-moscow-in-1941.htm) While the initial attack was shockingly effective, it would be nearly impossible for Germany to defeat the USSR.

However, a German victory over the UK would have eliminated the Western and African fronts and isolated the USSR, eliminating UK and US lend-lease, which accounted for [an enormous amount of the USSR's fuel, ammunition, and vehicles, most critically fighters and heavy tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)#Forces), as well as [critical training.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._151_Wing_RAF)

The invasion of Russia could only have succeeded if Britain was defeated first.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  They have been able to salvage Cena in the last few years by giving him legitimate threats and getting more of the fans behind him. Cena loses now, not regularly, but it allows us to cheer for him and builds great matches. He took a pin when they could have easily gave it to Harper the other night. Reigns "over coming the odds" has hurt him immensely as well as much of the roster.

This is part of it, but Cena is *actually a good face.* He looks like a face, he acts like a face, and "Hustle, Loyalty,   Respect" is a face attitude to a T. When he's not being booked stupid, he's super over.

Reigns looks like a heel, acts like a heel, and "Believe that!" is tweener to heel. 

It's a lot easier to cheer for Hogan 2.0 than for a guy who beat you up in middle school and went on to play pro football.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  He got to face HHH for the title leading into WM. 

Granted

 He had WWE legends hype him in his match against their golden boy, Brock Lesnar.

Yeah, and Lesnar buried him.

 He won MITB and the WWE title the same night, and retained against the two other pushed members of the shield. He held the companies main title through the brand split, and was Smackdown's first pick (ahead of Cena, AJ, and Randy). He had a multi-month war with AJ over the title, and pinned Cena clean at one point.

Granted.

 Just because he's being pushed down the card a little now to allow for the Bray/Randy story to take over doesnt mean he hasnt been pushed. Id say what he received from Roadblock through Summerslam accounts for a pretty monster push. **Misguided choices about his match at WM dont erase that.**

This is what we are talking about though. It's almost CM Punk all over again - Ambrose wrestles the most matches, gets a solid push, and then gets booted out of the way for Reigns last year and gets squashed by Lesnar at Wrestlemania. This year, he gets a big push, makes way for Cena vs AJ at Rumble (fair,) and then looks like he's treading water towards a pre-show match at Mania.

And AJ looks to be getting a garbage match vs Shane (no offense to Shane.) It's frustrating.

<TEXT>  That's not confined to liberalism. Socialists also uphold these values.

I haven't found [this attitude](http://moufawad-paul.blogspot.ca/2012/02/whos-speech-and-for-whom.html) to be uncommon among socialists.

Liberalism is the philosophy that liberty and equality are of paramount importance. 

Socialism is an economic philosophy of social ownership of the means of production, typically motivated by a desire for equality of outcomes, not opportunities, and which typically places less importance on individual freedoms. 

Edit: The link is to a massive wall of text, but the attitude is "I don't care about reactionaries' freedom of speech."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no such thing as unbiased news. Any news source will, at minimum, introduce [selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias), consciously or unconsciously, when they decide what to report on. It's also important to get biased, opinionated content too, because it's impossible for a layperson to do all of their own analysis - the insights of smart people like Paul Krugmen and Charles Krauthammer can go along way. 

So best to get your news from a variety of different sources, and to avoid extremely biased sources like Salon and Brietbart. The best news sources have a full editorial staff and separate their news and opinion sections. I recommend: 

**Soft Paywall:**

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) - hard news, centre-left editorial content

[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) - hard, mostly political news, various (mostly leftist) editorial content

[The Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/) - economic news, various (mostly right-wing/libertarian) editorial content 

**Free**

[BBC News](http://www.bbc.com/news) - hard news

[CBC News](http://www.cbc.ca/news) - hard news, mostly liberal editorial content

[NPR News](http://www.npr.org/sections/news/) - hard news

[Vox](http://www.vox.com/) - leftist editorial content. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  - How it works

 - Who the money goes to

The US borrows money mainly by issuing treasury bonds -- fixed-term, low-interest loans. [Much of this debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#/media/File:Estimated_ownership_of_treasury_securities_by_year.gif) is held by governments, foreign citizens, and banks or mutual funds - anybody who needs to securely invest a large number of US dollars. Famously, the government of China owns many treasury notes, because they tend to have an excess of US dollars from trade, but exchanging these dollars for renminbi would increase the value of renminbi relative to dollars, making it more expensive for the US to import Chinese goods. 

 How much is healthy or not healthy

Typically, a debt-to-GDP ratio below 100% is considered "safe," although there is no hard-and-fast rule. It is obviously not sustainable for the debt to grow faster than the economy, and sustainable economic growth rates and interest rates typically hover around 2%. The US has the advantage of borrowing in a currency it controls, so it is unlikely to face a debt crisis like Venezuela (who borrows in US dollars) or Greece (who borrows in Euros) so it they can borrow quite safely. Whenever borrowing money can stimulate GDP growth at a faster rate than interest on the loan accumulates, it makes sense to do so. 

 - What it would mean if we were "positive" (as in, instead of being $20T in debt, if we had a positive balance. If that makes sense?)

Your question makes sense, but it does not make sense to maintain a cash surplus. It would make more sense to decide how best to spend this money - by improving infrastructure or education, funding scientific research, etc. Cash sitting in a vault somewhere does nobody any good.  </TEXT>

No, it isn't. Luke and Han were

It is murder, not perfidy, for a spy to kill soldiers while disguised in pursuit of other aims, and regardless, Luke and Han were civilians unaffiliated with the Rebel Alliance.  </TEXT>

 Maybe the stock market isn't as bad as I thought. It is a popular mode of investment, and I wish people would more diligent in investing in it. However, it does seem a reliable way to participate in economic growth of a company and even a country itself.

You are correct. Before investing in a company, you should convince yourself it is under good, honest management. Alternatively, you can invest in a mutual or index fund, which will spread your money throughout many different stocks and offer you a slow, reliable return on your investment. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There is a thing called preferred stock. Can the everyday person buy preferred stock? No.

Preferred stock is often issued by a company at risk of going insolvent or having a long period with little cash flow. There are also strict restrictions on which companies can issue preferred stocks - in the US, [mainly banks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_stock#United_States) 

These people get paid dividends first. Even if an amount can pay everybody.

This isn't exactly true. It's more like they get "first dibs" at money, up to a point guaranteed by their shares. Edit: Preferred stocks are more like a mortgage than traditional stocks - they usually allow the company selling them to buy them back at a fixed price, in exchange for "guaranteed" dividend payments that can be deferred once money is available or in the case of insolvency.

Regardless, employees of a company acting against the interests of their stockholders is usually a crime. This obviously happens, but it is not the norm. As somebody else in this thread posted, the value of stocks increase by about 4% per year on average. The stock exchange is an important vehicle that allows people to invest their capital in companies and, on average, make a return on their investment. What would change your view? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I do believe you explain it out well, but it still seems to me like this is all an elaborate way to get money from people.

Thank you.

It it is a way *for the company* to get money.  But it is not a scam, as you are buying a percentage of a real company that does real things. 

 A company can issue my shares with no compensation, all with the hope of profiting from other people in purchasing these "shares."

No direct compensation to you, but the value of your shares haven't changed. They money doesn't go into the voting stockholder's pockets, it goes onto the companies balance sheet. It would be [embezzlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement) to directly route it to employees or individual stockholders.

 All with the hope of profiting from other people in purchasing these "shares".

Could you explain who you believe is profiting here? Stock offers add new cash to a company by allowing new stockholders to buy in. Cash leaves the company through spending, which is geared towards making the company profits in the future, or through stock buybacks or dividends, which you will be party too if you are an investor, even if you don't have voting rights. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, because there are literally millions of shares of large, publicly traded companies. Selling additional shares is simply one of the millions of management decisions that are made every day during the operation of a large company. You agreed to leave the oversight of the company to the board of directors, and the oversight of the board to the voting shareholders, when you bought the stock. It would be impossible to manage the company if each of the millions of individual shareholders had to be consulted. 

And again, the value of your shares haven't changed. If you own a 1% of a $5 million mine, and we double the amount of shares in the company, you now own .5% of a five million dollar mine and .5% of five million dollars. The voting stockholders own stock just like you do, they are doing the best job they can to make you money.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a little bit more complicated. 

If I originally found a company I own one hundred per cent of it. If it needs more cash, I could sell half of it two my sister, and then we would each own half of the company. If it needs even more money, we could publicly incorporate it, and initially offer fifty per cent of the company, lets say five hundred thousand shares, at a fixed initial value, keeping 250,000 shares each for ourselves. Now my sister and I own 25% of the company (125,000 shares) each, and people such as yourself own the remaining fifty per cent.

Now, lets say the company has a good opportunity to expand. The company could borrow the money, or we could sell more stock, let's say another 500,000 shares for ten dollars each. Now, this would dilute both our 25% shares, and the 50% that you and other members of the public own, down to 12.5% and 25%. 

But! The company we own will become more valuable, because it will have another five million dollars under its control, which it will  spend expanding itself. If the ten dollars/share we sold this stock for isn't significantly misvaluing the company (that is, if before the dilution, the company wasn't worth 500,000 shares * $10/share = $5 million dollar company,) the value of a single share should not change much when this happens. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So I don't profit from the value of the company's operations itself, rather value of having a "share" in the company then?

This is correct. Until such a time as Google doesn't need all of its cash to maintain or expand it's operations. It is actually better for you - a successful company expanding typically brings you much more value a stable but profitable company (that pays dividends) would. 

 Isn't it similar to a pyramid scheme, where I rely on others to participate as well?

No. Google actually produces something valuable. You own a percentage of Google, and *Google is valuable.* Non-voting stock, like yours, is typically sold to the general public to avoid needing to consult with a large number of shareholders on corporate decisions, such as managing the board of directors. You still own a percentage of the company.

Let's think of it this way - pretend Google is a mine that sells a valuable ore, and you are one of one hundred and three stockholders. Three major stockholders, who together own 50% of the company, run the business, you are one of a hundred guys who own the rest. 

It is calculated that the mine can run at a small profit, equal to $6000 per thousand tonnes of ore it produces, and the mine produces a million tonnes of ore per year. The three bosses could each get a million dollars, and you and all of your friends could each get $30,000, and everybody would be pretty happy.

However, the bosses also work out that they could double the size of their mine in two years at a cost of twelve million dollars. The owners decide this is a better idea, so that in two years, they can each make $2 million (and you and your ninety-nine buddies can make $60,000) per year. 

This is essentially how Google is operating right now, except they are planning to keep expanding their mine indefinitely.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I have google stock, right? What did I buy exactly?

You bought a percentage of Alphabet, Google's parent company. You own a small percentage of Google. If Google continues to perform well, the value of Google, and your shares, will increase. 

  I don't get any share of the profit even though I am an "owner"?

Google is not paying any dividends - it's using it's cash to service its debt (about $4 billion, I believe,) perform R D, and expand it's services. If Google ever matures (unlikely) and stops expanding, it may pay dividends in the future. If you want your share of Google's success now, cash out and sell your stock.

<TEXT>  So you are saying that Comcast could charge data hogs like Netflix and pass the savings to consumers?

I'm suggesting it's possible. [Netflix paid Virizon for a direct line in 2014,](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/10/since-netflix-paid-verizon-video-speed-on-fios-has-doubled/) which resulted in significantly better performance (not lower prices) for consumers. Netflix greatly benefits from net neutrality laws, obviously, as they are responsible for a huge amount of web traffic. 

  I feel it's theoretically possible, but wouldn't the far more likely outcome be that Netflix increases their prices?

These aren't mutually exclusive. Netflix could pass the cost onto their consumers, and Comcast could pass their savings onto theirs.

The point I'm trying to make is that I see strict net neutrality as a stifling band-aid solution to the larger problem of poor competition in the ISP space. It is [extremely, extremely difficult](http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/04/one-big-reason-we-lack-internet-competition-starting-an-isp-is-really-hard/) to start up an ISP, and unfortunately all current ISPs have additional obligations - they are also cable TV companies, and cable is struggling. These are large, unwieldly beasts not in a position to compete aggressively. However, excessive regulation that tells them how to do their job will not likely make things better. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Are companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT T truly this.evil? 

No. That's silly (and I think you realize that.) They are for-profit corporations doing their best to make their shareholders money. Just like Tesla, EA, and every other company out there.

That being said, I do not think their campaign against internet regulation is necessarily anti-consumer. Capitalism isn't a zero-sum game, and what is good for Comcast is not necessarily bad for you. 

For example, allowing providers to charge extreme bandwidth hogs like Netflix and Google extra could potentially lower costs to consumers, and allowing providers to prioritize data based on it's data type could be transformative - critical tasks could be done remotely, safe from lag spikes, for example.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Noob question here:

I bought a Lynnwood AV-405 amplifier with a Rotel RTC-965 preamp and some speakers on Craigslist for cheap. 

~~The system was demo'd working, but I can't get audio from any input on the Rotel except "Phono," and sound through "Phono" sounds extremely bassy and distorted. As I primarily want to use the setup with my existing speakers and an MP3 player, so it's not a huge deal that I can't get the Rotel working, I'd like to try anyways, as I may want to connect additional components in the future and I'd like the volume control. I have no screen connected to the system, so I cannot see the menu - how to I force it to use the analogue CD input?~~

Edit: I am retarded, volume was set very low. </TEXT>

"Raising the bottom," via negative income tax, greater unemployment insurance, welfare, or something else, helps the people who need help the most.

Better anti-discrimination laws, better primary and secondary education in minority areas, and targeted scholarships.

A significant number of factory jobs in the Midwest have been held by racial minorities.

Do you have a source with stats? (I'm not saying your wrong, I'm interested.)

Also, despite their flaws, there is no evidence that labor unions have made income inequality worse. 

Unions exist to give their in-group as much money as possible. Do you really not think they increase income inequality between union members and non-members?

I don't think so. While it is certainly important to make sure  that college is affordable, college-educated jobs are typically already middle- and upper-class earning. It's more important to raise the bottom than to inflate the middle.

You could replace "allies" with "activists" and it would still be true. There are always some people who will make it all about themselves, whether or not they are part of the oppressed minority.  </TEXT>

This is illegal. The yellow light exists to allow people to finish maneuvers they have already started or cannot safely abort before allowing traffic to flow in the opposite direction. 

This includes clearing the intersection after having started a left turn. This does not include darting out from behind the stop line to beat the light.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Witcher 3 honestly would have been a better game if they'd gutted a lot of the leveling-based stuff and just made Geralt a more static character in terms of power. More like an Ezio from Assassin's Creed or something where as the game progresses you simply start fighting enemies who require more advanced tactics to beat or allow for less room for error rather than it simply being a question of how good your numbers are compared to theirs.

I don't mind Geralt "feeling" more powerful as the game goes on. I just think he didn't - just that enemies felt less challenging, rather than more, and the enemies 'over-levelled' to you felt invulnerable and 'under-levelled' felt pathetic. 

I feel like some kind of character-building system was probably necessary to motivate the open-world and side-questing, but the level system in the game didn't make sense.

I *hated,* the equipment level-gating, though. That is a trope that needs to just die. It felt so arbitrary. Nothing is more demotivating than grinding to *use the gear you already have* rather than to get new skills or equipment. It makes the entire game feel pointless.

He's already had so much experience at what he does and fought so many powerful foes in the past that it makes very little sense for us to have this progression where he starts out fighting wolves and drowners and has to work his way up to being able to take on a cockatrice or an elemental or whatever.

Kinda, yeah. The gear power level never made sense either - entry-level Skellige items are better than ancient elven swords, elite knight armour, and the equipment Geralt starts the game with. 

It all could have been a lot more gradual and you could have started off much less weak. I dunno if it would have worked as a straight action game with dialogue trees, however. </TEXT>

I don't think this is true at all. FPtP produces more majority governments, which would in principle allow the winning parties to pass their agenda. Obstructionism works in the US because it's common for the three branches of government to be split between parties. 

  An electoral system which made it viable for more than two parties to exist in Congress would probably produce more co-operation (outside of circumstances like the one in Spain). 

I think this is awfully optimistic. It doesn't exactly go smoothly in Greece or India either. </TEXT>

While I don't think the Bush tax cuts were a good idea, they didn't exactly "fuck up the country" either. The debt-to-GDP ratio was [actually fairly stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#/media/File:51129-land-summaryfigure1(1\).png) during the Bush years. 

[In the absence of the financial crisis, they [approximately balanced the budget](http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/50eb25216bb3f7a826000005-960/causesofdeficits.jpg) - which is usually a good thing. It's poor practice to run an actual-dollar surplus, even at the best of times. Given the wars and (especially) the financial crisis, they made a large deficit much worse.

 There's no way to spin the recession as anyone's fault other than Dubya and his terrible wartime economic policies.

This is just plain [false](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Great_Recession). The financial crisis was caused primarily by depleted regulations and lax regulation enforcement on lending and security trading, and naive consumers over-borrowing on their homes. "Wartime economic policies" had nothing to do with it. The existing deficit didn't even hamper the large stimuli deployed by the Bush and Obama administration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Games undergo an optimization process to ensure they operate reasonably well on a reasonably inexpensive machines. This involves improvements to the code of the game to make it run more efficiently and avoid unnecessary operations, as well as providing the lower-quality textures and various filters that make up the "video settings" menu in the game. 

During this process they typically target a few different common specs that they want to support well - for example, many games are optimized to use about 3GB of VRAM at their highest 1080p settings, since the GTX 780 is an extremely popular card among 1080p gamers (while 4GB and more is usually necessary for 1440p or 4k.) Of course, it is also important to provide a good experience for everybody using a GTX 680, 770, or one of the various R9 AMD cards with 2GB VRAM.

CPU performance is pretty linear - it's not difficult to ensure the game runs on an i7, i5, FX-8XXX, and FX-6XXX and figure out at what point the game stops working. Most games are optimized to run on 8GB of RAM.

<TEXT> Overclocking a graphics card (or CPU) tells it to run faster by increasing it's [clock speed](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/clock_speed.html). If you increase the clock speed of a part by 15%, it will give you 15% better performance. 

Increasing clock speed isn't really dangerous - it will cause the part to draw more power and create more heat, but graphics drivers nowadays will keep your temperatures under control by reducing the clock speed and increasing the fan speed to prevent the card from overheating. However, you can't just crank up the speed as much as you like, because for various reasons, eventually a card will begin to crash and execute instructions improperly if it is clocked too high. You can squeeze even more overclocking out of a card by improving cooling or increasing the voltages, but higher voltages can shorten the lifespan of the card, so proceed with caution. 

If you buy a "factory overclocked" card like that ASUS, you are buying 

a) A card that is "guaranteed" to run at those clock speeds. You *usually* can achieve the same speeds on a non-overclocked card by increasing the clockspeeds and voltages yourself, but not always. 

b) Often, a card with better cooling.  </TEXT>

And this makes sense. The president represents the entire country - each state should have a say. If it was allocated purely by population, Wyoming, Alaska, Vermont, Alaska, the Dakotas, etc, would all get one vote instead of three - or about .2% of the voting power rather than .6%. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Because if they need to do it, they should be able to do it.

Sure. But this is why Wyoming and Hawaii get seats at the table. So the government doesn't decide to fuck with the states with the smallest populations.

Why not put it in the constitution like they did with the other minorities you mentioned, then?

If discriminating against states was constitutionally forbidden it would create a Supreme Court tangle of biblical proportions.

 So? That's good! Oklahoma, Ohio and Minnesota shouldn't get to take giant shits all over the environment. They should be incentivized to find something better to do.

Fine, but again - those states should be part of the conversation. States aren't arbitrarily defined - they are like countries. They are discrete entities with distinct economies, histories, and cultures. Most joined the union voluntarily. Their federal representation and rights are important and clearly defined. A majority of the US population shouldn't be able to tyrannize small member states any more than a majority of the EU should be able to tyrannize Belgium or Luxembourg. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Whats funny is, I remember in math class, IF you had results that were above a # amount, you could very well SKIP the "10-50%" scale and start with 60% (or 80 in this pictures case) since all would be above that #. Its legit. I don't see anything wrong with it.

Typically you don't do this with bar graphs however. Bar graphs should be used to compare absolute values, and these values should be proportional to the area of the bars.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But why favor this minority and not any of the other infinite other minorities? Why not weight gay Jews 100 times more voting power?

Two reasons. Firstly, the rights of Jews, other religious minorities, and to a much lesser extent, minority sexual orientations, are protected by the constitution. Jews don't get extra rights, because in principle the Constitution protects them from oppression. Nothing prevents the US government from deciding to pave Wyoming or store all of its nuclear waste in Hawaii. To make up for this, Wyoming and Hawaii each get a small amount of guaranteed legislative power that is disproportionate to their populations.

Secondly, states have much, much more disparate interests than most other groups of people. They aren't arbitrary. While the government isn't likely to do anything malicious to a state, it very likely could decide to tax oil production to fund renewable energy research. This could severely harm Oklahoma, Ohio, and Minnesota and benefit California. States were guaranteed certain rights when the joined the union, and this included their legislative and voting power. Reducing their power so you can harm their interests would be unethical (and illegal, since they likely wouldn't surrender that power voluntarily.  </TEXT>

What games are you getting low performance in? That iGPU is underpowered for most PC gaming. That being said:

1. Make sure your BIOS is up to date. MSI has a tool that will do this automatically. ("Live Update," I think?)

2. Make sure this isn't thermal throttling: download [HWMonitor](http://www.cpuid.com/downloads/hwmonitor/hwmonitor_1.30.exe) and check your gaming temps.

3. If your temps are OK, I guess you are power throttling or boost is misbehaving. Go into the BIOS, turn off turbo boost and set the multiplier to x37.

Edit: This [beginner's guide](http://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-overclock-amd-cpu-processor/2/) to OCing that processor should help you get a stable CPU clock, whether you want to overclock or not.

<TEXT> The United States Government owes a very large number of dollars, about $14.3 trillion. A more meaningful answer is that has a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 73% -- that is, it owes about 73% of a year's worth of 'economy.' 

This may seem alarming, but it shouldn't be. Most companies are in debt for their entire existences. Since the US government isn't going anywhere, it can continually issue new treasury bonds and maintain a level of indebtedness forever, so long as it can afford the interest on the debt. 

And the government can borrow at essentially free - a 1-year treasury bond pays .8% interest. People buy these bonds because they are almost perfectly safe investments - if the US Government isn't paying is bills, nobody else is either and you have big big things to worry about. 

Now, that doesn't mean that any amount of debt is safe. Greece and Venezuela can't pay their bills and several countries have gone bankrupt in the past. This happens if your country borrows too much, loses its reputation as a reliable borrower, and is forced to borrow at higher interest rates (to make up for the added risk.) If the interest fees accumulate faster than revenue can be increased and spending can be cut, you get trapped in a "death spiral" and must be bailed out or go bankrupt. What level is safe isn't exactly clear, but it's approximately 100% (since economic growth is generally over 1% and interest rates are around 1%.)

So, in sort, it doesn't effect you directly. What it does effect is how much safe borrowing is "left" for the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  With net neutrality, you can still have a bigger chair for obese persons. You can buy increased bandwidth and/or speed from an ISP and that will not slow down any other customers. If you need speed, you can just buy a bigger bandwidth from the ISP and have your "fast lane".

Sort of. You can buy a higher maximum bandwidth, but that doesn't help you if the network is congested. A better analogy might be a freeway. A higher bandwidth connection would allow you place more cars on the highway at the same time, but it won't get them to their destination any faster. 

Without net neutrality, it would be possible to create HOV/emergency vehicle lanes for time-sensitive cars.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  this is the best argument I've seen so far. A few more questions though.

 Yes debt is an acceptable risk when the payout is worth it but what exactly have we gained from our debt? our infrastructure is failing, our education has been left behind, our middle class is shrinking..etc etc. 

[Here's a brief summary of where the money goes.](https://media.nationalpriorities.org/uploads/budget-graphic.png)

Most government spending isn't easy to cut. We can't stop paying Social Security, lay off a bunch of the military, etc. Government spending, fuelled by borrowing, pays for the military, the education system, Medicare, Medicaid, subsidized housing, food stamps, and etc.

And the debt isn't actually growing very much. As McKoijion summarized (but didn't state explicitly,) the dollar amount of debt doesn't really matter. A better indicator is the Debt-to-GDP ratio, which compares the size of the debt to the economy. If it is growing, the size of the debt is increasing faster than the size of the economy. This isn't sustainable long-term; we're borrowing faster than our ability to repay is growing. 

If it's shrinking, even if we are borrowing more dollars, our ability to maintain the debt is growing faster than the debt is. This is very common in both healthy economies and growing businesses. It's like buying a new factory with a mortgage or borrowing to buy new equipment.  

[Here is a plot of the debt-to-GDP ratio over time.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/51129-land-summaryfigure1%281%29.png) As you can see, it spiked up mostly in times of crisis, like WWII and the Great Recession, where it was important to borrow money to win the war and to save the auto industry and financial system. The heavy borrowing isn't a sign of mismanagement, it's a sign of very bad situations being mitigated as much as possible.

The other big period of growth is Reagan and HW Bush's presidencies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Reddit, I have thirty+ hours of travel time coming up next week and I'm going to need some reading material. I'm not thinking of anything in particular, maybe some sci-fi, horror, and a few short stories. Something Gothic/Southern Gothic would be cool too.

I enjoy, and have read most of: 

- William Gibson
- Raymond Chandler
- H.P. Lovecraft
- Paolo Bacigalupi
- Hunter S. Thompson
- Fyodor Dostoevsky
- R.A. Heinlein
- Stephen King

I dislike:

 - John Scalzi 
 - Patrick Rothfus
 -  House of Leaves
 - Robert J. Sawyer
 - Frank Herbert </TEXT>

<TEXT> I bought a CPU from a fairly new eBayer, and it arrived not working. Naively assuming the seller would be reasonable, I initiated a return without taking pictures of the bios code, and just noted that the processor was not working. When the seller didn't respond at all, I entered dispute resolution with eBay. Now the resolution has been placed on hold, and states that I've recieved an email from eBay asking for "additional documentation." I've recieved no such email. Do I need to be worried?

<TEXT> The Permanent Court of Arbitration will rule tomorrow on a case brought by the Phillipenes against China's aggressive claims in the South China Sea. It is [broadly expected](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/south-china-sea-philippines-1.3670851) that the PCA will rule against China, and that China will ignore the decision. 

What happens next? China was involved in the developing the Law of the Sea, and was among the first to sign and ratify it. Nontheless, it appears that they are blatantly violating the law, and are playing this down in [propaganda around the world,](http://time.com/4400671/philippines-south-china-sea-arbitration-case/) and are quite rudely calling out the United States. How will the US or the other South China Sea nations respond?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A Physicist, a Chemist, a Biologist, and a Mathematician are sitting in a park, people-watching, when they see two women enter the washroom facilities. A few seconds later, three women walk out, and and the chemist is shocked! The physicist tries to calm him down: "It's OK, you just haven't accounted for measurement uncertainty: we observed 2 +/- 1 people walk in, then observed 3 +/-1 walk out. Don't worry, it's all consistent!

The biologist quickly hushes her: "Nonsense! Our population is simply reproducing!" 

The mathematician just stares at the building until another man walks in. He stands up: "Ah! Now it's empty!"  </TEXT>
