<TEXT> It is hard to believe that adam sandler is a classically trained actor from tisch school of the arts. A lot of big stars came from there. He shows his range in punch drunk love, spanglish and reign over me. How cute was emily watson in it? He is a goofball but i love him. I have seen pretty much all of his movies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had no idea what the movie was about when i first watched it. I am just a big fan of adam sandler and he makes very funny movies. They might be crap but they crack me up. He just went full on bananas in it. He should do more movies with andy samberg. Vanilla ice was a good addition to the movie. It was crude, offensive and funny. Can't believe they got away with the teacher and student relationship and other stuff. Susan sarandon and her daughter were awesome. Milo was pretty funny in it. Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. In a world where people get offended by everything little thing, white chicks was a refreshing release. The wayan brothers got away with so much. I really hope they make a sequel. Terry crews was at his comedic best. The scene where he is singing vanessa carlton's a thousand miles is gold. There are so many memorable moments and funny lines. It was released over ten years ago but it still holds up today. Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is one of my fave movies. It has it all and it is an interesting movie. An erotic thriller with a difference. Denise richards' hasn't done anything decent since wild things. She was great in it with neve campbell and matt dillon. The story kept me on the edge of my seat because i didn't know what was going to happen next. There were so many twists and turns. Any movies like it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was a terrifying movie with an eerie back drop. Kelly reilly is a hot actress along with the handsome michael fassbender. I like these type of survival movies. Jack o'connell is an amazing actor. He has that explosive anger that is just crazy. Makes him scary as hell. I saw it in skins. He doesn't hold back. He is going places. Makes you really think about the kids these days, causing havoc and getting into trouble. Makes me sad to see kids go off the rails. Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ryan gosling was amazing in it even though he looked like a justin bieber boy band reject wannabe. Bradley cooper and eva mendes were great too. Gosling and mendes had chemistry. I like when ryan gosling and bradley cooper do these dark roles. It really shows their depth. She is just so stunning. Natural beauty! Mahershala ali was a nice addition too. Ben mendelsohn was a standout too. He is just a master of his craft. I thought the movie was about drug dealers and a cat and mouse style movie. I was pleasantly surprised that it had a weird structure. It is not like anything i have seen before. It is an emotional rollercoaster. It is about family and consequences. Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought the movie was about a womaniser but it was deeper than that. It was my first michael fassbender movie and it was mind blowing. I became a fan after that. He is one of the best actors at the moment. He always does interesting movies. Carey mulligan was great in it too. Sex addiction really messes up your life and relationships. I didn't really understand sex addiction until i watched that movie. It really destroys your like. Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

<TITLE> A Dangerous Method is a fascinating movie about the complex relationship between Siegmund Freud, Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein. [NSFW] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-30 15:10:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I thought the whole movie was about a love triangle and weird sexual experiments involving keira knightley. It wasn't what I expected but it was an interesting movie. You learn a lot from it. I didn't know much about freud and jung before watching it. I think keira knightley was so amazing in this movie. Her spasms, movements, accent and everything was on point. She is really the queen of period pieces. Can't believe she didn't get any awards for it. Viggo mortensen and michael fassbender were amazing too. Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't know what to expect when i first watched it. I just watched it for my faves cate blanchett and rooney mara. They were unlucky not to win oscars. The movie deserved to win an oscar at least. They did not disappoint. It was beautifully made. The costuming, cinematography and everything was dazzling. I really like lesbian love stories because women are so beautiful and it plucks at my heartstrings. I can't really explain it. I am a sucker for these type of movies. The forbidden love and love conquers all type movies. Anything else like it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry i wasn't thinking when i wrote the title. It is the curious case of benjamin button. My bad. Brain fart! When I first watched it, i was blown away by the cinematography, special effects and everything. This movie gets me every time. It is a powerful and beautiful movie. It is a hard movie to explain to people. I think it is an epic movie about love, loss and the hardships of Benjamin. Cate blanchett is so beautiful and she has that old hollywood look. Brad pitt and cate blanchett are a match made in heaven. David fincher is one of the best. I always enjoy his movies. He really puts his heart and soul in his projects. Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know it got crap reviews and people said it wasn't funny but I thought it was pretty funny. Basic plot but you can't go wrong with gal gadot and isla fisher in lingerie. Predictable and straight forward but loads of fun. It was good to see patton oswalt in a movie too after everything he has been through. It had some fun moments. You can tell gal was a for israeli soldier, she is strong and can hold her own. She is just so stunning. Jon hamm was pretty good in it. I want to see him in more movies. Makes me want to try snake wine and eat snake. Zach Galifianakis was funny as usual. Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every time I watch it, it cracks me up. This was carell's break through role i think. I know he was in the daily show and was in bruce almighty a bit but this is just tops. Steve carell is a comic genius. Amazing cast: steve carell, seth rogen, paul rudd, romany malco, jane lynch and elizabeth banks. Credit to judd apatow who makes funny and heartwarming movies. It is a feel good movie about an awkward subject. It is about to become my reality except for the collectibles, a full time job and a house. One of the funniest movies i've ever seen. It is relatable. I watched it in the cinema and everyone was laughing hard throughout the movie. Very quotable and lovable! Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never heard the story of desmond doss before this movie came out. Such a powerful and inspirational movie. It was bloody, brutal but also a beautiful movie. He was the first conscientious objector and he stuck by his morals. Mel gibson really knows how to make thought provoking and meaningful masterpieces. Andrew garfield gave the character strength and a sense of vulnerability. It had an amazing nearly all aussie cast. Hugo weaving is just so intimidating in all his roles. One of the best! Sam worthington was good too. I just love teresa palmer. I get lost in her beautiful blue eyes and she is just unbelievably stunning. The cinematography, sound editing and everything were top notch. You are immersed in the intensity of the movie. It was so realistic. Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I first saw it on tv and i had no idea what it was about. I saw johnny depp in it so i stayed and watched it all. What an emotional rollercoaster. I know it is hard to feel sorry for a drug lord but i felt a little bad for him. The movie had a great cast and a great story. It is based on george jung's life as a cocaine dealer. Penelope cruz was nominated for a razzie for her performance but i thought she played the role well. Johnny depp was at his best. Ironically the director-ted demme died of a heart attack from cocaine use. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought it would be a scary horror movie but it wasn't. Guillarmo del toro built a visually amazing atmosphere and the costumes were spectacular. The movie wasn't scary but it was interesting and it really set the mood. Killer cast too: jessica chastain, mia wasikowsi, tom hiddleston and so on. All the twists and turns kept me interested. Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never watched the original but the remake was quite disturbing. It was gory, violent and brutal. The rape scene was hard to watch. Sara paxton* was great in the movie. I accidentally said sara foster who is also hot. Sleep deprivation. She has that innocence about her and was perfect for the role. I have a crush on her and monica potter. So beautiful. Garrett dillahunt was menacing as usual. He always freaks me out. Aaron paul was nuts. Kill or be killed. A different kind of revenge movie.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a fan of tom cruise but it was so good. It was realistic and the shooting scenes were amazing. I usually don't like movies that take place in one day but collateral is one of the exceptions. Michael mann is a genius when it comes to shoot outs and action. Heat remains his best movie in my opinion but collateral is up there. Tom cruise was clinical, relentless and determined. Jamie foxx was also great as the taxi driver. I try to run like tom cruise.

Probably one of the scariest guys i've ever seen in a movie. He plays the most depraved and evil characters. </TEXT>

Tilda swinton deserved an oscar for that performance i think. She kills it everytime. Ezra miller was really creepy and messed up in it. John c riley was unexpectedly really good.

They really haven't made a name for themselves and are known for one role back in the nineties. She is attractive and could play anything from a lawyer to an Israeli soldier.

<TEXT> I know there are a lot of contenders but i think he tops them all. Kevin bacon is close. His body of work is amazing. I've been a fan of him since i watched a history of violence. He has such depth and can really scare you too. Total man crush on him too. His best movie in my opinion is eastern promises. He stepped it up. He made me cry in the road. That was intense. Gi jane was pretty decent too. I am not a fan of the lord of the rings but he is one of my fave actors. I haven't watched a few of his movies yet. I'm planning to watch his whole filmography. I hope he wins an oscar one day. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't care what anyone says, the descent is one of my fave movies. The descent 2 was a let down but still enjoyable. I thought there were some lesbian vibes between some of the characters but nothing happened. It was all our fears in one: darkness, tight spaces and heights. The ladies were interesting and had to do the unthinkable to survive. The monsters were terrifying. It is the only movie that really scared me. I don't get scared easily. No more cave exploring for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was surprised it was directed by fashion designer tom ford. I thought it was another tom ford. I didn't know much about the movie when I watched it so I was pleasantly surprised. It was intense and my brain was working over time, dissecting the whole movie. It has layers and the acting was top notch. Michael shannon had an intimidating presence. Aaron johnson was scary and good in it. Can't get past how great jake gyllenhaal is. He never lets me down. He has to be in the running for an oscar soon. Amy adams was quite breathtakingly beautiful in the movie. Complex movie! </TEXT>

<TEXT> An amazing directional debut by joel edgerton. He also wrote it and produced it. I thought it would be some violent revenge movie but i was blown away by the intensity of it. I felt some charles manson vibes while watching it. It had a hitchcock feel about it. Joel edgerton looked menacing, creepy and unsettling. He is very underrated. Jason bateman and rebecca hall were also great. The absence of a soundtrack made it more eerie and really set the tone of the movie. </TEXT>

It might be too late for him to get more offers. He has only directed a few movies. One of which is the classic romper stomper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mara wilson was a great child actress but she hasn't acted in a long time. I know she gave it up for writing and stuff but I want to see her back. I wouldn't mind seeing macaulay culkin, danica mckellar, tiffani thiessen, amy jo johnson and a few others again. I think a lot of child actors never make it big after they grow up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She dominated the seventies and eighties with her blaxploitation movies. She was pretty much the only black actress in those times and she was the leading lady. You have to admire her strength and conviction. She also never ages. She looks the same now. I haven't seen all her movies but i really like the prison themed ones. They were funny and had lots of action. Surprised she never became a big star in hollywood. She will always be remembered for her iconic roles and changing the face of black cinema. </TEXT>

I knew it had lots of bad reviews but i thought it was a decent raunchy comedy. Boy was i wrong. </TEXT>
