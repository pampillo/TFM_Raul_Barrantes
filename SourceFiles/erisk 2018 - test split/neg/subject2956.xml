<TEXT> Mudskippers can stay out off water for a long time, as long as they stay moist. I have no clue if these are mudskippers. I am no expert. Catfish are also known to walk around to find new water sources. Mudskippers are generally considered to be the most adapted to stay out of water. I assumed they can walk longer distances too because they can stay out longer. I dont have a number for the distance </TEXT>

<TEXT> Googled about this ad just now. The first link says this is from a [parody of 90s ads in Malaysia](http://www.worldofbuzz.com/malaysian-ad-showing-woman-hijab-gets-ridiculed-heres-truth/)

The second link that came up was [this](http://mma.mymsa.org/?p=2291)

Sunsilk Clean Fresh variant was formulated specifically for Hijab wearing young Malaysian women. But due to cultural sensitivities we couldnt show hijab wearing women washing hair (usage) or flaunting hairstyles (proposition) in communication. This puts forth a unique challenge for Sunsilk  to advertise a shampoo without showing hair

So they still have shampoo ads that don't show hair

Edit: This seems to be the kind of shampoo ad they are parodying - [Sunsilk ad (from 2006?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=excxIZ4wUvg) </TEXT>

I didn't think it did when I made it. Video source must be posted when possible because of this, so whoever wants to see the rest of the video can. It also credits the original poster. </TEXT>

Edit: [Seems to be from an older video](http://www.thisisinsider.com/synchronized-swimmers-walking-in-pool-2016-8). Apologies if it is a repost. Please leave a message if it is, I'll delete.

Edit2: If you click the rotate button on the gif twice you can see it the right way up. Funny thing is that you notice they are not moving forward at all. In the upside down version it looked like(atleast to me) they were walking forward. Guess assumptions are 50 percent(or higher) of our reality.

<TEXT> Oldest of Hindu/Indian traditions. Even in TN it is practiced by a minority. Probably goes way back to the first Homo Sapiens who migrated into India 50-70 thousand years back. Don't be influenced by what migrants from the priestly classes from the near middle east who came much later say, who claim they define Hinduism. Historically their influence starts in the North around the Gupta period(4th Century) and much later in the South. I have very little of the genes from these earliest Indians(like most South Indians), but I hold these traditions in great respect.

Incidentally, do you know boomerangs as are as much Indian as Aboriginal Australian?

<TEXT>  English/Hindi/Mother tongue signage

That is what I want too. I would be against a no English rule. If the news report is true and they want signs only in Hindi/Tamil and no English, I would be against it. Seriously, would you like to see all English signs removed in your city or state? What are they trying to achieve with that? Hindi speakers need learn no other language but non-hindi speakers would have to learn 2 extra languages, hindi for the nation and english for the world? People coming up with these rules are no different from the Tamil fanatics mentioned in the article. They are not nationalists, just hindi fanatics. That sort of no English rule would be as stupid as a no Hindi rule. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only a few Tamils oppose learning Hindi when *I* suggest that it would be a good idea. But if *a Hindi speaker* suggests that they learn Hindi, they and me would be up in arms. This is why there is an impression we hate Hindi. No Englishman is telling Tamils to learn English because the world needs a link language, so nobody has an issue.

Nobody forced me to learn Hindi in school, I chose it as my 3rd language myself. So did half my class. If the government had made it compulsory, then I would have had issues. It is best for the Central government to completely stay away from language issues in TN and they mostly have in the past few years. It is only small TN parties that bring it up hoping they get some news coverage. These parties dont have a single seat in the assembly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If like you every Hindi speaker accepts that Hindi is just another Indian language like many other languages, then there would be no opposition to Hindi at all. Unfortunately that is not the case, though things are changing.

I would not choose English over Tamil or Assamese were it offered to me in school.

Lets be practical, English is here to stay. It is the world's, the internet's, Wikipedia's and Reddit's primary language. It is also the default technical and scientific language. It should be everybody's second language for practical reasons. If Hindi is your 1st language then you can learn another Indian language after English. If Hindi isn't your 1st language then learn it as your third language. People everywhere in the world are going to choose English as the second language.

English is overrated by the Lutyens elite and ofcourse Dravidian politics.

None of the top Dravidian politicians except J could speak English fluently. English was only used as a tool to show their opposition to Hindi.

Anti-Hindi sentiments are so irrelevant in Tamil politics nowadays that the main parties rarely use it. Only the fringe elements mentioned in the article do. Everybody knows it is impossible for the Central government to impose anything without the people's approval.

Your Hindi hate is so much ...

No, I can speak the language and use it regularly. That doesn't mean I suck anybody's dick. You are the one saying you suck dick if you speak another language. Hope you learn Tamil soon and I can accuse you of sucking Dravidian dick \_()_/ . Seriously, you might be too old to learn a new language but atleast learn about and experience different cultures in the country. There are almost as many here as the rest of the world put together. </TEXT>

Since you are commenting in English and I am sure you use a lot of English in your life, are you sucking the dick of your ex-colonial masters too? Since your implying that your Mughlai/Persian/Arabic influenced language is more important than Tamil or Telugu or Marathi, can I assume you like sucking circumcised dicks too? </TEXT>

Having a thin skin is just a sign of weakness and insecurity which I mostly identify only with liberals. </TEXT>

It was reported that these groups burnt an Indian flag there during the Jallikattu protests, which caused the main organisers in Chennai to call it off. Coimbatore is the only place in TN where Muslims are openly fundamentalist. The Muslims in the rest of TN rarely are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They say theres no honour among thieves and that proved all too true for one hapless member of a gang who robbed a Cape Town jewellery store. Three of the men made it to their getaway car at Gatesville shopping centre in Athlone.

But when a running accomplice failed to catch up with the moving car they sped off without him.

Footage from a CCTV camera shows the man flinging jewels worth R50,000 to the ground before being pounced on by two law enforcement officers.

<TEXT>  ASHWAUBENON, Wis. (WBAY) - A driver crashed into Plato's Closet store in Ashwaubenon Friday morning.

Ashwaubenon Public Safety says the driver, a 78-year-old De Pere woman, got her foot got stuck between the gas and brake. That caused the vehicle to accelerate into the building.

Police say a 24-year-old customer was taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

The owner of the store said the customer who was hurt had a son with her. He was very close to where the car crashed into the shop. The owner says the little boy was "very fortunate" and is okay.

<TEXT> It's quite common for elephants to enter villages and towns looking for food or water. In India people would rarely hurt them, only try to scare them away. So they keep coming back. Elephants are rarely aggressive like this one, they usually are happy with a trumpeting charge for a few feet to warn you, and then withdraw. Think this one is in musth(a testesterone driven state of aggression). Elephants are assholes when they are in musth. </TEXT>

If an elephant spreads its ears and holds it stiff, then it's trying to intimidate you. If it's more than 10 metres away(and is not in musth) it is better to hold your ground and shit your pants. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are right. Never said they are. Also true of muslims and xtians. But if you run into a anti-hindu, anti-modi tamil nationalist, there is a very high chance that they are from one of these groups.

I also wouldn't call these people Ambedkarites because Ambedkar was definitely a nationalist and a patriot. He was also a very intelligent, very classy man. These people are none of those things. Periyar's rationalism had a lot of good points. His anti-Brahminism was also probably justified for his time. But these people are only driven by their hatred which in turn is fueled by their insecurities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes you are right. But they have not exploited the issue like the other parties have. Considering there role as supporters of Indian culture/traditions they should have been the most vocal. Let me make this clear, unless they are as vocal about Tamil issues as they are about Hindu issues in the North, they are not going to get full support here. They should realise, for Tamils, Pongal and the traditions associated with it are as important as Diwali/Holi in the North. If they want a national footprint, they should first start supporting all Indian/Hindu traditions equally and vocally. Not just the ones followed in the North. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a BJP/Modi supporter and dont give a fuck about what the DMK/Congress did. What has happened is that the BJP has missed a huge opportunity to exploit an emotional issue, just like they did with the Ram Mandir issue. They are in the same position here that they were during the 1980s at the national level. They are not big here and they should have hit the streets as a guardian of Tamil culture. That is how you win an election in TN.

BJP has to start thinking locally in TN, and not just depend on Modi and national issues to win an election here. And the best way to do it is to stand up for Tamil issues. If they don't, people are never going to abandon the Dravidian parties. Their vote share is higher than the Tamil nationalist fringe groups. If even those monkeys could organise themselves so well, why couldn't the BJP/RSS? </TEXT>

<TEXT> First the BJP and the RW missed a golden opportunity by not taking an active part in the agitation. Now these idiots want to discredit the whole agitation as a Christian conspiracy. The agitation is much bigger than the crowd at Marina. Even the crowd there is a mixed one. Fringe groups have been trying to take control of the protests there, but they do it for every tamil centric emotional issue. It should have been the BJP and the RSS which should have been there first to protest against a ban on a Tamil-Hindu-Indian cultural event. Do they standup only for north indian culture? If so TN is better of with the Dravidian parties.

And it is time we stop giving importance to these tamil nationalist, evangelist, maoist groups. They have rarely won even a panchayat election in TN. As for as the LTTE is concerned, there was a lot of sympathy for Srilankan Tamils, but not for the LTTE after the Rajiv Gandhi assassination. Have you ever heard of a single Indian Tamil fighting along side the LTTE in the past many years?

The article is silly on so many levels. Probably written by some pseudo-Tamil like Subramanian Swamy sitting in Delhi. If students from Stephens take part in an agitation in Delhi does that mean it is sponsored by the Church? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There has always been an anti-national, left-leaning, anti-hindu fringe in TN, like in any other part of the country. But their numbers and influence has always been blown out of proportion because they use tamil cultural identity as a tool to get into mainstream movements. Whenever there is a distinctly tamil issue, they would be the first people to speak out, creating the impression that the whole of TN is behind their anti-national agenda. Tamils in general are overly chauvinistic but they are rarely anti-national. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would be totally against any ban on any of *our* cultural symbols or practices. This includes gau mutra or animal sacrifice in Garhwal or dog eating in the NE, because I consider them to be part of *my* culture. What bugs me is that you don't consider jallikattu to be part of your culture.

I strongly believe in a pan-Indian nationalism based on our shared cultural identity, and have considered people like you and others on this sub as part of it. Am I a chutiya for considering your culture as mine, when you don't consider mine as yours? You should have been the first person to take your trishul out when the ban was announced. You should be as pissed off as you would be if somebody says something against karwa-chauth or Deepavali crackers or Holi.

A lot of protesters on Marina are like the IAC protesters in Delhi who later became AAPtards, and similarly anti-national and left leaning. But the pro-jallikattu movement has much wider support just like the anti-corruption movement did. Don't judge the motives of the movement by the activists and movie stars who like to appear in front of tv cameras. And I hope you are not lurking on randia where the same kind of Tamils hangout.

I am not going to argue about the rights and wrongs of jallikattu. I don't have to. I would just consider it a betrayal if you and other non-tamil RW people don't support it.

The most surprising thing is the talk in TN that BJP could inherit the traditional ADMK voter base in the future. They need a charismatic, strong leader here for that. Just Modi's goodwill wouldn't do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jallikattu was not known in TN outside rural areas before the ban. Personally, I knew almost nothing about it. Now I'm willing to pay to see one.

If the ban is lifted, it is going to become a mass sport with big crowds, commercial sponsorship and live TV coverage. Till then, with people considering this ban an insult to Tamil culture it is just going to grow bigger and bigger as an underground sport.

Thank you SC, PETA for making it so popular. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It might look like he is praising Modi. But the tone of the article suggests Patel is worried demonetisation is going well for Modi, and he is desperately hoping that something goes wrong. He is trying to paint demonetisation as a failure and that it is being held up only by the respect people have for Modi. He is saying one good thing about Modi to trash him on the more important thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no chance of these cucks winning a single election after this. And Modi wouldn't let them loot till then, hopefully.
Hope somebody splits this party soon and puts TN out of its misery. 

One surprising thing is that the governance under OPS has been pretty good. The cyclone aftermath especially was handled well, but I don't expect it to last long. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Indus Valley proto-Shiva and the dancing girl are not new discoveries. Any religion that was followed in the Indus Valley is the oldest form of Hinduism. The Vedas are not the roots of Hinduism, just an important part of the evolution of Hinduisms many ideas. It doesn't matter if the Vedas originated in India or that there was an Aryan migration. The fact is that there was Hinduism before that, and Hinduism has continued to evolve after that.

Vedic Hinduism which was probably promoted by a powerful, ambitious priesthood, had always tried to appropriate gods from other strands of hinduism to bring in more followers. Other gods were made avatars(Ram, Krishna) or relatives(Ganesh, Murugan) of vedic gods. The vedic Shiva himself is probably a evolution of other gods like the Indus Shiva and Rudra.

<TEXT> Let's say I'm a below average guy with low self esteem. What sort of partner would I possibly expect to get? I would expect to get a below average looker.

Wouldn't it be better for me if my plain-looking wife covered herself, so nobody knows that I could only get an average looker? But then, wouldn't everybody think my wife is not good looking because she covers herself?

The solution is to make sure that every woman covers herself, including the good looking ones.

So **MODESTY. Because GOD said so**

If you are a normal guy, you already are thinking "but why should looks matter at all?" It doesn't, but for a guy with low self-esteem, anything that he doesn't have and can't get matters a whole lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was commenting on the other comnents here, not your post itself.

Burial is not a prerequisite for a memorial, but children, saints and people who die at a very old age are sometimes buried in hinduism. My great-great grandfather was a philanthropist and a freedom fighter and he was buried and a memorial was built there.

Cremation is a custom, not an absolute rule in hinduism. In ancient times people were always buried in the south, usually in large pots. Archaeologists have excavated a large number of these sites, both in the south and at Indus Valley sites. Cremation became more common only after Vedic practices became more common, after rulers here brought in brahmins to run their temples. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also boycott newspapers and magazines which are printed on paper, since paper is made from trees.

 Each Year More than 20 million trees are consumed for production of book papers and about 95 million tress are consumed for newsprint.

 Deforestation is the source of 25% of human caused greenhouse gas emissions.

 Over 40% of the global industrial wood harvest is used to make paper.

 Forests that have been cleared and allowed to regrow do not store as much carbon as an undisturbed forest. In one study in Ohio, a forest that was cleared and allowed to regrow for 70 years stored only half as much carbon as a nearby forest that had never been disturbed.

 The pulp and paper industry is the 4th largest emitter of greenhouse gases among U.S. manufacturing industries.The paper industry contributes 9% of total carbon dioxide emissions from manufacturing.

 Paper makes up 26% of landfills. Degradation produces methane a greenhouse gas with 23 times the heat trapping capacity of carbon dioxide. Landfills are the source of 34% of methane releasesthe single largest source in the U.S.

<TEXT> Surprised how well informed Goyal is, even of a clown like Krugman. Krugman is a known Clinton ass-licker who highly praised Bill Clinton's bills which made it very easy for poorer people with low credit ratings to get housing loans in the 90s. These housing reforms led to the subprime crisis. When the crisis actually hit, he became a big critic of Bush without mentioning once Clinton's role in it and his praise for it.

He was a big critic of Obama during the 2008 primaries because he was expecting to get a role in the US government if Clinton won. Hence his opposition to Obama, nothing to do with economics.

And the day Trump won and Hillary lost, he wrote in the NY Times that US had become a failed state! </TEXT>

Madrid29 NOV 2016 - 10:58CET

 A woman was rescued from the roof of her car on Monday after the vehicle came close to being fully submerged in a flooded underpass in the Spanish city of Sagunto, in the Mediterranean province of Valencia.

 The motorist had attempted to drive through even though access to the underpass had reportedly been fenced off because of high water levels.

 The driver allegedly ignored warning signs near the underpass

 As the car quickly began to sink, the driver was able to get out through the passenger seat window. She then climbed on the roof with her belongings to wait for help to arrive.

 A television crew captured her plight, and images of a woman standing atop a gently floating red hatchback quickly spread on social media.

 It was journalists who first alerted the local emergency services. Half an hour later, the stranded motorist was taken to safety on a firefighters shoulders. </TEXT>

After all we are talking about the same people who deny the surgical strikes, deny that any Pak soldiers were killed during the Kargil War, denied the very existence of Bangladesh till 1975 and claim they won the 65 war. The Pak Army rarely wins any confrontation, even the ones with their own terrorists, but amusingly claim they lost nothing after every confrontation.

The Pak Army is a joke, but what is more unbelievable is how stupid the Pakistani people are in trusting them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Indias shortage of banknotes spurs protests**

*A cruel cash crunch emboldens the opposition*

Nov 17th 2016|Asia

WHEN Narendra Modi, Indias prime minister, announced the shock recall of high-denomination banknotes on November 8th, economists hailed the move as strong but necessary medicine. The overnight scrapping of some $200bn-worth of cash would flush out forged rupees and corrupt earnings, dragging Indias vast underground economy into the bright modern world of electronic payments, bank accounts and taxes. Political pundits called it a masterstroke. Not only would citizens queuing to exchange old notes for new see for themselves how Mr Modi had kept a campaign promise to smoke out bad guys. With crucial state elections looming, the sting would also render worthless the vote-buying war chests of his political rivals.

The practice, however, has not lived up to the theory. The surprise scrapping of what amounted to 86% of the cash in circulation could, in fact, turn out to be the worst mistake of Mr Modis career. For hundreds of millions of Indians who cannot pay for essential goods with credit or debit cards, it has brought not satisfaction but the misery of waiting in angry queues outside overwhelmed banks, only to get limited quantities of new bills, or to find they have run out. For many among the estimated 80% of wage earners who are paid in cash, for the tens of thousands of villages with no banking facilities, and for the traders, drivers, farmers, prostitutes, beggars and others who work in the informal economy that accounts for anywhere between 25% and 70% of Indias GDP, it has brought anxiety and hardship. Well know later if Modi is right or wrong, a man outside a bank in Delhi told one television crew. All I know now is Im starving.

Rather than being cowed by the currency move, Indias hitherto divided and disparate opposition has been invigorated. At the stormy opening of the winter session of parliament on November 16th, Sitaram Yechury, a communist MP, ridiculed the prime minister as Modi Antoinette, echoing postings on social media that portray a regal Mr Modi above the caption, Let them use plastic. Leftist, rightist and regional party leaders later marched to demand that the currency change be abandoned. Even Indias supreme court chimed in. At a hearing over legal challenges to Mr Modis move, one judge joked that the governments claim of a surgical strike against black money looked more like carpet-bombing.

Mr Modi is unlikely to relent. Many citizens remain convinced that their hardship is in a good cause. Economists concur that in the longer term the currency swap will bring benefits, albeit not the ones that the government has touted loudest. According to a study by an academy attached to Indias finance ministry, cash makes up a negligible portion of illicit holdings: property, tradable goods and foreign bank accounts amount to much more. In any case the biggest hoarders of cash are probably the best-equipped to get rid of it. Within a day of Mr Modis announcement, first-class tickets on Indias longest train route, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, were sold out for the next four months: they could still be bought with old money, then later refunded for new.

The people really caught out are likely to be ordinary citizens who failed to bank recent transactions such as property sales, which are commonly made in cash, or who were saving for some costly cash outlay. It does not help that this is Indias peak season for weddings, or that much of the country is seeing the end of harvest and beginning of new planting. Farmers have found themselves stranded, often far from banking facilities, with old money that they cannot spend on seeds and fertilisers. Wholesalers cannot pay suppliers and merchants cannot pay wholesalers. Informal financial networks, which by one estimate lend around 40% as much as banks do, are frozen.

Economists reckon that the currency squeeze will knock 0.5-1 percentage points off Indias growth rate in each of the next two quarters. When the money supply stabilises, important benefits should be felt. Indian banks, for one thing, will have received a huge injection of new deposits as clients rush to unload old bills before the deadline of 30th December but can only withdraw restricted volumes of new ones. Fresh deposits in the first week amounted to nearly $57bn, equal to almost half the increase in bank deposits over the whole preceding year. The boost to balance-sheets, particularly for state-owned banks burdened in recent years by non-performing loans, should lower interest rates and spur new lending.

The cash crunch has been an undreamed-of boon for the electronic-payments industry. Mobikwik, a mobile-wallet system, reports an 18-fold increase in use. Paytm, a rival, took out full front-page page advertisements featuring pictures of Mr Modi, congratulating him on The boldest decision in the financial history of independent India! Indias taxmen will also profit hugely from their enhanced power of scrutiny. That is a good thing in a country where only 1% of citizens pay income tax, and where government revenues amount to a puny 20% of GDP.

In the meantime, the difficulties of Mr Modis experiment are a lesson in humility. Despite much progress India remains poor, patchily administered and reliant on shaky infrastructure. On paper, for instance, its 1.3bn people wield a respectable-sounding 723m credit and debit cards, and under a government scheme some 255m bank accounts have been opened. But a closer look reveals that most of those cards and accounts are scarcely used, and only for small amounts.

Mr Modis shock therapy took the banking system by surprise. There were not enough new bills, in the wrong denominations, and Indias 220,000 cash machines were anyway not calibrated to handle them. Even now fewer than one in ten has been modified to do so and it will take weeks to adjust them all. In the meantime Indians will have to do something they are all too used to doing: wait. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Competition for what? We shouldn't be taking this sub thing too seriously. Should this sub be like randia which bans any mention of /r/indianews? I don't think the mods and users here are insecure as the mods in randia are.

There are thousands of subs on Reddit and subscribing to two more subs makes no difference, even though they have the same type of posts. For example, /r/interestingasfuck and /r/woahdude have the same kind of posts. Most people are  subscribed to both subs, and somebody posting to one sub would also xpost to the other sub. Competition and choice is a good thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't know much about him. But I remember he was one of the people who opposed the release of Kamal Haasan's movie that dealt with Islamic terror. He was supporting some Islamic/Jihadi TN group then. He hides behind the cloak of Tamil pride in attacking India to mask his religious beliefs. He was supposed to have been a successful director in the past, but hasn't made any movies recently. He and his kind get far more attention than they deserve by making shocking statements.

The so called Tamil nationalists are not like Khalistanis or Kashmiri separatists. They are more like AAPturds. They hate the country and hinduism for the same reasons AAPturds do. This is exploited by Jihadis and other anti-national elements just like they exploit AAP. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Nehru's special security officer K.F. Rustamji gives us some insight into his personality </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-14 04:18:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Rustamji notes that Nehru was vain about his looks. He wore his Gandhi cap at a rakish angle and was never seen without it. He was bald as an egg. I noted that he insisted that every photograph taken by our photographers be shown to him before being released to the press. If one had caught him yawning, asleep or picking his nose, he tore it up with his own hands.

Rustamji has a lot to say about Nehrus unpredictable temper. If his breakfast was late, he stormed into the kitchen or the servants quarters to berate his cook. Once, on a visit to Sira (in Mysore), "he barged into the kitchen in a temper, like Jesus among the moneychangers, and almost chased out all the cooks from there," Rustamji notes in his journal. At almost every public meeting, he found something wrong about the police bandobast to control the crowds lining his route and the distance at which milling crowds surrounded the platform. And let everyone have it. Even before he became prime minister, he slapped the president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee in full view of the crowd because the microphone went dead while he was speaking. Lashing out at unruly mobs became a habit. During a visit of the prime minister of Pakistan, Mohammed Ali, in 1953, Nehru was furious at the inadequate arrangements for containing the crowds: "JN got angrier and angrier. He flung aboutpushing people, running after cameramen, shouting, firing. I had never seen him so angry. Somebody opened the door of a car for him; he banged the door and beat people with a large, dishevelled bouquet," Rustamji noted. However, his vocabulary of abuse was limited and the worst he could yell wasbadtameezorbewakoof. I was at the receiving end on two occasions. Once he arrived in London past midnight. I asked him if he would like me to accompany him to his hotel. "Dont be silly; go home and sleep," he ordered. Instead of going to his hotel, he drove to Lady Mountbattens residence. The next morning one of the papers had his photograph with Lady Mountbatten in her negligee opening the door for him. He was furious. On another occasion he took Lady M out for a quiet dinner to a Greek restaurant. The proprietor recognised them and informed the press. Their photographs were in many papers. I was summoned to his presence. He gave me a withering look and said: "You have a strange notion of publicity." I thought it best not to say anything in my defence.

Like most Indians, Nehru treated whites with more courtesy than his countrymen: he spoke on the level to whites but tended to talk down to Indians. At times he could forget his manners. Once I had to host a lunch for the editors of leading British newspapers to meet him. Halfway through the meal he fell silent. When a couple of questions were put to him, he simply looked up at the ceiling and did not reply. The questions froze in the air. As if to lend the air some warmth, he lit a cigarette while others were still eating. To add to my discomfiture, Krishna Menon fell asleep. It was a disastrous attempt at public relations.

Rustamji noted that his idol was a tireless talker. He started talking to men and women in the car taking him to the venue of his meeting. His rambling speeches would at times go on and on for over an hour while many in his audience dozed. In England his audiences were limited. I noted that even during musical performances Nehru, sitting in the middle of the front row, kept talking to men and women sitting beside him. However, he did not indulge in gossip and small talk. When he met U Nu, prime minister of Burma, his host tried to show off how interested he was in India. "Panditji, I like your Vyjanthimala very much," he said. Panditji turned to his shadow and asked in Hindustani, "Kaun hai yeh Vyjanthimala?" U Nu also advised Nehru not to lose his temper at the conference. "I will try my best," Nehru replied. "But if I do, U Nu, you must kick me hard under the table."

While for the most part Rustamji bends over backwards to make allowances for his idol, he confesses that Nehru had his share of "littleness": "It would be difficult for a person who has not known JN from close to imagine what a petty, cantankerous man he could be at times. How rude and arrogant and full of prima donna tantrumshow irascible and selfish in small things! How childish and unbearably inconsiderate he was, not only to me but to those who were supposed to be his trusted advisers! And more than anything else, how impossibly sure he could be of himself and his dictums..."

If anybody posts NDTV links here for the next week, just downvote it. And never watch that channel on your TV. If there is a way to unsubscribe from their channels on DTH or cable, do that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rest of India probably emits as much pollutants as the North. But coastal areas like Chennai or Mumbai don't suffer as much because of the sea breeze. Also colder temperatures make a big difference, pollutants like automobile exhausts tend to stay much longer at the ground level.

I have suffered from allergy issues leading to respiratory issues all my life. I have lived in Chennai, Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai. I have had very few issues staying in Chennai and Mumbai compared to Delhi and Bangalore. It also makes a big difference where I stay in Chennai, the closer to the sea the better. </TEXT>

Hope everybody on this sub has a great Deepavali, since I recognize most of the regulars here cos I have been on Reddit right from the beginning(with a different account), when I was in school and Reddit didn't even have subs.

<TEXT> This article is so full off Maoist bullshit, I thought I was reading The Hindu for a second. There are some disadvantages to banning Chinese imports, like cheaper industrial machinery, telecom equipment, solar panels, etc. But most of this cheaper prices is due to overproduction fueled by over investment there. These cheaper prices are not going to last forever, maybe 2-3 years max.

The bulk of the imports like cheap phones, tvs, other electronics, toys, fireworks, etc can be manufactured at a slightly higher cost here, but would give a fillip to 'Make in India', which is very desirable in the long run. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Research suggests that north-south positions on maps have psychological consequences. In general, north is associated with richer people, more expensive real estate, and higher altitude, while south is associated with poorer people, cheaper prices, and lower altitude (the "north-south bias"). When participants were presented with south-up oriented maps, this north-south bias disappeared.

Researchers posit the observed association between map-position and goodness/badness (north=good; south=bad) is caused by (i) the convention of consistently placing north at the top of maps, and (ii) a much more general association between vertical position and goodness/badness (up=good, down=bad), which has been documented in numerous contexts (e.g., power/status, profits/prices, affect/emotion, and even the divine).

<TEXT> Centralized authentication and billing for hotspots is not a big technical issue. Third party companies can provide the service. Both the consumer and the hotspot provider needs to have an account with the same biller. TRAI regulations can definitely help. Regulations are needed to make sure upstream internet providers, cannot restrict their consumers from providing their own paid internet services downsream, even for home connections.

The bigger issue is with the limited area a single hotspot can cover. One way out would be to encourage cablewallahs to setup hotspots along their cable routes. Most cables already carry internet traffic anyway. All they would have to do is to tap into their cable and connect routers at regular intervals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right through the Cold-War one side prodded and probed the other side to see how far they'll go. I think India hasn't done enough of it over the past 20 years to gauge Pak's resolve. It's better for the media to do the probing, rather than something more official (like the government releasing the footage). It makes it easier for the Pak Army to question the source. They were probably anticipating this, hence the ban on Indian channels 

Anyways, how far are you from the border? I am far, far away  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Praveen Swami (the defence analyst who wrote this) initially trried to play down the strikes by pointing out that these sort of Indian Army attacks across the LOC have been happening regularly for the past 20 years, implying that Modi has done nothing different. Then he wanted to know if troops actually crossed the border or if the camps were precision targeted with artillery. Now he has written this. In his defence other analysts too have pointed out that there was nothing new about cross border attacks, just that the scale was much larger this time and that India was open about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doubt it. The last thing the Paki army wants is for the footage to be released. If it is, they would be forced to retaliate and put themselves in danger, instead of the apes they send over. I seriously doubt if they have the stomach for it. There is a good chance that a deal has been struck between Doval and their NSA  when they spoke to each other, about not releasing the footage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Other commentators like Praveen Swami have been saying this right from the beginning. What was special this time was the scale of the operation. Hitting six points across the LOC at the same time is almost an invasion. I am really surprised by the lack of resistance from the Paki side especially when they knew a strike was probably coming. The denial from their army just shows how scared they are, of their people knowing about this humiliation. </TEXT>

If we go by names, surnames or namesakes, Mira Nair is happy to be a Malayali Nair. If anyone mistakes me for a Kerala Nair, I am perfectly happy. I never deny that I am not from Kerala but the fact is I am a Punjabi from Amritsar, says filmmaker, director, writer Mira Nair

<TEXT> Is he really subtly pushing an agenda here? I am not too sure. 

What he seems to be doing here is trying to get a small a bit of the limelight that has been falling on Modi on this issue. He is trying to look magnanimous by praising Modi, at the same time he isn't enough of a gentleman to give Modi full credit. So he brought in the 'counter Paki propaganda' bullshit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everybody can see you are asking pointless questions which have no answers, to avoid answering questions that I asked you first. Are you a Muslim and are you gay? If you are either of these or both, I don't see the reason why you are so scared of admitting it. Is it shame? Personally I don't see any shame if you are a gay Muslim. Of course your family might think differently. In which case you can always convert to secular liberalism. </TEXT>

That would be a starting point for discussing what exactly Indian culture is, and hopefully the sub wouldn't be as anti-muslim in the future as it is right now. Neither this sub nor the rest of our society is ever going to change as long people like you don't state boldly who and what you are, and speak up for yourself. Dont expect some secular/liberal clown to speak for you here, which IMO is an insult to your own intelligence. If that is what you want, there is always /r/india. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fuck all Indian cults and their retarded followers. Fuck Asaram, Nityananda and every other cunt out there.

Even the middle-east and the west had no cults initially. Then it started with Moses(and the original katuas), then ambitious katua Jesus and then johnny-come-lately Mohammed who modeled himself after the original katuas.

Fortunately ambitious Indian babas/swamis/yogis (or assholes as I would call them) have not been so successful in getting enough retarded followers to form their own cults that can morph into new religions later on. Give Asaram (or one of his kind) enough followers, and he would have no qualms claiming he is God's son or his only messenger, and that his true followers should kill everybody who doesn't believe that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I meant which city? I am not a regular beef eater, though I have no religious issues with it. I have eaten quite a few hamburgers when I was in the US, but have eaten very little beef in India. I have tasted mallu syrian chilli beef(with the coconut), a bit of beef biriyani in Hyderabad once and I was told a biriyani I had in Pondicherry once was actually beef. I found the beef in India to be one of the vilest tasting, smelling meats I've ever had. I suspect the mallus can eat it only because they mix it with ground coconut.

As far as I know beef in India is just an extremely cheap source of protein from old and unproductive, cows and buffaloes which have reached the end of their lives. So where did you eat this heavenly beef biriyani? I want some too. </TEXT>

Gcs8 is one of the older indian redditors and is actually one of the most well informed, most interesting redditors around. Despite the hatred for him on this sub, I think he makes the sub more interesting. I cant say the same about his parrot.

<TEXT> More than a religious issue this is being done for political reasons. The BJP and its allies won 15 vote share in the last assembly elections. A surprisingly large portion of these votes came from dalits voting BJP for the first time. Dalits have traditionally voted for the Left and now the comrades are running scared. Kerala commies are some of the biggest goons in India and they are not going to yield ground easily. Hence the recent bomb blasts and killings against the BJP. Expect a lot of bloodshed in the near future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Habib is more of a jihadi than a communist. He is not alone in this. A lot of Islamic bigots have been attacking India and Hinduism claiming they are secular/liberal.

To those of you who don't know about this guy, his primary premise is that the idea of India as a single entity is a concept forged by the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughals! Essentially he is saying India was founded by Muslim invaders, just like Americans claim America was founded by European settlers! Interestingly he describes the ancient religions of India as Buddhism, Jainism and 'Brahmanism'. </TEXT>

So as a non-vegetarian   Tamil if I am allowed to eat only plants on certain days if I live in Gujarat, am I allowed to insist that everybody who lives in TN should eat only fish on certain days? Any protein starved halfwit who is going to argue on moral grounds against meat beware. I dont give a fuck about your holiness, for the same reasons I dont give a fuck about the holier than thou attitude of so called liberals. And if any deluded asshole here wants to argue that vegetarianism is the Indian/Hindu way, better get ready for a lesson in Hindu history. This is not an issue about your religion(Jain or Hindus) but about the things which you think makes you special. If you think you are special by refraining from things that gives you pleasure(meat, alcohol, ganja, sex) and not by contributing to society, I am going to assume you are no different from the 'liberals' who think they are special because they are 'morally superior', for the reason that they have no way to contribute to society because they have no useful skills. On the other hand you dont want to eat meat or pussy or cock, and consider it as a personal preference and not as some holy jihad, then you have my respect. </TEXT>

The second China embarks on some military misadventure either in South Asia or the South China Sea, these countries would have a reason to impose sanctions.

<TEXT> Amnesty International's Jihad Problem

The rights group's pro-Taliban partner is detained on terror suspicions.

Is "jihad in self-defense . . . antithetical to human rights? Our answer is no." That was how Claudio Cordone, then Amnesty International's interim secretary-general, responded in February 2010 to criticism after the human-rights group made ex-Guantanamo detainee Moazzam Begg its poster child in protest of the alleged horrors of U.S. antiterror detention policies.

That's worth recalling now that British authorities have arrested Mr. Begg on suspicions of attending terrorist training camps and facilitating terrorism in Syria. Local police in Birmingham arrested Mr. Begg on Tuesday. He hasn't been charged, but under a British antiterror statute he can be detained for up to 14 days.

Mr. Begg, a British-Pakistani citizen, was captured in Pakistan in 2002 and transferred to Guantanamo as an enemy combatant. Soon after his release in 2005, Amnesty began sharing platforms with Mr. Begg, describing his U.K.-based Cageprisoners advocacy group as a "leading human rights organization" and inviting him to deliver the 2006 Amnesty International Annual Lecture in Belfast.

Amnesty ignored that Mr. Begg had written of his admiration for the Taliban. Nor was Amnesty bothered that, alongside his "human-rights" work, Mr. Begg was conducting fawning interviews with al Qaeda propagandists such as the late terrorist imam Anwar al-Awlaki.

In 2010, Gita Sahgal, who at the time headed Amnesty's gender unit, broke ranks by making public her opposition to promoting the views of "Britain's most famous supporter of the Taliban." Amnesty responded by suspending Ms. Sahgal, and she was eventually pushed out. "I don't see Amnesty International and other human rights organizations coming to grips with the fact that their research and campaigning have been tainted" by their association with Mr. Begg, Ms. Saghal told us this week. In a statement, Amnesty told us that its "relationship with Moazzam Begg was as a victim of human-rights violations." It added that "everyone has the right to be presumed innocent until they are charged and proven guilty in a fair trial."

That's true. Then again, if the suspicions about Mr. Begg are proved in court he would join a long list of known Gitmo recidivistsincluding Said al-Shihri, a Saudi Arabian who co-founded al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Turkish terror facilitator Ibrahim Sen and dozens more who have returned to waging jihad since their release. It's a reminder of why the detention center was necessary and shouldn't be closed.

The story is also a reminder of the anti-American fervor and intellectual confusion that led Amnesty to team up with Mr. Begg. The world needs morally credible human-rights organizations. Amnesty too often isn't one of them.

<TEXT> I am a big fan of documentaries and I've seen her in a few BBC wildlife docus. She was one of the greatest Indian females of our times (I am saying that knowing fully well she was not human). Glad to see her being given importance on our sub.

[Machali - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machali_%28tigress%29)

I was trying to find a Youtube link to a BBC Natural World documentary about her, but I am on phone and 3G signal is weak. If anybody finds it please post.

<TEXT> Using Hindi as a bridge language is a way of moving away from our colonial past. I have no doubts that within the next 100 years, not just India but the whole world would settle on a single official bridge language and that language is going to be English.

I have personally heard some northie Mumbaikars use insulting words to describe Marathis. And I support you and your party if you put those sort of trash in their place. But you should not be taking it out on some poor migrant who comes there just to make a living, as long as he behaves.

Incidentally, I know off one poor Marathi migrant who came to Chennai to make a living. We treat him like a God here now! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Would Raj Basha mean 'language of government'? Hindi should be the bridge language for all senior Central Government employees. All IAS trainees who want to work for the Central Government should learn hindi. By the same token, any IAS officer who wants to be part of a particular state cadre should be forced to learn the state's language. For example, if an IAS or IPS officer from outside Maharashtra wants to be a collector or DSP in Mumbai, knowing Marathi should be mandatory for him. If the people of Maha have chosen Marathi as the government language, then every senior official in the Maha government should learn Marathi. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was in school, hindi was an option and I took it since it is the obvious language to learn after tamil and english. Have never regretted the decision. I can understand about 80% of spoken hindi now, though I've forgotten how to read(lack of practice). Very useful while travelling outside TN or when talking to the huge number of migrants in Chennai or watching hindi movies. Left to themselves tamils would learn hindi for the same reasons, not because the government tells them its the 'rashtra basha' and every Indian should learn it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. Tamil is descended from Proto-Dravidian and Sanskrit from Indo-Iranian. Very different lineages. Having said that Tamil has absorbed a lot of words from North-Indian languages and vice-versa. It is also used in vedic rituals by Tamil brahmins, so it is not some alien language here. The opposition is really to the idea(or the ignorance) in the North, that Vedic Hinduism is the only form of Hinduism and Sanskrit is our only ancient language. Personally I am against anybody who claims their version of Hinduism, their culture, their  language or their food habits is more   important(or more Indian) than of people from other parts of the country.

The best way for the Central Government to make sure that Tamils never learn Hindi or Sanskrit is by telling them to learn it. That sounds like they are belittling Tamil culture. Lay off this issue for a few decades and people would automatically learn. </TEXT>

It's important to  be protective off your country and culture, but assholes taking advantage of nationalism and hindutva to achieve their own goals should be put down brutally. Nationalism, the economy and protecting people's rights are equally important, and this man has been delivering on all three fronts. I know some hardcore hindutvawadis here are going to be disappointed with him, but then they deserve to be disappointed. He had shown no signs of a hardcore hindutva agenda even when he was CM. </TEXT>

Now let me try a non-stupid sentence:

Muslims in India should know that they chose to stay in India after Partition, when they were given a choice not be secular and go to Pakistan, so they have a duty to stay secular, more than any other community. If they don't want to, they can still leave.

<TEXT> Siva said he didn't know whether Sasikala's behaviour had anything to do with the four "morphed" photos that had appeared before the May Assembly elections, showing the two MPs together. He denied any kind of relationship with Sasikala.

When the pictures appeared in April, Siva had been quick to say they were doctored. Sasikala had remained silent for over a week before releasing the same photos that now showed her with husband Lingeswaran.

The implication was that her husband's head had been replaced with Siva's using Photoshop. She had blamed it on an expelled AIADMK member.

<TEXT> The most popular President in India's history was a Muslim. I don't see why people won't vote for a capable, secular Muslim for PM. I would.

Muslims can also help by not voting for candidates who they think are good only for their community, but are good for the whole country. There are some genuine concerns that Muslims only look out for their own kind, and not others. A change in their voting patterns would go a long way in dispelling those fears. </TEXT>

Even within my caste, some sub-castes are classified as backward, making it easy to cheat the system. We have a lot of people from our village who were smart enough to claim that they are from that sub-caste years ago, and managed to get reservations. My ancestors migrated to Chennai generations ago, so they never could do this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Almost nobody eats beef in TN and very few people even cared about the controversy. Personally I am against the beef ban (though I don't eat beef) because what I eat or drink is my business and I would prefer the least laws regulating that.

As for an alcohol ban there would be much more opposition here if it comes through. While I can't speak for everybody here, I don't take an attempt to curb my personal liberties lightly, even though my alcohol supply is not going to be affected if there is a ban. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Note that she wants to ban alcohol in a "phased" manner. I suspect that the first phase which might involve closing the bars a bit earlier itself would last for 5 years.

This so called anti-alcohol movement in TN has been going on for the past 2-3 years now, primarily driven by some attention seeking activists. J has been against prohibition because it's the revenue from booze that has been financing her populist schemes. She is making these noises only to make sure that some of the female votes does not go to the DMK, which also has been saying it supports prohibition. Neither the DMK or J is going to enforce prohibition if they come to power, because then they would have to shut down all the populist schemes which would make them very unpopular.

Personally I am not worried by this because I get all my booze from Pondy nowadays. But even my friends who mostly buy from the TASMAC shops here are not bothered, since they think it's unlikely they would be closed down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not surprising that there aren't too many Indian citizens in this leak or the Swiss one. Money is stashed abroad primarily by Indian businessmen who export/import a lot, usually in the accounts of close relatives who are not Indian citizens. Richer families even settle their dumber children abroad just for this purpose. Some even hold money for other people for a fee (usually politicians, celebrities or other businessmen). Even if their names crop up in these leaks, they will just claim they have nothing to do with it.  We might see a lot more Indian names if there is a leak out of Dubai, Singapore or Hong Kong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No-one told me I was going to be interviewed by a Muslim.

I don't see what is anti-muslim about that. Mishal Husain who is a Pakistani born presenter was trying to make Suu Kyi say things which agreed more with her pro-Muslim view of the issue when she clearly didn't want to in [the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1BRn360e2M). If anybody was being biased here, it was Husain. But then it is blasphemous to call any journo biased. </TEXT>

CCTV footage shows a motorcycle driver with his 5 year old daughter being knocked down by a 20-meter-long truck waiting at the traffic lights in Taizhou, China. The child was thrown under the trailer while her father was trying to pull his daughter and the motorcycle out. The toddler escaped with minor injuries when the truck stopped. According to the local police, both vehicles violated traffic regulations.

<TEXT> Good job OP. Didn't know Hegel and Marx had any views at all about India. Mueller had never visited India AFAIK and Monier was a Christian bigot. And these two dudes had so much influence over colonial views of Hinduism which persists to this day. Husserl I know nothing about.

I suspect the whole concept of Brahmanism itself is a colonial one, giving prominence to the Vedas and focussing on a specific set of rituals as the whole of Hinduism. These European "oriental" experts, few of whom had ever visited India, probably found it easier to find Indian equivalents for the 19th century European concepts they were familiar with - Christianity=Hinduism, Bible=Vedas/Gita, Priest=Brahmin, Nobleman=Kshatriya, Serf=Dalit. This just does not reflect the far more complex situation we have here. For example, they tend to completely sideline the huge number of people for whom Lord Ram and the Ramayana is the primary source of religious belief or certain gods and belief systems in TN which probably predates the Ramayana and the Vedas. For me, everything is Hinduism. They saw Brahmins as representing the whole of Hinduism. The attack on Brahmins is just an attack on Hinduism.

Despite the European contempt for our caste system (and it deserves contempt) the 18th/19th century European serf was probably in a worse condition than the Dalits here. I used to read a lot about Indian history and I suspect neither the Dalits were as powerless as these experts would like us to believe nor the Brahmins as influential. There are a lot of incidents which talk of protests by caste groups demanding better terms from castes which employ them. And also conflict between caste groups, like right-handed and left-handed castes. There also seems to have been a lot of movement within the caste systems. For example (so called) lower castes and tribal groups gaining prominence during the Vijayanagar era.

Looking forward to your post on Bishop Caldwell now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kissing and making out among themselves is a second choice. Usually the men prefer harassing and molesting women they have no chance of getting, to boost their own self-esteem. The fugly women turn in to sour-grapes feminists and convince themselves all men are evil. One thing common between molesters, feminists and liberals is a very low self-esteem. It is not surprising many so called liberals turn out to be molesters. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah! a clown/jester/troll. I remember when I was a kid we went on a school trip to the zoo. Some of us kids stood outside the lion's enclosure and threw peanuts at them, hitting one male lion in the face and pissing him off. We were so thrilled that we repeated the same thing with the elephants. We must have been about 3 or 4 feet tall then but we felt so powerful and strong. It didn't even matter that the animals could have killed us with one swipe if the bars weren't there.

Now that I am all grownup I think it was all silly, but who cares when you are a dumb, stupid, powerless kid whom nobody gives a shit about. Any sort of attention is worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you zoom in you will see colored dots on the gif. This is because of a process called error diffusion the gif maker would have used to make the 256 color limitation bearable. The gif also has a low frame rate (usually 5-15 frames/sec) to keep the file size manageable. But it is still a very well made gif, probably uses a custom color palette. 

Wish I could explain that better but it is morning here and now I have a boner to deal with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Long answer:

There are two types of files we call gifs. The older gif format (which is from the 80s) is actually an image format with multiple images packed in a single file to form an animation. The files are huge because there is very little compression and the quality is very low because there can only be 256 color values in the gif. The newer gif format what we call a "gifv" is actually a video file without sound. It is as efficient size wise as any other video format. It can also contain millions of colors, so it is high quality.

Gfycat and Imgur primarily host the new "gifv" format. You can enter a Youtube address and starting time and they will convert it to gifv files of less than 15 seconds and they absolutely do not allow longer gifvs. But to allow people to host their older gif format files on their servers, they allow you to upload old gif files directly from your computer. Since these files are already in the gif format they can be any length you want it to be. Gif specialists on Reddit use this loop hole by downloading videos and converting them into the old gif format on their computers and then upload these huge files to Imgur. Imgur in turn would optimize these files by converting them to gifvs. It is a long process which requires special software and a lot of time and patience. It is definitely not for somebody who make a gifv of interesting videos they come across on Youtube in a few minutes and post, which is what most Redditors like me do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Imgur and Gfycat have a 15 second limit unfortunately. Most redditors won't click on a video link because of the sound and the length. You won't find video links at the top of this sub or most others. It is always difficult choosing between these two choices. I posted the [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDQw21ntR64) in another comment, maybe you would want to check it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read an interesting history behind this. After MGR died, the party tried to completely sideline her by making MGR's wife the party chief. They openly called her a whore and even pulled her sari in the assembly. She is supposed to have gone through hell during this period. After that, she split the party and won the elections using the anger against Karuna after Rajiv Gandhi's assassination. The party people who had treated her so badly before her win, went back to her and shamelessly started kow towing to her, calling her "Amma". She took most of them back, but demanded absolute subservience.

She is silly to have promoted this sort of behavior, but I am more disgusted by the people who do the actual kow towing. There are absolutely no self-respecting people left in her party. Even the ministers have very little power, she rules through a set of handpicked bureaucrats. The positive side to this is that the ministers and MLAs are so scared of her and her absolute power that very few of them are corrupt. There is still a lot of corruption in TN but most of the money probably goes to the party and her circle. Ruling through bureaucrats and the top cops directly has also made the administration much more efficient. This is the reason she is still so popular. The downside is that there is nobody to run the party after her. The BJP might have a big opportunity here if they manage to find some charismatic leaders in the long term. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This article describes the Nehruvian era more accurately than anything I've read before

"Marxist historians, Macaulays colonially-seduced bureaucrats, faux secular intellectuals, compromised journalists, and sycophantic politicians worshipping at the altar of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty."

"Left-leaning povertarian economics"

["Nehru was colonys child and allowed himself to be swayed more often than was good for India by the Anglo-German charms of Lord Mountbatten"](http://i.imgur.com/gb9EiA1.jpg) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Until recently, most North Indians I knew used to be proud of their "european" ancestry compared to the "indians" down south. Now they all want to prove they are the most Indian of all. That's progress. One thing the Hindutva movement has done is made people get over their colonial inferiority complex and take pride in their own heritage. The Dravidian movement did something very similar in the south 75 years ago. Going beyond the political aspects of these two movements, they play a very important role in the cultural evolution of our country.

The next step for north indians would be to shed their Afghan inspired clothing and start wearing lungies. And start eating fish, your ancestors the Harappans ate a lot of that </TEXT>

Edit: Add info

A woman had a lucky escape after a car smashed into a highway service station, narrowly missing her on Saturday (January 16).

Surveillance camera footage shows the car ploughing through the front glass wall of the service station shop in a south western suburb of Sydney, with the woman being thrown to the ground from the impact of the crash. Moments later she can be seen getting to her feet having avoided serious injury.

According to local media, it is not known what caused the crash. 

Three occupants of the car were treated by paramedics and taken to hospital. A fourth man, believed to be the driver, was missing. </TEXT>

Going by his ability to put his foot in his mouth he also seems to be enormously dumb, even by Bollywood standards.

Three women miraculously survived a traffic accident on Saturday when the motorcycle they were riding on was knocked over by a truck. 

Surveillance video showed the motorcycle crossing the road in front of the trucks blind spot right after a red light turned green. The truck then hit the motorcycle when it started moving. Luckily for the three women, the truck was moving very slowly, so they rolled out of harm's way just in time.

One of the women suffered a minor injury to her knee, while the other two got away without a scratch. 

The accident happened in the city of Beiliu, south Chinas Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

<TEXT> So the same species of whales(pilot whales) beach near the same village (Manapad near Tuticorin) twice, [once on 14 January, 1973](http://epubs.icar.org.in/ejournal/index.php/IJF/article/view/12396) and on 12 January, 2016. Both the place and time of year match perfectly. Also El Nino effect was [very strong in both Jan 1973 and Jan 2016](http://ggweather.com/enso/oni.jpg). Too many coincidences here, I doubt if it has anything to do with volcanoes or earthquakes. It is speculated that [whale echolocation systems can have difficulty picking up very gently-sloping coastlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_stranding#Natural). Could be the case here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Photo by Stephen Wilkes](http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/2016/01/05/piecing-together-time-in-the-ultimate-brain-puzzle/)


Wilkes spent two weeks in the Serengeti scouting locations and getting permission from the park to photographnot an easy task, as security around the park at night is tight on account of poachers. He initially wanted to photograph the peak migration but arrived during a five-week drought, when the animals werent following their normal patterns. What seemed like a bad card ended up being a boon when he found a watering hole that attracted elephants, zebras, wildebeests, meerkats, and hippos.

Photographing an animal narrative, as opposed to a human one, was a first for Wilkes, yet in doing it he discovered a valuable lesson.

Theres such a beautiful message in this photograph, he says. The animals essentially were starved for water, and they all shared. I watched them for 26 hours [as they] literally all [took] turns drinking, bathing in this single resource. And they never so much as even grunted at each other. You realize the animals really get it. And we have really yet to understand the idea of water [as] a shared resource.

Wilkes and his assistant spent 30 hours perched on a platform 18 feet in the air, behind a crocodile blind so the animals wouldnt see them. The elephant family marched across the frame just as he and his assistant had resumed shooting after taking a break to back up their files (each shoot takes about 20 gigabytes of storage). Had they passed five minutes earlier, he would have missed them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Russell's viper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WvnjCkLbvY), a common snake in India but highly venomous. Professional snake catchers are more scared of this snake than any other, including cobras and kraits. Bites from venomous snakes are not fatal if anti-venom is injected in time, but [this snake's venom can do crazy things to you](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5878200/the-snake-whose-bite-can-send-you-back-through-puberty) even if you survive.

It looks a lot like a python, so people approach it thinking it is non-venomous and pay the price. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you first make a gif from the video in the old gif image format and then upload it to imgur, it can be as long as you want it to be. The old gif format is low quality compared to the new gifv/webm format. If you want to host a gifv on imgur, you have to convert from a video url on imgur itself. And imgur does not allow you to make a gifv longer than 15 seconds. AFAIK. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Think the idea is to make sure the fin does not break the water surface and reveal themselves, assuming the seals don't know that they are out there. These are the famous Patagonian orcas which beach themselves deliberately to catch the seals, so surprise is very important. Of course it is entirely possible that they are swimming sideways for different reasons as explained in the comment above. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The comments on Youtube mention Hyderabad/Muslim-girl/Hindu-boy. Don't know anything more, I can't even understand the Hindi/Urdu they are speaking.

Edit: Google came up with this:
[Moral Policing? Boy beaten up for dating a Muslim girl](
http://daily.bhaskar.com/news-np/TOP-a-boy-got-beaten-publicly-by-group-of-boys-5172558-NOR.html)

Amid news of growing intolerance in India, a video is being shared on social media which apparently shows a boy being beaten up for dating a Muslim girl.
 
According to reports, the boy was beaten when he stepped out of a movie theatre in Hyderabad with a female friend dressed in a veil.
 
The group not only beat the boy but also harassed the girl.
 
The video is being widely shared with a message - Secular Guys beating a boy who was with Secular Girl at a theater in Hyderabad, Time to identify the Secular Gang and inform police.
 
We request everyone to share the video to help identify the perpetrators.

<TEXT> Nothing like hard data to put growth in perspective. Some interesting things that struck me:

Places like Bihar, UP, Jharkhand, Assam and MP have 1/3rd the per capita income of states like Maharashtra and TN. No wonder so many people travel all the way to Chennai and Mumbai for low paying jobs.

The good news is, some of the poorest states like Bihar, Jharkhand, MP and Assam have relatively high growth rates. TN/Puducherry/Gujarat have high growth rates inspite of having high per capita income.

From being the richest state in India, Punjab is not even among the front runners anymore. It is slowly falling into the middle income category now. Neighbouring states like Haryana, Uttarkhand and HP are doing well.

The only hopeless state in India right now is UP, very low income along with low growth rate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What!! Just because I give the video source for the gifs I post I'm hired by these companies? I post gifs from videos I like from my Youtube subscriptions. Let me give you the viral channels on my YT subscription list - Jukin video, AFV, Kyoot kids, Fullscreenvirals, Fail army, Slow Mo guys, Kyoot animals, Break clips, Rumble viral, Dailypicks, Viral hog, Roadcams, Barcroft, Liveleak channel, Caters news- and I must have posted gifs and videos on Reddit from all these channels . Are you telling me everybody is paying me? I have also posted many gifs from CCTV news, some Indian channels, Russian sources, dashcam channels, etc, are you telling me they are also paying me? Wish they did, I would kick my programming job and browse Reddit and Youtube the whole day. </TEXT>

A truck self-ignited in a tunnel on Lanhai highway in southwest Chinas Guizhou Province on Friday morning. Forced to quickly consider what would happen if the truck exploded within the tunnel and the huge dangers it could bring to him and everyone around, the driver chose to risk his life to drive the truck safely out of the tunnel. Firefighters arrived shortly and extinguished the fire. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

In a bid to disrupt traffic and get the attention of the police, an elderly woman decided to lie down on a busy intersection in the city of Wuhu in Anhui Province. Unfortunately, before she could manage to grab any attention, a car ran over here. The driver had not realized that the woman had been lying on the ground. Soon after the accident, footage shows the driver exiting the car and attempting to assist the woman. She was immediately rushed to a local hospital and is said to be receiving treatment. </TEXT>
