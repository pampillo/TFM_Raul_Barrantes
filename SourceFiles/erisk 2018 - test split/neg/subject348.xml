<TITLE> What do you think is the biggest Film Spoiler of 2017 so far? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-24 17:31:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know there hasn't been too many major block busters released this year as of yet, so loosely including late last year, What's the biggest spoiler you could give to someone who has yet to watch a single film in all of 2017, including plot points, character deaths, and also Film announcements made this year?

If there are too few contenders so far, then how about if you include tv series released in 2017.


 

And though this is obviously inviting any and all spoiler discussions, lets also try and use the spoiler tag just to be a little courteous! *

<TEXT> tbf there's an awful lot to take from the CLIP (:p). i dont mean to make it come across that aldo has really bad head movement in general, cause that's not true. It's just that this specific video isn't a very good example of head movement regardless of the fighter or context and i think it's definitely important to distinguish between a just 'okay' technique and the good

I'd actually be interested to know if anyone disagrees and thinks this is a good example (it's not :P). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dunno, He'd better be careful with that head movement. He looked absolutely awesome in the Frankie fight at 200, but quicker doesn't necessarily mean better. 

Solely going off this clip (keeping in mind it's short af and realisitically hard to take anything from) it's nice to see him anticipating the strikes but i mean cmon, he bites on the feint which is something a more technical fighter (also one not sparring obviously) could land a quicker cross from, especially the way aldo just moves his head to the side rather than moving closer to the elbow. And then he slips the other way into the cross anyway which is like..not good :P It'd be nice to see him mix the head movement with his positioning as well, staying on the end of punches is a good way to get clipped, i like his pivot at the end though, that was nice :P 

at the end of the day, it's a short clip we can't tell much from, i'm sure he's done 100 different examples of the same thing all perfectly, but from this clip alone (and i mean just this clip alone), that wasn't a good example of someone with good head movement. Aldo is a beast for sure and he's shown godly head movement in the past, but unfortunatley this clip isn't that </TEXT>

<TEXT> yeah this exactly, you could sorta reason it at first, but its gotten to the point where you're just cutting their legs from under them by continually separating wrestlers from CW guys.

At first i guess you could kinda see it as a way to establish and make stand out the main stars of the CW division, but then they just did nothing with it, and its gotten to the point where you're totally right, they feel so disconnected from everything and everyone they could literally just not appear on Raw one night and you wouldn't even notice which is pretty lame </TEXT>

<TEXT> yeah tbh this is definitely the likely scenario. I guess it gives the midcard of the CW division (is this a thing?) some depth. Would just be nice to see something come of it, especially with the long list of guys in line for a title already. The entire division seems to kind of just be dawdling around waiting for a match with Neville or Aries, so it would be nice if this feud led to a tag team or something kinda interesting away from the title i guess, give the other guys something to do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> i'd love to see Akira and Crews team up, i think that could only be good for both guys (especially Crews at the moment).

I am really hoping they quit it with the 'wrestlers' and the 'cruiserweight division' soon though, would open up a lot of interesting matches letting the cruiserweights match up against anyone like they used to have it, especially considering a lot top guys are pretty much technically cruiserweights, it seems silly to keep them separate  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think this feud has been a bit under the radar (fair enough considering Wrestlemania and all), but for some reason i've just really enjoyed this feud, especially its slow burn. Maybe it's cause i'm a big fan of both guys and dont want either to fade away inbto obscurity that i've become so invested, but it also just feels like a nice change up from what is otherwise turning into a draining experience (frustrations with bookings etc) in the main event scene.

Anyway i haven't really got anythign to say about the feud other than just wanting to talk about it, so if any of you have been watching it, any ideas where it might go? It feels like a pretty unique feud and I get the feeling they might end up in a tag team similar to Sheamus/Cesaro </TEXT>

though it's important to remember as awkward and shit as the kick looks - and it looks awkward af - from memory his game plan was to throw unorthodox strikes, namely kicks, so the shitty kick is kinda forgivable given his intentions. though it is a dreadful kick indeed, 100% :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of (great) examples from more recent cards, so if you wanted to dig a little deeper UFC 92 main card was one of the best cards I remember watching, especially if you give a little context for the fights beforehand. 
Same for UFC 113 I think from memory.

Otherwise Silva v sonnen 1 will surely produce a great narrarive, though might be a little submission heavy especially without he context of who Silva is (could maybe show them the griffin fight and leben and franklin fight first?) 

If they'd be the ones keen for a brawl the recent cub v choi fight is perfect! But if they're likely to appreciate crisper and more technique, Edgar v Sherk is sure to impress or maybe shogun v griffin 1 (but that was a really long.time ago and so maybe it was shit or a brawl, I can't remember!) and if you wanted a more varied matchup with a good mix of standup and ground courier v nogueria is jumping to the top of my mind for some reason but I havent watched it in a long time so maybe it was shit also! :p 

Lastly there's a bunch of pride fights you could show them fedor v cro.cop, nog v bob Sapp (for the freak show fight fan in all of us), rampage v arona etc.

The fight that actually got me into MMA though was gsp v Hughes 1 which is unfortunate as neither is really.fighting right now. But just the variation.of the fight and then that finish oooh! :p

 but that's a personal fave, everyone has their own and for their own reason, so is really recommend any suggestion from this post, all are great. and just show them some of your favourite ones too, that way its easy to give context and create a narrative for them to invest in (like I remember getting my so interested just by explaining.to her on a pretty long bus ride the career of Frank Mir, becoming the champ, losing.the belt, over.coming real adversity to finally beat nogueria and win back the 'title'etc - but.now I'm just rambling!!)

Any way, hope this helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah same here! I never really cared for her character, and exactly as you put it, she was 'an extra' but this season she's probably become one of the more interesting characters, who's also a complete badass. 

and her story is cool, like genuinely cool! Her wanting revenge after losing abraham, and both before and after negan, and losing her friend in glenn, and now going to be dealing with her actions leading to Olivia's death and Eugene's misfortune is one of the more interesting character stories going on right now and im very very excited and intrigued to see where this badass character goes next </TEXT>

<TEXT> he landed nice kicks, but would you really consider the guy who would flop the moment he thinks he might get hit the better striker? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dunno, it's pretty hard to get behind a dude whose main technique is to flop to the ground every time he thought he might get hit. 

He had very quick kicks and landed a good couple of hook kicks, and I mean, sure props to him for having trained so hard and making his ground gamer that scary, but as a fighter, that was ridiculous.
Every time his opponent came into any range where he couldn't throw his distance kicks he would flop. no technique involved, just outright flopped. Who does that, and would that not be considered aggressively disengaging? it was terrible man and then to complain that maynard wouldn't engage when that was exactly what he was doing. 

(sure maynard should have engaged in his ground game you could argue, but at the same time i definitely think the onus should be on the ground specialist to get it to the floor, flopping down at the first sign of trouble can't really be considered a position you've 'earned')  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah no worries man, each to their own. It's a pretty different sound to what we've been given by donald before, and i've got a lot of friends  who have been a bit put off by it. 

I think a lot of it just comes down to giving it a chance, but also accepting that sometimes its okay to have different tastes and preferences. just enjoy the music man! Whatever sound that may be for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> While a significant part of the video, my focus isn't on the tackle, but rather the reaction of demonstrators after the fact. So while you raise a very interesting point (like i had no idea that he has aspergers, and i really appreciate the sharing of a source), i think i was sharing this with the understanding that political alignment had no relevance in the video

admittedly that's probably on me for mentioning their alignment in the title. But yeah i merely meant to share here because of its setting and the turn of events after the tackle </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, i'd much rather distance myself from that subreddit

My issue with this situation is less about gendered biases but rather the exploitation of personal issues for a better story, and the tv station playing a role (right or wrong) in matters where they otherwise had no right to do so

Also just to be clear i dont mean to suddenly jump down your throat, whether you were simply making an observation or simply hold different beliefs is totally cool. i just felt the need to justify where i was coming from with my point. we both seem to agree on the fact that there wasn't enough information available for anyone to intervene let alone a third party tv station with their own intentions. so yeah i agree, fuck those tv station guys!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> i dont know, its pretty difficult to get a full picture of all this. In no way do i condone abandoning children, nor should anyone else for that matter (does this need to be expressed?). 
but it's definitely an issue where the only people who know what happened are the people involved, and if he stole away his family he's a bit of a dick, but it sorta works both ways in a he said she said way which i think became outstandingly messy when tv ratings got involved  </TEXT>
