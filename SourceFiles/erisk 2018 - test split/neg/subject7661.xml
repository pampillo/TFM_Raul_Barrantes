<TEXT> Yeah just pure terpenes. A lot of times weed just lacks taste but still gets you high. So buying normal quality or even below par taste weed, you could add this and make the weed taste good.

<TEXT> I completely agree with both your statements. I don't believe in 50 1g. It's just what is happening right now. I've probably smoked chinky bud but I'd never buy it again once I have. Some of the weed that comes out of them weed houses is crap. The thing is it still gets sold. Whether it gets mixed in with good bud or sold as fat bags. Your just wasting rizla rolling it. It's never cured right. When it's being cured. That's when they most vulnerable to robbers so want it sold asap. They want to chop and cash in as quick as possible. If they were growing same quality as Cali weed. We all be happy lol.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I'm guessing we must just have very different mindset when it comes to weed. 
I'm not justifying anything. I posted just so people could see. Dam weed  amp; Cali weed are very different to normal weed(lemon/cheese). Strains vary and what you can  amp; cant get depends on location and mainly dealers. 
I can tell there's a big difference in all weed. I'm not gonna smoke some cheap shit chinaman grown weed just because I can get Q for 50. If it tastes like crap and don't get me high what's the point. 50 1g of imported Cali is worth it in that situation. You can't just say all weed is the same. It's not or you wouldn't have everyone with new strain every week. If you can't taste the difference in different strains then clearly you won't be interested in import weed. 
I never bought 50 1g. The worlds a big place. People smoke differently. Look at USA. Legalisation has created this high end weed market. It's made its way over here. If you can't see the difference in quality of the weed. Then you won't appreciate that the costs involved differ too </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you smoked Cali before? Or is what your saying  right just because you think it is?

I get you feel like it's not worth it. I agree that weed grown in warehouse in Cali, can   should be grown here the same. That is not the case. Prices reflect that. I've smoked Cali weed in Cali. Also been Denver, seen and smoked out there too. Nothing that's grown here is as good as that. I love you to prove me wrong. Like to see this weed your getting that's better for cheaper. Please post some pictures. Enlighten me to your vast knowledge of weed. 
If you picking up 2g of standard lemon/cheese and are trying to compare that to Cali. Then don't bother  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1.4 scores are normal. In east London. Ammi bags are never more. Get some good dealers with lemon bags 1.8. Like I said. 50 1g of Cali. Is very common. People go mad at the prices. No one telling you to buy it. If you want to smoke Cali. That's what it costs. Unless you can get to DNM. 50 is a lot. Totally agree. Depending on quality of weed. Prices vary. It's not like old school. 20 8ths. You won't pay more 10 1g but your not smoking the same quality weed either. 
I'm not saying expensive is better. Cali bud costs that much. You didn't smoke it. I can't tell you this was a lot better than anything you might have in your allotment  </TEXT>

I honestly believed I was getting a good deal paying 30 1g for Cali. I pay 220 for my amnesia haze oz. I know that's expensive too but you have to pay or I don't get anything. Just need better dealers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep! they put it in a 50p plastic pot off eBay and sell it as Cali. 220z good weed in east London. Can get 180 but that quality bud don't get me high.  
Cheese, lemon  amp; amnesia is all that's about in east London. That I can get hold off anyway. Lots of Cali skunk but 50 1g is something I'm not willing to pay. 
There's a lot of spainsh amnesia about. Looks  amp; smells lovely but you can smoke a whole oz  amp; wont get high. It's good your getting good strains and right price. U.K. Growers need to grow proper strains and wouldn't be a need for Cali import. Locking up a China man in a house and expecting top quality bud ain't gonna happen. Enjoy the smoke.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm doing the Route 66 journey from la/Santa Monica to Chicago. Going via Dallas. Meeting cousin there who's joining the journey. 
I really want to visit a medical marijuana dispensary just to see what it's like. Also would love to visit a weed farm in Cali but mainly I want to smoke the Cali bud that sells for 50 1gram in London. Obviously I know dispensaries won't sell to me but love to get some edibles that I can eat discretely while driving through non legal states. I know I won't be able to get weed whole trip. I have to smoke Cali bud in Cali. If any of you guys have any suggestions. I'd love to hear from you. Thanks   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very interesting way of rolling. I honestly think it's a very long way. I was about to say "normal" way is best. Guess this way is normal to the Danish. I like making sure weed/tobacco is evenly spread throughout joint. Think this method makes it difficult to have it spread evenly. I'm too high for this. All this talk of rolling is making me want to roll joint now. 
Maybe I'll try it the Danish way. 

I'm Surprised at lack of anti tobacco comments from the AmericEnts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really hope it is legalised here in the uk. They will when they realise how much  they government can make for the business side of cannabis. Over 10 years ago most of the weed was imported and actually cost less than it does now. However most of the weed in uk is now grown here in the uk. In 10 years box(1kg/36oz) has gone from 2,500-3000 upto 6500-7000+. Depending on quality of course. All this attracts a very nasty criminal element to business. As much as you can deal with good dealers you will always have to deal with some nasty scum bags from time to time. Police used to be so chilled when it come to weed. 90% of the time your let off with warning(verbal no record) but now they seem to want to give out police cautions for the smallest amounts. Although it's still fair, cautions can stay on record for up to 5 years. Think if they was to decriminalise small amounts 1st, then maybe they might start to think about legalisations. 

Signed government petition for them to discuss matter in the House of Commons but they didn't receive enough signatures. They also emailed a response in which they stated the reason they wouldn't legalise cannabis. They main arguments from what I remember where they felt that it has no medical values   it's the main cause of schizophrenia in uk. It was long email   I was high but sure they were main 2 points. 

Here's to hoping we can be smoking legally here in uk soon but best not wait   spark your joint anyway.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whether something is morally right or wrong is down to opinion. Everyone has different morals. I haven't been through it but you saying you don't remember it anyway doesn't mean it wasn't painful at the time. I think docking tails is morally wrong. Other people may not. Obviously we will not agree in this matter.  I could bring in female circumcision. Do you feel that's morally wrong? In Africa it's common practice but illegal here in the uk. Opinions   morals differ. I find the practice of docking barbaric. Feel same about circumcision. You said docking was a non issue because that's how you feel about docking. I'm completely against it   It wouldn't be illegal here in uk if it was a non-issue.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you say it like that. You make me sound like the crazy person. I'm just saying docking tails for pure aesthetic purposes is wrong and the fact that you don't remember the pain does not make it acceptable. That's especially applies to circumcision. Unless it's your religious beliefs, no way can putting a baby through pain be acceptable. I'm from the uk. Only reason babies are circumcised over here is religious. I'm assuming your America where I here it's more common the other way round. 
Puppies   babies might not remember the pain but as a human being the thought of putting them from any type of pain. For aesthetic reasons only. Is unacceptable. In my opinion.   </TEXT>

Wrong on every level. 
Banned here in uk for good reason.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(dog)

As for circumcision. That's down to your beliefs. You can cut off half your dick if you want. Just cause someone don't remember doesn't mean it didn't hurt at the time.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Huge risk of getting downvoted. His tail has been docked. There's a few methods of how this is done but none of which are humane. Basically tie string or band really tight around base off tail when they are puppy. This cuts off blood supply and after tail will not grow   kind of die. It's then cut off. There are other methods, I'm not sure I'm 100% correct myself. Docking tails is common for working dogs in past when tails could get injured, while dog is working usually done for larger breeds of dogs.  Docking tails now are just so dogs look better   you can post pics/gifs of cute dog butts. The puppy suffered for this so make sure everyone upvotes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This kind of makes situation worse because there's always been "honour among thieves" that clearly these guys don't follow. If they got caught   weren't expecting too then they should've held their hands up   returned what's yours. Imagine this. You leave it alone but next party you guys are all at a party, drink   drugs   guns don't mix. You could end up doing something much worse than confronting these assholes now. 
Generally in groups some people are in the middle. You need to find someone both sides respect or fear. That can sort this out without a war because that's your only other option. Start cracking heads. They won't try it again. But this could alienate some of your friends in this group. Don't play the victim be the bigger man. Let all friends know what's happened. If you are in good group of "friends"  others in this group should be able to pressure the scumbags into knowing they done wrong   have to make it right. I'm sure most of your friends won't want to be friends with this lot knowing that they would steal from you. 
You hustle in silence from now on or you do something about it. 
I'd let everyone know what happened   let people know that shit will go down. Speak to friends who you know will go and tell them everything. That way they will get message. Honestly don't go into this half hearted. They already robbed you   probably won't have issues beating your ass. If your not the type of person who is willing to fight. Then don't get into the fight. You can live happily   peacefully being the nice guy. Sometimes the war will cause you more trouble than the theft. Just comes down to how you want to react.

The rest of the world does generally follow Usa on their good points. So hopefully they pick up on this. 

Most skunk is grown in here in the uk. Now there's q big problem with violent criminals robbing grow houses. Creating more work for the police. They already got road side drug test here. 
It's all about education not enforcement. Until they figure out how to tax it government won't want to get involved.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mate. I've tried before. I'll give it another shot. Everything you guys smoke you call weed. But over here when you ask for weed you get either commercial weed, Thai weed or hi-grade weed. That's the 3 types of weed we have over here. Then you have skunk which is the general name given to all high strength cannabis(lemon haze, cheese,amnesia haze the 3 most common types I get). which is what most people smoke and get more easily then weed.  They are completely different  in every way; different look, smell, taste  amp; buzz. 
Most skunk smokers won't touch weed  amp; a lot of weed smokers wouldn't smoke skunk. 

Here's the link.

<TEXT> I posted this before but basically got down voted because what we(uk) call skunk is what Usa calls weed. They call all cannabis plants weed. We however have 2 types of cannabis "weed"   "skunk". Obviously this is local terminology and USA ents. Will not agree but as you are a Londoner like myself. I can assure you that this is how we class cannabis in London. When you read in papers or articles about skunk. That is the type of cannabis your dealer is supplying. 90% of people I know who smoke all smoke skunk. However a few people smoke only weed because "it don't fry your brain". I smoke both. 
Here's a pic of Thai weed. It's nowhere near as good as skunk but honestly it's a different level/type of buzz. Like comparing beer   vodka. When you just want to chill have a beer. If you wanna get fucked up open bottle of vodka. That's how I like to compare the two. Weed   skunk are very very different. Weed looks like this  http://i.imgur.com/0S0F41B.jpg

Here's a pic of Thai weed. Nowhere near as good as skunk but a lot of people still smoke it. Don't taste as good either. I like to explain it simply as weed is like beer  amp; skunk is like vodka or whisky. Strength wise.

<TEXT> Weed   skunk are different it's like trying to compare beer   vodka! This weed is grown exactly how it should be. Generally Weed smokers won't smoke skunk   skunk smokers won't smoke weed. I smoke both. Your response is typical of a skunk smoker when offered weed. 
I'm just showing you the two types over here in uk because a lot of people have been getting confused with recent studies that have come out where they refer to skunk! 
Here's an example for you, A lot of people think Bob Marley smoked skunk. He didn't he smoked weed. 
There's a big difference in both taste, appearance   chemical effect on your body   brain.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Made a comment recently regarding weed  amp;amp; skunk! Although people class it the same, they are very different. Here in the uk you can get Thai weed, commercial weed or hi-grade. All forms of weed  amp;amp; have low thc compared with skunk which is much higher in thc. I'd class then as different plants. Most skunk smokers won't Smoke weed  amp;amp; vice versa. I smoke both. Only way to describe it is like the difference between beer  amp;amp; vodka(or strong spirit)!

Ch 4 in uk done a documentary "drugs live" which they compared the two. Skunk  amp;amp; weed are different.   

Here's pic of Thai weed

<TEXT> Ahh cool. I Never knew. I'm got my information from a interesting documentary/experiment that's was done on ch 4 in the uk. It was called "drugs live" back in March. It compared weed with skunk. Most people call skunk weed. I've always classed them separately. But the main difference between the two was skunk is high in thc low in cbd. Weed was high in cbd and low in thc. Obviously thc may be a cannaboid. But think they were referring to them separately. I personally see them as very different too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's Thai weed Or Thai stick. That's what we call it here in uk. Strangely called Thai weed over there too, well not that strange. 
It was good Thai weed but Not very good and not really comparable to skunk tbh. Very high in CBD(cannaboids) but low thc!  What they had on the island was a lot better than what I got in Bangkok. I got pics. Just not sure how to upload pic without uploading as post.  

I smoke Thai weed here aswell as skunk but you just can't compare the two. Like comparing beer   vodka lol.

<TEXT> Just looks like bit of garbage that's got mixed in! Dealers are not the most hygienic! Probably dirt off table or wherever he was bagging up. Throw   enjoy the smoke. Weed looks good. One off my dealer friends mum used to have loads of cats. Always have to check for cat hairs in his weed bags. But that's got me into a good habit of checking weed as your rolling. If it's not weed then throw it. 
Agree with 1st comment. Needs to be legalised. 

Here in the uk. A lot of Vietnamese are in the growing trade. They don't smoke so don't care about smokers just . Was a period quite few years back of them using. Fine grade sand or something like that to mimic thc. Used to have loads off the stuff at bottom of the bag. Definitely wasn't thc. Very rare now because everyone basically grows or knows a good grower. Most of that shit grown stuff ends up in Scotland or Ireland. No one smoking that crap here(London). So it don't happen anymore,  that I know off  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Phi phi island is where you can smoke openly according to everyone but I still kept it low key! Trust me a lot of people don't. Hot girls in bikinis where just blazing it up. While sun bathing. I chose to hide in the shade. Cops are probably not gonna be as nice to me as they are with them. Still one of the best places I've ever smoked. 

You can hire them boats   driver will pretty much let you do what you want. Thai weed not as good as the skunk I normally smoke.  </TEXT>

And his not Maine coon. Would love to have that breed of cat someday. His normal uk shorthair ginger Tom. He was the runt of the litter so I was told but his still quite big. Forget banana for scale but his 2foot head to tail. (Was gonna make a bad joke bout him being 3 foot lol)

<TEXT> Thanks for advice but really think if your cat is going to be going outside like all cats should do. Then they will need claws for climbing, fighting etc.  His 9 years old now, only got 3 legs, so don't go out much now but I've never had to cut his nails. He always looked after them himself. Besides no one would be able to cut his nails. I'm sure his evil!

<TEXT> Well now way is chelsea a bigger club than arsenal in terms of fans worldwide or local! That can be seen by ticket sales   revenue from merchandise! Chelsea have won more recently yes but that don't make them bigger  most premiership clubs that have won cups sellout don't make them bigger tho!
Man city couldn't sell their allocation of tickets for community shield @Wembley but they have won more than arsenal recently   more than chelsea but that make them a big club  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chelsea has a lot more fans in USA because they been touring the country during preseason. Wenger doesn't like to make players travel far before start of season. But we did travel to far easy last year! We have a lot more Asian fans than chelsea! 


This is the current Forbes valuation!

All I can say is that chelsea fans are like the new Man U lot! Glory hunters!

As arsenal fan let me tell u, times are bad but they still charge you 90 a ticket to see ur team lose to Man U. How seats do u think would be empty at Chelsea's ground if they started losing? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mum battled it for long time. Longer than anyone could expect. She was strongest person I know. Last couple years though she couldn't fight it. 
Royal Brompton hospital treated her more like a test guinea pig than person. Nurses   staff great. But for Dr. Seem like they was using her for case study. Never saw same dr twice. Only met prof in charge if clinic twice. Just my expirence of royal Brompton. She died over 2 years ago. Life changes after. Things never go back to how they were. If they can find cure or help live with symptoms then worth the effort.  </TEXT>
