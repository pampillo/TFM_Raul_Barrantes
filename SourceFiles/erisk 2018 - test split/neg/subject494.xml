<TEXT> As an asian kid in a white-majority school, I was always embarrassed to pull out my elaborate bento-boxes while all the other kids had ham sandwiches and PB J. All I wanted was a white-kid lunch. All these years later I realize how lucky I was to have a mother that cooked an amazing Japanese lunch every day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Series of Unfortunate Events really got me started into reading as a young child. Short, addicting stories that get longer and longer to warm you up to the "big boy books". Not everything is so flowery and perfect so it gets you out of the "everything always ends up okay" mindset that you are so used to seeing in elementary reading. </TEXT>

<TEXT> cooking, but more specifically breakfast. There have been countless times where I wake up hungry and have been able to fix myself some nice eggs and toast, or even an omelette in quick time. Otherwise you have to drag yourself out of bed to go out or just warm up some pop tarts. For other meals, you have a lot more time to prepare and you're already out.  </TEXT>
