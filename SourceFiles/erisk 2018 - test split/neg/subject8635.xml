<TEXT> The birth of Leah

My name is Cornelia.  Not Cory, Lee, Lia, Leah, Nelly CORNELIA.  And for the guys who think it is funny to make my name male: Im not Cornelio or Cornelius either.  Named after my mothers grandmother, who was a short lady.  I guess I got more than just the old womans name.  Everyone in my family is freakishly tall, like giant-esque type of tall. My eldest brother had to bow his head to get into a normal doorway.  With the result that everything, and everywhere, we had custom-made high doors and ceilings.  My family was a bunch of freaks well, except for me.  Mum told me that my great grandmother Cornelia was also short.  Im not short in the eyes of society, but in the eyes of my family Im a short ass.

**That's right, a motherfucking short ass who -**

My name is Cornelia.  Im 23 and Im an education student.  I live with my parents and my puppy, Kira.  My mum and I are just great  Im very close with my mum.  My mum knows all my secrets, shes my best friend in the world.

**Or she did know all of my secrets.  She likes to think that she does, but she's an ignorant old twat who -**

I have four siblings.  Two brothers and two sisters, all of them older than me.  I was born in 1994, in April, while my youngest sibling was eight years my senior, and my oldest sibling was fifteen years my senior.  I wasnt close to any of them.  Just my mum.  My youngest sibling left home when I was about ten years old, and I honestly cant remember much from my first decade on this eart.  I just remember tiny bursts  me fucking with a claw machine, kicking my mum, giving stepsister-to-be bread, playing on an old black-and-white computer with my brothers, my father finding it scandalous that I, at the age of 4, wore a bikini while running through the sprinklers in my own backyard.  Stuff like that.

**That fucker did more harm than good in this world.  He was a firm believer of beating the shit out of your children, a fucker who - **

I remember more about my father than I would like to.  I remember him sauntering into the house to scream at us, to accuse my mother of whoring around and finally collapse, his breath stinking of beer and rum and dried vomit coating his shoes, while my eldest sister covered him with a blanket.  I dont like those memories.  Of course, this was before I even went to school.  I might be remembering all of this incorrectly.  I mean, I thought a man that looked like Triple H (the wrestler) lived under my bed.

**HE WAS THERE TO PROTECT YOU, YOU DUMB LITTLE BITCH!**

Anyway.  When I was 12 my mum married my stepdad, though theyve been doing the dirty since I was about six.  That was the year my mum and my father separated, but they didnt have a divorce until years after that.  My father moved away, my mum stuck around to raise me.  I just know that Pete Greer has made my living hell for eleven years.

**Understatement of the fucking year, Cornelia, fucking honestly?  That fat fuck motherfucking raped you, he motherfucking tortured you, he motherfucking broke your soul and you liken it to living hell?  There is something worse, Cornelia, and that would be what that fat fuck did to you!**

I call my stepdad daddy.  He is the one that raised me since I was six years old.  My real dad never wanted me.  He he told my mum that he would rather write me off as a daughter than to pay the monthly sum that my mum needed to look after me.  He gave me gifts, but it was a broken printer, a scratched CD and, once, a hand towel.  Honestly, what type of father was he?

**HE WAS BETTER THAN THE FAT FUCK.**

I soldiered on.  I didnt have a lot of friends, but I had Carinne.  Carinne was a few months younger than I was, but I liked her and hanging out with her.  We were inseparable.  At least we were inseparable for the first thirteen years of our lives, before we made new friends.  I know where she is now, but I dont talk to her.  I dont like her.  I didnt like who she changed into when we got to high school.   Then again, I dont like anyone.  Though I do a pretty good job of pretending I do.  People know me as the nice girl, the smart girl, the girl who is likely to end up a billionaire because she is just that fucking smart.  I have absolutely no modesty, nor do I have the patience to fake it.  This was what drove Carinne away.  I always did better than she did  tests, assignments, even the stupid fucking little baking soda volcano.  I was a genius, and my teachers loved me.  My friend?  Well, she was smart, but the fact that I didnt apologize for my good marks deterred her.  She abandoned me as soon as we reached high school.  Not that I mind, I enjoyed solitude and the silence is wrought.

**I... well, she makes a good point.  I'm only here because I can't fucking escape from this damn body.  I don't want to be her friend either.**

Of course, I still excelled at everything I did.  I was a genius, after all.  I was an alto in choir  the only alto, mind you.  I ended up on the first hockey team in the second semester of my fourteenth year, mostly due to my vicious attacks that had the other team hurrying away from me.  I once slammed the hockey ball into a girls forehead, and there was a sizable dent in her skull after that.  The enemies stayed clear of me.  I once managed to get a goal from the other side of the field where I was guarding the goalie, solely because the team was terrified of me.  

After the game, I put on my ditzy smile and apologized to the girl.  She shook my hand, though she was shaking.

Mostly people thought I was innocent.  I mean, Im the girl with the perfect grades, the perfect personality, I did sports and choir, I participated as much as I could.  I was the innocent, if somewhat egotistic, girl.  Witty, funny, pretty, smart, athletic, artsy  Perfect.

Only it wasnt just Cornelia at that time.  By that time, Lee had been born  quiet, bookish, shy.  She went to school for me.  She did all the studying and wrote the tests and exams too.  She was a little ball of nerves all the bloody fucking time.  Cornelius managed to calm her down, though.  Cornelius was the silent, strong one.  They called him the protector.  He always came out when it was play time with daddy.  He didnt say a word, he took the punishment.

And we were fine for a while.  Lee took care of books and studies, I took care of sports and the artsy things, and Cornelius protected us.  I was innocent. 

But Im not innocent.  People like to think I am.  Im a pretty girl and I come across as childish to many people.  Of course I do  thats the faade Ive created.  Im an innocent little girl, at 23.  Dont get me wrong, I do love Disney, and I do love dolls and stuffed animals.  I love Barbie and My Little Pony.

Carinne tried to reach out again after school, but by then I was arrogant and dismissive of absolutely everyone.  Okay, Leah was all that.  She took the wheel, because I was tired.

The crux is that I was Cornelia until I hit twelve.  By that point it had been happening for three years, and I just couldnt take it anymore.  Cornelius couldnt take it anymore.  Of course he couldnt, he was a twelve-year old boy.  And that was when Lia came to the fore.  Lia was an old lady, very wise.  Shes the one that finally helped me to make friends.  Okay, made the body make friends.  Lia was close with a tall girl with flaming red hair, Monica.  Lee met a boy called Marcus, equally shy, equally awkward to her.  Me?  Cornelius and I ended up hanging out more often.  I let the others take the wheel, because I was just tired.

When boys came into the picture I ran like hell.  I hid in the recesses of my mind, hiding from anyone who tried to touch me.  Could you blame me?  Twelve and already severely mentally scarred.  Fucked every other night by the man I considered to be my father, but he just showed how much of a father he wasnt.  He stole my body from me when I was twelve.  He forced his cock into my tiny body, and no matter how much I protested and begged, he didnt stop.  He did it thrice a week in the beginning.

**I'm sorry.  I'm fucking sorry.  What do you want me to do, Cornelia?  I'll do anything to keep you... to keep us safe.  You are my sole reason for existing.  I didn't mean it.  I didn't mean it when I said I didn't want to be your friend.**

At fifteen I was broken.  My father hated me, because I now refused to have contact with him.  I refused to let anyone know just how broken I was.  If anyone got too close, hey had to go.  Monica left.  Carinne left.  Marcus tried to stay.  He really did.  He could get Lee out of her shell, which even I couldnt do.  

**Lee's a sweet kid.  A little high-strung, but sweet.**

When I was sixteen, it was my sisters husband.  A large man  in his forties, massive, his stomach protruding from his body like a balloon.  A disgusting man.  

**Cornelia hates this story.  She isn't strong enough to tell it.  But I am.  That time I, she, would have gone on vacation with my, her, sister and her husband.  Some sisterly bonding time, you know?  Only the fat bastard fucked that up one night by making his advances known.  I, she, screamed and ran.  I, she, ran out of that house, out of that damn fucking city.  They found me... her... us... days later, hiding out in a gas station bathroom.  My, her, mother was the one to find me, and I told her everything.  She believed me.  She wasnt even angry that Id, that we'd, run away.  But I couldnt retaliate.  I couldnt press charges.  I couldnt even talk about it.  Mum said so.   Or Cornelia couldn't retaliate.  She was just a fucking kid and... and this happened?  What did the poor girl ever do to deserve his?**

First daddy, then my brother-in-law.  My sister hadnt spoken to me for years after that, and I honestly resented her.  

This new event didnt deter daddy from sneaking into my room at night.  He choked me, his hands tightening around my neck, and he came inside me.  Multiple times.  And

**I'M SORRY.  I'M SO SO SORRY.  I WISH I HAD BEEN THERE!  I WOULD... WOULD HAVE CUT OFF HIS DICK AND SHOVED IT UP HIS ASS.  I WOULD HAVE KILLED, CORNELIA.  FOR YOU.**

I couldnt tell anyone, could I?  It wasnt one of those scandalous things anymore, but no one would have believed me.  I tried to tell people about it.  The guidance counselor, my teacher

That had been weird.  I, Cornelia, was at the front trying to talk to Mr Ludz about my life.  For the first time since my head was so full of voices, I blacked out.  I knew that people who had these voices in their heads often blacked out, unable to remember where they were or what they did.  But I was aware of everyone.  Lee, Lia, Cornelius.  I knew them all.  I knew us all.  I knew who we were and who was at the front.  Usually Lee, but Lia whenever someone tried to get close to me.

I woke up in bed.  My last memory had been standing in front of Mr Ludz, nervous, about to tell him everything.  I liked Mr Ludz, he was one of the kindest teachers Id ever met.  

The next morning, we walked into his class.  He usually waited for us outside, but this time he didnt.  I was the first to class, the first in the doorway I was the first on the grass too, emptying the contents of my stomach.  I screamed, I knew I did.  For once I was at the front, and now I regretted it.  Someone else should have been at the front.

Mr Ludz sat on his chair  or rather, slumped in his chair.  He was dead.  That much was obvious, because there was a deep gash in his neck, and his pristine white checked shirt was covered in blood.  Blood that had flowed from his neck, down his clothes and dripping on the floor.  I felt euphoric when I first saw it.  Nostalgic, and then nausea washed over my body.  His trousers were open, his brown pants stained with blood.  His dick lay on the floor beside his body.

An investigation was launched.  It was found that Mr Ludz had been handsy with the teenage girls, and threatened them continuously.  It was never found out who killed him, but nobody was sad to see him go after finding out he was a serial rapist.

I was... well, I was broken.  My mind was broken.  If only rape had been all that they'd done to me, I would have been fine.  I would have... I would...

**You would be dead.**

<TEXT> The court case came quickly.  I had a court appointed lawyer but he was basically useless.  He tried to make me tell him what I did, but I didnt do anything, so there was nothing to confess to.  They soon called Leah to the witness stand.  She was smiling  her usual loving smile.  I dont think I was the only one that was even a little bit unnerved.

Miss Greer - The DA, Magda Niem, said.  The district attorney was building a case against me.  Her star witness?  Leah King, the little bitch that put me here.

King.  Im not his daughter. Leah said coldly.  She gave me a look that told me she wished I was dead, or worse.

All right, Miss King, Niem said, irately, Why did you insist on being a witness?

Because I know what hes going to say to prove his supposed innocence, Said Leah, and she had her smile on again.  It was a smile that said she was going to devour me alive, And Im honestly happy hes behind bars.  He has made my life a living fucking hell for the last ten years.  Sorry for the language.

Thats bullshit and you know it! I shot back.  Niem raised an eyebrow, as did Leah, though the expressions differed.  Niem looked slightly curious, while Leah looked somewhat amused.

Mr Greer, be quiet, or I will hold you in contempt. The judge said, bored.  I bowed my head.  O hadnt been granted bail at the bail hearing  go figure. Even if I did get bail, who would pay it?  My wife was nigh comatose and mu daughter hated me.

Hes well, hes been an abusive fu - fella for a while. She caught her swear word, Hes been hitting me and my mother, and I thought it was weird when Spot died.  Daddy always seemed to love Spot more than anything  than me or mum  and, I dunno, hes been annoyed with her lately.  And then he killed her and he said it was me.

What do you mean exactly by abusive?  Niem asked.  I raised an eyebrow.  I wanted to know too.  Leah held out her wrists.

Daddy grabbed my wrists when he was mad at me.  Once my wrist broke, and he just laughed at me.  I didnt even get to go to the doctor until the next day.

That that had happened, but it was an accident!  She was eighteen at the time, and we were playing.  No, not the kind of playing your thinking about  playing tag with her niece and nephew.  And of course I played too.  I managed to tag Leah, but I got hold of her wrist and it broke.

Is there evidence of this? The judge asked.  The DA nodded.

Yes, sir.  There are eyewitness accounts and x-rays of Miss Kings broken hand after the incident.  I also asked her to get a recent x-ray, which has been examined by a professional, who agrees that the wrist was broken approximately five years ago.  Niem said it all very smoothly.  My attorney let his head fall onto his arms.  He didnt like this case.

Nor did I.

Where was my wife?

Why was Leah doing this?

I did not deserve this!

The x-rays were handed over and examined by the doctor in the court.  He confirmed it.  

Is that all, Miss King? The judge asked. 

For now. Leah said, and she was allowed to return to her seat.

. . .

Life was well, life was weird.  The judge ended up giving me a fine and community service.  He said that my daughter vouched for me, taking back her claims of abuse.  The jury didnt understand why it was happening.  The lawyers didnt understand.  

I had to go back to court for the charge of murder against my wife, but I was granted bail, a surprisingly low amount, and told to be back in a month.  Meanwhile I was not allowed to contact my wife, or I would be back in jail.  I was under investigation, but my life was thrown on its head.

I had to go to my house.  My big empty house, that I had worked for all of my life.  A house that I had bought with my wife after she and I had fought our way through years of embarrassment and prejudice to buy.

And it was empty.  Leahs laughter wasnt there, nor was the sound of the TV shows she always watched.  Mary and the sound of her shuffling feet wasnt there, her laughter, her strange sense of humour wasnt there

Spot wasnt there to cuddle me  she was killed.  Boy was nowhere to be seen.  Probably taken by Leah, probably killed by her too.

Why did they let me go?  Why was I not in jail after all the footage I saw?  Why wasnt I being raped in the ass by some fucker in a prison cell?  I wouldve put myself there if I was the judge.  I wouldve thrown away the key.

More importantly  why was Leah so strange?  She kept changing her mind.  

Daddy, Her voice said, a sing-song voice  her playful voice.  I looked around, she was there, in the doorway.

Leah. I said, keeping my voice level.  She came closer, wearing a pair of jeans and a tight shirt that really left nothing to the imagination.

Stop it. She said sharply, and I pulled my eyes away from her chest.  Hatred burned in her eyes.

Why are you here?

Oh, I just came to tell you how I did it. She smiled, sitting down opposite me.  Youre going to jail, daddy.

But you took your claims back?  I said, confused.  She pursed her lips thoughtfully. 

Thats doesnt mean a fucking thing. She said.  They let you go to see what you would do.  And on this night, daddy, you attacked me.

Leah, I would never-

Never? She said, lifting an eyebrow.  She showed her phone to me, a video was playing on it.  It was an intimate scene, with me pounding into her.  She was tied up, blindfolded

This didnt happen!  I said, and she smiled again, putting her phone in her pocket.  

I know. She said softly, Just like you didnt kill Spot.  Just like you didnt poison mum.  Just like I wasnt here, but yet I was.

Leah, what are you?

You fucking hate the fact that I am such a smart bitch, dont you?  I know you do.  But you never thought I was smart enough to do anything about you and our playtime.  I couldnt anything at the time.  Now?  Oh, now I can do so much more.  Im a motherfucking genius, daddy.  Im going to get away with everything. With killing mum, with Spot, with getting everything you own.

Your mum isnt dead, she is-

She died an hour ago. Leah interrupted me.  The way she said it made me shiver.  She said it coldly, and she looked me in the eyes while she said it.   Better yet, you killed her.

I did not!

No shit, She laughed, But the video shows otherwise.

She didnt show me the video this time.

Why? I asked, my heart breaking, Why your mother?

She let it happen. Leah shrugged, And she just let it go on.  For years.  For ten fucking years, daddy, and she never stopped it.  She never even tried!  But now She laughed again, rather evilly, Now I can do whatever I want.  And you get to go to jail, knowing my mother thought that you killed her.

She got up.  I tried to stand too, but I couldnt.

I drugged you again, just like last time.  You really should know better than the Coke, dad.  She giggled. And how did I do it? She tapped on her phone, and an exact replica of her appeared next to her.  Meet Leah 2.

It was it was a hologram.

And Peter 2.  She conjured another me too.  I saw myself for first time in a long time.  I was huge.  I had a beer belly, showing exactly why I needed to wear a four-extra-large pair of pants.

Youll be stuck for a few hours more.  Youll look awful, I guess, because youll have pissed yourself by then.  She walked to the doorway.  Goodbye, daddy.

I was fucked.

<TEXT> I understand why you are all mad at me.  I dont blame you.  But honestly, I dont think I deserved this.  I didnt deserve what Leah did.  


I dont think I did.


When the numbness finally wore off, I heaved my massive body from the chair and went to bed.  I didnt know what else to do.  I felt empty.  I felt as though my world had ended.  And little did I know that it did.

The police came knocking on my door.  Correction: they hammered against the door, and when I didnt answer, they broke it down.  There were no barks, there were no running feet telling me that my daughter was going to open the door or defend me.

Mr Greer!  Mr Greer!  They called, and I groggily stood up.  I trudged through the hallway, glaring at whoever had barged in.  I expected it to be Marys brother  it sounded like him  but two people in blue uniforms greeted me.  A man slapped handcuffs on me.  I was too groggy to answer or register what was going on.

Peter Joseph Greer, you are under arrest for the murder of your wife, Mrs Mary Greer.  You have the right to remain silent  They read me my rights and soon I was hauled into their car.
Soon I was sitting across two police officers.  One was a pudgy woman with bushy red hair, and the other was a tall, young man with glasses.  Neither of them looked like they would be able to run after a criminal if it was needed.  I wasnt one to judge, because there was no way that I would even make a run around the block.

Mr Greer, Said the woman, What can you tell us of your wife and her current condition?

I dont know, I said, I went to sleep, and when I woke up my wife wasnt in bed with me.  Wed had an argument the night before, and I found her in the guestroom.  She didnt wake up  that was when I called the ambulance.

And you assumed she committed suicide? The woman didnt sound convinced.

There was a partially empty pill bottle next to her.  Yes, I assumed she tried to commit suicide. I said, rolling my eyes childishly.

The tox screen said that it wasnt all that was in her system?  He went on to list every single thing shed had in her stomach.  Anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medicine, Coke, sleeping pills, and more, read from a document shed had on hand.

And, according to the doctors report, the medicine was yours.

Im not on anti-depressants, I said quickly.  The woman paused, glancing at me.

According to your doctor, you have been on these pills for almost four years.

I started.  It was possible, I just drank the pills that Mary gave me every morning and night.  

But how do you come by the idea that I tried to murder my wife?

She told us that. The woman said.

Shes awake?  Both relieved and startled.  I loved my wife, I did, and I didnt know why they wouldnt call me to tell me.  Unless, of course, I was made to be the murderer.

Debatably, and she claims she didnt take the pills.  She drank some Coke and went to bed.  The last thing she saw was you bending over her.  The man spoke this time.

SO now Im a murderer? I asked.

The video footage is pretty damning.  Said the woman.  I started again.  Video footage?  We we didnt have cameras in our house.  Well, not security cameras.

They continued to question to me about it.  Spots death came up, my spying on Leahs internet use came up  I didnt know what I did was called spying.  I thought I was just checking up on my kid!

Sir, you installed a trojan on her computer.  Everything she did was sent to you. The man said.  I didnt bother to remember their names. 

I stuttered.  What was a trojan?

And, according to your daughter, this isnt the first act of violence against her mother.

Of course, Leah was in this too.  There was no way she wouldnt be involved in this.  This was all her doing.  That conniving little bitch!  So, this was what she meant when she said it wasnt over.

I didnt respond.  The two officers soon realised that I wasnt going to speak, and put me in a cell.  I had one call, and they advised me to call a lawyer.

I didnt call anyone.  Maybe later.  I was trying to figure out what was going on.  Yes, I did do things to my stepdaughter that could be considered immoral, but I didnt try to kill my wife.  I dont know why Mary would think that.  It wasnt as if she had tried to stop the thing with Leah.

These things apparently travelled through families.  My mother did it to me.  Marys father did it to her.  I did it to Leah  and she was probably going to do it with her children.  I didnt know anything about her fathers side of the family, but I heard her fathers brother was a bastard.

I didnt understand any of this.  What was going on?

. . .

New footage came to light.  I saw it this time.  I saw myself stand over Mary, forcing pills down her throat as she slept.  She didnt try to fight back.  Her eyes were open, though, and terror was evident on her face.  She must have been paralysed, like I was.

Next the camera was outside my house.  I was kicking my dog, kicking her mercilessly, and I could see her yowling.  I kicked her until she couldnt get up.  And then I took out a knife.  I slid it across her throat, and my dog died.

Next the camera showed me running into the house.  An hour later I came out again  I was wearing the same clothes as Id done when I supposedly killed Spot.  The video showed me shake my stepdaughter, yelling at her, and I saw her wrestle an arm loose and she punched me in the face.  I fell down, out cold.

The footage showed me do all those horrible things.  But I hadnt tried to murder my wife, and I didnt kill my dog.  Why would I?

What was going on?

<TEXT> Mary was now in the hospital  she was going to be fine.  Her stomach had been pumped and the doctors had managed to stabilise her.  But hours later the doctor shared with me that the sleeping pills were not the only drugs in her system.

They found a plethora of anti-depressants, anti-anxiety pills and pain killers in her system.

How do you think this happened? The doctor asked.  I shrugged my shoulders, because I honestly had no idea.  Mary wasnt on any anti-anxiety medicine, nor was she on anti-depressants.  The only medicine we had at our home was my diabetes medicine and high-blood pressure medicine, and Marys heart medicine.  A year or so ago shed had heart failure.

The doctor seemingly accepted this and advised me to go home.  I didnt want to go home  I was going insane, it seemed, my daughter arriving in front of me, speaking to me.  Was it my conscious?  

I had tortured her for years?  That was what Leahs voice had said, wasnt it?  But how was that possible?  How did that even work?  How How did I torture her?  I was a father for her when her own father wasnt.  I cared for her, I raised her as my own!  Who dried off her tears when that lowlife father of hers just left her for dead?  Who played with her when no one else would?

This was insane.  No one had asked me to give up my life to care for Leah. I just did it.  No questions asked.  I bought her first doll house, I brought her the first laptop she ever had  I even let them put that damn expensive software on it!

I allowed her to have a dog, I allowed her to continue living with us.  God knows shes an annoying little bitch at times, but shes my kid and I accept that.  I help her with her car, Im her fucking handyman!

Why did her voice say I tortured her?

Why?

I didnt understand.  I finally did go home.  Leah and Kira were gone, but so was Boy.  I didnt even worry about that  if the dog was dead, so fucking be it.  I didnt care anymore.  If I couldnt have Spot, then no one could have a pet.

I put on the TV and soon yelled for my daughter to fetch me a glass of water.  She always did it.  I called her from the flat to get me water  and other stuff  and she never complained.  Granted, it was much quicker for me to get up and do it myself, but I just always asked Leah.  That was what she was for.

I heaved my large body from the chair and made my way to the fridge.  There I found half a bottle of Coke, which I took just like that and carried it back to the living room.

Im not supposed to drink Coke, or alcohol, or anything that isnt water, or so the doctor said.  But I often gave in to a glass of icy Coke.  I took a swig  it was flat.  When was the last time we bought Coke?  It isnt something on our shopping list normally, but

I shook my head and took another swig.  I loved the feeling of my throat burning as the gas bubbles slid down my throat  the flat Coke was making the entire experience remarkably underwhelming.  I sighed when the bottle was empty and let it fall to the floor.

Suddenly I felt numb.  I couldnt move.  I figured I was tired and decided to take a nap right there.  Mary wasnt here to scold me, and Leah wasnt here to laugh at me.
. . .
Honey? A voice said, Honey, wake up.  I opened my eyes.  It was my mother.  She was pretty, but lonely.  My father worked long hours, and mommy missed him a lot.  

Mommy, what is it? I asked.  It was dark outside, and I could hear my brother snoring on the bed opposite me.   I tried to sit up, but she pushed me back into the pillow, a hand over my mouth.

Dont speak. She whispered, before she flipped the bed covers off me.  She pulled my boxers down, bowed her head and 

MOTHERFUCK! I screamed.  I looked around  relieved that I was an adult, I wasnt a scared fifteen-year-old, I was home.  But I couldnt move.  My body was frozen, I could only move my eyes.

I was alone.

My damn mothers so-called playtime.  I never knew it was wrong.  I never knew that parents werent supposed to do that to their children.  I didnt know that it was taboo, or that it was something called incest, or

My mother had taught me that it was playtime.  She did that until the day I left for the army.  It was a different time  no one spoke about things like that.  Sure, we discussed sex, but not sex with our mothers.  We would even sit in a ring and jerk off when we were bored.  We discussed the act of sex, but never who we did it with.  

We didnt talk about the nightly moans we found the guys making, where theyd cut holes in their mattresses and humped the hell out of it.  Or when they humped each other, as it were.  It was the army, and what happened there, stayed there.

I didnt know it was wrong.

Not until Mary told me that she had been raped by her own father as a child.  Not until she told me that if there wasnt a loud yes, then it wasnt consensual, then it was rape.  I didnt know

And I didnt know it was wrong when I did it to Leah.

Caught on, have you? Leah said, and I jumped  or if I would have had I not been paralysed.  I tried to speak, but she put a hand in the air.  Dont bother, you cant talk.

She stood up and walked to me.  She put a hand on my arm  and she felt real. Daddy dearest, She said, How does it feel to be at the receiving end?

I was at the fucking receiving end for fifteen fucking years!

I know all about what ol auntie Iris did to you, Iris was my mothers name, and she just refused to acknowledge her as her grandmother.  She didnt have a problem with my father, she gleefully called him granpa, but she had always seemed to hate my mother. Mum told me.  Just after I told you to stop.

I remember that day.  I had been offended that she didnt like our playtime.  I even posted on social media about it, but that opened a whole other can of worms.

But the thing is, dad, She sat across from me, You have been such an enormous asshole to me.  Youre such a motherfucking hypocrite, you know that?  Im not allowed to drink  but you drank as if there was no tomorrow.  Im forbidden from smoking, but you lived on two packets a day.  I am not allowed to have friends, but you had tons.  And you call me when Im busy fucking studying because you cannot get off your sexist, lazy ass to make yourself a cup of coffee.

She smiled.  That sick, twisted smile that made the hair on my neck stand up.

Im tired of being your slave.  So, this is where I leave you.

She stood, and left me in the dark.   "But it isn't over." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Leah did this weird thing today  she made lunch.  Thats twice in one week now, and I really think she might be poisoning me.  Stronger coffee, saltier quiche  fuck, I didnt know anything about poison, and I didnt know what it tasted like either!  

She makes these sandwiches where she toasts the bread, and then on the bread?  Cold slices, bacon, avocado, feta cheese, mozzarella, pickles, cucumbers  The whole thing was supposed to make me feel better after my pitbull died.  Mary didnt say anything about Spot, and I ended up burying Spot in the backyard.  My dogs throat had been slit  her white fur was matted around her neck.  I heaved when I picked her stiff body up, my heart broke.

Mary is talking to me again.  The fact that I had accused Leah of animal murder was a bit much.  But but I didnt know anymore.  Leah kept appearing out of nowhere.  The first night in the hallway, last night outside.  And she wasnt even wearing the same clothes!

What whats happening to me?  I was told not eat Leahs food, and I didnt.  But good lord, how that turned out!

Daddy always does this! Leah sobbed in the kitchen to her mother. I cant get angry when he makes his stupid, fucking jokes!  I am not allowed to get angry!

Honey, calm down, maybe hes just not in the mood Mary tried, she always tried to keep the peace between Mary and me.

Well I dont care! Leah screamed, and I felt her glare on me.  She stalked to me, and the image I saw was identical to the one Id seen when shed told me that she hated her father. YOU!  You get mad at every little thing.  You get mad at me putting a towel on the door handle, because you think that I think you are a fucking pervert.  And now you refuse to eat my food?

Tears were glinting in her eyes.  

You know what?  I am DONE.  I wont protect your precious little feelings anymore.  Im leaving.

Where will you go? Mary demanded, suddenly furious, What will you do?

Anywhere is better than here.

She stormed out.  Not long after I heard her car start and she left.  Mary looked at me, her eyes closed in frustration.

Why didnt you just eat the food? She sighed and left me alone.  I sat there  I had no idea what to do.

I followed Mary to our bedroom. Why are you blaming me for this?

Are you serious right now? Mary barked at me, I know Spots death is sad.  But why did you say Leah did it?  Why did you say shes acting strange?  And why did you refuse to eat the food?

I had no answers.  Instead I just lied down on the bed and closed my eyes.  What else could I do?

I dreamt.  That was what I did.  It wasnt just a normal dream  it was a dream of my stepdaughter, Leah.

The dream was full of sweat, screams and begging.  

Please, daddy, Leah begged when I was shaking her again, Daddy, daddy, daddy stop!  

I didnt stop.  I just kept shaking her.  Her head fell off, a bloody neck all remaining.  Her arms were shaken off too, and then she fell apart, piece by piece until all I was holding was two upper arms.  Then it wasnt her arms anymore, but it was Spots head.

I jerked awake.  It was dark.  Id probably slept through the day.  I rolled around, expecting to see Mary.  She wasnt there.  Neither was Boy.

Youre all alone. A voice said softly.  I nearly pissed myself. Sucks, doesnt it?  I recognized the voice as Leahs, but it was her angry voice.  Calm, collected  and terrifying. 

Why are you doing this to me? I demanded into the darkness. 

What am I doing?

Torturing me. It was the only word I could find to describe what she, or it, was doing to me. 

Im simply returning the favour, daddy, Her voice was sweet as she said this, You tortured me for years.  Since I was ten  you tortured me daily.  And I didnt know it was wrong.  And I didnt know how much how much you hurt me.  Until now.

Her voice took a turn for the dark as this was uttered.  I swallowed thickly.  What was going on with my daughter?

And, daddy, The voice came again, Wheres mummy?

I bolted upright.  I switched on the light and looked around.  Leah wasnt there.

Oh, you wont find me, daddy.  Her disembodied voice said. Now  go find mummy.  Times ticking.

I surged upright, my heavy stomach protesting at the sudden movement, and I walked as fast as I could on gout-ridden feet through the house.

Mary?  I started softly.  When she didnt answer, I panicked. MARY!

She wasnt in the guest room just outside our bedroom.  She wasnt in Leahs old bedroom.  She wasnt in the living room, kitchen or crafts room.  My heart pounded loudly in my ears, and I heard nothing.  All I was aware of was the loud thump, thump, thump of my heart that overrode all of my senses.

I bolted into the other guest room, the one that we didnt use except when Leahs elder brother came to visit, and I found her.

I sighed in relief.

Mary, you wont believe what I-

But she didnt move when I turned the light on.  She was lying on her stomach  and Mary hated sleeping on her stomach.  Boy was licking her face, small yowls escaping his mouth.  I rolled her over on her back and put my ear next to her mouth.  She was breathing, but only just.  On the bedside table stood a bottle of half-emptied pills.  I swiped the bottle and looked at it.  Sleeping pills.

I called an ambulance.  I tried to get a hold of Leah too.  She didnt answer.  I called from her mothers phone in the hopes that her mother would get her to pick up, but it didnt help either.  Finally I called Joe  Leahs boyfriend  and he answered.

Hello?

Joe, yes, Im looking for Leah.

Oh, its you. Joe said icily.  What do you want?

Its Mary, shes going to the hospital.

Mumll be fine. I heard Leah growl into the phone before she ended the call.  Was she honestly so angry with me that she would ignore her own mothers attempted suicide?

<TEXT> Today Leah was well, she was her loving self.  She made dinner for us  a spinach and cheese quiche.  Leah doesnt cook normally, not for us anyways.  Im talking about once every two months.
In her defence, she doesnt really have time to cook for us.  Its because she works late.  Or so she says.  I dont know what shes doing.

Leahs acting normally. I told Mary.  Mary glanced at me.

Why, didnt you expect her to?  Mary frowned, She didnt seem to be mad about something.  Shes just worried about finishing her assignment.

I nodded, but didnt say more.  Leah was always studying.  She was always writing an essay, doing an assignment, or doing something.  But she was always busy.  

I checked her internet history before I put my phone away.  I blinked rapidly.  

Home-made bleach
How to bleach hair
How to break my own wrist

What what was she doing?  What on earth was she thinking?  I wanted to tell Mary, but then I would have to admit that I was looking at Leahs internet history.  Wed always given Leah freedom on what she could watch and do.  That probably wasnt a good idea, because she developed a freakish obsession with horror films and serial killers.

Serial killers!  Shed been binge watching Dexter again!

I put my phone down just as Mary glanced over.  I didnt want to explain.  It would make things awkward.

Just go to sleep, honey. She said. Hey, wheres Spotty?

We had three dogs.  Kira  Leahs dog, Spotty  my dog, a large pitbull, and Boy, Marys miniature chihuahua.   Boy was lying wrapped around Marys ankle, sound asleep.  Usually Spotty lay at the side of the bed, and in the middle of the night she would get onto the bed and wrap her flabby body around my head.

But when I glanced down, Spotty wasnt there.  

Did we lock her outside? I asked, getting up and pulling on a pair of pants, Im gonna go check.

I walked outside.  Boy lifted his head, curious, but then laid it down again when he realized that Mary wasnt getting up.
Outside I called my dogs name.  After about three minutes, Leah came out of the flat.  Her hair was messy, and she was rubbing her eyes tiredly. She wore a pair of short shorts and a tight shirt  well, she left nothing to the imagination!  

Dad, whatre you doing? She said grumpily.  At her heels followed her small dog, its eyes curiously on me.

I cant find Spot. I said, and she smiled at me again.  

You cant find Spot, daddy? She asked sweetly.  I shivered.  Her smile spread around her lips again, the same smile that I saw on her last night.  You cant find your little darling?  Your little fucking darling?

Leah, this is

Your dog is DEAD. She deadpanned.  She took another step closer, her eyes boring into mine.  Your dog is DEAD, daddy.

No I started, because Spot was well, she was my best friend.

I killed her.  I broke her fucking neck.

No

Like Im going to listen to you saying no? Leah tilted her head to the side. Like you listened to me?

Honey?  Did you get her? Mary asked from the back door and I looked at her.  What are you doing?  Leave Kira and look for your dog!

I looked back at Leah, but she well, she wasnt there.  All that was left was the small dog.  I bent down and picked Kira up, but she didnt want to be in my arms.  She started to growl at me, and then she bit me!

Motherfu- I started, but Kira bit my hand again.  I dropped her, and she yowled.   She ran back to the flat  which was dark.  Leah was asleep, or she was gaming, but anyways she didnt hear it.  Kira almost fell over herself as she ran away from me.

Had I imagined Leah?

I strode to the flat and hammered on the door, screaming her name. Leah!  Leah, open up!

It took a few seconds before the door opened after her keys tingled as she unlocked the door.  Leah looked annoyed. WHAT?  Im slaying, dad!  Im gonna get play of the game and youre just fucking it up!

Leah had her wireless headphones on her head. Guys, one sec, okay? She said, and then she turned off her microphone. 

Were you just outside?

Seriously?  Daddy, Im slaying! She said, stomping her foot childishly.  What is it?  I looked down  she was wearing a pair of sweats and an oversized T-shirt.  It wasnt It wasnt what shed said just a minute ago.

Im looking for Spot. I said, ignoring the strangeness.  Maybe I was imagining things.

Oh, She said, turning the microphone back on.  I heard the sounds of gunshots and bombs being thrown. Guys, going AFK, give me a while. She took the headset off and set it on her laptop, where her avatar had died and had already respawned.

She walked next to me outside. Spot!

Spot!

Spot!

This went on for fifteen minutes.  

Leah looked in the street, Mary in the front yard and I looked in the back.  

And then I stumbled over her.  Over Spot.  The large dog was lying on the grass, and at first I was relieved.  Come, Spot!

But Spot didnt move.

Spot?

Spot was a happy dog, and she would wag her tail after she took a piss.  But she was lying still.

A light shone on Spot, courtesy of Mary  and I saw blood.  Spots throat had been slit.

LEAH! I yelled, WHAT DID YOU DO?

Leah came running.  She screamed when she saw Spot. Mom!  Mom!  Spot Mom, Spot.. And she started to sob.

I turned to her, took her by the shoulders and started to shake her. What did you do?  What did you do, you little bitch?

Daddy, please! Leah begged, sobbing harder.  I kept on shaking her small form, and she kept begging me to stop.

The next thing I knew was that my ankles were being bitten and I was looking up at my wife.

What?

You just told my daughter that she is an animal killer. Mary said icily. And she, understandably, knocked you out.  I know youre sad, but dont you ever do that again!

Mary looked at Spots body, before she picked up her own pup, the one nibbling at my ankles, and went inside.  Leah and Kira was gone.  The flat was alight now, but I heard the television.  Leah was glaring at me through the window.  I just knew it.

<TEXT> About two weeks ago my daughter started to act strangely.  When I say strangely, its important to note that my daughter is a strange person:  She is a 23-year-old woman with an obsession in Disney movies and dolls, and with the colour black.  I know she has some interests in weird things, but this is now becoming too much.

Leah isnt my daughter, shes my stepdaughter, but I consider her my daughter because Im the one that raised her.  Her father threw her away.  His words? Id rather not see her ever again than pay the alimony.

It crushed her.  She hated him after that.  It was the first time I saw such a dark emotion rise up in her, it was the first time I saw her cry in anger, and the first time she said that she hated someone out loud.  
My daughter still lives with me and my wife (her mother).  We have a little flat outside our house where she and her pup, Kira, live.  So she is on her own, she even pays us rent.  My wife and I still rely on her a lot, because Im 58 and my wife is turning 62 this year.  

We call on her for coffee when we wake up midday after our afternoon siesta, we ask her to bathe the dogs, and she does it with a smile.

But lately her smile isnt as sincere as it used to be.  Or maybe it hasnt been sincere in a while, I dont know.  She keeps giving me these looks.  Like shes planning something evil.

I know she loves horror films and books.  I know she paints her nails black and pretend shes such a hard-ass, but shes just a scared little girl.  Shes still playing with dolls, for crying out loud!

The coffee shes been bringing us is tasting a bit stronger.  At least to me; my wife didnt notice anything when I asked.  My daughters been going along with the jokes I make, as though they arent that much of an issue.  She usually got angry at them, but now she just she smiles at my jokes.
Im not a funny man.  My wife keeps reminding me of this. 

My daughter well, she hasnt been herself in ages.  Shes been busy.  I always see her on the laptop, and I just assumed that she was bus with assignments.  But then I looked closer.  I saw.  I screamed.
Her laptop was open on a sort of poison.  She heard me and arrived in her doorway.  Her eyes flicked to the screen and then to me.  A haunting smile crossed her face.

What is it, daddy? She asked in a voice that I shudder to remember.

What is this? I asked, pointing at her laptops screen.

Oh, daddy, its for my History class.  What types of poison was used on the ships during the slave trade.  She smiled innocently, and sat down a coffee mug next to her laptop.  Honestly, if I was planning on killing anyone, I would be less obvious about.
I laughed nervously and retreated.  This was my baby girl, and I knew for a fact that she didnt have history this semester.  

Or did she?

I can never remember.  Sometimes she speaks to me, but I dont hear it.  I usually just nod along.  Leah is very smart  scarily smart  and she knows it.  So, I dont listen to her gloating, because it messes with my head.  It gets annoying after a while, so I just block it out.

Dont get me wrong: Leah is a wonderful, sweet girl.  Shes smart as hell, but she isnt humble about it.  Shes much smarter than I ever was at school, thats for sure.  But I looked after her, I looked at her history on the internet, and this is the first time shes looked up poison.  Maybe I was wrong.  Maybe I wasnt.

She hasnt been home lately either.  I know she works  shes an au pair to a pair of rich folks with one kid who cant be bothered to look after him  and she stays late.  I dont mean until 7pm, I mean until 1am.  I dont know what she does there.  The kid is 10 and his parents are ALWAYS home, they just dont have time for him.

So where does she go?  

I shrugged it all off.  I thought I was imagining things.  Maybe she really did have an essay due on poison, maybe her employers had parties or functions to go to

Then why was she standing in the hallway when I went to take a piss?  Why was she smiling that sick, twisted smile again?  

Why was she coming towards me?

Hi, daddy. She said, and her voice was haunting.

Leah? I asked.  It was the middle of the night and I was spooked as fuck.  Why arent you in the flat?
She didnt answer.  She just kept looking at me.  Her smile stretched nearly around her face.  It wasnt her usual sweet smile, but a smile that reminded me of a clown.  An evil clown.

STOP! I screamed, Stop it, Leah!

Or what, daddy? She giggled, her smile not becoming any smaller.  I looked at the bedroom.  Maybe my wife was awake.  I screamed for Leah again to stop, but she laughed loudly.

Fucking stupid daddy.  What will you do if I dont shut up?  Or stop?  What I just go on?  Would you like that?  Would you want that? Her voice good lord, her voice was made out of nightmares and darkness.  It cracked, she cackled.  And should I fucking listen, daddy?  Like you did?

LEAH!  I screamed at the top of my lungs.

Pete? My wifes muffled voice came.  I heard the bedsprings beneath her as she got up and walked to me. Why are you yelling, honey?

Its Leah! I screamed, Shes

Mary, my wife, switched the light on.  There was no Leah. She wasn't in the hallway and my wife now thought I was imagining things.

The next day I cornered her.

"What the hell was that last night, missy?" I demanded. She raised an eyebrow and smiled a skew smile.

"Did you find the wine or the weed?" She asked. She always said this when she was in trouble. We had raised her not to touch a drop of alcohol or anything addictive. It was forbidden.

Plus: the joke was getting old.

I moved closer to her and she held her ground. Usually she would back away, but now she just folded her arms.

"Seriously, dad, was my gaming too loud?" She asked next. "Because I was just having fun fucking with people online."

I dropped it. It must have been my imagination.
