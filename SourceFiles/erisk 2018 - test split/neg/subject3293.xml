Even though we were both on the fence about having a doula, now that we have ours I wouldn't change a thing! I am SO thankful for my doulas and I haven't even given birth yet. They are seriously amazing! This is your birth, follow your instincts and find a doula! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if my brother fully understands that I'm pregnant. He is not verbal at all, as he lost his speech about 5 years ago, so it's tough to know if he fully gets that he going to be an uncle. He loves babies though and I think when we bring the baby home he will be so excited and he'll get it! Unfortunately I live across the country but we do get to FaceTime, which helps a lot. Thanks for linking to the shirt, I was gonna ask where you got it! That's a great idea! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My brother has DS too and is 27 years old, and this will be his first time being an uncle! I love that you got him an uncle shirt! I'm going to do the same for my little brother. Maybe with the whole hospital thing, I would personally change my vocabulary when talking with him if he seems to be kinda fixated on the word "hospital" and associating it with bad times. Maybe instead say you are going to have the baby with a special doctor who goes to  school just to help mamas have their babies. And talk about that more than the physical place where it happens?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Diclegis really helped me out when I was puking on average 6 times a day and couldn't keep anything down. It also really helped to drink a protein drink/shake first thing in the morning before I even got out of bed. 

The protein is supposed to reduce nausea and it also keeps you full longer. Having an empty stomach makes the sickness so much worse. It's one of the ironic cruelties of morning sickness that it can spiral into more sickness as your stomach becomes progressively empty from puking.

Try to keep her entertained with books, movies, podcasts, anything to make the time pass. For most women, things get better after 12 weeks. Hang in there!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should have him look into holistic grazing. There are ways of raising animals which mimic the ecosystem functions of herbivores. Every ecosystem on earth is crucially dependent on animals. No creature on earth can live separate from this natural cycle. Also, "veganic" farming is a myth. Even conventional vegetable production happens at the expense of catastrophic ecosystem destruction ( loss of habitat for animals) in order to grow mono cultures of single crops. If you want to eat vegetables that are grown in healthy ecosystems, there will be animals involved, in a holistic fashion, i.e. Permaculture and organic small farms. </TEXT>

And I fire back "lol MIL, it's not even Halloween yet, but just so you know I'm planning on hosting Thanksgiving this year since it was obviously too stressful for you last year to deal with". 

So we had it at our tiny little apartment (sweet old landlady was out of town on business), and of course our dear family friends were invited. Luanne of course proceeds to show up two hours late, drink herself into a stupor and bitch about how our plates are "too small" and how she "just can't believe this is the new family tradition". Immediately after she finishes her food, she says "have fun cleaning up!" and orders doormat Dale to driver her home because she "doesn't feel well". 

Oh yeah, and all she brought to dinner was two bottles of wine, which she drank one of herself, and took the other home with her. Also, before I realized what was happening, she also took nearly all the leftover turkey and side dishes home, so we ended up with no leftovers, which is the best part. So she still ended up managing to fuck us over... Grrrr!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Lousy Luanne (almost) ruins Thanksgiving </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My inlaws moved across the country to be close to us (aka meddle with our lives) in October 2014. They had been living in a motel for the past month while searching for an apartment that lived up to Luanne's impossible standards, and ended up moving into their apartment just two weeks before Thanksgiving. 


Since no one else had offered by the time November rolled around, and my inlaws still didn't have a place yet, I had  planned to host Thanksgiving for the family (my husband, his two cousins, my inlaws, and some close friends). I invited everyone, then when my inlaws moved into their new place,  Lousy Luanne throws her weight and insists on changing the plans so she can host it herself at their apartment, where they haven't even unpacked and they don't even have a table to sit at. Since I was just getting to know them, I politely agreed and wanted to honor their family traditions and totally understood that Luanne would want to host her family. 

Lousy Luanne says family only, no family friends (who had been with us for all previous holidays)... So trying to honor her wishes, I uninvited our friends, which was horribly awkward! I insisted that Luanne make an exception for our landlady, who is actually a dear friend of ours and is elderly and always alone on the holidays, so she usually spends them with us! Luanne is not happy about this inclusion for no apparent reason other than wanting to be in control of everything all the time. 

Fast forward three weeks to Thanksgiving morning. We are supposed to get together at 3 for dinner. Fucking Luanne calls my DH at 9am crying that she is "too stressed to host Thanksgiving after all" and cancels the dinner!!! Apparently one of the main reasons Luanne flaked was because she just "couldn't stand to have a stranger at a family dinner" (meaning our sweet old landlady)

Not knowing what else to do, my husband and I quickly try to get shit together to host at our place and luckily, our sweet old landlady (who lives next door and has a much bigger kitchen and house) saved the day by allowing us to have everyone over at her place instead at the last minute! So my DH and cousin drive over to get the turkey and  we all hustle our asses off to pull together a decent dinner. Since I was now hosting, I called our family friends and re-invited them over, explaining that MIL is apparently batshit insane!

So we manage to get dinner all ready by 4 somehow, and our amazing family friends bring over their dinner to join with ours, also totally saving the day!! We managed to have a feast prepared! And who decides not to show up until nearly 6? Goddamn Lousy Luanne and my poor FIL, doormat Dale. 

The whole dinner Luanne drinks and sulks and pouts about how she can't believe we are "having a new tradition now". Fuck you Luanne!!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> She is generally always saying something inappropriate, whether in restaurants or to whoever, but it's very often directed at me. My husband has tried to call her out on it and she says she is "just so nervous trying to please your wife" that she accidentally says mean things all the time. When we call her out on it in the moment she always says "I didn't mean it like that" or "I'm sorry you misunderstood me". I'm not falling for it though, if someone consistently treats me poorly, there's not much to misunderstand!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Introducing Lousy Luanne </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-07 07:50:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is my first time posting, but I've been visiting this sub for solace for months! I'll call my MIL "Lousy Luanne". DH and I have been married only a few years, but I have many stories to share about Luanne and her lousy behavior, which has only increased since she and my FIL moved across the country to be "closer to us", aka meddle with our lives constantly. I'll dub my FIL "Doormat Dale" for now, as he is the classic sweet guy but a total pushover who enables the hell out of Lousy Luanne. 

I'll get into some more stories later, but for now, I'll stick with some ultra light Luanne BS that occurred tonight. 

I am 13 weeks pregnant, which is relevant to the story. So DH and I go to dinner at Luanne and Dan's  tonight with DH's two cousins. We walk in and Lousy Luanne makes a big fuss over her niece and nephew and son, gives all a big hug, but does not hug me or even acknowledge me with a hello. Then she asks if anyone wants a drink (Luanne has already likely had several drinks before we arrived, her favorite lately being straight vodka). 

She says "I've got this kind of beer and then I have some apple juice for the party pooper" referring to me. She says it in a mean way, not as a joke, as she gestures towards me. My DH (who has been trying to stick up for me more) says "what is that supposed to mean mom?" And she tries to back peddle by saying "well, I didn't mean it like that, it's just that she's pregnant, so she's a party pooper". 

So apparently because I'm not drinking while I'm pregnant with her GRANDBABY, that makes me a party pooper. 

This alone wouldn't be so bad, it's just a small example of the lousy things Luanne says on the regular. More stories to follow!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds like we're in a similar position! I'm warming up to he name myself, but I agree it's a lot of name to grow into! I like Uly for the same reason, it's a very soft nickname to contrast the larger than life Ulysses. It's funny though because my husband thinks of Ulysses  as "whimsical", which I don't quite get at first impression.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> #1 Old Gatorade that had been used like an ashtray. Was dying of thirst then chugged my friends Gatorade, got cigs and nasty in my mouth, choked on cig butts. 

#2  as a kid, I had a deathly fear of earwigs. When I saw one heading toward me on the carpet I got the bright idea to use a piece of paper  to flick it away from me. The earwig promptly split in two, with one end left on the carpet and the other end flinging up into my wide open mouth. Horrible incident.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speaking as an organic farmer who raises birds free range on pasture, it makes me sad to think of birds confined to such a small space. The purpose of chicken tractors is to move them frequently so that the birds always have access to fresh greens. In contrast, I don't think bees appreciate their hives being moved regularly(despite the fact that commercial beekeepers have begun to move their hives, which stresses the bees).This is not a good idea. How about free range birds with a stationary hive? </TEXT>

*  *One Straw Revolution* and *Sowing Seeds in the Desert* both by Masanobu Fukuoka

* *Gaia's Garden* by Toby Hemenway

Also, it's okay if gardening isn't as much your thing as botany is! Just follow that spark and you'll find a place to contribute within the permaculture movement, whatever that means.

Find out what hardiness zone you live in and then you can get a better idea of what you'd like to grow. Start small and have success and happiness. What do you want to eat? Give it a try! Also, no need for miracle grow, have a compost pile instead! Or try lasagna gardening to build up soil without tilling.  </TEXT>

You're not alone.it's not uncommon to have at least one "ick" moment such as this when you're first starting to navigate the dating world and sexual experiences. Just remember that it's perfectly ok for you to be assertive and to let boys know what you're comfortable with. It's also totally ok to let your partners know what you want, and to value your own pleasure. If a guy isn't okay with that, then he's not worthy of you! Hang in there, this shall pass.

<TEXT> Asparagus patches takes 3 years before you can harvest, but then the plants lives for 20+ years. If you plan on being at your location for a long time,I would go mainly with perennials, as they come back year after year (versus annuals). Other perennials for zone 5: Jerusalem Artichoke and rhubarb. garlics and chives behave as perennials, as they come back each year.

Then, plant some fruit trees if you have the space! Apples would do great in zone 5! </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, I say go for it, but continue to be thoughtful, cos it'd be awesome to pull it off! Get heavy duty bike tires, they'll be better, I promise! And five chickens is probably too many for your particular set up, as there is stress in being kept in a tiny area with that many other birds. I'd say maybe 3 at the most would be more than enough for one person! Also maybe raise the chicken area into your sleeping area ever so slightly, to avoid the bottom of the chicken coop from dragging on the ground in rougher terrain. Also, chickens love sprouts, so you can feed them those too plus the bugs, great thinkin! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for checking in! My mom says he's had a few cards come in the mail and she says he's been smiling a lot when they arrive and he has taped them up on his bedroom wall. I know there's not always quick solutions when someone is feeling blue, but I think it has cheered him up a lot to be hearing from all these people! </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Here we are in 1990](http://imgur.com/RSZBWEO)

My brother Jared was always the happiest little boy. He loves singing and reading. His favorites are snoopy, clifford, and whinny the pooh. A few years back, my family began to notice a difference in Jared's behavior. He wanted to sleep all the time, started having bed wetting accidents and has significantly decreased his speech and interaction with others. He was diagnosed with depression by a specialist in the area where my parents live. Here's the thing: his symptoms started when my other brother and I moved out of state to go to college. And my parents say he only really smiles and talks when we call or when we visit. It breaks my heart and I know it's making my whole family sad for Jared.

My out-of-state brother and I have been sending Jared letters and little homemade gifts and we also make sure to do facetime (like skype) every week to help him put a face to our far away voices. 

Anyway.. I found this subreddit today and I thought maybe some of you might want to send him a letter/drawing in the mail. I set up an email address for him too(jaredrocks@zilladog.net). His reading is at a 2nd grade level, so he really likes videos and he loves music. He would love to get a video of you playing a song, or just saying hi to him. I know he's lonely, and I think a little love from ya'll might cheer him up. 

Thanks for sending love. It means the world to so many people.

<TEXT> Herpes can lie dormant for months before the anti-bodies show up in  a blood test. Unfortunately, unless you tested negative before sex with your new partner, there's really no way to pinpoint him as the one who exposed you.

Also, herpes outbreaks are more prone during periods of immunity weakness. The healthier you are, the less likely you'll have an outbreak. Lastly, herpes is only a skin condition, not much different from acne or eczema. The social stigma is far worse than herpes itself.

2.It is fair to say that a person may experience cognitive dissonance while they are acting out their own defense mechanisms. Cognitive dissonance means people are biased to think of their behavior as correct, despite it being destructive or irrational.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's never wise to generalize. There are sad strip clubs, and wonderful strip clubs. There are drug-addicted strippers and degree holding strippers. I think the only semi-fair generalization to make about strippers is that they most likely aren't trust-fund babies. They've probably worked their asses off their whole lives to pay their bills, just like anyone else who doesn't have it all handed to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wasn't intending to imply gender bias, I was merely replying within the context of his question. To clarify, let's say *person A* initiates a non-touching flirtatious interaction with *person b*, I think the initiator should make their interest known in a non-touching way. However, perhaps person B could reciprocate the flirting with a giggle and a light graze of the arm, or a very playful, casual touch. No touching first, invitation instead.  </TEXT>

It sounds like you have deliberately ostracized yourself. No one likes to be given guilt trips. No one likes to feel pressured or judged. No one like a street-corner evangelist trying to shove his own personal views down the throats of passing pedestrians.  Fuck proselytizing, dude. Walk the walk, and stop badgering people who'll probably ever change their minds now that they know you as an example of the "lifestyle", as you put it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> i am a pastor's kid. i could have had a special rate and my parent's paying tuition at some yuppy private christian schools. because i don't support organized religion as an atheist (even admittedly as an agnostic), I understand that funneling my parents money towards a christian school is a contradiction of my principles. You called yourself an *atheist* and perhaps you are quite simply unconcerned with the ramification and social consequences of organized religion and people being *mis*educated in college, then you should feel fine about being wishy-washy. I, however, have chosen to put myself through school, to stand on my principles. My folks (who i once was estranged from) have grown to be very proud of me for how hard I work. They even brag to their friends that their daughter knows how to take care of herself. This is in contrast to most people my age (probably you too) who haven't the *slightest* idea of how to support themselves. I work full time and take 16 credits. Suck it up, ya know?  </TEXT>

As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission as the law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. (I Corinthians 14:34-35) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a 22-year-old woman and I attend college full-time, dating boyfriend for 3 years. Because I also work full-time to support myself and pay for school, I am pretty busy and stretched thin. Often, at the end of my day, the last thing I want to do is bike (no car) 8 miles to his house. Because he wants to see me, he usually is the one to make that 8 mile trek. Basically, what I'm saying is that given you've only dated for 2 months, the gal's got a lot on her plate and i guarantee that there is truth in her statements about work and busy-ness. It might be more comfortable for her to be in her own environment when she wakes up, because it helps her be successful in her busy days, ie: having all the accessories of home to start her day etc.

tips: make her feel "at home" as much as possible at your place. Cook her dinner, make sure you have food around if she's hungry, toilet paper in stock, clean, comfortable etc. 

oh yeah, and no pressure, no guilt trips. you sound like you're doing well on this already, she's a lucky gal. 

longwinded, but I hope I could be of some help, given my own similar scenario. </TEXT>
