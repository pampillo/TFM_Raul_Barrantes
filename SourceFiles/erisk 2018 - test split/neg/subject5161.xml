<TEXT> Each night it gets worse. 

Night time is the favourite part of the day for me. The world is finally going to sleep, and all the stress and demand of this modern society shuts down for just a few hours. 
I feel like I can finally be at peace with myself and the world, even just for a few hours.

So this is the time when I feel calmest. As if I can finally shut my brain off for a little bit and let tomorrows worries be exactly that; tomorrows worries.

But lately it has been different. I keep having this overwhelming feeling of unease take over. 
No matter how hard I try, it will not go away. I cannot control it. Its as if it lives in the form of a black cloud that forced itself down my throat and I swallowed it whole.

12.30am every.single.night (well morning) without a doubt. I creeps upon me. 
And BAM! It hits me in the face. 

I can't breath. I can't move. I am paralysed for what feels like an eternity, but is really only 30 seconds at most. 

Fear. Absolute fear that something terrible is going to happen. 
Something so awful, I cannot even begin to describe. 

It all started when I started hearing noises at night. Nothing major. Nothing too threatening.
Just an occasional bang on the gate or side of the house. 
I generally would not worry as the dogs wouldn't bark, which means that they weren't alarmed by these noises so I would pass it off as the wind.

But then it started to get louder, more frightening. By this stage the dogs would be awoken by these noises also, and would growl and bark in a way that made me feel extremely uneasy. Frightened even.
They're only small dogs, but they can and will cause harm if they feel threatened.

It was now becoming more frequent. I felt that if I left my window open I would be left more vulnerable. It was as if someone was going to tear down my security screen, force open the window, and come inside. I do not know where this fear came from, but I was overwhelmed by it almost every night. 

I became too scared to leave my blinds open, even the slightest bit, incase someone did actually attempt anything. They would be able to see straight into my bedroom, and have a perfect sight of me in bed. 

I thought that this was the worst that could happen and eventually started telling myself I'd read too many creepypastas, and that it was all inside my head. 

But then the creaking in the roof started. It sounded as if someone was directly above me, and was about to fall straight through the roof, and land on top of me. 

The first night I heard it, I didn't sleep until 4am. I thought I was just going crazy. It was unlike any noise I had heard before, and I was certain it was not the house creaking or settling. It was too loud and heavy for any wildlife we have around the area and we also have no holes in our roof.

I was almost asleep after I talked myself into finally attempting to close my eyes. 
I remember thinking to myself 'finally I can get some sleep'. The second this thought went through my head, I heard it yet again.
I was terrified. 

This is now happening multiple times a night. The banging, the dogs growling and barking, the 'thing' inside the roof. The feeling as if someone is watching me outside my window....

And now I'm seeing things.

<TEXT> Loss is something I have always been accustomed too. I lost my parents at a young age, to a horrific tragedy. I lost my high school girlfriend in a fire. Every pet I have ever had, has either passed away from unknown circumstances, or ran away to never been seen again. I struggled for so long to understand why these things were happening to me, but one day I just stopped asking. I was sick of being the 24 year old guy asking 'why me'. I didn't want people to continue to feel sorry for me. 

So I moved away from my childhood town, away from all the family and friends that remained, and found myself in a strange city, 2,500 Kms from home. To start with, I was a little homesick, I won't lie, but I adjusted. It took me longer then expected to make friends, but eventually I did. I found myself a 9-5 office job, and a crappy little studio apartment, but I was happy. It was nice to not be the guy who lost everything for once, for no one around me knew my story. No one knew the pain and suffering I had endured, and it was wonderful. I even considered getting another cat. But things became eerily strange. 

I stopped hearing from my friends, which was strange as we would always meet at the trashy bar down the road for a few beers and some pool while watching the game every Friday. But they just stopped showing. I tried calling and texting each one of them multiple times, but sure enough, nothing. I attempted to find them and message them on Facebook, but it was as if they never existed. My work colleagues, who I was never close with, but was never hostile towards, started avoiding me. They would scatter when I entered the staff room, as if I was a bad smell their noses could not possibly withstand. I wondered, what I could have possibly done, to have yet again, lost everyone in my life. I kept going over the weeks leading up to the changes. Trying to figure out whether I had done something to have been the cause of the problem. But there was nothing. I could not remember anything. It was as if my memory had been erased and I had just awoken from a coma. But I knew my name, I knew all of my 'friends' names, I knew exactly where I worked and where I lived. 

I started to panic. Everyday, I tried to remember the day before, but I couldn't. I could only remember events from the current day. The only reason I know that any of this happened, is because thankfully, I kept a journal I would write in every night before bed. Corny, I know. Why would a 24 year old male who enjoys drinking beer and watching sports keep a journal. It was something I was accustomed to. I had kept a journal documenting every day since I was a child. Or so I could tell. It is a strange feeling, to know something, but not have the physical memory of it. I started to question whether anything that I thought I knew was actually true. I strained so hard just to visualise one memory, but I couldn't. It was impossible. As if someone had come along, and removed all physical memory from my brain. 

I quit my job. I was in no place to be working when I could no longer remember the day before. I didn't want to endanger myself or others. Thankfully I knew that I had enough savings in the bank to survive without working. My parents had left me a trust fund, and I had barley ever touched it. But then things started to get worse. I could no longer remember the hours before. It would be 12pm in the afternoon, and I could no longer remember waking up. I could no longer remember eating breakfast, or getting dressed. I was worried for my life. What had I been doing this whole time? I would try to make it to the doctors, but by the time I got there, I would somehow back away and go straight back home. The only reason I know this would happen is because I would write all this down. I knew I wouldn't remember the events of the day in a couple of hours, but I needed to somehow be able to tell myself what I was doing. I couldn't figure out why I never made it to the doctors. 

But the strangest part of this all, was the fact I was still functioning as a normal human being. How can one possibly remain in a normal lifestyle when they have no physical memory of the hours before hand, let alone their life? Although I knew everything I needed to know about myself, having no physical memory of this was starting to really confuse me. My sanity was deteriorating, as one can expect. Suddenly, one morning I awoke. It was as if I was okay again. But I wasn't. Memories of my life, of every single thing I had ever done started flooding in all at once. It was too much to handle. I slumped on the floor, tears rolling down my face. I held my head in my hands. The room had an unsettling feeling about it. Everything I thought I knew about myself was all a fabricated lie. The only event that was actually true was moving away from my hometown. Apart from that, it was all twisted lies I had somehow made myself believe.

I killed them all. Every last person that had ever gotten close to me.

<TEXT> I haven't personally known anyone myself, but my uncle is a prison guard in my state in Australia. Most of you would have heard of the Port Arthur Massacre in Tasmania, Australia, conducted by Martin Bryant. It was the reason Australia has ridiculously strict gun laws also. (which I think are excellent, sorry to you Americans but I don't think just anybody should be able to walk around with a gun.) He killed 35 people and injured 23 others.... some of these were parents... husband and wife.... children even..... My uncle met this sadistic son of a b***h and has claimed he has never met such an evil person in his whole entire time working at the prison..... He is so evil and unstable he has his own building and is locked in a padded room with a straight jacket. This event has changed Australian history forever, and living in the same state as someone who killed almost 40 people is pretty intimidating. if you look into it enough, you'll find the wiki leaks page with real footage of the aftermath which was used as a police training video..... although, beware, it is extremely graphic and NSFW.  </TEXT>
