<TEXT> Hi reddit,

My name is [Hector Zenil](http://www.hectorzenil.com/) and I am the head of the Algorithmic Nature Group, the group responsible for the Online Algorithmic Complexity Calculator, and the co-leader of the Information Dynamics Lab at the Karolinska Institute (the institution that awards the Nobel Prize together with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences). I was previously based at the University of Oxford (Senior Researcher and Faculty Member). My research focuses on connecting the worldparticularly molecular biology and cognitionto computation in a fundamental way.

We recently published a paper titled [Human behavioral complexity peaks at age 25](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005408 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=redditama-0510) in [PLOS Computational Biology]( http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/). The study shows how measures related to computation can better explain sophisticated cognitive abilities of the human mind, in particular related to the way in which people can make random choices. We found that at 25 years old people can best outsmart computer programs at generating randomness, something that had been difficult to quantify before with measures based on traditional statistics that did not take the algorithmic nature of the human mind. An animated video showing some of these results has been placed online [here](https://youtu.be/E-YjBE5qm7c).

I will be answering your questions at 1pm ET -- Ask Me Anything! Dont forget to follow me on Twitter [@HectorZenil](http://www.twitter.com/hectorzenil) and visit my [personal website](http://www.hectorzenil.com/). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Arslan: Interesting hypothesis. There is some evidence that nose width increase has led to a decrease in the volume of the maxillary sinuses (Source: Butaric 2015 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.23182/abstract). Whether this variation explains differences in risk of sinusities is unclear but worth pursuing! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Arslan: I don't think anyone has rigorously tested this but it is thought that people in warmer climates tend to be taller with longer limbs and people in colder climates tend to be stockier. The longer body and limbs tends to dissipate heat more effectively while the stockier bodies tend to keep heat in. This pattern is known as Allen's rule and is thought to be due to adaptation to temperature.

<TEXT> Arslan: This is an important question. There are two answers:

1. Studying human evolution and adaptation helps us understand how genetic disease arise, what genes are underlying their risk, and how the risk might be different for different people. This information could be helpful in narrowing down the cause of the symptoms of someone who walks into a clinic and perhaps even in treating them. 

2. Basic science is the raw material on which applied science, such as medicine progresses. Faraday used to perform 'magic tricks' with electricity before he knew that it would be essential to our way of living today.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Arslan: Humans don't have a lot of differences among groups even for traits such as skin pigmentation and facial shape, even though it 'seems' like there might be. Even the differences observed in these traits are an exception rather then the rule. They are likely different because they are exposed to the environment or are important for social interactions, both of which can be different in different geographic regions. Other traits are much less different between groups. So far there is not a lot of evidence supporting large differences in the brain among human groups.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mark: Penn State! Good question. Clearly we are reshapping our genetics with our environmental technologies, and have been for hundreds of thousands of years. Clothes probably helped bring about loss of fur for example (more efficient sweating was very likely made possible only on losing fur as well). Environmental and medical technologies should be expected to slow the rate of ecological selection as a force shaping our evolution.   </TEXT>

Suppose person A and person B lived up to the same age, but person A had way more kids who survived in future generations than person B. This would make person A more fit in the strict evolutionary sense, even though they both lived up to the same age

<TEXT> Mark: Thanks for your interest.
1) We don't have a clear way to compare sexual and ecological selection pressures. One reason we expect sexual selection has helped shape the nose, in addition to climate-driven ecological selection, is the high level of sex difference observed in nose traits. Sexual dimorphism is most easily explained as sexual selection.
2) Among the groups we studied, the South Asian and European populations were the most similar pair of similar to one another due mostly to a recent separation of the ancestral populations and migration (gene flow) since.
3) It would be very nice to study desert-adapted populations as well as cold-adapted and altitude-adapted groups. More to your question, I'd expect desert-adapted populations would be better served by noses that facilitate substantial convective humidification of inspired air.
4) I think these conclusions are pretty solid and the populations use represent a nice sample of human diversity. Clearly, there are many more human populations and these can and should be analyzed to better understand the forces shaping the nose as well as to help us identify the underlying genes affecting nose shape and how these genes have evolved.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Arslan: Human variation is continuous, which means we exist on a spectrum. Some have broad noses, some have narrow noses and some in between. We also observe the same trend on a genetic level. It is not possible to draw a line somewhere to separate people into disparate groups on any biological level just like there's no way to separate black and white on a grayscale.

<TEXT> Arslan: Some people have already answered this question in the replies. While there are some forces of evolution (e.g. selection), which can lead to predictable changes over time, many other forces, such as genetic drift which is quite powerful in humans, are very unpredictable. Depending on the relative strength of each of these, evolution can be quite unpredictable. Movement of people across the globe and genetic admixture makes this even more complicated.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mark: Good question. Admixed populations are what we call groups who show ancestry from populations that were separated until recent migration events brought them together again. These populations can be especially useful for studying the genetic and environmental factors that affect traits and disease risks that vary across the parental populations. A number of skin color genes have been identified using admixture mapping, the technical name for using this recent admixture to identify the location of genes affecting the population differences. We've only done one initial analysis of facial variation in admixed populations, which was also published in PLoS Genetics in 2014. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Arslan: First of all, great question. I understand what you mean but the term race is indeed complex and has little biological basis. It is helpful to use terms like genetic ancestry or simply ancestry. 

Yes, when performing this kind of study, taking into account the ancestry of the people under study is important. When looking at whether nose shape might have evolved because of climate-related selection pressures, we focused only on people whose ancestry was mostly from only one of the four populations: W. African, S. Asian, N. European, E. Asian. We did this because we wanted to restrict more signals of recent admixture (mixing of people with different ancestries), which can cloud older signals such as those of adaptation to climate. We determined the ancestry of individuals in our study based on their DNA sequence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,
 
My name is Arslan Zaidi and I am a postdoctoral scholar at Penn State University. My broad research interests revolve around studying the ultimate (evolutionary) and proximate (developmental) causes of human variation.
 
My name is Mark Shriver and I am a professor of Anthropology at Penn State University. I am interested in studying the evolution of complex traits such as skin pigmentation and facial shape in humans, and in identifying the genetic determinants of these complex phenotypes.
 
We recently published a paper titled [Investigating the Case of Human Nose Shape and Climate Adaptation]( http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006616 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=reddit-ama-0503) in the March issue of [PLOS Genetics](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics). We were broadly interested in how and why facial shape has evolved in humans in our recent history and wanted to focus on one long-standing hypothesis: that differences in nose shape in humans have evolved due to adaptation to climate. We found support for two things: i) nostril width and nose width seem to be evolving faster across populations than expected under genetic drift alone (read: due to divergent selection), and ii) these differences may be driven, at least partly, by local adaptation to temperature and humidity

<TEXT> Steph: Absolutely. First of all, I often say that art and science are being kept apart against their will. This is reinforced by common neuromyths like "Left Brain/Right Brain" suggesting that creativity/art and logic/science are somehow independent. Aside from this being completely false from an evidence-perspective, the popularity of this idea speaks to how our culture categorizes different ways of knowing - which is a problem. This is where the STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, *Art*, and Mathematics) movement is trying to make a difference. In my experience with March for Science, STEAM has been an important emphasis. We had science illustrators, art installations, musicians, filmmakers, etc. at the SF March. Essentially, artists showing up for science. Though it may be idealistic, I think we should be shooting for a world where scientists feel compelled to show up for a March for Art as well, and I think incorporating STEAM into our messaging is a good starting point. P.s. today happens to be "Science Creates" Day in our Week of Action! Check it out: www.marchforscience.com

As to your second point about the impact of stereotype threat on children's interest in STEM, I think there are a lot of moving parts. First of all, we have to change the messaging and break the stereotypes. Unfortunately, a lot of this comes from pop culture. We have to make sure the people we cast and the characters that children see representing scientists are diverse and representative of the full population. Additionally, there is a lot of research suggesting that women and underrepresented minorities tend to show early interest in science but then drop off. To me, this says we have work to do to ensure that science as an institution is welcoming and listening to people of all backgrounds who may currently feel excluded, unheard, or unsupported. Science, as an institution, reflects the biases of society, so we have to be intentional about doing better. Everyone benefits from a rich pool of diverse scientists at the wheel. 

Most of that is my personal take, but I will say I feel like the March for Science takes these ideas seriously. In SF we worked extremely hard to be proactive about the voices and partners we shared our platform with and how we were using our influence. A common misconception is that these are peripheral - even "distracting" - issues, but they're not. They're core to making science something that truly is for everyone. And, perhaps indirectly, that's really the goal. That's how we get everyone to support science: we work towards a science that is serving everyone. These issues can't be solved passively, and I'm very proud of the choices SF made to support evidence-based policy, equity, and STEAM, with each building up rather than detracting from the other. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Valorie (DC): Thanks for participating in the AMA, Kal, and great q! This was, by far, the most challenging and inspiring thing, I've ever done. What started as a few independent conversations in social media platforms in January quickly grew into a global movement with hundreds of thousands of active supporters! Much of the organizing involved working together with lots of people across time zones, almost all of us total strangers with varying backgrounds and skillsets and day jobs and personal obligations to boot! It was a truly extraordinary feat to coordinate, and I tip my hat to everyone involved and all the people who organized/continue to organize grassroots campaigns! Now we are working in conjunction (partnering organization representatives, satellite organizers, and the feedback from marchers) to maintain and grow the global network and infrastructure to keep championing science for the common good. 

Selection on public statements and AMAs vary, depending on availability (as we have all been passion project volunteers!), relevancy (role in organization), and other factors. It has surely been a gargantuan and galvanizing experience being involved in this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Steph: Absolutely - I get it. When I was in graduate school, I started an outreach program in our lab. We organized field trips for students to learn from my PI, tour the MRI, and get some selfies with real brains (which once led to me having to answer an 8 year old's question: "Was this in someone's head once? Are they OK? O_O).

It was a huge challenge and it's a problem that there is not well developed infrastructure to support these sorts of programs more broadly. Scientists need to do their part, but we also need to support liaisons who know how to run these sorts of programs. There are currently very few jobs for the "in-betweeners" as my old lab called me. 

The People's Science does have a science communication/training wing. We recently went to UC Davis, for example, where we spoke to a wonderful group of scientists called "Science Says" about these sorts of issues and best practices. 

I think training is helpful, but institutional support is just as important. Many researchers I've worked with over the years feel that doing outreach work is at lease somewhat at odds with their career plans; that the culture of science isn't currently conducive to prioritizing these efforts. We have to find a way to change that. I think that March for Science has a great opportunity here to scale and implement support programs in Satellite locations. My hope is that your local Satellite would have a program in place or work with a local partner organization that had such a program so that the role of the scientists is to show up, talk, listen, and do their part... rather than playing the part of the organizer. Then, educational organizations like The People's Science and ComSciCon and League of Extraordinary Scientists can all contribute to providing resources to fill in the educational gaps for such programs. It's going to have to be a team effort.

For resources and a selection of research articles on science communication and outreach more broadly, check out our ongoing list: www.shareyourscience.org. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Valorie (DC): Thanks for your question, Ludovico. I just want to assure you that nobody was hired to misrepresent the MFS mission, which I reiterate here: The March for Science champions robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity. We unite as a diverse, nonpartisan group to call for science that upholds the common good and for political leaders and policy makers to enact evidence based policies in the public interest (https://www.marchforscience.com/mission/).

That being said, with hundreds of thousands of people participating in marches in over 600 locations on April 22, and the many more paying attention on traditional and social media, there are many, many voices about how science impacts diverse individuals and communities. These are important, ongoing conversations, and change begins from local to global. I urge people to stay engaged locally, to participate in our Week of Action (with many actions being globally applicable), and to stay involved in these crucial dialogues about how the science communities and general public can keep working together and listening to each other to champion and improve how science serves (or can better serve) us all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Steph: Speaking from SF perspective specifically here. Yes, absolutely. I don't think I've ever learned so much about myself in such a short period of time. Every day was a new challenge. As a grassroots movement, we were defining our goals, defining our roles, developing partnerships, fundraising, and juggling tasks that I'd never heard of three months ago... all while trying to figure out how best to work with a team of people we'd never met before. We were pulled together and forward simply by our commitment to speak up for equitable evidence-based policy. 

Now that we have space to breathe and reflect, our next steps in SF are to identify what went well, what gaps there were in our knowledge and skills, and what structure/programs we need to move forward, including strategies for effectively communicating our core goals and messages. It was definitely a crash course in a lot of things that were never on my to-learn list, but I'm very excited to channel those lessons into long-term impact. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Valorie (DC): The MFS global movement demonstrated that science has no borders; the urgency and the desire to express solidarity in championing and improving the role of science in society went beyond the US borders. Of course, specific issues at each place and country were clear as well, and we can't deny the current sociopolitical climate in the US, and how that affects geopolitics. At the same time, we are strongly committed to being and remaining nonpartisan. After all, that's one of the core issues we marched for -- to keep partisan politics out of science. Acknowledging and voicing support and actively engaging to ensure that science continues to be a strong priority in our lives and societies absolutely delves into the political -- but does not and should not be partisan. That science helps us prolong and save lives, enables us to monitor for air and water and food quality, for improving national security, for giving us tools to build a better future -- those are not and should not be partisan, despite how much other people may want to paint them in that light. Science improves and can better improve all our lives, and all our communities. 

I understand your hesitancy in joining one of the Marches, but I urge you to reconsider involvement. The only way to be heard is to speak up. Have your voice join the voices around the world that proclaim: we champion science that serves the common good! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Steph: In many ways, this is *the* question. How do we make sure science is not branded as "belonging" to any given party so that it can be celebrated and utilized equally by all? I think it's a complex question with many possible answers, some of which March for Science can address directly and others that require a broader societal shift. I've heard many stories of conservative scientists feeling isolated by their peers, for example, so inclusivity has to start from within the culture of science itself. That's the long game. 

Speaking specifically from SF's perspective in the short-term, we have plans to produce stories that focus on a given socioscientific issue that's often presented as a partisan issue. We're currently developing a program that partners with groups that typically see the issue differently, telling the stories and backgrounds of both sides, and facilitating dialogue. We also hope to shed light on the stories of those who break the stereotype of the "typical" scientist, whether religiously, politically or otherwise. Our hope is that by respecting, featuring, and encouraging informed dialogue across perspectives or profiles, we can take one step closer to breaking down some of these perceived barriers. This won't play out the same way everywhere, so it's important that individual Satellites tailor their initiatives to their local communities.

Of course, no single program is going to fix these problems, but my hope is that this movement will have inspired enough efforts that, if coordinated, we're able to move in a better direction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Valorie (DC): Thanks for your questions! April 22 was just the start. Now we #keepmarching for sustained, coordinated science advocacy! One of the first steps toward that is our Week of Action: https://satellites.marchforscience.com/, where we highlight daily themes, impacts, educational and advocacy components for participants to engage in and share! We will continue working on co-developed and original initiatives in the future, in collaboration with partnering organizations and the thousands of satellite organizers and marchers around the world. Throughout the past few months, we have been communicating with and listening to these groups, via email, phone, social media, and other platforms. Our mission and identity stays the same -- championing nonpartisan science for the common good. 

The success of any grassroots campaign like this one, and the OWS movement, can be measured in several ways. I don't think previous movements 'failed' so much as there are short- and long-term scales and goals at which to gauge success. The turnouts on April 22 with over 600 locations around the globe participating in solidarity to champion science and its role in society was a success. Moving forward, it will take more time to see how those efforts lead to concrete changes. But already, we are seeing so much local engagement happening with people initiating their own science clubs at schools, pledging to become more consistent voters, starting or joining science meet-ups and get-togethers (such as participating in the taste of science festival or Get Out the Science), hosting science teach-ins, and more. Truly, it is incredible. </TEXT>

I can solidly state it was more than the 10k reported in various media outlets :) Many satellite marches are still reporting crowd estimates, and we look forward to providing an overall # when we receive the data!

SF, LA, NYC, Chicago, Seattle had large turnouts as well! Equally amazing were the smaller but important turnouts in the middle of the country, abroad, and even under water (Wake Atoll divers!)! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Steph: Great question. Satellites were an incredible resource to one another throughout the planning process. There was a lot of resource sharing and collaborative problem solving that I think set the tone for what needs to happen next. If the goal is to build a unified network moving forward, it has to start with maintaining the lines of communication between Satellites and building effective bidirectional lines of communication between Satellites and national. 

The beginnings of this is in the works. A couple of weeks ago, Satellites were sent an overview of possible future plans and invited to provide feedback, both about what they think the organization should become and what role they think the Satellites should play within it. The next step is synthesizing and folding in that feedback as a post-March organizational structure is finalized. Our goal in soliciting feedback from as many groups as possible is to champion a collective vision that strikes the balance between supporting Satellites to make the decisions that best fit their local community and providing sufficient infrastructure for this to become a sustainable organization. 

On a personal note, I believe that it's the incredible network of Satellites that gives this movement a chance to have a serious impact - so a critical part of this process is taking the time to hear what they need to move forward. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Valorie (DC): Thank you so much! It was a joy to see the crowd in DC from the mainstage, despite the rain, and to see all the supporters and marchers on the street after the rally! We are definitely discussing this being an annual event and will know more after discussion with satellite organizers and partnering organizations. In the meantime, please continue to encourage engagement on our Week of Action: http://p2a.co/3BfL3J9, which features highlighted daily impact actions, a postcard initiative running all week for people to send support statements to representatives from global to local levels, and supplementary actions co-developed or originated by our partner organizations! NCSE also has a science teach-in toolkit publicly available as a helpful starting resource to hold informal science teach-ins anywhere any time! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Valorie (DC): I think what we witnessed on April 22 was hundreds of thousands of people around the world demonstrating their desire to have science and scientists play a more active role in improving and strengthening the role of science in society and policy. Many of the marchers are science enthusiasts and advocates, and marching together with people embedded in science communities displayed a commitment to working together to champion and improve how science serves all our communities. We heard the message loud and clear -- people want to see more scientists out there, and more scientists felt empowered to do that! 

Emphasizing the role that science plays to undergird our economies, to prolong and save lives, to ensure we have clean air and safe food and water, to bolster national defense -- that is nonpartisan no matter which way people cut it. Speaking to people's values -- what matters in day to day lives -- is crucial. The MFS movement is aspirational, not negative. After all, the brand of science is HOPE, and science enables us with the best tools to reduce inherent human biases, to address our modern problems, and to help us build the better futures we envision. We must keep working hard from local to global to not only relay this message, but to demonstrate it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Valorie (DC): The global March for Science movement kicked off with more than 600 marches around the world in celebration and defense of science in society and policy.  But those marches were just the beginning! Now, the real work begins. On Sunday, we rebooted our website to highlight a Week of Action that keeps building on the momentum from April 22 into sustained, coordinated science advocacy impacts: http://marchforscience.com/. We must #keepmarching to channel the energy and momentum from the march into a series of focused and connected actions demonstrating our support for science and science-based policy, and to communicate how science serves or can better serve our communities.  

In addition to the daily messages, impact actions, and education links, threading through the whole week is a postcard initiative, where we urge participants to send an e-postcard expressing support for science/March for Science/free inquiry/critical thinking/local issues. It kicked off yesterday http://p2a.co/3BfL3J9 with a letter to the President of the UN General Assembly and continues going from global to local representatives! </TEXT>

Hi Reddit,

My name is Valorie Aquino, and I am a PhD Candidate in Anthropology at the University of New Mexico. My research reconstructs and compares original, high-resolution archaeological and paleoclimatological records to better understand the articulation of climate volatility and politics in the ancient Maya world. I am an organizer with the [March for Science DC](https://satellites.marchforscience.com/), where my role is Co-chair.
My name is Stephanie Fine Sasse and I am Co-Founder   Creative Director at [The People's Science](http://thepeoplesscience.org/#home). My work focuses on improving the relationship between science, society, and the individual through educational technology, informal learning, and interactive STEAM experiences. I am also an organizer with the March for Science SF, where my role is Chair of the Partners   Programming committees. I also supported the national team in their Week of Action and initial post-March development.


With over 600 satellite marches worldwide, there's no doubt that March for Science was an incredible moment. Now the question on everyone's mind is how we can turn that moment into a movement. That's no easy feat, but I can't tell you how excited I am that we have this chance to try.

One thing i would note here as we did in the paper was that this was a convenience sampling of only two local colleges (although incoming students are selected nationwide). It could be entirely possible that if we did a more nationwide representative sampling we might be able to capture this key group thats missing in the current study. Having said that the data that we report here is very consistent with the harvard school study published in 2001 where 17000 students nationwide were ascertained and they found only .0003% of their sample to to consume marijuana alone with no alcohol.

<TEXT> Author SM: Hello - Thanks for the question. What you say is absolutely possible, however as we explicitly indicate in our paper, the analysis that we did just wasn't geared towards examining any causality. We tried to somewhat alleviate effects of intermediate variables by controlling for baseline measured personality and emotional traits. However to properly investigate what you allude to requires a causal modelling analysis such as SEM etc. We plan on doing this in the near future at least on the baseline variables to see what the data shows us. Again this is just the tip of the iceberg, much more to come in the future years! </TEXT>

<TITLE> PLOS Science Wednesday: Hi Reddit, were Shashwath and Godfrey and we assessed how the use of alcohol and marijuana impacted college students academic performance over the long-term  Ask Us Anything! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-19 13:17:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Shashwath Meda and I am a Senior Clinical Research Associate at Olin Neuropsychiatry, Hartford Hospital/Institute of Living. I am also joined by Dr. Godfrey Pearlson who is the Director of Olin Neuropsychiatry and a Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University. A primary component of our research here at the center focuses on studying the effects of substance use on brain cognition and function.

We recently published a study titled [Longitudinal influence of alcohol and marijuana use on academic performance in college students](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172213 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=reddit-ama-0417) in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone). In this study, we evaluated the combined effects of alcohol and marijuana on academic GPA in 1142 freshman college students who were followed up longitudinally over a two-year time period. During this period, each month we collected data on their alcohol and marijuana use patterns while in college through a secure self-report website. In analyzing these data, we identified three substance-use groups, **a)** a group that used either no or very low amounts of both alcohol and marijuana, **b)** students that used no/low marijuana but medium-high amounts of alcohol and **c)** students that consumed medium-high quantities of both substances. Interestingly, we found almost no one that consumed no-low alcohol but high amounts of marijuana.

Our findings show that despite students having the same pre-baseline academic achievement as measured using the SAT scores, at the end of incoming semester those who heavily used either alcohol or alcohol+MJ had a significantly lower GPA compared to those who abstained or had very little of it. We also noticed that students who consumed fairly large quantities of alcohol alone (very little MJ) did not have a consistent decrease in GPA across the two-year period (we only noticed a significant decrease in GPA for the incoming semester). Finally, **our follow up analysis suggested that those who moderated drug use over the period of the study could recover and perform better academically**.

<TEXT> Woolly mammoths could not eat trees. Their teeth are flat with shallow ridges that ground up grasses, similar to Savannah elephants. This is one of the factors that contributed to their extinction.  As forests grew up over the Siberian grasslands, the mammoths struggled to find food.  Combined with human predation, their numbers dwindled.  Mastodons have a completely different tooth structure, with sharper points.  Their name even means nipple toothed.  Mastodons (and possibly Columbian mammoths) could eat twigs and bark, but woolly mammoths could not. 

Wrangel Island is an unusual habitat. It does not have grasslands, but scrubby bushes.  The island gets hit periodically with arctic cyclones.  These storms rip up trees and prevent them from growing on the island.  The cyclones make Wrangel Island a harsh environment to live in, but in the end they may be one reason why the mammoths could persist on the island even after the mainland populations were extinct.

That gene causes a satin coat in mice, and it's involved in fur formation in other mammals. So long as the gene acts the same way in mammoths that it does in lots of other mammals, the mammoth would have a very shiny coat.  </TEXT>

It could be that selective pressures changed-- predators weren't found on the island, the plant composition was different, perhaps there was less sexual selection.  It could equally be true that breaking olfactory receptors just isn't that bad.  It's not as if the mammoth drops dead when one olfactory receptor is broken.

<TEXT> I've wanted to work on mammoths since Kindergarten.  I had heard about arctic explorers who found mammoths frozen in ice sheets with fur still on them.  To me it seemed like the closest you could get to having a time machine.  We could still see what these animals looked like even tens of thousands of years after they had died off.  

When Love Dalen's lab published these mammoth sequences, I downloaded them the same day.  It was exciting to get to work on mammoths, but even more exciting when I saw what looked like a genomic meltdown.  It's probably one of the more fun projects I've worked on.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mammoths went back and forth from the mainland to the island when glaciers covered the Siberia and sea levels were higher.  The mammoths became isolated on the island as sea levels rose.  There's some debate about the exact timing but we know that by 12,000 years the mammoths were only on the island.  

There's some debate about how far the mammoths could swim in the arctic, and also about how think the ice sheets were in winter vs summer months.  By 12,000 years ago the channel between Wrangel Island and the mainland was too wide for them to cross.   Thankfully it kept the humans away for a long time as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We would expect that a population, once brought back to large population size, would purge some of the bad mutations.  There is a nice paper with this theory from Balick et al. (link below).  This purging will take a VERY long time.   

With the large deletions that we studied it will be even more difficult to undo the damage.  Once a gene is completely deleted, how do you get it back?  Most of my research is on new gene formation.  It is much more difficult to get new beneficial genes than it is to repair a single letter change in the DNA.  There could be other compensatory mutations, but that's difficult to guarantee.

<TEXT> Transposable elements are selfish genetic elements that live in the genomes of most eukaryotes.  They copy themselves like viruses, even if it causes harm to the host.  There is constant conflict over evolutionary time.  TEs will proliferate and cause bad mutations, the cell will come up with a repressor to keep the TE quiet, and then the TE will mutate again to proliferate.  It's a genetic arms race that leads to some pretty exciting biology.

Generally genetic engineering studies would only mutate one gene at a time.  The gestation time for an elephant is 1 yr, and the generation time is minimum 15 years.  Take your best guess about how many genetic changes you would need, and multiply that by 16 yrs.  I'm not ordering a mammoth saddle.

<TEXT> Our study was whole genome and high throughput.  There are some mutations where we were certain enough about exactly what the genetic change was AND the genes do the same thing in multiple types of animals.  These are mutations in riboflavin kinase, FOXQ1 (the satin locus), urinary proteins, and olfactory/pheromone receptors.  There are other bad mutations in the mammoth, but with some of them we couldnt nail down exactly where the breakpoints were.  Some of the uncertainty is related to working with ancient DNA, and some simply requires doing focused work on just those gene sequences.  

Some suggest that this mammoth may have had terrible diseases or that he may have had difficulty reproducing.  It will take some more work to say exactly which of those are real and what the exact nature of those mutations might be.  If even 10% of those were real, this mammoth had problems.

<TEXT> The mammoth from Wrangel Island was somewhat inbred, not from siblings but from matings between distant cousins.  This analysis was presented in Palkapoulou et al 2015, along with the sequence data.  Inbreeding leaves different genetic signatures compared with genomic meltdown.  It increases the likelihood that a single individual carries recessive detrimental mutations at the same locus, causing bad effects. If both mom and dad are related and carry the same bad mutation, its more likely that their offspring will look like mutants than if they mate with a random individual (who is less likely to carry the bad mutation).  This phenomenon would show in the genome as lots of sites that are homozygous where the chromosome from mom and the chromosome from dad look identical.

We saw that in small populations, bad mutations accumulated across the entire genome as natural selection became less efficient.  We saw an increase in mutations that would break gene sequences in the small population, then did mathematical modeling to show that these effects were consistent with expectations of how bad mutations accumulate due to genetic drift.  The accumulation of bad mutations genome wide across many different genes is the product of genomic meltdown. At the FoxQ1 gene we even saw two bad mutations in the same gene but with different origins.  This would not happen with inbreeding.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We know that the mutations at FoxQ1 should change the fur structure and produce the satin phenotype, as long as this gene acts the same way in mammoths that it does in other mammals.  Mammoths had very stiff outer guard hairs that helped keep the snow off.  Paleontologists have suggested that the inner core of the furs was very important for mammoths in generating these coarse hairs.  Other paleontologists have argued a bit over the fine details of their claim.  If the stiff core was an adaptation, then yes, this mutation would compromise that adaptation. 

We also know that the same gene helps replenish cells in the stomach as they are eroded by stomach acid.  Satin rabbits often need special diets because they have GI issues.  It seems likely that the mammoths would have had similar problems with heartburn.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> These are great questions.  

With only two samples to analyze, we had to use theory and mathematical modeling to tell us whether the differences we saw were too extreme to be explained by variation within a population.  There are very well established theories to explain how much variation should be present in a population.  Based on these theories, the two mammoths were 28 standard deviations apart much too extreme for them to have come from the same type of population.  We then showed that in small population sizes, we would expect an accumulation of negative mutations similar to what we saw in the Wrangel Island mammoth.  Without this mathematical modeling, we would not have been able to make the same conclusions.  

We also saw that all different types of mutations pointed in the same direction. The Wrangel Island mammoth had an excess of amino acid changing mutations, an excess of premature stop codons, an excess of deletions, an excess of deletions affecting gene sequences, and an excess of retrogenes (reflecting transposable element activity).  Its pretty rare in my experience to have such a massive difference AND to have the same signal in every type of mutation. 

With respect to sequencing, the error rate for Illumina is pretty low, but we wouldnt expect error from the sequencer to affect one sample that much more than the other.  We did check to make sure the differences in mutations werent artifacts of differences in coverage or differences in DNA damage.  We specifically limited the analysis to large deletions because smaller deletions are more likely to be artifacts.  But yeah, there was a lot of angst and extra analysis trying to make sure the effects that we saw werent just a fluke.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fun question!! 

Im not 100% sure but Ill give you my back of the envelope calculation.  I read that the average satin rabbit produces 12 oz of wool per shearing. Lets say they are ~6 in tall, compared with a mammoth that is 12 ft tall.  12 /.5 * .75= 18 lbs of fur. 

Or comparing with sheep 5 lbs of wool per sheep and they are about 3 ft tall.  12/3 *5 = 20 lbs.  So Im going to say roughly 20 lbs per shearing.  (Sheep bred for fur may have much greater yields, I'm going with numbers closer to wild sheep.) 

Mammoths had stiff guard hairs to keep the snow off.   Rabbits with guard hairs are not considered ideal for fur, so Im not sure how much would actually be useful.  Note that none of these calculations have passed peer review. 

It does add to the mystery of why no one domesticated the mammoths.  Feel free to contribute your own estimates.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most genes in humans have a direct match in other mammals. Even more broadly across the tree of life, we know that 77% of disease genes in humans have a direct match in fruit flies.  One recent experiment showed that if you replace a fruit fly gene with a human gene, 70% of the time the flies would still live.  We can compare the DNA sequence and the protein sequence between mammoths, mice, humans, and flies to match up the different genes and functions.  This is one of the reasons why research in model organisms is so important.  It means that if we find an effect in mice or fruit flies, it is likely we will observe similar effects in other organisms, including humans.

<TEXT> We know where the genes are in the African elephant genome.  We can then go look at the mammoth DNA, match it up with African elephants, and see which spots in the genome have mutations that use different letters, or mutations that take a chunk of DNA and delete it or move it around. Deletions, which just take out big chunks of DNA can break gene sequences. We  know that generally breaking genes is a bad thing. 

Some single letter changes may have no effect because they do not change the protein sequence.  Other single letter changes may break the gene and stop protein production part-way through.  We know that these mutations that break genes are usually bad.  A third class of mutations may change the protein sequence but not break it completely.  It can be difficult to tell the impacts of any single amino acid change just from looking at the sequence. 

We know that as a class it would be unusual to have tons of these mutations genome wide compared to another individual in the same species.  It would also be unusual to have an excess of bad mutations across multiple classes (deletions, retrogenes, and point mutations).

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


My name is Rebekah L. Rogers and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioinformatics at UNC Charlotte. My research focuses on genome structure changes and new gene formation.


I recently published a study titled [Excess of genomic defects in a woolly mammoth on Wrangel Island](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006601 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=reddit-ama-0412) with Montgomery Slatkin. We reanalyzed genome sequences for two woolly mammoths. One specimen came from Siberia at a time when mammoths were happy and healthy. The other comes from a small population that existed on Wrangel Island until 3700 years ago, another 600 years after all mainland mammoths had gone extinct.



We found that bad mutations were accumulating in woolly mammoth genomes just before they went extinct. The accumulation of bad mutations is consistent with mathematical theories predicting that natural selection becomes inefficient in small populations. Under these circumstances, bad mutations could accumulate in genomes that normally would be weeded out by competition. The mammoth from Wrangel Island had 50% more of its genes broken compared with the mainland mammoth from much earlier.  Several different types of bad mutations had accumulated large deletions in the DNA, retrogenes (which reflect the action of selfish virus-like DNA sequences), and single letters that would cause genes to terminate early. Many of the broken genes are urinary proteins and the olfactory receptors that detect them  genes important for social signaling. We also discovered that the mammoth from the island had mutations that would give him a shiny satin coat.



These results may be important for conservation. They suggest that other very small populations of endangered species might undergo the same type of mutational meltdown.  In our mammoths, we found that it required many generations to see a signal as strong as what we observed in the Wrangel Island genome.  **The sooner we can intervene to bring endangered species back to normal levels, the better off their genomes will be.** There are many factors that influence extinction. Climate change, habitat destruction, and hunting were all very important for the mammoths demise. Still, these bad mutations certainly did not help them as the struggled to adapt on the island.

<TEXT> Good questions. Presumably during that time cyanobacteria were still the main producers of free oxygen, but nowadays plants have that responsibility. Geochemists suggest O2 in the atmosphere was somewhere between 1 and 10% of the present level. The question why I took a billion years for multicellulars to take hold is crucial. My take on that is that it needed the introduction of animals, but the jury is certainly out. I hope to be able to fill in more of the gaps in our knowledge of early multicellular evolution, but it's a long process. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a long story. In 2006 I was contacted by an Indian colleague, Rafat Azmi, who had been accused of research fraud when he published reports of Cambrian fossils in the Vindhyan rocks of central India. The charge was that he had contaminated his samples with Cambrian fossils from other places. I went to India and accompanied Azmi to his field sites. The rocks I collected were shipped directly to Sweden for laboratory preparation. I found the same fossils he had reported, thus exonerating him from accusations of fraud, but I concluded he had misidentified the fossils. "Worm tubes" turned out to be some form of filamentous algae, etc. We also performed a radiometric dating (Pb-Pb isochron) of the fossiliferous rocks and found that they were late Palaeoproterozoic in age (1,650  89 Ma). We published these results in 2009: Bengtson, S., Belivanova, V., Rasmussen, B., and Whitehouse, M. 2009. The controversial Cambrian fossils of the Vindhyan are real but more than a billion years older. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 106:77297734.

At about the same time we started to investigate microfossils using synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM), specifically on the filamentous algae, revealing both cellular and subcellular structures of the fossils. Therese Sallstedt began a Ph.D. project on the microbial biomats in the same rocks, and we went together to India in 2011 to procure more and better samples. When Therese found fleshy colonies of presumed algae we decided to combine our studies and found evidence enough to suggest that we were dealing with different kinds of early red algae. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In this case, as is often the case, we stood on the shoulders of geologists who had come before us, doing painstaking geological mapping and field studies to clarify the nature of the rocks and underlying sedimentary and metamorphic processes. We had much help from Indian geologists, as is evident from references and acknowledgments in the article.
With microfossils, you usually can't see them until you are back in the lab and have prepared the samples. So field work usually means coming back for more educated sampling once you know what's there. Understanding the context of the rocks is paramount. </TEXT>

<TEXT> These are good questions. My short answer that there is always a chance that fossils, particularly simple fossils, are misinterpreted. We have simply presented the best interpretation we can based on the available evidence. Im fully confident that the fossils are of multicellular organisms and that they belong to eukaryotes (having cells with nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles - we are eukaryotes, and so are plants and fungi). What I cannot be 100% confident about is that some previously unknown and extinct lineage of algae evolved features similar to those of red algae. Im looking forward to discussions about that - its essential in science to weigh different hypotheses against each other.

With regard to the age, Im very confident in the ca. 1.6 billion years, because measurements have been made from these and adjacent rocks independently by weveral laboratories using different but well-established methods, and they all give comparable results. The methods are based on the known decay rates of various radioactive isotopes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We (or to be specific: our geochronological coauthor Martin Whitehouse) dated the fossiliferous rocks directly, using the lead-lead method. This method has good accuracy but poor precision: our result was given as 1,650 plus/minus 89 million years. The same method had previously been used to date a presumed time-equivalent rock in the nearby Son River Valley, and the results were very similar (numbers given in our paper). Two other laboratories had previously dated zircon grains in adjacent rocks using the much more precise uranium-lead method. The results clustered very closely to 1,630 plus/minus a few million years, but with the caveat that this method measures the age of the grains, not of the sediment itself. There are more such data, but with a few outliers they converge on the same age. In all, Im very confident about the results. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Algae thrive in shallow water, where they can capture sunlight. The situation on the seafloor in what is now central India was ideal for them. The fossils suggest that the biotope was dominated by cyanobacteria (previously known as blue-green algae, but they are bacteria), but we have no record of other types of organisms than bacteria and algae in those rocks. Thats not to say there werent other life forms present (we have been fervently looking for fungi, but no luck), but we haven seen them.

Though an early appearance of plants also means that the lineage leading up to fungi and animals would also have existed at the same time, but they may not be recognizable as such if we find their fossils. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, we are talking different time scales here. When our Indian algae appeared, life had already existed on Earth at least two billion years. If we are looking for a possible origina of Earthly life from space (i.e. a panspermia hypothesis) we have to look at much earlier evidence.

We seem to have no rocks preserved from the first half billion years of Earths history, so its difficult to say how soon conditions would permit formation of the more complex building blocks of life. This relates to the complex issue of the origin of life on Earth, which is apart from the question of lifes subsequent evolution. Im not the right person to answer that question (AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its an interesting shift of perspectives here: Animals were probably the drivers behind the Cambrian Explosion in the marine realm because of their interaction (grazing, predation, commensalism, etc.) with other organisms, which created a kind of arms race that lead to the burgeoning of all kinds of multicellular organisms. But when it comes to transforming the land surfaces, early credit must go to plants and fungi. That said, plants were important also before the Cambrian, and animals continued to play their games on land.

In terms of how to tell the story of the transition to land, I would stress the constant interplay between different life forms (and lets not forget that the biosphere is still mostly microbial!), rather than a fish crept up and conquered land and then came dinosaurs and us.

<TEXT> The main lesson I think is that we must take the paucity of the early fossil record seriously and ask whether various eukaryote lineages may in fact have evolved earlier than we thought. The Phanerozoic fossil record (i.e. the last 541 million years) is rich and gives us an enormous amount of information of lifes evolution. But the first 4 billion years of Earths history is much more scantily represented in rocks, because the older a rock is, the more likely is it to have been altered, changed beyond recognition, or obliterated by geological processes. Hopefully, by reevaluating the early history of eukaryotes we will be able to understand much better the processes that led up to the Cambrian explosion between 600 and 500 million years ago, when multicellular life changed the face of the Earth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thats almost inevitable. Multicellularity is rampant among organisms and has evolved independently in more than a dozen now living lineages. As most taxa that ever lived on Earth are now extinct, the likelihood is great that multicellular lineages have died out, not leaving any living descendants.

But you may be hinting at an even grander question: Could life have originated several times, died out, and then started again from scratch. Again, this may have happened, but its exceedingly difficult for us to find out. And once our life got well enough established, it would like have quenched all other experiments in evolution. All life that we know is related. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First a clarification: Multicellular life has evolved many times over, also in prokaryotes. But many branches of multicellular life are simple: cells coming together to function as a more-or-less organized colony. Advanced multicellularity, with differentiation of cells into tissues, tissues into organs, organs into individuals, etc., mostly characterizes the three groups we know and love: Plants, fungi, animals. There are a few more groups in that category, such as brown algae, but the three major ones are what has made all the difference for life on Earth. The Indian red algae are not the first multicellular organisms in the fossil record, but they are in my view the oldest ones that we can with some confidence identify with known higher taxa.

The biosphere at that time in Earth history is generally considered to have been almost exclusively microbial. The algae we report lived in shallow marine water within or in contact with cyanobacterial mats. They provide tangible evidence that advanced multicellularity, at least in plants, appeared much earlier than previously thought, raising the question why it took another billion years before multicellular organisms, including animals, began to dominate and transform the biosphere. Plants are particularly important in this respect, as together with fungi they eventually came to transform the land surface, enabling invasion of the land by animals. Plants are also responsible for most of the oxygen-generating photosynthesis on Earth today. </TEXT>

Hi Reddit,

My name is Stefan Bengtson, and I am an Emeritus Professor of Paleozoology at the Swedish Museum of Natural History. My research focuses on the origin and early evolutionary history of multicellular organisms.


I recently published with colleagues an article titled ["Three-dimensional preservation of cellular and subcellular structures suggests 1.6 billion-year-old crown-group red algae"](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000735 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=reddit-ama-0405) in [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/). We studied exquisitely preserved fossils from phosphate-rich microbial mats formed 1.6 billion years ago in a shallow sea in what is now central India. To our surprise, we found fossils closely resembling red algae, suggesting that plants - our benefactors that give us food to eat, air to breathe, and earth to live on - existed at least a billion years before multicellular life came into dominance and reshaped the biosphere.


**I will be answering your questions at 1 pm ET -- Ask Me Anything!**

What we know is that compared to folks with high PHS, people with low PHS don't progress to AD and don't have as much amyloid or tau in their brain and dont show as much brain atrophy or cognitive decline

For AD, one potential recommendation to consider would be to use our test in those older folks who have confirmed memory impairment. If you have a clinically confirmed memory impairment + high genetic risk, you will likely benefit from additional diagnostic testing (MRI, PET or CSF amyloid). If you have memory impairment + low genetic risk, may consider testing for reversible causes first (B12, thiamine, etc)

<TEXT> I agree that the potential aspects of early detection of a disease which has no efficient treatment is an important ethical issue. People have different preferences, and they also react differently to such information. However, before this method can get into clinical use - a proper evaluation including ethical aspects must be done. Therefore, a very important use of the method is to stratify clinical trials - i.e. make testing of new drugs more efficient by reducing variance by selecting people with same genetic risk. Then the studies of new medication will become more efficient, and improve the likelihood of developing efficient treatments.   </TEXT>

Big difference between our paper and the Escott-Price PGS Brain pape is that we don't assume that Alzheimer's is a dichotomous process where some folks get diseases (cases) and others don't (controls). Given the age dependency, if you live long enough, you will get AD. In this framework, you have to use a survival model where you look at EVERYONE'S risk for getting AD -- not just cases </TEXT>

Really depends on what you mean by a 'cure' -- even among those people with very low genetic risk, we found that they eventually develop AD. That is, if you live long enough, you will get AD (just like osteoarthiritis). As such, a 'cure' may mean therapies that can delay age of onset.

This is a really good question. I think the analogy to BRCA1/2 is applicable to our score because our PHS is not a diagnostic test; that is, if you have BRCA1/2, you will get breast cancer. However, if you have a high PHS, it means that you are at high risk for AD but does not guarantee you will get the disease (subtle difference). As such, our test is more analagous to a 'risk factor' like atherosclerosis is to heart disease. As several people have pointed out, we don't know yet if there are things you can modify (lifestyle, envt variables, develop more cognitive reserve, etc) that can delay your onset even if youhave a high genetic risk for AD </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


My name is Ole Andreassen and I am a Professor in Psychiatry at University of Oslo. I have also a clinical position where I see patients regularly in the outpatient clinic at Oslo University Hospital. My research focuses on severe mental illness and neurodegenerative diseases.


We recently published an article titled [Genetic assessment of age-associated Alzheimers disease risk: development and validation of a polygenic hazard score](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002258 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=redditama-0329) in PLOS Medicine.  In this paper, we describe the development and validation of a new genetic score to predict Alzheimer's disease age of onset. Our results show that genetic data can be combined with epidemiological information on dementia incidence rates from the US population to derive a score that can predict age-specific risk for Alzheimer's disease.

<TEXT> Kaitlin, Paul, Alex: 
Climate change is less like E=MC2 and more like a medical diagnosis in which we cant be exactly sure of what is going to happen or where or when the biggest impacts will occur. What we would argue is that the question to ask is not whether you believe in climate change but whether you are willing to accept the risks that climate science suggests are likely to come true? Climate science indicates that there are things that can be done to reduce the risks that can have long term benefits, some of them at fairly low costs. But waiting to act increases the risks and raises the costs for when we have act on them later.

<TEXT> Kaitlin, Paul, and Alex: In the United States, where we in particular struggle with understanding and believing in climate change, well-funded denial and skepticism is a huge barrier. Recent research has found that climate change messages can help people understand climate change, but pairing a climate change message with an additional skeptical message can offset these positive outcomes.
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tops.12171/full. This is a problem because even though polling suggests that only about 10-12% of the US population are really skeptical about climate change, they are a vocal minority.

What can be done to help is to talk amongst your friends and family and talk to your elected officials about what you think about climate change so that there are other voices in the room. Part of what we were doing in our paper was to try to find ways to get people thinking about the pros and cons of different approaches so that they can engage in these types of discussions. We found that using an analogy to a progressive medical disease might be one way to get people thinking more deeply about what to do about climate change,the costs and benefits of different actions and the results of postponing action.

<TEXT> Kaitlin, Paul, and Alex here: We are certainly not meteorologists ourselves but have heard that some meteorologists are skeptical of our ability to predict long term climate change due to the difficulties of predicting short term weather. The modeling approaches are different for weather and climate.  And what your students may not know is that the research shows that the majority of metereologists do believe in anthropogenic climate change (http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-13-00091.1) and that they can have a really important and helpful role in educating the public about climate change (http://www.climateaccess.org/sites/default/files/Zhao_TV%20weathercasts.pdf). 

We think its absolutely important for natural scientists to communicate in ways that people can understand. In our paper, weve been trying to find useful analogies that would help people understand important characteristics of climate change. We think that natural scientists can help in this effort as well, and would encourage them and you to talk to and learn from communication specialists who study the best ways to do this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kaitlin, Paul, and Alex here: Kaitlin here: Reforestation is certainly one way to sequester carbon and most climate change models suggest that we need to both slow emissions and remove carbon from the atmosphere to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. For those who are interested, I recommend the National Research Council reports on Climate Intervention, which talk about the potential benefits and costs of reforestation and other forms of carbon dioxide removal (you can find them [linktext[(https://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/other-reports-on-climate-change/climate-intervention-reports/).

So if you think that reforestation is the goal, then what youd need to do is get people to support it, by planting trees on their own land and/or supporting policy measures to plant large forests. To do that, you need to give them some understanding of why this matters, but that is not enough. You also need to tie it into the values that they hold (whether those are values to help the environment or values to help other people, or even how this could help their own self-interest). 

Even though there might not be much that most people can do as individuals in terms of reforestation, they can support larger policies or community actions so you may want to focus your effort there.

<TEXT> Kaitlin, Paul, and Alex here: 
There has been a fair amount of research in recent years trying to pinpoint effective ways to talk to people who are dismissive or unsure of climate change in a way consistent with their values. For example, a recent paper found that discussing how taking care of the environment is patriotic made political conservatives more open to climate science. This makes sense; not everyone finds the same argument compelling. 

Talking about more general concerns, such as health or national defense considerations associated with environmental issues, is one way to potentially reach more people and not turn off climate change skeptics. Reaching that wider audience, and bypassing having to address peoples gut reactions to climate science, is certainly an appealing approach. 

The risk of trying to appeal to values for persuading people is that this approach to climate communication is still relatively new. Sometimes this approach works and sometimes it doesnt (or can even backfire if people feel like they are just being hoodwinked). This is why we have focused on not trying to persuade people of the right action but rather helping them develop a deeper understanding of the problem so that they can make their own decisions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is [Kaitlin Raimi](http://fordschool.umich.edu/faculty/kaitlin-raimi) and I am an Assistant Professor at the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on how people think and act when it comes to climate change, including how social motivations can promote or prevent sustainable solutions. I'm particularly interested in how people compare their own beliefs and behaviors to those of other people, how the desire to make a good impression can influence people to mitigate climate change, and how one adopting one sustainable behavior affects later environmental decisions. I also have ongoing work on how framing climate change in different ways affects people's understanding of climate change and support for climate policies.


Together with my colleagues [Paul Stern](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/BECS/DBASSE_068036) and [Alex Maki](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/viee/profiles/Alex-Maki.php), I recently published a paper titled ["The Promise and Limitations of Using Analogies to Improve Decision-Relevant Understanding of Climate Change"](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171130 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=redditama-0322) in the journal [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/).


My name is Alex Maki and I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment and the Vanderbilt Climate Change Research Network. My research uses theory-based behavior change interventions to understand and influence environmental (e.g., energy use), health (e.g., eating choices), and prosocial (e.g., volunteerism) behaviors. Specifically, I am interested in how interventions can help people initiate and maintain changes to multiple, related behaviors over time (e.g., both conserve energy and water at home). I also examine the social dynamics surrounding environmental behaviors, including who chooses to talk to other people (e.g., friends or family) about environmental issues, and how we can help people have more constructive conversations about important environmental issues, including climate change.


My name is Paul Stern.  For over two decades I was staff director of the Committee on the Human Dimensions of Global Change at the U.S. National Research Council.  At the same time, I have been conducting research with colleagues outside the Council on topics that have included household energy consumption, the effectiveness of policies to reduce greenhouse has emissions by changing consumer behavior, and people's understanding of various kinds of environmental risks.  Understanding the risks of climate change is a real challenge because of its long-term nature and the difficulty of making confident predictions of what risks particular communities will face.  This paper is part of an effort to find ways to help people think through the risks without having to understand all the scientific details.
 

We wanted to know whether using analogies helps people understand key factors that are important for climate change decisions, including uncertainties about when and where serious damage may occur, its unprecedented and progressive nature, and trade-offs in limiting climate change. Specifically, across two studies, we looked at whether comparing climate change to medical decision-making, disaster preparedness, or courtroom trials helped people to understand these issues. We found that disaster preparedness and a courtroom trial analogy weren't very helpful, and that none of the analogies helped people understand the basic science of climate change. However, we did find that comparing climate change to a medical decision helped people--especially political conservatives--to to better recognize several decision-relevant attributes of climate change.

I am joined by Ujwal Chaudhary, a postdoctoral researcher (group leader) at the Univ. Tuebingen, Germany. We work on brain-computer interfaces to help people in paralysis communicate.


We recently published an [article](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002593 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=redditama-0315) in PLOS Biology demonstrating direct brain communication of completely paralyzed, locked-in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehring's disease. In our study, four completely paralyzed patients (including eye paralysis) were able to answer many questions with a "yes" or "no" over extended time periods just by thinking yes or no. The thoughts were detected with a functional near infrared spectroscopy-based (fNIRS) auditory brain-computer interface at the bedside of these patients.


These results may be the first step towards abolition of completely locked-in states, at least for patients with ALS.

Most interesting to me is the connection to facial birth defects and syndromes, which is my other area of study.

Maybe a mutation in these genes results in a syndrome, but common variation in these same genes can influence typical-range traits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi this is Seth: I am fascinated by this stuff, especially from the historical perspective.  The practice you are talking about is called physiognomy and stretches back as far as aristotle.  what is really interesting is that there is all kinds of evidence that face and brain development are intimately linked.  There are facial differences in individuals with schizophrenia...and brain differences in individuals with cleft lip and palate (i did my post-doc on this).  Some recent studies have tried to connect facial morphology to aggression, which may make sense if both are influenced by hormones.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> John R. Shaffer:  Good question.  In genetics we study both families and unrelated individuals, and some scientific questions can be better addressed in one study design or the other.  In our study, unrelated individuals were used to help us understand population facial norms, and because it was helpful for the statistical analysis to have independent observations.  You are right that family studies can be very helpful to investigate genetics of all kinds of traits, including facial variation.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Katya: Some facial differences, including asymmetry, can signal an increased risk for genetic conditions. Most people have a few features, facial or otherwise, that are outside the "norm." For example, some people have hypertelorism (far apart spacing of the eyes), or a wide nasal bridge. But certain combinations of otherwise benign features can signal an increased risk for genetic conditions. One of the most common ones that comes to mind is 22q microdeletion, which presents with a wide nasal bridge, a longer face, and a smaller lower jaw (micrognathia), among others. Other examples include Waardenburg syndrome and Stickler syndrome. </TEXT>

good questions--that for the most part we don't have answers to !
(1)  there is a relatively new area of genetics studying imprinting which are situations in which some of one parent's genes are preferentially expressed in the offspring.  There are now many examples of these in animal models, and a couple examples in humans.  We don't yet know of any studies that have studied these mechanisms in human faces.
(2)  there are a variety of mechanisms that influence the expression of gene variants---one of those mechanisms is dominance of certain variants.
(3) there are some nutritional factors that can influence facial features but these are usually quite severe cases of nutritional imbalances. </TEXT>

The big problem with this approach to imaging the face is the radiation exposure.  We used 3d photography which is totally non-invasive.

This kind of work is still in its early stages.  As a side note: we work with some folks in the CANDELA consortium on a collaboration so stay tuned for that.  Here's how I see the main applications of our work: studies like this can help us gain a better understanding of how particular genes/pathways influence facial development (more of a basic science application), improve our knowledge of how genetic variation relates to the types of features we see with certain birth defects and syndromes (like why are some individuals more or less severely affected), and possibly (in the future) make predictive models about how the face grows. </TEXT>

Thanks for the question.  in the time since your son was born our research group and other groups around the world have been engaged in many genetics studies of cleft lip and palate.  To date about 20 genetic regions and some specific genes have been identified as associated with cleft lip and palate but it is important to note that these results so far are at a population level, that is we do not yet know how to apply these results to individual families.  So in summary, we are much closer to understanding the causes, developmental processes, and genes that contribute to cleft lip and palate but still have work to do. </TEXT>

Your last point about mosaicism is fascinating---for our study we took our genetic samples (DNA) from white blood cells, we did not take samples directly from the face.  Mosaicism could potentially influence the develop of body parts including the face, but to our knowledge no study has investigaged mosaicism in tissues from the face.

<TEXT> Hi this is Seth: There are a number of groups trying go from DNA to face, with a great interest from agencies like the FBI and police.  A critical thing to keep in mind is that this work is still in its infancy.  Researchers looking at the genetic basis of human facial shape have collectively identified a very small faction of the variants that influence these complex traits - thus, we can only explain a small amount of facial variation at this point.  Critically, though, even if ALL the genetic variants were known, we would still only have part of the story, because there are numerous non-genetic factors (diet, prenatal nutrition, mechanical forces) that influence the size and shape of our faces. So we are still a long way off in our view.  This however has not stopped companies from making claims that they can identify faces from DNA.  Right now, be suspicious of these claims. </TEXT>

I am a biological anthropologist by training and my research focuses on uncovering the factors that influence the development of normal and abnormal craniofacial variation.

The paper we will be discussing today is [Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Multiple Loci Influencing Normal Human Facial Morphology]( http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006149 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=redditama-0308) . For background, in a genome-wide association study or GWAS, millions of genetic variants spread across all the chromosomes are tested for a statistical relationship with one or more traits.  A GWAS can help researchers hone in on chromosomal regions (loci) that may harbor genes or other genetic elements of interest.  We measured over 3000 faces with 3D photogrammetry for this project, and then used these measurements as traits in our GWAS.  Although it may seem obvious that facial features have a genetic basis (e.g., familial resemblance), very little is known about how variation in specific regions of the genome relates to the kinds of distinguishing facial characteristics that give rise to our unique identities.  In this paper, we discovered a number of loci influencing different aspects of facial shape (e.g. spacing between the eyes or width of the nose).  Interestingly, many of these associated loci contained genes known to play a role in the development of the face.

I work with an interdisciplinary team comprised of human geneticists and biostatisticians.  I am here today with several of my colleagues including: John Shaffer (Assistant Professor of Human Genetics), Eleanor Feingold (Professor of Human Genetics), Mary Marazita (Professor of Oral Biology and Human Genetics), Katya Orlova (PhD student in Human Genetics), and Myoung Keun Lee (Biostatistician).

This is the first time our group is participating in a redditscience AMA, and we are excited to be here.

<TEXT> Privacy: There cold be issues if you determine you are at risk for a disease and you provider discriminates against you, which should not be possible for an existing condition. I would argue it is better to get these measurements and manage your health better, than stay private, but that is a personal decision. I wold also argue health care providers should be paying you (or offering you a discount) because I think you will manage you health better if you are collecting this information.

I think the devices and algorithms need reasonable testing and establishment of validity and this will require some regulatory oversight.  For detecting common is should be similar to that of an oral thermometer. For something more serious this will likely require more regulatory oversight by the FDA.

<TEXT> Tx for your enthusiasm. Lots of question here. For the genoe interpretation you really need to talk to an expert who can 
a) evaluate your risk for highly penetrant diseases (e.g. BRCA1, 2, SHBD, etc), 
b) drug response/sensitivity
c) Complex disease risk. This is more controversial, but it did work for me.

For wearables, we like heart rate skin temp, galvanic stress response (i.e. conductance across your skin), sleep and activity. The device we used for the study was Basis Peak because it measured all of these.  This device is no longer available.we are exploring apple watch (we did not exist when we started our study) and fitibit, among others, but presently they do non measure skin temperature and galvanic stress response which we think are important. So I guss you can say we are still looking around

For SpO2, we like the Masimo oximeter because it gives continuous SpO2 measurements. For the future I want ECG, blood pressure and continuous SpO2!

<TEXT> For most of the devices that we have used, some measurements are quite accurate, for example heart rate and SpO2, and even steps and activity are pretty good.  Even for devices that are less accurate you can still detect difference from baseline, and that is the key pointearly detection of differences relative to your healthy baseline. 

I suspect that the measurements made from these devices are more accurate than the measurements obtained during a brief visit in the doctors office. From wearable data, you can easily extract baseline (resting) heart rates, skin temp and other measurements by looking at a person dashboard for any length of time you wantdays, weeks months, etc We think this will be very powerful.

For device validation many companies do very extensive validation before they hit the market, usually with physician input. We perform our own internal valdiation of each device that we used just to be sure and impartial--it help us select the devices that we used.

If a device is generally flawed, I am not sure what the course of action is beyond blog posts and perhaps publishing the results. For an individual device one can reach out to the manufacturer and get a replacement--we have had not problem with that.

It think CGMs will be very powerful for T2D because people can see what foods cause what glucose spikes in individuals ad people can avoid those foods and stay with those that do not cause spikes.

For T1D is is not clear how this will affect treatment beyond what you are currently doing, but for other it could lead to early early detection. </TEXT>

My name is Mike Snyder, and I am the director of the [Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine](http://snyderlab.stanford.edu/). I recently published an article titled: [Digital Health: Tracking Physiomes and Activity Using Wearable Biosensors Reveals Useful Health-Related Information]( http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001402 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=redditama-0301) in [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology). The study explored the use of wearables device to help manage health. We found that heart rate, skin temperature and blood oxygen measured by portable devices can be used to identify inflammatory disease such as colds and Lyme disease and also distinguish insulin resistance (associated with progression to Type 2 diabetes) from insulin sensitivity. Portable device also revealed reduced oxygen on airline flights is associated with fatigue.

<TEXT> On the biological side though there is still ongoing research between if pervious dengue infection can make zika infection worse and vice versa. This process, known as antibody dependent enhancement, is known mostly for its role in dengue hemorrhagic fever but since zika has a similar fusion loop to dengue some researchers are looking into whether antibodies of those that have had dengue in the past partially attack zika but then not completely neutralize it and actually making it more virulent. Here is an interesting article about it http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v17/n9/full/ni.3515.html </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chris: Great question jemadoo.  There is a great amount of overlap between dengue and zika, as they are transmitted by the same type of mosquito. Many of the people in the country have been exposed to dengue in the past and I have not seen any study asking residents about their perception of healthcare after zika infection. 

This is more likely a problem of poverty and access to healthcare than the perception of healthcare. People of lower SES most often have poorer healthcare coverage and so if someone gets a low grade fever like what zika causes they would be less likely to go receive proper medical care for it.  </TEXT>

The factors discussed in our paper were targeted towards zikas two primary vectors, A aegypti and A albopictus.

<TEXT> In terms of spreading public awareness regarding the spread of disease it is disappointing that people would find the links between Zika and microcephaly unfounded. The CDC and other scientific agencies are very careful and conservative when they make a claim of causation between a disease and effect like they did with zika. https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/s0413-zika-microcephaly.html
       However I think that this is not just a problem with this topic alone but of current public distrust of science as a whole whether it be about climate change, vaccines, or birth defects related to zika. 
        The connection of zika as a teratogen is why much more of the United States knows what Zika is compared to Chickungunya or many other emerging infectious diseases. If there were more mild cases of the disease ie fever, joint pain,  rash most people and doctors would probably be unable to distinguish the disease from chickungunya or dengue. 
      From the zika outbreak we learned how necessary it is is to have funding for emerging diseases as in the funding needed to quickly do the research and develop vaccines for zika was debated in congress and then never passed While zika as an emerging disease is not that deadly, we should be ready and have funding available to research possibly more deadly emerging diseases in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Erin: Right now we have high densities of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (the two main vectors of Zika) in much of the Southeast US, as well as parts of California and going up the East Coast. Climate change could make the mosquito season longer and potentially allow the mosquitoes to spread further north. Warmer winters could allow the mosquito eggs to survive at higher rates. However, our risk in the US is to some degree mitigated by the generally decent housing conditions (air conditioning, window screens) and vector control services we have. That being said, there were a lot of Zika cases in south Florida when that local epidemic started, so I wouldn't rule out local transmission in the US. </TEXT>

These include dengue and chikungunya viruses, among others. Right now in Brazil there is a sylvatic (transmitted by forest mosquitoes) outbreak of yellow fever going on. If this ends up spilling into the urban Aedes aegypti mosquitoes we will have a huge problem on our hands. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jamieson

There is most definitely a correlation between socioeconomic status and vulnerability to disease. Those who live in poverty are often surrounded by more risk factors for diseases, such as crowded living conditions, poor sanitation, and the lack of a reliable sewage system. For mosquito borne diseases such as zika, these conditions are often optimal for their growth and reproduction. This does suggest that one way to combat vector borne disease would be to combat the structural issues related to poverty, therefore eliminating the conditions that are allowing the mosquitoes to breed and spread disease. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Erin: It was a great experiment for me. The students in my class were incredibly smart and insightful when it came to formulating hypotheses. They were able to quickly learn to read scientific articles and get the main points. It was a great experience co-authoring a paper with them, in part because they were good writers and generated lots of interesting discussion and ideas that I didn't have on my own. I am definitely planning to do student projects with the goal of publications again in the future. This year's class will explore temperature-dependence of vector-borne disease by collecting data from the scientific literature, as a way of understanding what may happen to disease under climate change. I would recommend trying this approach with a group of high-level, very motivated students (this was a class that students had to apply and write a short essay to get into, and was not a required class). Break your project down into small, manageable tasks with weekly milestones to help them succeed. Another helpful approach was to have the class read papers at home and do a short online quiz that asked them to summarize main points, then during class I knew which concepts people were grasping and which we needed to go over together. Finally, normalizing the activity by letting the students know that this exercise was challenging for everyone was important for making sure students felt confident to explore literature that they didn't understand 100% right off the bat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Erin here. It was a total experiment! Since the Zika epidemic was so new, there wasn't much scientific literature on it at the time. I thought that it might be possible for undergraduates to read most of what had been done on Zika relatively quickly. That made them relative experts in just a few weeks. We brainstormed together to come up with hypotheses for drivers and consequences of the epidemic, grouping them into three categories: environmental drivers, social drivers, and social consequences. The students then researched by reading papers on their own and wrote individual papers on topics of choice. They then wrote three group papers on the three major categories of hypotheses. Then our first author, Sofia, combined the group papers into a single collaborative paper. Over the course of the summer after the course, she whittled the big class paper down into a publishable review, which we submitted to PLoS NTD. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,



My name is Erin Mordecai and I am an Assistant Professor of Biology at Stanford University. My research focuses on the complex ways in which global change (including climate, land use, species invasions, etc.) influences infectious disease. I am joined by coauthors Jamieson O'Marr and Chris LeBoa. Jameison is a junior undergraduate majoring in biology at Stanford University, whose research interests involve using ecological methods to study and predict the spread of infectious disease. Chris is an undergraduate human biology major at Stanford University concentrating in disease ecology. His research focuses on using preventative strategies to reduce infectious disease risk.



We recently published a review paper titled ["Environmental and Social Change Drive the Explosive Emergence of Zika Virus in the Americas"](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005135 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=redditama-0222) in [PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds). This study was unusual in that it was written as a class project in my Stanford undergraduate seminar course, Bio 2N: Global Change and the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Disease.



We set out to explore all the ways in which global change may have fueled the emergence and spread of Zika virus in the Americas in the last two years. We found evidence for many factors at play, including poor housing and infrastructure, suitable climate, abundant mosquitoes that are well adapted to live and breed near humans, lapsed mosquito control, and global travel. For example, we found that Zika cases shot up in a province in Ecuador following a massive earthquake that destroyed housing and infrastructure. We also found that deforestation and low GDP both correlated with the number of Zika-linked microcephaly cases in Brazil. Because of the high suitability for mosquito transmission throughout much of the Americas (including parts of the southern US), we need to be much more vigilant about vector control and rapid public health responses to new emerging diseases.

And apologies for all the awesome people I forgot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Konrad** Attitudes are shifting extremely rapidly at the moment. Mostly driven by students who grew up with the open source movment/ open science/ open data mindset. I see a lot of old professors switching their opinions simply because their students insist. Look at the [yearly growth of biorxiv](https://twitter.com/lraffens/status/733669594829885441). Peer review is super useful. But the idea that the world should only see your papers after peer review is pretty pointless. In particular in a world where even after peer review many papers do not replicate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Konrad** EM techniques are awesome. However, so far, we know almost nothing about their relevance. How much of neural activity could we predict if we had all the connectomics? Unknown. But not any worse than the tuning curve mapping approaches. What we learn there we also do not know. So, we will have to see how we can use neuroscience to improve AI. My AI friends believe that we will solve strong AI **long** before we will solve the brain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Konrad** None of our theories are any good at predicting how the brain learns. Seriously. The best we have for describing actual learning are probably theories that do not even allude to brains, Bayesian theories that simply assume that people are good at solving their problems are pretty good. But when it comes to learning in the brain, I recently got very excited about using ideas for deep learning as components for a model of neural learning. We recently wrote a little [paper](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2016.00094/full) about that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Konrad** I just wanted to add that looking at Behavior only is not going to be good if what we want to explain is how the brain processes information on the inside. So I think that John Krakauer is a bit overly on the Behavior Chauvinism side. That being said, the neglect that neuroscience shows towards careful behavioral control is a huge problem. Our microprocessor lesioning studies would have been far more meaningful if we had the microprocessor spam the same command over and over, which would be more analogous to a well controlled behavior. One caveat may be that we simply do not know how to behaviorally produce the equivalent of spamming a single instruction with human beings. How can I prevent subjects from having any other thoughts in their heads? </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Eric:** I think that the rate of improvement in computational power is slowing (RIP Moore's law) and I think a lot of contemporary "advances in AI" are actually really overhyped -- we're getting much better at visual processing for some tasks, but in other areas things are much slower-going (I work in a ML group at Berkeley). 

I think connectomics is incredibly important because we really need authoritative neuroanatomy. I think there may be many early systems (sensory, motor) where we have many decades of theories and we just need the anatomy to help us pick which ones are right. But so many of the challenges with FiB-SEM actually boil down to data postprocessing -- how are we going to turn these petabytes of voxels into actual connectivity graphs without millions of man-years of human annotation? There I hope that advances in both compute and ML will make things better. 

I'm actually most enthusiastic about techniques that let you test specific behavioral hypotheses with cell-type specific targeting, like fiber photametry, in short periods of time (experiments that take hours, not weeks).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Konrad** Multiple people use this term under slightly different terms. I think using persistent homology to understand data can be an interesting step. However, I think that approach throws out the baby with the bathwater. A sphere has the same topology as a cube. And yet, if I have neural data, I would want to know which of the two it is. As such, I think that Topological Data analysis is an interesting method but that other methods, e.g. [structure discovery](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/31/10687.full) are more promising. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Konrad** the description is a bit cartoonish. But when it comes to the novel I would argue that [tDCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation) has often been shown to accelerate learning. Also, companies like [Kernel](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/08/15/putting-a-computer-in-your-brain-is-no-longer-science-fiction/?utm_term=.698c5c4032e1) and [Paradromics](https://paradromics.com/) are working towards interfacing with brains. Which could enable fast learning. Full disclosure, I consult for both of them. However, if there was a way of just speeding up learning with no downside, the brain would for sure have evolved that. Incidentally, we show that learning slowly may be optimal in many cases [here](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/Kording-Tenenbaum-Shadmehr-07.pdf). So if there are ways of letting humans learn faster, there is probably a price to be paid (e.g. very slow forgetting of everything you ever learned in your life). </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Eric:** I started off in a tetrode electrophysiology lab where, at the time, we were getting 100 simultaneous cells in the hippocampus -- this seemed like an incredible number! Now, with two photon, light sheet, and other technologies, it _feels_ like we can do much better. But can we? Deep structures in the brain, which might be more amenable to computational analysis, are still hard to record from. Many of these imaging techniques can only pull out superficial cortical layers, although that's improving as well. And of course, most of our optical techniques are looking at calcium signals, not actual membrane voltage. I think we need to go deeper, both in terms of deeper structures and in terms of even cortical acquisition. Some of [our recent microscopy work](http://ericjonas.com/pages/phase_scattering.html) tries to move in this direction, but it's difficult! 

Conceptually, I think a big problem is thinking of these things as an encoding problem -- from stimulus to response, without algorithmic models of the underlying behavioral task. You say that a microprocessor has a limited range of behavior, but they are Turing complete, so they could do anything! It's true that the tiny microprocessor we examined had limited complexity and a limited set of behaviors -- in that sense, it may have been much more like _C. elegans_ than a mouse or a human. I think the biggest problem in lesioning more complex organisms is the incredible plasticity and functional recovery we see in neural systems -- for which there is no known analog in the microprocessor.  </TEXT>

(1) We are very advanced at understanding how the brain works.
(2) Attaching the allusion to neuroscientific ideas strengthens a behavioral finding
(3) Functional connectivity/ granger causality/ DCM/ measure something of causal meaning, e.g. actual interactions
(4) Having a list of all the brain areas and what leads to activity is a big step towards understanding the brain (it is enabling other things but not directly an understanding)

<TEXT> **Eric**: I think behavior is absolutely crucial, and love the  Krakauer paper. In our paper we make reference to [David Marr's levels of analysis ](http://blog.shakirm.com/2013/04/marrs-levels-of-analysis/) for understanding the brain: 

* **computational** : At this level we describe and specify the problems we are faced with in a generic manner, but do not say how these problems are to be solved. Do we aim to learn a function? Do we wish to estimate uncertainty?
* **Algorithmic** : This level forms a bridge between the computational and implementational levels, describing how  the identified computational problems can be solved. It is here that Bayesian and machine learning methods find their place.
* **Implementaitonal** : The physical substrate or mechanism, and its organisation, in which computation is performed. This could be biological in the case of neurons and synapses, or in silicon using transistors, etc.

(Text from the linked to blog) 

I think understanding the computational level -- that is, formal descriptions of behavior and the underlying computation that the behavior is performing -- is too often made a second-class citizen in neuroscience. For primary sensory physiology (early audition and vision) this might be ok, but for more complex behavioral processes it's quite problematic. But I think the computational cognitive science approaches of Josh Tenenbaum (MIT) and Tom Griffiths (Berkeley) might point us in the right direction.

What else? Become good at writing (I tried to write some hints here: [ten simple rules for structuring papers](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/28/088278).

<TEXT> **Eric**: The feedback has ranged from I thought about doing this experiment years ago! (high praise) to this paper has simply shown you are a bad experimentalist (Sad!) . Many of the members of the community I have talked to agree with our criticism of methods A, B, and D, but think we are unfair to method C -- where C happens to be the method they use. That always makes me laugh! 

Neuroscientists study neural systems at different levels. Some study individual molecules inside cells, some study whole cells, some study small networks of cells, some study brain regions, and some study the entire brain. Often, we pick a level to study because we think the details below are less important, and everything above is too hand-waiving or uninterpretable with current methods and knowledge. So there is a lot of internal criticism in the field to start.

<TEXT> **Eric**: We come from similar backgrounds, this has basically been my reaction as well. One thing that the paper really made clear to me is that, while the acquire all the data and hope the algorithms can figure it out approach seems doomed to failure, we really do need to step up our acquisition technology. These days I spend a lot of my time working on computational imaging for neural data, and Konrad similarly has various high-throughput acquisition projects. So we still need big, authoritative data -- its surprising how much disagreement there still is about fundamental neuroanatomy! 

I think we also need to try and tighten the experimental loop so we can more quickly ask questions and reject erroneous hypotheses. Techniques like [fiber photometry](http://clarityresourcecenter.com/fiberphotometry.html) are not big data but they do let you very rapidly ask very specific questions of neural systems, especially of deeper structures which might be easier to understand. 

And I think that anyone doing systems neuroscience and above should study some computer science, especially theory of computation. I had one neuroscientist ask in a talk how I could possibly make the comparison to a microprocessor, considering the brain did fundamentally different things like emotion and affect. He did not have any patience for my arguments that those also were a form of computation. 

**Konrad**: I think it could help to focus more on ideas than about their endless replication. Measuring tuning curves is great. Even calculating granger causality is great. But scaling them up (thousands of labs doing basically the same thing in slightly different settings) before we understand what they mean is a problem. Same thing for neurotechnology. Develop methods that acquire large datasets about anatomy or physiology is great. Applying one of them to the whole brain is less interesting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Konrad**: When people say connectomics, it feels causal. A connection after all is a wire from one place to another (and arguably EM connectomics gets at that http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8923?WT.ec_id=NCOMMS-20150805 spMailingID=49252352 spUserID=NDkwMjM5MzE2MwS2 spJobID=740779497 spReportId=NzQwNzc5NDk3S0). Anyone speaking plain English thinks of connectomics in causal terms.

However, as we know, it is very hard to get at causality from observational data. I.e. it is crazy hard to understand causality in the brain if you just record. In fact, the problem is so bad that economists write amazing papers about it. And they did work at better methods (see Taking the con out of Economics discussed in http://www.nber.org/papers/w15794). 

So, statisticians using connectomics on typical fMRI, LFP, MEG, or spike data are not even pretending. Connections are *defined* as certain kinds of statistical regularities. However, this does not need to mean anything about the actual causality in the system. From my own work we have some evidence:
The problem is complicated and we wrote a review about those problems:
[review of functional connectivity methods] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2706692/). I want to note that back then I still loved the idea. Maybe too much.
Granger causality should not work for slow signals: [this](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009206)
Functional connectivity on spikes from simulated neurons fails:
[here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2936935/)
And obviously we fail at understanding the microprocessor.

So I think we have a serious social problem there. Everyone working on statistics (functional connectivity) knows that they are not talking about causal connections and is happy about the popularity of the field. Everyone outside the field, in particular the experimentalists, are very happy interpreting the results as causality. In fact, I believe that every single experimentalist I ever talked functional connectomics with wants to interpret the results as causal. I am planning to write a review paper soon addressing this mismatch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Eric**: Hi Memming! I think its an interesting question if randomness and noise would make a system easier or harder to understand. You are correct that the processor looks much more deterministic than a brain, but for many of the techniques we applied (spectral analysis, dimensionality reduction, lesioning) there is no reason to assume that stochasticity make them work better or worse. Its entirely true that some methods which assume a large degree of underlying stochasticity wouldnt work terribly well, but we mostly avoided those. 

We need to remember that many of the techniques we use in neuroscience, ranging from Fourier transforms and spectral analysis to generalized linear models, were not invented _for_ neuroscience. While many of the techniques currently used to understand digital computers assume a certain level of determinism, it may be the case that stochastic relaxations are applicable. 

**Konrad**: Who says that the brain is noisy? A system that you do not understand will always look noisy because everything that you can not explain is by definition called noise.

Neuroscience, just like psychology and other disciplines is having a statistical crisis where papers often do not replicate (see the [open science project] (https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home/) ). But isnt it amazing that we have such a strong push now towards fixing these problems? On the other hand, it is hard to do science if you believe that about half of the research may not replicate. What do you believe then? We used to believe that conceptual replication could save us.

<TEXT> **Eric**: Ok, this is a great question. I think there are a few important points to consider: 


First, what does understanding one type of neural system let us conclude about other neural systems? You are correct that, in many ways, starting with a simpler organism like c. elegans seems more tractable. And indeed, the history of all of neuroscience is full of exciting discoveries from model systems, including how nerve impulses are conducted (work in the 50s on the squid giant axon), the nature of early visual processing (Hubel / Weisel, 60s), and on. We have elucidated a lot of basics about how neural systems seem to work from model organisms, which apply to more complex animals, and ultimately humans. 

Plus, a lot of human neuroscience isnt studying a whole human brain -- most of the technologies we have to acquire neural data dont work on humans, often because they damage the organism, and obviously thats suboptimal for human research. 

Secondly, though, is the question of why are we funding science? The NIHs budget is ~$32B/year, and the NSFs budget is $8B/year. I often think of that $24B gap as the amount society is willing to pay for research that will potentially have clinical impact. And as I say often when I give a talk about this work, it may not be the case that any real level of computational understanding is necessary to have clinically meaningful impact. A large number of neuropsychiatric drugs are tremendously effective, and thats in spite of us not really understanding any circuit-level mechanisms of action. As a result, it may be that more macro, human-focused research might yield clinical impact. 

That said, we also know that often animal models dont generalize terribly well for clinical evaluation. Medical chemist Derek Lowe often writes about [just how wrong many animal models can be](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/23/just-how-worthless-are-the-standard-alzheimers-models)  for evaluating whether or not a given treatment will work in human populations. . This may suggest that, from a clinical perspective, studying simpler organisms might not help as much as wed like. 


**Konrad**: great question. We do not currently understand the worm. And we have learned that it is crazy hard to understand. If the mammalian brain is that complicated then we can expect a hard time ahead. Many neuroscientists implicitly assume that the mammalian brain is *way* easier than the worm nervous system. Some people  say that the mammalian nervous system solves general purpose computing (which they believe to be simple). And that the worm is specialized and hence complex. Other people may say that this believe is primarily held to avoid having to confront the hard questions.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit!

We are Eric Jonas (a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) and Konrad Kording (Professor at Northwestern and RIC). Our research focuses on trying to understand how the neurons in the brain compute and give rise to behavior. A lot of what we do is come up with mathematical techniques to understand neural data and work on new methods to acquire this data.

We recently published a paper titled [Could a neuroscientist understand a microprocessor?](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=redditama-0215) that tried to address if the analysis methods we frequently use in neuroscience are likely to provide the level of understanding we seek. One of the biggest challenges facing neuroscience is that we dont actually know ahead of time how neural systems work, so validating analysis techniques can be a catch-22. We attempted to use these techniques on a microprocessor -- a system we understand really well -- to see if we could make sense of how it works. This ended up being quite difficult, and we suggest ways that we might move forward as a community to make sure our analysis methods really do what we hope they will.

Our study  has also been written up in the popular press. Read the articles in [Arstechnica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/01/can-modern-neuroscience-understand-donkey-kong/) and [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21714978-cautionary-tale-about-promises-modern-brain-science-tests-suggest)) to learn more.

<TEXT> Privacy laws here are of great importance. Any information provided to the NYC public health department is protected by New York State law. These data cannot be shared with law enforcement, etc. Even with this protection, many people still refuse to interact with the Department of Health for various reasons (including that of privacy).

Outside of New York, this issue becomes much thornier, since unintentional HIV transmission is still a crime in many jurisdictions. It is great concern among many researchers in this field that our work could be used to prosecute individuals. That being said, the type of data analyzed here are NOT sufficient to establish transmission between two people. All we can say using these genetic sequence data is that two people are infected with viruses that are similar enough to suggest a direct or indirect epidemiological connection. There could be intermediate or shared sources of infection that we cannot rule out using surveillance data.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, BC is doing some excellent work on incorporating these types of approaches into their surveillance activities. They are the leaders in the field.

Here in the US, we are already incorporating the findings from this study in public health practice: monitoring cluster growth and directing public health services to genetically linked people in clusters.  

The questions I want to address next is can we use HIV genetic sequences to identify transmission clusters of greatest public concern? And can we direct resources (linkage to care, antiretroviral treatment support, partner notification services) towards these clusters to slow (stop) their growth?

My group is currently working on addressing both of these questions. </TEXT>

By looking at a highly conserved region of the genome (where most mutations aren't tolerated because they render the virus non-functional), we can reconstruct the evolutionary history of the virus.

<TEXT> I believe you're referring to the CCR5-delta32 mutation. In some people, a cell receptor (CCR5) on their CD4-helper T-cells is missing 32 nucleotides due to a deletion. HIV can use typically CCR5 to gain access to these cells, but not if these 32 nucleotides are missing. 

There have been many theories as to why CCR5-delta32 exists at such high frequency in humans (particularly Northern Europeans): plague, smallpox, etc. I'm not convinced by any one theory yet. The timing and geography just doesn't fit.

And no, my research doesn't overlap with this topic. But I do find it fascinating.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is an extraordinary amount of variation in the HIV genome. In fact, within a single person infected with HIV, there is typically more genetic variation than is found in influenza circulating the globe in a given year. This variation occurs across the entire genome, and is greatest in the envelope proteins, which evolve to avoid detection by the host's immune system. 

There is quite a lively debate in the HIV research community right now about much this genetic variation affects infectivity potential (i.e. the concentration of virus in blood). It seems as if there is a relationship. However, it is an complicated relationship. And there aren't clear mutation-phenotype relationships when it comes to infectivity.

Other viral genetic features such as cell-tropism (which cells can HIV bind to and infect) and drug resistance have much clearer genetic underpinnings. And these types of mutations are often monitored quite closely.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Excellent question! The region of the HIV genome that we used here is about 1200 nucleotides long. And there are four possible states at each site (A,C,U,G)  U instead of T because HIV is an RNA virus. That means that HIV evolution doesn't occur in a linear fashion, but rather like a (multidimensional) tree. The same mutation can occur along different branches in a tree, but there are often so many other mutations that even with this occasional convergence, the sequences will never look identical again.

That being said, HIV is a peculiar virus, and there is some work suggesting that this convergent evolution is happening more often that we would otherwise expect. But once sequences are diverged, they won't look the same again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This study was conducted on existing public health data collected by the NYC-Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). So my group was not involved in the elicitation of sexual/drug-using partner names. That being said, when people are asked for these names, they provide on average only 0.5 partners. Partner elicitation is certainly a sensitive topic, and based on that average, most people do not name any partners. 

One important finding of our study is that, even in the absence of partner naming, we can use these genetic sequences to better understand transmission dynamics. And we can query someone's HIV genetic sequence against all other people in the database, looking for evidence of an epidemiological connection.

To answer your second question, NYC and primary care provides use drug resistance profiles (captured in these genetic sequences) to modify treatment regimes. This was (and still is) the primary purpose of collecting these genotypes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,
 

My name is Joel Wertheim and I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego. My research focuses on the molecular evolution of RNA viruses, like HIV. In my [lab](http://id.ucsd.edu/faculty/wertheim.shtml), I am particularly interested in figuring out how to translate insights from HIV evolutionary biology into practical public health action.
 

We recently published a study [Social and Genetic Networks of HIV-1 Transmission in New York City]( http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006000 utm_source=ama utm_medium=reddit utm_campaign=amareddit-0208) in PLOS Pathogens. In this [study](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006000 utm_source=ama utm_medium=reddit utm_campaign=amareddit-0208) we asked HIV-infected individuals to name their sexual partners and injection drug-using partners. When these partners were also infected with HIV, we investigated whether their viruses were genetically similar enough to support a shared transmission history. Our findings suggest that incorporating HIV genetic sequence data can improve public health activities.
 

I will be answering your questions at 1pm ET  Ask Me Anything! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


My name is Gene Richardson and I am and infectious disease physician and anthropologist at [Brigham and Womens Hospital](http://www.brighamandwomens.org/) and [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/). I use biosocial approaches to conduct research on infectious disease epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa.



I recently published an article titled [Minimally Symptomatic Infection in an Ebola Hotspot: A Cross-Sectional Serosurvey](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005087 utm_source=ama utm_medium=reddit utm_campaign=amareddit-0201) in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. The study provides further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection. The findings also suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the recent outbreak in West Africa.

<TEXT> Actually there weren't too many experimental difficulties... the nice thing about such behavioural work is that it's easy to see what works and what doesn't, so the feedback loops are quick: if a technique doesn't work, you see it right away. That leaves lots of room for creativity. Anyone can do such experiments - you just need ideas. In terms of technology, these experiments could have been done 100 years ago. I'm happy that in this post-genomic age, where fancy and expensive technology is often fetishized, we can still do our work with a bit of plywood, cardboard, glass and some live animals.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had been thinking about human cultural processes for a number of years, and wondering whether they really are as unique as they're made out to be. I remember sending an email message, some years ago, to the 1st author Sylvain Alem, saying if we can demonstrate  something as unusual as string-pulling in the bumblebee, and find that it spreads by social learning, well have something really interesting. I also said that its very unlikely to work But fortunately Sylvain was happy to take that risk, and in collaboration with Clint Perry, they designed the paradigm and found quite quickly that indeed bees could be trained to solve the string-pulling task.  That was by all means a big surprise, even though we must all have had an inkling that it wasnt entirely hopeless  otherwise we wouldnt have tried. But it was even more of a surprise that not only could bees be trained to solve this task in a step-by-step manner  but a small minority of bees actually solved the task by themselves, without gradual training or observing a skilled bee. 110 nave individuals were given the opportunity to solve the task of their own accord; each of them were given 2 trials. Two of the 110 bees managed the task on their second attempt. While these two were clumsy and inefficient at solving the task, it showed that through persistent exploration and trial and error, some individual bees could actually solve the task by themselves. The final big surprise came in the context of social learning: we discovered that nave individuals that would observe, from a distance, a skilled string-pulling bee, could subsequently solve the task by themselves. But we really didn't know that any of this would work when we started... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good point - all animals are of course better at learning tasks that are closer to what they encounter in their natural environments. Bees are much faster at learning colours than cats for example - and that's because for bees (but not cats), colours play an important role in their daily activities of visiting flowers. -- In this particular case, we deliberately chose a task that is relatively far removed from bees' natural activities - we wanted to push them to their intellectual limits a bit! :-)  There may, under some cases, be tasks that are somewhat similar, though: e.g. bees might sometimes have to pull debris out of their nest, for example. But this is still quite far from pulling on a string with the explicit purpose of obtaining a sugar reward.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much! It's not straightforward to make a link between an animal's intelligence and their ability to cope with global warming, though. Many species of bees are already under stress from habitat loss (meaning the loss of suitable flowers as well as nesting sites), pesticides, and diseases. Global warming will likely add to this, since more arid conditions mean fewer flowers in many habitats, etc. What's a bee to do, even an intelligent bee...? It's clear that a bee species that is narrowly specialised on particular flower species (and can't easily learn to exploit other species)  will be in big trouble if it has to move north because of climate change, if that flower species is not available there. But generalists such as most bumblebees might do better, since they can learn to exploit new flower species (though they wouldn't have to pull strings for that...)  -- As for your second question, we have not done such an experiment, but I suspect that direct observation is necessary for the skill to be passed on. That said, Martin Lindauer did some work where he trained bees to forage at certain times of day, then raised the larvae from such colonies ("early or late risers") in isolation and then placed them in new colonies. The bees hatching from the larvae then were early (or late) risers as well! When they were larvae, they might have picked up the timing from dancing bees that were vibrating the comb as they danced.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on the species... there are about 300 species of bumblebees globally. Some species are already extinct locally and possibly globally; many more are under threat. A few species seem robust in most regions, and indeed some are spreading in habitats where they are not native, since they have been introduced by humans for commercial pollination purposes. Fortunately, in addition to nudging policy makers, there something that everyone can do to help ailing pollinator populations: to plant flowers that benefit bees (rather than ornamental flowers that have no value to pollinators). There is some useful information about which flowers to plant here: http://www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/goulsonlab/resources/flowers and here: https://www.savelondonbees.co.uk/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there - no, the dance communication system is unique to honeybees, whereas these experiments were done with bumblebees. While the dance "language" in bees is unique and extremely impressive, it has only relative few "words" - bees only communicate about the distance and direction of a food source from the hive, and the quality of the food. They cannot inform other bees about things other than location - so they cannot "talk" about the colour of flowers, or indeed complex tricks such as how to pull a string. The bumblebees in our study learned this  without the experienced string-pullers making an active investment into passing on the technique. The learners just "scrounged" on the information provided, by observing the skilled individuals.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There isn't a single, easy explanation. In some cases, it looks as if in insects, single neurons can take on the tasks that are mediated by 1000s of neurons in vertebrates. For example, Martin Hammer discovered a neuron that, all on its own, appears to constitute the olfactory reward pathway in bees (whereas in the mammalian dopaminergic reward system, there may be 1000s of neurons involved in this task. In other cases, there may be multi-tasking of single circuits in multiple tasks in the insect nervous system (see e.g. Niven, J.E.   Chittka, L. (2010). Reuse of identied neurons in multiple neural circuits Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 33: 4). In yet other cases, seemingly complex abilities might be mediated very simple neural connectivities (e.g. Peng F.   Chittka L. (2017) A Simple Computational Model of the Bee Mushroom Body Can Explain Seemingly Complex Forms of Olfactory Learning and Memory. Current Biology 27(2): 224-230). In terms of at least some forms of social learning, there might not be such a fundamental difference between vertebrates and invertebrates. Cecelia Heyes, for example, has made the point that many forms of social learning hinge on relatively simple forms of associative learning that are just co-opted into social processes in some animals.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on how you define coolness... :-) There are many - in addition to the remarkable learning abilities, there are their strange sensory worlds - the fact that bees can see ultraviolet and polarised light for example, and use this for identifying flowers and navigating securely over many miles from their hive. One important difference between bumblebees and honeybees is that only the latter have a "language" - the "waggle dance" - a symbolic code by which they can tell each other, in the darkness of the hive, about the precise location of a rich flower patch they have discovered. No other animal (humans aside) has such a code, and bumblebees don't either (they just have a chaotic "slam dance" by which they alert other bees to the current availability of food, without passing on the coordinates). What is perhaps even cooler is the fact that honeybees use this dance communication system in a consensus building process when a swarm decides on a new location to live in. There's initially a lot of disagreement between scouts, but ultimately everyone in the swarm agrees on one destination. The process if described beautifully in Tom Seeley's book "Honeybee democracy".  </TEXT>

Darwin already suggested that honeybees could copy from bumblebees the technique of nectar-robbing (where bumblebees bite holes into the spurs of flowers as a shortcut to the nectar, and honeybees then use the flowers). We haven't experimentally tested whether this is true, though bumblebees can certainly learn from honeybees where to find the most rewarding flowers: Dawson, E.H.   Chittka, L. (2012).

<TEXT> Sure! One observation is that some individual bees are always exceptionally smart. Some years ago we did an experiment that required us catching the bees in black film canisters on every departure and return to their nest (to weigh them). Most bees initially resisted, but eventually got used to it. One bee, however, learned to fly straight into the black container, even if we held it in the air several meters from the nest, and expected us to transport her back to the nest. -- In another experiment, I kept a bumblebee colony in a greenhouse. The greenhouse was sealed tight, since I wanted all the experience to occur with just the artificial flowers I had set up in the greenhouse. However, a few bees eventually came back with pollen from natural flowers - and I found out that they had discovered a drainage hole in the floor of the greenhouse, walked through a drainage pipe for about 2m, and then emerged on the other side to look for natural flowers. -- Wasps are very smart, too! On one occasion, one of my team members trained a honeybee to locate the correct visual pattern in a Y-maze, and a social wasp came along too. The wasp learned the task faster and also learned to exit the lab faster than the bee. And in the end the wasp killed the bee and then had the setup to itself... - I'll pass on the greetings! :-)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very interesting question! Certainly generalist bees (such as honeybees and most bumblebees) that naturally visit a wide range of flowers, and arrive at their favoured ones by learning which are the most rewarding ones, are relatively well equipped to benefit from exotic flowers. But since, as you say, there may be only relatively few stands of some of these plants in any one garden, this will certainly keep bees on their toes, and in some cases force them to multi-task and visit multiple flower species (that may all differ in colour pattern, scent, and the particular motor patterns required to harvest pollen or nectar). We do know that bees need to learn the techniques to harvest pollen efficiently: Raine, N.E.   L Chittka. (2007). Pollen foraging: learning a complex motor skill by bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Naturwissenschaften, 94: 459-464, but we don't yet know if a fine-motor skill like this can be learned socially from other bees. Some techniques, however, are certainly copied, for example nectar robbing, where bees 'steal' nectar from long-tubed flowers by biting holes into the tubes - Darwin already suspected that bees might learn this from other bees, and here it is confirmed: Leadbeater, E.   Chittka L. (2008). Social transmission of nectar-robbing behaviour in bumble-bees. Proc. R. Soc. B, 275: 1669-1674. So while it's not certain whether skill transfer is more in demand in urban areas, you are quite right that the small size and diversity of flower supplies may place higher demands on the learning skill of urban bees. This could be tested both by observing how many species of plants are typically visited in urban versus rural or natural habitats, and also by testing the learning skills of urban versus natural pollinators in the laboratory.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's an interesting question... but I'm sure that bees would pick up on this change very quickly. They are generally very good at figuring out the quickest path to a reward, especially if the task is easy (just landing on an open accessible flower). If however, we presented the bees with artificial flowers under a glass table, but without a string, they would certainly spend a great deal of time rummaging about at the edge of the glass table in an attempt to look for the string. And bees are certainly creatures of habit: for example, in one experiment, when we moved a flower that bees had visited multiple times, we found that bees would visit the learned location again and again, even after multiple failed attempts: Lihoreau, M.D., Raine, N.E., Reynolds, A.M., Stelzer, R.J., Lim, K.S., Smith, A.D., Osborne, J.L.

<TEXT> Change was part of the training procedure for many bees. Only two individuals solved the task spontaneously, without any stepwise training or observation of skilled bees. For the others, we trained them by gradually changing the difficulty of the task. At first, flowers were completely 'open access', then they were partially hidden under the glass table, then completely pushed under the table. Bees cope very well with this sort of change, where tasks change only moderately and difficulty increases slowly. A trick to put animals on the spot is a so called reversal learning test, where they have to learn that the opposite of what they previously learnt is now true. So for example, in one phase, blue flowers are rewarding and yellow ones are not, and after bees have learnt this, you switch the contingencies around. This can be very confusing for bees, especially if you reverse the associations several times. But if you do it multiple times, bees will pick up on the schedule on 'learn to reverse learn' very quickly.  </TEXT>

I had always been working on bee learning and memory, and I guess there is a perception among my colleagues working on larger-brained animals that all the behaviour complexity we see in bees, impressive though it may be, is largely based on instinct. While bee researchers had long known that bees learn the location of their hive and flowers, as well as the colours and patterns of flowers (etc - all of this is not just sensory-driven but requires learning),  there was a challenge for me:  I asked what may have seemed an entirely mad question when we first started  could we get our small-brained bees to solve tasks that might impress e.g. a bird cognition researcher? Could we find some individual bees that would innovate and solve a difficult puzzle, and could these techniques spread through a bee population in a similar manner as in human cultural evolution, by more and more individuals copying the technique? The bigger-picture goal, though, is to explore just how much cognition you can achieve with how small a brain. This will give us information about the minimal neural circuits for any particular learning task, and how circuits in miniature brains can effectively multi-task to juggle a large number of behavioural skills.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Lars Chittka and I am a professor of sensory and behavioural ecology at Queen Mary University of London. My research focuses on the learning processes, the sensory organs and the social behaviour of bees, and their interactions with flowers.

I recently published a study titled ["Associative Mechanisms Allow for Social Learning and Cultural Transmission of String Pulling in an Insect"](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002564) in PLOS Biology. In this study, we discovered that bumblebees can solve a string-pulling puzzle, where they had to pull on a thread to retrieve a reward from an artificial flowers that was presented under a glass table, so that bees could see it but not reach without pulling the thread. Moreover, we found that inexperienced bees could learn the technique from experienced ones, so that the skill spread rapidly to a majority of colony members, in a manner similar to the cultural spread of new innovations found in humans.

I will be answering your questions at 1pm ET -- Ask Me Anything!

<TEXT> Joel: Thanks for your question. I definitely anticipate that in the future, we will think of autism as many different but related disorders. To stratify autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we need biomarkers that relate to disease mechanisms. In this study, we have identified an EEG signature that likely relates to the overexpression of GABA_A receptor subunit genes that are duplicated in Dup15q syndrome. Other individuals with autism might have more subtle aberrations of GABA_A receptors, such as point mutations. They might also have a more subtle form of this EEG signature. By relating this and other biomarkers to various causal mechanisms, we can move towards an understanding of autism that is rooted in distinct mechanisms with distinct treatments.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Joel: Id like to add that autism is, in a sense, really dozens of different disorders. The reason that Aspergers and autism were consolidated into autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was because there is so much heterogeneity within this spectrum that no one knows where to draw a meaningful line. Yes, I absolutely expect that we are going to find quantifiable, biological differences between different forms of ASD, and one of the goals of biomarkers is to stratify ASD into meaningful subgroups.

One reason we focus on Dup15q syndrome is because we already know the genes involved, so it is likely more tractable to treat. There are many, many genes involved in autism. Some forms of autism are caused by copy number variants like Dup15q, where deletions or duplications of a handful of genes have a large clinical impact. Other forms of autism are also caused by mutations in a few important genes. But very commonly, autism is driven by many different mutations in one person, each mutation individually having a modest impact. The sum of all these mutation, though, may converge on autism. 

So returning more to your question, we are starting with the most tractable forms of ASD with the goal of eventually being able to understand the heterogeneity within the spectrum and to offer treatments for as many of these different clinical subgroups as possible.

<TEXT> Joel: Thanks for your question. Some genes duplicated in this syndrome, such as [GABRA5]( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892036216301210) and [UBE3A]( http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/3/103/103ra97.short), cause autism-like behaviors when their expression is disrupted in animals. Obviously, we cant do the same experiment in humans where we change gene expression and observe behavioral effects. But the whole logic of treatments that target proteins encoded these genes would be that they are causing the disorder. 

What we still need to learn is *which* specific genes in 15q11.2-13.1 are responsible for *which* symptoms. Most of the research has focused on UBE3A, which is also deleted in Angelman Syndrome, but I think the role of the duplicated genes encoding GABA_A receptor subunits has been under-emphasized. The fact that the EEG signature we've described looks so much like what is seen in drugs that modulate GABA_A receptors suggests that they might be important, but the exact relationship between these GABA_A receptor genes and autism or intellectual disability is uncertain.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Charlotte:  Your first question has been covered in a couple of other replies, so I'll just answer the others. :)

Yes, lots of exciting research happening in the ASD world!  Here's a nice summary that Spectrum put together.  https://spectrumnews.org/features/special-reports/2016-year-review/   I think we're developing a much better understanding of the heterogeneity within ASD, which is hopefully going to improve our ability to target interventions and really improve outcomes for individuals with ASD.  

In terms of better understanding ASD, I think the most important thing is to be aware that it's a large and diverse spectrum.  It's diagnosed based on broad categories of symptoms (e.g. impairments in social communication, the presence of repetitive behaviors and restricted interests), but how those symptoms manifest is extremely variable.  The one stereotype that I'd love to change is the idea that children with ASD don't like social contact, or aren't affectionate.  Individuals with ASD often have difficulty with social interaction, but can still be very interested in being with people!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Charlotte: Great question!  Yes, there are lots of things that can contribute to the EEG signal.  For that reason, research generally tries to be pretty rigorous about the participants who are included - we want to avoid as many confounds as possible.  In our studies, we generally exclude any participants who have had significant neglect/abuse in early childhood (e.g. were adopted from an orphanage), have sensory impairments (significant vision/hearing loss), or had birth trauma.  We also carefully document seizures and medications, since those can affect the EEG signal as well.  It's not perfect, but we do our best to disentangle all of these potential confounds from the variables that we're actually interested in (in this case, genetic diagnosis). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Charlotte:  That's a good question.  You're correct that within the ASD population, epilepsy is associated with intellectual disability.  However, individuals with more "mild" ASD also have rates of epilepsy that are higher than the general population.  A meta-analysis from 2008 found that among individuals with ASD who do not have intellectual disability ("high-functioning", although I don't like that term), 8% had epilepsy.  That's a lower rate than in kids with ASD and intellectual disability, but much higher than the general population (.5%).  

Given that ASD is such a heterogeneous condition, it's likely that different genetic and biological mechanisms contribute to the very different characteristics that we see.   </TEXT>

As measured here, its smeared across the scalp. Any guesses about cellular mechanisms would be highly speculative at this point, so theres a lot of exciting research to be done.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Joel: Great point, beta is very broad, usually defined as 12-30 cycles per second or Hz. In this case, the signature was strongest toward the higher frequency end of the beta band (sometimes called beta2), with a peak around 23 Hz, which you can see [here]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=large id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167179.g004). The beta finding was very diffuse across the scalp, but strongest in frontotemporal regions. We also observed lower delta (1-4 Hz) activity in the children with Dup15q syndrome, which is interesting because patients with deletions of the same region actually have elevated delta activity. 

We have yet to correlate this biomarker with autism severity or ADOS subscores, but that is an exciting direction for this work. In this paper, though, we did show that the EEG biomarker is associated with epilepsy. 

Glad that youre excited about our work! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Joel: Thanks, this is a great question. We think that this EEG signature would be a very promising measure of target engagement in future clinical trials. In other words, by measuring this biomarker, we could perhaps infer whether a drug is actually engaging the GABA_A receptors that the treatment is targeting. Furthermore, because physiological changes should precede behavioral changes, we could use this biomarker to perhaps tell whether neural circuit changes are occurring, even if the trial does not last long enough to see the behavioral changes that might take much longer to observe.

An important next step, of course, is to do preclinical work in animal models of Dup15q syndrome that will correlate this EEG biomarker with GABA_A receptor subunit gene expression. We also want to correlate the EEG biomarker with clinical traits in humans with the disorder. By learning what clinical traits the biomarker is possibly associated with, we will know what aspects of the disorder might be improved by a treatment that alters this EEG biomarker.

<TEXT> Charlotte:  Thanks for your question!  In order to improve treatments for ASD, we really need a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the deficits we observe.  Right now, our treatments are based on behavioral symptoms.  E.g., a child has a difficult time with social interactions, so we do social skills intervention to try to improve their social abilities.  While this works great for some kids, unfortunately it doesn't help us understand why some kids DON'T make a lot of progress with intervention, and what we could be doing differently with them.  Although one genetic disorder only accounts for a small percentage of cases of ASD, research like this helps us understand what some of the neurobiological mechanisms might be that underly the deficits we observe.  That in turn will help us understand why we see so much variability in terms of children's development and response to intervention, and will hopefully help us develop and target interventions that will work best for specific children.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great question. EEG signatures that are as clear as what we see in Dup15q syndrome are very rare. It is likely that children with other forms of autism have EEG features that would be useful as biomarkers, but they are probably much more subtle.

Its hard to talk about a normal EEG because there are different ways of analyzing EEG. Clinical EEGs are read qualitatively and examined for unusual activity. Research EEGs are more often quantitative EEG (qEEG), which is analyzed digitally with a specific hypothesis in mind (like what we did in this study). Many researchers examine the EEG frequency spectrum using Fourier transform to look for abnormal EEG oscillations, for example. A growing trend in the field is also to examine the complexity of the EEG signal, for which there are many measures. For instance, [this study]( https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-9-18) was able to distinguish infant boys at high and low risk for autism using EEG complexity as measured by multiscale entropy.
 
In terms of clinical EEG findings, about 20% of children with ASD have epilepsy (at least two unprovoked seizures), and abnormal EEGs are reported in up to 50%.  Abnormal EEG in this case just means that there was something unusual noted on the childs clinical EEG, so its not just one specific signature.  We dont have a great understanding yet of what this high rate of abnormal EEG means, especially since it varies so widely across individuals.
 
So to answer your follow-up: many children with autism do not have a clear or overt EEG signature, but this likely means that we need more innovative techniques for unlocking the information in the EEG signal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Charlotte: Estimates vary a little bit, but about 75% of individuals with dup15q syndrome have ASD.  The characteristics associated with dup15q vary quite a bit.  In addition to ASD, we most commonly see intellectual disability, epilepsy and motor impairments.  However, this can range from a relatively mild impairment to individuals who have significant delays all areas of development (e.g. don't develop spoken language).  We recently published a paper looking at the clinical characteristics of children with dup15q syndrome, and how they compare to a sample of children with non-syndromic ASD.  In our sample all of the children with dup15q met criteria for ASD on a common diagnostic assessment (the ADOS), but our sample likely skewed a little bit to the more impacted end just due to the nature of kids we see in our clinic.  You can read more here if you're interested!  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27158270

In response to your last question, dup15q syndrome is generally maternally derived.  It doesn't appear that paternal inheritance leads to the disorder, although it's possible that the paternally derived duplication leads to an extremely mild phenotype that just isn't ever diagnosed because there aren't any noticeable impairments.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess the obvious question is, are there good inverse agonists of the GABA-A receptor and have they been tried in Dup15q syndrome?

Great question, we are considering exploring something along these lines.

Further, which alpha subunits do you think are most relevant to Dup15q?

GABRA5, which encodes the alpha5 subunit, is duplicated in Dup15q syndrome.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Joel Frohlich and I am a neuroscience PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the lab of Dr. Shafali Jeste. My research uses brain waves or [neural oscillations]( http://knowingneurons.com/2016/05/18/brain-waves/) to identify quantitative, biological markers (biomarkers) of autism and neurodevelopmental disorders. These biomarkers can be used to guide treatment or inform outcomes in patients. Our lab places electrodes on the scalp to measure neural oscillations in children, a technique known as EEG.

My name is Charlotte DiStefano and I am a postdoctoral fellow and clinical instructor at UCLA. My research focuses on cognitive and language development in children with neurodevelopment disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and related neurogenetic disorders.

We recently published a paper titled [A Quantitative Electrophysiological Biomarker of Duplication 15q11.2-q13.1 Syndrome]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167179) in [PLOS ONE]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/). Dup15q syndrome is a neurogenetic disorder caused by partial duplications of chromosome 15. It is one of the most common [genetic duplications]( http://knowingneurons.com/2016/09/21/copy-number-variants/) that causes autism spectrum disorder, and it also confers high risk for epilepsy (i.e., seizures) and intellectual disability (ID). We used EEG to measure a particular frequency of neural oscillation called beta in children with Dup15q syndrome and found that *beta oscillations distinguish children with the disorder from other children with autism and ID, as well as healthy children*. Remarkably, *this EEG signature looks just like the EEG signature seen when a person takes benzodiazepine drugs* that bind to and modulate inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors called GABA\_A receptors. Because several genes that encode these receptors are duplicated in Dup15q syndrome, we think that this EEG signature might be indicative of GABA\_A receptor subunit expression. For this reason, *the EEG signature we've identified might be useful for guiding clinical trials that target these neurotransmitter receptors*.

My colleagues and I will be answering your questions at **1pm EST** (10am PST). We're looking forward to discussing our work with these awesome kids. Ask Us Anything!

As for the algorithm, it's built by some MIT researchers, and you can read more about the math behind it in the paper and its associated citations. The concept of "gravity" is certainly a good one, though, as you note, certain sub-centers depend on larger ones for their own pull.

<TEXT> Alasdair: thanks for commenting. Inspirations? Well, we do like data and maps but we start with questions. In this case it was basically 'what does the economic geography of the US look like on the ground?' - i.e. where do you draw the boundaries if you consider commuting. Commute data were available and are a key economic dataset so that is where we began. 
Data: American Community Survey commute data.
Advice: think of interesting questions and useful analysis. You can always learn software and techniques but think very hard before doing any analysis about what it is that matters. That would be my basic advice. Don't worry about making mistakes or breaking things and particularly don't worry about not knowing stuff. The more you know, the more you find out that you're just scratching the surface!
Also, keep up learning ArcGIS but also explore open source tools like QGIS.

<TEXT> Alasdair: this is related to the geographic scale of our analysis where sometimes places quite far apart merge into single megaregions. Sometimes it's because there are a group of long distance commuters (perhaps even commuting on a weekly basis) but other times it may be that they are relatively well connected in the context of the national pattern as a whole. In short, some regions can look odd and this is certainly not a definitive final map, but it does mirror broad underlying commute patterns. Sometimes they surprised us. </TEXT>

Many of the state, city, and town borders we now have made perfect sense for a world of small agricultural towns and horse travel. But they've remained fixed over the course of centuries. Geographic areas need to be stable enough for people to feel like they "belong" to them over time.

<TEXT> Garrett: Here's a quote from Lewis Mumford that I think bears on your question: 

 The more thoroughly one is acquainted with the social and geographic facts in any area, the more keenly one becomes aware that unity and differentiation go hand in hand. When one searches for unity, the human race is obviously one. When one looks for differences one discovers not only national types and regional types, one discovers likewise important differences between a Florentine and a Neapolitan, between a Glasgow man and an Edinburgh man, even differences in language, accent, gesture, feeling between villages that are but a days walk apart. Finally, one reaches the primordial unit of individuality and realizes that no two identical finger prints of different persons have yet been discovered. Unity does not annul difference; and difference does not undermine a dynamic unity. (*The Culture of Cities* (1938), pp. 310311).

As that quote suggests, yes, we can always go smaller, and break a whole region up into smaller sub-regions (and then break those up, and so on). Similarly, we can always go bigger, since pretty much the whole globe is covered in a dense layer of interconnections. The trick is finding some "stable" geographic areas at the in-between of unity and difference! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Garrett: We discuss the problem of isolated areas in the paper, focusing on the area of eastern Kentucky which the algorithm decided deserved to be called its "own" region. These require tricky judgment calls. This area may not have many commuters leaving its fairly self-enclosed territory. But should we call it an "independent" region on par with Greater NYC or Greater LA? That's one of the situations where qualitative analysis has to be brought to bear on the computational results.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Garrett: I was also surprised at the line that almost perfectly traces the WI-IL border, especially given that these two states have a tax reciprocity agreement. It just goes to show how old boundaries have the ability to reproduce themselves. Folks from Janesville might think of people from Wausau as being more their "neighbors" compared to those from Rockfordeven though from a purely "natural" geography that makes no sense. How we imagine ourselves in places has huge effects on where we choose to live, travel, and who we interact with! </TEXT>

It's important to note that the borders we've drawn don't represent solid lines across which no commutes occur. And we're also not saying that everyone within these areas is commuting to one central location. Instead, we're looking for *relatively well-integrated sets of points*. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alasdair: you're right in relation to the question of long commutes. However, you would be very surprised by some of the extreme commutes, which you can see on p.8-10 of this if you're really keen: http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/89361/7/WRRO_89361.pdf The point is that the 'megaregions' are a kind of geographic container for smaller sub-regions and your FL example is a good one. But, within these wider areas there are some very long 'mega-commutes', for sure. On b), the final map involved a bit of human interpretation as well. It's the only one where we tried to combine our decision making with that of the algorithm. Think of it as a map for discussion and debate rather than a final product!

<TEXT> Garrett: What's important to note about the size of the regions is that they *don't* mean that everybody is commuting to a single place. In fact, more people commute long distances to get to NYC than they do to New Orleans, but New Orleans is set inside a much larger region than NYC is in this research.

The reason is that we're trying to find *collections of relatively interdependent nodes.* For instance, if point A is strongly connected to B, and B strongly to C, and C to D, then those four points seem to make up a whole region even if very few people are commuting from A to D. 

Meanwhile, you can *always* drill down smaller, detecting sub-communities within sub-communities even down to the neighborhood level. So the problem is to figure out where there are meaningful breaks in the pattern. 

In reply to your follow-up: the data makes no distinction about mode of transport. All we know is how many people leave one census tract (as their home, or origin tract) and arrive at another census tract (as their work, or destination tract).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Garrett: Definitely. As we note in the paper, commutes are just one proxy for the kinds of economic and social relationships we're interested in. But of course, goods circulate as well as people! And there are other important flows, too. William Cronon, in his book *Nature's Metropolis*, uses bankruptcy records to show how capital flows connected Chicago to vast swathes of the Midwest in the nineteenth century. You can pick many different variables like these and use them to argue for different kinds of "whole" geographies. </TEXT>

But those old borders, of course, still have power: they control where we vote, where we pay taxes, where laws are enforced, and so on. Our hope is that by offering an evidence-based analysis of how people move around, we can push both administrators (like transport planners) as well as ordinary citizens rethink what geographic categories are most relevant today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Garrett: I'll add to this that creating "fair" electoral districts is definitely one place where we hope this research informs policy. However, there is a big catch: the requirement that electoral districts have roughly equal populations. That *wasn't* a requirement for our regionalization; we're concerned only with "whole" sets of commuter relationships, regardless of the population involved.

While electoral districts certainly can be more or less fair, there is really *no* way to create a perfect algorithm that would take border-drawing entirely outside of human subjectivity. The heterogeneity of geographic patterns simply leads to too many potentially "correct" solutions.

With that said, I'm currently working on a districting algorithm that uses density-based core areas to agglomerate equal-population districts. Keep an eye out for more! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Garrett: This is a very important question which, to be answered properly, requires invoking political theory, sociology, and the philosophy of organismic complexity! I can't do all of those topics justice here, but both the Haldane and Alexander pieces you quote above are good examples of the theory that there is some "natural" size of human community, above which size organized social functions tends toward chaos. This is a very old idea: Aristotle, for instance, also argued that there was a correct size for the ideal community, summed up by the rather tricky concept of "self-sufficiency."

In our case, we artificially limited the community-detection software to produce 50 communities, a number based on the current count of US states (the final map, as noted, includes some subjective toying with the purely computational boundaries). However, these are *not* limited by equal population. Some regions are an order of magnitude larger than others.

Here again, we face the tricky question of "self-sufficiency." Imagine two small communities that *only* have economic interactions with each other. Then imagine a massive conurbations of cities deeply interlinked. Does the former, isolated region deserve to be "one" place, and the latter, interlinked region also deserve to be just "one" place? Herein lies the paradox at the center of this research!

<TEXT> Garrett: This is a great question, and it points to some issues with how we treat "big data" as a kind of evidence. In the case of our study, the commuter counts come from the US Census Bureau, and therefore the data set doesn't include international commutes. My hunch is that if such data were available, you'd likely see some international regionsperhaps Seattle-Vancouver, Buffalo-Niagara, or, as CptnStarkos suggests below, San Diego-Tijuana.

Because the available sources for large data sets like these tend to come from national agencies, they have the effect of reproducing the territorial integrity of the nation itself. That's one of the reasons why we should always be careful about claiming that data analysis leads to some perfectly "correct" or "true" solution.

Regarding ethnic groupings: the Cooper Center's [racial dot map of the United States](https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/index.html) is an absolute must-see on this topic. While it doesn't include commutes (just home locations, aggregated by block group), it still makes residential segregation shockingly apparent.

If we could find good data about individuals race/ethnic status as well as their commuter habits, it's possible you'd begin to see overlapping regions, where different kinds of people inhabit very different territories. For instance, it's likely that many of the people commuting into New York City from Westchester County are white, while a self-contained commuting group in Harlem and the Bronx could emerge. Those are just guesses, of course, but they suggest some of the ways in which a totalizing geography has its limitations. </TEXT>

We were interested to see what would happen if we tried to divide the country up based on patterns of commuting, but using a computational approach rather than a cultural or historical one. As you can see, the results do make some sense geographically, but of course we realise they are not perfect! In fact, our work was in part a test to see whether you can use algorithms on their own to do this kind of thing. Our conclusion is that you also need human input. We use commuting because it is a very important part of the economic functioning of the nation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is [Alasdair Rae](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/usp/staff/alasdair_rae) and I am Senior Lectuer in Urban Studies and Planning at the University of Sheffield, in England. My research focuses on geographic analysis, and particularly on how places connect, or not. One of the main things I'm interested in is the difference between political boundaries, such as counties and states, and how this compares with patterns of human connection on the ground, such as commuting and migration.

And I'm [Garrett Dash Nelson](http://people.matinic.us/garrett); I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the Society of Fellows and the Department of Geography at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. I work on the history of geographic problems in planning, and I'm interested in how the human landscape and social action structure one another.

Last month, we published a paper titled ["An Economic Geography of the United States: From Commutes to Megaregions"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166083) in the journal [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/) . We were curious what would happen if we tried to divide the geography of the United States up by using data about millions of Americans' commuting habits, instead of relying on old borders like state and city lines. We tried two ways of interpreting the data. First, we made "flow maps," which allowed us to visually interpret where clusters of commuters are congregating. Second, we used an algorithm to do what's called "community detection"finding groups of closely related points within a network of complex interrelations. We ended up with a new map of the United States that offers a new way of thinking about what kind of areas match the geographic patterns of our real lives.

We'll be answering your questions at 1pm ET -- Ask Us Anything!

<TEXT> In terms of the data we have, physical age is easily measurable in years, but the concept of mental age is harder to quantify. We saw changes in dynamics that can be related to physical age, but are unable to obtain a variable as concrete as mental age from these results. However, there is a range of hypergraph cardinality for any given age, which could indicate that some older individuals are able to effectively use a typically younger hypergraph structure to achieve roughly the same performance as others in their age group.

In the broader field, there is a lot of recent interest in trying to predict various aspects of individuals on the basis of properties about their brain (for example, see this months special issue of NeuroImage, which is devoted to individual subject prediction: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10538119/145/part/PB). In this vein, hypergraph cardinality may in fact be one component of an individuals mental age. </TEXT>

As we noted in other replies, its unclear whether the properties of brain organization that we focused on can be changed; its also unclear what specific role these properties play in cognitive performance, if any. Generally speaking, current research favors tried-and-true methods for maintaining cognitive functioneating and sleeping well, exercising, and staying cognitively activeover less proven approaches like brain training or neurostimulation (the latter of which can actually be dangerous). </TEXT>

<TEXT> These are some great examples of different cognitive demands that can be placed on us throughout our lifespans. A main takeaway message from our paper is that older adults appear to have developed different methods for performing our memory tasks than the younger cohort uses on average. We actually do not see significant differences in performance between these two groups - potentially indicating that the adaptations are effective! In this study, we controlled for alcohol, caffeine, exercise, and cigarette use in the past 24 hours, but the data on other drug use was limited to one out of the two data sets we used. Although there are complications in doing studies that involve the use of controlled substances in humans (in the US), it is certainly possible that future research will apply our techniques to examine the impact of the use of various substances (including, for example, tobacco, alcohol, pharmaceuticals, or cannabis). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Excellent question! This is indeed an exciting time for the field of fMRI. For the most part, our method wont change as the technology improves, because those improvements most involve increases in spatial and temporal resolution (and our method, roughly speaking, works at an effective resolution well below the current state-of-the-art, because it considers brain regions hundreds of cubic millimeters in size on a timescale of roughly a minute). However, some advances, such as multi-echo imaging (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3350785/), may improve our method if they help us do a better job removing unwanted sources of noise (such as head motion or physiological noise) from the signal of interest (that is, blood oxygen level dependent signal). </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the most interesting seeming paradox in our study: we are looking at organization in a memory task, yet despite these changes in brain organization, we dont see any behavioral changes across age groups. As we hinted at in other replies, one intriguing possibility (given that we intentionally studied only participants who were unimpaired on the memory task) is that the changes we see in hypergraph structure actually reflect adaptive changes that protect these individuals from age-related memory decline. Another possibility is simply that the hypergraph properties we are focusing on, which reflect very high-level, whole-brain properties of brain organization, simply arent specified on a level where the differences we can measure would have any reliable impact on memory. Either way, it is certainly a question we hope to see answered soon!

<TEXT> We had data on hundreds of individual differences such as gender, years of education, personality, and preferred cognitive strategy (as measured by well known tests). Unfortunately, we did not record whether the subjects were monolingual. Despite all of the data we had access to, the only significant correspondence with the hypergraph cardinality trait was age. However, hypergraph cardinality is only one way to simplify the hypergraph. There could be other features that we did not investigate that may exhibit differences between subgroups. There is an interesting literature suggesting that multilingualism may confer various cognitive benefits, and may be associated with changes in brain function or organization.

<TEXT> Thats an excellent point. Indeed, its entirely possible that changes in society (for instance, food production, the chemical composition of daily products, and technology have all changed radically in the past several decades) are responsible for the differences in hypergraph structure we observed, rather than age per se. Unfortunately, fMRI has existed for under three decades, and there are (to our knowledge) no longitudinal studies that cover even a majority of this span. Nonetheless, we certainly hope that going forward, this technique will be applied to other datasets. In the last five years or so, there have been more concerted efforts to collect longitudinal fMRI data (particularly so-called resting state data), so it may soon be possible to more directly address the question of what exact role age plays. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In this study, we used fMRI to measure brain activity while participants performed the memory task. We then applied a mathematical technique (described more thoroughly in some of the other answers) to quantify how cohesive the brain activity in different brain areas was. Our results showed that the functional organization of connectivity between brain areas is less cohesive in older adults, and although there are some gaps in our age scale, this change seems to be fairly continuous and gradual with age, rather than being discrete or sudden.

In our sample, there was no significant age-related cognitive decline, which was at least partially due to our intentionally selecting older adults who were able to perform the task. However, other work on cognition and aging suggests that, absent any sudden change like illness or injury, cognitive performance also tends to change gradually with age, although it does tend to be nonlinear, such that the changes accelerate with increased age. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The good news is that we found no significant differences in cognitive function or brain dynamical structure between the 18 year old subjects and the group in their mid 20s! You can see this nicely in Figure 11 of our paper. There are, however, major developmental changes in brain structure and function throughout childhood and teenage years - Dani Bassett at the University of Pennsylvania and her colleagues have some particularly interesting results using network methods. So its not surprising if you feel that your cognitive function and learning ability is different from when you were younger, but it is not necessarily worse!

There is research suggesting that early childhood is associated with a sort of special capacity for learning, especially in domains like language, although there is some debate in the field on this so-called critical period theory. If such a critical period exists, it is unlikely that there is anything one can do later in life to recapture this critical periodnor is it clear that it would be a good thing if one could. Regarding the goal of increasing cognitive function, this is a topic of a considerable amount of active debate. We will note only that the evidence for the effectiveness of, for example, cognitive training regimens is mixed at best. Existing research suggests that simple practices like getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, eating healthily, and engaging in cognitively demanding practices like learning a foreign language are probably the best place to start in the quest to stay mentally fit! </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are truly sorry to hear about your mother. A major goal of work in related fields is to understand how healthy aging progresses. There were no significant differences in memory performances between the age groups in our study, so the differences in hyperedge structure could be related to cognitive mechanisms developed by older adults to compensate for memory changes related to age. We hope future work can clarify how structural hypergraph changes are related to age, which may give insight into strategies for maintaining memory.

Note also that, because we were primarily interested in studying memory-related processes, we specifically selected older adults who didnt exhibit memory impairments. Given the large differences in hypergraph structure between age groups, but the lack of any behavioral differences, one of the most interesting future extensions of our work will be to apply the same methodology in populations exhibiting cognitive decline, or in patients with a genetic predisposition toward early-onset dementia (for instance, see this recent NPR article: http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/12/27/506720771/early-alzheimer-s-gene-spells-tragedy-for-patients-opportunity-for-science). It is also unclear from our work whether changes in hypergraph structure with age are inevitable, or if there are measures individuals can take (for example, exercise, diet, or so on) that might affect hypergraph structure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really interesting question. In this case, we included dozens of variables as covariates, including some that tend to correlate with socioeconomic status (SES) like education level, although we did not include any questions about SES explicitly. However, our participants were sampled from the Santa Barbara community, so it is possible that there are systematic differences in SES or other factors relative to the US or global population, so it is an open question to what degree our results generalize to the wider population. In particular, SES has been shown to have profound effects on brain development and function (for instance, see http://www.pnas.org/content/112/51/15530.full.pdf or http://www.attn.com/stories/2442/effects-poverty-brain-mental-health) so we certainly might expect SES to impact hypergraphs.

<TEXT> Great question! The finding that hypergraph cardinality doesnt vary much across tasks for an individual but varies enormously across individuals is one of the most exciting findings from our paper. This trait-like quality was what motivated us to look for possible relationships with the data on individual differences between subjects. We investigated a diverse set of possible factors (including scores from personality tests such as the Big 5) and found that age was the only significantly related measure. It would be very interesting to investigate this further and determine whether the differences in hypergraph structure arise as a result of age, or whether they are indicative of a mechanism that works to mitigate age-related changes in memory function (there were no significant differences in memory performance between the age groups). Applications of this type of research are varied, but one of the most critical is an understanding of how healthy aging takes place!

<TEXT> In our work, we use hypergraphs to represent changes in brain networks over short time intervals. Traditional brain network analyses use the strength of correlations in activity between each pair of brain regions as edges. Hypergraphs extend this to another dimension by using the strength of correlations in activity between each pair of edges as hyperedges. In short, hypergraphs represent how regions are linked in a way that factors not only the correlations in activity, but how these correlations change over time. In the future, more complex analyses of brain dynamics could be done using this framework - for example, community detection and other graph theoretic measures could be applied to the hypergraph.

To give an analogy, imagine that you have the GPS coordinates for a set of people. Whenever two (or more) people are moving together, we'll say they're "connected". In traditional approaches to functional brain connectivity, the connectedness of each person to each other person would be determined over the course of an entire measurement (say, a single day, in our analogy). However, the hypergraph approach extends this in two ways. First, it determines connectedness dynamically (for instance, hourly). Then, for each pair of people, you compare the timecourses of their connectedness, and group together pairs where those timecourses are similar.

To make the analogy more concrete, imagine a set of four people: a parent and their child, and another parent with their child. Each parent separately takes their child to different schools at 9am and picks their child up from those schools at 3pm. Each parent's location tracks closely with their child's when the child is not at school, and is unrelated while the child is at school. The traditional approach would conclude that each child/parent pair is weakly connected, and that the two pairs have no relationship. However, the hypergraph method would observe the pattern that each pair is "connected" before 9am and after 3pm, and "unconnected" between 9am and 3pm. (Like the traditional approach, it would also note that the two children and the two parents aren't connected at all.) Because that pattern of connectedness over the course of the day is similar for both pairs, they would be grouped together into a hypergraph!

In our analogy, people are brain areas and GPS coordinates are brain activity, but otherwise everything is the same. </TEXT>

Im Liz Davison, a graduate student at Princeton University in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department. My research centers on development and application of analytical and computational methods from network science and engineering to study complex dynamical systems, including the human brain.

And Im Ben Turner, and Im a postdoctoral researcher in cognitive neuroscience at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses on using functional magnetic resonance imaging to better understand human memory.

We recently published a paper titled [Individual Differences in Dynamic Functional Brain Connectivity Structure Across the Lifespan](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005178) in PLOS Computational Biology. This paper applied a method for characterizing how connections between brain regions change together over time (see our earlier article published in [PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004029) to a group of people including young and older adults. Using different methods, other researchers have shown that the neural activity in parts of the brain that belong to the same network in young adults tends to become less similar by older adulthood. Our results extend this previous result by showing that when brain regions are put in groups based on how their connections change together over time, older adults have a larger number of groups relative to young adults, indicating less-cohesive changes in connectivity.

While antibiotic resistance is not currently a problem with Chlamydia, there are major changes in the microbiome of the female genital tract when broad spectrum antibiotics are used to treat chlamydial genital tract infections.

Yes we have now observed this polarized mode of division in Chlamydia trachomatis serovar B and Chlamydia muridarum.  Although the changes in morphology during the division process are very similar during cell division in these organisms, the localization of the markers (MOMP and LPS) we have used to visualize the division process vary substantially.  We hope that the differences observed among the different Chlamydia will aid us in identifying factors responsible for establishing and maintaining polarity in these cells.

Yes an advantage of developing specific therapies is the prevention of resistance in non-target bacteria, such as Gonorrhea.

We tried several inhibitors in the paper, and every inhibitor appears to have a slightly different effect. Chlamydia is known to lack ftsZ gene, in fact Chlamydia is one of very few bacteria that lacks ftsZ. if you scan the literature you will find several budding bacteria, but looking at the pictures and comparing them to budding yeast or to our pictures it becomes hard morphologically to group budding bacteria in a single group. </TEXT>

How these processes are regulated in Chlamydia is not known at this time.  Our studies suggest lipid asymmetry is associated with the cell division process.  I am hopeful that our inhibitor screens will identify factors necessary for establishing and maintaining these specialized membrane domains, which are likely necessary for the polarized division process. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are correct that Chlamydia, which lacks FtsZ, is dependent upon MreB for assembling peptidoglycan at the septal plane.  This was elegantly shown recently by Liechti and his colleagues.  We also know from our work that FtsQ accumulates in the septum between dividing cells.  Whether FtsQ localization is dependent upon MreB is not clear at this time.
We have not yet identified any new components necessary for this polarized division process.  This is the goal of our current studies.  MOMP localization serves as a marker for the division process but it does not direct asymmetric membrane expansion.  Our recent studies have shown that Chlamydia trachomatis serovar B (a trachoma causing serovar) divides by the same polarized division process but MOMP accumulates in the septum not in the expanding membrane of the daughter cell. So MOMP isnt driving the process.  Our goal is to identify what is driving the process.  The fact that division septum is localized to the base of the bud suggests that there is a specific mechanism involved.
This mode of cell division seems to have evolved in free-living bacteria (Planctomycetes) and obligate intracellular bacteria (Chlamydia).  As you point out both organisms lack FtsZ.  Whether it is the absence of FtsZ that accounts the multi-budding phenotype we observe in Chlamydia remains to be established.

However, recent advances in chlamydial genetics make our goal of identifying potentially novel machinery that is necessary for chlamydial cell division feasible.  From our work and the work of others, we are developing some understanding of how Chlamydia develops polarity and forms a septum between dividing cells, but we have yet to identify a unique target that is necessary chlamydial cell division.  It is our hope that coupling a genetic approach with inhibitor studies will lead to the identification of one or more of these key components in this unique polarized cell division process.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Hey guys, great work, and congrats on the PLOS Pathogens paper! I gave it a quick read-through, and I have a few questions.
 
 
 
 My understanding is that recent work (from Liechti and others) suggests a model where Chlamydia still needs (and has) enough peptidoglycan (PG) to form a septum. The PBP enzymes that insert/act on this PG ring are coordinated by "bacterial actin" MreB (which normally organizes elongation, not division) rather than "bacterial tubulin" FtsZ. However, FtsQ (normally part of the FtsZ-coordinated division machinery) still localizes to the septum. This suggests a hybrid model of division, where components of different growth/division machinery work together in an unusual fashion (for example, MreB and FtsQ). Please correct me if I am wrong.
 
 
 
 My questions are:
 
 
 
     Do your results have any impact on this model, to either support or update it?
 
 
 
     Your results seem to confirm that the major determinants of division in Chlamydia are mostly involved in necessary functions in other bacteria (e.g., MreB, FtsQ, etc.). Why, then, do you think that this asymmetric division suggests new drug targets or treatment paradigms? Have you discovered any new components necessary for division in Chlamydia? How significant is it that the MOMPs localize asymmetrically? Does this suggest they are involved in division/asymmetry generation?
 
 
 
     Do you think that Chlamydia's asymmetric division is adaptive, or do you think it's a byproduct of a bug that lives in a fairly unique environment (intracellular) that has a stripped down "minimal machinery" for division, and that this set of minimal machinery happens to be disregulated enough that it now doesn't have much control over septum placement?
 
 
 
 Thanks!

We have just started high-throughput screens to identify drugs that may be used to specifically prevent the chlamydial cell division process.  The only other organisms that we are aware of that utilize a similar mechanism of cell division are members of the Planctomycetes, which are not human pathogens.  While antibiotic resistance is not currently a problem with Chlamydia, there are major changes in the microbiome of the female genital tract when broad spectrum antibiotics are used to treat chlamydial genital tract infections.  This change in the microbiome can lead to outgrowths of Candida (yeast infections) and bacterial vaginosis, both of which negatively impact the quality of life for women.  It is our hope that the development of specific inhibitors will prevent these unwanted outcomes of broad spectrum antibiotic therapies for treating Chlamydia genital tract infections. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

Im John Cox, a faculty member in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Biochemistry at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. And I am Yasser Abdelrahman a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Restorative Dentistry at Oregon Health and Sciences University.

We have been interested in the molecular mechanisms that regulate the growth of Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular pathogen that is the leading bacterial cause of sexually transmitted infections. The ultimate goal of these studies is to develop therapies to specifically prevent chlamydial growth.  We recently published a manuscript, [Polarized Cell Division of Chlamydia trachomatis](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005822) in PLOS Pathogens. Although it was assumed that this organism divides by binary fission, we showed in this manuscript that Chlamydia trachomatis divides by a polarized cell division process that is similar to the budding process of a subset of the Planctomycetes. This mechanism of cell division has not been documented in other human bacterial pathogens suggesting the potential for developing Chlamydia-specific therapeutic treatments.

<TEXT> TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in all of cancer, and especially in breast cancer. TP53 is more commonly mutated in the more aggressive breast cancers. Many researchers have worked tirelessly to try and identify therapeutic interventions to target TP53; however, this protein is incredibly complex with diverse functions across the cell. TP53 function can be completely disrupted in some cancers (as in classic tumor suppressor) but also can acquire missense mutations and thus gain new functions (similar to an oncogene). It is involved in both cell death and cell growth. This all complicates research in identifying both the role of TP53 in breast cancer metastasis as well as successful therapeutic interventions.


As for saving tissues from tumors for future therapy: we as researchers have seen the power of new technologies over the last decade, allowing DNA and RNA sequencing from tissues that was not possible before. We urge the proper collection and storage of tissue, as it is impossible to predict how this tissue could be used in future studies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is our speculation. In order for a breast cancer to break off, survive through circulation, successfully land in a distant organ, and survive all while escaping immune surveillance, some level of genetic diversity and adaptation is needed. Others have observed clumps of circulating tumor cells in cancer patients, further suggesting that multiple cells are needed in order for metastasis to be successful. Potentially, this genetic diversity would be better shared across multiple tumor cells rather than the entire genetic burden existing in one cell. Furthermore, cross-talk between multiple types of cells could be beneficial: studies in our lab have demonstrated that in a mixed population of cells containing both claudin-low (stem-cell like population) and basal-like cells, when we isolate only 1 population of cells, the cells can repopulate both populations such that both populations are in the final culture. This suggests both tumor cell plasticity as well as a need for both populations to exist for the cancer cells to continue to grow. Both data from our studies and many others continue to support the need for multiple targeted therapies delivered together.

<TEXT> Correct. Because these basal-like cancers were very aggressive and only chemotherapy treated (A1 only 1 round of chemo), the metastatic process of these tumors might be different compared to other breast cancers or other cancer types.  We have previously identified data that suggests basal-like breast cancer develops from a different cell of origin than luminal breast cancer. This very likely extends to mechanisms of metastasis as well. Further research in basal-like breast cancer, luminal breast cancer, and Her2-driven breast cancer are needed to truly understand the differences and similarities of mechanisms of metastasis in breast cancer.

<TEXT> There is not much consensus in the field of understanding about metastasis. The seminal paper first describing DNA sequencing of a matched tumor and metastasis was in renal cell carcinoma, demonstrating branched evolution with a single cell of origin seeding distant metastasis. A study of basal-like breast cancer, the matched metastasis, and a xenograft show high percentage of shared genetics across all 3 tumors. Single cell sequencing of one breast cancer with one matched liver metastasis suggest a single cell seeded the distant site. This is corroborated by a large panel of matched primary and brain metastases sequenced, showing continued evolution and acquisition of resistance mechanisms in the brain metastasis specifically. A larger study in prostate cancer suggests metastasis can seed other metastases. Other studies in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and ovarian cancer all shed light on the cancer evolution through metastasis. Few studies, however, have more than 1-3 matched metastases with the original tumors. Furthermore, advances in DNA and RNA sequencing provide even greater depth of coverage and only further illuminate the genetic complexity of cancer. Further research with 3 matched metastases and primaries across multiple subtypes of breast cancer is needed. Parallel studies in immunocompetent in vivo models are needed to better understand mechanisms of metastasis. There is no consensus, but there might not be a consensus, as there are likely diverse mechanisms of metastasis and therapeutic resistance across different types of cancer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our current dataset is limited by only having two patients with shared sites including the lung and liver metastases. On-going work in both the United States and Europe looking at 200 women with matched primary and distant metastatic sites will hopefully address your question. A much larger cohort is needed to statistically determine why specific subtypes of breast cancer tend to metastasize to different organs (i.e. ER+, luminal tumors are more likely to first relapse in the bone while HER2-enriched tumors are more likely to relapse in the liver, and basal-like tumors are more likely to relapse in the lung and brain).

<TEXT> False negatives are extremely difficult to address; however, we did reinterrogate all mutations from the metastases in the primary tumors. We had bioinformaticians who visually inspected the alignment of reads to address this concern. Upon review, we identified low percentage clones in the primary that would typically be filtered when using a VAF cutoff of 5% or greater. Another method that we researched was compiling all alignments from one person (i.e. all 6 tumors sequenced) to achieve 400X coverage at positions and subsequently call mutations. Others have published on similar methods and demonstrate the power of using sequencing from related tumors to lower the false negative rate.

<TEXT> From the manuscript that you have linked I think you might be looking at non-synonymous, significantly mutated gene figure (Fig3).  These are genes that are recurrently mutated in the larger cohort. This also looked at breast cancer as a whole.  We have previously shown that the mutation rate varies by molecular subtype (doi:  10.1038/nature11412), with Luminal A tumors having lower mutation rates than the more aggressive tumors types like Basal-like and HER2-enriched. The range in mutations per sample is quite varied in breast cancer.  From TCGA we found a range of 1-6,000 mutations per sample in breast cancer.  We used both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations for our clonality analyses. But as you mention, more aggressive subtypes of breast cancer have larger mutational burdens.  Researchers are expanding their analyses to look at CTCs. However, for these two patients, we did not have blood to look at CTCs.

<TEXT> Our study is limited in that we have only looked at two patients so far, but is intriguing to find that most of the mutations observed in the metastases of these triple negative breast cancers were also in the primary.  These tumors were highly aggressive and are not representative of all of breast cancer: Patient A1 was diagnosed with metastatic disease. We think that it suggests that better targeting of the heterogeneous primary tumor might help reduce metastatic disease. Our finding of multiple clones in the primary also beg for development of new targeted approaches to wipe out the potentially metastatic clones. At this point we cannot conclude if this mechanism is similar in less aggressive breast cancers or other tumor types.  Indeed in other tumors like renal cancer, they show that the acquisition of mutations are required for metastasis to occur. Future research in larger cohorts of metastatic breast cancer patients are needed to identify therapeutic targets to block this process.

As many of us, I was personally affected by a close family member with cancer and wanted to know why - why did some cells go awry in my family member? Why was she so sick? And if we knew the underlying cause, why couldnt we cure it like a simple strep throat? This led to a passion of mine for both medical care and research. Through research, we can directly discover something that may help push the needle just a little bit towards cure. I would encourage any and all women with a passion for science and the curiosity and drive to pursue a career in STEM fields. My advice for women (and men as well!) would be to involve yourself in opportunities that excite you. Identifying a mentor in your field who is truly invested in your success will allow for career guidance at critical steps: applying to graduate school, identifying the right project, and successfully applying for funding.


Katherine: I was born when my dad was in graduate school getting his PhD and was often around the lab.  Science was something I was always interested in and I enjoyed working with my dad on science fair projects as a kid.  When I was in high school, I got a job at a research facility near my house to get hands on experience doing research - both lab and field work.  I found as many ways as possible to get involved in school or outside of school in science activities. I had a strong interest in genetics and that was my motivating interest in applying for graduate school.  My background was mostly plant research, but once in grad school, I found an advisor and lab I really liked that studied breast cancer and it stuck. My advice is to seek out opportunities and become involved.  Similar to what Marni said, finding a mentor to help and support you is a great as well and can help you figure out opportunities.

<TEXT> Thanks for your questions. 
We found sets of mutations, or clones, within different percentage of cells in the primary (as measured by the variant allele frequency) that were also observed in the metastatic tumors. Many of these clones were shared with some but not all of the metastases, indicating distinct populations of cells. All tumors, including the primary and metastases had evidence of multiple clones, with many of the metastatic clones derived from multiple clones within the primary which had then moved/metastasized to other sites of the body. The genome coverage was between 29X to 72X for the samples sequenced. Bulk tumor RNA/DNA sequencing is always limited by sampling error (i.e. sequencing only a small biopsy or only one section of the tumor). Previous work by others have compared multiregional sequencing in primary breast cancer which demonstrate the vast heterogeneity within each primary. Despite this limitation, our analysis still demonstrates multiple clones (genetic heterogeneity) in the primary which is reflected in the metastases.


Our group has not been investigating the mechanism of how multiple cells may be metastasizing but we would refer you to two excellent, recent publications in PNAS where the authors Au et al (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1524448113) and Cheung et al (10.1073/pnas.1508541113) experimentally assess mechanisms of polyclonal seeding.


Your third bullet raises a very interesting question which we have also discussed; however, this is out of the scope of our current study. We would refer you to the Cheung et al. (10.1073/pnas.1508541113) study which investigated this interdependence further. 




 When we looked at the RNA expression profiles of our tumors compared to over 1000 breast cancers from TCGA, we found the metastases were more like their primary tumor than they were to other breast cancers - primary or metastasis.  When we collected the metastases, we also collected normal tissue when we could and performed RNA sequencing on those as well.  We found that the metastases looked much more like the primary breast cancer than to normal tissue from the site where the metastasis occurred.  The dominant expression profiles were similar. However, this does not suggest that the microenvironment isnt playing a role, and we definitely agree both the stroma and the immune component are very important.  We havent specifically looked at the microenvironment role in these samples yet.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


We are Katherine Hoadley and Marni Siegel, researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's [Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://unclineberger.org/). Our research focuses on understanding why some breast cancers spread throughout the body, a process known as metastasis.


We recently published a paper titled ["Tumor Evolution in Two Patients with Basal-like Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Genomics Study of Multiple Metastases"](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1002174) in [PLOS Medicine](http://www.plosmedicine.org/).


We wanted to understand how hormone negative tumors in the breast travelled to distant sites, a process known as metastases. By comparing the original breast cancer to distant tumors, we looked for DNA changes that were both shared and unique at these different sites. We found that, in two patients, the majority of disease-causing DNA changes in the metastases are established in the original tumor, and that these metastatic tumors are made up of multiple distinct populations of cells, or clones, from the original tumor.

<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: Protein aggregation has been linked to many neurodegenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (plaques and tangles), Parkinson's Disease (alpha synuclein aggregation), Huntington's Disease (huntingtin protein aggregation). These aggregates serve as pathological hallmarks of each of these diseases. Our work shows that NMNAT2 can function as a protective protein, called a chaperone, which can bind to such aggregated toxic proteins and allow them to be refolded. At the same time, NMNAT2 can also bind to such proteins that are prone to aggregate and prevent this aggregation process. Hence, as a chaperone, NMNAT2 can reduce protein aggregation burden and protect neurons from dying from such proteotoxicity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: Part of a previous answer might address your question.

There is strong evidence suggesting that caffeine intake via 2-3 cups coffee containing 95200 mg caffeine or several cups of tea per day reduce the risk of dementia. Our preliminary and unpublished studies find that treating adult mice with caffeine (equivalent to about 3 cups of coffee for a human) can increase NMNAT2 protein levels in the brain. Together, these results suggest that caffeines beneficial affects on dementia may be by increasing NMNAT2 levels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter:

* 1) NMNATs have been shown to be neuroprotective by many different groups in different model systems, ranging from Drosophila to mouse models of neurological disorders. A wide range of published work has already established NMNAT2 as an important neuronal protein. Our earlier work has shown that NMNAT2 levels decline quite early in a mouse model of tauopathy, prior to the onset of any behavioral deficits and brain degeneration. Also, we were amazed to observe an improvement in brain degeneration in these mice, when we genetically increased the levels of this protein in diseased neurons. In our recent work, we wanted to understand the mechanisms by which this protective protein was offering such robust improvements.

* 2) In this paper, we discovered a novel chaperone function of NMNAT2 that allows it to reduce aggregated proteins that are likely causes to neuronal death and dysfunction in many of these brain diseases. To function as a chaperone that can refold these proteins, NMNAT2 needs to interact with HSP90. Without this interaction it cannot act to refold these toxic proteins. We are certain that NMNAT2 is present in both glutamatergic neurons and gabaergic neurons based on our unpublished data, whereby loss of this protein can affect both these types of neurons. We also know that NMNAT2 functions in an activity-dependent manner, where its levels can increase when we treat neurons with forskolin that increases cAMP. At the same time, increasing activity in neurons that lack NMNAT2 promotes cell death, showing a requirement of this protein to buffer excitotoxicity in neurons.

* 3) NMNAT2 is a difficult protein to purify from bacteria. Despite its small size, the stability of the protein is very weak and it easily precipitates during the purification process. Currently, we are exploring alternative ways to purify this protein.

* 4) NMNAT2 appears to be present in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons from an early developmental stage in the mouse brain (unpublished data). From preliminary observations, we do not detect any NMNAT2 in neuronal precursors or progenitors but start detecting it in mature neurons, post differentiation. However, others have also shown its levels to increase in neurons as they mature. In the peripheral neurons, NMNAT2 appears to be very important during development and lack of the protein cause neurite outgrowth deficits. NMNAT2 knock out mice die at birth as a result of collapsed diaphragm from denervation.

* 5) We see a strong correlation of NMNAT2 levels with well-characterized presynaptic proteins such as RIM1 alpha and synaptophysin. We are exploring the underlying basis of this correlation.

* 6) Our next big step is understanding how this protein is regulated. We have a manuscript in revision that outlines essential pathways that regulate the abundance of neuronal NMNAT2. We also are studying why this protein is so important for maintaining the integrity of neurons. We are essentially approaching this question through unbiased mass spectrometric approach to identify the protein interactions of NMNAT2. Although increasing NMNAT2 can be therapeutic in proteinopathies such as tauopathies, we have to understand the functions of this protein in neurons especially since it is extremely labile and has a very short half life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: Dr. Sinclairs work on the role of NAD in aging helps us appreciate the importance of NAD in the normal aging process. With respect to NMNAT2, we show that both the enzyme and chaperone function of this protein performs essential neuroprotective functions in a context-dependent manner. For example, the NAD synthesis activity of NMNAT2 is required to reduce excitotoxicity in developing cortical neurons, while its chaperone function is critical to deal with protein stress. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: I appreciate your interest and please help us to identify the modulators. Yes, NMNAT2 has rather short half-life. It would be great to increase its stability and potentially provide more neuroprotection. However, the labile nature of NMNAT2 may be critical for its endogenous function. Thus, this may be more complicated than one would like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: Is it possible to reduce the risk for dementia in later life through preventative measures? is a question we all like to ask. The answers to this question are complex and vary quite a bit depending on ones genetics and living environment. Epidemiological studies incorporating a large number of subjects and following them for many years are necessary to uncover this. What we found regarding NMNAT2 is just a beginning.  This study points to the importance of neuronal maintenance factors.  House-keeping function has not been actively studied despite the fact that majority of neurons in our brains are born before birth and have to stay functional till the end of our life. More efforts on finding out how neurons maintain their health despite all the stresses they are subjected to during aging are needed to find ways to reduce the dementia risk later in life.

There is strong evidence suggesting that caffeine intake via 2-3 cups coffee containing 95200 mg caffeine or several cups of tea per day reduce the risk of dementia. Our preliminary and unpublished studies find that treating adult mice with caffeine (equivalent to about 3 cups of coffee for a human) can increase NMNAT2 protein levels in the brain. Together, these results suggest that caffeines beneficial affects on dementia may be by increasing NMNAT2 levels. 

Despite the potential cognitive benefits, not everyone can take coffee or tea, especially elderly or people with a history of cardiovascular or high blood pressure problems. We are actively searching for small molecules that modulate NMNAT2 levels either upward or down.

<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: Thanks for a great question! In our recent work, we have shown that this protein works in misfolding protein aggregates, which are typical of many neurological disorders such as AD, PD, HD etc. The fact that this protein is already present at high levels in neurons positions it to serve as a first line of defense in these diseases collectively termed proteinopathies. At the same time, we and others have shown an important neuronal maintenance function of NMNAT2 and the two functions of the protein, enzyme and chaperone, are mutually exclusive and are utilized in a context-dependent manner. Hence, increasing the overall abundance of the protein can be therapeutically relevant. In essence, molecules that upregulate the protein can target both the enzyme and the chaperone functions of the protein and can be applicable in a variety of disorders. </TEXT>

What really matters to us is to deliver our scientific discovery to the public and we believe in open access, the spirit of PLoS journals.  One can spend (waste) a lot of time trying to get ones findings into the highest impact factor journals.  Getting published in high impact journals is often a random process, determined by editors chasing the next hot topic, and is not necessarily a judge of the quality, impact, or significance of the work. 
The list of funding is the sum of all authors and thus is pretty extensive. The most expensive studies are the human studies. Very general advice to be successful in obtaining funding is to have a solid hypothesis for important questions, clear feasibility of the project, and a track record for getting tasks done with scientific rigors. </TEXT>

Until recently, house-keeping functions have not been actively studied, despite the fact that the majority of neurons in our brains are born before birth and have to stay functional till the end of our life. More efforts on finding out how neurons maintain their health despite all the stresses they are subjected to during aging are needed to find ways to reduce neurodegeneration and the risk for dementia later in life. Neurons often have very long and thin processes connected to their pre- or post-synaptic partners. Proteins synthesized in the cell body will need to be transmitted far distances, to where synaptic connections are located. Neurotransmitter release, occurring in under a millisecond upon the arrival of an action potential to the terminal involves a massive number of proteins changing their conformations. Keeping right balance in protein homeostasis in various parts of the neuron is a constant challenge. The accumulation of misformed/misfolded proteins during aging will undoubtedly impair neuronal function and may lead to reduced memory retention. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: Thanks for a great question. Googles venture biotech company, Calico, in collaboration with its pharmaceutical partner AbbVie, has acquired the rights to a class of drugs labeled P7C3.  These drugs can increase cellular NAD levels by acting upstream of NMNAT2 (http://sage.buckinstitute.org/breaking-nad/). This drug selectively binds to and activates NAMPT, an enzyme upstream of NMNATs and increases the levels of NMN, which is a substrate for NMNATs, which convert NMN to NAD. However, if NMNAT2 is reduced, increasing NMN by P7C3 may be insufficient to increase NAD in where is needed. 

With respect to NMNAT2, we show that its chaperone function may protect against proteinopathies, such as AD. In this regard, even if P7C3 increases NAD levels, this may not be effective in clearing the aggregated proteins responsible for neuronal stress and ultimate demise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: Two cell-free assays we used to examine HSP90:NMNAT2 interactions employed recombinant proteins and tested the importance of this complex formation. We found that HSP90 is required for NMNAT2s refoldase activity to reduce citrate synthase aggregates. NMNAT2s ATPase activity is only present when HSP90 binds to it. Thus, the interaction between NMNAT2 and HSP90 is specific for these actions. We certainly appreciate the large numbers of HSP90 partners. However, we found that HSP90:NMNAT2 interactions mainly occur when there are protein aggregates. For example, in wildtype brains, immunoprecipitation using HSP90 antibody doesnt pull down much NMNAT2. In contrast, in tauopathy brains, a lot of NMNAT2 was pulled down by HSP90 antibody. These observations led us to hypothesize that HSP90 interacts with different protein partners depending on its task. NMNAT2s recruitment of HSP90 may reduce HSP90s inhibition on HSF transcription or its other actions. </TEXT>

However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other cells may also express NMNAT2. Several possible strategies can be explored to introduce NMNAT2 into a person. For examples, gene therapy viral vector carrying NMNAT2 or small molecules that increase NMNAT2 levels or stability. Of course, this will require rather extensive drug-discovery efforts. 
Using human tissue samples acquired from Oregon Brain Bank, we found that NMNAT2 levels in the NDAN group (control subjects who had no dementia but with plaques and tangles similar to Alzheimers patients) are about 60% of normal levels. In AD groups, the average NMNAT2 level is 30% of control. Based on this finding, we hypothesize that restoring NMNAT2 levels to 60% will be sufficient to protect from dementia.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Hui-Chen Lu and I am a Professor at Indiana University Bloomington. My research focuses on how neural circuits wire up during development and how to keep neurons healthy despite various insults and with aging. The majority of neurons in the brains are born prenatally and have to stay healthy throughout our lifespan.

My name is Yousuf Ali and I am an assistant scientist in Dr. Lus lab. My research focuses on understanding the underlying mechanisms that disrupt cellular homeostasis and serve as a basis of disease in different proteinopathies, specifically Alzheimers disease and tauopathies.

My name is Hunter Allen and I am a research assistant in the lab of Dr. Hui-Chen Lu at Indiana University Bloomington. I currently head-up operation of our multi-photon microscope as well manage lab IT functions and assist with technical and computing activities such as Matlab, Python, and other programming for data analysis.

My name is Hugo Bellen and I am a Professor at Baylor College of Medicine and a HHMI Investigator. Our research interests include neuronal communication/maintenance and development of scientific tools allowing large scale and efficient scientific discoveries.

We recently published a paper titled [NMNAT2: HSP90 Complex Mediates Proteostasis in Proteinopathies](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002472) in [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology). NMNAT2, or nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase 2, is becoming recognized as a key neuronal maintenance factor. By examining NMNAT2 levels in brains donated by more than 500 elderly people whose cognitive function was tested annually before death, we found higher levels of NMNAT2 in people who had greater resistance to cognitive decline. People with lower NMNAT2 were more likely to suffer from dementia, suggesting that the protein helps preserve neurons related to learning and memory. NMNAT2 exerts both an enzyme function to protect neurons from stress caused by over-excitation, and a 'chaperone' function to combat the misfolded proteins produced in the brain during aging. Many neurodegenerative disorders are caused by accumulation of "misfolded" proteins that clump up in the brain in forms often referred to as "plaques," or "tangles." Using mouse and cell culture models, we found that NMNAT2 act as a molecular chaperone and binds to misfolded proteins to prevent or repair the errors that cause these clumps. Interestingly, its enzymatic function is required to defend against excitotoxicity. Our work here suggests that NMNAT2 uses both its chaperone and enzymatic functions to combat different neuronal insults in a context-dependent manner.

<TEXT> One thought was that the microfluidic mazes enable unprecedented precision of the measurements of cell migration, by the range of parameters to be quantified and reduction of noise from stochastic cell behavior.  Thus, the race could serve as a demonstration and capture differences between cells not available through traditional tools.  Another thought was that we do not really know today what molecular circuits are responsible for the speed and accuracy during migration.  We know some of the key molecules, but the complex connections between the more than 100 molecular types are still up for debate.  Together, a large number of modifications of these circuits and a large number of quantitative measurements could help us reverse engineer these circuits.  This remains the goal for the next iterations of the race.  We have run a few races already for other cell types (e.g. cancer cells) and will continue to increase the number of cell types by engaging an increasing number of scientists in these efforts.

<TEXT> We designed the mazes based on the experience we have to assays for neutrophil migration.

We then realized that this would not be challenging enough for the Dicty and neutrophil cells.  We made these mazes more challenging by adding dead end channels and blocking some of the paths, and including some wider spaces where cells have little mechanical guidance.  You could learn more about how neutrophils interact with various channels by watching our movies on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz1E5UB9wbI list=PLaQa1Eq_GBD2EEgzpMQVOK_4uGos14Q2N

Such therapies may not be sufficient by themselves, but in combinations with other interventions may be helpful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Neutrophils have cannabinoid receptors and a small number of studies have reported that neutrophil motility is reduced by the binding of cannabinoids to the CB(1) and CB(2) receptors. Most of the research has been performed in the context of inflammation, to test the potential of cannabinoids as anti-inflammatory compounds.  It remains to be determined the impact of cannabinoids on these and other diseases.  I agree with you that more research is needed in this area.  There are only a few biomedical labs that do this type of research. The requirements for compliance with the strict rules and regulations that govern the use of cannabinoid compounds is an important factor limiting the number of research labs working with cannabinoids.  It is unclear at this time if cannabinoids are the "answer to cancer" or if they have any potential in that direction.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is the "fight" between our white blood cells and microbes, which ultimately keeps our tissue sterile.  Antibiotics act on one side, killing or impairing microbes, and making white blood cell's job easier. There is also the side of white blood cells.  If we could stimulate the white blood cells to be better "microbe killers" that will also have benefits.  Our research has shown that at least in some patients, the white blood cells (in particular the neutrophils) are impaired - they move slower and are less accurate - see: https://figshare.com/articles/_Spontaneous_Neutrophil_Migration_Patterns_during_Sepsis_after_Major_Burns_/1265814
Thus, better medications are possible.  Unfortunately, we do not have these now.  Hopefully, we will have these just in time, when the antibiotic resistance is becomeing a significant problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi MeloYelo, wonderful to hear from people that are dedicated to research in the field of cell migration! 
1) The choice of Dicty and HL60 was mostly based on practical concerns: these two cell types are most common in labs that study cell motility.  We would race any other cell type if we get the request.
We tried lymphocytes - you could read our recent paper and watch some cool movies in the supplemental material - no login required - http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2015/IB/c5ib00146c#!divAbstract.  We also have experience with dendritic cells and monocytes.  We have a lot of experience with cancer cells moving through the mazes. 
2) There was one attempt to manipulate the integrins.  Unfortunately, not enough cells were available at the day of the race.  I hope we will get to test these cells during the next race, when more of the work will happen in the labs that sign up for the race, to minimize the chances for this issue happening again. 
3. The race tests for several migration patterns.  On the particular topic of chemorepulsion, you will find more ideas from our recent paper that deals with neutrophils and lymphocytes moving towards and away from chemokines.  I am more inclined to say that the "attraction" and "repulsion" classifications are a consequence of the limitations of current technologies to probe cell migration and when one employs more sophisticated tools a whole range of possibilities emerges, which challenge the traditional views of what is an attractant or a repellent for cells. http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5787

<TEXT> This is a great question!  For human neutrophils, some substrates, like glycoprotein E-selectin, could help cells move fast because they replicate molecules that cells would encounter on the walls of the blood vessels.  For Dicty, it may not matter. These cells live in soil usually and are rather resilient to the nature of the substrate they are moving on. 

Yes, we have a recent study that looked at the effect of interactions between platelets and neutrophils.  You could read more about this in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology: http://www.jleukbio.org/content/early/2016/09/12/jlb.1TA1115-517RR.abstract </TEXT>

<TEXT> At this time, the discussion about therapies is more at the concept level.  The fundamental idea is that by controlling cell migration we could control inflammation.  This could work because most of the cells participating in inflammation aka white blood cells reside in the blood most of the time, and move into the tissues only when an inflammation trigger is turned on.  Thus, reducing the number of cells, e.g. neutrophils, from entering a tissue could have an impact on inflammation.  The most important thing for this strategy to work in practice is that the control has to be very precise.  Blocking all neutrophils from entering a tissue would leave the door open for microbes to enter/grow into tissues and will lead to significant problems with infections. Thus, tools to allow us to measure the effect of various interventions with high precision are very important towards this goal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are two aspects of this race that are important to emphasize. First, there is the technological advance that enabled this race in the first place.  The measurements we could make today are the most precise among the various assays available. The technology could be applied to medical problems, like the study we are doing right now on the motility of human neutrophils for diagnosing sepsis.  If you are interested, you could read more about this in one other PLOS One paper we have published recently. http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114509.  

Second, there is the impact on biology.  What we learned from this competition teaches us about long-term strategies to control cell migration, which could ultimately have medical applications.  For example, in measuring neutrophils from patients with sepsis, we find that these neutrophils are moving significantly slower and are less accurate at moving towards targets (e.g. microbes).  If we had a way to correct these deficiencies, we could have better medicines for treating patients with sepsis.  Right now there is no medicine of this kind.  Among the reasons for this situation, our insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms of cell migration.  Our work aims at improving that and obviously, this is going to take a longer time before any medical benefit emerges.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi reddit, my name is Daniel Irimia and I am an Associate Professor in the Surgery Department at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and a Senior Investigator at Shriners Burns Hospital in Boston.  My research focuses on designing novel technologies for measuring the activities of white blood cells from patients, towards better ways to predict, diagnose, monitor, and treat inflammation, infections, and sepsis.  In 2016, I received the "Pioneers of Miniaturization" prize from the Chemical and Biological Microsystems Society, for pioneering work on microfluidic technologies for measuring human neutrophil activities and applications to human diseases.

I am the organizer of the recent [Dicty World Race](https://experiment.com/projects/dicty-world-race-finding-the-fastest-and-smartest-dicty-cells), an unorthodox approach aimed at encouraging biologists to employ emerging microfluidic technologies to make high precision measurements of cell migration for biological and medical research applications.  The results and learning from this experiment were recently published as an article titled [A Worldwide Competition to Compare the Speed and Chemotactic Accuracy of Neutrophil-Like Cells](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0154491) in PLOS ONE.  The race enabled a large-scale comparison of motility and chemotaxis in the engineered cell lines, allowing exploration of a diverse set of strategies for enhancing chemotactic performance. We found that there are tradeoffs between cell speed and chemotactic accuracy in maze-like environments and that the winning cells were not the fastest cell type, but excelled in finding the shortest paths through the maze. These findings could eventually help us develop better therapies against infections and chronic inflammation.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Anirban Banerjee and I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Biosciences   Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, INDIA. I am a microbiologist and my research primarily focuses on the identification of various methods adopted by pathogens to breach different barriers in our body, such as the blood-brain barrier or feto-maternal barrier etc. We hope to learn from the smart tactics employed by these tiny creatures and apply them to deliver drugs across these barriers which are hard to penetrate.

We recently published an article titled [Membrane Vesicles of Group B Streptococcus Disrupt Feto-Maternal Barrier Leading to Preterm Birth](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005816) in [PLOS Pathogens](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens).


It is a well established fact that colonization of vagina and cervix of pregnant women with Group B Streptococcus (GBS), an opportunistic pathogen, significantly increases the probability of preterm birth. However, in fairly large number of cases the bacteria has not been detected in the feto-maternal interface and/or amniotic fluid. This led us to wonder how GBS sitting in the vagina can orchestrate events at the feto-maternal barrier. We were of the opinion that since rupture of amniotic membrane which is a prerequisite for preterm birth involves a complex series of events; this can only be augmented by a host of bacterial factors and not just simply one. Our findings suggest GBS produces membrane bound vesicles (MVs) that are loaded with multiple toxic proteins and enzymes of the bacteria. These MVs are capable of traveling up through the reproductive tract and lead to a series of deleterious effects resulting in extensive damage of the feto-maternal barrier (amniotic membrane) and subsequently preterm birth.

This work was primarily done by four doctoral students in my lab (Manalee Surve, Anajali Anil, Kshama Kamath and Smita Bhutda) in collaboration with Dr. Deepak Modi, from [National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH)](http://www.nirrh.res.in/), Mumbai, INDIA.

<TEXT> Elise: I believe one of the key argument you could give to convince your peer to be open is the following: being open or transparent in research is part of the scientific ethic itself. Many research outcomes/ papers at least in social sciences often end up with key policy recommendations impacting the life of millions of people throughout the world. Those policy recommendations stem from a data analysis process using specific statistical techniques. The inability of replicating those research because of a lack of (raw) data sharing from the author could therefore put some doubts on the research outputs which could potentially be flawed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heather here.  Another incentive for young publishers to publish through OA is that Open Access papers reach more people.  This results in more citations (http://sparceurope.org/oaca_table/) and more discussion on social media (altmetrics).

Altmetrics are particularly relevant for young researchers because they accrue more quickly than citations, but are correlated with future citations.  This can help make a case for the impact of a paper you published just a few months earlier -- so often the case when you are finishing up a PhD or postdoc.  </TEXT>

- it has been shown to be growing within a discipline (ie http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018657#s3)
- there are more government mandates for data sharing (ie White House OSTP memo which applies to articles as well as data https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf)
- more journals are requiring data sharing (see JORD project https://jordproject.wordpress.com/reports-and-article/journals-and-their-policies-on-research-data-sharing/ )

I think data sharing should be required by funders and journals.

<TEXT> Heather:  Yes: focus on more appropriate metrics, and encourage your peers and evaluators to also.  

Being published in a prestigious journal means that 1 editor and 3 anonymous reviewers though a paper was good quality and useful.  This is good, but the citation count a paper receives after publication, and the discussion it inspires on social media are much more appropriate.  

Making your peers and evaluators aware of DORA (the San Fransisco Declaration on Research Assessment, http://www.ascb.org/dora/) will help bring this transition about, making it easier for everyone to publish in OA journals.  And sign DORA yourself while you are there!  :)  http://www.ascb.org/sign-the-declaration/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Achintya here. I wish everyone could be like Bjrn Brembs, who [tweeted last year](https://twitter.com/brembs/status/612937415775416320):

 For the record: since I got tenure in 2012, my non-tenured co-authors decide where we submit our manuscripts.

Sadly, many legacy faculty as I've taken to calling them are too entrenched, as you said. One way to slowly advance science without going to jail is to demonstrate the tangible benefits of OA publishing:

- http://sparceurope.org/open-access/benefits-of-open-access/
- http://www.nature.com/openresearch/about-open-access/benefits-for-authors/
- http://openscience.com/benefits-of-open-access-for-authors/
- http://www.righttoresearch.org/learn/whyoa/index.shtml
- http://www2.le.ac.uk/library/for/researchers/publish/benefits

Further to Heathers point about the citation benefit, I want to point out that all particle-physics data from the CMS Collaboration on the CERN Open Data Portal are released to the public domain under the CC0 declaration and each dataset is assigned a DOI to make it a citable object. We need to start rewarding the data generators as much as we reward the data analysts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brewster, Internet Archive, here.   

We hope that people will post their ongoing career porfolios at places like the Internet Archive, but that is a dream (our site is not great at supporting such things).

For getting the past materials, museums are opening up slowly.   https://archive.org/details/metropolitanmuseumofart-gallery is a positive example.   hopefully all catalogs would go up.   

in practice, publishing on the web seems to have fewer hurdles for reuse than commercial publishing.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi!  This is Heather.  Thanks a lot for the question and feedback :)  Our decision to require Twitter for an Impactstory account was data-driven, as we discuss here: http://blog.impactstory.org/nps  

Briefly: people with a Twitter account were much more likely to like and recommend an altmetrics-based tool.  We have limited resources and want maximum culture change, so we are focusing first on those who are predisposed to think this is all a great idea, and then all of us together can help convince everyone else :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brewster Kahle here.  Not quite a direct answer, but we work with hundreds of organizations to get them to offer their stuff up for free.   people cite costs or copyright, but it is usually "ego", in the sense people try to figure out are they "better off or worse off?" for putting there materials up.     

the best path is say "Try something"  "put your foot in the water".  if it does not work out, then pull out.   but it doesn't happen.  they almost always move forward.

See, for example, a selection of funderss OA policies: http://whyopenresearch.org/funding For a more comprehensive look at *your* funders OA requirements, check out http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/index.php

As I said elsewhere in this AMA, [Even without retractions, top journals publish the least reliable science](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/). Also, [journals with higher impact factors have higher rates of retractions](http://www.nature.com/news/why-high-profile-journals-have-more-retractions-1.15951).

For Open Data there is much more fear: fear that other researchers will find mistakes, that they will do work you yourself want to do soon, and that you will be overwhelmed with questions.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brewster, head of the Internet Archive, here.   

The Internet Archive (archive.org) is concentrating on the published works of humankind:  books, music, video, tv, webpages, software.   (not exclusively these, but concentrating on it).   

There is plenty of money spent, we just need to spend it better.   Libraries worldwide are 30billion/year.   about 1/4 of that goes to publsihers products.   Lets keep that going, but spend it better.

What libraries do, in general, is buy and lend.   So we think we should continue doing that.   We are doing that with books, for instance, in the https://openlibrary.org site.   (try borrowing a book, it is cool).    We also index and lend US TV News programs (try https://tv.archive.org ). </TEXT>

Brewster here: historically, copyright has largely been for control rather than compensation.      

But libraries have a role and responsibility to provide access to all materials.   We just have to live up to it.   We are doing "digitize-and-lend" at scale for the last 6 years and it is working well.   We are talking with others to expand that approach:   https://archive.org/details/TransformingourLibrariesintoDigitalLibraries102016

<TEXT> Achintya here. This isnt as comprehensive an answer as I would like (it's past 23:00 here and Im recovering from a 16-hour trip from DC to Bombay), but I'd like to give you my perspective.

Alexandra Elbakyan (the creator of sci-hub) is called a hero by no less than [the founder of PLOS itself](https://twitter.com/mbeisen/status/797940470684844032). While I dont disagree, I would prefer that access to knowledge produced by taxpayer-funded research didnt require such actions.

One thing to note is that many publishers allow authors to deposit a version of their paper (not the version formatted for publication) on personal or institutional repositories. I therefore prefer things like the [Open Access Button](https://openaccessbutton.org/) and [oaDOI](https://oadoi.org/) (read more about the latter: http://blog.impactstory.org/introducting-oadoi/) to access otherwise-paywalled content.

 these high prices seem to me like a relic of the past.

Bingo! They bring little value to the process and yet these journals have been making [obscene profits each year](https://svpow.com/2012/01/13/the-obscene-profits-of-commercial-scholarly-publishers/) while hiking subscription costs for libraries worldwide. See more on the matter on Bjrn Brembss blog: http://blogarchive.brembs.net/comment-n820.html

 - do you think patent laws and copyright are essential a mask for censorship?

Copyright is certainly abused extensively to deprive us of access to valuable knowledge, but Im not sure Id equate it with censorship. Sorry I cant give you a more nuanced response!

 - do you think, that there is some information out there, that should not be "open access"? if yes: what kind of information would that be?

I would never make confidential data collected as part of my social-science research entirely public. We have to protect the privacy of those who participate in our research. I will only make anonymised datasets public to ensure that the participants to my project cannot be personally identified, so that the views they express cannot be held against them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Achintya here. Thanks for asking two excellent questions, and I hope I can address them sufficiently.

I will start by taking the easy way out and pointing you to a compelling set of points that support open research: http://whyopenresearch.org/ The website is by the brilliant [Erin McKiernan](https://emckiernan.wordpress.com/home/), who has [pledged to be open in her research](https://emckiernan.wordpress.com/pledge/). It brings up several points regarding the incentive structures. Concerning your other points:

 For instance, a publication in a high impact journal like *Science* will be viewed much more favorably by the panel []

[Bjrn Brembs](https://twitter.com/brembs) (whom you should follow for more insight into the Open movement) covers this on his blog in a post titled [Even without retractions, top journals publish the least reliable science](http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/01/even-without-retractions-top-journals-publish-the-least-reliable-science/). Specifically, he points out the following:

 1. Criteria for evidence-based medicine are no more likely to be met in higher vs. lower ranking journals.
 2. There is no correlation between statistical power and journal rank in neuroscience studies.
 3. Higher ranking journals tend to publish overestimates of true effect sizes from experiments where the sample sizes are too low in gene-association studies.
 4. Three studies analyzing replicability in biomedical research and found it to be extremely low, not even top journals stand out.
 5. Where quality can actually be quantified, such as in computer models of crystallography work, top journals come out significantly worse than other journals.
 6. In vivo animal experimentation studies are less randomized in higher ranking journals and the outcomes are not scored more often in blind in higher-ranking journals either.

 [] how can junior scholars be assured that publishing in this manner will both positively impact their own careers and have their ideas taken seriously by their fields?

Theres no reason to hold on to the notion that publishing in open-access journals results in one not being taken seriously. [PLOS](https://www.plos.org/), for example, publishes research of the highest standard. Regarding positive impact on ones career, besides Erins Why Open Research? website, you should check out [this project](http://www.opencon2016.org/research_evaluation) by Erin and [Juan Pablo Alperin](https://twitter.com/juancommander) that aims to examine how faculty are evaluated in the review, promotion and tenure (RPT) process. (More details: http://publishing.sfu.ca/7297-review-promotion-tenure-project/)

 [] are there ways that OA publishing can incorporate the kind of rigor found in the peer review into the process?

Open access and peer review are not mutually exclusive. :) That said, you might want to take a look proposals for post-publication peer review ([here](http://blog.f1000research.com/2014/07/08/what-is-post-publication-peer-review/) and [here](http://blog.scienceopen.com/2016/02/pre-or-post-publication-peer-review/) for example), which concerns your point about everyone having the ability to publish their ideas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Achintya here. Id be happy to give you my perspective on this. I happen to work on the [CERN Open Data Portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/), which we built to serve open data from the LHC collaborations. We have two tiers of data available: so-called derived datasets that are useful in an educational context (see http://opendata.cern.ch/education) and the primary datasets that are in the same format that is used by experimental high-energy physicists (see http://opendata.cern.ch/research). I work for the CMS Collaboration, so I can only really you give the CMS side of things.

The educational datasets are probably the best place to start. The LHC collaborations have been releasing small subsets for the [Physics Masterclass](http://physicsmasterclasses.org/) activities (see http://opendata.cern.ch/search?p=masterclass). In these Masterclasses, thousands of high-school students around the world perform a measurement using real data from the LHC. By releasing larger open datasets, weve seen teachers begin to incorporate them into their teaching, not only to introduce students to cutting-edge fundamental research but also to programming. [Project CODER](http://coder.oproject.org/tiki-index.php) (this is a temporary URL while they update the main website) is one example. You can see teachers reproduce simple analyses using tools such as [Jupyter notebooks](http://coder.oproject.org/tiki-index.php?page=Jupyter+Gallery) and then take these analyses to their students.

Weve also seen open data used in higher education. So far weve released over 300 TB of data. This is not a data volume that can be downloaded and analysed easily. But with a bit of guidance and access to institutional computing resources, some undergrads in Germany have been able to reproduce plots from highly cited CMS papers. (See my panel talk at OpenCon for more details: https://youtu.be/ooSJUlkmcpE#t=51m20s)

Oh, and the datasets are released to the public domain under CC0 public-domain dedication. We hope that more teachers and students can build upon these datasets and develop open education tools. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


 Were all coming back from [OpenCon](http://www.opencon2016.org/), an annual conference that convenes some of the most innovative ECRs to advocate for greater openness and transparency in research and publishing. Were here today to share some of the keynotes from this years conference and to answer your questions about all things open. Heres a little bit more about us, and our individual projects:

I'm [Achintya Rao](http://www.twitter.com/Raoofphysics), a PhD candidate in [science communications](http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/research/sciencecommunicationunit.aspx) at the University of the West of England. I work at CERN as a science communicator for the CMS Collaboration, and have recently been contributing to the development of the [CERN Open Data Portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/). I also wrote the [PhD Starter Kit](https://raoofphysics.github.io/phd-starter-kit/), a guide for early career researchers on how to use different tools to keep data and research more open.


I'm [Brewster Kahle](http://www.twitter.com/brewster_kahle), the Founder and Digital Librarian of the [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org). The goal is Universal Access to All Knowledge.


I'm [Heather Piwowar](http://www.twitter.com/researchremix) and I am a cofounder of [Impactstory](https://impactstory.org/). A service that makes it easy, fun, and free to learn about the online impact of your research, and making a profile is free.


We are a non-profit founded by the Sloan Foundation and the NSF, and our mission is to motivate researchers to make their work open and accessible.


I'm [Soazic Elise WANG SONNE](http://www.twitter.com/wangsonne) and I am a PhD fellow in economics of innovation and technological change at the [United Nations University in Maastricht](http://www.merit.unu.edu/about-us/). I am also serving as a catalyst for the [Berkeley Initiative on Transparency in Social Sciences (BITSS)](http://www.bitss.org/) of the Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) for UC Berkeley. Part of my job as a catalyst is to foster the adoption of transparency and open access practices in social sciences research through advocacy trainings  and workshops. So far, my regions of focus are Europe (UK) and Sub Saharan Africa (Cameroon and South Africa).


I am currently working on the possibility of implementing a randomized control trial to better understand what works to enhance open research practices in French-speaking Sub Saharan African countries. I am also involved on a project aiming at suggesting and constructing an alternative metric to assess academic publication impact in Francophone Sub Saharan Africa taking stock on the Open Peer Review.

It is correct that males are overrepresented for TBI but the sex differences vary widely across the outcomes (e.g., much higher rates of females receiving disability pension while males are overrepresented in premature mortality). It is possible to use family-based designs, such as sibling-comparisons, to examine the moderating role of sex in these associations. Perhaps using alternative designs (e.g., self-reports) to capture those with seemingly minor injuries who avoid seeking medical treatment. As always, there are other limitations to such approaches worth highlighting (e.g., measurement error in reports/attrition in samples) etc." </TEXT>

Levels of severity are useful as they enable health professionals to communicate, although the term 'mild' is misleading if people think that it is similar to the lay use of mild.

Studies like ours provide some evidence of the risks but clearly the benefits of participation sports need to be considered, including physical and psychosocial ones. One possible consideration for parents to ensure that schools and sport clubs follow official guidelines for a particular sport (e.g. not re-entering the field of play if having experienced a head injury during a particular match, and checking that good refereeing standards are adhered to as many head injuries occur during foul play).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is [Seena Fazel](https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/seena-fazel) and I am professor of forensic psychiatry at the University of Oxford. My research focuses on risk factors for adverse outcomes in neuropsychiatric disorders, and in particular in individuals with severe mental illness.

I recently published a paper titled [Long-Term Outcomes Associated with Traumatic Brain Injury in Childhood and Adolescence: A Nationwide Swedish Cohort Study of a Wide Range of Medical and Social Outcomes] (http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002103) in [PLOS Medicine](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/). We studied 1.1 million individuals born between 19731985 in Sweden, and followed up the 9.1% who sustained at least one traumatic brain injury before the age of 25 years to examine later risk of six medical and social outcomes. We found traumatic brain injury consistently predicted later risk of all examined outcomes even when we used their unaffected siblings as comparisons, and the effects were stronger for those with greater injury severity, recurrence, and older age at first injury. In particular, there were high absolute rates of psychiatric outcomes. These findings underscore the potential benefits of preventing head injuries in children and adolescents, and routine medical follow-up in certain subgroups.

**I will be answering your questions at 1pm ET. Ask me Anything!**

<TEXT> Eric: Of course, any time we consider altering something as complicated as an ecosystem, there are risks associated. The question facing us is whether these unknown risks outweigh the known risks associated with vector-borne diseases like Zika. At this point, localized efforts to eradicate a single species of disease-carrying mosquito may very well be worth the risk (and urgency). We seem to have seen enough cases in Brazil over the past year to warrant this type of response. This remains a highly contentious argument, and it is occurring in southern Florida as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eric: I would start off by saying that approximately 80% of Zika cases are completely asymptomatic. After the first human case was reported, an investigation of the members of that patient's community revealed that a high proportion of them exhibited evidence of Zika infection, but without any meaningful symptoms to report. So when we talk about risk, we can talk about risk of infection or risk of health impacts. Right now, the main group that should be concerned about health impacts is pregnant women, as microcephaly represents the primary threat that Zika poses. While there have been some suggested links between Zika and Guillain-Barr syndrome (from which both males and females of all ages could potentially suffer), this link remains somewhat tenuous in the literature and the risk remains much lower than that of microcephaly.

As for what those who are 'not at risk' can do, there isn't much except to advise pregnant women in affected areas to protect themselves against mosquitoes. Here are the CDC's recommendations: http://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/prevent-mosquito-bites.html </TEXT>

<TEXT> Colin: The models we do actually don't explicitly model cases, humans or mosquitoes. The way they work is they relate probability of a disease existing to environmental variables. The response variable is either a 0 or a 1 - points where we know Zika has existed are a 1, and "background points" from random spots in the environment are set as 0 (we call those "pseudoabsences"). Then we run a regression - or, something much more complicated that does the same job - and the output is just a prediction of whether or not Zika is "there". Niche models break down the ecology; and SIR models can tell us about the epidemiology once we know where to look! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Colin: This is a really important question and also one we are severely unqualified to answer, in the sense that our job in this paper, and as its communicators, is to tell you: this is one potential pandemic trajectory; there are other predictions; consensus exists in much of the tropics and controversy exists in most of the U.S. We can't directly advise interventions based on this type of model - that's the job of more epidemiologically minded folks. All those things said, broad strokes observations: pesticide spraying in areas with *no* predicted Zika occurrence or no Aedes are probably not great for human health or the environment, and there's already some visible consequences. Also I learned this last weekend that a lot of people involved in governmental response (domestic or international) have their hands somewhat tied in terms of recommendations re: access to safe and legal abortions in pregnancies with Zika-related complications. This is somewhat unfortunate given the importance of that issue.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Colin: When we talk about viral evolution in this paper and the other work we're doing, what we're really worried about is the idea that the "fundamental niche" (also called the "transmission niche" or the "Hutchinsonian niche" or the ... there's a lot of names) is sort of a black box that contains a bunch of different things - viral replication rates, transmission vector to human and human to vector, virulence, immune evasion strategies, vector specificity - that all mesh together into one overall geographic pattern. But viruses evolve faster than any other part of the system, and faster than most species we build niche models for. If there's strong selective pressure for viruses to push their thermal limits, the boundaries that keep transmission in the tropics might not be constant over the next 10-20 years. Those selective pressures are complicated and could be affected even by things like vaccination or vector switching.  

Can we forecast evolution? We can anticipate some broad patterns. (Here's a great place to start from one of my advisors: http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002236) But it's kind of hard to know exactly how evolvable a virus is without more molecular and empirical data. One thing we do know is that there's two explanations for Zika either spreading through Asia-Pacific regions to the Americas OR having been around in the Old World for a while, island-hopping and suddenly experiencing some sort of evolutionary or epidemiological release in Brazil. Whichever one of those ultimately proves to be true might give us some insight into whether rapid evolutionary changes (or even some simple mutations) are playing into how bad things got in Brazil (and why microcephaly showed up so seriously in Brazil). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eric: Winter months tend to decrease the activity of mosquitoes such that we would normally expect the spread of Zika to slow during winter. However, with a changing climate, we have seen increasing winter temperatures, so our predictions on this matter may not hold. We are also amidst a pretty severe El Nio event that may further complicate our predictions of mosquito activity during winter. 

As for introducing a new predator, most biologists would shy away from this type of biocontrol method, as we have seen time and time again that introductions of non-native predators often lead to unexpected outcomes (see the invasion of the introduced cane toad in Australia for just one of many possible examples). GM mosquitoes represent an alternative, targeted approach that would have a similar impact, but even this has been difficult to implement because of public concern. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Colin: Most of the work out there uses a mix of carcass data from wildlife and isolates from soil. (Human case data has a LOT of spatial bias folded in.) Anthrax is a nice model system for testing different disease mapping methods and I'm currently revising a paper for a PLoS journal about that, but on a broader scale the most interesting question to me is where anthrax hangs out in the soil - it's an environmentally transmitted disease in nature, and there's a bunch of cool geographic patterns that produces on a global scale. 

I think a collaborator of mine, Jason Blackburn, may have done some work with botulism but most of what he's done is anthrax and brucellosis. I don't know enough about botulism to really answer this! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eric: These are all good questions. As for the risk of an outbreak based on the transportation of a single mosquito, it is possible, though extremely difficult for us to prove. The large jumps we see between Southeast Asia and French Polynesia, and from there to South America suggest that transported mosquitoes or infected travelers are responsible. Differentiating between the two alternatives is tough. If the mosquito or traveller ends up in a climatically suitable location according to our model, it is certainly possible that it could become established.

Concerning tracking Zika through wildlife, there have not been a lot of concerted efforts to do this just yet. Since we are in the midst of an outbreak right now, the emphasis has not been on finding additional reservoirs. Humans (particularly asymptomatic ones) are the most populous affected species, and are therefore the most likely to serve as reservoirs for subsequent transmission.

At the time of our writing of this paper, there were twelve different species of mosquitoes that had been implicated as vectors of Zika. These included several Aedes species as well as some in other mosquito genera. Thus, it is not at outside the realm of possibility for other Aedes to serve as vectors. However, it is important to consider that Zika will not necessarily be transmitted throughout the entirely of a mosquito species's range, as their niches may differ.

Finally, it is unclear exactly what the relative roles of the two known transmission modes are at this point, but the fact that both exist suggest the the virus might have some evolutionary potential that we haven't seen yet (i.e., instead of occasional sexual transmission being a byproduct of immune evasion, it could become an actual transmission route that's part of Zika's evolutionary strategy). This early in the outbreak, we're still figuring a lot of this out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Colin: Great answer from s00permouse that covers most of the bases! As for parasite extinction and PEARL: in our other life, Eric and I are part of a team that measured the extinction rate parasites will experience in a changing climate, and we also published some of the most formal guidelines for how to actually conserve parasites (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12634/abstract). So actually, we spend a fair amount of time playing team #SaveTheParasites. But in this case, I think that the idea of eradicating mosquitoes globally that transmit human infectious diseases is a great but complicated idea. It's a lot like geoengineering - lots of promise, lots of margin for error, potentially impossible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eric: In this case, it was not really data limitations, but limitations in human knowledge, that prevented us from going back beyond 1950. The Zika virus was first discovered/named in 1947, so there were no human cases recorded before then. Of course, the more historical data, the better, but it also certainly complicates analyses in a lot of ways because the availability of one type of data (say, case reports) will not always be accompanied by other forms of data we need to perform the analysis (like climatic data). We felt pretty comfortable with the data available to us because we were confident that we had amassed a larger dataset than had ever been compiled for Zika and because our data was sufficient to use the methods we intended to use (namely, MaxEnt). </TEXT>

All this is in our methods section, but we georeferenced the data in GeoLocate, an online web app for georeferencing; and we run all our models in the R package BIOMOD2. The details on all the iterations are in the methods section of the paper - we did run some models with more iterations to check they converged though, and that's not in the paper. I'm writing a massive review on a similar topic right now (what are the actual best practices in disease niche modeling, and do we actually follow them?) and to be honest I'd love to do some more complicated statistics and more complicated comparison of Brazil data with the rest of the world (which we didn't have when we wrote the paper - actually, there weren't even cases in Florida yet when we made our first models). Bacterial diseases are a big mess. In my other life I map out anthrax and we need a whole other host of things to do that - more vegetation data, elevation, water flow data, LOTS of soil data.

I'm writing a paper right now that measures the actual threat Zika-related pesticide spraying poses to bees; what I can tell you right now is, it looks pretty bad as far as the honeybee industry might be concerned. Pesticides are important if Zika is actually around, because human health takes priority, but we need to strike a good balance between precautionary spraying and staying safe in areas where pesticides could ultimately have more human health impacts than Zika. (Maybe I'll be back when we finish that paper! That'd be fun!). But this is one of the reasons the maps we make are so important - they let us answer questions like that.

Our paper suggests that the risk in the Midwest is fairly limited, but then again other folks disagree. We're working on building a consensus right now; but I would say that while a single case might crop up here or there, if you don't have Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus locally you're probably going to be fine. As for the non-sexual transmission, that was an interesting case of potential contact transmission. Sexual cases are just one form of contact, and blood transfusions etc. can definitely transmit Zika. But as far as we know mosquitoes in Utah still aren't spreading Zika! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Colin: Thank you for this question! I would bet you what's in my pocket, which is $4 and a stick of gum, that we will never see anything quite like how bad things got in Bahia or in Colombia, anywhere in North America. We just don't have the vector density - and even in places we do, there's reason to think the kind of invasion epidemic we saw with Zika could be pretty out of the ordinary. That said, Zika will definitely be endemic in parts of the United States. In Florida we have a consensus; the Gulf, our models disagree slightly with others. As for the rest of the U.S., it's very unlikely except in the very, very rare circumstances that the virus does much better in a vector we don't know about (like a Culex mosquito), and there's some work doing predictions on that front, but I wouldn't panic about Canada right now certainly. 

As for medical recommendations, those are obviously banned in an AMA, but here's some vaguer musings: There's an obvious tradeoff between policy that is precautionary ("don't have children in affected areas"), which is becoming par for the course, and the basic social and bias-related problems inherent in that. Because I'm not a government funded researcher, I can also say that abortion restrictions are a really big deal in Brazil right now because of this, and this sort of issue figures into the Gulf Coast certainly where some of the laws may be a bit tighter, and personally I'm really worried about women having access to safe and legal abortions depending on how things go. If you live in the Gulf Coast and are thinking about getting pregnant, I would say (1) we don't have a scientific consensus whether Zika will be in the Gulf, big names and smart folks like Peter Hotez think it will, and I'm not willing to bet any child's life on my model being more predictive than others, so don't make life decisions based on that; (2) an OBGYN is a better person to talk to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eric: There is certainty the potential for Zika to spread in Florida. When we initially drafted this paper, there were not cases in Florida, at the time of publication, cases were confined to Miami-Dade and its surrounding counties. Since then, we have witnessed transmission outside of these areas, and it is definitely possible that it will continue spreading over the course of the year. It is also possible that the winter months in Florida will be cold enough to reduce mosquito activity. With increasingly warm winters as a result of climate change and the ongoing effects of the current El Nio event, we may not see the expected decline in mosquito activity. So the answer is really the unsatisfactory it depends.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Colin: Oh boy okay. As of a couple weeks ago when I was working on a talk, there had been a single death in the U.S. (not sure if there had been another since then) but a lot of media coverage calls Zika a "deadly virus". (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3562270/Mosquitoes-carrying-deadly-Zika-virus-reach-far-north-NEW-YORK-Nasa-risk-map-reveals.html) It's not. 80% of cases are asymptomatic. The reason we're really worried about Zika is microcephaly, and a little less so, potential neurological impacts to adults. (The jury still seems to be out on that). Also, big misconception: viruses can go anywhere their mosquitoes can go. They can't! Viruses have their own niche determined by a bunch of interactions in the "golden triangle" (host-pathogen-environment), that are pretty complicated but that we kind of summarize in a black box fashion with our models. If you want proof that viruses have their own niche, look at dengue - it certainly hasn't filled the full range of Aedes aegypti (that's why we put so much effort into mapping diseases!). So, if you live in upstate New York and in your travels you meet an Aedes aegypti, don't panic too much. As for dengue fever, that difference comes down to the fact that dengue and Zika are related but not the same. Their pathogenesis is different, Zika doesn't have the same big patterns (like dengue haemorrhagic fever and its four serotypes), and altogether what our paper shows is that if the data we have now is correct, Zika should have a much more limited niche than dengue. It was okay to use dengue as a proxy when we knew very little, but now that we have three different niche models in the literature for Zika (ours is only one third of the picture! but we love it like a favorite child), there's really no reason to use dengue models anymore, at least as far as niche models go. It's still sometimes helpful to borrow parameters from dengue for more complicated models in epidemiology though - there's an art to this as well as a science. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eric: There are, indeed, a number of other animals that are susceptible to the Zika virus. The virus was actually first discovered in 1947 in the Zika forest in Uganda (hence the name) in a rhesus monkey that had been placed in a cage in the forest to see what kind of diseases it would contract (cruel, I know, but the rules were a bit more lenient back then). The rhesus monkey is actually not native to Africa, so its infection is especially interesting. There are also reports of a number of other species exhibiting serological evidence of infection with Zika, from rodents and livestock to orangutans, zebra, and elephants! The potential for transmission to other species appears to be quite high, but little effort has been made to explicitly determine which species serve as the primary reservoirs of the disease. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eric: According to our assessment, there are a few small portions of the United States with the appropriate climatic conditions to support sustained (autochthonous) transmission of the virus. The major area of concern would be the southern tip of Florida where we have already witnessed a series of (non-traveller) cases. Our model, however, is not the only one out there, and each has a number of assumptions that others may overcome (while adding a few of their own). For this reason, we are currently working on a paper that considers the level of agreement we see between alternative models. The next step would be to develop a method for combining the results of different models, each associated with some degree of belief in their results, much like what Nate Silver and his group at fivethirtyeight.com do with polls during election season. Thus, the answer to you question is: the likelihood of endemicity within the US is relatively high because of the suitability of some places like southern Florida, yet the likelihood of endemicity throughout the entire US is extremely small. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eric: Thanks for your question! My answer here is directly related to a question below from u/briannasaurusrex concerning the impacts of spraying chemicals to combat mosquitoes in high-risk areas. The fact of the matter is that targeted interventions are exceedingly expensive, both in terms of time and money. Rather than using these targeted methods, we tend to spray pesticides relatively indiscriminately and we end up killing a lot of things that we dont intend to kill, like honey bees (http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/01/health/zika-spraying-honeybees/). One way to avoid these sorts of unanticipated impacts on ecosystems containing mosquito species that host Zika would be genetically modified mosquitoes. Of course, there are a lot of problems associated with the release of GM mosquitoes, though the advent of gene drive technology may represent one solution to some of these issues. A very interesting report from the National Academies (http://nas-sites.org/gene-drives/) on the use of gene drives says that we may not be at a point in its development that we can fight Zika, but there is still the potential to combat future vector-borne disease epidemics.

For a little more information about the impacts of completely eradicating the mosquito, this op-ed from the New York Times in 2003 offers a thought-provoking view (http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/25/opinion/a-bug-s-death.html)

<TEXT> Colin: To be honest it's definitely not good. Zika's doing so many things we had no idea it could do, and it raises a lot of pretty scary questions about sexual transmission. The good news is the papers that are out so far modeling the vector/sexual components point to pretty minimal impacts from the sexual side - check out this paper: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-016-0219-4 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Colin: Oh man, this is such a good question and it's very deep in the nitty gritty of this. A few things: (1) There's really no connection in the literature between niche theory and broad-scale community assembly patterns. I wish there were, but there's a massive disconnect. (By training I'm actually a community ecologist who got lost!) I know the papers you're talking about very well and even if there's not evidence that niche patterns are the strongest force structuring communities, niche models are still the premier and most well-validated method in spatial ecology for mapping species distributions, and there's no real evidence that they don't work. In fact, some great recent papers going back to basics have come out that validate these things. I'd point you to this really great study:
http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/685387
(2) Variance partitioning! Yeah, there's a bunch of very complicated methods for evaluation that are being developed in this kind of work right now but they all require sample sizes that are way beyond what we currently have for Zika. Down the road someday! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Colin: This is a great list and there's only a couple things I would add to it off the top of my head. Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever is spreading pretty fast and that's not great. Ebola, Marburg and some of the other filoviruses are still looming threats that we don't have good solutions for. The one that scares me the most personally though are coronaviruses, specifically MERS and SARS. We still don't have a good map of where SARS could come back from, and the current slow burn of MERS has hit a bunch of countries through travel. Respiratory diseases that are directly communicated like MERS and SARS are very, very scary since once they're in humans, they're not limited by climate so much.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Colin: Good morning from sunny Berkeley CA, where it's a lovely crisp 51 degrees! Thanks for having us today. We wanted to start with this one not just because it's the top question but because it's the cornerstone of what we want to talk about today. Starting from basics, we can only talk about infectious diseases (you're gonna need a public health person for the noninfectious ones!): a lot of diseases will get worse with climate change not just because of direct effects (i.e. gaining suitable habitat) but also because climate change exacerbates socioeconomic disparities, limits access to clean drinking water, and challenges our infrastructure. Vector-borne diseases will definitely expand a bit out of the tropics - many were cut back to tropical areas, like malaria (which used to actually get as far north as Norway, according to some folks), that are probably going to have the chance to spread a bit. Increased temperatures/precipitation can also definitely increase vector density and in some cases vector competence (how good is a vector at picking up, carrying, and transmitting a virus?), which has big ramifications for how VBDs - including Zika, dengue and others - will go. 

Direct-contact diseases will also get worse just because of some of those infrastructure problems, and shifting wildlife ranges will mean new patterns of human-wildlife contact that could mean new pathways for viral spillover into humans. But these things are overarching principles, and it's sort of like weather and climate; just because Climate Change Exacerbates Infectious Disease, doesn't mean every disease will benefit. Actually, angiostrongyliasis is probably going to lose some suitable habitat in the next few years.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Colin Carlson and I'm a PhD student at UC Berkeley in Environmental Science, Policy and Management. My research is focused on testing the relationship between climate change, biodiversity loss and the emergence of new diseases, usually in the context of spatial patterns on a global scale.

My name is [Eric Dougherty](
https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/eric-dougherty) and I am a PhD Candidate at the University of California Berkeley. My research focuses primarily on modeling the transmission of infectious diseases through wildlife populations.

We recently published a study titled ["An Ecological Assessment of the Pandemic Threat of Zika Virus"](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004968) in [PLOS NTDs](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/). The study aimed to use historical records of Zika presence from around the world to map the potential geographical extent of the current outbreak. We determined that the threat of vector-borne Zika is much greater in the tropics than in temperate regions like the United States or Europe, though a shift towards increased sexual transmission or evolution in the virus could alter these dynamics.

You can also see some of our other work, focused on parasite extinction in a changing climate, at [pearl.berkeley.edu](http://pearl.berkeley.edu/)!

In fact, some of the most fruitful and important collaborations happen by chance between people with distinct non-overlapping expertise - we just want to enable and encourage more of these. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Hilda] That's cool - I wish you much luck! One of the hardest things about all this is all of those co-authors etc who aren't equally committed. There's still a lot of activism needed. I think at least getting to know the open access movement is enormously helpful. At some point, you're going to need arguments to convince others - be it individuals you're working with, or for a policy perhaps. Knowing where to find data, policy papers, or just plain compelling writing in a hurry when you need it could really come in handy. This week is a good time to see who's out there and find organizations that suit your personal style. We need you!

I think where you make your data etc available matters too: [here's a good recent article](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005097) about this. One of those is storing information in open (non-proprietary) formats. And I believe that it's better to lean towards towards public platforms when you can: I've been around long enough to see things disappear or end up behind paywalls when they weren't to start with. Frustrating. We have to be in this for the long haul.

Then there are all the other ways you contribute to the knowledge development process. Where you put your peer reviewing effort, for example. That includes post-publication, where you don't have to wait to be asked, and can develop skills - as well as encourage people who are publishing openly.

I think blogging is another part of opening access to knowledge - anything that improves your ability to communicate with people, really. Share knowledge across spaces in your life and community.

Most of all, I strongly encourage becoming a Wikipedian, if you're not already. I think all of us should be "knowledge philanthropists" at the Wikipedia in the areas where we have expertise.

The use of preprints will continue to grow, and even for papers that are still published in subscription journals, we will often be able to find an open access preprint version.

The PLOS Data Policy will be increasingly adopted by other journals and publishers as part of the effort to improve reproducibility, and it will be expected that data are shared openly upon publication in repositories like DataDryad.

<TEXT> [Lenny] The reproducibility issue is indeed a very complex one. Some of the factors contributing to irreproducible research include: bad incentives, poor training, incomplete methods, missing data, messy biology, small sample sizes, variability in reagents/equipment, inappropriate application of statistics and p-hacking.

Obviously, no one effort can magically solve all issues with reproducibility. Changing our publishing culture so that we share the full details of the methods and make all of the data openly available - these can help a lot.

I am also a big fan of technical solutions that allow scientists to correct mistakes long after a paper has been published. More thoughts: "We can and should improve reproducibility. But it's not a crisis, so can do it without panic." (http://www.thespectroscope.com/read/we-can-and-should-improve-reproducibility-but-its-not-a-by-lenny-teytelman-309) </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Hilda] I agree strongly with the points Lenny made. But I think the argument people make about "capability" and the reading public misses the point. There are non-scientists who read articles that have a greater understanding of science than some of those publishing those articles, for a start. Whether it's journalists, people with a disease, or people advocating in an issue affected by science (like climate change), no one should underestimate our ability to get up to speed when we need to.

I used to be a consumer advocate in health. And there was no question that many patients, especially with rare conditions, were reading more science about the questions they faced than the doctors they were seeing. There are studies showing that a doctor will look only a few minutes for an answer to question: a patient could spend days looking and reading, learning as they go. And the statistical literacy even of many scientists is highly over-estimated: that's part of why we are seeing crises around reproducibility.

That said, one of the arguments I made in my [blog post](http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2016/10/25/between-sciences-secretive-elitist-past-and-open-accessible-future/) this week is that "access" has to also mean "accessible". There are imperatives for scientists in that, too. Science is becoming increasingly inter-disciplinary, and work has to be understood by a range of people with different jargons.

Secondly, there are lots of ways that science is being disseminated - with plain language summaries in journals (frustratingly sometimes behind paywalls!), in the media, blog posts, and more. If you want extra detail - a number, say, that isn't specified in the plain language version - and you're really committed to it, you can dig it out if the article is open access. Information spreads through communities: each and every person doesn't have to have personally read an article for the information to reach them by other channels.

One of the most important of those ways is the Wikipedia. [Wikipedia editors rely a lot](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/09/08/wikipedia-amplifying-impact-of-open-access/) on open access articles: partly because of their own access to them, and partly because citing them makes it easier for readers to verify what's in the Wikipedia article.

All that said, I think one of the obligations of the science community is to develop resources to help people understand their methods, their jargon, and the specifics of what they're doing. The public isn't going to be interested in everything of course: but I think there are more people under-estimating how much the public wants to read and understand than over-estimating it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Lenny] This is a tough one. You can see one of these roadblocks in the question here - having to pay article-publishing charges. Another key block is the pressure to publish in high-impact factor journals that are not OA.

Journals like PLOS Biology and eLife help to provide OA alternatives to the high profile work. Personally, I think the more important but harder shift is to move away from the obsession with the impact factor and the name of the journal where we publish.

<TEXT> [Hilda] I agree that the public has the right of access to the results of publicly funded research  and without the year-long embargoes that are common now. (Im speaking personally here, of course.) This is a tough problem. Journals rely enormously on the publications of publicly-funded scientists - and the subscriptions paid by publicly-funded institutions, too. Academics want the freedom to decide where they publish. Private journals are free commerce, with the rights that entails. This creates colossal practical and legal knots. And its an extremely important struggle of our times.

There are organizations like [Creative Commons]( https://creativecommons.org/) and [SPARC]( http://sparcopen.org/) advocating for legislation to address this, and even some whole countries trying to find a way to do it, in particular [The Netherlands]( http://www.openaccess.nl/en). And Joe Biden has been addressing open access to data and publications [Cancer Moonshot]( https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/06/06/fact-sheet-vice-president-biden-launches-open-access-data-resource-part), too.

Some funders are developing their own publishing channels, like [eLife]( https://elifesciences.org/) and [Wellcome Open Research]( https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/), too. I think were going to see more of that.

<TEXT> [Lenny] We are a crowdsourced platform and we rely on researchers to share their methods directly (before, during, or after they publish their paper).

Unfortunately, many if not most research papers, do not have detailed protocols included. Therefore crawling the materials and methods sections wouldn't really work. However, we are actively partnering with publishers so that they encourage authors to post their full protocols on protocols.io and then link to them from the methods sections. Examples:
GigaScience - http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/gigablog/2016/06/03/reproducible-research-resources-researching-parasites/

Genetics - https://genestogenomes.org/more-than-just-a-checklist-protocols-io-and-genetics-breathe-new-life-into-methods/

---------------------------------
Regarding OA publishing fees - I hear you. It is a maddening quirk in our publishing system that subscription papers averaging $5K/paper and unavailable to most seem cheaper than $1K-$2K of open access fees for papers that are then accessible to all. But it is absolutely true that the OA publication fee is a barrier to many researchers. In the long term, funders and publishers will figure out how to ensure that there is no penalty for publishing in OA journals (many working on that already).

Until we get to that point, I suggest posting your paper as a preprint on arXiv or bioRxiv. Then, even if it goes to a subscription journal, a free version is available. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Hilda] Well, I dont know about explaining like a robot, but Ill give the question a go from my point of view in clinical research. Back in the 1970s, researchers starting publishing protocols of their clinical trials as separate publications, and in the 1990s, that started happening with systematic reviews, too. Registries with some minimum protocol elements became mandatory for trials in the remit of the U.S. FDA, too.

Publishing protocols has had several repercussions. That whole area of p-hacking and coincidences have led us into a lot of unreproducible potholes. (Ive written a bit about that [here]( http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2016/04/25/5-tips-for-avoiding-p-value-potholes/).)  Pre-specifying the analyses youre going to make and rely on, makes us more likely to stick to the script  and at least it makes it clearer to others when researchers veer off their initial path.

Then theres the issue of being able to try to reproduce someones results  or even of using the results of research for practical purposes, like health care decisions. (A group of us have written about that [here]( http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c3852.long).) For that, you need a lot of detail. It takes a lot of discipline to keep enough detail going in real-time, so that you can reconstruct it later for a publication. Although it can be an enormous amount of work, its worth it in the end. See Florian Markowetzs, [Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly]( https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7).

On the robot side: not what you asked, but I think we all have to get better at working to be understood by, and visible to, machines. Thats everything from getting your ORCID so that you can be picked out from everyone else who has the same (sur)name/initials as you, through to open data and standardizing and including precise data the robots need. (Ive done a cartoon about that, with my post [here]( http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2015/10/19/why-arent-we-all-machine-friendly-researchers/).)

<TEXT> [Hilda] The situation for students worries me, too. I think institutions have a responsibility, here. They can  and should - negotiate cheaper rates with publishers. I dont know if any then waive the fees completely for students who get manuscripts accepted. Does anyone know examples like that?

Some universities are developing their own journals, like [University of California]( http://www.collabra.org/about/our-model/). With the cost of setting up journals coming down thanks to open source editorial management options, thats something more might do.

Another option is publishing a preprint. Some of those are going to get picked up by publishers, and it seems likely that more [overlay journals]( http://www.nature.com/news/open-journals-that-piggyback-on-arxiv-gather-momentum-1.19102) are going to appear - groups of scholars who reduce the cost and effort of publishing by piggybacking on the infrastructure of a repository. Academics and others are putting a vast amount of energy into providing editorial services at journals: I think well see more of them banding together to go down routes that dont require author charges. Thats the road that the [scholars behind the linguistics journal, Lingua]( https://www.wired.com/2015/11/editors-of-the-journal-lingua-protest-quit-in-battle-for-open-access/), went down.

Author charges wont be the only OA model in the future. Already were seeing funders develop their own publishing channels, like [Wellcome Open Research]( https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/). And theres the sign-up for life for one fee model at [PeerJ]( https://peerj.com/): if co-authors sign up too, that makes it more affordable.

And then there are several models where institutional libraries, instead of paying high subscription charges, band together to cover the costs of a publishing enterprise. Thats how the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]( http://plato.stanford.edu/support/) works, and the [Open Library of Humanities]( https://www.openlibhums.org/) too. 

Predatory journals arent free either, of course  its the author fees theyre preying on. A wider range of lower-cost models with sound editorial and academic credentials is going to help  as well as, hopefully, driving down author charges. Scholars could choose to exercise their market power, too, in a variety of ways, which would benefit students.

<TEXT> [Lenny] I say, "constantly, every day".

The reverse of this question is, "When did blocking someone from reading a research paper that they need help to speed up science and cures?"

There is also an enormous cost of subscription paywalls to society because of the inability of computer scientists to access the full body of literature automatically. Machine learning can tease out knowledge from papers, recommend relevant literature automatically to scientists, highlight reagents that are likely to work, and much more - all of this requires full access to all biomedical papers. Right now, companies doing the above are only sampling a fraction of total biomedical knowledge by analyzing PubMedCentral (papers from Open Access publishers like PLOS).

I know several scientists and companies that are using machine learning and relying on Open Access. So if you consider these efforts, OA is already helping to advance science in a meaningful way, but the power and utility of these would increase exponentially with full OA. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Lenny] Oh, how often I answer this question! (Usually, senior scientists and editors ask me this.)

First of all, there is a huge population of scientists who can understand and have to understand the papers for their research, but they do not have access. Not even the biggest and most well funded US research universities have access to every journal, and there are countless smaller schools whose libraries cannot afford subscriptions to most of the 25K-30K biomedical journals that exist. And when you move to poorer nations around the globe, they have talented scientists who are undermined and blocked from being productive simply because they cannot afford to access the published research.

Scientists aside, it is a misguided and elitist view that people without a PhD, outside of a research lab, do not need access to science papers. There are teachers in high schools, doctors, patients, journalists, and countless others who want, need, and would benefit from being able to access published papers. I think it is almost criminal that as a society we spend $10b a year on biomedical publishing, and the results are inaccessible to most.

There is a whole website actually devoted to answering this question: https://whoneedsaccess.org/.

Also, this brilliant classic video "Open Access Explained" presents a very clear, emotional, and convincing case for switching to full open access.

<TEXT> [Lenny] I share the full and painful details here (scroll down to "the story behind this protocol" https://www.protocols.io/view/Fixation-of-yeast-cells-for-RNA-FISH-fbjbikn?guidelines). 

In brief, I was doing research on gene expression in an interesting mutant yeast strain, using a single-cell microscopy technique to visualize RNA transcripts. When trying the technique on normal wild type yeast cells, everything worked beautifully and I saw beautiful spots representing individual molecules of RNA. However, when I would analyze the mutant strain that I was interested in, I saw nothing. This was puzzling as the yeast genetics lab that I collaborated with showed a lot of transcription happening in these cells, using a different classic technique (Norther Blot).

I first thought that the problem was me and I was making a mistake somewhere. In the end, it turned out that my cells responded to the stress by greatly expanding their cell wall. In order to do the microscopy, I needed to get probes with a dye into these cells to visualize the RNA. Because of the thick cell wall, my probes were simply failing to penetrate into the cells. I need more of the enzyme that digested the cell wall.

Finally, given my experience, I asked whether we were digesting the cell wall enough in our other experiment, in normal non-stressed strains and conditions. Turned out that we were only partially digesting the cells and our results were dramatically skewed by that. </TEXT>

<TITLE> PLOS Science Wednesday: Hi Reddit were Lenny Teytelman and Hilda Bastian, and we're here to answer your questions about open access publishing and new tools and methods to facilitate collaboration between researchers -- Ask Us Anything! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-26 14:09:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Lenny Teytelman and I am the CEO and co-founder of protocols.io. I am obsessed with creating a central open access place where scientists can share and discover up-to-date research methods. This is because I spent a year and a half as a postdoctoral researcher, discovering that a single step of the method that I was using was incorrect. Instead of a microliter, [I needed 5, and instead of a 15-minute incubation, needed a hour](https://www.protocols.io/view/Fixation-of-yeast-cells-for-RNA-FISH-fbjbikn?comments). Because this was a correction of a previously-published technique and not a new method, there was no way for me to communicate this knowledge to anyone else using the same protocol.

We recently published a community resource paper in [PLOS Biology]( http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/), describing our solution to the above problem [Protocols.io: Virtual Communities for Protocol Development and Discussion](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002538). We are working to improve science publishing and reproducibility of research by encouraging scientists to share the full details of their methods upon publication and by enabling them to keep these methods up-to-date, long after the papers are published.

And my name is Hilda Bastian, and Im a scientist and editor working at the [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/about/) at the [U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/about/) (participating here in a personal capacity: the views expressed are my own). Ive written a blog post at PLOS for 2016 Open Access Week on opening science to the community: [Between Science's Secretive, Elitist Past and Open, Accessible Future](http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2016/10/25/between-sciences-secretive-elitist-past-and-open-accessible-future/).

My hobbies are cartooning and blogging about science, [statistics]( http://statistically-funny.blogspot.com/), science publishing, and diversity. Im a [PLOS blogger](http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/), academic editor of [PLOS Medicine] (http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/), and member of PLOS ONEs [advisory group](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/advisory-groups) on human ethics.

In my day job, I work to make research on the effectiveness of health care accessible and understandable at [PubMed Health]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/), and support [PubMed Commons]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedcommons/), the [commenting system for authors in PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/). Im working towards a PhD in medical science, with an interest in systematic reviews and meta-analysis  the processes for finding and analyzing bodies of research and keeping up with a changing knowledge base. The final stage is studying the processes for correcting errors after papers are published, and what effect that has on the reliability of biomedical research.

I started out as a community activist and citizen scientist in the late 1980s in Australia, when the biomedical literature was almost completely locked away from the community in libraries. I was mostly concerned with making clinical and public decisions more science-based  and making biomedical research more relevant to the needs of patients and consumers. Then making scientific literature accessible became a major passion for me: not just available without charge to people who want to use it, but understandable and usable, too. I believe elitism and restricted access to doing and using science is sciences past, and our future is open, collaborative, and participatory. And I believe many of the skills of science are valuable for everyone.

<TEXT> The main implications are that giraffomorphs are a large and ancient group with complex biogeographic and evolutionary relationships. Yes, other giraffomorphs could have populated wider ranges of Eurasia but the only ones that we know to be strictly Eurasian are the palaeomerycids. Cranial appendages in ruminants appear as almost autapomorphic traits at the family level, with some exception. True antlers and proto-antlers are always two (in cervids and stem-cervids). However, multi-horned pecorans have appeared several times in parallel: palaeomerycids, giraffids, dromomerycids and hoplitomerycids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! 1- Since I was a child I was interested in nature, animals in general and later in dinosaurs. I am biologist, as well as many other biologists of my age, thanks to a TV program called El Hombre y la Tierra (The Mankind and the Earth) and its conductor Flix Rodrguez de la Fuente. Flix programs introduced to a broad audience the concepts of natural history and conservation in the early-middle 70s. Before I learned to read I knew the names of many animals thanks to his program. Flix created in us, the kids that were, a deep love for nature, and he is the reason why I got interested in zoology. 2- My tip is to enjoy this work whenever you can dedicate to it. Have an open mind, get rid of preconceptions and develop a critic mind. 3- I have collaborated with members of the ICP since long time ago. I recently got linked to them as a associate researcher. Paleontologists from MNCN (Madrid) and ICP (Barcelona) have a long history of association, we are the two main big groups involved in Tertiary mammals here in Spain. </TEXT>

Tragulids are a very primitive group of non-pecoran ruminants that still have extant representatives and almost nothing is known about their phylogenetic relationships.  They are very problematic and because that they are great  And regarding pecorans in general there is still a lot of work to do. Stem pecorans and cervidomorphs are two obvious targets.  </TEXT>

You know, to boldly go where no one has gone before  The cons the cons probably depend on the country you live. Here in Spain the science and research have been brutally undermined and many research teams in paleontology are in danger.

<TEXT> Genomics have added a very important source of data to the morphological studies. DNA and peptide sequencing are going to impulse new discoveries in the next decade. Paleontological species are a bit different to living species. Basically the fossil data are incomplete, and the intraspecific variability is usually unavailable due to the lack of abundant fossil specimens.  A paleontological species must be a terminal taxon with consistent autapomorphies. Fossil populations are a rare discovery in the fossil record. Here in Spain we have two of these unique examples when variability within single populations of extinct organisms can be studied: Cerro de los Batallones (Upper Miocene; Madrid) and Sima de los Huesos (Middle Pleistocene; Burgos). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Israel, and currently I am an associated researcher at the [ICP-Miquel Crusafont (Catalan Institute of Paleontology-Barcelona, Spain)](http://www.icp.cat/index.php/en/) and also collaborate with the Department of Paleobiology at the [MNCN-CSIC](http://www.mncn.csic.es/MainMenu/Research/Departments/Paleobiology/seccion=1220 idioma=en_GB.do) (Madrid, Spain). My research focuses on the evolution of ruminant mammals.

My colleagues and I recently published a paper titled [Systematics and Evolution of the Three-Horned Palaeomerycid Ruminants (Mammalia, Cetartiodactyla)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143034) in PLOS ONE. In this paper we explored the evolution of the large clade of ruminants of which the extant giraffes (Giraffa and Okapia) are the only living representatives. We named this clade the Giraffomorpha (the giraffe-like ruminants). We also tested the phylogenetic position of the strange-looking palaeomerycids, describing a spectacular new genus and species from Spain: Xenokeryx amidalae (named after the Star Wars character [Padme Amidala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala), read the paper to discover why). Contrary to what was previously thought we discovered that palaeomerycids were a Eurasian branch of giraffomorphs not related to cervids or North American dromomerycids (another group of strange-looking three-horned ruminants) as formerly believed.

I will be answering your questions from 1-2pm ET -- Ask Me Anything! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Steve - Clones are a good and a bad idea.  Most fruits that we eat are clones - that's how we get named varieties in the grocery stores - plus potatoes, sugar cane, dates and many others.  Preserving a particularly good combination of genes in a clone is a good idea.
Clones are not necessarily more of less susceptible to disease.  However, growing a clonal crop over a huge area means that any genetic variant in the pathogen population can be selected out and can then go through the entire population.  So from the point of diseases (or any other environmental problem such as global warming) growing clones in huge monocultures can be a very bad idea. </TEXT>

Igor: Biocontrol is one of the directions pursued in Ag when variants of soil fungi promote plant growth or attack pathogenic fungi (e.g., http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Mycoparasitic_fungi/).

Bananas respond similarly, despite the absence of seeds in triploids, and switch on an early ripening machinery that affects overall quality and prevent export. Hence, huge indirect costs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Steve - Cavendish actually was very resistant to Panama disease and it took quite a while before a new race evolved and became common enough to cause serious problems.
I work for the U.S . Government so everything I do is public domain.  If I found a real cure for black Sigatoka or Panama disease I would try to patent it if possible.  The reason is that companies are the ones who can bring improved products to consumers and they will only do that if patent protection can provide a potential profit.  If a new technology is not patented it is less likely to be used.  I know this sounds counter-intuitive but that is the reality.
However, this would not apply to small holders.  In addition to the huge commercial banana production, bananas and plantains are staple food for billions around the world who cannot afford to apply fungicides.  If we can find a way to help those growers then we would all be very happy. </TEXT>

This is absolutely unique. It is very susceptible to black Sigatoka though and now also to Tropical Race 4. Yes, we believe that GM/breeding is the way to go, and its feasible. We choose a different strategy than the conventional breeding programs, which will likely deliver more alternatives and faster. Everything we do is public, even when co-funded by companies.

<TEXT> Steve - Genetic engineering approaches could fix them both.  Part of the reason you see only Cavendish types is that the whole industry is organized around that cultivar - how to package it and how long it takes to ripen.  Other cultivars would require altering the entire transport chain so industry is reluctant to change.  Gert might have more information on this aspect.  One of my favorites is the "Apple" cultivar I think they call it in Hawaii - very nice flavor.  Apparently Gros Michel is still grown some in the highlands of Ecuador where it is a bit cold for Panama disease.  I tried to get some the last time I was there but couldn't find any. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Steve - Agronomic practices certainly can have a big effect but are not sufficient to eradicate the problem completely once it is established.  For example, in Australia the pathogen has been introduced a couple of times and as soon as it was noticed they immediately destroyed all bananas within a few miles of the outbreak and supposedly eradicated it.  This may be possible but difficult if you don't catch it early.  In Ecuador, they cut off infected leaves and put them on the ground with the upper surface down, since the spores are supposed to be produced only on the upper surface.  This can slow it down but it is still very difficult to produce bananas.  Agronomic effects are probably not large enough for effective disease management, unfortunately. </TEXT>

Igor: You are right, genomes are just a starting point and we are moving toward functional genomics to bridge the gap between the enormous number of sequenced genes and still relatively small number of genes with known function. JGI works with other DOE User Facilities like the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory ( http://bit.ly/User-Facility-JGI) to produce various omics types of data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, etc ) and analyze them.  The recent Facilities Integrating Collaborations for User Science (FICUS) initiative was established for this purpose. (More: http://bit.ly/JGI-FICUS). FICUS is all about expanding the diversity of datasets and connecting systems; for example, we worked with Michelle O'Malley at UCSB on sourcing cellulolytic fungal enzymes from zoo animal feces capable of degrading biomass more efficiently for fuel, generating metabolomic datasets (http://jgi.doe.gov/biofuel-tech-fungi-straight-from-the-farm/).

It has taken years of development to come up with these products. Without them we could presently not grow bananas. Whether we like it or not, these are the facts.

<TEXT> Steve - Yes, I think both approaches are needed.  The FHIA program has produced bananas with increased resistance so we know it works.  Genetic engineering will work in the future but getting around barriers to public acceptance will be the difficulty.  For example, for Panama disease, there is a report that Host-Induced Gene Silencing can control the disease, although it has not been tested in the field to my knowledge.  It also may be possible to use non-host resistance.  One result from the black Sigatoka genome sequence is that it contained effectors (proteins that facilitate disease) that could interact with tomato resistance genes.  Possibly genes from other edible crops that recognize the banana pathogen could be put into banana to increase its resistance. </TEXT>

I'm sure that we will have many more tools to reduce Fusarium in soil over the next few years. We can use genes from other plants in disease control strategies.

<TEXT> Steve - OK, that is several questions.  We often have collaborators in industry to work on basic science, including on our genome paper.  Industry sequenced the second genome.  Agrochemical companies are definitely interested in the genome sequence, for example to help design compounds that could target the pathogen specifically with fewer negative environmental effects.  Of course, our long-term goal would be to make chemicals unnecessary, but that is a long way off and many chemical companies also are into producing resistant plants.  Hopefully we can work together to reduce the amount of chemicals applied.

I have not heard of Jason Glaser - maybe Gert knows of him.

You can grow bananas in greenhouses now - production out of tropical areas is possible but yields are probably too low to make them commercially viable.  I have a dwarf banana I grow as a houseplant that has fruited several times so it is definitely possible to grow them outside of the tropics. </TEXT>

Funding presently is mostly in public private partnerships, thus governments (Netherlands), companies (global, not the "big guys" though), universities (Wageningen and others), institutions (JGI did a great job to support this work), private foundations/charity (Dioraphte in The Netherlands). </TEXT>

Igor: I suggest to look at molecular biology and bioinformatics. While genomics data become readily available from core lab facilities or commercial entities, bioinformatics skills remain critical for data analysis. In fact it requires more resources to assemble, annotate, and analyze genomics data computationally than sequence it. Frequently you are on your own facing tons of raw genomics data shipped to you. At JGI  we perform these computational tasks for every genome we sequence (jgi.doe.gov/fungi) but you still need to understand how the data were processed, to which extent you can trust the data, and what else you can do with it  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gert - It is not that easy, but yes smart genome management will result in new edible varieties with increased levels of resistance. However, I think it is better to start breeding at the diploid level to introduce much more diversity (taste, shelf life, productivity, disease resistance). The "addiction" to Cavendish is kind of worrisome. Consumers should have more options. That's where commercial breeding is all about. What does the consumer prefer? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gert - I don't think bananas will be extinct. Journalists like asking these questions, but the situation is of course very serious. Agronomically growing a suite of essentially identical clones around the world is asking for problems as banana history has shown already once before (Panama disease epidemic previous century). History repeats it self and hence we need to come up with solid strategic solutions. Prime target is to introduce genetic diversity - new varieties - to slow prevent and manage epidemics. This takes many yeas of R D and meanwhile we need to implement other management options. 50-70 fungicide applications to manage black Sigatoka is very unsustainable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


We're Igor Grigoriev, Steve Goodwin and Gert HJ KEMA, and we recently published an article titled [Combating a Global Threat to a Clonal Crop: Banana Black Sigatoka Pathogen Pseudocercospora fijiensis (Synonym Mycosphaerella fijiensis) Genomes Reveal Clues for Disease Control](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005876) in [PLOS Genetics](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics).


[Gert HJ Kema](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gert_Kema), Professor of Tropical Phytopathology at Wageningen University, The Netherlands, researches fungal diseases in banana and wheat, with a focus on genetic diversity and mechanisms of pathogenicity of the causal agents.


[Igor Grigoriev](http://jgi.doe.gov/about-us/organization/eukaryote-super-program/igor-grigoriev/), Head of Fungal Genomics program at the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute and [Adjunct Professor of Plant and Microbial Biology](http://plantandmicrobiology.berkeley.edu/profile/igrigoriev) at University of California Berkeley, employs genomics tools to explore fungal diversity for energy and environment science and applications.


[Steve Goodwin](https://www.ars.usda.gov/people-locations/person?person-id=2061), Research Plant Pathologist with the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and [Adjunct Professor of Plant Pathology](https://ag.purdue.edu/btny/pages/profile.aspx?strAlias=sgoodwin) at Purdue University, uses genetics, genomics and bioinformatics approaches to analyze host-pathogen interactions between wheat and fungal pathogens and to utilize genetic diversity in hosts and pathogens.


The [PLOS Genetics article](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005876) focused on determining the DNA sequence of the fungus and applies it by focusing on two major aspects of current banana production: overall susceptibility of the crop and reduced efficacy of disease control agents (fungicides). The overall susceptibility of the major export Cavendish banana varieties - that essentially form one huge monoculture around the globe - is the underlying problem of the unsustainable banana production. Hence, the only way to manage black Sigatoka is the use of fungicides. However, due to the high application frequencies (between 50-70 times per year) their efficacy continually decreases, which in turn requires more/different control strategies. Our paper unveils the unsustainable status quo by showing the need and possibility for developing new and better varieties with improved disease resistance. This helps growers in the developing world and meets consumer demands for a caring society.


To learn more about the featured study, read Gert's PLOS Blogs post on [Biologue](http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2016/08/12/one-super-susceptible-clone-a-versatile-fungus-and-failing-fungicides-black-sigatoka-and-banana/).

2. So we've published lots of papers showing how fibroblasts coupled to myocytes cause arrhythmias in various cultures and other reduced preparations.

<TEXT> Not at all. I personally think the concept of synchrony is probably the most important single concept in dynamics, that is, everything. The synchrony is achieved in the heart through gap junctions, which are the connections from one cell to its neighbors. These then support a wave conduction that passes through the tissue like a stadium wave. In VF, this wave becomes unstable and fragments itself. See our paper
Preventing ventricular fibrillation by flattening cardiac restitution. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 97, 6061-6066. (2000)

The problem of VF, the leading cause of sudden cardiac death, can be put totally mathematically: there is this Partial Differential Equation, which is known, governing cardiac conduction. If that PDE in your heart currently has a rectilinear solution, you are healthy; if it has a periodic solution, you are very sick, and if it has a chaotic solution, you are about to die!

<TEXT> Alan: What you say is true: current standards for implanting an ICD place importance on the EF. But there is absolutely no mechanistic connection, to my knowledge, between "low EF" and "arrhythmia". "low EF" is a marker for advanced disease, and then you are also at risk for arrhythmias, but I don't know the connection. Of course, as you well know, ACE targeting is supposed to address contractility, and BB is supposed to be anti-arrythmic. One very interesting recent development is the role of autonomic (parasym and sympathetc) innervation of the heart as a cause of arrhythmia. See my colleagues work, for example 
The role of the autonomic nervous system in sudden cardiac death
M Vaseghi, K Shivkumar - Progress in cardiovascular diseases, 2008

<TEXT> Alan: 1) current situation for HF is based largely on hemodynamic measures like Ejection Fraction and treated with drugs to improve that situation. Our focus was on electrical arrhythmias in this population, which is a known problem but whose mechanism are unclear. 
2) your question about types of HF is a good one. There are definitely distinct types of HF: HFpEF, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and a few others. We are focussing on HFrEF (r = reduced), and we really have no idea whether this would also hold true of entities like hypertrophic CM. 3) see Cardiac inotropes: current agents and future directions.

I recently published an article [Electrophysiology of Heart Failure Using a Rabbit Model: From the Failing Myocyte to Ventricular Fibrillation](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004968) in [PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/). Previously, I had published an article [Simulation methods and validation criteria for modeling cardiac ventricular electrophysiology](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114494).


Both papers use a large-scale model of electrical conduction in the heart. The PLOS ONE [paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114494) addresses the question of verification of a whole heart electrophysiology model: what reality criteria does a model have to meet? We propose a series of these, and describe a model that satisfies them.


The PLOS Computational Biology [paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114494) develops this model, and creates a version modeling the electrophysiology of heart failure. We show that the altered cellular conditions known to be present in heart failure predispose the heart to a greater risk of ventricular fibrillation, the leading cause of sudden cardiac death.

<TEXT> We did examine sex as one of more than 700 potential predictors of progression from MCI to AD. However, our analysis was not designed to identify every possible predictor of MCI-to-AD progression but rather to identify a small number of predictors that, when used together, maximized the accuracy of the prediction. The best performing model incorporated scores from cognitive/functional assessments and structural MRI measures and predicted progression with 80% accuracy. Although sex may have an effect on the rates of cognitive and functional decline, as suggested by Lin et al. (2015), our analyses did not identify sex as a unique predictor that added significant predictive information over and above the other included predictors. It's possible that the effects of sex are already in part reflected in the cognitive / functional assessments and brain MRI measures that were selected as predictors in our model (i.e. predictive information provided by sex may be redundant). Alternatively, it's possible that sex was not identified as a reliable predictor of progression in our study because we used a different dependent variable than Lin et al. Because we used a binary outcome variable (clinical diagnosis of progression or no progression from MCI to AD dementia), as opposed to a more fine-grained outcome variable such as scores on a specific cognitive or functional assessment (e.g. ADAS-Cog, CDR) as used by Lin et al., our approach may not have been sensitive enough to identify sex as a predictor of progression. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for your comments/question.

Several research studies have examined the utility of cognitive tests, brain imaging, and blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for predicting the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. No single test or biomarker has been shown to have very high predictive accuracy, and it is likely that a combination of different types of tests/biomarkers will be necessary for accurate prognosis. When we wrote the article, other researchers who analyzed the ADNI-1 dataset reported models with prediction accuracies of 65-80%, depending on what biomarkers were analyzed, how long the time frame for prediction was, and the analysis methods used. MCI has been viewed as a transitional "at-risk" stage in clinical practice, but just using the diagnosis of MCI to predict the development of future dementia or AD is not a reliable approach. To my knowledge, no test for predicting progression to dementia has been widely used clinically. Accurate early diagnostic (or prognostic) approaches are critical in the fight against Alzheimer's disease (AD). The research community has shown convincing evidence that AD likely begins at least a decade (and likely longer) before the onset of symptoms. By the time a person with AD starts to show symptoms, there are significant, irreversible brain changes. Therapies for preventing and/or slowing down the degeneration caused by AD are likely to work best when initiated early in the disease course. Certainly, the tests must be reliable enough to identify with high accuracy people who will likely develop AD or dementia (so that they can be treated early). However, ideally, the tests should also not falsely identify healthy people as having AD or an increased risk of developing dementia. AD therapies, as most treatments, may have side effects and should probably be limited to people at high risk for developing AD based on accurate prognostic / diagnostic tests. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your question. Regardless of age, all of us experience moments of forgetfulness at times (e.g. misplacing the keys or forgetting a person's name). However, if the episodes of "forgetfulness" are becoming more frequent and bothersome, and in particular, if a person's function is affected by the forgetfulness (activities of daily living such as doing finances, remembering appointments, driving, shopping etc.), an evaluation by a doctor may be necessary. Neuropsychological or cognitive tests can be used to formally assess a person's cognitive function in various areas (memory, attention, language, visuospatial function), as compared to healthy people of similar age and educational level in order to determine whether there is cognitive impairment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for your excellent questions!

1. The progression rate from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) varies with the type of MCI. Specifically, people with amnestic MCI who have memory loss develop AD at a greater rate than those who have non-amnestic MCI (where the predominant cognitive deficits are of the non-memory type, e.g. attention, language, visuospatial function, etc). In our study we analyzed data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which recruited people with amnestic MCI within a research setting and generally from specialty memory disorder clinics. People with MCI in research- or specialty clinic-based settings tend to have a greater rate of progression (7-15% per year) as compared people with MCI living in the community (3-8% per year in some studies). Thus, the group of people recruited in the ADNI and other similar studies tends to be enriched with people at greater risk of developing AD. Thus, there is a limitation in generalizing the results from our study and other work based on ADNI data to the larger population. For various reasons described in our paper, we also did not include every person with MCI from the ADNI dataset in our analyses. Thus, the overall progression rate from MCI to AD cannot be estimated based on the data we used in the paper.

2. Our model for predicting which MCI patients will progress to AD dementia was most accurate when using cognitive and functional assessments (i.e. paper-and-pencil tests) and a brain MRI scan. In the clinical setting, AD and MCI are diagnosed using a medical history, physical and neurological examinations, and neuropsychological testing. Some version of cognitive/functional assessments and a brain MRI scan are generally already obtained by a neurologist or psychiatrist as part of the evaluation of cognitive impairment, so there should be limited additional cost associated with obtaining the data. There may be costs associated with the software to analyze the MRI scan or administration and scoring of the cognitive/functional assessments. However, our model and similar published models still need to be validated and translated into clinical practice -- they are not yet ready for prime time!

3. At this moment, the only FDA approved treatments for Alzheimer's disease are for symptomatic relief only. There are no approved treatments available that prevent or slow the progression of AD, but there are several ongoing clinical trials testing these new "disease-modifying" AD therapies. The use of the prognostic model would be to identify patients who are at greatest risk of progression to AD for participation in clinical trials. This type of prognostic tool is not quite ready for clinical practice yet. As far as informing patients and their families of the future risk of Alzheimer's disease, without the current availability of disease-modifying therapies, that's a highly controversial issue from an ethical standpoint. In some cases, knowing this information may help patients and their families plan for the future, but this issue must be considered on case-by-case basis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for your question, and I'm sorry to hear about your grandmother. Generally, research on the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has focused on older adults who are 60-90 years old, as is the case of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, which collected the data we used in our work. The most common form of AD, known as sporadic AD (as opposed to familial AD), occurs rarely prior to age 65, and its risk grows with increasing age. Thus, research studies attempting to identify biomarkers and develop new diagnostic methods have focused on this age group. However, there is a growing recognition that AD may begin a decade or more before the symptoms begin. Thus, there are increasing efforts to develop new diagnostic methods and to conduct preventative clinical trials in people who show no symptoms of cognitive decline but may be at risk for developing AD (e.g. genetic risk factors or based on early changes seen on brain scans or laboratory tests). This is a very exciting, rapidly developing but challenging area, and much work remains to be done on both the research and the clinical sides. One such clinical trial is the A4 study (http://a4study.org). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Igor Korolev, and I am a resident physician in psychiatry at the [University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital](http://uhealthsystem.com/locations/jackson) (previously a D.O./Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University). My research focuses on using various methods such as neuroimaging and cognitive tests to develop novel approaches for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (or alternatively for identification of people at risk for developing dementia due to Alzheimer's disease).

I am the lead author of a research article titled, ["Predicting Progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Dementia Using Clinical, MRI, and Plasma Biomarkers via Probabilistic Pattern Classification"]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138866), published in the journal [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/). This work was co-authored with my mentors, Andrea Bozoki, an academic neurologist, and Laura Symonds, a neuroscientist, at Michigan State University.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be a transitional phase between normal cognitive aging and dementia. We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and computer algorithms (referred to as machine learning) to design a model for predicting whether a person with MCI will develop dementia due to Alzheimer's disease over a three-year period. Our model was able to predict future progression from MCI to Alzheimer's-type dementia with 80% accuracy using information from cognitive and functional assessments and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The model utilizes widely available, cost-effective, non-invasive methods and can be used to improve patient selection in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease therapies as well as to identify high-risk MCI patients for early treatment.

<TEXT> We know from stomach content analyses that thresher sharks like prey items that aggregate in shoals (sardines and squids for example).  Since we have no evidence that the unique tail design has any other function than to hunt and locomote with, my suspicion is that tails and tail-slapping coevolved in response to the defensive schooling behaviour of their available/preferred prey. In this context we might consider tail-slapping to be an efficient strategy since thresher sharks are able to debilitate and consume more than one  prey item at a time (we observed up to seven).

<TEXT> Tail-slapping of course!  In sharks, this behaviour is unique to the alopiids (thresher sharks) and might be considered interesting for a variety of reasons.  For instance, while we were analysing our video data, we noticed plumes of bubbles being released into the water column at the apex of the arc that formed the travel path of the tip of the tail for many of the tail-slaps that we observed.  Tail-slaps appear to occur with such force that they cause dissolved gas to diffuse out of the water column in a fluid dynamics process known as cavitation.  Unfortunately we were unable to report the intricacies of this process due to very valid points raised by our reviewers.  However, I remain convinced that localised explosions caused by cavitation play a part in the relative efficiency of this unusual hunting strategy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not exactly.  It has indeed long been speculated that thresher sharks hunt with their tails.  In fact the first description of thresher shark hunting behaviour dates back to 1923 when Allen published surface observations that he made from a pier of what he thought was a common thresher coach whipping a California smelt in Science.  Decades later Aalbers et al. (2010) showed that under controlled conditions common thresher sharks were able to make contact with tethered bait using their caudal fins. While it has been suggested that bigeye and pelagic thresher sharks employ similar methods of hunting to those described for common thresher sharks, the kinematics that structure alopiid predatory behaviours in the wild have not been previously documented. The novelty of our paper stems from the analyses that we undertook of thresher sharks interacting with natural prey in the wild.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is [Simon Oliver](https://www.chester.ac.uk/departments/biological-sciences/staff/dr-s-oliver) and I am a marine ecologist at the University of Chester. My research focuses on using integrated approaches to understanding animal behaviour in the context of their use of habitats, ecological services, cooperation, and predator-prey interactions. I am particularly interested in the behavioural ecology of oceanic sharks in response to their cleaning, hunting, and migration strategies, and applying associated behavioural knowledge to address conservation issues.

I am the lead author of a 2013 paper in PLOS ONE titled [Thresher Sharks Use Tail-Slaps as a Hunting Strategy](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067380). Unique to their taxa it has long been suspected that thresher sharks use their tails to corral and stun their prey. Although some empirical evidence for this unusual hunting strategy has been quantified from controlled experiments, descriptions of the behaviour and its association with the capture of live prey have remained vague. While we were studying the cleaning ecology of pelagic thresher sharks in the Philippines, my co-authors and I came across a site where they could be regularly observed hunting sardines. Knowing that we had stumbled upon the Holy Grail of thresher shark behavior, we designed a simple set of experiments show beyond doubt that thresher sharks really do hunt with their tails.

If we increased antigens amounts x1000 fold in flu vaccines, there would likely be increased inflammation, etc.  So, the best option is to include a decent amount of antigen from a few strains, rather than a little bit of antigen from many strains. </TEXT>

At our [lab]( https://www.wistar.org/our-science/scientists/scott-e-hensley-phd), we are particularly interested in figuring out how viruses evade antibody responses.

We recently published a study titled [Antibodies with Original Antigenic Sin Properties Are Valuable Components of Secondary Immune Responses to Influenza Viruses](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005806) in [PLOS Pathogens](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens). In this study, we used a mouse model to show that antibodies stimulated by past influenza virus infections can help fight against new antigenically distinct influenza viruses, despite binding poorly to these new viruses. We propose that these antibodies, classically termed original antigenic sin antibodies, are an important component of secondary immune responses against influenza viruses.

There are very good reasons to protect bats, not only out of regard for the natural world, but also because they play important ecological roles which are crucial to humans. Insectivorous bats are the most efficient and natural insecticide, and fruit bats are important pollinators. 
We believe that controlling disease can be better achieved by reducing contact between wildlife and people or domestic animals, and, when possible, using vaccines (there is now an efficient Hendra vaccine for horses in Australia). </TEXT>

1. The difficulty varies greatly among bat species and environments. In Africa, large colonies (sometimes 1 million bats) form every year and then disperse again, and they're very difficult to track. A good monitoring programme was put in place in Australia, collecting urine on large plastic sheets under roosts, allowing virus detection. So we can get reasonable estimates of the prevalence of viruses in particular bat species, but it's hard to tell exactly how many bats carry the virus. But sometimes we cannot detect the virus even though bats have antibodies that indicate they have been infected recently. It could be that the virus is present in small numbers in bats and not always shed.

2. Culling bats has been advocated by policymakers and politicians in several countries, but scientifically it's not a good solution. First, it's very hard to carry out: bats fly away as soon as you try to shoot, catch or smoke them, so you're just moving the problem to a different location. This can easily worsen the problem, especially if stress increases shedding of viruses (which is likely). Second, bats provide very important ecological services, from pest control (insectivorous bats) to pollination and seed dispersal (for fruit bats). So the longer-term cost would outweigh the short-term benefit. We are working on alternative solutions, which can involve vaccines and reduction of bat-human contacts.

3. There is currently a large research effort on WNS, including the use of models. The problem is different because WNS has a lethal effect on bats, unlike the viruses we're studying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Raina] See my answer to one of the earlier questions regarding bat immunology. I'll also add to my answer: some recent work by Michelle Baker's group at CSIRO in Australia found that bats have a high baseline level of innate immunity. She eloquently describes the paradoxes of bat immunity in a popular press article here: https://theconversation.com/why-bats-dont-get-get-sick-from-the-deadly-diseases-they-carry-55012.
The conservation issues are real and important. Bats are critical for healthy landscapes. We also show that culling and dispersal, in some situations, may make virus spillover worse. Some nice work by Dan Streiker on vampire bat rabies also predicts that culling could make things worse: http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1742/3384.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Raina] Marburg virus has been isolated from bats on a number of occasions. CDC has done some good viral ecology work on Marburg virus, showing that it persists in populations of Rousettus aegyptiacus bast in Uganda. Ebola has not been isolated from bats, however, there are many lines of evidence that suggest that bats are reservoirs (widespread antibodies in bats, successful infection of bats with Ebola in the laboratory without seeing disease, epidemiological connections between bats, seroprevalence and disease, and discovery of Ebola RNA in bats). </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Olivier] This question received a lot of attention during the latest Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where the consumption of bat bushmeat was quite common, and bans were rapidly put in place. However, the evidence is still scarce. Before the outbreak, my PhD student Alexandra Kamins carried out a detailed survey of bat bushmeat in Ghana, which unravelled a major trade business across the country. We think that consumption of bat bushmeat, which is usually thoroughly cooked, poses limited risk of infection, unlike hunting and butchering activities. However, we didn't find any evidence of exposure to bat viruses in hunters in Ghana.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Raina] Bats are getting some bat publicity with all the talk of viruses. However, we think that human activities are contributing to spillover -- for example, in Australia, flying foxes (fruit bats) have lost much of their native forest habitat since European settlement, and are increasingly using urban and peri-urban areas for feeding, thus increasing their contact with horses (the intermediate host of Hendra virus). These bats are important pollinators, as their distribution shifts into peri-urban areas we are losing the important ecosystem services they provide. We need to find solutions that allow bats to continue to migrate and pollinate native forests, and such solutions may also decrease the risk of virus spillover. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Raina] You are correct. There is no documented spillover of Hendra virus directly from flying foxes to humans--all cases have had a horse intermediate host. Nipah virus, similarly spilled over from bats to pigs and then humans, but is now understood to also be directly transmitted from bats to humans through drinking contaminated date palm sap in Bangladesh. Our paper in PLOS NTD examines the dynamics of these viruses in bat populations. When the prevalence of virus (proportion of bats infected) is high in bat populations, the risk of spillover can also be high --whether this is spillover to horses grazing in paddocks, humans drinking date palm sap, or humans entering a cave with Marburg infected bats. The research methods needed to understand viral prevalence in bat populations are similar in all of these systems. The research needed to understand the human behavioral and immunological aspects of spillover is, however, specific to each system (e.g., horse grazing behavior for Hendra virus, human date palm sap consumption for Nipah virus in Bangladesh, etc.). </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Olivier] 1. As far as we know, bats seem to tolerate most of the viruses that have been studied recently in relation to spillover. Rabies and related viruses, which kill any infected animal within days, are not always lethal to bats: some of them survive and develop protective immunity. White Nose Syndrome, which is caused by a fungus, is one of very few diseases of bats known to cause a substantial toll on populations. My colleagues have recently reviewed historical records of large mortality events in bats around the world, and very few seem to have been caused by disease: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mam.12064/full

2. Persistence of viruses within bats is a hypothesis under investigation, as discussed in our paper (see link at the top of this page), but evidence is still limited, due to practical constraints.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Raina] I think it is important to put the danger in perspective. We are all full of microbes, and the air we breathe is full of microbes from many other species. Every time we pat our dog or cat we are exposed to microbes. But very few of these microbes cross species barriers and cause disease. Probably because we have very effective immune barriers to pathogens. There is also growing evidence that early exposure to pathogens may be beneficial. But I do agree, the more you know about the scary but rare pathogens, the more it clouds our perception of the real risk of infection.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Olivier] There are a few known examples, and probably many unknown cases. Nipah virus in South-East Asia is transmitted from bats to pigs, and the closely related Hendra virus in Australia infects horses. Transmission is thought to occur when bat urine contaminates drinking water for animals in fields. Hendra is lethal to horses, while Nipah causes less severe disease in pigs. MERS coronavirus, which is probably spread by Rousettus bats, infects camels. Ebola virus has caused deadly outbreaks in gorillas, and is seen as a major threat to endangered apes in Africa. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Raina] There is a growing understanding that bats may have an unusual immune system that allows them to carry viruses without experiencing disease. Their special immune responses may be a consequence of adaptations for flight. Bats must increase their metabolic rate up to 16 fold to fly (compared to birds who increase metabolic rate two fold). To deal with high metabolic rates bats must deal with the byproducts of oxidative metabolism. Recent work suggests that they evolved mechanisms to deal with oxidative stress that also happen to help them deal with intracellular pathogens, such as viruses. Another hypothesis that we described recently is the "flight as fever" hypothesis -- that bats increase their body temperature during daily flight, and this may drive selection for lower virulence pathogens (fever is a mechanism the body uses to fight pathogens). </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. [Olivier] Only bats in temperate regions hibernate, and these tend to carry fewer diseases. Research from our colleagues in Colorado has shown the hibernation may help rabies virus (which is found in a small number of bats) persist in bat populations through the winter. White Nose Syndrome, which affects only bats, is thought to exhaust bats' energy during hibernation, but I'm not up to date with the latest research on WNS.

2. [Olivier] Before going beyond "the obvious" variables, we need to estimate them properly, which is not easy when dealing with animals that can fly over long distances in inhospitable regions. We try to combine different sources of information on populations (density, migration patterns, reproduction, all of which vary seasonally) and individuals (age, health, presence of antibodies indicating current or past infection...). Disease transmission itself is particularly hard to measure, as we can only detect it after the fact.

<TEXT> [Olivier] The identification of a disease "reservoir" is a long and uncertain process, it's a real whodunnit! For Ebola, the virus has been found in a small number of animal species, including apes and bats, so they're our usual suspects. If not the virus itself, we can find antibodies in some bats, which show that these animals must have carried the virus at some point and survived. And there is also anecdotal evidence that the latest Ebola outbreak in West Africa started in a village where bats were roosting, and the "index case" is thought to be a child who may have come in contact with a bat soon before getting sick. For Marburg, Hendra and Nipah viruses, the evidence is much clearer. I recommment reading David Quammen's excellent book "Spillover" to find out about these. 
We and others are now studying African bat species to understand how they respond to and transmit these viruses, so that we can better estimate the risk to people, but it's not an easy task, as you can imagine. I don't do fieldwork myself, but my colleagues wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, face masks) when handling bats, depending on the species. And they get vaccinated against rabies before starting field work, as a precautionary measure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is [Raina Plowright](http://bzndiseaselab.org/) and I am an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at Montana State University. I use field, lab and modeling approaches to understand how pathogens persist in wildlife populations (especially bats) and spill over to humans. And my name is [Olivier Restif](http://www.infectiousdisease.cam.ac.uk/directory/or226@cam.ac.uk) and I'm a Lecturer in Epidemiology at the University of Cambridge. I use mathematical models to track the spread of microbes within their hosts and across populations. In particular, I'm trying to find out how the ecology of African bats may contribute to their ability to spread viruses.

We recently published a paper titled [Transmission or within-host processes driving pulses of infection in reservoir hosts](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004796) in [PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/).

We examine the dynamics of emerging bat infections within their reservoir host populations. We argue that understanding the mechanisms that drive pulses of excretion of viruses such as Hendra, Nipah, Ebola and Marburg viruses, is essential to predict or manage spillover risk. We outline an ambitious multidisciplinary research agenda that would allow better management or even prevention of spillover.

<TEXT> Niels here: yes, this is indeed possible. For example, in research genetically engineered viruses that contain snippets of RNA or DNA that match part of host plant genes of interest can be used to infect these plants to manipulate the expression of these genes. 

Fascinatingly, naturally occurring viruses sometimes also contain sequences in their genome that match host plant genes. In some of these cases viruses use this similarity to subvert host plant immunity by "silencing" the expression of plant defense genes. 

As long as the genetically engineered information does not target genes that are necessary for the plants well-being and the virus itself does not cause severe symptoms in the plant, genetic information can be delivered via a "mild" virus without harming the host plant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Niels here: symbiosis is a catch-all concept for relationships that could be described with more detailed terms such as commensalism (no benefit to either partner), mutualism (both partners benefit), parasitism (one partner benefits at the expense of the other, but does not kill the other immediately) or predation (one partner benefits at the expense of the other after killing the other). In many cases species relationships could be in or switch to either status dependent on the genotypes of the partners and/or the environment. In the case of the plant-virus-pollinator interaction in our paper, the relationship between the virus and susceptible plants seems to show signs of mutualism when pollinators are present, but parasitism (in favour of the virus) when pollinators are absent.  </TEXT>

Cucumber mosaic virus, an important pathogen of tomato, causes plants to emit volatile chemicals that attract bumblebees - bumblebees are important tomato pollinators, but do not transmit this virus. We propose that under natural conditions, helping host reproduction by encouraging bee visitation might represent a payback by the virus to susceptible hosts.

I recently published a study titled ["Fragment Length of Circulating Tumor DNA"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006162) in [PLOS Genetics](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/). Detection of cell-free DNA derived from tumor cells (i.e., circulating tumor DNA) against the background of naturally occurring cell-free DNA from healthy cells has proven challenging. This has been particularly difficult in non-metastatic solid tumors as circulating tumor DNA has been heretofore indistinguishable from normal cell-free DNA except for the occurrence of mutant alleles that commonly occur at a frequency below detection limits. Our study found a distinct size difference in DNA fragment length between circulating tumor DNA and cell-free DNA. We were subsequently able to exploit this difference in fragment length size to enrich samples for circulating tumor DNA. This finding may provide the opportunity to substantially improve the sensitivity of detecting circulating tumor DNA and broaden the clinical utilization of circulating tumor DNA for diagnosing and monitoring cancers.

The goal of our study was to examine the factors contributing to moose's range expansion across the Alaskan Arctic during the 20th century. We accomplished this largely by estimating available moose habitat -- tall shrubs along rivers and streams -- during the late 1800s. We showed that moose habitat was greatly reduced during the 1800s, when moose were absent from the region.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Nick Wareham and I am Director of the [MRC Epidemiology Unit](http://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on the genetic and environmental determinants of type 2 diabetes and the translation of epidemiological knowledge into preventive action. I also served as a [guest editor](http://collections.plos.org/s/diabetes-prevention-special-issue-guest-editors) on the PLOS Medicine special issue on [Diabetes Prevention](http://collections.plos.org/diabetes-prevention). I also wrote the editorial entitled [The Clinical and Public Health Challenges of Diabetes Prevention: A Search for Sustainable Solutions]( http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002097)  in which we discuss how diabetes is driven by rapid economic development and how attempts to deal with a public health problem by clinical approaches to prevention will be unaffordable and unsustainable in many countries. We focus on the need to develop effective and sustainable public health interventions for the prevention of type 2 diabetes that can be implemented in both resource-rich and resource-poor health care systems.

I am joined by Fumiaki Imamura and Jenna Panter, two scientists at the [MRC Epidemiology Unit](http://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, who also contributed research to the [Diabetes Prevention](http://collections.plos.org/diabetes-prevention) issue of PLOS Medicine.

Jenna is a Senior Research Associate in the MRC Epidemiology Unit. Her research focuses on examining patterns and determinants of change in physical activity and evaluating environmental and policy interventions to promote activity. Jenna recently published an article titled [Cycling and Diabetes Prevention: Practice-Based Evidence for Public Health Action](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002077) in [PLOS Medicine](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/) in which the authors discuss the findings from a linked paper by [Rasmussen and colleagues](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1002076%20) on changes in cycling and risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In the article, the authors highlight the need to conduct rigorous evaluations of interventions to promote physical activity which will provide evidence about how researchers can create a genuinely population-based public health strategy for the prevention of diabetes and other chronic diseases.

Fumiaki is a Senior Investigator Scientist at the MRC Epidemiology Unit. His research focuses on effects of dietary components and behaviours with a risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Fumiaki recently published a study titled [Effects of Saturated Fat, Polyunsaturated Fat, Monounsaturated Fat, and Carbohydrate on Glucose-Insulin Homeostasis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomised Controlled Feeding Trials](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002087) in PLOS Medicine. I am also a co-author of a study published by the EPIC-InterAct Study in the PLOS Medicine, [Association of Plasma Phospholipid n-3 and n-6 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Type 2 Diabetes: The EPIC-InterAct Case-Cohort Study](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002094). In the two studies based on published trials and the Europe-wide observational investigation, respectively, Fumiaki and colleagues indicate that fat commonly present in vegetable oils is good to reduce the burden of type 2 diabetes in many countries.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


We are Jessie Abbate, Carmen Lia Murall, and Christian Althaus, infectious disease researchers collaborating between France (Research Institute for Development), Switzerland (University of Bern), and Germany (Max Planck Institute). Collectively, our work focuses on the epidemiology, ecology, and evolution of pathogens, including human viral infections.


We recently published a study entitled [Potential Impact of Sexual Transmission on Ebola Virus Epidemiology: Sierra Leone as a Case Study](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004676) in [PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/).


Recent observations show that Ebola virus can remain active and transmissible in sperm for up to 9 months, meaning patients can remain infectious after they recover from the initial symptomatic phase of the disease. We developed a mathematical model to study the potential impact of sexual transmission on the size and duration of Ebola outbreaks such as the 2013-2016 epidemic in West Africa.


Using the epidemiological data from Sierra Leone as an example, we found that despite very few additional cases, sexual transmission from survivors could extend the duration of the epidemic substantially, allowing cases to continue popping up throughout 2016 and highlighting the need for care providers to stay alert for this possibility.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Jorge Ahumada and I am the executive director of the [TEAM Network](http://teamnetwork.org) at [Conservation International](http://www.conservation.org). I completed my PhD in [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.princeton.edu/eeb/) at Princeton University, where I studied the reproductive strategies of neotropical wrens. I am interested in applying mathematical models to solve applied conservation problems, and Ive worked on the impacts of climate change on disease and biodiversity, incorporating the effects of temperature and rainfall on models of disease-transmitting vectors and more recently on the use of camera traps for monitoring vertebrates.

My name is Lydia Beaudrot and I am a Michigan Fellow and Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan in the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/). I previously worked in the Moore Center for Science at [Conservation International](http://www.conservation.org/projects/Pages/Betty-and-Gordon-Moore-Center-for-Science-and-Oceans.aspx). My research focuses on how people and the environment affect mammals and birds in tropical forests.

We recently published a study with several colleagues in [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology) titled [Standardized Assessment of Biodiversity Trends in Tropical Forest Protected Areas: The End Is Not in Sight]( http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002357). Protected areas, such as National Parks, are very important for conservation, but surprisingly we have not known whether protected areas keep wildlife populations from declining. Our study used infrared-activated cameras placed in 15 tropical forests around the world by the TEAM Network and found that these protected areas have not had widespread wildlife declines recently, which is better news than previous studies have suggested.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Courtney Lane-Donovan, and I am an MD/PhD student in Neuroscience at the [University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center](http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/) in Dallas, Texas. Im interested in the underlying biology of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimers disease) and finding new molecular mechanisms that could be targeted for future drug development.

My name is [Joachim Herz](http://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/13165/joachim-herz.html), I am a Professor of Molecular Genetics and Neuroscience with a specific interest in lipid metabolism and the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and therapeutic approaches that Courtney has mentioned.  My claim to fame is that I was Courtneys MD/PhD mentor.  In the meantime, our roles seem to have reversed, as I have the feeling that I am the one who is learning more from Courtney each day.

We recently published a paper titled [High-Fat Diet Changes Hippocampal Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in a Genotype- and Carbohydrate-Dependent Manner in Mice](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0148099) in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/).

Alzheimers disease affects 1 in 8 individuals over the age of 65. The risk of developing Alzheimers disease is increased by lifestyle factors, including a high-fat Western diet and high cholesterol, as well as genetic risk factors. Our research is centered on one of the most common genetic risk factors: apolipoprotein (ApoE). Individuals who have the e4 isoform of ApoE (ApoE4, about 15% of the population) have a three-fold increased risk of developing Alzheimers. ApoE has many roles in the brain, including cholesterol transport and neuronal function.

In this study, we looked at the effect of a known lifestyle effect  high-fat diet  on levels of ApoE in the brain in mice expressing the different ApoE isoforms. We found that while the diet reduced levels of brain ApoE in mice expressing ApoE3, it did not affect the levels in mice expressing ApoE4 or mouse ApoE.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

Our names are Roslyn Dakin and Suzanne Amador Kane. We study animal behavior and vision.

Roz is a postdoctoral fellow in zoology at the University of British Columbia. She studies bird courtship, mating behavior, and flight. Suzanne is a biological physics professor at Haverford College. Her research focuses on how physics influences animal behavior.

Along with coauthors Owen McCrossan, Jim Hare, and Bob Montgomerie, we recently published a study in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone) titled, ["Biomechanics of the Peacock's Display: How Feather Structure and Resonance Influence Multimodal Signaling"](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152759).

When peacocks try to impress females, they fan their feathers and vibrate them at a very high rate, causing the eyespots to hover against an undulating, shimmering background. We explored the physics of this display. We found that the individual feathers move as standing waves. Furthermore, the peacocks tail as a whole has a resonant peak frequency matching the vibration frequency of the display (about 25 times per second). This indicates that the tail is well-suited to perform the display efficiently. However, when we studied individual peacocks in the field, we found that individuals with longer feathers used slightly higher frequencies on average, suggesting that the display may reveal a males capacity to generate muscular force. Its still an open question as to how (or if) this display influences the female, her perception of the peacock's iridescent colors, and how she chooses a mate.

We are excited to answer your questions at 1pm ET. Ask Us Anything!

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


My name is [Professor Damien Keating](https://www.flinders.edu.au/neuroscience/lab_molecular.html) and I am a cell physiologist at Flinders University in the School of Medicine. My research focuses on understanding how cells release chemical signals to each other and how this relates to certain diseases such as diabetes.


I recently published a paper titled [A Syntenic Cross Species Aneuploidy Genetic Screen Links RCAN1 Expression to -Cell Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetes]( http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006033) in [PLOS Genetics]( http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/).



In this study we wanted to identify what might drive pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and reduced plasma insulin in type 2 diabetes (T2D). If those beta cell changes dont happen people dont develop T2D. We tackled this in a different way by looking at diabetes in Down syndrome (where chromosome 21 is triplicated), as beta cells in individuals with Down syndrome show the same defects observed in T2D beta cells. Using a screening approach combining Down syndrome mouse models and human T2D beta cells, we arrived at a single lead candidate, RCAN1. We then provided functional evidence that increased RCAN1 expression causes defects in beta cell mitochondrial function and insulin release that are observed in T2D beta cells. We hope this will provide a platform to examine whether affecting RCAN1 function or expression could have positive influences in T2D.



I look forward to chatting with you all on this topic from Australia. I will be answering your questions at 1pm ET -- Ask Me Anything!

<TITLE> PLOS Science Wednesday: Hi reddit, were Mahdad, Lucy and Gabriele. We found several different effects of HIV-1 infection on anti-TB immune response, presenting new implications for treating patients with TB and HIV infections  Ask Us Anything! </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Dr Mahdad Noursadeghi. I lead a research group in Infection   Immunity at [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/), in which we try to discriminate between human immune responses to microbial infection that protect us from those that cause disease. We focus our efforts on tuberculosis (TB), HIV and the role of macrophages.

And my name is Dr Lucy Bell. Im a researcher in Infection   Immunity at [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/). My research explores the impact of HIV-1 infection on immune responses to other infections, such as TB, using methods ranging from in vitro macrophage co-infection experiments to human experimental challenge models.

And my name is Dr Gabriele Pollara. I'm a postdoctoral clinical research fellow at [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/). My work focuses on understanding the nature of protective immune responses to TB infection. My main methodological interests are the use of transcriptional modules to deconvolute biological information from whole genome transcriptional datasets.

We recently published a paper titled [In Vivo Molecular Dissection of the Effects of HIV-1 in Active Tuberculosis](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1005469) in [PLOS Pathogens]( http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens). We aimed to investigate whether HIV-1 infection changed the anti-TB immune response in vivo in patients with active TB, by using the tuberculin skin test (the TST, also known as the Mantoux test) as a challenge model. By analysing biopsy samples taken from the site of TSTs, we found several effects of HIV-1. In early HIV-1 infection, we found diminishment of an immune response component that usually helps prevent harmful inflammation. In more advanced HIV-1, we found almost complete absence of any anti-TB immune response, except for activity which is normally part of our defence against viruses. In a third group of patients, in whom active TB only became apparent after starting treatment for HIV-1, we found that most immune responses had recovered to normal levels, but that one particular response sometimes associated with asthma and allergies was exaggerated.

Our results provide new insights which may help explain why HIV-1 positive patients have a substantially increased risk of active TB, and which may inform the development of new treatments for HIV-1/TB co-infection.

We will be answering your questions about our research, TB and HIV at 1pm ET. Ask us Anything!

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Emily Bucholz. I am a pediatric resident at [Boston Childrens Hospital](http://www.childrenshospital.org/) but did my doctorate at [Yale School of Medicine](http://medicine.yale.edu/). My doctoral research focuses on sociodemographic and clinical predictors of life expectancy after heart attacks. I am particularly interested in how risk factors for the development of coronary heart disease affect long-term survival after heart attacks.

I am the lead author of a study recently published in PLOS Medicine titled [Underweight, Markers of Cachexia, and Mortality in Acute Myocardial Infarction: a Prospective Cohort Study of Elderly Medicare Beneficiaries](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001998). In this study, we studied over 50,000 Medicare beneficiaries to examine the effect of underweight on survival after heart attack. We used two techniques (adjustment and stratification) to disentangle the effects of low weight from comorbidity and frailty, which can also lead to weight loss and poor health outcomes. We found that being underweight was an independent risk factor for higher short- and long-term mortality after heart attack. There are several potential explanations for these findings including decreased physiologic reserve, lower rates of guideline-based therapies, and genetic predisposition. Regardless of the mechanism, we conclude that strategies to promote weight gain after heart attack -- both in the hospital and after discharge --are worthy of testing.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,



My name is [Nicholas Money](http://miamioh.edu/cas/academics/departments/biology/about/faculty/money/index.html). Im a biologist at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio and specialize in the study of fungal growth and reproduction. I am fascinated by the extraordinary mechanisms of spore discharge in these organisms that include high-velocity spurts, exploding gas bubbles, and a catapult that launches mushroom spores.




I am the senior author of a 2015 paper in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone) titled, [Mushrooms as rainmakers: How spores act as nuclei for raindrops](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140407). A couple of years ago I was struck by research by atmospheric chemists that suggested that 50 million tons of fungal spores are ejected into the atmosphere every year. This made me wonder whether the mechanism of drop expansion that powers the discharge of mushroom spores could be reactivated once the spores were airborne. If this happened in clouds, it could play a significant role in the condensation of water and stimulate rainfall. The PLOS ONE paper reports experiments that offer a proof of concept using environmental scanning electron microscopy. This work was co-authored by my doctoral student, Maribeth Hassett, and long-term collaborator Mark Fischer, a physicist at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit!

Im [Nick Warren Ruktanonchai](http://www.flowminder.org/people/nick-ruktanonchai), a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Southampton. Im interested in understanding how people move, which helps us predict when, where, and why some people become exposed to areas with infectious diseases. And I am [Cori Warren Ruktanonchai](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/geography/about/staff/cr2m14.page), a PhD student in Geography   Environment at the University of Southampton--as you may have noticed by the names, I also happen to be Nicks wife! Im interested in using spatial statistics to better locate pregnant women, mothers and newborns at risk of adverse health outcomes.

We recently published an article titled [Identifying Malaria Transmission Foci for Elimination Using Human Mobility Data](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004846) in [PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/), mapping where people got malaria based on their travel patterns.

We combined data from 1.19 million mobile phones in Namibia with a map of malaria prevalence to predict areas where the most people get infected. We hope that by targeting these hotspots, elimination efforts can both send help where it's most needed and reduce transmission nationwide.

Call and text locations from mobile phones are a great tool for knowing where people have been. At [Flowminder](http://www.flowminder.org), weve used mobile phone data to not only help governments and NGOs predict the spread of disease, weve also used it to understand how people move after catastrophes, including a [PLOS Medicine paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001083) on the 2010 Haiti earthquake and a [PLOS Currents paper](http://currents.plos.org/disasters/article/rapid-and-near-real-time-assessments-of-population-displacement-using-mobile-phone-data-following-disasters-the-2015-nepal-earthquake/) on the 2015 Nepal earthquake.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Florian Markowetz and I am a cancer researcher at the University of Cambridge in the [Cancer Research UK (CRUK)](http://www.cambridgecancer.org.uk/) Cambridge Institute. My lab and I try to understand how genetic variability between and within patients leads to differences in cancer progression and outcome.

And my name is James Brenton and I am a senior group leader at the CRUK Cambridge Institute, where I study the functional genomics of ovarian cancer and lead on translational studies in the clinic as a medical oncologist at Cambridge University Hospitals.

We recently published a paper titled [Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in high-grade serous ovarian cancer: a phylogenetic reconstruction](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001789) in [PLOS Medicine](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine). The main hypothesis that we were trying to test was whether the magnitude of intratumoural heterogeneity in a patients ovarian cancer was a predictor of their outcome. For this, we developed new methods to parsimoniously reconstruct phylogenies using copy number profiles. We found evidence that resistance to treatment could be linked to the degree of genetic heterogeneity in the tumor. The more heterogeneous a tumor is, the more likely is it that the patient becomes resistant. Our study is small, but it identified what could be one of the key reasons why drugs stop being effective after some time.

We are looking forward to exploring this topic further with you and will be answering your questions at 1pm ET -- Ask Us Anything!

My name is [Ben Lopman](http://blogs.cdc.gov/safehealthcare/authors/ben-lopman-ph-d/) and I am an infectious disease epidemiologist with Division of Viral Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). My research focuses on the epidemiology of diarrheal disease and, specifically, its viral causes.

I am a lead author on recently published PLOS Collection titled [The Global Burden of Norovirus   Prospects for Vaccine Development"](http://collections.plos.org/norovirus). This collection explains why a norovirus vaccine is so important and focuses on some basic science and public health questions that need to be addressed in order to pave the way for a vaccine.

Noroviruses are estimated to cause over 200,000 deaths every year globally. And, all added up, they cost over $60 billion worldwide each year due to health and societal impacts. Noroviruses can cause severe disease among children, the elderly and other vulnerable populations, such as patients in hospitals or residents in nursing homes, places where outbreaks often occur. Better control strategies, including vaccines, are needed, and, thankfully, are under development.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Reddit!
 
My name is Neelesh Patankar, and I am the Charles Deering McCormick Professor of Teaching Excellence and Associate Chair of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University. Following my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at University of Pennsylvania, I was a post-doctoral associate with Prof. Daniel D. Joseph at the University of Minnesota until 2000. I then joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University as an Assistant Professor in 2000, and have been a Professor since 2011. My research area is developing computational methods for immersed bodies in fluids, applying computations to problems in biology (fish swimming, esophageal transport, rat whiskers), and designing textured surfaces for non-wetting, super-wetting, or anti-icing properties.
 
And my name is Malcolm MacIver, and I am a Professor with a joint appointment in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Department of Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern University. I completed my Ph.D. in neuroscience at the Beckman Institute of Advanced Sciences and Technology at the University of Illinois, and my post-doc in mechanical engineering at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, joining Northwestern in 2003. My research includes the mechanical and neural basis of animal behavior, particularly the intersection of information harvesting and biomechanics, utilizing a variety of approaches spanning behavioral analysis, computer simulations, robotics, neurobiology, and mechanics.
 
We recently published a [paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002123) in [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology) examining how diverse groups of aquatic animals, including vertebrates and invertebrates, evolved independently to exhibit a mechanically optimal method of swimming. Using computational modeling, measurements, and a robotic fish, we demonstrate that this best way to swim maximizes propulsive force and speed. There is some small amount of variability around the optimum in the many species we measured, but that variability is always within a relatively small zone where the decrease in performance is less significant. Our result touches on a long standing debate within biology about whether evolution is largely about chance, or about necessity. If we were to rewind the clock and restart evolution, would we get the same animals, or different ones? For example, birds evolved wings, and so did insects, but their last common ancestor did not have wings. This suggests that an aerial animalon any planet with earth-like atmospheremight have wings. The idea that evolution is therefore more about necessity than chance due to these kinds of repeated patterns is referred to as convergent evolution. One of the unique contributions of our work is that we can quantitatively show where the optimum exists, while it has proven difficult to do so for other examples of convergent evolution.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit, my name is Dr. Nina Kraus and I am professor and neuroscientist at [Northwestern University](https://www.communication.northwestern.edu/faculty/NinaKraus). My research focuses on how the brain learns to make sense of sound, and the impact of this learning on our ability to communicate with one another.

I recently published a study titled ["Auditory processing in noise: A preschooler biomarker for literacy"](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002196) in [PLOS Biology]( http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology). In this study, we measured how a preschoolers brain responds to sound, using an objective biological approach my lab has developed. We found that the integrity with which preschoolers' brains processed consonants in noise paralleled their early language development, and could predict the development of their literacy skills one year out. This suggests we have an approach to identify which preschoolers will struggle learning to read long before they begin formal instruction. This is important because it would allow us to provide interventions for language disorders such as dyslexia to children before they experience prolonged challenges in school.

We recently published a study titled [Hyperthermic Laser Ablation of Recurrent Glioblastoma Leads to Temporary Disruption of the Peritumoral Blood Brain Barrier](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0148613) in [PLOS ONE]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone). We found that a laser system commonly used to kill brain tumors has an additional and significant benefit: It creates a temporary opening in the blood-brain barrier  a natural barrier thats normally efficient at blocking out chemicals and bacteria  to allow the passage of chemotherapy and immunotherapy drugs into the brain, for up to six weeks. This discovery could lead to new treatment protocols for glioblastoma, a very aggressive brain cancer thats highly resistant to standard treatment.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Lisa Jones-Engel and I am a Senior Research Scientist at the [University of Washington](http://staff.washington.edu/ljengel/teammonkey/lisa.htm). For nearly two decades my research team has focused on the infectious agents that are transmitted at the increasingly porous human-primate interface in Asia.

And my name is Stacey Schultz-Cherry and I am a Full Member (Professor) at [St Jude Childrens Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/directory/s/stacey-schultz-cherry.html) where my research focuses on the pathogenesis of influenza virus and enteric viruses, like Astroviruses, especially in high-risk populations. 

My name is Erik Karlsson and I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [St Jude Childrens Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/) where my research focuses on host factors, especially nutrition, that affect the pathogenesis and evolution of influenza virus and enteric viruses.

My name is Christopher Small and I am the Head Data Scientist at [pol.is](https://pol.is/home) a startup applying data visualization and machine learning to making sense of large scale conversations. I also do distributed systems and web app development consulting as ThoughtNode Software. Before all that, I worked with Erick Matsen at [Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html), studying metagenomics and molecular viral epidemiology. 

Astroviruses are leading causes of diarrhea in children under the age of 2, immune-compromised populations and the elderly. You can get them from infected people but also through contaminated food and water. They also appear to be causing encephalitis in high-risk populations. Although we knew that Astroviruses were found in lots of different birds and animals, we never thought human viruses could infect animals or vice versa. We thought infections were species-specific (i.e. only human viruses could infect humans). That changed in 2009 when we began finding viruses in humans that were genetically more similar to animal viruses.

Thats where our recent publication titled [Non-Human Primates Harbor Diverse Mammalian and Avian Astroviruses Including Those Associated with Human Infections](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005225) in [PLOS Pathogens](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/) provided important new data. For the study, we sampled 879 urban, temple, captive and wild primates in Bangladesh and Cambodia. We found that 8% of primates were infected with diverse mammalian and avian Astroviruses, including those previously only known to infect humans. Clearly this exemplifies One Health and how infectious diseases of humans can impact animals we contact and potentially vice versa.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

We are Gavin Yamey, Carlos Morel, Peter Hotez, Margaret Kruk, and Soumya Swaminathan, global health researchers who co-authored the [PLOS Grand Convergence Collection](http://collections.plos.org/grand-convergence). In the Collection, we show how strategic investments in research and development, as well as aggressive scale-up of health-care delivery systems to implement existing health tools and services, can lead to a dramatic reduction in the global burden of disease by 2035. The collection focuses on five conditions that disproportionately affect the worlds poorest people: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, maternal and child mortality, and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Our introductions are included below.

My name is [Gavin Yamey](http://globalhealth.duke.edu/) and I am a Professor of the Practice of Global Health and Public Policy at Duke University. My research focuses on large scale questions in global health, such as the best ways to finance and deliver global health interventions. And my name is [Carlos Morel](http://www.dndi.org/about-dndi/friends-of-dndi/carlos-medicis-morel/) and I am the Director of the Center for Technological Development in Health (CDTS in its Portuguese acronym) at the [Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz)](http://portal.fiocruz.br/en/content/home-ingl%C3%AAs), an institution with headquarters in Rio de Janeiro affiliated to the Brazilian Ministry of Health. My research focuses on the role of translational sciences in developing new tools for the prevention, control and treatment of NTDs.

We recently coordinated a special collection of nine papers across three PLOS journals [PLOS Biology]( http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/), [PLOS Medicine](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/), [PLOS Neglected Diseases](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/) called [Grand Convergence: Aligning Technologies   Realities in Global Health](http://collections.plos.org/grand-convergence). Grand convergence means reducing infectious, maternal, and child deaths down to universally low levels. [The Lancet Commission on Investing in Health](http://www.GlobalHealth2035.org) showed that grand convergence could be achieved by 2035 provided that new health technologies are discovered and delivered to those who most need them. Additional Collection authors and AMA participants are introduced below.

My name is [Margaret Kruk](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/margaret-kruk/) and I am an Associate Professor of Global Health at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/). My research focuses on the quality and responsiveness of health systems in low and middle income countries. My contribution to the Collection was a [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology) paper titled [Transforming Global Health by Improving the Science of Scale Up](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002360). In the paper, we advocate for increased policy and implementation research in order to produce generalizable evidence on what works to implement successful health interventions at scale. We also propose a priority research agenda to support the goal of reducing infectious, child and maternal mortality rates and supporting universal health coverage in low and middle income countries.

My name is Peter Hotez and I am Dean of the [National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/education/schools/national-school-of-tropical-medicine) and founding editor-in-chief of [PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/). My contribution to the Collection was a [PLOS NTDs ](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/) paper titled [Eliminating the Neglected Tropical Diseases: Translational Science and New Technologies](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003895), where we summarize some of the key challenges in translational science to develop and implement new technologies to successfully eliminate NTDs globally.

My name is Soumya Swaminathan and I am Secretary of the Department of Health Research for the [Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India](http://www.mohfw.nic.in/), and Director General of the [Indian Council of Medical Research](http://www.icmr.nic.in/). My research focuses on pediatric and adult tuberculosis, epidemiology and pathogenesis, the role of nutrition, and HIV-associated TB. My contribution to the Collection was a [PLOS Medicine](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine) paper entitled [Translational Research for Tuberculosis Elimination: Priorities, Challenges, and Actions](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001965).  We argue that achieving the WHO End TB Strategy will only be possible through the development and rapid uptake of new tools, including rapid point-of-care diagnostics, safe and shorter treatment of latent TB infection and disease, and an efficacious TB vaccine, combined with efficient health systems and care provision, and actions on the social determinants of TB. We advocate for enhancing research along the full spectrum, from basic to implementation, and strengthening research capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries severely affected by the TB epidemics, is crucial for TB elimination.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

We are Michael Emerman and Lucie Etienne. [Michael](http://research.fhcrc.org/emerman/en.html) is a Full Member at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) in Seattle, WA, and [Lucie](https://lsetienne.wordpress.com/) is an Assistant Professor at the [International Center of Infectiology Research](http://ciri.inserm.fr/en/) in Lyon, France. Our research focuses on the evolutionary battle between viruses and their hosts with an emphasis on viruses such as HIV.  We study how viruses evolve to infect new hosts by neutralizing some of the host defense proteins.

We recently published a paper in [PLOS Pathogens](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens) entitled [The Role of the Antiviral APOBEC3 Gene Family in Protecting Chimpanzees against Lentiviruses from Monkeys](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005149). In this study, we wondered why chimpanzees are not infected by more viruses like HIV since they eat many monkeys that harbor similar viruses, called SIVs. We found that a protein in the chimpanzee called APOBEC3G may protect them from infection because the SIVs from monkeys are not capable of overcoming its antiviral effects. The actions of APOBEC3G and its interactions with the viral proteins also help understand better the ancient origins of HIV.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


My name is [Wan Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/wanyangblog/), and I am an Associate Research Scientist at Columbia Universitys [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/). I use mathematical and statistical methods to study how infectious diseases (e.g. influenza and Ebola) spread through populations and develop methods to predict them.


My colleagues and I published a paper, ["Forecasting Influenza Epidemics in Hong Kong"](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004383) in the journal [PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/). Hong Kong has a humid subtropical climate and is a known global epicenter for flu. Unlike the U.S., where flu is seasonal, the timing of flu outbreaks in Hong Kong and similar climates is highly irregularmaking prediction particularly challenging. Using data from 1998 to 2013, we developed two forecast systems for Hong Kong. We were able to predict the timing and magnitude of flu epidemics and the 2009 pandemic with accuracy near that achieved for the U.S.http://cpid.iri.columbia.edu/ Our findings suggest that forecast of irregular infectious disease epidemics (e.g. the flu epidemics in Hong Kong) is possible.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Pedro Afonso, and I am a senior researcher at the [Institute of Marine Research]( http://www.horta.uac.pt/intradop/index.php/contactos-topmenu2-180/65-utilidades/personal-pages/1406-pedro-afonso) and MARE - Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre, both based at the [University of the Azores](http://www.horta.uac.pt/). I recently published a paper in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone) entitled [Dynamics of Whale Shark Occurrence at Their Fringe Oceanic Habitat](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102060), where we investigated the patterns of occurrence of whale sharks over the mid north Atlantic ridge. Using 16 years of observational data from a pole-and-line fishery across the Azores and GAM models, we investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of whale shark occurrence in relation to oceanographic features. Our study found that whale shark sightings in this oceanic region increased sharply in 2008, and that sea surface temperature helps predict whale shark occurrence in the region. Our research also showed that the Azores are at a thermal boundary for whale sharks, which can help explain the post-2007 increase in sightings and has further implications in the face of climate change.

<TEXT> My name is Albert Ko and I am a professor at [Yale School of Public Health](https://publichealth.yale.edu/people/albert_ko.profile) and a collaborating researcher at [Fundao Oswaldo Cruz, Brazilian Ministry of Health](http://portal.fiocruz.br/en/content/home-ingl%C3%AAs). My research focuses on identifying solutions for health problems that have emerged as a consequence of rapid urbanization, social inequity and the growth of slum settlements and I am part of a team that has been investigating the outbreak of microcephaly in the city of Salvador, Brazil. Today I am joined by Dr. Manoel Sarno, the lead investigator on the study and doctor at the State Department of Health in Bahia, Salvador in Brazil; and our colleague Dr. Hugo Ribeiro, associate professor of Pediatrics at [Federal University of Bahia School of Medicine](https://www.ufba.br/), chief of the Fima Lifshitz Research Center at the University Hospital at Federal University of Bahia and also the executive director of Roberto Santos General Hospital, in Salvador, Bahia in Brazil.


We recently published a study, entitled [Zika Virus Infection and Stillbirths: A Case of Hydrops Fetalis, Hydranencephaly and Fetal Demise](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004517), in [PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds). This study, conducted in Brazil, detected Zika virus in a stillborn fetus that had developed hydrops fetalis, a condition characterized by abnormal accumulation of fluid, and severe central nervous system defects including microcephaly. The case provides supportive evidence for a potential link between Zika virus and brain defects.  In addition, the findings suggest that the virus may affect other tissues and may lead to fetal demise. Given the recent spread of the virus in the Americas, systematic investigation of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths may be warranted to evaluate the risk that Zika virus infection imparts on these outcomes.


This study and more Zika research can be found in the [PLOS Zika Collection](http://collections.plos.org/zika).

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Alexander Suh and I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Uppsala University](http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N12-1893_1) in Sweden. My research focuses on the evolution of birds and their genomic parasites, such as transposons and viruses.

We recently published a study in [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology) titled [The dynamics of incomplete lineage sorting across the ancient adaptive radiation of neoavian birds](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002224). There we analyzed the evolutionary signature of what some call the big bang of modern birds, a rapid succession of speciation events following the extinction of dinosaurs.

We used ancient retrotransposon insertions from 48 bird genomes to reconstruct evolutionary relationships, showing that most of the bird Tree of Life can be reliably resolved by our study and previous studies. However, we were surprised to find that the very onset of the big bang of modern birds harbors extreme degrees of conflict. In fact, the conflicts are so complex that they look more like a network than a tree. Our explanation for this complexity is that bird speciation in the direct aftermath of dinosaur extinction was extremely rapid, potentially too rapid to be resolvable as a single tree.

I will be answering your questions at 1 pm EST (10am PST, 7 pm CET). Ask Me About Birds, Transposons, Anything!

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Dr. Sanjay Basu, a physician and epidemiologist at [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/sanjay-basu) working on the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease worldwide. I recently published two articles in [PLOS Medicine](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine) that focus on diabetes prevention. In ["The Health System and Population Health Implications of Large-Scale Diabetes Screening in India:  A Microsimulation Model of Alternative Approaches"](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001827) we found that large-scale community-based screenings in India are likely to produce a large number of false-positive results, particularly if using the currently available screening instruments. In [Averting Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes in India through Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Taxation: An Economic-Epidemiologic Modeling Study](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001582) we developed an economic-epidemiologic model that found introducing sustained taxation on sugar sweetened beverages could mitigate the increasing rate of obesity and type 2 diabetes in India. We found that given current consumption patterns, the relative effect of SSB taxes would be expected among both urban and rural populations in India. This is important in light of the increasing global prevalence of type 2 diabetes; the WHO estimates that in 2014 the global prevalence of diabetes (of all types) was already 9% among adults aged 18+ years.

In recognition that a focus on prevention is critical to addressing climbing diabetes rates globally, [PLOS Medicine](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine) has called for papers on diabetes prevention for a special issue. Publishing research on diabetes prevention is a top priority for PLOS Medicine, but to be considered for this special issue, all submissions are due on March 4 2016. To learn more about submitting your research, [read the Speaking of Medicine post](http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/01/19/the-future-of-diabetes-prevention-a-call-for-papers/).

My name is Dr. Sarah E. (Moffitt) Myhre and I am postdoctoral scholar at the [University of Washington](http://ice.washington.edu/). My research focuses on understanding the consequences of abrupt climate warming to marine ecosystems. And my name is Kate Davis and I am graduate researcher at the [University of California, Davis](http://geology.ucdavis.edu/index.php). My research focuses on the use of microfossils in reconstructing past marine environments.

We recently published a paper titled [Paleoceanographic Insights on Recent Oxygen Minimum Zone Expansion: Lessons for Modern Oceanography](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115246) in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone). Oxygen Minimum Zones are natural features in many ocean basins, where they have profound effects for marine life, which are currently expanding in response to changes in global climate. In this study, we looked at records of Oxygen Minimum Zone change during the last period of rapid climate change  the last deglaciation.

Were here to talk about how oceans lose oxygen during events of global-scale climate warming and why this is really important to marine life. Past events of climate warming reveal that capacity of ocean systems to dramatically reorganize to states that have never existed in human history. Please ask us questions about climate change, oceanography and marine ecology!

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Dr. Claudia Denkinger and I am a lecturer at [Harvard Medical School](http://hms.harvard.edu/) and the Head of the [Tuberculosis and Hepatitis Programme at FIND](http://www.finddiagnostics.org/about/who_we_are/team/denkinger.html). FIND is a non-for-profit organization in Geneva that is working to provide diagnostic solutions for patients in resource poor settings.

And my name is Dr. David Dowdy and I am an Associate Professor of Epidemiology at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/5157/david-dowdy). My research focuses on the population-level dynamics of tuberculosis - including drug-resistant tuberculosis - in high-burden settings.

We recently published a paper entitled, ["Do we need to detect isoniazid resistance in addition to rifampicin resistance in diagnostic tests for tuberculosis?"](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0084197) in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/). In this paper, we constructed a mathematical model of tuberculosis transmission in a population similar to that of India, in order to evaluate the effects of different strategies for drug resistance testing on the future of the drug-resistant TB epidemic. We specifically looked at testing for rifampicin and isoniazid - the two most important first-line TB drugs - and we found that testing for isoniazid did not provide much additional benefit on top of testing for rifampicin. These results have been important for developing policy related to resistance testing for TB, as well as our understanding of long-term dynamics of resistance to different drugs against TB.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

Our names are Ru Daros, Joo Costa, Marina von Keyserlingk, Maria Htzel, Heather Neave and Daniel Weary. We are researchers from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in Canada and the [Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](http://en.ufsc.br/) in Brazil. Our research focuses on animal welfare, how to use changes in behaviour to make inferences about the quality of life that animals experience.

We recently published a study entitled ["Separation from the Dam Causes Negative Judgement Bias in Dairy Calves](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098429) in [PLOS ONE]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/).

Young farm animals, including dairy calves, are often separated from the dam far earlier than what occurs under natural conditions. Farms animals are also sometimes subjected to painful procedures like hot-iron dehorning. The aim of this study was to better understand the effects of these routine procedures on the emotions of animals. One way to investigate mood states is to look for evidence of judgement biases. We tested for cognitive biases in calves before and after separation from the cow and dehorning, and found diminished responding to intermediate, ambiguous stimuli (evidence of a pessimistic response) following both physical pain and social loss. This paper illustrates one approach to investigating emotional states in animals, and draws parallels in the emotional experience of physical and social pain.

We will be online at 1pm EST (10am PST), and we look forward to hearing your questions about our work!

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Nicholas Heintz and I am a Professor of Pathology at the [University of Vermont Cancer Center](http://www.uvm.edu/medicine/vtcancercenter/). My research has focused on dysregulation of redox signaling in cancer cells, and how the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor cell mitochondria can be exploited for therapeutic purposes in aggressive human malignancies like mesothelioma. My coauthors Brian Cunniff (a former graduate student in my lab), and Kim Nelson (a postdoctoral fellow at Wake Forest) are joining me for this AMA.

My name is Brian Cunniff and I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/). My research focuses on intracellular trafficking, specifically clathrin mediated endocytosis, during cell migration and tissue organization. Using cutting-edge lattice light sheet microscopy we are able to visualize cellular processes with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.

My name is Kim Nelson and I am junior faculty in the Chemistry Department at [Wake Forest University](http://college.wfu.edu/chemistry/). I have been part of a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary team of researchers at Wake Forest who are focused on elucidating how reactive oxygen species are produced in a regulated manner as part of cell signaling events involved in growth, cell division, and cell death. My research has focused on 1) the kinetic, biophysical, and structural analysis of features in the peroxiredoxin family of proteins that modulate their rapid reaction with peroxide and 2) the identification, visualization, and biochemical analysis of proteins that are functionally modified by cysteine oxidation in response to regulated, intracellular hydrogen peroxide production. Along with Todd Lowther, my contribution to this study was in utilizing structural, kinetics and mass spectrometry analyses to characterize the mechanism by which thiostrepton directly associated with and inhibited the activity of purified human Peroxiredoxin 3.

We recently published a research study titled [Disabling mitochondrial peroxide metabolism via combinatorial targeting of peroxiredoxin 3 as an effective therapeutic approach for malignant mesothelioma](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127310) in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone). In this paper we show that the thiazole antibiotic thiostrepton covalently crosslinks the antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin 3, thereby inactivating its activity. Since peroxiredoxin 3 is largely responsible for metabolizing the copious amounts of ROS produced by mitochondria in human mesothelioma cells, inactivation induces intolerable levels of mitochondrial oxidative stress and tumor cell death. When paired with gentian violet, which blocks expression of another antioxidant enzyme in the peroxiredoxin 3 pathway, thiostrepton markedly inhibits tumor growth in mouse models of human mesothelioma.

This work extends our previous observations published in PLOS ONE, [Peroxiredoxin 3 is a redox-dependent target of thiostrepton in malignant mesothelioma cells](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039404); which showed that the activity of thiostrepton is dependent on the redox state of the cell, thereby explaining the preferential effects of the drug on highly malignant tumor cells that commonly produce large amounts of ROS. Our paper, along with many other recent studies, identifies pro-oxidant therapeutic approaches as viable treatments for intractable tumors.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is [Malcolm Macleod](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/clinical-brain-sciences/people/principal-investigators/professor-malcolm-macleod) and I am Professor of Neurology and Translational Neuroscience at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/clinical-brain-sciences). Im interested in risks of bias in animal research, and how these might get in the way of the development of new drugs.

And my name is [David Howells](https://rmdb.research.utas.edu.au/public/rmdb/q/indiv_detail_warp_trans/12701) and I am Professor of Neuroscience and Brain Plasticity at the [University of Tasmania]( http://www.utas.edu.au/health/about-us/school-of-medicine). My research on stroke focuses on how we translate good ideas into solid bench science that might then survive the rigor of clinical trialing to provide treatments for brain diseases.

We recently published a study titled [Risks of bias in reports of in vivo research: A focus for improvement](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002273 ) in [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology).

This study extends work across multiple neuroscience domains which highlights the risk of overestimation of the potential for translational success when studies fail to take measures to reduce the impact of bias. This study investigated whether this held true across a broader range of science and whether where the work was conducted or published influenced the risk of bias.

We already know that publications which do not describe certain design features which reduce the risk of bias (e.g. randomization, blinding) tend to exaggerate observed effects, at least in the neurosciences. We were interested to see whether this was the case more generally, and if this was different in journals with a high impact factor or in work from leading institutions. We found that nobody is doing particularly well but also that work from leading institutions or published in high impact factor journals was at greater than average risk of bias. We hope that scientists, institutions, journals, and funders will use these findings to help improve the process of drug discovery and development.

We will be answering your questions at 1pm EST (10am PST and 5am on 1/14/16 in Melbourne). Ask Us Anything! You can follow Malcolm on Twitter [@maclomaclee](https://twitter.com/Maclomaclee), and [@CAMARADES_](https://twitter.com/CAMARADES_) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit! 

My name is Christine Kreuder Johnson, I am a Professor of Epidemiology at the University of California School of Veterinary Medicines [One Health Institute](http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/ohi/). Joining me today is Tierra Smiley Evans, a veterinarian and graduate student in epidemiology at UC Davis who developed the primate sampling technique published recently in [PLOS NTDs](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds),  [Optimization of a Novel Non-invasive Oral Sampling Technique for Zoonotic Pathogen Surveillance in Nonhuman Primates](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003813), that we will be discussing today.

CHRISTINE KREUDER JOHNSON  My research focuses on ecological processes that impact wildlife and public health. I am especially interested in finding new ways to investigate disease in endangered species and identifying One Health solutions for protecting human and animal health. Most recently, I work with a consortium of partners on USAIDs [Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT project](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/fact-sheets/emerging-pandemic-threats-program) to develop global surveillance capabilities to detect infectious disease threats with pandemic potential. We focus on zoonotic viruses that spillover from animals to cause disease in humans and we work at the highest-risk interfaces around the world where new diseases are most likely to emerge.  Our published study [Spillover and Pandemic Properties of Zoonotic Viruses with High Host Plasticity](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14830) highlights many of the epidemiologic circumstances promoting spillover, amplification, and spread of zoonotic viruses that we are investigating in order to direct interventions aimed at disease prevention.

TIERRA SMILEY EVANS  My research focuses on zoonotic disease transmission in human and non-human primate communities in Africa and Asia. I have conducted field research in Uganda, Rwanda, Nepal and Myanmar and I am particularly interested in developing non-invasive diagnostics for wildlife that can enable us to understand disease dynamics in these remote settings. Our recent [PLOS NTDS](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003813) article describes a non-invasive sampling technique that involves distributing a rope for primates to chew on that can be retrieved and screened for pathogens that are present in the mouth. This method provides an alternative approach to anesthetizing wild primates to test for diseases and enables sampling of populations that otherwise would not be able to be sampled. Our methods can be applied to studies examining primates as sources of diseases that could affect humans in remote tropical settings.

Our study and its implications for public health is also discussed in a [post on the PLOS Student Blog](http://blogs.plos.org/thestudentblog/2015/09/11/wildanimals/).

We are looking forward to answering your questions at 1pm ET today  Ask Us Anything! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Jack L. Conrad and I am an Assistant Professor at [NYIT College of Osteopathic Medicine](http://www.nyit.edu/medicine) and a Research Associate at the [American Museum of Natural History (AMNH)](http://www.amnh.org/). My research focuses on the evolution, morphology, and paleontology of modern and living snakes, amphisbaenians, mosasaurs, and other 'lizards' (Squamata). Squamates first appeared around 245 million years ago, have a good fossil record for the last 155 million years, and today include more than 9700 living species; that's alotta Squamata!

One of the most difficult problems in understanding squamate evolution is snake origins. We know that many branches of the lizard family tree lost their limbs -- there are limbess geckoes, limbless skinks, limbless cousins to the Komodo Dragon, etc. -- but we don't know from which branch of the lizard family tree snakes come. It's really become quite a headache, but also a fun area for investigation.

Studying this problem, and other areas of squamate evolution, leads scientists like myself to understanding other natural science questions and phenomena, including (but certainly not limited to): What was Earth like at various times in the past? Are there physical constraints on how big a lizard can be on land? In the seas? How did lizards move across the planet as they evolved over time?

I recently published a study titled ["A new Eocene casquehead lizard (Reptliia, Corytophanidae) from North America](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127900) in [PLOS ONE](http://www.plosone.org/). This study described the earliest known species of casquehead, or Jesus lizard, known. Importantly, this animal lived in Wyoming when the planet was much warmer than it is now and because its modern relatives live only in the tropics, it raises questions about what might happen if our planet warmed up a few degrees.

I will be answering your questions at 1pm ET. Ask Me Anything! I love everything about reptiles and evolution. I may not have all of your answers, but I will certainly enjoy talking with you about all of your questions!

<TEXT> Hi Reddit!

My name is Andy Reagan and I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Vermont](http://www.uvm.edu). My research focuses on computational social dynamics: using big data to better understand language, happiness, and health. I am joined by Bill Gottesman, a designer and builder of [sundials](http://www.precisionsundials.com), and Dr. Peter Dodds, Director of the Vermont Complex Systems Center and a Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the [University of Vermont (UVM)](http://www.uvm.edu). Dr.  Dodds teaches courses on the [principles of complex systems](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/teaching/courses/300) and [complex networks](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/teaching/courses/303) at UVM. His research covers complex systems and networks in general, with recent work focusing on social contagion, sociotechnical phenomena, happiness, language, and stories.

We recently published an article titled [Collective Philanthropy: Describing and Modeling the Ecology of Giving](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0098876)
in [PLOS ONE](http://www.plosone.org/). We found that philanthropic gifting appears to follow an approximate power-law size distribution, and detailed forms of gift-size distributions differ across but are relatively constant within charity categories. We showed how knowledge of gift-sized distributions may be used to assess an institution's gift-giving profile, to help set fundraising goals, and to design an institution-specific giving pyramid.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

I am [Dr. Malika Ihle](https://malikaihle.wordpress.com/) and I am currently a post doctorate researcher at the [University of Sheffield](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/aps) in the UK. I conducted my PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for Ornithology (MPIO, Germany)](http://www.orn.mpg.de/en), under the great supervision of [Dr. Wolfgang Forstmeier](http://www.orn.mpg.de/409052/employee_page?c=660919 employee_id=26271) and [Prof Bart Kempenaers](http://www.orn.mpg.de/409052/employee_page?c=671278 employee_id=26312), who will both be joining me today! Prof. Bart Kempenaers is the director of the MPIO and head of the [Department of Behavioural Ecology and Evolutionary Genetics]( http://www.orn.mpg.de/2622/Department_Kempenaers); Dr. Wolfgang Forstmeier is a researcher in this department, principal investigator of the evolution of sexual behaviour in zebra finches.
We are all researching why and how female birds choose their partner, on what criteria, and also why some females are faithful to their partner while others are not.

We recently published an article titled [The fitness benefits of mate choice for compatibility in a socially monogamous species](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002248) in [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology). We wanted to understand why female zebra finches differ in their mating preferences: do they pick compatible partners instead of high-quality ones?

We compared the reproductive success of birds that bred with their chosen partner, to the fitness of birds that were forced to pair with the chosen partner of another bird.

We found that individuals of chosen pairs had 37 percent more offspring than individuals of assigned pairs, not because they were genetically more compatible but because they were behaviourally more compatible: they were better at rearing chicks together. Individuals of chosen pairs were also more faithful to each other; females were more inclined to mate with their chosen partner, and males were more willing to invest into paternal care. Overall, it seems that each specific bird was, rather idiosyncratically, attracted and stimulated by their specific favourite mate, a phenomenon that some people might more commonly call love. In this case at least, love did have fitness consequences.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit, were Tisha Wheeler and Elizabeth Mziray, and we work at global health agencies that are leading the global response for key populations in the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.

My name is Tisha Wheeler, and I am a senior HIV/AIDS advisor for key populations at the [United States Agency for International Development (USAID)]( https://www.usaid.gov/), where I lead policy making, design, implementation, and evaluation of key populations HIV/AIDS programs. I am joined by Elizabeth Mziray, an operations officer with the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/), where she supports countries in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their HIV programs. She is the task team leader for the Banks technical support program in West and Central Africa that includes support for improving the scale, quality, targeting and coverage of HIV services for sex workers and their clients through integrated technical assistance and a capacity building program.

We are here to discuss a special [PLOS Collection](http://collections.plos.org) titled [Focus on Delivery   Scale: Achieving HIV Impact with Sex Workers]( http://collections.plos.org/achieving-hiv-impact). In our [collections overview](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0121145) published in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone) we highlight the evidence that shows protecting sex workers from HIV/STI  transmission is both necessary and feasible for controlling the epidemic. The eighteen papers published in this collection demonstrate the importance and scalability of existing interventions through four key themes: 1) epidemiology, data needs and modelling of sex work in generalized epidemics; 2) implementation science addressing practical aspects of intervention scale-up; 3) community mobilization and 4) the treatment cascade for sex workers living with HIV.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Albert Ko and I am a Professor at [Yale School of Public Health](https://publichealth.yale.edu/). My research focuses on identifying solutions for health problems that have emerged as a consequence of rapid urbanization, social inequity and the growth of slum settlements. I am joined by my colleague, Federico Costa, who is an Associate Professor at the [Universidade Federal da Bahia](https://www.ufba.br/) in Brazil. His research centers on how the ecology of the slum communities influences the disease emergence and transmission in such environments.

Federico and I recently published a study, titled ["Global Mortality and Morbidity of Leptospirosis: A Systematic Review"](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003898), in [PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds). This study estimated the health burden caused by leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that is transmitted by rats, livestock and other animals in environments that lack basic sanitation. We found that leptospirosis accounts for one million cases and 60,000 deaths each year, most of which occur in regions where its impact on subsistence farmers, pastoralists and slum dwellers has been neglected. Furthermore, the burden of leptospirosis is projected to rise as the global expansion of shantytowns and climate change-associated extreme weather events create the environmental conditions for intensified transmission.

We invite you to ask questions about leptospirosis, and how changes in the worlds demographics and environment are creating new health challenges and neglected diseases which impart their greatest impact on vulnerable populations.

We'll be taking your questions  at 1pm ET (10 am PT, 6 pm UTC) -- Ask Us Anything!

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


My name is Jean-Michel Drezen and I am the Research Director (CNRS, French research agency) at the [Research Institute on Insect Biology (University of Tours, France)](http://international.univ-tours.fr/institute-of-research-on-insect-biology-irbi--283147.kjsp). My research focuses on symbiotic viruses associated with parasitic wasps named bracoviruses. Parasitic wasps reproduce by injecting their eggs inside caterpillars on which wasp larvae feed. Together with the eggs wasps also inject bracovirus particles that induce immune suppression and control caterpillar development, enabling wasp larvae to colonize their host.


Together with me is Salva Herrero, Associate Professor at the [University of Valencia, Spain](http://www.uv.es/uvweb/college/en/university-valencia-1285845048380.html). His research focuses on understanding the interaction of insects with their viral and bacterial pathogens. We have also with us Elisabeth Huguet, Professor at the [ University of Tours](http://international.univ-tours.fr), her research is also on bracoviruses with more focus on their impact on host physiology.


We recently published a study titled [Recurrent Domestication by Lepidoptera of Genes from Their Parasites Mediated by Bracoviruses](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005470), published in [PLOS Genetics](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics). In our study we have detected in the genomes of several species of butterflies and moths, including the famous Monarch (Danaus plexippus), the insertion of active genes derived from bracoviruses. Additional results have revealed that these genes can confer a certain protection against infections with other insect pathogenic viruses. Some of the genes have been previously acquired by the bracovirus from the wasp gene pool indicating that a gene flux exists between wasps and their caterpillar hosts. We think we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg and that in fact many lepidopteran species may have acquired genes via bracoviruses.


We will be answering your questions at 1pm ET, and hope this discussion will expand our views on the topic  Ask Us Anything! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


I am Yael Velleman, a Senior Policy Analyst for Health   Hygiene at [WaterAid](http://www.wateraid.org/us). My work focuses on the links between water, sanitation and hygiene and health, and the implications for policy and programs.


I am Pinaki Panigrahi, a professor of Epidemiology, Pediatrics, and Environmental-Agricultural-and-Occupational Health at the [University of Nebraska Medical Center](http://www.unmc.edu), and also the Director of the [Center for Global Health and Development](http://www.unmc.edu/publichealth/cghad/) at the College of Public Health at University of Nebraska. My current research focus is to study the impact of environmental exposures on maternal and child health.


I am Oliver Cumming, a Lecturer in the Environmental Health in [Department of Disease Control](http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/itd/dcd) at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](http://www.lshtm.ac.uk). My research focuses on access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene and its impacts on childhood health and development.


We recently published papers in [PLOS Medicine](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/) examining the impacts of water and sanitation programs on public health.


In a paper titled "[From Joint Thinking to Joint Action: A Call to Action on Improving Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene for Maternal and Newborn Health](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001771)," Yael and Oliver, in collaboration with several UN and academic agencies and institutions, set out the case for action on water, sanitation and hygiene for improving maternal and newborn health, and provided a set of policy recommendations.


In "[Risk of Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes among Women Practicing Poor Sanitation in Rural India: A Population-Based Prospective Cohort Study](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001851)," Pinaki and colleagues found that open defecation led to more adverse pregnancy outcomes. The study enrolled more than 600 pregnant women and researchers tracked their sanitation practice during pregnancy. Those practicing open defecation had higher number of bad pregnancy outcomes, especially preterm births. Many other concomitant factors were also studied (apart from defecation practice), and against conventional wisdom, we did not find socioeconomic status to play any role in this, but the pregnant womans education did. More research is needed to identify changes that are induced by open defecation ultimately driving an unhealthy pregnancy.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


October 15  25 is [Open Access Week](http://openaccessweek.org/) and this year's theme is "Open For Collaboration". PLOS authors Dr. John Ioannidis and Dr. Robert M. Kaplan are leading this AMA to discuss how more comprehensive reporting in scientific research can lead to more study replication, stronger statistical methods, and improvements to scientific standards, all of which are hallmarks of open access publishing.


In ["How to Make More Published Research True"](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001747), an essay in [PLOS Medicine](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine), Dr. John Ioannidis examined the factors behind false or exaggerated results in research and proposed solutions for improving the efficiency and value of scientific investigation.


Dr. Robert M. Kaplan co-authored a [PLOS One](http://journals.plos.org/plosone) study, ["Likelihood of Null Effects of Large NHLBI Clinical Trials Has Increased over Time"](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132382), which found that the number of null findings increased after the [National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/) adopted more transparent reporting standards.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


We're Ben Inglis and JB Poline, two scientists who work at the [Brain Imaging Center (BIC)](http://bic.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/).

I'm Ben, and I am the manager and physicist at the [Brain Imaging Center (BIC)](http://bic.berkeley.edu/). My research focuses on the use of MRI to study physiology and biochemistry in the brain and my primary responsibility is to assist BIC users in acquiring good functional MRI data. I was recently interviewed for the PLOS Neuro blog in a post called ["FMRI under the Microscope"](http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/2015/01/28/fmri-under-the-microscope-an-interview-with-mri-physicist-practical-fmri/). Using my own blog, [practiCal fMRI](http://practiCalfMRI.blogspot.com), I am trying to help improve fMRI acquisition methodology anywhere, including at Berkeley, through education. The Internet is an excellent medium for sharing tips on fMRI. My hope is that by accelerating the discourse via blogs and forums like AMA we will see an overall improvement in the quality of functional imaging studies.



My name is JB Poline and my research focuses on statistical analysis methods for brain imaging and brain imaging genetics, as well as neuroinformatics. I recently published a study titled ["Orthogonalization of Regressors in fMRI Models"](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0126255) in [PLOS One](http://journals.plos.org/plosone), which explained a common pitfall when using the linear model in fMRI analyses. More generally, I am interested in the reproducibility of fMRI and neuroimaging studies.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit!


I am Tom Kaye, Associate Researcher with the [Burke Museum](http://www.burkemuseum.org/) in Seattle, Washington. My research uses lasers to make fossils and minerals fluoresce in ways never seen before. My team recently published a paper in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone) titled [Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence in Paleontology](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0125923) where in one example we used our system to identify the origin of a bracelet that was placed around the arm of a 6,000 year old skeleton of a girl. We also demonstrated the use of laser fluorescence to automatically sort microfossils, its ability to back light feathers preserved as carbon films and light up micro-fossils that were normally invisible under the surface. We are also taking the laser underground and using it to fluoresce and photograph cave formations at great distances!

I hope to answer lots of interesting questions at the PLOS AMA at 1pm ET (10 am PT, 5 pm UTC), and you can follow my science adventures on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tom.kaye.35).

<TITLE> PLOS Science Wednesday: Hi Reddit, I'm Zhengquan Yu, here to talk about my recent PLOS Genetics paper that has identified the key role of a microRNA in hair loss. I'm joined by Maksim Plikus, who studies stem cell regulation using hair follicles  Ask Us Anything! </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


My name is Zhengquan Yu and I am an associate professor at the [China Agricultural University](http://www.cau.edu.cn/). Joining me in this AMA is my colleague, Maksim Plikus from the [University of California, Irvine](http://uci.edu/), who studies the principles and mechanisms of adult stem cell regulation using hair follicle as the primary model system.



My research focuses on regulatory network of somatic stem cells in hair follicle and mammary gland. We recently published a research article titled [Post-transcriptional Regulation of Keratinocyte Progenitor Cell Expansion, Differentiation and Hair Follicle Regression by miR-22](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005253) in [PLOS Genetics](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics). We describe an essential role for a highly conserved microRNA, miR-22, in regulating the regression of mouse hair follicles. We found that increasing miR-22 results in hair loss in mice due to the premature regression of follicles, and that silencing of keratin-mediated hair shaft assembly by miR-22 is a prerequisite for follicle regression. There are hundreds of microRNAs expressed in hair follicles, but most of them are not well studied. This paper highlights the importance of determining the combinatorial effects of the microRNA regulatory network in hair cycling and provides new insights into the mechanism of premature hair follicle regression in understanding the pathology of hair loss.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is David Frayer and I am a retired professor at the [University of Kansas](https://anthropology.ku.edu/david-w-frayer). My research focuses on paleoanthropology, with an emphasis on later European human evolution and, most recently, on the relationship between Neandertals and the humans that followed them.



I recently published an article with three Croatian colleagues (Davorka Radovi, Ankica Oros Sren   Jakov Radovi) titled [Evidence for Neandertal Jewelry: Modified White-Tailed Eagle Claws at Krapina](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0119802) in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone). The study documents eight talons and a foot bone from the [Krapina Neandertal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krapina) site in Croatia, dated at 130,000 years ago. These elements bear cut marks, highly polished areas on some talons and a dull sheen on their sides indicating that Neandertals assembled them into jewelry. These talons, along with other paleocultural evidence, provide multiple new lines of evidence for Neandertals abilities and cultural sophistication.

<TITLE> PLOS Science Wednesday: We're Laura Pollitt and Andrew Read, and we found that mosquitoes can harbor multiple infections of the malaria parasite at once and transmit a double-dose of malaria infection, Ask Us Anything! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-16 14:00:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


My name is Laura Pollitt and I am a research fellow in the [Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution](http://ciie.bio.ed.ac.uk/) at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/home). Joining me is Andrew Read who is the director of the [Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics](http://www.cidd.psu.edu/) at [Pennsylvania State University](http://www.psu.edu/).


Andrew is interested in applying an evolutionary approach to medical problems, a field sometimes referred to as evolutionary medicine. He has worked on various disease systems but is best known for his work on malaria where he has looked for solutions to the rising problem of drug resistance in the parasites that cause the disease and insecticide resistance in the mosquitoes that transmit the parasites.


Laura is interested in how different strains of malaria parasites interact within infections across the whole of their life cycle. In particular, what impact this has on parasite evolution and transmission.


Along with other colleagues, we recently published a study titled [Existing infection facilitates establishment and density of malaria parasites in the mosquito vector](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005003) in [PLOS Pathogens](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens). Very little is known about how malaria parasite strains interact with each other inside mosquitoes. In this study, we show that mosquitoes that have already been infected with one strain of malaria parasites are more likely to become infected with a new strain. Moreover, the presence of an existing infection enhances the replication of malaria parasites with no obvious impact on mosquito survival.


We will be answering your questions at 1pm ET (10 am PT, 5 pm UTC).  Ask Us Anything!

<TITLE> PLOS Science Wednesdays: Hi, Im Stuart Kim here to talk about gene sequencing the worlds oldest people to unlock the secrets of human longevity, AMA! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-09 14:00:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is [Dr. Stuart Kim]( https://chemsysbio.stanford.edu/faculty-profiles/kim-stuart/) and I am professor at [Stanford University]( https://www.stanford.edu/). My research focuses on genes that contribute to extreme longevity, such as supercentenarians that live to be over 110 years.

I recently published a study titled [Whole Genome Sequencing of the World's Oldest People](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0112430) in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone). [Supercentenarians]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercentenarian) are the world's oldest people, with just 17 or so alive in the United States at any time. Supercentenarians often show a remarkable delay in aging, such as one that worked as a physician in Georgia until age 103 and another that worked as a stockbroker on Wall Street until age 109. In order to begin to find the genetic basis for extreme longevity, we sequenced the genomes of 17 supercentenarians. The full genome sequences of the supercentenarians are available as supplemental data from the paper, and we hope that our data contributes to future research to unlock the secret for extreme longevity.

Thank you everyone for your questions, it was a pleasure to answer your questions. I think trying to understand the biology of aging is really interesting and I hope you find it interesting too.  I've signed off for now.

Best wishes,
Stuart Kim

<TITLE> PLOS Science Wednesday: Hi, we're Caitlin Dunn, Deborah McFarland and Kelly Callahan, and we published a study in PLOS NTDs about how onchocerciasis (river blindness) programs helped achieve the aims of certain Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  Ask Us Anything! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-02 14:00:18 </DATE>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit!


My name is Caitlin Dunn, and I am a Program Officer at John Snow, Inc., a public health consulting and management organization located in Boston, Massachusetts. Joining me for today's AMA is Kelly Callahan, Director of the [Trachoma Control Program](http://www.cartercenter.org/health/trachoma/index.html) for [The Carter Center](http://www.cartercenter.org), based in Atlanta, Georgia, and Dr. Deborah McFarland, Associate Professor at [Emory University Rollins School of Public Health](http://www.sph.emory.edu/). We published an article titled "[The Contributions of Onchocerciasis Control and Elimination Programs toward the Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals](http://www.plosntds.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003703)" in [PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs)](http://www.plosntds.org/). This article was a literature and data review which found that reducing the burden of onchocerciasis in highly endemic areas contributes to achieving several Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).



Here is a little bit about us:



Caitlin Dunn currently provides backstopping support to two USAID-funded health programs: a health systems strengthening program focused on improving maternal and child health outcomes in Pakistan and a program looking at data quality of PEPFAR indicators in Mozambique. This article was written as part of Ms. Dunns thesis, A Retrospective Review of Onchocerciasis Control and Elimination Program Contributions to the Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals while at the Rollins School of Public Health in partnership with The Carter Center, where she served as a Graduate Research Assistant.



Dr. Deborah A. McFarland is on the faculty of the Department of Global Health and the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Rollins School of Public Health of Emory University. Dr. McFarland has been involved in health policy, health systems and health financing issues for the past 30 years, both in the U.S. and internationally. Dr. McFarland is a current member of the [WHO NTD Strategic Technical Advisory Group (STAG)](http://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/gh/), a former member of the [APOC Technical Consultative Committee](http://www.who.int/apoc/about/structure/tcc/en/), the [Mectizan Expert Committee](http://www.mectizan.org/about/mectizan-expert-committee) and WHO TDR group on community-based interventions for NTDs.



Kelly Callahan works in program implementation towards eradication, elimination and control of specific NTDs. Ms. Callahan focuses specifically on eliminating blinding trachoma as a public health problem by 2020 in six countries. In line with this interest in the NTDs, she has published other key articles also printed in PLOS NTDs that are relevant to this topic: "[Trachoma Control as a Vehicle Toward International Development and Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003137)"
and "[Contributions of the Guinea Worm Disease Eradication Campaign toward Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002160)".



Ms. Callahan believes there are several salient points in these three articles:

     *   Given the prominence of the MDGs in the development of global health agendas, it is important to consider greater implementation of NTD strategies in achieving the MDGs (and from the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals); and
     *   Emerging evidence shows people infected with NTDs are more susceptible to becoming infected with the big three (HIV, malaria, tuberculosis). Evidence also indicates that coinfection with one or more NTDs may adversely and exponentially affect the patient's prognosis of having one of the big three diseases.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Corina Logan and I am a [Leverhulme Early Career Research Fellow]( https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/funding/grant-schemes/early-career-fellowships) at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/). I study behavioral flexibility in birds: their ability to adapt their behavior to changing circumstances.

I recently published a study titled [Modifications to the Aesops Fable paradigm change performances in New Caledonian crows](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0103049) in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone). My colleagues and I set out to understand how New Caledonian crows solve novel foraging problems involving a clear tube that is partially filled with water and contains a floating food reward. Dropping objects into the water to raise the water level and bring the food within reach solves the problem. We found that crows can discriminate between water volumes: they dropped more objects into the narrower tube rather than the wider tube when the initial water levels were the same in both tubes, and they switched their preference later when the wide tube became the functional option. Also, one crow appeared to inhibit attention to causal cues to learn to associate the color of one tube with receiving food in its adjacent tube.

I will be available to answer your questions at 1pm ET (10am PT, 6pm GMT) so Ask me Anything!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My name is Dr. Camilo Mora and I am an assistant professor at the [University of Hawaii Manoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/). My research focuses on understanding the feedback loops between people and biodiversity. My earlier career was on basic ecology, but then I realized that the effects of people on various species were massive and already evident. Quantifying such impacts and their feedbacks on people represent the main topic of my latest research.


And my name is Dr. Iain Caldwell and I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [University of Hawaii Manoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/). I am an ecologist with broad interests in how organisms can respond to changes in their environment, including the potential consequences of projected climate changes for such organisms.


Along with several colleagues from the University of Hawaii and the [University of Montana](http://www.umt.edu/), we recently published a study in [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology) titled [Suitable Days for Plant Growth Disappear under Projected Climate Change: Potential Human and Biotic Vulnerability](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002167). In this paper, we explored the potential consequences of projected climate changes on future plant growth worldwide, and what that could mean for various ecosystems and the people that depend on those ecosystems.


Our findings indicate that, if climate change continues as it has in the past, there could be significant global declines in the number of suitable plant growing days by 2100; with the most drastic changes affecting people in the poorest countries of the world. There is hope though; as our results also indicate that if we can curb our global carbon emissions, these changes in plant-growing conditions should be far less severe.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

Im Jim Hansen, a professor at [Columbia Universitys Earth Institute]( http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/sections/view/9).http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/sections/view/9 I'm  joined today by 3 colleagues who are scientists representing different aspects of climate science and coauthors on papers we'll be talking about on this AMA.

--Paul Hearty, paleoecologist and professor at University of North Carolina at Wilmington, NC Dept. of Environmental Studies. I study the geology of sea-level changes

--George Tselioudis, of NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies; I head a research team that analyzes observations and model simulations to investigate cloud, radiation, and precipitation changes with climate and the resulting radiative feedbacks.

--Pushker Kharecha from Columbia University Earth Institute; I study the global carbon cycle; the exchange of carbon in its various forms among the different components of the climate system --atmosphere, land, and ocean.

Today we make the case for urgent action to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which are on the verge of locking in highly undesirable consequences, leaving young people with a climate system out of humanity's control. Not long after my 1988 testimony to Congress, when I concluded that human-made climate change had begun, practically all nations agreed in a 1992 United Nations Framework Convention to reduce emissions so as to avoid dangerous human-made climate change.  Yet little has been done to achieve that objective.

I am glad to have the opportunity today to discuss with researchers and general science readers here on redditscience an alarming situation  as the science reveals climate threats that are increasingly alarming, policymakers propose only ineffectual actions while allowing continued development of fossil fuels that will certainly cause disastrous consequences for today's young people. Young people need to understand this situation and stand up for their rights.

To further a broad exchange of views on the implications of this research, my colleagues and I have published in a variety of open access journals, including, in [PLOS ONE]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone), [Assessing Dangerous Climate Change: Required Reduction of Carbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature (2013)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648),
[PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone), [Assessing Dangerous Climate Change: Required Reduction of Carbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature (2013)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648), and most recently, [Ice Melt, Sea Level Rise and Superstorms: Evidence from the Paleoclimate Data, Climate Modeling that 2 C Global Warming is Highly Dangerous](http://www.columbia.edu/%7Ejeh1/2015/20150704_IceMelt.pdf), in [Atmos. Chem.   Phys. Discussions](http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/volumes_and_issues.html) (July, 2015).

One conclusion we share in the latter paper is that ice sheet models that guided [IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)](http://www.ipcc.ch/) sea level projections and upcoming United Nations meetings in Paris are far too sluggish compared with the magnitude and speed of sea level changes in the paleoclimate record. An implication is that continued high emissions likely would result in multi-meter sea level rise this century and lock in continued ice sheet disintegration such that building cities or rebuilding cities on coast lines would become foolish.

The bottom line message we as scientists should deliver to the public and to policymakers is that we have a global crisis, an emergency that calls for global cooperation to reduce emissions as rapidly as practical. We conclude and reaffirm in our present paper that the crisis calls for an across-the-board rising carbon fee and international technical cooperation in carbon-free technologies. This urgent science must become part of a global conversation about our changing climate and what all citizens can do to make the world livable for future generations.

Joining me is my co-author, Professor Paul Hearty, a professor at University of North Carolina  Wilmington.

---------------------------------

Hi Reddit, 

My name is Laura Jurgens and I am a postdoctoral researcher at Temple University and Smithsonian Institution. My research focuses on how marine organisms, and the interacting communities they form, respond to extreme events and global change.

Together with a wonderful group of collaborators, I recently published a study titled ["Patterns of Mass Mortality among Rocky Shore Invertebrates across 100 km of Northeastern Pacific Coastline"](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0126280) in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org). In it, we describe an unusual event that killed nearly 100% of two species, a tiny sea star and a sea urchin, over a large region, following a harmful algal bloom or "red tide". We discuss why it's especially important, but often hard, to document such events, which may be increasing in severity and frequency with human-induced changes to our oceans. We also discuss how lifestyle differences between the affected species could determine how long it takes them to recover, and what that means for coastal ecosystems.

I will be answering your questions at 1pm ET. Ask me Anything!

<TEXT> Hi Reddit, were Sten Vermund and Akhenaten Tankwanchi, we just published a paper about the impacts of brain drain or the migration of the health workforce from Sub-Saharan Africa to the United States  Ask Us Anything!

My name is Sten Vermund, and I am a professor of pediatrics and the Director of the (Vanderbilt Institute for Global Health)[http://globalhealth.vanderbilt.edu/] at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. My primary research focus is on infectious disease control and prevention in low-income countries. Joining me for todays AMA is the lead author of our work, Dr. Akhenaten Tankwanchi, a Washington, D.C.-based consultant now in the job market. Akhenaten holds a PhD in community research and action from Vanderbilt University's (Peabody School of Education and Human Development)[ http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/]. His current research interest is on health workforce migration from Africa and its implication for development and global health policy.

We recently published a paper titled (Monitoring Sub-Saharan African Physician Migration Post-Adoption of the WHO Code of Practice: Temporal and Geographic Patterns in United States)[ http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124734] in (PLOS ONE)[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124734].  In this study, we examined available data on physicians originating from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and appearing in the AMA Masterfile with the primary aim of evaluating the effectiveness of the (WHO Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel)[http://www.who.int/hrh/migration/code/practice/en/] in decreasing the emigration of SSA physicians from the continent of greatest need. Our findings suggest that the non-binding WHO Code of Practice has not slowed physician emigration from SSA to the United States (U.S.). In fact, we observed an increasing trend in the number of SSA migrant physicians recruited into the U.S. physician workforce.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

My name is Dr. Todd Eckdahl and I am a Professor of Biology at [Missouri Western State University]( https://www.missouriwestern.edu/). I collaborate with Dr. Malcolm Campbell and Dr. Laurie Heyer of Davidson College, Dr. Jeff Poet of Missouri Western State University, and undergraduate students studying biology and mathematics on our two campuses.  Our research focuses on using Synthetic Biology to improve metabolic engineering of bacteria for applications in medicine, energy, and bioremediation.

We recently published a paper titled [Programmed Evolution for Optimization of Orthogonal Metabolic Output in Bacteria] (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118322) in [PLOS ONE]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone). Our approach is called Programmed Evolution and captures two concepts. First, a population of cells is programmed with DNA code to enable it to compute solutions to a chosen optimization problem. Second, the system employs the evolution of bacteria toward an optimal metabolic solution by imposing fitness defined by metabolic output. Our study is a proof-of-concept for Programmed Evolution applied to the optimization of a metabolic pathway for the conversion of caffeine to an asthma medication called theophylline in E. coli.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

Our names are Sabrina Engesser, Simon Townsend, James Savage and Andy Russell. We recently published a paper titled [Experimental Evidence for Phonemic Contrasts in a Nonhuman Vocal System]( http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002171) in [PLOS Biology]( http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology). Through studying the vocalization of the highly social chestnut-crowned babbler, we found that these birds reuse meaningless acoustic elements in different arrangements to generate new signals. While it was previously assumed that such phonemic capacities are limited to humans, our study shows that the ability to generate basic phoneme-like structures exists outside of humans and provides insight into potential early steps in the evolution of human language.

SABRINA ENGESSER - I am a PhD student at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies at the [University of Zurich]( http://www.uzh.ch/index_en.html) in Switzerland. My work focuses on the combinatorial mechanisms vocally constrained animals apply to increase their basic vocal repertoire, and its implications for the evolution of human language. I am currently studying two highly social birds, the chestnut-crowned babbler from outback Australia and the pied babbler from southern Africa.

SIMON TOWNSEND - I am a Group Leader at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies at the [University of Zurich]( http://www.uzh.ch/index_en.html), but have recently taken up an Assistant Professorship in Psychology at the [University of Warwick]( http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/) in the UK. I am particularly interested in how and why the human capacity for language evolved. To this end, I study primate and non-primate mammals and birds in the wild and captivity to shed light on the origins of this stand-out feature of human behaviour.

JAMES SAVAGE - I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Animal Sciences at Wageningen University, the Netherlands. I work on parental care behaviour, primarily looking at how parents (and helpers in cooperative systems) respond to each other when feeding offspring. I did my PhD on chestnut-crowned babbler in Australia, and currently work on great tits in the Netherlands.

ANDY RUSSELL - I am an Associate Professor in Animal Behaviour at the [University of Exeter](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/) in the UK. My research focuses on understanding the causes and consequences of cooperative breeding systems, wherein non-breeders help to rear the offspring of breeders. I have worked on meerkats and humans, but now primarily work on chestnut-crowned babblers from outback Australia.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My name is [Dr. Jan Heng](http://scholar.harvard.edu/janheng/home) and I am a Research Fellow at [Harvard Medical School]( http://hms.harvard.edu/). My research focuses on applying novel technologies and analytical methods to better understand disease pathogenesis and the integration of various types of data (clinical, epidemiological, genomics and proteomics) to improve disease diagnostics and therapeutics in womens health.

I recently published a research study titled [Whole Blood Gene Expression Profile Associated with Spontaneous Preterm Birth in Women with Threatened Preterm Labor]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096901) in [PLOS One](http://journals.plos.org/plosone). My colleagues and I discovered a set of nine genes, when combined with clinical data, could predict if a women with signs of premature labor (i.e. in threatened preterm labor) would or would not deliver a premature infant within 48 hours of hospital admission. Women admitted for threatened preterm labor are often unnecessarily hospitalized, and we wanted to develop a test that can differentiate between true and false labor so that women in truly threatened labor will receive appropriate medical care while women in false labor will receive supportive care and be discharged.

Looking forward to answering your questions at 1pm EDT. Ask me Anything!

Edit  Thank you for your wonderful contributions, I had an awesome time! I would to thank my co-authors on this PLoS publication especially Professor Stephen Lye. I would also like to acknowledge my current PI, Dr Andrew Beck and Ben Glass for supporting me during this AMA.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> PLOS Science Wednesdays: Hi Reddit, were Amy Morrison and Sarah Anne Guagliardo, here to discuss our paper that found river boats contribute to the spread of Dengue Fever in the Peruvian Amazon  AUA! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-01 14:08:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Im Dr. Amy Morrison, and I am Project Scientist in the [Department of Entomology and Nematology]( http://entomology.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis, but also I am the Scientific Director for the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6 (NAMRU-6) Iquitos Field Laboratory. I have lived and worked in the Amazonian City of Iquitos, Peru for the last 17 years on a series of prospective epidemiological studies (7 large multi-year cohort studies following about 5,000 people each) to understand the role of Aedes aegypti in dengue virus transmission dynamics.


And Im Sarah Anne Guagliardo, and I currently serve as an [ASPPH Allan Rosenfield Global Health Fellow]( https://fellowships.aspph.org/programs/details.cfm?programID=2) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I recently completed my PhD at Emory University in [Population Biology, Ecology, and Evolution]( http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/PBEE/), with an emphasis on the ecology of infectious diseases. My doctoral research focused on how human transportation networks are responsible for the geographic range expansion of mosquito Aedes aegypti in the Peruvian Amazon. Ae. aegypti transmits many pathogens, the most important of which is dengue virus.


[Our previous research]( http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003033) showed that this urban mosquito is in the process of invading peri-urban and rural communities throughout the region. To expand upon this finding, we compared mosquito infestation rates in different kinds of vehicles commonly found in the Amazon, such as large barges and water taxis. We found that large barges are heavily infested with Ae.aegypti. As it turns out, these boats provide ideal conditions for mosquitoes  cargo holds in the bottom of the boats often contain puddles that serve as mosquito breeding grounds. Our findings showed that mosquitoes commonly hitch rides on barges, and that boat traffic ultimately contributes to Ae. aegypti spread throughout the Peruvian Amazon. Findings in this article illustrate how easily and efficiently dengue virus can be spread between large urban centers, and are reported in our recent article in [PLOS NTDs]( http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/), [River Boats Contribute to the Regional Spread of the Dengue Vector Aedes aegypti in the Peruvian Amazon](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003648)


As dengue fever continues to be a serious global public health problem, it is essential that scientists understand the geographic distribution of its primary vector, Ae. aegypti.

<TEXT> My name is Miriam Barlow and I am an Associate Professor at [UC Merced]( http://www.ucmerced.edu/). My research focuses on Antibiotic Resistance and Evolutionary Time Travel.

And name is Juan Meza and I am a Professor in Applied Mathematics at UC Merced. My research focuses on optimization and scientific computing. My role on the research team was to show how to rewind the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria by using mathematical models to predict the best combination of antibiotic treatments.

We recently published a study titled ["Rational Design of Antibiotic Treatment Plans: A Treatment Strategy for Managing Evolution and Reversing Resistance"]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0122283) in [PLOS One](http://journals.plos.org/plosone). We showed how to rewind the evolution of bacteria and verify treatment options for a family of 15 antibiotics, including penicillin, used to fight common infections. This work shows that there is still hope for antibiotics if we use them intelligently.

<TEXT> Hi, Im Manica Balasegaram, executive director of the [Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) Access Campaign](http://www.msfaccess.org/), where we work to increase access to essential medicines for all. I worked for years as an MSF physician in the field in several African countries and in the Indian sub-continent, where I experienced firsthand the dire need for research and development for drugs, where the market does not incentivize.

Im Bernard Pcoul, executive director of the [Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative]( http://www.dndi.org/), a non-profit research and development organization that uses public and private funding and partnerships, spanning from governments to pharmaceutical companies, to develop and deliver treatments for neglected diseases. I started out as an MSF field doctor where I discovered the extent to which neglected populations were left behind by the vast medical advances of the past half-century.

Were here to discuss our recent article in [PLOS Medicine]( http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine), titled [A Global Biomedical R D Fund and Mechanism for Innovations of Public Health Importance](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001831). The paper calls for a broad framework for funding and coordinating research and development for Ebola, Antibiotic Resistance, and Neglected Diseases initiatives in low-and-middle income countries. We see investing in health as a cost-saving and lifesaving strategy, and called upon the global community to invest in a biomedical R D fund at the recent [G7 Summit]( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/05/g7-bavaria-angela-merkel-summit-26-hours-trade-ebola-oompah) in Germany.

<TEXT> Hi Reddit!  My name is Seth Blumberg.  I am a physician-scientist based out of the [University of California, San Francisco](http://www.ucsf.edu) and [St. Marys Medical Center](http://www.stmarysmedicalcenter.org/index.htm). Joining me for today's AMA is Jennifer Zipprich, an epidemiologist with the Immunization Branch at the California Department of Public Health.  

SETH BLUMBERG - I am involved in research concerning the emergence and re-emergence of infectious disease.  Along with a wonderful group of collaborators, I recently published a study titled [Assessing Measles Transmission in the United States Following a Large Outbreak in California]( http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/assessing-measles-transmission-in-the-united-states-following-a-large-outbreak-in-california/), in [PLOS Currents]( http://currents.plos.org). In this article, we analyze the recent outbreak of measles at Disneyland. The key question is whether or not the transmission of measles has increased to the point where it may once again become endemic in the United States.  Fortunately, we find that the transmission of measles is probably still controlled, but that vaccination remains an essential public health policy.  There have been a lot of conflicting reports on the benefit of measles vaccination, and our research helps to clarify why measles vaccination is important.

JENNIFER ZIPPRICH works with a team of epidemiologists to investigate cases and outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases, including measles. On April 17th her team declared the measles outbreak associated with Disneyland over, however, measles is still a threat internationally and importations into the U.S. continue to occur. She looks forward to answering your questions about measles prevention and control  Ask Us Anything!

My name is [Jelte Wicherts] (https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/webwijs/show/j.m.wicherts.htm) and I am an associate professor at Tilburg University in The Netherlands, where I lead the Human Factors in Statistics group. Our research focuses on how researchers in the social sciences deal with the analysis of their data, errors with statistics, publication bias, and reproducibility.
I recently published a study titled [Why Publishing Everything Is More Effective than Selective Publishing of Statistically Significant Results] (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0084896) in PLOS ONE. In this article, we argue that the best way forward in science is to publish all results rather than just those that are significant. We used simulation, a data fabrication technique that is ethically acceptable because it lets us see what happens in particular circumstances, to show that publishing all relevant results leads to much better estimates of effects in the literature. Publishing these results in PLOS ONE aligns closely with the journals guidelines to not focus exclusively on novel or important results, but instead publishes sound research regardless of whether results are significant or not. **I will be answering your questions on May 27 at 1pm EST  AMA!**

<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

 My name is [Dr. Megan Head](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/head-ml), and I am a post-doctoral research associate in the Research School of Biological Sciences at The Australian National University. I am an evolutionary biologist that researches how interactions between males and females influence evolution, but I am also dedicated to maintaining integrity and rigor in the scientific process.


In line with this latter interest, I published a Perspective Article titled [The Extent and Consequences of P-hacking in Science] (http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106) in PLOS Biology. P-hacking is a practice where researchers analyze their data multiple times or in multiple ways until they get the desired result, for example, a p-value  0.05. This paper shows that p-hacking is rampant in science, but that it does not seem to influence the conclusions drawn from meta-analysis, at least in our case study of meta-analyses conducted in evolutionary ecology. The paper highlights common methods of p-hacking, and offers suggestions for how researchers and journals can prevent p-hacking.

<TEXT> Hi reddit!

 We study the evolution of intelligence by conducting experiments in computational simulations of evolution. Our work not only sheds light on the evolution of intelligence in natural animals, but will also accelerate attempts to create artificial intelligence (AI). Individually, we are:


         Kai Olav Ellefsen, who recently received a Ph.D. from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and is currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Brazilian Institute of Robotics 


         Jean-Baptiste Mouret, who is an associate scientist at Inria (France), and previously was an assistant professor at Pierre   Marie Curie University (France), and


         Jeff Clune, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Wyoming, who directs the [Evolving Artificial Intelligence laboratory] (http://EvolvingAI.org)


Our [recent PLOS Computational Biology paper](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004128) suggests that when computational brain models called neural networks are organized into modules they are better at learning new information without forgetting old knowledge. The brains of animals (including humans) are modular, which means they have many separate units, such as those for language and facial recognition. While natural animals tend to forget gradually, artificial neural networks currently exhibit what is called 'catastrophic forgetting, meaning they rapidly overwrite previously acquired knowledge when learning a new skill. We found that modularity significantly reduced such catastrophic forgetting in these computer brains.
 

For summaries of the work, please watch our [summary video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PlvyWQUQu8),  read [a story about the work in the Atlantic] (http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/04/teaching-a-computer-not-to-forget/389727/), or [listen to a BBC interview about the research](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02n93fn) (the section on our work starts at 1:24).

My research interests include the evolution and biology of horned dinosaurs, as well as reconstructing extinct ecosystems from the end of the Age of Dinosaurs. Im also the volunteer section editor for paleontology at PLOS ONE.

The [research article](http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/04/plos/%20http:/journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0112055) Ill be talking about in this AMA is about Aquilops a newly discovered and named dinosaur who, at around 106 million years old,  turns out to be the oldest horned dinosaur (the lineage including Triceratops) named from North America, besting the previous record by nearly 20 million years. No bigger than a bunny rabbit, its also incredibly small (for a dinosaur) and cute. So, after finding only a skull how did we figure this out? Come to our PLOS redditscience AMA and youll find out.

Here are two posts I wrote on my PLOS blog about this research, the first introducing [Aquilops](http://blogs.plos.org/paleo/2014/12/10/aquilops-hello/) and [then telling the story](http://blogs.plos.org/paleo/2014/12/11/assembling-aquilops-paper/)  of how our team assembled this paper.

We are [Tom Baden](https://tombaden.wordpress.com) and [Andre Maia Chagas](https://www.mendeley.com/profiles/andre-maia-chagas/), and we are neuroscience researchers at the Centre for Integrative Neuroscience (CIN) at the University of Tbingen, Germany. We are also part of [TReND in Africa](http://trendinafrica.org), a scientist-run NGO aimed at fostering science education and research on the African continent. We are active in the Maker-Movement where we aim to promote the use of open source software and hardware approaches in research and education.
We recently published a [community page](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002086) in PLOS Biology on the use of consumer oriented 3-D printing and microcontrollers for the building of sophisticated yet low-cost laboratory equipment, or Open Labware. We argue that today it is possible to establish a fully operational home-factory for well below 1,000 USD. This is opening up new grounds for scientists, educators as well as hobbyists outside the traditional scientific establishment to make real contributions to the advancement of science tools and science in general, while at the same time allowing grant money to be used more effectively also at the financially more established institutions. We actively promote these ideas and tools at training courses at universities across Africa, while our co-authors and colleagues from the US-based [Backyard Brains](https://www.backyardbrains.com/) are running similar activities across Latin America.
