It really is great, I was always trying to hold up a diffuser in front of my flash, so it's so much better, but wind is a concern.

<TEXT> So I was in Zimbabwe on a hike with 2 adults and about 12 teenagers, we were not following a path and just using a map on a three day trip to these waterfalls (car was there to pick us up). 
We come to a dam with a 20-30m aria of beach sand, this is very unnatural and caused a lot of discussion. Where the beach stopped there where granite boulders and large rocks, it was very attractive and we decided to set up camp early. 1 hour later someone finds this cave, the mouth was small and we had to go down on all fours to get in, but once inside, wow. 3m high ceiling and 10m long it was amazing. There was a crack in the ceiling allowing a beam of light to come streaming though. Naturally, the majority of us wanted to sleep in there. 
1am I wake up being shaken and the Leader of the hike is telling everyone to get out as there is a Leopard outside and this is his lair (they often chose caves to reside in). Im not too phased as this guy is always scheming up pranks and jokes, so I rollover and pretend to sleep. Next thing I know my sleeping bag is pulled off of me and Im being ordered to get now or Im responsible for myself. I then realised he was not kidding, and scurried out, lol. 
We all then sat as close as we could to the fire was we watches the eyes of the leopard pacing up and down in the dark less than a stones throw away but has the water to our backs so we where stuck. Fortunately the leopard did not like the activity and moved off, however they hunt at night and we are pretty much sitting ducks, so I didnt sleep much that night. Every sound was a threat and every moving bush was one step closer to the end of my life. Looking at the tracks the next morning that circled the campsite, we were pretty freaking lucky. 



TL;DR 

Pretty much set up camp in a leopard's cave and where stuck between a dam and the leopard when he came back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've read through this whole thread and I've been very impressed with the time you've put into it,... thank you! 

1) I know you don't hand over the report fulled with vulnerability, wish them luck dust your hands and walk off, surely there are certain levels or standards that they have to comply too. Especially Hospitals/Banks that hold public records. 
2) Who is responsible for deciding what needs to be addresses (if there is no standard to measure against) 
3)Who is responsible for implementing the changes network/server engineers at your company or outsource? 
4)This "standard" I'm assuming exists, is it international or dose it vary with each country?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This AMA is awesome! Thanks (y) 
I am a network engineer and I'm very seriously looking into full time VA/pen-testing, however I have one major reservation- Documentation. 
How much of pen-testing is actually testing and how much of it is putting together a report. 
Like wise with actual Vulnerability Assessment and converting a Nessus scan to word. 
I get that documentation is necessary but what are ratios? I'm not really built to compile 300 page reports, just not really bent that way.

<TITLE> Has anyone tried Kali Linux on a Tablet/Phone yet? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-12 09:48:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm pretty keen to try my had at Kali Linux NetHunter on a tablet but I have a few reservations about this first and I wanted to know if any one out there as already tried and bumped their heads with any issues yet? 

If you didn't know about Kali on a mobile device then check out this link,...
https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/

So first of all, it cant be any android device and has to be a Nexus device (it's clean and stock) but is there a workaround for this? 

Secondly the Nexus 6 packs a nice punch and should be able to handle the processor load placed on the it, but would an older Nexus (i.e. Nexus 4) manage? I'm not about to fork out for a new Tab just to try out Kali on it. 

If anyone has any experience with this I'd appreciate it :) (y)
