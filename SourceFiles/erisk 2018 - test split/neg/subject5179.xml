This is in context of a discussion I had with another player. I was under the impression that DauT Cup was funded by DauT himself. He says that it was funded by a group of DauT fans (Clan in China). Please let me know what's the correct story!

Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bengalis live in West Bengal in India. [That "I know Bangladesh is a different country" was not required] 
Apart from the Pal dynasty, they don't really have much history. There still can be campaigns around Battle of Plassey, Buxar, but still not great enough to be included into the game.

Assamese? Again no great history there.
The rest are still fine, do have history, but if AoE goes that route, we will have 500 Civs to choose from! :D

Wouldn't hurt to have more elephants in the game either
There aren't enough already? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the timing of calling it quits right now will be very good. We will have 3.5 months till the next Transfer Window before which we can install the new manager. But then the question is, has the Board even finalized a candidate? Even as a backup option?[Because there is that possibility where Arsene is not ready to sign the contract provided]

I really wonder what is going on. The more I think about it, more scared I get. I can picture empty stadiums and horrendous display on the pitch for the next 10 games. Europa looks difficult in that case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, over time, players have learnt new skills, new metas because it has become extremely competitive. With technology and analysis and SOTL, players have tried to improve even further. So now, if you add all that to Grunt's or Halen's capability from back then, maybe they can compete with top players of modern times... :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Watched this game. But Chip lost the game when he went so defensive right at the beginning. You can never win against TheViper if you play that defensive. Cav Archers are a very expensive choice, Viper was surprised but amused and confident when he saw the first CA from Chip.

[Edit] - You can hear Viper talking about Map control in most of his videos, he enjoys it when his opponent goes that defensive because it gives him rest of the map.

All said, Chip did play a very good game, neat game. </TEXT>

Also, are these players (as far as AOC is concerned) still playing or do I just miss them on Voobly during my time-zone?

<TEXT> It is a good thing that guys report these Bugs all the time on all forums [This being the most visible one with the zone]. We need to work towards making the game as perfect as possible and be proud of the fact that we contributed to the cause. 

"The game is 20 years old and will be buggy" - Let us not have this attitude. We are not helping here. But yes if people rage over such things, then that is a little too much! </TEXT>

<TEXT> That reminds me of a game in recent years. I dont remember who it was, but he was playing with Celts, against Viper. Properly boomed till 25-30 mins. Viper was Mayans. Proper Seige Onager rush after 35 mins but still Viper won it, thanks to cheap Mayan Army.

Then again, that was just walling, and more walling, and defending with Onagers. Not exactly "turtling" in the true sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guys, 

Aware of any game played by good players who have done a proper Turtling (It's ok if it's an Arena game) (possibly even with Bombard Towers erected) and then attacked in Imperial and won the game? Link me or share the game file.

Thank You

I have done this before (many years back) but right now am really struggling with delivering the car "Job". The cars are basically really bad, with horrible handling and poor acceleration. The Cops surely win the chase and bust me. I can't even use PursuitBreakers as it would damage the cars.

Any suggestion/pointers? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is an incredible read. 

"I think Microsoft Game Studios has moved on, and they don't have anyone there who manages their history and back-catalog in matters like these. If for some reason, my last contact finds the opportunity and gets back to me, I would gladly spend my weekends putting together an update, but I'm no longer going to actively pursue it. I've searched for that person who could tell me yeah or nay for over a year but he (or she) is not to be found."

Really sad after reading this. But also excited because the interest is back. This was written 7 years back and who would have thought things will change? Nobody! A game which started development work in 1995 is being discussed and played by loads of people across the globe in 2017. Matt Pritchard. You should be a proud man. I really hope you actually know about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> wow..thanks a lot for this.
And sigh, AoE Online was a complete failure. 

They intended it to have low hardware requirements

Nobody thinks lower hardware reqs nowadays, this was strange!

The game was eventually killed along with it

It was not! ;-)

So, the answer to "Anybody remotely associated to AoE from the original ES team right now?" is NO! </TEXT>

I really wonder if anybody from that original ES team still works for FE/AoE HD? Any idea? </TEXT>

<TITLE> NFS - Undercover in Windowed Mode (Steam)? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-01 08:13:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi All

First of all, a very happy new year to my fellow Racers!
I had a query regarding NFS Undercover. Is there a way I can play the game Windowed? I want to capture it on OBS. If the game goes Full Screen (as it is right now), the OBS captures a blank screen. Mind you, OBS successfully captures the cinematic part of the game. 

Any pointers? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hall of Fame Tournament Idea </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-28 10:45:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi All

Mostly, Hi to all 'Big' tournament Organizers out there, how about organizing a tournament (Talk to MS about this for funding, Zack?) on HD (Even Voobly is fine but then those players won't get to see new Civs and Architecture). Try to reach them, talk to them, interview them, and request them for one comeback.

This can be huge, it will create more interest in the game than ever, even fans of those players from early 2000s will come back, watch the tournament and get inspired to play. Obviously, mix the tournament with current top players. [MS gains? We gain?]

My choices - Koven, Halen, Jordan, Capoch, kkab, Chris, Grunt, Ruso, Iori, Viper, Riut, DauT, Tim, Yo, Slam....(Around 15 odd players)

Your thoughts?

Elephants came into existence in Africa too, but some years(centuries!) later..

At one time, African elephants inhabited the whole of the African continent. Now they are found only south of the Sahara, due to shrinking habitat and the effects of mans presence (namely the ivory trade).  </TEXT>

That said, we as spectators really suffered because of the Lags and the Restores. But we kept at it because the games were great and the stage was great.

Looking forward to more action today. ATB! </TEXT>

<TEXT> When they come up with something like this after years I really expect them to put in months of research before writing the first line of code. Talk to Asian historians even, if possible. AoE gamers love historic accuracy, and more you come up with stuff with only "wiki" level research, the more we feel that you are just trolling us and making money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guys,
When there are more than one streamer/caster uploading the same games, which one do you watch? Is over-lapping (same videos on multiple channels) videos annoying to you or do you find everybody's perspective interesting? 
But, still at the end of the day, you might only have time to watch one game only once, so which channel do you pick? Ex. Multiple channels have the Champions League games.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very difficult.
Boar has the exact same speed as Villager [0.8], so even with Loom it becomes very difficult to keep the villager alive in that long walk back to TC

Scout (1.2) and Eagle (1.1) finds it a relatively easier task to bring it back to your TC.

Above all, your villager is losing resource gathering time, so not worth it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> haha..exactly ...you wasted one day making people guess what the "game breaking" bug is! 

Since nobody in the history of the game (including the AI, including the time when Meta-Game was yet to be written) brought all the sheep below the TC at the same time, nobody ever encountered this "Bug"! </TEXT>

BacT did a 1v3 recently, I was simply lucky to witness it live.

2 Barracks/SWorkshop/Market/Blacksmith 

I think he was a 17xx player on Voobly (obviously not an expert).

Will upload another video where the opponent finds out he is doing this strat and walls his gold. That was a bit more fun!

<TEXT> Hi Guys,

How far do you wall when you play defensive or even mix-strategy games? Options below, add yours.
[Map - Arabia]

1) Initially make a compact wall with palisade and later in the game add stone walls ahead of it.

2) Wait for late Feudal and start stone walling, don't make any palisade walls.

3) Wall half the map [based on mini map learning] right away as you hit Feudal age. Few expert players play this game at times.

4) Only make short box/triangle walls throughout the game protecting villagers and resources.  </TEXT>

Spanish - If you take a few villagers forward and harass him to the point where you can go Castle without your base getting touched! </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, no, it's not a thing certainly.
But it's a conscious choice.

Reasons being, in a highly competitive game, when you are slinging possibly one player, you can sustain his army production with around 150 villagers. You would hardly (probably never) see an expert Slinger (Slam?) make 200 villagers [if he is not doing caravans]. 

Also, there are games, where you see the Slinger has stopped villager production, because he is slinging in a very competitive battle where if he stops due to food being consumed for his villager production, the slingee can lose the battle and that can decide the faith of the game. :-) </TEXT>

You can choose to Sling in Feudal Age or even Castle Age.
After a certain point, you stop producing villagers and just produce good economy to support your team-mate/s. Remember, you need to continuously sling, don't let any of your resources cross 300! </TEXT>

<TEXT> AoE 3 is more about exploring history, understanding those times and the entire feel of the game revolves around the time in which the civ actually existed.

AoE 2 is competition oriented, MP games make much more sense, it doesn't really give you a feel of history but every unique unit, every research has an amazing history behind it. Nothing is there just for the heck of it. 

Also, AoE2 has an amazing community! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Uno-Rage: Can you win a game with just one kind of Unit? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hello People, hope you are doing good.

Have you guys played a game with a human opponent [Maybe you have done it with the hard/hardest AI] with just one kind of mobile unit? 

We are playing a few games with this style, it is actually fun. 

1) If you have made one Archer, you ll have to make only Archer/Crossbow/Arbalest...you cannot make Castle Archer units, you cannot make Skirms. No siege is allowed. You need to beat the opponent [make him resign] with just Archers. Mind you he can't really make Skirms, he can't possibly win with only Skirms. Chu-ko-nus is the best bet to win with Archers I guess. Heavy Cavalry Archers?

2) Cavalry line [Only with Scout/Light Cav/Hussar], or [Only with Knight/Hussar/Pala]. Pala is the best bet, can't really win with Camels! Imperial Camels?

3) Only with Mango/Onagers/Siege Ona or only Scorpions/Heavy Scorps [Daut game anybody?] or maybe even only Trebs (katapur] with Japanese [Fun?]

4) Only with Castle units, only with Petards? :-)

I have played a few games with hard AI, it's a bit easy, but this will be a very difficult thing against human opponents. 

Why don't you guys try? Which Unit will you choose?

Note: The first scout is obviously not counted in this. You can make towers too but that is not considered as a Mobile Unit.

<TEXT> Not really sure what makes you so upset, not sure why you have taken it upon you to defend the entire Reddit Age of Empires kingdom, not letting it get touched by noobs (read Dirt), not letting it's image tarnished by noobs (read Dirt again).

Why do you think every tutorial should come from the greatest that ever was in the sport? There are people who can give tutorials even without playing the sport/game just by observation and sound knowledge. And nothing is written in gold! Nothing is mandatory. You don't need to follow or belief in what I say or anybody says. You don't have to defend anybody or the game, You are NOT Microsoft! You don't have to pass judgement on my quality of casting. If you don't like it, stay away from it. I am not holding gun on your head. And please don't represent this community or the game or Humanity!

<TEXT> Hi Drachen...

Really appreciate your watching the video and doing your homework. I didn't check exact ratings, I trusted the word of my 'friend' when claiming ELOs. 

As for advertising here and production quality - Nobody starts off with incredible work. The first game that Viper or Tatoh played in thr lives was surely not of 2.3K quality, people improve with time.
I am going to take your comment in a positive vein however harsh it is, and will try my best to improve on every aspect of my commentary. Word.

<TEXT> thanks for replying here too..(at Steam also)..

One way is to go fast Imp, but this is far more standard than Fast Imp. With this, its much easier to win a game as your opponent on the 20th min mark can't ever compete with you, with any civ! Unless Mirror.  </TEXT>
