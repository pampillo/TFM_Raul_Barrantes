<TEXT> I made this to practice for Mother's Day and I really like the way it came out. Cake is Bob's Red Mill gluten free yellow cake mix with an extra egg yolk and 1 tsp vanilla bean paste. The cream has 1 pint of strawberries, hulled and boiled down with 1/2 cup of white sugar. I simmered it on low for almost half an hour to boil off as much water as possible, then passed it through a strainer. I let that cool, then whipped it up with a cup and a half of heavy whipping cream.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am also an Akita owner and volunteered with the Akita rescue from which I adopted my dog. I have seen at least two VKH bears go through this rescue and both are living fulfilling lives with caring owners. I don't know specifics as far as cost of care, or what to expect moving forward, but do know these two are doing well. Yes, they are both fully blind, and one has completely lost all his pigment. Head over to /r/akitas, I remember seeing at least one redditor on there with a VKH bear. Best of luck to you both!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> R D. Not research and development, but Rob and Duplicate. Network with other sports teams of a similar size who do rely on sponsorship money and get copies of their MOUs/Sponsorship proposals/etc., to give you a good framework for where to start. Contact teams through social media in geographical areas outside your own. I did this for the last nonprofit I worked for when we were delving into sponsorships, and haven't had an ask to a similar organization in a different area go unanswered.

  In my experience, the biggest pitfall we encountered was setting our initial offerings too low, which screwed us out of extra income down the road. Sponsors who we had for several years refused to increase their sponsorship amount, even as our reach in the community grew. 

  In terms of approaching potential sponsors, research as much as you can. Find business owners with an affinity for your sport, start with your club players and ask them to throw out names/contact info of potential contacts and ask them to help you arrange in-person meetings. Look at businesses in the surrounding neighborhoods where you play, such as restaurants who could benefit from your players and fans visiting afterwards for a bite. Find incentives to offer your sponsors that won't cost you anything (such as social media mentions, logo placement on your team's website and the like). Treat each encounter like a business meeting, since sponsorship money often comes out of a businesses' marketing budget. Hope this gives you a good start! Best of luck!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Dad was a Filipino citizen turned American by way of the US Navy. In his 20s, he was a self-described fuck-up who was forbidden from seeing my mom due to his lack of future job prospects. As an ultimatum, my paternal grand parents made him take the ASBAV. He showed up to the test hung over after a huge bender. He scored top out of 400 and was able to enlist. 

  A few years pass and his ship is due to make port in the Philippines again. He visits my maternal grandparents, and they hardly recognize the polished young professional that he's become. Amazed at his transformation, they practically arrange my parents marriage in a 48 hour window of opportunity. (Don't worry, mom was happy about it!)

  A few months later, my mom is taking her first airplane trip in her life, alone, to meet my dad in the US. She's sitting next to an older white gentleman who is clearly hitting on her. "I'm going to meet my husband!" She says. Thinking that she was some sort of mail-order bride, he tells her "I'll wait until he shows up. If he decides he doesn't like you, I'll take you home with me."

  Even more years pass and my sister and I are born. Mom and Dad save enough money to bring Grandma over. I remember my mom and grandma studying hard, for several days, so they could pass the citizenship test, which they eventually did, making them official Americans. 

  After 16 years in the Navy, my Dad was able to retire, thanks to post-gulf war draw down. He secured a job as an engineer for a then small tech startup called Qualcomm. One of my fondest memories of my Dad was sitting by the computer, working on a technology report for my middle school computer class. He says "here, use this for your report", and shoves a thick technical manual at me. "It's what I'm working on right now." 

  The manual was all about Code Division Multiple Access, or CDMA. This lead to the beginning of 3G cellular service, and the development of the Qualcomm Snapdragon Processor, which also lead to Smart Phones. 

  Every once in a while after his career in the Navy, he would still drive down to 32nd Street Naval Base in San Diego and have a smoke down where the Carriers and Amphibs were docked. He'd tell me "Sometimes work is hard. But at least it's not as hard as the Navy. Be thankful for the Navy, kid." 

  God Bless the US Navy and all immigrants who have served or are currently serving in the US Armed Forces.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Spotting after vigorous workout? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-23 06:19:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Anyone else experience spotting after vigorous workouts since starting Keto?   

Began officially on Jan 2 after a few failed starts. I've been consistent keeping net carbs below 25g/day and have so far enjoyed almost a 14 pound weight loss. Yay!   

Saturday mornings I work out at a gym that focused on targeted heart rate training, with the goal of getting you to spend at least 15 total minutes working in the 85-90% zone over the course of a 55 minute workout. According to my heart rate monitor (which I know already overestimates this metric), I average a 550 cals burned per workout. However, each time I've come home from said workout, I've found some bleeding and experienced some mild cramping which carries in to the following day's evening, plus all the usual PMS symptoms, especially the general blah feeling.  I do 3-4 less intense workouts during the week which don't give me this problem. Just wondering if anyone else experiences something similar! Hoping this isn't a permanent thing. TIA!!!  ETA: no history of PCOS. I'm on Mirena IUD.

<TEXT> Ate at a significant deficit the last 7 days and was enjoying the initial water weight landslide on the scale. (Started Keto Dec 15, but had several setbacks. Didn't solidly find my footing until Jan 2.)

  Today, I had terrible insomnia (only 3 hrs.), shark week started, and I just had little to no energy (still trying to find the right mix for the potassium/magnesium/electrolytes thing). On top of that, I was given some bad news, which sent me into a chocolate binge. (Ate 8 of those damn Lindt dark chocolate truffles!).

  Now I'm lying in bed, feeling like absolute shit, knowing that I'll have to take several steps forward just to get back to where I was.  I take full responsibility for where I am, though. NYE 2017 will be the last time I ever resolve to lose weight, and Jan 10, 2017 will be the last time I lose control with food like that! Open to any and all advice on how to undo the damage!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're on Facebook, check out the Military Landlords group. Lots of good resources and support on that group including sample lease applications and agreements. Shoot me a message and I can help get you added.   

As for figuring out monthly rent, you'll want to look at comparable rental properties ("comps") in your area. Look at zillow or hotpads and search for similar sized residences in your area. For security deposit, 1 month's rent is standard. My current tenants had a so-so application so we asked them for 1.5 x monthly rent. In places where rentals are in high demand, I've seen 2 month's rent as standard as well.   

You also may want to look into using a property manager to handle all this. Cost is typically 10% of your monthly rental rate plus $500 or so for advertising your property. The benefit of having one is that he/she will handle all the research, application process, maintenance, etc on your behalf. I use one since my retail is on the opposite side of the country from our current duty station, so it will be really difficult for me to coordinate maintenance and the like. 
  
Best of luck in the Army!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not me, but a guy I knew had a Marine in his platoon who's sibling won the lottery. Being a good sibling s/he shared the wealth with said Marine. This Marine thought it a wise use of his funds to buy a car, (some kind of Lambo, I believe) only to later realize that the car did not meet the state's smog emission requirements, and therefore could not legally be driven on base to work. (At the time, you were required to have DoD decals on your vehicle, which required a smog test to obtain.) His elegant solution to this problem was to buy a 2nd car that he could drive on base, rent a parking spot from someone's house near the base, and drive the Lambo from his residence to his parking spot, and the 2nd car from the parking spot to his job site. Then do it all in reverse at the end of the day.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First post to this sub. Be gentle, por favor! 

Recipe: 

1 cup lukewarm water
1 envelope dry active yeast
3 TB sugar 
2 eggs, room temperature
3.75 cups AP flour (plus more for kneading)
1/4 cup milk powder
1 TB salt
4 TB unsalted butter, softened and cut into cubes
egg wash
Sesame seeds for top (optional) 

Mix sugar and water, add yeast and allow to bubble (5 mins), mix in eggs. 

In bowl of stand mixer, mix flour, milk powder and salt. Add butter, 1 cube at a time until incorporated. 

Add yeasty-egg mixture to dry ingredients. Mix on medium with dough hook until dough just starts to pull away from sides. Transfer dough to floured surface and knead into a ball. Oil a clean bowl, or spray it with nonstick. Allow dough to proof in greased bowl until doubled in volume (approx 40 mins). Punch dough down, shape into buns of your choice. (I used the kaiser roll method. Rolled them into 12 inch long x 1.25 inch wide ropes, and knotted them). Place on baking tray and allow to proof for another 30 mins. Brush with egg wash and top with sesame seeds. Bake in a 325 F oven for about 20 mins. Throw about 1/4 cup directly onto bottom of oven when you put them in and shut door. OR you can use a spray bottle to mist them at the beginning and halfway through. 

Came out with a nice light texture, perfect for tonight's dinner of pulled BBQ chicken (Chicken breasts + sweet baby ray's bbq sauce in a slow cooker. Shred after cooking on high for 4 hours), and tomorrow's dinner of Burgers. 

Next time I make this, I will probably use all milk instead of water and replace sugar with honey.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Family vacation to Hawaii with my mom, dad, younger brother and older sister. We're out on a nature walk with a tour group coming back from some sacred waterfall. Out of nowhere, my Dad just rips ass, and it's loud. Like the sound of a chainsaw roaring to life. To this day, about 10 years later, I feel so bad for the older couple that was walking right behind him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lazy me checking in. I just buy the boxed chocolate chip cookie mix. The kind that you just need to add one stick of butter and 1 egg to. I melt the butter instead of soften it, and mix it with 1 cup old fashioned oats. I let that sit for 10 mins then add the egg, cookie mix, about 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup flax seed, 2-3 table spoons Brewers yeast and just enough water to bring it all together.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Had the same deep crack when LO was around 2 weeks. His pediatrician recommended applying a mix of 50% Desitin (really any diaper rash cream with zinc oxide) and 50% bacitracin ointment (found in the first aide aisle next to the neosporin). I used this after each feed and wore breast shields (the big ones that keep your clothing from touching your nipple, not the ones for feeding) to let the crack air dry. Blisters healed up nicely and we're still going strong at 7 weeks.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> (recipe) Cheddar Lactation Biscuits </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Recipe for "Lactation Biscuits" that I made...for when you can't eat another lactation cookie! Let me know what y'all think! 

Ingredients: 
1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup old fashioned oats
1/4 cup flax seed
3-4 Tb Brewers Yeast
2 Tb dried parsley (optional)
1/2 tsp old bay seasoning (optional)
1/2 tsp Salt
1 Tb garlic powder

1 stick butter (cold-- cut into cubes)
4 ounces extra sharp cheddar (use more if you like it cheesy!)
1 egg
1/4 -1/2 cup cold water or milk

Directions:
Combine the dry ingredients in a food processor. Pulse until well combined and oats are almost pulverized. Add cold butter and cheese, and pulse until dough resembles wet sand. Beat egg with 1/4 cup water until well combined. While food processor is running, slowly add egg/water mixture. Add more water as necessary to get dough to combine until just sticky. Drop by the spoon full onto a greased cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes, depending on size of biscuits.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm right there with you! 14 days pp, and DH is only home on the weekends for this month due to a mandatory job training that's only offered once every other year. Least he can do is take the 3rd diaper change during the night shift, but noooo... He's in bed next to me, kTFO'd.

Also, during my emergency c-section, I complained to DH, and the entire surgical staff present "Next time, we're just getting a puppy!"  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rant: Saw a lactation consultant today </TITLE>

<TEXT> "You caused your baby to lose all his nursing instincts." 

Saw an LC today with my 2 week old. I wanted someone to evaluate my technique and help me out with his painful latch, as well as hopefully get a good pep talk. Lack of sleep from new baby, combined with some possible PPD, and marathon cluster feelings has made formula look oh so tempting as of late.

She asked me to get him on the breast, and I used the technique that was taught to me by a different LC at the hospital: football hold, and using free hand to feed the nipple to his wide open mouth. LO was more than happy to go to town on the boob juice. She immediately wanted me to unlatch him and use the cradle hold to try and get him to self latch. Baby was upset about the interrupted feeding and didn't know quite what to do. He wasn't feeling around for my breast or bobbing his head up and down to try and latch. That's when she said it. "You caused your baby to lose all his nursing instinct." She also told me I'm doing baby a disservice by using nipple cream and my medela gel pads. She said I need to stop using them immediately to get my nipples desensitized to baby's feeding. Anyone else been told this? 

I'm sorry! Had I known what to do I wouldn't have booked a lactation consultant! Last thing I needed was to be made to feel inadequate. Ugh! Just needed to rant about this visit. Worst of all, baby still has an uncomfortable latch, and I'm out $100 for this consultation because insurance won't cover it. Need some motivation to keep going here, because in seriously starting to burn out! 

Edit: Thanks everyone for the comments and support! Before LO was born, I was able to easily express a few table spoons of colostrum no problem so I had the false confidence that BFing would come naturally. However, after he was born via emergency c-section, my colostrum supply dried up after the first 3 feedings and I was forced into supplementing with formula (By SO and Mom, at the suggestion of our pediatrician after baby lost nearly 15% of his initial birth weight) before leaving the hospital. Milk took 5 days to come in which added even more stress. Once the leche started flowing, we had a good few days before I started blistering and bleeding. It got to the point where I dreaded feeding time which is why I went to go see a consultant. Happy to have confirmation that the particular one I saw was probably just an idiot.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should I keep my car or trade it in when purchasing our next? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-28 01:05:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First time poster, long time lurker. Husband and I currently own 3 cars: Jeep Wrangler ('12), Scion TC ('08) and Camry ('02). All but one (Jeep) is PIF. Trying to weigh the pros and cons between keeping my Scion and getting rid of the Camry or keeping the Camry and trading in the Scion. 

We're expecting our first bundle of joy in December and are planning to get rid of one of our two cars and purchase a new vehicle more suitable for the kiddo. However, since we're also scheduled to make a cross country move sometime June/July 2016, we're postponing the purchase of our new car until after that move is completed. Our loan on the jeep is scheduled to be paid off by September '16, but in order to avoid having two car payments at once, we plan to pay it off after getting our tax return approx March/April of next year. 

Husband currently uses his Camry to commute (45mi/day RT) 5 days a week. However, his job also often requires him to drive during working hours, putting another 100-200 additional miles per week on top of his commute. His car currently has 250,000+ miles and zero trade in value, and has gone 3 cross country moves. We anticipate this driving estimate to remain approx about the same when we move in June/July '16. I currently use the scion (currently 100K mileage, est. 4.5K trade in value) to commute. However, due to impending doom (of both Kiddo's arrival and our move cross country), my boss and I have already negotiated a part time, work from home agreement for me after Kiddo is born. Due to this, husband and I have decided that it makes the most sense for me to drive the Jeep for work/errands when needed after kiddo is born. (I don't anticipate driving more than 2 days/week for work) I should also mention that having a beater car (whether it be the Camry or the Scion) is a non-negotiable for husband, as he wants to keep his road princess (Jeep) safe in the garage as much as possible. Our new car will be in the 24-28K price range, and barring something catastrophic, we plan to have an 8-10K down payment. (7.5K already in the bank-- this is exclusive of any emergency/retirement funds we currently have. Anticipated OOP moving costs also being accounted for.)

Given all that background info, my instinct is telling me that before the end of the year, we would be better off donating the Camry and getting a tax write off and keeping my car (Scion) for husband to use for his daily commute. The primary reason being that, even though the scion would get better trade in value when it's time to buy the new car, by keeping it, we would save much more over the maintenance of keeping the Camry. (Since one way or another, he insists on having a beater car) Husband wants to do the opposite and keep his Camry, based on the fact that we could get more trade-in value for my car. PersonalFinance, what would you do? Thanks for your input in advance! 

Tl;dr - Need to get a new car for our expanding family in June/July '16 after moving cross country. Should I keep 2008 scion tc and donate 2002 Camry for tax write off, or trade in Scion and keep Camry as a beater car?  </TEXT>
