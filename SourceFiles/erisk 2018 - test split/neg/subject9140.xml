<TEXT> $75k for a housekeeper and $100k for a chef! Someone's getting ripped off!!

When I sold my house I had 2 housekeepers come by on a Sunday and they cleaned my *entire* house for $300. I could eat off the floor in my garage when they were done!

And average salary for an executive chef is $75k (thank you, Google.)

Apparently rich = stupid according to this article. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dinoland USA feels that way because it wasn't the original plan for that area. It was originally supposed to be mythical beasts but they scrapped it to tie into the movie Dinosaur (which was in production at the time.)

Basically, Dinoland USA is Disney's equivalent of losing their homework and trying to recreate the assignment before the teacher walks into homeroom.

A movie-centric attraction to every land in Epcot that doesn't have one. For example, remove Impressions Of France and put in a show or movie related to any of the myriad Disney movies with French roots.

Retire:

The Speedway by Space Mountain. The ride is showing its age and there is enough room in that location to add something that will excite guests.

Improve:

The ridiculousness of trying to eat at Cinderella's Royal table. I should not need to plan meals months in advance for the privilege of eating $50 eggs.

<TEXT> You received *A LOT* of heavy handed answers but truth be told, it's more fun to root for the bad guy.

Whether it's because you enjoy the idea of  unchecked power, doing what you want or believe that the good guys are lame and predictable, the villain is always more interesting/dynamic.

Darth Vader, from the minute he steps on the screen, takes over. Even in Rogue One, his 90 seconds of light saber attacks are the highlight of the movie.

Luke is introduced as a farm boy and Obi Wan as a drifter in the desert. 

People to this day like Han because he "shot first." Like a villain, he didn't play by the rules.

The Villain is more enjoyable to watch, plain and simple. </TEXT>

Her parents were wealthy. That doesn't make her talented, intelligent or qualified to do anything.

I'm not saying she isn't *potentially* all of those things as I don't know her, but let's all be honest with ourselves: she's a rich kid that probably never had to work much for what she wanted.

<TEXT> So companies can raise money without issuing more debt. Or more simply, they can raise money without being legally required to pay someone back (which is how debt/loans/bonds work).

In exchange for you buying stock, you have ownership in that company...albeit a *VERRRRY* small percentage.  That's why owning a stock is called "having equity in a company."

As an equity owner, if the company goes out of business, it's basically "sucks for you" because you're an owner now.

Net-net: companies need money and people that buy stock give it to them in exchange to be part owner of the same company. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a person that lives in Philadelphia (the actual city, not the burbs) and did not always, allow me to give some insight on this issue:

Most would agree Schools, teacher salaries etc are typically funded by real estate taxes

Philadelphia is *legendarily* bad at collecting real estates taxes

Example: https://www.google.com/amp/www.phillymag.com/news/2015/04/15/paying-taxes-philadelphia-optional/%3Famp%3D1

Further, property values are either depressed or undervalued I.E. what taxes are received are far below what receipts should be

As a result, because nothing is paid in, nothing is paid out IE teachers get nothing because money still doesn't grow on trees.

Philadelphia as a city is WOEFULLY mismanaged from a fiscal perspective. Additionally, if you want to see the long term impact of one political party running everything, then look no further:

https://www.google.com/amp/www.phillymag.com/news/2016/11/19/donald-trump-philadelphia-democratic-party/%3Famp%3D1

I'm originally from NJ and the thing I say to everyone in Philly is, "In NJ we all know there is government corruption, but at least *we get something out of it.* In Philadelphia, no one is getting anything."

IMO, This is the high point in the Resident Evil series 

Additionally, the Wii controls are vastly superior to the standard RE tank controls that can make it a frustrating console game.

**Bioshock**

A very original FPS with probably the best storyline of any game in its genre.

Bioshock 2 and Infinite are also great, but this game is an all time classic.

<TEXT> And that's exactly the reason why Philosophy is considered a joke major in colleges: the belief that it's value is in opining on the unknowable to come to a specious conclusion simply because *logically* it makes sense.

I'm not saying it isn't interesting to discuss those topics, but one of the points of this article is for philosophers to show *meaningful progress* to questions around which *a consensus* is being built.

We who love philosophy can circle jerk all day about the intangibles of existence, but until we provide *actual* value to a conversation people care about, and stop trying to turn every disagreement into an elenchus/teaching opportunity, the entire concept of philosophy will remain either too abstract, or worse a joke, to an every day person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not saying a person can't abandon a belief system.

I'm saying me *trying to convince someone* to abandon their belief system **and succeeding** is unlikely as it is construed as an attack on their faith.

I know many people that have become more secular as they've aged, but I don't know a single one that ever said, "People making me constantly question my faith is why I became more secular"

It's usually something that just evolved out of personal experience.

I guess what I'm saying is, I would consider it unlikely that a person would change their beliefs strictly based upon a priori knowledge and theoretical discussion (as opposed to knowledge gleaned from life) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm by no means against teaching epistemology, *but* many of the challenges in our current political climate arise from secular vs. religious approaches.

No amount of discussion on epistemology is going to convert a person's belief system if that belief system is based on faith.

Net-net: I agree with your point in that epistemology is important, but that's probably only because I consider my own points of view to be justifiable.

<TEXT> As a person that majored in Philosophy in college I wholeheartedly agree with this.

Even on Reddit, most of the Philosophy threads I see make the front page are stuck up posts that have *zero* bearing on modern life.

In our current times, ethical and political philosophy are the only "useful" areas of thought and should be frequently discussed.

If the people that *actually know* philosophy are sitting around debating topics like metaphysics, then *it is* our fault that philosophy is disappearing because we're essentially jerking ourselves off, saying "I'm so smart", and providing no direction toward **worthwhile** discourse for a regular person.

TL;DR -

Aristotle (ex.metaphysics), Hobbes, Locke, Mill, Kant - Yes

Descartes, Heidegger (Nazi), Wittgenstein - No </TEXT>

Easiest way in my opinion:

1) stare straight ahead 

2) very short answers

3) don't ask them the same question 

E.g. If they ask your plans for the weekend.

You: "not sure"

DO NOT ASK THEIR PLANS. IT'S A PLOY FOR A CONVERSATION. NOT SURE GIVES THEM NOTHING TO WORK WITH AT ALL.

After two or three of those, they get the hint.

<TEXT> The fallout of the civil war has never been fully resolved.

Despite emancipation in 1865, laws were in place for a full century that kept whites and blacks "separate, but equal"

Even now the disenfranchisement of African Americans is a goal of one party in the United States to keep this the case.

The racial challenges the rest of the world sees today are due to structural forces that keep minorities, and especially African Americans, at a disadvantage.

Homogeneity is such a given in so many countries, I feel like this would be hard to understand.

<TEXT> To explain like you're 5, people on Wall Street primarily;

Help raise money for new(er) companies (investment banking)

Help existing companies increase value for all owners, including the regular person, in secondary market (the stock market as most people know it)

Help you manage your money (wealth management and financial advice)

Help entities/individuals/states/counties manage risk and exposure (derivatives and synthetic products)

Help entities/states/countries raise money they need in exchange for future payments to those that loaned them money (fixed income and debt issuances)

Help provide liquidity to banks that want to make loans to regular people (The Fed and institutional lending)

Insure the money of bank deposits and brokerage accounts (FDIC and SIPC)

Oversee financial firms to ensure they don't screw over customers and comply with law (SEC, FINRA, OCC, FSA etc)

Make it possible for financial transactions to be completed or "settle" (DTC, NSCC, Euroclear, CREST, etc)

Move money around the globe (Fed Wires, ACH etc. Most Wall Street firms are banks as well)

What'll we do!?

Update: we've known this fact for over a fucking year and no one who likes him cares.

Until we get a POV video of:

President Shitgibbon directing 2 Russian escorts 

To piss on each other in a bed at The Four Seasons in Moscow

And then saying "Yeah, piss on that bed Obama slept in. I don't care if he produced his long form birth certificate"

And then turning the camera to his face and saying "I'm Donald Trump and I approved this message because that's what I think of Democracy"

No one other than his critics will care.

Pardon me while I go get drunk and unpack the truth in that very depressing statement.

<TEXT> Easy killer. Let's start with your last comment. I have no problem with anyone from foreign countries, including Ivana. That said.

It may interest you to know that Ivana Trump had a previous marriage of convenience to get out of her Communist homeland (link 1).

Second, it may interest you to know, that Melania Trump was most likely an illegal immigrant to US in her early modeling days (link 2).

Third, given Trump's blatant issues with immigrants from other countries, unlike myself, I'm forced to mock the inherent hypocrisy of his fondness for immigrant brides from Eastern Europe when juxtaposed with his flagrantly anti immigrant policies.  The most ridiculous way to do so is claim they are mail order brides (as Eastern Europe is known for that since the fall of communism). (Link 3). It is not an attack on his wives, but an attack on him and his policies.

Now that I've explained my joke, a typical no-no, **back the fuck off.**

This may sound stupid, but use the appropriate heat on the stovetop burners. So many people burn/over cook food for this simple reason.

If the recipe calls for medium heat, then use medium heat. Cooking your omelets with the dial turned to 10 isn't the answer! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The entire idea of Holocaust Denial is based on the logical fallacy of "shifting the burden of proof".

If I say Mother Theresa was secretly a crackhead, international arms dealer, and you say she wasn't, then the burden of proof isn't on *you*

By entertaining the ideas of morons we falsely equate all ideas as being equal. Trying to prove a Holocaust denier wrong takes the position that their idea needs to be proved wrong, and it doesn't.

Sometimes we need a little less diplomacy and a little more Buzz Aldrin.

<TEXT> If I Had A Million Dollars by Barenaked Ladies

The lyrics sound utterly ridiculous and sappy as the singer lists all of the outrageous things he'd buy his love.

BUT, the end of every verse before the chorus is the line "If I had a million dollars, I'd buy your love."

The singer has someone they love, but that love is unrequited (and they believe only by being rich will things change, hence the final line of the song)

It sounds like such an upbeat song but is one of the most depressing songs I know (That's my interpretation anyway) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exaggerated pain.

My German shepherd stepped on a nail when she was a puppy (after digging through my carpet.) She made that high pitched yelp that dogs in pain make, which of course made me freak out (especially when I saw the aftermath).

Since then, any time she experiences even mild discomfort she will yelp the same way because she knows I react.

Scratches *herself* too hard - yelp

Make her stop pulling on leash in park - yelp

Brush against her when opening door - yelp

It's crazy!

TL;DR : My German shepherd is emotionally manipulative! </TEXT>

2) Sitting in coach despite item 1 (the real version of that bag is worth a 1st class seat)

3). The dog is not in a carrier I.e. The woman paid for her dog to have a seat

4) (and I'm assuming) this is a "comfort animal" which is **bullshit.** You're saying your worry about (fill in the blank) is more important than people who are physically allergic to animals. Additionally, comfort animals are bullshit in general. I have a medical condition that would permit me to bring my 95 pound German shepherd on a plane, but I don't. You know why, because I'm not a selfish asshole. If I want to fly, then I need to live with what that entails. </TEXT>

And have WAAAY better health benefits than I do

<TEXT> While I appreciate you larger point, you are missing mine.

Since you've done these types of studies you're better equipped to tell me:
1) how often are women raping men (not children, grown men)
2) in those cases how does sentencing compare to men (I'm sure there are many more cases of men vs. women (or men), but there should be some
3) when compared to other crimes, how does rape sentencing typically play out E.g. Is it analogous to manslaughter, car theft or something else.

Again, you've done the studies so you're better equipped to know, but rape should definitely have a more severe punishment than 8 years in jail IMO (I cheated and grabbed a quick link for that number.)

Carjacking carries ten to fifteen years in prison in some cases (again, quick link)

If someone can honestly tell me that possibly being dragged out of your car and having it stolen, is worse than rape, then I'd be very surprised. </TEXT>

-By posting this comment you are admitting you have no idea what to do with the money (that's a good thing because you realize it)

Investment managers, specifically those that act as a fiduciary for a trust (because they are legally required to act in your wife's best interest) are more adept at managing this situation than you are.

Those managers will most likely expect a % of assets they manage each year in fees; however, that should be deducted from returns i.e. Ideally your wife makes money every year. </TEXT>

In 2014 the military published their own findings on the makeup of the military (see link below).  At that time more than half the US military was under 30 years of age.  This shouldn't surprise anyone because there are more rank and file soldiers than officers...like any company

As per food service, the millennials are the largest generation in our nation's history, overtaking baby boomers (link 2).  This may pain millennials to hear but they are still young and don't have that much to offer employers at the bottom end of the age group. When you're young you take shit jobs to get by (I worked at Borders Books for example...remember them?)

No millennial should read this study as anything more than:

The youngest people are in the two roles that historically have been filled by the youngest people in American society (excluding possibly during WW1, WW2 and Vietnam).

As soon as you say "Fuck you God" in a song, you may as well shoot a puppy on live TV because the sponsors will avoid you like the plague.

The bunk falls on him and the girl below us, throwing me and the Girl on top to the floor.  I run through the quad's shared bathroom to the next room to grab my roommates for help.

I then *interrupt* one of them having sex with their girlfriend (not under the covers.). Me being drunk, and having just seen two unexpectedly naked bodies, stutter our friend is dead and we need help.

He gets dressed, we run to first room together to lift the bunk off our friend and the girl, somehow they're fine and just laughing..:no idea how to this day.

Reporter says: We said food stamp fraud was $70MM in 2016

Correction: From 2009 to 2011 it was actually $853MM for each of those 3 years. Nationally, food stamp trafficking is on decline. We're sorry about that

Ummm...$853MM is **WAY MORE** than just the $70MM originally cited, though I understand it's a different time period.

Irrespective of your thoughts on food stamp fraud, I would expect this data to have been presented as: 

"BREAKING NEWS: FOOD STAMP FRAUD WAY WORSE THAN ORIGINALLY REPORTED"

which is not how they've offered this correction.

<TEXT> Good points of differentiation. Also worth noting is that they looked a college aged couples. 

Thus I read the findings as "partner wealth" = "partner family income" because, let's be honest, very few college aged males are earning so much money that they statistically differentiate themselves from each other with any real dispersion.

However, the benefits of rich parents is highly correlated with rich children.  As a result, if a college aged girl is dating a college aged guy with rich parents, it is logically fair to assume that his parents' wealth is perceived as his wealth. </TEXT>

If a performer, while performing said, X person is sexually harassing me, then I don't see how that doesn't constitute sexual harassment (even if the performer immediately says, "I was just improvising")

I read a news story in the NY Post a few months ago about a couple of female performers accusing a male performer of raping them on set while filming.  Now rape and sexual harassment are obviously different crimes but the existence of the more severe crime makes me believe the lesser crime certainly exists, and that laws have to exist to control for it BUT how do they? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nintendo 64: All Star Baseball 2001

In season mode, on the hardest difficulty, I:

Played a perfect, undefeated season 

Closed out the World Series with a perfect game and over 100 runs scored

The tricks to doing so:

**Batting:** 

The batting reticle ( a 3D square within a square) appeared to encourage batters to get a bullseye to get better hits.  This was wrong and misled players.

You could crush home runs repeatedly by aligning the reticle so that the pitch crossed the plate at the very top of the outside square and then swinging.  I would expect this to result only pop-flys but instead it sent pitches over the wall with *a lot* of frequency.

**Pitching**

While batters had a box of "hot and cold" zones, the real trick was to keep it random.  If you threw 3 fastballs in a row at the cold zone the batter would catch on pretty much every time.

This was closer to the mindset of actually pitching and trying to outsmart a batter.  That said, pitchers with 6-12 curveballs, cutters or sliders could get up to two strikes with ease on almost every batter. From there it was painting the corners. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LMAO yes I understand harassment as well as the general rules and regs of HR law.  Additionally,  I have a pretty good handle of what is required to pass the litmus test I.e. At what point is something defined as sexual harassment.

That said, I'm presuming acting in adult films, much like acting in Hollywood films, has a certain amount of improvisation. I understand there is advanced planning (so to speak) but defining said improvisation as sexual harassment would be a challenge I would think (not that it doesn't happen, but how to make your case is more difficult than in your typical corporate setting)

Further, I would think most adult performers are not employees of the companies making movies but rather independent contractors, meaning they aren't exactly attending an employee orientation and given a handbook on "appropriate workplace interactions."

I'm sure There is also isn't a formal warning process when these contractors initially break those rules to correct the action.

<TEXT> Just because they are targeted to audiences you are not a part of does not mean it is racist/classist/anything else to make you pay for them as part of the content distributor bundling strategy.

Think of it this way, the goal of any company is to maximize revenue and profits.

Let's say you only want to pay for ESPN and it costs the content distributor $10 to produce that content but they (cable companies really as they pass through the cost) charge you $12.  They've made $2, or 20%, on their original investment.

BUT they know *everyone* wants ESPN and they also have the fishing network which they are producing content for and need to sell.  That content costs them $1.  The charge to you may be $2; however, that's a 100% markup on that content (albeit still way cheaper than ESPN to you)

The net effect is their return is increased by over 7% to 27.25% because they forced you to take content most people wouldn't pay for and your bill went up 16% as a result.

While this situation definitely sucks, what this example is meant to illustrate is that, irrespective of what motive you think there is for bundling:

The only motive ever is profit

The only color that matters is green  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part of studying to be a CFA does entail reviewing financial statements but most CFAs that I know are some type of portfolio manager (and they aren't reviewing financial statements all day)

Large Investment firms have analysts that review, research public companies and sit on calls when earnings come out but I don't have a sense of how many investment analysts exist in that regard.  

You're right about product mgmt. but in a very high level sense.  If you wanted to be a product manager in technology usually that entails manages customer and executive expectations, working with tech developers and meeting with users to gather their input/requirements.  There are other types of product managers as well but I focused on tech since you originally mentioned it.

That said, none of those certifications I mentioned originally will necessarily get you a job as a product manager if you don't already have experience doing that job.  They would be a bonus, not a requirement to be hired (in most cases, at least) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This will never happen and it's not because of the cable companies in most cases.

Content distributors mandate that if cable companies want to carry X channel, then you also need to carry I.e. Pay us, to carry these other 10 channels. This is the source of the bundle forced on the consumer.

Now that doesn't mean companies like comcast are innocent, they are after all a content distributor. However, take a content distributor like YES Network   (20th century Fox is majority owner) whose carriage agreements mandate other channels with low viewership must be sold as well, and you can see why Comcast dropped them in 2016.

<TEXT> I was waiting for someone to say that I.e.  "we had so   many colonies"...which makes sense but certainly does nothing for the ol' America ego!

World War 1 we are taught a lot about actually (or a fair amount.). The Franco-Prussian empire, assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, secret alliances etc are covered.  They really focus on the post Lusitania war activities but we do learn about the run up.

WW2 is a totally different story.  While we are *very* educated about the rise of Nazi Germany, the US school system glosses over the Japanese side of the story.  

As I've gotten older, I've come to the conclusion this is intentional simply because then it fits the narrative of Pearl Harbor being an "out of the blue" attack.  The overwhelming majority of Americans have no knowledge of The Nanking Massacre or other Japanese aggression that ultimately led to our Oil and Scrap Metal Embargoes of Japan or that we closed off the Panama Canal to them, greatly impacting their economy.

Japan and US were very much at odds leading up to Pearl Harbor but to say the surprise attack was truly a "surprise" feels a little disingenuous. However, to teach that in school would mean America has to tacitly accept responsibility for the fact that Japan's declaration of war was motivated by our own actions (even though our actions were well intended and meant to stop them from committing acts of further aggression) </TEXT>

America was all about "no kings! Throw off the yolk of the king!" and King John being forced to sign the Magna Carta by men that broke into his home, plays nicely into the American narrative about the "common" man beating the monarchy.

England, as far as I am aware, still takes pride in their monarchy (and I don't think the Monarchy would look to kindly on that time the king was forced to do something!)

(If any of my understanding of Magna Carta, and how it came to be signed is wrong, then blame American textbooks for their description of events) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on what they do.

There are a lot of people with jobs in this industry that have zero exposure to the markets, regulators, etc.  In that case you are 100% right.

There are also people that ascribe to different schools of economic thought i.e. what actions best produce the best macroeconomic/microeconomic results.  In this case you're not wrong, but it's more in line with your comment about rolling the dice.  The global economy is far too complex to say "taking A action will cause B result every time" (barring insane scenarios like replacing your fiat currency with an economy based on bartering Reddit Karma...that will always cause a market crash lol)

While that leads to disagreement, at least it's informed disagreement.

<TEXT> When you think about spying in America you have to start with Nathan Hale, a person that in all likelihood was well known even 100 years afters his death.

Hale holds the dubious distinction of being the first US spy executed. Within the article below is a list of "official rules for spying" compiled by a museum about the Cold War.

If we apply those rules retroactively to the Civil War, we can see that the likelihood of effective spycraft is reduced because of rule 2: Don't Attract Attention, Blend In. (First link below)

While we were one country, Northerners and Southerners were disparate enough groups of people that blending would have proved challenging, despite sharing a similar language (see second link below).

Lastly, just to state the obvious, even if spies were widely used, their names might never be known nor what they did. (Kind of defeats the purpose of being a spy and puts the spy's life in future jeopardy)

Never applied myself at all and was actually embarrassed by a professor in front of entire department and all families at my college graduation.

Took a shit job out of college (payroll at a law firm) and, after a year of that pursued a career in banking and investments.

Was still a fuck up and almost got fired twice.

When I finally got married I decided to apply myself and now I'm the management level below the C suite at a wealth management firm.

Even if you put aside the religious aspects of this event, you can conclude that the "battle by champion" portion of the story is not *fanciful*.

<TEXT> It's also not so scary when you realize the director, Tobe Hooper, said

"In a way I thought the heart of the film was about meat; its about the chain of life and killing sentient beings."

i.e. there's arguments to be made that it's really about the benefits of vegetarianism.

<TEXT> Hardwell - Spaceman (Headhunterz remix) into PPK - ResuRection

The Headhunterz remix gradually gets harder/speeds up until the last 10 seconds when it falls off the table and basically flatlines.

ResuRection starts with an isolated, delayed synth and builds back up into a heavy trance song over first few minutes.  (There are also a number of remixes of this including one by Paul Oakenfold). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps encyclopedia brittanica is more to your liking (see below)

Also, just because "Badass of the week" cites Timur, doesn't invalidate the actual historical conqueror.   

And that wasn't even remotely a bait and switch. If it turned out Timur was actually a vegan painter that lived in Temecula, CA and drove a Tesla, then that would be a bait and switch.  

I laid out a number of known historical facts

I intentionally omitted further facts to ensure my point was not misunderstood

I included two bits of trivia and cited them as things **not considered genuine** (the very definition of Apocryphal). 

History is littered with examples of this: 

the Gordian knot and Alexander of Macedon

The cherry tree and George Washington

King tut and his tomb

None of these bits of apocrypha make history any less Interesting or true.  They are *minor* facets of a much larger story BUT are nonetheless interesting. Which in turn makes some (like me) research why they came to exist at all. Perhaps the OPs friends will feel the same.

<TEXT> I'm calling them Apocryphal only because I can't easily cite a source, but I learned them in my own college history classes.

Rather than represent those stories as fact, I wanted the OP to know I couldn't vouch for their veracity. 

And, just to state the obvious, I don't honestly believe there was a curse on Timur's tomb that led to World War II; however, that doesn't mean the OP's friends won't find this piece of information interesting (which was his original goal, to make it interesting.)

Truth be told, I actually **omitted** a fair amount of historically accurate info about Timur because I didn't want the OPs post to turn into a flame war about modern terrorism and religious extremism. I just wanted to give a response that might drive OP's friends to dig a little deeper.

<TEXT> So I don't see any posts that actually answer OPs question: why suspend a kid from school.

Answer:

There was once a time when kids were actually left back a grade or expelled.

Suspensions were events that either preceded those events or, ultimately, led to them. 

Nowadays that rarely happens and kids are essentially passed to a new grade/school to be "some other teacher's problem"

Hence, while today an out of school suspension amounts to giving a kid vacation days, the original intended purpose was a precursor to a much more severe punishment intended to ensure the child behaved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fahrenheit 451 is definitely the better book *but* be forewarned there is an "official" explanation and it's not the one they usually teach I.e. 

If you stick to the censorship interpretation, and she's knows the below, then you might get a poor grade

If you give the "official" interpretation, and she doesn't know it, then you might get a poor grade

Does it need to be controversial philosophy? If you want to be a suck-up you could always read "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance".  It's Eastern Philosophy told through a novel and most philosophy professors I had loved it.

Edit: Also, if you have any actual interest in egoism, start with Aristotle and work your way forward in time. 

Thinking you understand egoism, because you read Ayn Rand, is like thinking you know Star Wars because you saw Episode II.

1) Lived 100 years after Ghenghis Khan and subjugated 3/4 of his kingdom

2) estimated to have killed 5% of the *global* population with armies

3) Known for building towers/pyramids using the bodies/skulls of conquered enemies

4) Made no exception for women or children

5) Apocryphal story exists that if his tomb was disturbed it would bring about the end times.  Hitler visited 2 days after his tomb was disturbed. When Timur's remains were returned, the Russians beat back the Germans in Stalingrad very shortly after (again, apocryphal)

6) Apocryphal story exists about marching prisoners into a chasm until their corpses were piled high enough for his army to cross (again, *very* Apocryphal)

I'd link to Wikipedia but not always reputable.  That said, Timur definitely has a *very long* wiki entry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm missing the part where you refute my point about the United States being successfully invaded.

Capture/attack of merchant vessels does not equal continental subjugation and loss of national identity/forced assimilation and loss of our language.

Barbary pirates in the 18th century were no more invading America than Somali pirates are today. Case in point, the attacks you cite occurred in the Mediterranean (not exactly an imminent threat to our sovereignty).

The difference between conquest and thievery is like the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing one.

<TEXT> Not to shit on other states but many of the "pointless" states (as you put it) are sparsely populated compared to those on the coasts.

For example, the entire state of Wyoming has half as many people as the 6 largest counties in New Jersey **individually, not combined" I.e. Simply by population, 6 of NJs counties are justifiably their own states (which plays into your other point.)

While I agree it seems ridiculous in some ways, I think the alternative (numerous small countries) would be worse and the contiguous US would face the kinds of challenges European nations face I.e. Hating all your neighbors and going to war with them when you finally feel justified or they attack an allied nation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone that works in investment management, I'm going to turn this into an ELI5.

Bernie Madoff promised his investors the same performance as stated above: **10% to 12% in annual returns**

Madoff Securities was a ponzi scheme and he stole $20 Billion.

It is **against the law* to promise a specific level of investment returns and that is why you will hear/see the phrase "past performance is not indicative of future results" in **all** advertisements. For example, at the bottom of every page of the SEC filing below.

Now For the ELI50:
Calculation of investment performance can be *very* complex. 

Are your returns asset or time weighted? 

Are you using a geometric or arithmetic mean return? 

Is your performance being impacted because you're harvesting tax losses?

There are just some of the basic things to consider. If you really want to plan for future, then I would perform the research yourself instead of listening to "financial gurus" (Suze Orman is another one that comes to mind.) We live in the age of data and it's never been easier to spend an afternoon learning what you really need to know.

<TEXT> I was going to say a wiseass response to this, but then it dawned on me, I think there is actually a correct answer: condoms

While not technically food, heroin mules have been ingesting large quantities of drugs for years i.e. there is historical precedent for condoms being consumed even if they don't provide nutritional value (but then again, neither do pixie sticks).

If drugtraffickers can "safely" consume (and pass) heroin that way, then I think the Saw VIII victim that you describe above could conceivably beat the torture trap without having to actually eat shit and potentially contract god knows what diseases. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a gross oversimplification of a much more substantial economic policy. See below

1) First the US Govt gives tax breaks/incentives to corporations (with good lobbyists)

2) Then they give tax cuts to those in the highest tax brackets

Thus, the companies have higher earnings and pay lower taxes.

This makes the executives (1%ers) look good, who get paid more for better than expected company performance

In turn those same executives are taxed at a lower personal rate on their performance based pay (or taxed at lower rates in end around ways that regular people don't understand like ordinary vs. interest income)

So the government both loses tax revenue to the corporations *and* the individuals running them. But that's okay, because everyone in Congress will get jobs at those same companies when they are finally voted out of office. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure I'm following your comments.

Your second comment re: tax incentives and cheap labor, sounds like it is critical of the practice of globalization i.e. tax incentives to keep companies here are better than companies moving jobs overseas

Your third comment re: Companies playing states against each other, sounds like you are defending the practice of shipping jobs wherever a company gets the best deal. In this case it would be accomplished by exploiting the best state tax scenario (Most likely incentives).

If I'm understanding you correctly, then it sounds like you're okay with companies exploiting incentives to lower costs, but only under the condition whereby the company maintains its domestic presence.

This doesn't make sense to me because:

-Companies moving jobs between states still results in people losing jobs. National unemployment may not rise but people in State A still lose jobs people in State B.  This is very much an argument for the right of the company to do what it needs to operate

-However, your second point appears to state a company does not have the right to operate by taking jobs overseas i.e. there is a limit to which we will allow them to effectively manage their payroll and expenses.  This is an argument for the right of the worker i.e. the populist argument.

These two arguments are diametrically opposed as outlined above (again presuming I'm understanding you correctly).

<TEXT> Xanax plus alcohol is a HUGE no-no.

If your BF did not intentionally mix them, then there is nothing you should do. I have a friend who, sadly, has a Harry Potter style scar on his head for the rest of his life from mixing xanax and booze.  Why you ask? Because when he was blacked out he smashed his face against a concrete step outside his dorm in college. I copied something info from internet below (notice what's in bold)

Signs of concurrent alcohol and alprazolam abuse include:

Drowsiness

Slow pulse

Slurred speech

Slow breathing

**Memory problems**

Impaired coordination.

Dizziness.

Unsteady gait. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Simple answer: Lobbyists and who they pay

Example: lets say tomorrow the US government learned that potatoes were the primary source of global warming.

Oregon and Idaho would flip their shit because of the number of potato farmers and the impact it could pose to their local Economies. Before the US could pass a law to regulate potatoes, Oregon and Idaho would hire lawyers and lobbyists to ensure the US government didn't screw with their potato farmers, processing factories etc. They'd probably also fund studies to show its not potatoes but those assholes in Kansas and their corn that's the problem.

Now replace Oregon and Idaho with Texas and handful of other states. And the "potato farmers" with Exxon (who has billions of $).

At its core global warming is a regulation of capitalism issue (not regulation of the environment.) The hallmark of capitalism is the "free market economy" which many misrepresent as "unfettered economy."

<TEXT> KPMG is low balling you because they know they can.

Think of it this way. There are 4 large accounting firms at this point and, if you hire one to audit you, etc, no one thinks twice because they are the gold standard.

Thus, you getting to put on your resume for a future role "I interned at a gold standard accounting firm" has additional value beyond your salary.

Further, sometimes you have to take a lower paying job to get to a better one later.

Don't think of it only as money in your pocket now.  </TEXT>

CPA - waste of time if you don't want to be an accountant
CFP - waste of time if you don't want to be a financial planner
CMT - waste of time if you don't want to be an equity trader

If your focus is truly tech, then all of the above will have limited application. Generally speaking, if you have any of the above, then you will make way more money using them *in their intended fields*. Otherwise, you're like Tim Tebow trying to be a baseball player.

<TEXT> I work in the industry and a lot of people that I interview for roles on my team look at my LinkedIn profile first (and I do the same re: the candidates.)

However, that won't help you much in the interview. You're better off learning about the company instead of the interviewer. Hiring managers want to see you appreciate who the firm is and that you want to be a part of it.

Did they create the first mutual funds?

Did they start off as a cotton trading commodity firm?

Were they founded by a Secretary of the Treasury?

All of those are real questions I learned the answers to by reading about the companies where I interviewed and/or worked.  Culture, values and fit are just as important as your resume.

Do your homework in regards to all of the above and you'll have a leg up on your competition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is DEFINITELY coming.  They don't charge that way *yet*

As cable TV falls behind streaming service and over the top solutions (like HBO GO), more and more of what's broadcast will be internet based.

The big thing to keep in mind is the age of industry.  Cable is having to adjust to what the market wants but they're slow to catch up (e.g. I live in Philly and can now get Netflix through my Comcast TV package as a standard offering; however, I've been steaming Comcast on their internet service for 6 years)

As that industry pivots from "cable" to "internet" there will be adjustments.  This change in billing will be one of them. </TEXT>

Diamonds are the perfect real world example.

Diamonds are abundant on Earth; however, the sale of diamonds is controlled primarily by the DeBeers diamond cartel.

They intentionally restrict the supply of this *very* common rock to drive up the price. With everyone wanting a diamond engagement ring, and the number of diamonds intentionally limited by DeBeers, everyone has to pay more to get that diamond.

<TEXT> While I agree with the previous poster, as someone who works in Banking/Finance/Investments I can tell you the real reason is:

Checks bounce.  Bounced checks have huge fees which means money for banks (they were $25 to $50 almost 20 years ago!)

Electronic transfers remove the potential for bounced checks I.e. Banks lose the revenue from bounced check fees

To offset the loss of revenue, they charge an upfront fee for electronic transfers.

This same thing happened with overdraft fees a few years back. Checking accounts were free but overdrafts incurred huge fees.  When banks could no longer charge them without customers opting in, free checking evaporated overnight I.e. They charge a fee for those accounts now to make up for lost revenue from overdraft fees.

If this were called explain like I'm 50:

The hardware costs cited above are ultimately capitalized and depreciated by any financial institution as that's an asset to the company. So while yes that is also a motivating factor for the fee, IRS accounting rules offset the initial investment to build all infrastructure and applications required to process the electronic transfers. </TEXT>

Reason 1:
White rice is milled and polished (i.e. processed and refined). These two steps both make it white and remove nutrients

Reason 2:
As a result, white rice also becomes a short chain carbohydrate (sugar) whereas brown rice is a long chain carbohydrate. 

Long chain carbs (often called "good carbs") take longer for the body to break down and use as energy i.e. after you eat them you are not fuller, long.

Short chain carbs (often called "bad carbs"), are broken down more quickly i.e. you are hungry again sooner

The Commerce Clause is a section of the US Constitution "which gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.

Civil Rights Changes were passed under this.

Essentially, discrimination in business interferes with capitalism and government regulation.

Since no one can theoretically lose money by not entering your home, the government doesn't care.

Electric Company and Waterworks should just be replaced as bills you pay called "College Loans" and "Overpriced Fair Trade Coffee"

For example, Mediterranean and Baltic aves need to be "Your Parents' Basement" and "Your Parents' Attic"

<TEXT> While I appreciate there aren't many guns in your area, there are enough guns in America for almost *every* citizen to have one (link 1).

A gun is just the most obvious scenario. I use myself as the example because I'm not a large man (both shorter and weigh less than average.) I.e overpowering me should be easier for even an average sized man.   But that doesn't matter because a single blind punch, that I'm not guarding against, would be enough to knock me, or anyone, out cold.

Judgment really doesn't enter the equation as women are expected to do this. Those that don't **are** exercising better judgment, but those that don't aren't viewed as having poor judgment (hence my post.) it's considered a societal norm so women do it.

Lastly, assuming we know anything about anyone in this day is dangerous. Thanks to the rise of online dating and hookup apps, it's even less likely you know anything tangible about your date besides their name (and, as a real world example, both I and the girl I'm seeing learned each other's actual first names on first date. We **both** lied in profile)

I think all of your points distinguishing between children and adults are valid, but that doesn't invalidate that we as a society don't question the risk we find acceptable for women. Even if it is less than the child scenario, it's more than most men I know would accept for themselves.

If you get in and close the door, and the person drives away, then 5 minutes later pulls out a handgun...well you're pretty much screwed no matter what.

Yes, a grown woman is stronger than a child I.e. She has a better likelihood of getting away. But that doesn't explain why we expect her to put herself in a dangerous situation in the first place.

Just because she *might* get away, isn't a justification for the risk. </TEXT>

The author extrapolates people will go commit crimes based on other situations rooted in the *appearance of their avatar.* Being more confident because of a tall avatar is a significant leap from virtual murder **could** lead to actual murder. 

Additionally, the first video game study she references used a sample size of 70 people. The second citation is waaay TL;DR. I'm willing to entertain the larger point if her tangential research wasn't used to reach a specious conclusion.

The larger point she's making, and it isn't the clickbait headline, is: 

"Virtual Reality alters our physical and mental perception of self. Society must be prepared to address these challenges as VR becomes more widely available"

...but that headline doesn't generate advertising revenue

<TEXT> My comment lacks sufficient clarity. If you'll humor me, I'll expound on my thinking:

Whether a person, child or woman, is going to be abducted is in the mind of the person operating the vehicle

We tell children it's *not okay* to get in a stranger's car because we presume a stranger *will* do them harm (which is an unquestionably fair conclusion)

We tell women it *is okay* for them to get in a stranger's car because a stranger *most likely* won't do them harm (which is an arguably fair conclusion)

However, in both scenarios, neither the woman nor the child knows the thoughts of the driver i.e. the risk mechanics of the situation don't change.

A woman getting in the car of a stranger is no different than a child doing the same because both have the same lack of knowledge.  As a society we just accept one as okay (the reason for that is up for debate) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This explanation is awesome.  That said, to explain like poster is 5, I would have shortened it to:

Breasts, unlike hands, attract a mate

Hormones make breasts large (preferred when mating)

Hormones can lead to breasts of different sizes (not preferred when mating)

Hormones also weaken immune system (Not preferred when mating)

Thus, a woman with large breasts that are the same size has good genes (optimal for mating)

Gross oversimplification of a fantastic answer but it is an ELI5 :)

<TEXT> While I'm reticent to encourage what I feel like will lead to a very angry argument, I would say:

1) Ask them to point to the part of the bible that justifies their feelings about homosexuals.  This matters because the counterpoint is different based on what they quote
2) Familiarize yourself with the common arguments and the counter arguments at link below.  Most people will point to the Holiness Codes of Leviticus as their reason, so I'd focus here. This is where the frequently cited "a man shall not lie with another man" comes from. As does "a man shall not wear a clothing of mixed fibers" and "a man shall not eat shellfish."

That said, if you want to change someone's mind, then you are better off helping them to recognize the errors in their own logic as opposed to trying to forcefully make your own points.  No matter how many times you scream "YOU'RE A HYPOCRITE BECAUSE OF THIS OTHER POINT", the person with whom you're arguing still holds that their belief is correct because you haven't eroded the core tenets of the *original* point that they made.

To illustrate my point in a stupid example:

If I said animals are stupid and have no rights, then you might respond, "What about gorillas that know sign language? They aren't stupid."

I could say back, "That's an exception fallacy because you're holding up an infinitesimal group of a single species as evidence for the entire animal kingdom's iintelligence."

While your point would be valid above, you've done nothing to make me critically consider my argument. If I was forced to define my assumptions like "what is an animal", "what is stupid" and "what are rights?" I'm more likely to reveal a flaw in my reasoning that you can exploit in your argument.

In your example, if their basis is the holiness codes, then you need to undermine their reverence for the holiness codes and not point to other scripture that appears to contradict the holiness codes (Not contained therein)

Finally, you're trying to argue a logical point with a person holding up a faith based argument. While it never hurts to try, you're more likely to tear your hair out than they are to *alter their faith.* I wish you luck.

I recognize compared to how we evolved, our expectations of meat consumption are probably unrealistic compared to our forebears; however, that still doesn't make eating meat an ethical dilemma.

It only means the modern approach to raising livestock presents an ethical dilemma (OR the modern diet presents an ethical dilemma...which is probably the actual case) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm actually closer to your second point ie the likelihood of prions diseases from cannibalism
should act as a deterrent not that all humans will get a prion disease from a single bite of human flesh (and while I know the brain is more likely to transmit that type of disease, my understanding is any part of a human can)...also, I can't believe I just typed that monstrous paragraph.

While I realize strictly relying on odds can be a statistical fallacy; we can hold up the example of BSE in England/Ireland as what can happen with large scale cannibalism (cows were fed to other cows, that were slaughtered where sheep ate other sheep ---then humans ate the cows.). I realize that's a single morbid example but, Thankfully, there aren't many examples of outbreaks of prions diseases specifically because we aren't typically eating animals that are forced to cannibalize other members of their species.  

I would argue an "inferior" creature has no morality. Morality is a mental construct that arose from human self actualization.  The lion eating me is an amoral act.

As per children punching adults and the outcome, modern western societies believe what you said (and I agree). That doesn't mean everyone does (or that even everyone in western society does.)

Think of the controversial case of NFL player Adrian Peterson hitting his son with a "switch" as a form of discipline. Personally I found this appalling BUT I know many people who disagreed.  I'm not saying they're wrong (hint: they're wrong) BUT I'm saying the morality of something like that isn't "common sense"

Consumption of food is amoral.

If you're dying in the desert and see an animal to eat, out of self preservation, a person typically kills that animal and eats it.

That's biology. Not ethics.

<TEXT> The scenario you describe with reprogramming predators is some Jurassic Park level playing God. I'm not even going there lmao!

I appreciate your point on impulses vs. actions and agree. The drive to procreate can lead to rape but procreation is amoral and copulation by force (for humans) is immoral. However, that still doesn't address the larger issue of how a person defines what does less harm vis a vis consumption.

If for a given person, a single human suffering outweighs the pain of *every* livestock animal on Earth, then they are correct in *their* view to state, "I will not eat any vegetables because humans are exploited." (They may not consider humans were possibly exploited to get the grains)

I doubt anyone has ever worked out the math to say definitively "the wholesale slaughter of animals is worse than the exploitation of people because of X factors"; however, even then, id imagine most people would have hard time accepting that argument.

Just like we are biologically preprogrammed to eat, we are biologically preprogrammed to prefer that which is most like us (which is the same reason why countries like Norway and Finland are always rated happiest...homogeneous surroundings...but that's a whole different topic!!)

His point is the eating, not the killing.

My argument (implicitly) states you (a single person) can kill a single animal to eat it without presenting an ethical dilemma as eating is a biological imperative.

<TEXT> Because consumption is a biological imperative and humans are omnivores, as such, the act of consumption in and of itself is an amoral concept.

We can pick what we choose to eat but the act of eating (or killing an animal to eat, because you wouldn't eat a live animal), is not an ethical quandary.

To take it to an extreme conclusion, self preservation  dictates anyone would sooner eat than die. 

If an animal was the only option, then you would eat that animal because eating is a biological imperative for surviving.

For Anyone that would say otherwise, I'd be interested to hear them argue for their own death over eating an animal.

Also, because the typical comeback here is the lifeboat scenario, "do you murder another person to eat them and survive" --I'm not going there. Don't be a barbarian on thanksgiving!!

<TEXT> An avalanche and an animal hunting are a false equivalency. Avalanches are prevented with...avalanches (albeit smaller controlled ones.) same goes for forest fires.  Having a lion eat "smaller, controlled" amounts of gazelle doesn't resolve the argument some pose about having issues with non-human animals eating other non-human animals (which is bonkers to me and again, I know you aren't arguing this point)

I definitely oversimplified my calculus (and concede yours is a more accurate representation) but the open utilitarian question remains the same: what's the level of acceptable "ethical malfeasance" -for lack of a Better term (knowing that your answer doesn't negate the fact that eating is still an amoral, biological imperative).

<TEXT> I would disagree whole heartedly. We cannot foist a value system upon a wild animal (disagreeing with larger point, I know you said you don't feel that way.)

We have a responsibility to modify our behavior in accordance with moral reasoning; however, eating is a biological imperative.

We can choose what we eat but both sides have sacrifices.  Most agricultural products are picked by exploited labor, yet that is frequently ignored by society (comparatively).

You can eat primarily vegetarian knowing you're tacitly exploiting people or eat primarily animal meat knowing animals are inhumanely slaughtered.  Thus, utilitarian calculus, what matters more: 

X number of exploited people 

or Y number of slaughtered animals.

Naturalistic fallacy:

Thus, x is morally correct

My point:
X occurs in nature,
Thus, x is not morally incorrect 

Here's where you scream and I explain why that's different.

The act of eating meat is amoral (IMO).  How you get the meat, raise the meat, slaughter the meat, all of that is up for an ethical discussion. Eating the meat is not.

Humans are omnivores and eating is a biological imperative. You can choose what you eat but that does Not rise to an ethical quandary until you consider how you get the food (or dietary restrictions etc). Humans have a requirement to eat just like we have a requirement to breathe (hence my points about that those things.) the original post is: is it ethically wrong to eat meat? My response is: no and ethics never enters the equation.

<TEXT> Sorry, because I use natural and biological interchangeably it creates an issue.

For me, eating is an amoral act, whether that's fruit or animals.  It does not rise to the level of an ethical question because the act of eating is a biological imperative. How we obtain meat, slaughter animals etc are all ethical questions but my argument is that, biologically, there is not a morality question to be asked.

As per violence, that is not a biological imperative. A human can live a lifetime without violence (and is most likely the better for it.). 

Respiration, consumption, excretion - biological imperatives

Violence, copulation, drug use - actions that can be viewed through the lens of morality

<TEXT> Thanks for responding to this (I looked it up too after getting home).

Generally, there are a *ton* of reasons cannibalism occurs in animal kingdom. That said, it seems like in many cases there is an evolutionary reason to why that cannibalism is occurring (and it also doesn't read like they are eating them just to make a meal).

For example, the big cat one I am familiar with but I also know the main reason male lions do it is so that the females will come back into heat.  So, not knowing enough, I would ask, are they actually *eating* the young for purposes of nutritional needs *or* are they just killing them. Additionally, a human female won't come into heat strictly because a potential mate eats her children i.e. cannibalism as a practical act does not necessarily hold the same benefits for humans as it may for another species.

All of that said, and not split hairs, I take your larger point.

<TEXT> It does matter because my primary point is ultimately about biology and not ethics.  

Ethics are mental constructs we've developed thanks to self-actualization.

As per quinoa vs. animals, if you check a later post I compare the deaths of sentient animals to suffering migrant workers. Quinoa was a food so I kept the theme, so to speak. My larger point, which was admittedly not eloquently stated in my original analogy, is that there is no modern method of consumption that has zero negative impact. It's about compromise.  

Do you care more about humans suffering in fields to pick vegetables (whole foods), coffee beans (starbucks), or cacao beans (all chocolate...and oh yeah...child labor)

Or do you care more about animals suffering - basically all meat.

I'm not making the point that one is more ethically acceptable than the other as they are both riddled with ethical dilemmas.

However, the simple *biological act of eating either* is not a moral question. We **are humans** and **humans eat these things**.  Thus my original point, it is not immoral to eat animals.  How we get the animals to our mouths, is a different argument.

I am not definitely not here to troll, but I was a philosophy major (which a number of people I know might call the same thing)

<TEXT> Almost but not quite. The naturalistic fallacy states:

According to nature, X is true

Thus, X is morally correct

I am actually arguing:

According to nature, X is true

Thus, x *is not* morally *incorrect*

You may be screaming at your computer right now "That's the same fucking thing."  However, I disagree because to me consumption of meat from a biological perspective is not a binary, moral question but an amoral one.  Hence my points about metabolism, reproduction, etc which specifically speak to the biological definition of being alive.

Now, going further into your point, war is not ethical in *your* system of values. There are numerous warrior cultures from history for whom there is no dilemma.  The challenge is the omnipresent ethical relativism.  It's easy to say war is unethical, and I agree, but that doesn't mean everyone does.  Your point presupposes an absolute based on modern western values.

You said it, humans are omnivores. Omnivores by definition eat meat.  That's the exact biological argument I'm making.  We *can* eat vegetables as you state but that doesn't make it morally incorrect to not eat vegetables.

I actually didn't argue any of those reasons of why we shouldn't eat people lol.  However, the more salient point you make is "do animals have the same rights as people" as that is the core of the next few sentences. There I would say, "they do not."  While I believe they do have rights to not suffer, if we had equal rights does that mean I could walk through woods with out being eaten by a puma? Of course not, because I'm projecting my system of ethics on the puma. It doesn't care about that, because I'm lunch. This argument expects an equal treatment of animals that ultimately ends up with *their* treating *us* unequally.

All of that said, I don't deny any of your climate change arguments, etc but all of those extrinsic the actual eating of meat.  That is how we get the meat, not eat it.

Enjoy your vegetarian Thanksgiving! 

And I agree, WOLVES ARE MAJESTIC! I was lucky enough to see one of the packs that roams Hayden Valley in Yellowstone but they were actually on the road. One of my favorite national park memories. </TEXT>

As per the handicapped, etc - we care about them because those are *Our* system of morals; however, not all humans feel that way.  Calling eugenics a pseudoscience does a disservice to pseudoscience but people *do* exist that don't think we should care about them. (I do not fall into this camp but I'd remiss if I didn't mention it) If we want to go down the path of bioethics, then we can discuss what happens in this realm with genetic manipulation in utero (that's a deep dark hole)

I was replying to your use of cherrypicking about Quinoa (I wasn't saying you were cherrypicking). 

As per whether I care about these issues was never actually up for debate (in my min). The original post was: 

is it morally wrong to eat meat?

In the vacuum of biology, the answer is no.

When you consider **all** possible aspects of how meat gets to your mouth, then I understand there are many arguments to be made (hence why I made my last point in my first post).

If quinoa is cherry picking, then allow me to make the argument for exploitation of workers in American fields. Why is that okay? Without exploited labor, a large amount of our vegetables and fruits don't get picked or become significantly more expensive (and potentially limit the number of consumers who can afford them.) Fruits and veggies aren't perfect foods that grow themselves in a vacuum and magically make it to Whole Foods. However, the process of their production is often considered less upsetting because the humans that are exploited to pick them have far fewer videos than the animals slaughtered on killing floors.

<TEXT> I would make the animal farm argument 

"Some animals are more equal than others" in western society.

For example, I cant shoot and skin a dog in my backyard but no one would flinch at a deer. As such, I would argue there is not shared sense of morality because "pets" are exempted from certain treatment. This is kind of like Hans landa's argument in inglorious basterds on the difference between a rat and squirrel "they look rather the same except for the bushy tail but you would not treat a squirrel with such contempt" (paraphrasing)

Also, animal cruelty is not "eating meat."

If I humanely kill a pig and eat it, then theoretically no harm, no foul. If I have not "harmed" the animal strictly to cause it pain BUT this is a very different argument than the point of the video. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My point is that morality is an instilled human concept and not one that is universal.

However, almost all human societies have some system of morals (and almost all of them dictate that children are a part of those moral systems I.e. They are covered by them and expected to learn them.) the issues we get into are when those moral systems conflict I.e. relativism.  

For example, female circumcision is a barbaric practice.

In western cultures, this practice is in conflict with our moral system of how children are to be treated I.e. It is a moral violation.  However, for the cultures that practice it, it is not. (Just to be clear, I am one million % against female circumcision)

Net-net: children are covered by moral systems they are born into even if they don't understand them (and adults within that society act in accordance with them)

That said, animals have no moral code to which they are bound (I feel like someone's going to jump in here and correct me but so be it). Similarly, we have no moral obligation under our system of morals to not eat something unless for example you're Hindu (cows). </TEXT>

Your second comment I tried to address with my closing point I.e. Agricultural and livestock treatment.  There are a lot of arguments on all sides. For example, why is eating meat morally unacceptable to vegetarians/vegans but no one ever cites quinoa as morally unacceptable (see link below.). In a modern society, there are pitfalls to everything I.e. It isn't fair to focus on just one and argue the others have no flaws.

I wouldn't (and didn't) argue we eat meat out of tradition. If I ever argue *for* tradition, then I'll assume someone put bleach in my coffee lol

<TEXT> You're conflating meat and cows.  

I'm aware human agriculture is the largest source of methane emissions; however, the question isn't whether human agricultural practices have contributed to global warming (which is an obvious yes.)

The original post is a single argument of whether I am morally permitted to eat meat (from any animal not just a cow.)

The analogy I gave another poster was drinking juice. Is it morally acceptable for you to squeeze a fruit and drink its juice? I'm not asking your thoughts on agriculture, GMOs or how fruit is grown. I'm asking are you morally permitted to squeeze a piece of fruit and drink the juice.

The simplicity of the question is what makes it easy to answer.

ThAt said, if your concern is cattle then your next logical question should be, "Is Hinduism morally unacceptable." India has the second highest number of cattle on earth and yet slaughter of cattle is illegal throughout much of the country.

I'm *AM NOT* arguing Hinduism is morally unacceptable, but if you're arguing cattle represent a significant threat to the world, then logically speaking, India represents the second largest individual threat and they don't eat the animal in most cases.

I'm not sure I understand your second point, but it sounds like you're equating morality in children with morality in animals I.e.

<TEXT> I would argue pillage and rape are either learned or evolutionary behaviors.  While they may occur in nature, they are not "natural" as I earlier defined it.

For example, I said to another poster that they were conflating procreation and copulation.  To be more specific.

Procreation for humans: penis inserted into vagina and Sperm fertilizes ovum.

Copulation: whatever action is taken to get the penis in the vagina lol. (Strictly sticking with heterosexual sex for sake of ease).

If copulation is consensual, an orgy or rape - they are all the acts that lead to how biological "natural" procreation occurs. I know logically separating the two sounds strange but there is an important distinction to be made because not all heterosexual copulation is intended to lead to procreation. 

I'm not making an ethical argument about whether humans can commit rape because animals do. I'm making a biological argument that humans can eat animals, because all biological signs IMO point to yes.  I know this is posted in philosophy, but this doesn't raise to a philosophical conundrum for me because strict consumption of animals isn't an ethical quandary (to me.) </TEXT>

I can't answer the second question because I don't know how you are defining natural.

<TEXT> So, I'm going to take a different approach than maker of the video:

He posits that's we don't eat people because it is morally wrong.

I don't disagree as a member of western civilization but there are societies that would (from a ritualistic perspective.) THAT SAID, he ignores another reason that we don't eat people is biological. Consumption of human flesh is linked to infectious prions diseases in humans I.e. There is a sound biological/natural argument against eating other humans.

So, that being the case, is there a similar argument to made for consumption of animals I.e. Is there a legitimate biological outcome whereby eating them explicitly harms humans? As far as I am aware, while overconsumption may be a problem, there is no animal that we can say "eating X animal is definitively tied to killing people."

So, if we accept that as true, then we know nature isn't holding up a stop sign that says "don't eat other animals", why is it okay/do we do it. Here, I will argue is because the answer is because that IT IS natural.  Despite our self-actualization and higher levels of reasoning, we are still part of the animal world and share all the same qualities as the animals we consume I.e. Metabolism,  reproduction etc.

We are not morally bound to not eat animals, especially since I don't believe other animals even have the concepts of morality. 

That said: the treatment of animals we slaughter for food and how humane that slaughter is a worthwhile  (and I know contentious) debate.

For anyone in the tl;dr camp, the potential psychological problems considered by the study were: 

depression, psychological distress/stress, substance use, body image problems, other psychological problems, and negative social functioning (e.g., loneliness)

Obviously all of these are a concern to a psychologist, but the layperson reading this headline will read:

"Men who see themselves as playboys or as having power over women are more likely to have psychological problems"

<TEXT> Every country has sex criminals yes but not every country deals with this:

*The material shows, among other things, the penetration of toddlers, children being tied up, children having sex with animals and children having sex with other children*

To say every country has sex criminals falsely equates all sex crimes as being of the same severity.

For example, in the United States we have "Romeo and Juliet" laws meant to cover cases of statutory rape whereby both individuals are teenagers. My understanding is, based on the age difference between the teens, the law determines whether it meets the measure of a crime (and I believe this varies by state).

If an 18 year old senior in an American high school is dating/sleeping with a 16 year old junior (and that could happen based on ages above), most Americans would not say that rises to a crime BUT their state law may say differently and classify it as statutory rape. Yet, in another state the same age difference may not rise to the level of a crime. Further, all of those laws explicitly exist because application of the general crime of "rape" isn't entire applicable when both individuals give consent.  Ultimately, I think this forces the casual observer to agree sex crimes have levels of severity.

Which brings us back to the Norway situation above.  It is not that sex criminals exist and, as such, the judicial system can handle it. It is that sex criminals that commit *these* type of sex crimes exist and existing laws/imprisonment rules may not adequately address the severity of the crime.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find this interesting given how few countries meet their NATO spending targets.

It's almost like they want an army to protect them but don't want to pay for it.

Oh wait, that's us, by which I mean U.S. 

The time of the U.S. Hegemony in Europe needs to end. The fact that economic powerhouses like Germany and France don't meet their spending minimums is proof that they're content to let us foot the bill. I'm by no means jingoistic but this is the kind of shit that pisses me off.

<TEXT> "When I was a teenager, I was really scared of losing my virginity. But then I came to understand, heterosexual intercourse just means the insertion of the male sex organ into a receptive, aroused vaginal canal and the distribution of gametes in the hopes of fertilizing an ovum that may become a zygote. Then I thought, well it's really silly to be afraid of the insertion of the male sex organ. Then I wasn't afraid of losing my virginity after that."

<TEXT> A large number of rich/famous people are only rich/famous for nepotistic reasons.

No matter how much talent you have, it probably doesn't matter if you don't already know someone with some level of fame.

Take Gigi   Bella Hadid. You know why they're famous? Their father is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and known for building luxury residences in LA.

His wife was a star of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills (and I wouldn't be surprised if Mohamed Hadid built some of the other homes those housewives lived in).

Or perhaps looks at Nicola Peltz, Michael Bay's eye candy for Transformers 4. She wasn't a random teen that won an audition. She's the daughter of a billionaire fund manager that decided she wanted to be an actress.

This combination of wealth and pseudo-fame overcomes any lack of talent or ability the children may have by getting them in the door.

Apply this same logic to Kate Hudson, Gwyneth Paltrow, all Kardashian-Jenner, Billy Bush, Ben Stiller, Jaden   Willow Smith, Angelia Jolie, Nicolas Cage and soon to include North West and Blue Ivy Carter, etc., etc., etc.

Net-net: Don't bank on rich and famous, if your family isn't already one or the other.

<TEXT> I would disagree for the exact reason you said: the *commonly* used informal ones.

Having taken logic courses in college I understand and appreciate your larger point, but the way people argue does not usually follow logic. Ultimately, we are talking about logos vs. pathos.

An ad hominem argument is, at its core, a pathos argument.  Donald Trump performed well in the U.S. election not because he was a policy wonk appealing to logic, but because he spoke to people's emotions.

Look at the nicknames alone, "Lil' Marco", "Lyin' Ted", "Crooked Hillary". Irrespective of any logical argument to be made, his responses were ad hominem attacks before he said *anything* that represented his own point of view (and it was clearly highly effective).

Net-Net: All logical fallacies are worth knowing but, in the real world, I don't think formal logic is usually entering the equation.

It didn't matter. 

Judgment Day came anyway. Only instead of a full nuclear assault that eradicated most of life on Earth, it began by taking jobs making shitty clothing in Bangladesh that would be sold by Kanye West.Then it expanded to Beyonc's clothing line. Then Nike. Until finally it spread to luxury goods like Prada and car factories like Mercedes Benz. By the time we knew what happened it was already too late.  We estimate that within 200 years the machines will put everyone out of work and Skynet will takeover with its army of sewing machines, machine presses and rivet guns."

State rights are nice and good, but this is an area where a federal law that states "this is what you need to vote" would eliminate a lot of headaches e.g. Voting rights act issues, concerns about voter fraud, etc. I know that's an oversimplification to some degree because challenges would still occur but something as consequential as voting should have universal requirements (and it should also be a federal holiday...because fuck it I want another vacation day!)

<TEXT> Thank you!

The internet certainly makes it difficult (since interpreting satire is near impossible), but I honestly believe every American wants America to succeed.

The challenge arises in how we define success.

I disagree with trump on many things but I know he also wants America to succeed. The trick for him, and it would have been the same for Clinton, is to forge a path where all Americans believe they are reaping the rewards of that success.

The problem is that people today only qualify their success as a "success" if the other side of the aisle "fails."  Politics isn't supposed to be binary. It's supposed to be about compromise.  But since most politicians are lawyers, and lawyers get paid to make their point, compromise seems to be a measure of last resort for the US government. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LOL. Touch. 

That said, unlike most people, I recognize the president (meaning any US president) is not vested with unilateral authority in many regards.

Do I think more socially conservative policies will come to pass? Probably.

Do I think regulations will be rolled back and big business will benefit more than regular citizens? Almost certainly.

Do I think draining the swamp will happen? Definitely not.

You're clearly a Trump supporter and I'm actually not well represented by any party. That said, I think we can both agree the US political system is fundamentally broken. If Trump can bring about positive change for his supporters without pushing down his detractors, then that's fantastic and I hope he does.

A rising tide is supposed to lift all ships. Populism by definition is supposed to be about the people I.e. Regular people as opposed to elites. Whether you're working class and white or working class and Muslim, you should be represented by a populist president. If Trump can be a truly populist president, then that's great for America.

Since the man is yet to even be sworn in, it's unfair to judge him from a presidential perspective.

All of that said, the action cited above by Obama is also a populist move. This is an action that protects indigenous people that have been victimized by America for centuries. If you're populist, then you have to applaud this action. Job creation does not outweigh the right to your home. And if you disagree with that, then allow me to propose an analogy: eminent domain.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as checking on being registered to vote, that depends on your state. For example, I live in Pennsylvania and there is a website I can go to that allows me to check my voter status. Unfortunately, not every state works the same way so I can't give you a blanket answer of how to check.  That said, if you google your state name and register to vote, it will probably lead you to either an 800 number or email address that can tell you your registration status.  I think some states sign you up to vote just by getting a driver's license, so it really is luck of the draw based on where you live.

As per the pay you get from jury duty.  Jury duty is a legal requirement and, unless you give the court a valid reason why you can't attend juror selection, you will get in legal trouble. (If you can provide a valid reason you'll be excused).

Your employer is required by law to allow you to attend jury duty as it is a civic duty. At my previous employers, people on jury duty were paid like any other work day and the pay given for jury duty was essentially paid to the employer. This offsets the fact that they have to pay you, but you aren't working. But again, and I can't stress this enough, unless your job is a legitimate reason why you can't attend juror selection (e.g. You travel for work and you will be out of the country working...remember they always call more people than they need), your employer can't just say "you can't go to jury duty because I said so"

Anything that goes to trial gets a jury. Generally speaking: traffic court, small claims court and family court won't have a jury (to my knowledge.) If an actual crime was committed (e.g. Not illegally parking...that's not really a crime in the sense I mean it) and no settlement occurs, then it will go to a jury trial.  

Finally, as per pros vs. cons, there are no pros to jury duty. That's why they call it duty. It is your responsibility as a member of society under the bill of rights to ensure your fellow man is given the right to a trial with a jury of his peers (I think it's the 7th amendment). Because it is a constitutional right, we uphold it and do what is required. Because it's generally boring, most people hate it.  That said, if you're ever falsely accused of something, you'll be real happy other people are performing their civic duty! </TEXT>

If I found it, and that was my question, then I can't possibly cause a paradox because the all knowing 8 ball of the future already has the answer to my question.

The future course of events is immutable and I, mega millions winner, is a predetermined event by virtue of having found the toy with the winning numbers. By not giving me the numbers, the magic 8 ball is changing the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They would try to exclude anyone that might be biased.

It could go way beyond race.

For example, if the white guy was in the knights of Columbus and the Asian guy was a teacher, the prosecutors would look to exclude any jurors that are KoC members and defense would look to exclude to teachers, for fear of biases.

As part of jury pool, they outright ask you, "are there any reasons you don't believe you can objectively provide a verdict on the case" (paraphrasing).

Now, people can lie but I believe that can open the door to a mistrial due to juror misconduct I.e. The case is thrown out/retried with a new jury. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Generally speaking, being called for jury duty is typically tied to whether you are registered to vote in your state.

Based on your post, I'm assuming either:
All of your friends, and you, are lucky,

Or many of you are not registered to vote


As per what it entails, after being called you go through a selection process with prosecution and defense attorney where they weed out undesirable jurors (they always call more people than they need).

E.g. If a white guy killed an Asian guy, and you're an Asian guy, the defense is more likely to want to exclude you due to a presupposition that as an Asian you would be more inclined to find their client guilty.

If you end up selected, then it really is just listening to the court case and coming to a verdict with fellow jurors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> UGMA/UTMA are types of accounts where a minor (in this case you) is the owner of the assets and an adult (usually a parent) oversees the account. All transactions must be your benefit e:g. They can't take your money and buy a boat.

When you reached the age of majority (varies by state, usually 18) the money is yours.

That said, your wealth manager should be telling you what to do with the money.  .5% fee based on AUM (assets under management) is a realistic fee but what is their performance? If your investment performance lags the market significantly than you should probably fire them. Again, don't take action until you research this.

Also, based on your funds, you might want to look at roboadvisors. Not to rain on your parade, but in the world of wealth management, you do not have anything resembling a "shit ton" of money. Unless your advisor manages only small accounts, you probably don't get much attention and a roboadvisor program would probably charge lower fees and keep you in something like index funds that hew close to the market returns.

Note: I work for an investment management firm.

With this John Lennon comment:
Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I'll be proved right. **We're more popular than Jesus now**; I don't know which will go firstrock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.

<TEXT> While I appreciate your point, with Singer it is easy to lose the forest for the trees.

His utilitarian views are ones that, for many, are morally reprehensible (even though those views may make logical sense).

For example, most people would agree that it is preferable to have a child that is not handicapped as opposed to a child that is. While this may seem logical, the commentary is viewed in the vacuum of what the reader may define as "handicapped." For example, I'm epileptic, but you wouldn't know that in utero. Do you execute me when you see signs (which BTW was at 13)? Logic is clean, but reality isn't.

While I myself send tend to skew towards many of Singer's points of view, I would be remiss if I didn't say that those same points of view could be corrupted e.g. The Nazis and ANYONE else. 

Practical ethics is invaluable, but if I recite Hamlet to my dog, and the only word he understands is "sit", then I haven't accomplished anything.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I appreciate that, I majored in philosophy (specifically ethics)

Singer has long been "contentious" for lack of a better word.

Positing that we should legalize what other countries have already done is hardly trailblazing, hence my snarky comment.

He is logical in a way that makes Sheldon Cooper look like Russell Crowe in Gladiator when he finds his family dead. 

Yes, prostitution should be legal for MANY reasons in US. My real point was simply that Singer tends to argue for better rights for animals (not including my opinion) or why we should, from a utilitarian perspective, eliminate genetic abnormalities (again, not sharing my opinion)

Him writing this article is like Babe Ruth playing in the beer leagues.  Unless Princeton said, "we need x number of articles per month," this seems to be a waste of his time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Best thing that could happen to America: Calexit.

California GDP is 6th largest in World
California GDP is almost 15% of entire US GDP
Per Business Insider:
The Golden State's ranches and farms raked in $47 billion in crop cash receipts in 2015. It produces over a third of the country's vegetables and two-thirds of fruits and nuts, making California's agriculture industry the largest in the nation.

California leaving the union would mean tens of billions of dollars in losses to US Gov't every year.  That won't only starve the beast, but the people on programs like SNAP, as well.

And let's not forget, as per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, white households are the largest recipients of government assisted food stamps

Usually, he is positing arguments like (to paraphrase): eugenics will be a natural outcome of society with genetic engineering but only the rich will be able to afford it i.e. the rich will have perfect healthy babies and the poor will have genetically inferior children (that the rich would have modified or terminated in utero)

<TEXT> Rule of thumb with debt is to pay off the highest interest rate first.

Additionally, even though the vehicle is a depreciating asset, by paying it off you are no longer underwater i.e. you can't "technically" lose more money on it (beyond it's loss in value). This allows you to sell it, if need be without concern for an encumberance.

If you dump that money into your mortgage, and the property suddenly ends up underwater, the value of that principal paydown could evaporate. 

Countering this argument would be, are you currently paying an FHA premium or PMI? Would paying that $7,500 into mortgage principal eliminate those payments, and if so, what's the payback date on that?

I.E. At what point does (PMI payment + FHA Payment) * (# of Months of payments) = $7,500 or more.

You could end up saving $7,500 and then some by eliminating those two payments with a principal pay down (depending on your current LTV) 

(Sorry for the seemingly contradicting answers but without knowing more specifics, I'm trying to account for all options. I'm also presuming you have a fixed rate, 30 year mortgage) </TEXT>
