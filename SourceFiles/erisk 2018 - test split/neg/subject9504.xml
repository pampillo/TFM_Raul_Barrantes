<TEXT> This isnt going to be popular, I know this in advance. I am not a Trump fan, but I am open-minded and reasonable. When I first started hearing the term "fake news" thrown around I thought it was just a Trump distraction tactic, but then I started paying attention when I read the news and began noting (just for me) if 1) it was newsworthy, and 2) if so, has it been spun and if not, has it been spun. Thats when I decided that "fake news" is a very real thing. This tweet is probably news, but the article and the accusation that its a threat, fake news.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One spring morning in the early eighties a red-breasted baby bird appeared on my grandfathers back porch. After sufficient time had passed when it was apparent there would be no momma-bird rescue, my grandfather took it in. He fed it worms scavenged from his large yard after a rain and little strips of bologna and watched it grow into an adult bird. I dont think it ever had a name, other than "Bird". Bird always stayed with my grandfather, on his shoulder, or riding in the top of the fishing hat he always wore. Eventually, my grandfather built a small window, complete with a platform for Bird to land on, in the back room of his house so that Bird could come and go. And thats what Bird did. All summer long. Until one day he didnt.  My grandfather must have anticipated this, the only pet I ever knew him to have not returning home one day, but we never spoke of it. Within weeks, maybe a month, Bird was seemingly forgotten, the small window in the back room the only reminder of his ever having been there. Surprisingly, when spring returned the next year another red-breasted baby bird appeared on my grandfathers back porch, and the cycle repeated itself. This happened once more after that. Looking back it was a beautiful thing. Through my eyes my grandfather was the toughest man alive, a WWII veteran who worked as a lineman and electrician after the war.  He once came in contact with high-voltage while working atop a utility pole. The shock knocked him unconscious, causing him to fall from the pole breaking his back. Hitting the ground knocked him back to consciousness. He was told he would never work again, but returned to climbing poles two months later. Probably my biggest memory of my grandfather, captured in an old photograph I have, is him lying in bed, shirtless, with bird standing proudly on his chest. Immediately after the photograph was taken Bird cocked his head to the side, eyed my grandfathers nipple, and bit it. I always laugh when I think of that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A little off topic, but OMG YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT!!  The worst has to be Sprint. I have been a Sprint customer for almost 12 years and have avoided making changes to my account for that reason alone! Isnt that ridiculous of me!! Because the account is so old I am still paying for "free nights and weekends" and "nights and weekends starting at 6pm" for four lines! These cannot be removed from my account through their web interface. It requires a phone call, but anytime I call Sprint I end up speaking to someone in a call center in India (I assume). Sometimes their accents are so thick that I have no idea what they're saying, and I find myself straining to use simple words and phrases to ensure accurate communication. It actually causes me anxiety when I have to call them. Sorry for the rant. I hope you love your Project Fi phone! I love mine! Good luck to you!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fluxion is way more feature-packed than Linset. I got my start on Linset, and had a lot of success with it, but then stumbled upon Fluxion..and I love it for getting into wireless networks. The only problem I had, in the beginning (with both Fluxion and Linset), was getting close enough to a target to take over their network. If I was in an apartment and shared a wall with a target it was no trouble, but sitting in my car outside of a targets office building was a challenge. What I am saying is that both Linset and Fluxion are great tools, but they have their limitations. One way to be more efficient might be to capture the handshake and try cracking it somewhere WHILE you are simultaneously running a Fluxion attack. That would certainly increase your chances and be a more efficient use of time and resources in my opinion. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as I know It is not possible to find someones IP address using only their home address or coordinates. There are other methods that might work with a little luck. Make a webpage and give the link to your target. Once the target visits the webpage from his home location you can retrieve their ip address from logs/code on your site.  Also, if the person sends you an email from his home then his ip address will be included in the email headers (although this isnt the case with gmail). There are more, but thats a start. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This article states "To hear the head of the FBI in essence call the president a liar or wide-eyed conspiratorialist is bracing, if not humiliating..." But that never occurred. At least it didn't occur literally. To twist Comey's actual words , the words he spoke, into that statement seems a bit, well, "fake news-ish" to me. According to the article Comey stated, "I have no information that supports those tweets." He didn't say, "Yeah, no that's bullshit. Trumps a liar." Comey didn't say that. He didn't really say anything like that at all. What he basically said is, "I personally am not aware of any such activity by the Obama administration." To say that this is devastating for Trump isn't even news at all. I'm not even a Trump fan and I feel like this not really news. </TEXT>

It lets you do anything remotely that the user can do. You can take pics with front and back cam, screenshots, view texts, record audio and video, track in real time, open up a shell, everything. It also lets you hide the app from the app drawer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right. I wouldnt pay more than 10-12 bucks to get a five dollar Goodwill shirt fitted. As someone who gets most of his clothes fitted, I would like to learn this also, but I feel like its complicated and time-consuming for the layperson (me). I dont know if you have ever had a shirt fitted by a tailor, but they have you try it on and button it. Then they pull it tight on each side around your body by taking up the slack under your arms. They then use pins to keep that "slack" tight while you remove the shirt. I assume they cut out that pinned slack and sew it back up....but I dont really know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> every town I have lived in has had a tailor shop. Some were also dry cleaners. Tailoring isnt expensive and can make an off-the-rack shirt look like a million bucks. I buy some of my "dress clothes" from the local Goodwill or YMCA for very cheap, and then have them fitted at the tailor. Makes a huge difference. To have a long-sleeve shirt fitted is around ten bucks. I believe pants are cheaper.  </TEXT>

Yesterday, while sitting in the sun during their visit, an out-of-control car jumped the sidewalk, slammed into them both, and ran over my mothers legs. Witnesses are saying that, at the last second, my mother saw the oncoming car and pushed my aunt (her sister) out of its direct path. Here is a picture of them in the hospital together before being sent out to different hospitals for treatment/surgery http://imgur.com/sLVcVJS . The paramedics wheeled mom's bed into her sisters room so they could say goodbye. Here are pics of moms xray. http://imgur.com/zyxSmBU  http://imgur.com/5xVhwfJ  http://imgur.com/9gTaDvW

<TEXT> Once you get into it and start doing it a system for documentation may work itself out. That is, once you begin to become familiar with your duties/procedures/responsibilities, you may find it easier to document. And dont be afraid to change. If you start out with something, but an easier or better method/technique comes forward, then dont be afraid to change. It could be continuously evolving. I started out in a new job and began documenting using notepad. That evolved to multiple text files, which evolved to a spreadsheet, and so on. Good luck! Documentation can save your ass in many different ways!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was hilarious at the time. Recently, while driving with my young son in snowy weather, I became stuck behind a working snowplow that was treating the road with salt pellets. Unable to pass because of other traffic, but wanting to keep up my speed, I was following the truck very closely and being pelted with salt pellets. Not realizing the irony, I turned to my young son who was riding shotgun, and exclaimed "I'm being peppered by this maniac!!" Without missing a beat he immediately said, "I think the term is...salted."  Again, this was hilarious at the time, but it doesnt really seem so now that I have written it out. Here is a pic for reference (pic found online, not actual pic) http://imgur.com/a/9Nqao </TEXT>

Some strange things have happened to me/us in this house recently, things that terrified me that I cant explain. This could be easily explainable. I dont know yet.

<TEXT> This is going to sound strange, but I promise you its true. I have narrowed this issue down to a toilet issue (we have two). Occasionally we hear a long, loud "foghorn-like" sound coming from all around us. Its everywhere and nowhere at the same time, but it only happens when I flush either of the toilets and just after the tank finishes filling up. Does this make sense? Originally, and I am not kidding you here, my wife suspected demonic possession/poltergeist.  Any ideas?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have had unbelievable luck with Linset and Fluxoin when hacking WPA2-protected routers. They are both very similar to one another and are almost a social engineering/phishing attack. They're both simple to use and both automate everything.  If you live in an apartment with numerous wifi ap's then chances are someone will be stupid enough to fall for one of these attacks. I first heard of Linset when installing Wifislax, which if you dont already know, is an OS specifically dedicated to hacking wireless networks. Give them (Linset or Fluxion) a shot. They're simple to use and can be installed on kali if thats what you're using.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although it wasnt one of the issues he ran on, I think Trump will accept Climate Change. Intelligent people believe that Climate Change is one of the most important challenges facing the world. I also think that most Americans in the Trump demographic have compartmentalized issues that may not be on the scale of 'the environment'. They cant think that big.....yet. Their priorities are more localized: jobs, health insurance, retirement. Climate Change just isnt on their minds like it might be for someone who has the resources to think about it.  That being said, I do not see how Trump could ignore the climate issues. The world is pretty much on-board. America cant ignore it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello and thank you for this AMA. A few years ago a farmer in my area went to bed complaining of being tired one evening. When he awoke the next morning he was unable to move and speak, and his ability to breathe was failing. His wife phoned for an ambulance and he was taken to a local hospital and then flown to a hospital in a larger city where he was finally diagnosed with Guillain-Barre. His medical bills were enormous, an amount that he could never pay in his lifetime. So the hospital waived the entire bill. I cant imagine suddenly being locked inside my body and having to depend on others to figure out whats wrong with me.

Sorry for the long story. Was your case as severe as this? Was there a point where you were completely unable to move?  Thanks for sharing. Get well soon! 

THanks again! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its a damn shame that it'll still be business as usual no matter what these emails reveal. We are a nation of sheep and cowards, of people just trying to get by. Nothing changes. We-the-People are just as scared of the US as everyone else. We let ourselves be intimidated and basically have our rights shit on. I am not excluding myself here either. 

...is it time to organize? Time for We-the-People to do something? Take this into our own hands? My children and my childrens children are going to be living in a horror movie if something doesnt change. I am disgusted and outraged, but impotent when it comes to creating the big change that we all know we need..

<TEXT> The correct answer is to use common sense. Usually 'Trusted Uploaders" have a green or purple skull by their names. They're safe. Also, if you are concerned then stay away from the recent torrents and only download from the 'top 100' section. Know the proper file extensions for what you're downloading. Look at what others are downloading. Watch out for the other things mentioned here also, inflated ratios, comments, etc. Pay attention.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I worked IT in a public library for almost ten years. Often I would work alone at night. I'm ashamed to admit this, but many times, late at night/early in the morning, I literally FLED my office, leaving my laptop open and logged in and leaving my personal belongings there because I became so scared. One of our branches was built on the site of an old railroad station and was rumored to be haunted. The place was spooky, and I am not easily spooked. I had many terrifying encounters there: disembodied voices/whispers, shadows, crazy and unexplained noises: bangs, thuds, slaps, all loud enough to make my hair stand on end. On weekends, late at night, sometimes early AM like 2-3am I would take my young son ghost hunting there. On one such occasion we were in the main area of the library snapping pics and attempting to record EVP's. It was an eventful night and we had both become unusually scared simultaneously. I was about to call it off and go home when my son asked loudly "if any spirits/ghosts are present and want to communicate show us a sign." At that very moment we both observed a book from the adult-fiction-area fall off of the top shelf and land on the floor. It landed open and face down...violently. This really scared us...and kicked in our fight-or-flight response. We rushed out to the truck and sped home. The next morning when the sun was up we both went back. The book was still there on the floor. I picked it up to the page it was already opened to and read the first sentence on that page. It began with our last name, which was also the first name of a character in the book, and went something like this, "...and then Lastname picked up the bloody knife and stood over the murdered body of..."  That may not be verbatim and I do not remember the title of the book now. It has been many years. We both still remember this night vividly. True story. If anyone is interested I will post more true stories from the library.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the most disgusting thing I have ever posted here, but maybe it will help someone. My doctor recommended some OTC drops (I dont remember the name, but it was some sort of oily liquid). I put 3-5 drops in each ear while lying on my side so that gravity would help out. Nothing happened the first day, but on the second day I felt something dislodge in both ears. I used a bobbypin and gently probed around in my ear until I felt something moving. What I pulled out was...a horrible abomination..from BOTH EARS...and I am clean..very clean- shower thoroughly sometimes 2x per day. My hearing immediately improved significantly. What I pulled out of each ear was a combination of wax, skin, hair, and death. It was embarrassing, but I learned how to keep my ears clean. The idea is that the oil breaks loose the "wax plug" from your ear canal and makes it easy to pull out, intact, with some sort of tool. Gross. I am so embarrassed now. Should have used a throw-away account. </TEXT>

<TEXT> because we're all conditioned to think this is the greatest country in the world and that we're the luckiest people in the world. You'll never see an uprising in america. We're all sheep and dont even know it. We will continue to get fucked more and more until one day we'll just take our paychecks and hand them directly over to the big corporations, more blatantly than we already do, while our rights are progressively stolen. And we'll never complain, because this is America! Land of the "we're lucky to be here!" Corporations run this country. Period.  They make the decisions, the laws, decide what rights we have. The politicians are nothing more than  the personal hand-puppets of whatever corporation is currently shoving fistfulls of hundred-dollar-bills directly up their assholes.

<TEXT> Seriously? I thought that was low. For the humiliation this woman suffered. For how violated she must feel. For her trauma. For what has been taken from her that she will never get back. And to send a message so that the next time it happens it isnt you or your mother or your wife or your infant daughter. People, whether under color of law or not, just cant be allowed to do whatever they decide. If I'm allowed to violate your grandmother just because I'm a potato head with a badge then whats to stop me from determining that maybe a toddler is suit-casing an eightball of coke. Imagine if that dog had signaled on a small child. What would have happened then? Same night, same group of people working, same dog, except its a child thats suspected. Its a child thats strip-searched while people watch. Its a child handcuffed and taken to the hospital and violated even more, again, while people watch. Thats where I get a hundred million. To send a message. Probably wouldnt happen again if someone had to pay enormously.

I could almost get it if it were just one person, but this was probably a dozen or more people. A few feds, a few supervisors, a couple of receptionists, a few nurses, and a few doctors. UNBELIEVABLE that none of them thought "ummm wait guys...is this really necessary? Is it really ok to do this?" Other than the victim, no one protested? And these are the people we have protecting our borders, carrying loaded guys? Really?  And the medical staff? Seriously? Sorry, I realize this isnt Craigslist Rants and Raves, but DAMN!  </TEXT>

How come that didnt happen? I can understand one person, poorly trained and dimwitted, but how about the others? A coworker, and then another coworker, and then others, and then ultimately doctors and nurses. That seems like a total breakdown of the system. No one gave a damn about this woman.

<TEXT> Still, I've noticed that soda in general, regardless of the container, loses its fizz/carbonation within a day or two max when opened and then resealed and stored. This wasn't the case 35 years ago. At least I think I'm right. 

I'll try this in askscience...thanks </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not a big soda drinker, but I was as a kid, and I remember opening a two-liter and having it last for days. That was 30-35 years ago. I opened a two-liter of Dr Pepper and Mtn Dew last night for a kids birthday party, poured 2 cups from each, and resealed them immediately. Today they are worthless. Something similar happened a few weeks ago. So what gives? </TEXT>

I had to fire a fellow IT professional and was forced to think about it from the malicious point of view- how would I get into this network and screw it up if I wanted? I was also fired from a great sysadmin job about ten years ago. Although I had no malicious intent I knew exactly what precautions my boss was taking probably even before I was fired...and it hurt. The loss of trust is what hurt the most...besides my wallet. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The secret is this: there is no secret.  I am 40 years old since my late twenties I have been waking up between 4-430am every morning, weekdays AND weekends, WITHOUT AN ALARM CLOCK, and I love it. My secret is this- once I realize I'm awake I IMMEDIATELY get up out of bed and start my day NO MATTER HOW FEEL, and especially if I dont want to. I like to remind my body that I am the one in control. One of the reasons I think this works is because I absolutely LOVE life and am excited to see what the new day is going to bring! Anything could happen today! I could write a reddit post that maybe read by 5-10 people today or maybe I will meet someone new and funny or maybe I will make my coworkers laugh..or maybe it'll be something bigger. So, my answer is love life, be genuinely curious and excited for each day!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is one of the best audiobooks I have ever read (yes I use the term 'read' to describe listening to an audiobook). The narrator, RC Bray, really does a great job painting the scenes. This is a great time to get an Audible account! I have been a member for about a year and have never regretted it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> That reminds me of a story an ER nurse told me once. A gentleman walked into the ER holding a weight-plate with a coat draped over it in front of him. His penis was stuck, erect, in a 25lb plate with a round hole in the center, used for weightlifting on a barbell. The gentleman's penis had become erect once inserted into the hole and had gotten stuck in the plate. It was standard sized, not olympic, I assume. Anyway, the ER staff worked for a while trying to lube-up his penis, then trying to encourage the blood to flow out of his erect penis, but it was no use. Eventually, a surgeon "filleted his penis with a blade" to drain the blood. I will never forget that story.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure there's a joke here. My wife gave me the pack of Finger Spies that she picked up at the Dollar Store. When she handed them to me I said "Oh you know what I'm doing with these, right?" She replied, "Sadly, I know EXACTLY what you're going to do with them!" Without actually saying so, we were both referring to me placing the Finger Spies onto my penis and taking pics. Just like I did with the tiny top hot I found in the floor of the public library. Long story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry for the length. This really stuck with me...
"Apollonius of Tyana reads your future" from The Circus of Dr Lao

"Tomorrow will be like today, and day after tomorrow will be like the day before yesterday," said Apollonius. "I see your remaining days each as quiet, tedious collections of hours. You will not travel anywhere. You will think no new thoughts. You will experience no new passions. Older you will become but not wiser. Stiffer but not more dignified. Childless you are, and childless you shall remain. Of that suppleness you once commanded in your youth, of that strange simplicity which once attracted a few men to you, neither endures, nor shall you recapture any of them any more. People will talk to you and visit with you out of sentiment or pity, not because you have anything to offer them. Have you ever seen an old cornstalk turning brown, dying, but refusing to fall over, upon which stray birds alight now and then, hardly remarking what it is they perch on? That is you. I cannot fathom your place in life's economy. A living thing should either create or destroy according to its capacity and caprice, but you, you do neither. You only live on dreaming of the nice things you would like to have happen to you but which never happen; and you wonder vaguely why the young lives about you which you occasionally chide for a fancied impropriety never listen to you and seem to flee at your approach. When you die you will be buried and forgotton, and that is all. The morticians will enclose you in a worm-proof casket, thus sealing even unto eternity the clay of your uselessness. And for all the good or evil, creation or destruction, that your living might have accomplished, you might just as well have never lived at all. I cannot see the purpose in such a life. I can see in it only vulgar, shocking waste."

"I thought you said you didn't evaluate lives," snapped Mrs. Cassan.

"I'm not evaluating; I'm only wondering. Now you dream of an oil well to be found on twenty acres of land you own in New Mexico. There is no oil there. You dream of some tall, dark, handsome man to come wooing you. There is no man coming, dark, tall, or otherwise. And yet you will dream on in spite of all I tell you; dream on through your little round of hours, sewing and rocking and gossiping and dreaming; and the world spins and spins and spins. Children are born, grow up, accomplish, sicken, and die; you sit and rock and sew and gossip and live on. And you have a voice in the government, and enough people voting the same way you vote could change the face of the world. There is something terrible in that thought. But your individual opinion on any subject in the world is absolutely worthless. No, I cannot fathom the reason for your existence."

"I didn't pay you to fathom me. Just tell me my future and let it go at that."

I have been telling you your future! Why don't you listen? Do you want to know how many more times you will eat lettuce or boiled eggs? Shall I enumerate the instances you will yell good-morning to your neighbor across the fence? Must I tell you how many more times you will buy stockings, attend church, go to moving picture shows? Shall I make a list showing how many more gallons of water in the future you will boil making tea, how many more combinations of cards will fall to you at auction bridge, how often the telephone will ring in your remaining years? Do you want to know how many more times you will scold the paper-carrier for not leaving your copy in the spot that irks you the least? Must I tell you how many more times you will become annoyed at the weather because it rains of fails to rain according to your wishes? Shall I compute the pounds of pennies you will save shopping at bargain centers? Do you want to know all that? For that is your future, doing the same small futile things you have done for the last fifty-eight years. You face a repetition of your past, a recapitulation of the digits in the adding machine of your days. Save only one bright numeral, perhaps: there was love of a sort in your past; there is none in your future."

"Well, I must say, you are the strangest fortuneteller I ever visited."

"It is my misfortune only to be able to tell the truth." </TEXT>

<TEXT> True Story.  When I first started working for a local police department I was also a local volunteer firefighter in a neighboring town and was very close friends with the fire chief and other officers on that FD.  One of the first (police) calls I remember was: we received several calls from young ladies reporting that as they exited a local gym they observed a man, standing outside his vehicle, masturbating openly and watching them.  I immediately recognized the vehicle description and license tag as that of my good friend and fire chief from my local volunteer fire dept!  I couldnt believe it!  He was married with children, active in the community, great guy, etc.  It was a very awkward situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sprint has turned against their customers.  There was a time when I could call in and easily have my issue resolved by a customer service rep, a time when dealing with Sprint wasn't a fucking nightmare.  But that time has passed.  True story: One of the phones on my account became inoperable.  So I purchased a used GS2 on craigslist.  I called to activate it, but was told I would have to activate it myself, online. I knew in advance that this would not work because I had tried it twice before.  I tried to explain it to customer service, but they insisted I do it online myself anyway.  So I tried.  And it failed. I called back.  I was told to go to a Sprint store and let the reps there do it.  So I did.  Only, the reps at the Sprint store had the same issue.  They called Sprint and were told to activate it online or take it to a Sprint store.  WHAT THE FUCK. THEY ARE THE SPRINT STORE.  Five hours of my time to activate a goddamn phone. This has happened to me 3 times over the course of two years..  I no longer recommend Sprint to my friends.

<TEXT> I know this is an old thread now, but I am answering anyway.  You speak of damaging the ring.  Most jewelers can take an unrecognizable ring and turn it back into better than before.  I have seen severely damaged and mangled rings be restored to excellent condition by the right jeweler.  I hope you got them removed in time and I hope you had them restored afterward.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are two Bojangles within 15 miles of where I live.  They are both consistently filthy, hire disrespectful workers and their equipment is constantly out of order.  Every month, several times there is a handwritten sign on the drive thru that says "drive thru broken come inside" or " soda machine broken come inside if you want soda."  They have hired a young girl who acts like she has overdosed on xanax everyday.  I like their food and keep giving them another chance, only to be let down over and over. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are very thoughtful, and your father is lucky to have you as a son.  

Have you considered an Android device? Here's why...

1.  There are apps for the blind and for the seeing impaired (links below).
2.  You can play any audio book on an Android device
3.  Google Play Books will read aloud any downloaded ebook (and its easy)
4.  The storage is expandable
5.  AFFORDABLE

I dont know if your father is completely blind or can see just a little, but there are apps for the seeing impaired and for the blind.  This might be a great idea if you are comfortable setting these up.  If you arent and are in VA I can recommend someone who can or someone in the Reddit community can help.

<TEXT> If Chris Kyle were here he would tell you about the time two idiots attempted to rob him at gun point while he was refueling his truck.  They both had pistols pointed at him.  He shot them both.  Here is a post by Marcus Luttrell describing the events.

http://pistol-forum.com/showthread.php?4934-Chris-Kyle-Story-as-told-by-Marcus-Luttrell

On a bitterly cold morning in early January of 2009, the war, in a sense, found Chris again. What happened to him not far from his home outside Dallas never made the news, since the town involved didnt want the publicity, but the incident certainly would have made national headlines had a reporter ever gotten a tip about it.

Chris was minding his own business, fueling his pickup truck at a gas station, when he found himself at gunpoint. Two men holding pistols demanded his truck. Law enforcement will usually advise you to give in to the criminal in a situation like this. And thats good advice. But Chris took another route. Very calmly and coolly, he sized up which of the men was handling his pistol more comfortably. He put his hands up and told them he was going to reach into the truck to get his keys. Then his hand went under his coat. From a waistband holster, he pulled his Colt 1911. Swinging the pistol under his left armpit, he gave each robber two .45 caliber Hydra-Shock hollow-points to the chest. By the time the cops responded to the 911 call from the terrified lady who had locked herself in a car behind Chriss truck, the matter was settled. Elapsed time: about ten seconds. The service stations security cameras caught the whole thing.

I pray for anyone whose life gets so desperate that he or she chooses to resort to a life of crime, but its hard to resist a little cold laughter all the same: I mean, how unlucky a dumbass do you have to be to target a random guy for felony armed assault and find out hes killed more people than smallpox?

<TEXT> "It really is a standard process."  No such thing.  No way would any knowledgeable law enforcement officer with any amount of common sense attempt such a foolish thing.  

"No such device could be attached to a person's neck." are you referring to some sort of receiver to detonate the explosives?  If so, you could not be more wrong.  Referring to am IED/bomb?  Still, you could not be more wrong.  Receivers are very easy to hide...and neck-bombs, well this aint the first.

If this entire conversation were about something not attached to a human, then I might agree with some of your statements....but that isnt what we are dealing with.  

Go back to your desk.

Now I AM being a dick.  I have worked around firearms and explosives for most of my life.  I was in the US Army and I was a sworn police officer for years.  You obviously have no idea what you're talking about.  Maybe you know something about physics...I dont know...but you have zero training dealing with explosives.  I doubt you've ever held a gun.

<TEXT> because you (not you specifically) do not know the outcome.  Its impossible to determine with 100% certainty what is going to happen.  This might be ok for certain other explosives, but not one attached to a human beings neck.  You cannot generalize homemade explosive devices.  Maybe the creator accounted for that somehow, maybe he will remotely detonate....too many 'what-ifs' involved to risk it.  

And please accept my apology.  I sounded like a dick.  I really thought you were trolling.  Sincerely.   </TEXT>

"standard defusing tactic for bombs"...all bombs are different...created by different people with different areas of expertise or interest.  The bomber didnt pick this thing up at Walmart and you dont detonate anything near a person, much less near their face or head.

He should also have recorded the date and time that his tuning forks were calibrated.  If you can show reasonable doubt that the officers equipment may not be working properly, then a judge cannot convict you.  That officer was half-ass at best.  He would have lost every case that day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know, right?  I am going to assume that Marlow pawned it to Prop Joe, for an insultingly low price, and then never paid off the pawn.  So Prop Joe sold it, at a nice profit, to the local pedo for use in the childrens bathroom at the elementary school.  

Later, a drunken McNaulty, somehow tracked it down and, after months of "off the clock" work, managed to make a federal case out of it despite his superiors orders that he drop it and return to the boat.

<TEXT> former police officer here. IF you want to be a cop, shop around.  The departments in my area hire you FIRST, then pay you full salary to go to the 18-week academy.  It seems unreasonable to do it any other way.  Of course, you have to sign a 2-year contract work for the agency that pays for your academy.  Starting pay here is average 35k, but you can totally make it on that salary here.  Get some some experience and then go wherever you want.  Its an awesome job!  Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> is this the uncle who touches you?  Just curious, because we all have at least one.  Anyway...this may infuriate you, but according to believers, of which I am one, YOU wouldnt he here if it were not for Him (God).  One logic behind the statement is that you couldnt possibly have made that life-saving observation had He not CREATED YOU.  So, yeah...'good on you' for calling it...but you didnt do it alone.

Its actually very similar to the story of Corinthians.  Paul was driving his rented mule through the streets of downtown Corinth when he was temporarily distracted by some street-whores.  This caused him to gallop right though a stop sign and nearly wreck into a bus carrying the local girls varsity volleyball team.  At the last minute, one of the girls on the bus noticed Paul, galloping full speed, toward them.  They were able to alert the driver, who was able to stop the bus and avoid what would have been a horrific accident, the likes of which downtown Corinth hasnt seen since the Wells Fargo mule crashed into the beer mule.

Apologies for the made-up story that wasnt near as funny as I thought it was. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Um.....what?  Your  post makes no sense at all..and I cant even believe I am commenting on it.  Dont get me wrong, I'm all for your right to just talk and talk and talk and bash whatever you want, but it needs to make sense.
 

The second sentence in your first paragraph, the one that begins with 'for example' is not an example at all of the "fake niceness" that you mention.   Being nice has nothing to do with faith that God will save your burning ass.

...and God doesnt tell Christians to "be happy."  The Bible does not mention that...anywhere at all.  "Thou shalt wear upon your face a smile to show all..blah blah...."  Nope, not in there.  Christians, along with everyone else on the planet, should be and are very concerned with whats happening in the world.  They arent pretending to be happy despite this.  Your post makes zero sense.

Also, FYI - Christians do not refuse to flee from burning buildings, they dont refuse to wear their seatbelts because of "Gods Will,"  they dont play Russian Roulette with 6 rounds in the chamber. 

My thoughts on this:  You need to form your own opinion, an educated one.  Stop listening to your cool friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> two dollars?  I never tip less than $5 when I dine in.  Its five bucks.  A two dollar tip almost seems like an insult to someone trying to make a living (to me at least).  

Also, there seem to be a lot of misconceptions among non-believers when it comes to what believers think and do.  You cant throw all believers into one basket and call them all the same, because they most certainly are not.  Maybe non-believers are all the same, I dont know, but believers range from robots who cant think for themselves to extremists (which is its own category with many levels) to just regular people who mind their business to everything in between.

Most believers who I know fall into the 'regular people who mind their business' category.  I feel like I speak for this 'group' when I say that we are disgusted and embarrassed by the extremists and hypocrites, the Jerry Falwells, the better-than-you's, the faith-healers and snake handlers, etc.  

Most churches arent like that.  I attend church regularly and I do not personally know anyone with the audacity to pass off a piece of paper with bible scripture on it as a tip.  These people are idiots and do not accurately represent the rest of us (believers).

<TEXT> This is my understanding and someone correct me if I am wrong.

The constitution protects us from unreasonable searches from law enforcement officers, but not necessarily private parties.  When you walk into a Walmart (or any private property), you are agreeing to abide by whatever ridiculous rules they want to make up.  Its PRIVATE PROPERTY and they can make up the rules in their house.  So can you in your house.  You cant just do whatever you want and then scream 'I HAVE RIGHTS.'  You do not have to shop at Walmart if you dont like their rules.  But if you enter their house, its probably a good idea to act appropriately.  If you dont like it, dont be there.  You came to them; they did not bring their rules to you.

Also, where are these rights that he referred to?: "my **right not to submit to a search by a private party** was respected, and Walmart's **right to detain suspected shoplifters for a reasonable amount of time** while awaiting a law enforcement officer for an investigation was also respected" </TEXT>

<TEXT> The license plate sort of blows his cover...

I saw this in the Christiansburg, VA Walmart parking lot.  At first glance I thought it was an actual Virginia State Police car parked in the handicap parking.  Turns out it WAS a VSP car, taken out of service and auctioned off.  The new owner added the bumper guard and antennas so it still looks REAL....the license plate sort of blows his cover... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did.  The letter I received from the insurance company was in response to my doctors letter.  Its a well-known fact that insurance companies are crooks.  They are.  Its a fact.  I have done everything within my power to encourage them to pay for the medicine.  I have followed every procedure.  There is nothing else I can do, except for pay out-of-pocket.

On a related note, my mother pays for her own health insurance.  She has no major health problems, but pays $800 per month for coverage that doesnt cover anything!  She has a high copay, and still the insurance only covers a small percentage of office visits and medicine.  She is constantly receiving bills from doctors and labs for the balance that the insurance didnt pay.  They blatantly rip her (and millions like her) off every month and then laugh about it and post record profits.  It is my wish to see anyone and everyone associated with the health insurance business to be out of a fucking job.  I know that sounds harsh and unrealistic, but they have done nothing besides screw me and my family.

Additionally, doctors and other health care providers have to fight for every penny they receive from insurance companies.  I have had more than one doctor tell me that its such a hassle, that they almost dont even want to fuck with it.  They submit claims and are routinely denied.   So they have to submit them a second time.  Then, finally, after months and months, they see a little money.  

If you think insurance companies are anything but crooks, then you must live in a cave.  The proof is right there, everyday.  Its impossible to NOT know this. </TEXT>

Oh, and they're all fucking crooks, so capitalism doesnt really apply.  I can get ass-raped by one or switch to another and get throat-fucked.  Thanks anyway.    </TEXT>

The last time I shopped at BB, I was eavesdropping on the Geek Squad kiosk area as one of their village idiots informed an elderly woman that her grandsons laptop would cost over $100 to repair.  As soon as she left the store, I informed her that I would fix the machine FOR FREE at my shop if she would retrieve it from Best Buy.  She showed up at my store the next day and I fixed his machine in minutes using the recovery partition.  True story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dont understand why this is seen by atheists as some sort of victory.  These types of Christians are going to do whatever it is that they're going to do.  None of it requires a counter move.  In fact, responding to it almost legitimizes it.  We already know what they're going to do.  It seems juvenile to me and I feel like it gives atheists a juvenile association.

<TEXT> Yes and no.  Its more complicated than that.  Of course I would fear the eminent judgment of God, but I dont have to fear it....because I already know that I am forgiven.

Your scenario doesnt work either...'hurt someone' is too general.  'Paid my debt to society' implies that I broke some sort of law.  Did I call someone a dick eater or did i punch someone in the mouth or did i murder someone?

If you are trying to pick apart my beliefs you are wasting your time.  I will be the first to tell you that my beliefs are not reasonable.  How can you pick apart a statement that I would defend with 'it just is.'  It cant be done.  

Notice a reversal of roles here.  I am not trying to convince you that your beliefs are wrong.  You can believe what you want as far as I am concerned.  I am the one forced to defend my beliefs......

<TEXT> Do you really have to ask that?...oh..and I will concede that you are right that I posted in /r/atheist.  I actually just responded to the post when it was on the front page and it didnt occur to me where it was located (stupid, I know).  I would not have knowingly trespassed....but now that I have, I am somewhat disappointed by the impression that a representative of a group who claims to be peaceful and easygoing has left on me....you are no different from those who you consider your polar opposite.

Anyway, to answer your question in the simplest way possible, I always ask for forgiveness when I do something that I feel goes against what I have been taught.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, I dont think the statement 'atheists are uniformily hated and dispised in every community' is correct at all' (and not just because uniformily and dispised are misspelled).  There are some hardcore, extremists who hate you, but the majority of Christians (at least the ones who I know) are like the majority of atheists: just want to be left alone.  I will use myself as an example.  I live a happy life and do whatever the fuck I want (I inserted the fuck in there as proof).  I am currently living in sin with a beautiful girl who is 4 years younger than me and I probably wont marry her.  I think being a Christian is what lets me do these things.  I dont have to be perfect.  I can fuck upand believe me, I fuck up.  The only difference is..and this is the part you hate for some reason, I ask forgiveness when I fuck up and I believe that some higher power grants me this forgiveness.  I dont push this on you and  I dont judge anyoneever.  I have gay friends.  I also have atheist friends, with whom I have had some awesome and fun conversations about our beliefs.  They didnt take it personally and neither should you.unless youre just one of those people who take everything personally (and it sounds like you are), in which case  you mention dicks so often that you must have one in your mouth.   </TEXT>

I dont even think she lost her temper.  She spoke to him appropriately according to the severity of his offense.  She was rightly appalled at his audacity. In a real court, where presumably this man hopes to practice one day, he would have easily been in contempt.  Its common sense, although you wouldnt know it from reading the comments here, that inside a courtroom the judge is God.  What he says goes.  If anyone thinks any different then you are in for a rude awakening one day.  I have been in court more times than I can count; you are expected to act and dress appropriately, with the utmost respect ever for the legal institution, whether you like it or not.  Judge Milan was right and the man was lucky that his only punishment was public humiliation. </TEXT>

Dump the entire contents of the Androgel into a saucepan.  Squat over saucepan, dipping your raisin sack into the gel.  Hold this position for 1 hour.  Repeat daily until you are no longer getting your ass kicked by girls.

<TEXT> If you are referring to the facts, as creationists see them, then there IS nothing new.  An event occurred long ago. There really are no new facts to 'come up with.' 

I realize that reddit is the main vehicle for your cause, and there would be no 'in your face!!' without it, but even the front page of the Scientology site changes from time to time.  You (and I dont mean you specifically) post the same 4-5 links/comics/whatever over and over as if you've discovered something new (and other atheists, I presume, upvote just for the in your face factor.  I am nearly certain that I can hear you screaming 'EUREKA' and IN YOUR FACE JESUS! from here.

It seems that atheism is the one constant rerun here, and while I have enjoyed the 4 atheism-related posts (for their humor and scientific value) I think the reddit community deserves something new.  

Diluting the front page of reddit with the same links over and over seems a little desperate.

Interesting how non-believers, who constantly complain that Christians dont mind their own business, are so upset over this woman thinking God.  I have read many posts, from non-believers, about Christians always stepping in uninvited and doing their 'Christian' thing, but here's an example of a non-believer overhearing a woman thinking God and then immediately running to tattle to the reddit communuty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had to put my best friend down last summer.  Her name was Bob and she was a 17-year-old black lab..with cancer.  She and I grewup together and she was always there protecting me and just being a friend. I felt like I was tricking her when I asked her if she 'wanted to go for a ride' that day. Once in the vets office, he shaved her wrist, drew up a red liquid into a syringe, and injected it while I held her.  She was very calm except for one instant when she flinched and looked at me.  I continued to stroke her and tell her I loved her until she was gone.  I didnt think I would cry, but I did.  I carried her through the full waiting room in my arms in her favorite sleeping bag with tears silently streaking down my face.  Once home, I dug a hole in my back yard and buried her there.  There are flowers on her grave. </TEXT>

Thats pretty funny.

Theres this old man who has lived alone in the mountains for years.  Well he gets tired of not getting laid so dusts off his clothes and goes to the nearest bar in the nearest town.  He sits at the bar and the bartender asks, Whatll it be?

The mountain replies, Ill have a bottle of whisky and the best woman youve got!

The bartender says, Well heres your whiskey sir, but um.we dont have any women.

No women? says the man, What the hell do you do for fun?

Well, says the bartender, Weve got that long haired cook in the back.

Oh hell no! says the mountain man I dont go for that shit!

So he takes his bottle and goes back into the mountains.  Time passes.  He decides to give town another try.  So he dusts off his clothes and goes to the nearest bar in the nearest town.

He sits at the bar and the bartender asks, Whatll it be?

The mountain replies, Ill have a bottle of whisky and the best woman youve got!

The bartender says, Well heres your whiskey sir, but um.we still dont have any women.

No women? says the man, What the hell do you do for fun now?

Well, says the bartender, Weve still got that long haired cook in the back.

Oh hell no! says the mountain man I dont go for that shit!

So the mountain man takes his whiskey and goes back into the mountains again.  And time passes.  And the mountain man is lonely.  So he goes back into town to the nearest bar.

He sits at the bar and the bartender asks, Whatll it be?

The mountain replies, Ill have a bottle of whisky and the best woman youve got!

The bartender says, Well heres your whiskey sir, but um.we still dont have any women.

No women? says the man, What the hell do you do for fun around here now?

Well, says the bartender, Weve got that long haired cook in the back.

Oh hell no! says the mountain man I dont go for that shit!

So the mountain man sits at the bar and drinks his whiskey and thinks.  He yells for the bartender to come over.  Yes says the bartender.  Suppose I was to do it with that long-haired cookhow many people would know?

Well says the bartender, About six people.

Holy shit says the mountain man six people, hows that?

Well says the bartender Me and you and him of course..and the three people it takes to hold him down because he dont go for that shit either.
