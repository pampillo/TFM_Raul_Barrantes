<TEXT> I run a Jewellery company and its really tough. We did a market at the weekend and we sell fun rings for kids. A little boy bought a mario  ring and his dad bought him a pikachu one. He put one on each middle finger and ran around having adventures and making them talk to each other. It was so sweet and he was so happy it made me remember why I love what I do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Five minutes earlier...

"So are we all in agreement?"

"Are you serious? This is a joke. She doesn't even own a car. Have you seen her bank balance? No way. Count me out" said Wealth. He slammed his fist on the table. 

Charity snorted. "Look how the last few winners turned out. It's time for a change around here. Your Ferrari club is over."

"You two stop it. This is serious." They looked at the floor.

"But just look at her daughter's face... She raised her, she adores her" cried Family, holding back tears. "Alone." Said Tradition with a disapproving cough. Faith shook her head, "through no fault of her own, she was abandoned. She is a wonderful mother and deserves to win. Look at all the good she's done, the children she has inspired, the lives she has changed".

Logic pulled out his spreadsheet. "She's directly impacted 2172 people positively. 716 by a life changing degree. Indirectly, we're talking tens of thousands. And her negative metrics are the lowest we've seen in decades." 

Love smiled, "she has a wonderful heart and she's shown love to so many." Fame frowned "I understand, I do, but she's barely more than a well known community figure. Is her impact global? I don't think so".

Truth looked at the others, "the clock's ticking folks".

They looked around the table, shuffling papers, photographs, newspaper cuttings. 

Wisdom cleared her throat. "Though she is only one person, if everyone was like her, the world be a better place". "She's basically carbon neutral!" Nature interjected. "As I was saying, her kindness, gentleness and encouragement have had a life changing impact on those around her. Her work with children and vulnerable people have reduced reoffending, increased education levels, improved wellbeing and brought about a much higher level of hope. In one of the poorest and most dangerous areas in her country. She is brave, determined and she has stood up for justice. In my humble opinion, she's won."

"Well that's that then." 

Three of them left the room. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got married at 20 which is younger than a lot of people have said but it was the best thing ever for us. We'd already lived together for a year, and we'd done long distance before that and we just work together. I'd say if you know that you always have each others backs and are ready to commit to each other for life then age isn't really an issue. My grandma was 18 when she got married and her and my grandad are still totally in love 50 years later. </TEXT>

Often owners are really picky about who has their puppies which is a good sign! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't see how, I'm not an expert on gun control, I doubt many of us are but I don't think that weapons designed to kill humans have any place in everyday life. Knives, axes - most other things used as a weapon have another purpose (cooking, chopping wood). Guns don't (apart from killing animals which I also don't agree with). And the number of massacres, murders and suicides associated with guns in America could possibly prevented by not having guns - I'm sure there are exceptions but the idea of going to the supermarket to buy a deadly weapon isn't going to help. I just don't see any valid reason for them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Me and my mum made one for my cousin and loved it! Some ideas - carpet stores give away samples so use them for carpets. Also wallpaper samples but make sure you use a small pattern. Get hold of some paint tester pots if you want to paint things. We used fabric scraps for curtains and bedding. Oh and wooden blocks with details drawn on them (like jobs on top of an oven) for the kitchen (then it can be moved around and reorganised). I'll see if I have any photos but have fun!!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a small heart balloon on my arm from the banksy piece "there is always hope". I have a big sun on my back as the sun always comes up no matter how shit everything seems (I had this a few months after a long difficult stay in hospital). And I have Rex from toy story on my leg with the quote "you've just got to believe in yourself". For me my tattoos are little messages to myself. They're eclectic but I love them and I have my next one planned for soon.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like William brown street. the world museum is worth a visit - it's got an aquarium, a planetarium as well as all kinds of historical and animal exhibits. Next to it is central library which is amazing and if you go to the top floor and see the whole city. Next to that is the walker art gallery which is beautiful and has some great pieces. They're all free too. Other fun places - Albert Dock, st Luke's, the bluecoat, Chinatown, bold street - there's plenty to see! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd agree with the other comments - it's important to stay true to who you are and be comfortable. If you want to try out different styles and find out what else you're comfortable in - go for it. Sometimes it's even harder to make friends and meet people if you're uncomfortable in what you're wearing, and you're not being true to yourself. But figuring out who you are takes a lifetime so try out as many styles as you like!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So ecosia is a search engine that plants a tree every time you search, it makes money in the same way Google does but it all goes on trees. Charity miles is an app that pairs you with a corporate sponsor who will donate to your chosen charity dependant on how much you do (a bit like a charity fun run). Sharethemeal is an app from the UN (I think) that lets you give spare change amounts towards feeding hungry people. If you do a bit of research there's some really cool ways you can give to charity from your mobile  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a lot of it is just jumping in. You'd be surprised at how little money you actually have to spend. Creative thinking, organic growth and hard, hard work were crucial. If you're flexible and find opportunities and say yes to everything you can start making money pretty quickly. I used savings for rent/food and invested time in the business. We have 2 incomes as my other half works which is obviously very helpful. We may not have gone out for dinner but I love what I do and with minimum spending the business became cash positive pretty soon! </TEXT>
