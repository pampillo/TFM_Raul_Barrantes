<TEXT> How great was the battle scenes? They were on par with Saving Private Ryan, particularly it's sound design. My theatre nearly vibrated the first battle scene. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get what you mean, and maybe I didn't explain it myself as well, but I mean Arrival contains aliens, which, like you said, is pure sci-fi, but it takes place in the present, there's nothing futuristic looking about the movie, other than the aliens, there's nothing that makes you say it's sci-fi. While, Blade Runner 2049 is cyberpunk, it's still a setting that instantly makes you say sci-fi, with it's futuristic setting and technology which is futuristic, and plus, the movie's about replicants, androids who look lifelike with a 4 year capacity, and while there is androids, I'm pretty sure there's no androids that are completely lifelike. You get what I mean, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My 3 Most Anticipated Movies of 2017 is:
1. Dunkirk: A WW2 movie by my favorite director of all time, Christopher Nolan? Do I have to explain? And the cast looks amazing, and, unlike other people, I'm quite interested in Harry Styles in the movie, despite hating One Direction.
2. Baby Driver: Edgar Wright is my second favorite director, and my favorite comedy director, as I love his style of humor, but apparently this film is a bit more dramatic, which, although, I would love to see another comedy, I'm excited to see anything he does. Plus, Kevin Spacey plays a crime boss in an Edgar Wright movie. Do I need to say any more?
3. Blade Runner 2049: I love the original, love the director and the cinematographer, Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins, and I love the cast, and plus, this is the first hardcore sci-fi movie (Arrival has sci-fi elements, but it's not hardcore sci-fi) that could possibly win Best Picture, which is pretty exciting in itself.
There's my list.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In an interview, Edgar Wright said the film is less of a comedy, and more of an intense action thriller. While personally, I was hoping it would be a full-on comedy like his films normally are, but I'm keen for anything by Edgar Wright, since he's my second favourite filmmaker (first is Christopher Nolan) </TEXT>
