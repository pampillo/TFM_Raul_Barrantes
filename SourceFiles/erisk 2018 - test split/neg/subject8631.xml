<TITLE> A Site Called "Cash for Confessions" Has Changed My Life </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 17:12:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Im not usually the type of person to click on ads, but I was completely broke and still living with my parents. Before a bunch of you guys come at me and tell me to get a job and to stop being a bum. I want you guys to know. I do have a job. I work 55 hours a week and I give all of my money to my parents. They are the ones that dont have enough to pay their bills. After everything is said and done, I have maybe 40 dollars a month to spend on myself. Fuck, they are my parents, but I make sure they have enough to eat before I feed myself. 

That is why when I saw a simple black square take up the bottom right corner of my screen with the words Cash for Confessions inside of the box I clicked it. I was using an old beat up tablet and hooked up to really shitty Wi-Fi coming from the modem and router Comcast rents out to us, but the site opened up on my tablet in an instant.

Like I said, Im not normally the type of person to click on ads so my guard was up high, but the website seemed completely safe. It was pretty much solid white with a small tan box in the middle of the screen. On the box were two generic words. **Create Account** I quickly made a throwaway e-mail address and clicked on the box. It took me to the next screen. It only asked me for three things.

*User Name*

*E-mail Address*

*Currency Desired*

My favorite superhero is Flash so I made my username BarryFlash, I typed in my e-mail address, and then typed in USD on the last slot. As soon as I finished typing the screen turned black. It stayed that way for a couple of seconds before two words appeared on the top of screen. ***Thank You.*** The two words faded away and were replaced by a series of rules.

***Cash for Confessions***

**1) All of the confessions must be completely true.**

**2) Do not use the money to help others out. This is your money that you have earned.**

**3) You may tell others about Cash for Confessions, but you cannot send this into anyone that will cause us any type of trouble.**

I impatiently tapped on the screen until the screen flashed a completely white screen before transitioning to a gray screen. An endless list of confessions filled my screen. I wasnt really interested in anyone elses confessions. I wanted to see if this thing actually paid us. After a couple of seconds of searching around I finally found what I was looking for. 

Once you click this you must confess.

Without a second thought, I tapped on the link the other confessions disappeared from the screen and was replaced by an empty white box. I tapped on the box and my keyboard came up on my screen.

After a small sigh of anticipation, I typed out I was a virgin till I was 22 years old. Right after I finished typing the keyboard disappeared and the screen went completely black. I waited for a couple of seconds before the tablet vibrated. After a couple more seconds of waiting, I pressed the power button and my tablet came to life. There was a new e-mail. I tapped on the notification and the e-mail app came up and slowly started to load. 

I almost let out a scream of joy when I saw that the e-mail was from Cash for Confessions. I tapped on the e-mail and quickly became sketched out and slightly pissed when all it said was, $15 has been deposited into your bank account. If you would like more money please give us a better confession.

Shit. I would have been happy with just $15, but I knew that there was no way they could have deposited the money into my bank. They didnt have my account number, they didnt even know what bank I used, shit, they didnt even know my name. After letting out a depressed groan, I turned my tablet off and went to sleep. 

I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of my tablet vibrating continuously. Once I got out of bed, I nervously walked up to my tablet and turned on my tablet. E-mails. Thousands of e-mails from Cash for Confessions. I nervously clicked on the first e-mail and almost dropped it on the ground. I closed out of the e-mail and looked through the rest. They all said the same thing.

*Dont doubt us, Samuel Harrison. We know who you are. We gave you the money. Please check your bank account and see that we are a legitimate business. We miss you and we hope you come back.*

Curious and scared out of my mind, I clicked on my bank app and logged in. I had 14 cents in my bank account before (I checked earlier to see if I could eat Taco Bell the next day) but I now had $15.14. I was scared. I really was, but I was also excited. I mean, it was the first opportunity I was given to actually make a little pocket change for myself.

I dont really know when I fell asleep, but I do know the sun was rising when I finally did. I kept writing out confession after confession. I mean, they knew who I was, but the people that were reading it had no idea who I was. All they saw were my confessions. I didnt really put anything juicy, but a couple of them managed to make me around 30 dollars. That was 4 days ago. 

I woke up the next morning and realized I was already 4 hours late to work. I dont know why I was so dumb, but I called my manager and told him that I quit. In the middle of his rant, I hung up on him and checked my bank account. My jaw dropped when I saw that $1560.14 in my bank account. 

For the next three days, I wrote as many of my confessions as I could, but yesterday morning I realized something. I was out of things to confess. 

That is when I started to mess up my entire life in the span of 24 hours. I broke one of the rules. I started to make up confessions.

It started off with small shit like I stole 100 dollars out of my grandmas wallet when I was 12. and quickly escalated to I have a gun in my drawer. I am going to kill my parents tonight and they wont be able to do anything about it.

Right after I made that confession I checked my e-mails. A couple of my made up confessions made in between 15 dollars to 750 dollars, but my newest one made me $15,000. 

I was ecstatic. Everything finally felt like it was perfect, but about an hour later, my tablet started blowing up again. Nervously, I checked it and saw that I had over 800 e-mails waiting for me. I opened the first one and instantly knew how bad I fucked up. I knew they all said the same thing, but I spent the next hour clicking through all of the e-mails and checking to see if it was maybe just a warning. It wasnt. They all said the same thing again.

**Samuel,**

**Why would you lie to us? You knew we would figure out if you were lying or not, but there is a way to fix it. If you look in your first drawer you will see a gun. Kill your parents if you want to live. Fulfill the confession or we take your worthless life.**

I checked my drawer, and sure enough, the gun was in the middle of my drawer. I picked it up and felt goose bumps cover my body. 

When my parents sat on the couch for our weekly movie night I took the gun downstairs. I sat next to them for the last time. I enjoyed every single second, every single laugh at dumb moments from the movie, and every single smile we gave each other. 

As the movie ended I took the gun out of the back of my pants. Tears filled my eyes as I knew what I needed to do. 

I placed the gun behind me and ran out the front door. I didnt look back at them. I didnt want to see their confused and concerned faces as I ran off into the night. 

I went to my friends house that night. I knew I was putting him at risk, but I was honestly hoping they would kill my friend and me off, but unfortunately, I woke up this morning. I woke up and saw my friend cooking breakfast. With a feeling of dread and sadness, I turned on his tv and turned it to the news.

The main story was about my parents. They were found in our house. Both of their heads were mutilated by several bullets. I choked back my tears and sobs. I know they are after me now. 

Im writing this out on my tablet and leaving it at my friends house while I try to get as far away as possible. Its my fault that my parents are dead, but it is now up to me. Its up to me to get revenge for their deaths. 

Until then. I want to leave you guys a warning.

Please be careful if you use Cash for Confessions. It is fine if you need a bit of money, but please dont be like me. Dont [make up confessions.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TITLE> Don't Trust The Bath Bombs From Ugly Duckling Project </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-07 17:12:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I walked into the hospital an extremely attractive man two days ago. I am now a lump of decaying flesh. The doctors have no idea what could have caused it, but I do. Telling them wouldnt help anything. I mean. They already know the important details. I have thousands of tiny parasites eating me from the outside. They even managed to get two of them off of my body, but the more they examined the parasites the more confused and scared the doctors and I have gotten.

The doctor gave me a description of what they look like about 2 hours ago. They have worm-like bodies, but the face of the parasite has a lot of similarities to. Um. To yours. Both of them. I dont really know how else to describe it. No arms but small limbs that resemble legs and. Well. Feet. Thats all they really told me, but they will continue to examine them and hopefully find a way to get them off of you. For now. Just relax.

I really tried relaxing for an hour, but every time I stopped completely moving I could feel those things go in and out of my flesh. That is why I decided the most productive thing I could do now is to give everyone a warning. 

So I dont really know how I should start my introduction, but I guess I could just act like Im talking to you. 

So hi!

My name is Chris. I am a 28-year-old man. I live in a two bedroom house and when Im not dying on a hospital bed I am spending most of my day at the small Italian restaurant I own. I have two cats that I love very much. I live in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Never been a really attractive person, but I was far from ugly. Of course, I wished I was the guy that made people take double takes, but I knew that was completely impossible when I couldnt even afford the most basic plastic surgeries. 

That all changed 9 days ago. 

It was around 1 in the afternoon when I heard a knock at my door. Slightly annoyed by the unknown visitor, I let out a sigh and walked to my front door and looked through the peephole. A woman was standing patiently outside. Even from the peephole, I could tell that this woman was fucking gorgeous. I straightened out my clothes and my hair and opened the door.

With the first glance, I was awestruck. She was the most attractive person I have ever seen in my life. With a confident smile, she stuck out her hand and said, Hello sir. Have you ever heard of Ugly Duckling Project? Slightly confused and curious, I shook my head at her and asked, Um no, but Im not really trying to buy anything ri- She cut me off and said, Oh no. Im actually going around and giving people one week trials! I dont even have anything to take payments. With a quick motion, she took out a ball the size of a baseball and stuck it out to me. I took it and looked at it. 

After giving me a second to look at the multi-colored ball, she continued to speak, Thats a bath bomb. Have you heard of those? Well. They basically go into the bath and slowly they dissolve into the water. Its a lot of fun to watch as well as making your bath smell a lot better, but ours are different. If you just use the ones I give you for a week I can promise you that you will look like someone I would drool over. She took out a small box and handed it to me along with the bath bomb that was in her hand.

I took it and nodded at her. 

Before she left she said, Use the bath bomb I gave you first and then use the other ones. You will see a change within the first day. Its important you dont go past 30 hours before using the next bath bomb or else it will stop working. Ill be back next week. You can place your order with me and then take me out to dinner after. 

Im normally not a bath kind of guy, but curiosity got the better of me that night. I threw in the bath bomb and got in. 

She was right. The bath bomb was nice to watch. It dissolved and slightly fizzed in the water. Blue and red foams started to cover the top of the bath. I leaned back and relaxed. I woke back up a couple of minutes later and it felt like I had bugs all over my face. No matter how many times I rubbed my face the feeling of having something crawling all over my face didnt stop. Out of desperation I threw the bath water on my face and tried washing it off.

It finally stopped. I quickly dried myself off and checked the bathroom mirror. 

Nothing changed, but I wasnt really that disappointed. I mean. She almost had me. Of course, she would use her beauty to seduce me into taking the trial and hopefully convince me into making a purchase by giving me the sliver of hope that I could take her out on a date. 

I went to sleep that night around 11 pm. 

When I woke up the next morning I checked my alarm clock and realized that I completely overslept. It was already 8:45 and my restaurant opened at 9. I rushed out my house and drove as quickly as I could to the restaurant. When I got there I rushed out of my car and opened the doors. As soon as I got opened the doors I felt someone tap on my shoulder.

It was one of the waitresses. With a small cough, she asked, Um do you know Chris? I never got the memo that someone else would be opening today. 

I let out a laugh and said, Cmon Stacy. I know I didnt have enough time to get ready today, but that joke is a bit harsh. Her mouth dropped as well as the other six employees. They rushed inside except one of the cooks. He looked at me for a second before saying, Sheesh man. You look like a fucking model now. How did you do it? That must have cost a fortune. I gave him a confused look and ran to the restroom. I stared at myself in the mirror for over 2 minutes. I couldnt help it. I was now the best looking guy I have ever seen. I still looked like myself, but shit, the perfect version of myself.

The rest of the week was a blur. I did the bath bomb every single day at the same time. I didnt get any better looking, but I still felt somewhat obligated to continue using them.

Before I knew it, it was the next week. I took the day off so I could wait for the lady to come back and I could place my order. 

She came at around 1 in the afternoon again. I opened the door and she didnt even bat an eye. With a smile, she said, So I know for a fact you used them. Good. Im not drooling like I promised, but I would really like it if you could take me out to dinner, but first, you need to place your order. I gave her a nod and asked, So how much is it? Without skipping a beat she said, Well for a week its $14,000 and for a month its $50,000. I recommend the month because you save $6,000. 

My jaw dropped. I didnt even have enough to pay for a week. Shit. I didnt even have $5,000 in the bank. I shook my head and said, Im going to be honest with you. Im happy with what I have now. Besides, I dont even have close to that amount. I was just going to buy more so I could take you out on that date. With a sigh, she said, Are you sure you cant buy anymore? I highly recommend not skipping a day. I mean. You know that the looks will only be maintained with those bath bombs. I shook my head once again and said, Like I said, I dont have close to the amount to pay for a weeks worth. Shit. I own a restaurant, but I make just enough to pay the bills and have around 2 grand a month to spend on myself. 

She gave me the saddest look I have ever seen and said before leaving, You need to know. The first bath bomb is filled with tiny parasites. They eat away the impurities of a person. The other bath bombs after that give those parasites enough mock flesh to feed off of for around 30 hours. Once they run out of the mock flesh they will start to eat the rest of your flesh. 

I dont know why, but I laughed at her. I mean, at that time, it was completely ludicrous, but I shouldnt have doubted what she said. 

She gave me a final sad look before handing me a bath bomb. 

Before she walked away she said, This bath bomb is the same as the first. For when you want a quick death. 

That was three days ago. 

The next day I woke up and saw patches of exposed flesh all around my body. I didnt feel pain, but I could feel those little creatures traveling inside of me constantly. 

I rushed to the hospital. 

Like I said earlier, the doctors havent found a solution for me. I know there isnt a solution. 

Well, there is one last solution. 

I asked the nurse to bring in the bath bomb that was in the left pocket of my hoodie. 

Luckily, she found it and brought it in.

Once I send this warning out to you guys I am going to eat this fucking bath bomb. Its going to taste gross, but I want it to end now. There isnt any hope for me anymore, but there is hope for you. If anyone asks you if you know about the Ugly Duckling Project walk away from them or shut the fucking [door in their face.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TITLE> My Mother Really Knows Best </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Did you have enough to eat? Are you sure you studied enough for the test? Have you practiced the guitar, piano, and trumpet for an hour each tonight? Do you have any updates on your test scores? 


Those would be the starter questions my mother would ask me every night. If I couldnt say yes to every single question, I would have to stay up a little later and finish whatever task I did not complete. 


It annoyed me greatly at the time, but now that I am 25 and live around 3 hours away from my mother, I am forever grateful for how she treated me. I did not graduate college or start a business, but I was the general manager of a store that generated around 2.5 million dollars a year. I made enough to live somewhat luxuriously, and that was all thanks to all of the times my mother made sure I had every single task completed. 


For my age, I have accomplished a lot. I was making 4 times I thought I would ever make in a year with my job. I was dating a girl that was absolutely perfect to me. Her name was Carolyn, and I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this funny, sweet, caring, and fiery woman. She had beautiful short brown hair, eyes that changed colors, and a face that made me smile every time she walked by my side. I loved her, and I knew that I wanted to marry her. 


That is why when my mother gave me a phone call and asked if she could move in with me, I said, Yeah! Just give me a call when you get close to my house. She let out a sigh of relief and hung up the phone without saying another word to me. 


My girlfriend was living with me at the time, but I really thought she wouldnt have any sort of problem living with my mother. I mean, even when I told my girlfriend that my mother was coming to live with us for a while she just gave me a smile and told me that I was a good son. I also knew my mother would be excited I found a woman so perfect for me.


My mother came to my house two days ago. Carolyn and I were watching a movie on the tv when I got a call from my mother. She told me that she was around 30 minutes away. It was 8 pm, but I didnt care. I was excited. I wanted my mother to see how happy and successful I was, but when my mother walked into my house she immediately started talking about how dirty my house was. I tried telling her that we werent expecting her to come so soon, but with a glare, she said, This isnt how I raised you. You used to be such an obedient and good child. Now you are some rebellious punk.


I gave her a small laugh and showed her to our spare bedroom. She started unloading her luggage in her room and I walked back out to the living room. Carolyn looked at me with a face of concern, but with a reassuring hand on her shoulder, I told her that my mother would quickly get used to our house. She gave me a small nod and walked to our room. I called out to her to tell her that the movie wasnt over yet, but she ignored me and continued to walk into our room. 


Yes. My feelings were hurt, but I knew why she would feel insulted. I mean, we both cleaned our house twice a week after work. We fucking busted our ass to make the house seem as immaculate as possible, but what my mother said, was pretty much a slap in our face. 


I finished the movie and walked into the bedroom. Carolyn was already asleep. I lied next to her and tried to fall asleep, but right as I started to drift off to sleep I saw a figure standing in front of our room. 


It was my mother. 


I tried to get out of bed and guide her back to her room, but before I get out of bed my eyelids became heavy and they slowly closed while my mind fell into a deep slumber. 


I woke up yesterday morning and saw that our room was a complete wreck. Every single drawer of our dresser was lying on the ground. Everything that was inside of the dresser was now covering pretty much every inch of our room. I got out of bed and heard Carolyns voice coming from the living room. With a sigh, I walked out of our room and saw that my wife and mother were having a very heated argument. 


Despite feeling slightly disappointed that there were already problems between my girlfriend and mother, I got in between them and did my best to settle them down. Once they managed to stop yelling at each other, I turned to my mother and asked her, Why did you go through all of our stuff? Were you trying to look for anything? 


After letting out an exasperated huff, my mother said, I was just looking for your test scores. I know you studied so hard for the test. Why wont you show them to me? 


Carolyn let out a snort and walked out the room. 


I put my hand on my mothers shoulder and sat her down on the couch. Feeling concerned, I asked her, What are you talking about? Its been almost 8 years since I took my last test. Are you feeling okay? 


Tears started to fall down my mothers face as she started to sob. 


I patted her shoulder and told her that I would find her some help, but she smacked my hand and started to scream, You need to go take the test that you have studied so hard for. I cant let you throw your life away like that. Go take the test and tell me how you did.


I started to tell her that I didnt have any upcoming tests and that we were fine but I couldnt let a word out. Hell, I couldnt even fucking breathe. I reached out to her, but everything blacked out on me. 


I woke up to the sound of my wife screaming. I couldnt really make out what she was saying but my mother sat next to me. When I tried getting up she pushed me back on the couch and told me to remain calm and relax until the paramedics arrived. 


When the paramedics got to my house they loaded me up on the gurney and pretty much threw me into the back of the ambulance. I tried asking them what was happening, but all I could really get out was a series of unintelligible mumbles and gurgles. Everything went black again and I didnt wake up until around 6 am this morning.


In the past 3 hours, I have learned that I have a tumor in my brain. My chances are pretty good. I asked the nurse where Carolyn and my mother were. She gave me a small smile and a nod before coming back in with Carolyn.


Carolyn rushed to my side and started to sob on my shoulder. She kept telling me that I was fine and that she was happy they caught it in time. When I asked her where my mother was she let out another sob and said, Baby, please. Please enough of that. You know your mother died 3 years ago. I dont know why you keep doing this to me. I tried to support you and to understand the stress you must be feeling. I even tried playing along with you, but this is too much baby. Please. Please just stop.


I know my mother died 3 years ago, but that doesnt mean shes gone. I mean. She was there for me when my previous manager died 2 years ago. He was shot in the head. Did I kill him? Of course, I didnt. I dont even own a gun. My mother just wanted to make sure I got the best position possible at my job. She was there when Carolyns ex-fianc was found in the middle of his living room. His face was completely torn off and his limbs were sliced off and thrown all around his room. Did I do it? How could I? I didnt even know where he lived. 


What Im saying is. My mother loved me and she always made sure I was always given the best opportunity. 


For now, I will act like I made a mental breakthrough. I will play the part of the man that was under so much stress that he imagined his mother still being alive. I will spill tears and let out sobs as I tell the doctors, nurses, and Carolyn that I have finally made peace, but most of all.


I will wait for my [mothers return.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TEXT> **Jeff Mendoza:**

**May 2nd, 2017:**

*Class 3*

*2nd Year Student*

***LOG 1***

Today was the first day of my 2nd year of studying at Prodigal Child Higher Education. I don't know if you have heard of my school, but my parents were all for it when my guidance counselor suggested it to them after I was expelled out of my high school for bringing a gun to school. Now, I'm not some crazy school shooter. I just brought it to scare my bully, Jeremy, so that he could stop bothering me. What I didn't know was that I didn't zip up my bag all of the way so on the way to my locker the gun dropped out of my bag. I didnt have any time or wanted to risk picking it up. I left it on the ground and rushed into my first-period class. 

It didn't take long for a couple of cops to come into the class with my principal and escort me out. 

As soon as I got into the principals office the cops started to badger me with questions. *What were you doing with the gun? Are you mad? Is there someone that you needed to shoot?*

I shook my head after their questions and calmly said, If you check the gun you will see that there were no bullets in it. It was just to scare a guy that kept bugging me. He said he wanted to fight me after school. I was just gonna show him the gun before the fight so that he would back out of the fight. 

My principal asked me to step out of the room and sit on the bench by his door. I walked out of the door and sat on the bench. I tried listening in on what they were saying, but they were speaking in whispers. Curiosity got the better of me and I slowly started to get up from the bench to lean in closer to the door when I heard my fathers voice come from down the hall. Jeff. What in the hell were you thinking? Why the fuck would you bring a gun to school? Are you fucking stupid boy? You wait till we get home. I swear you will wish you never knew what a gun was. My mom was walking next to him completely silent. She had the look of absolute anger and disappointment etched across her face. 

The whispering from the room stopped and I heard footsteps approach the door. One of the cops opened the door and nodded his head while saying, Morning Mister and Misses Mendoza, could you come in and have a word with us? The cop then looked at me and pointed into the room. I got up and followed my parents back into the office.

Long story short. We are a small town. They arent sending me to jail, but I am expelled from the school for the remainder of the year. I was expelled from the only high school within a 65-mile distance, but my amazing guidance counselor stopped us on the way out of school to give my parents a brochure and told them that it was a boarding school for troubled children like me. They gave her a look of concern until she said with a smile, Its free. 

Three days later I boarded a bus that was completely empty besides the driver and two other passengers my age. A girl and a boy. We didnt talk to each other for the entire 3-hour bus ride. The bus stopped in the middle of the field. When we got out I saw a plane in the distance. As we walked up to the plane I noticed that it was completely white. It was a huge plane or a small plane. When we walked in, I saw that there were about 36 seats on the plane. We were the only passengers on the plane as well.                                                

I was asleep for most of the plane ride. So I really dont know how long the plane ride was, but I woke up as we landed. I wanted to look out the window, but for some odd reason, I was nervous. I didnt really want to know where I was. I mean, when I asked my parents where I was going they would just ignore me and start talking about something else. 

As the plane started to come to a stop, I finally managed to muster up the courage to look out the window and saw that we were sitting in front of a giant purple brick building. An old weathered down sign hung loosely off of the front gate.

**Prodigal Child Higher Education**

The first couple of months inside of the school was pretty much like every other school, but I fucking loved it. Almost zero rules about what we could do after classes were over. Im not going to describe what went on for the first 11 months. Its basically whatever you would think happens when you group up 200 teenagers and let them do anything they want to do. Not the Lord of the Flies shit. More like the teenage version 50 Shades of Gray minus the shitty dialogue and the so-called dominatrix. 

Everything was perfect until the last month.

Shit has turned completely fucked up. I dont mean the regular teenage drama. Im talking about waking up and walking out of your dorm room and seeing the guy in the next dorm leaning against the wall next to my door. I tried to ask him if he was okay, but he fell over on the ground. His back was completely gashed open. There were twelve knives stuck into his back. I looked down and saw several other bodies lying on the ground. I closed the door and stayed on my bed.

I got back on the bed and lied there for as long as I could. I didnt want to get out. I was far too scared. Screaming came from the first floor every couple of minutes. I looked out the window about 45 minutes ago. There were bodies everywhere. Blood and body parts were strewn across the bottom floor. 

Im writing my first log now. Every website works here, but I feel like this is the best place to reach out. We dont have phones here, and if we do Im far too scared to leave my room. Please. Help me if you know any way to escape out [of this nightmare.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TITLE> My Grandfather's Journal Saved My Life </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-02 16:10:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For a 86 year old man my grandfather was extremely active and showed absolutely zero signs of slowing down. Even after breaking his hip bone just 2 years ago, he has recovered extremely quickly and walked around the neighborhood 3 times about a month after his surgery. 

My grandfather has always meant the world to me. He was always the man that tried to make me become the best person possible. If he caught me lying he wouldn't hit me. He would grab two 1 gallon jugs of water and made me hold it for an hour. On the other hand, if I ever did something praiseworthy he would use the little bit of money he had left to spoil me. My parents would also punish and reward me, but anything my grandfather did for me was far more memorable. Plus, my parents were always far too busy with their church. 

That is why when I started to struggle after college I reached out to my grandfather. By the next morning, he found me a room in the apartment he was living in. He paid 3 months up front for me and just asked me to go walking with him every morning at 7 am. I gratefully accepted his offer and promised to get a job so that I could pay him back as well as help him. With a laugh, he said, "First fix yourself. Then help others. You will succeed at whatever you do. Just figure out what you really want to dedicate your life to."

Three days after I moved into my one room apartment, I found a job at a place I truly loved working at. It may not sound like much, but ever since I was young I have always loved the thought of being a salesman. So when the manager at the local electronic's store offered me a job I took it without a second thought. That was two months ago, and I was doing great. I was 2nd place in sales the first month and then 1st the next month. The base pay was pretty low, but my monthly commission check was more than enough to pay back my grandfather and both of our rent and utility bills. 

Life was finally perfect for me. 

Every morning I would wake up at 6 am, take a shower, get dressed, eat a quick breakfast, and meet my grandfather on the first floor for our daily walk. Honestly, that was probably my favorite part of the day. We would walk to the local park and walk a couple of laps around the park. After about an hour of walking, we would go back to his apartment and drink a cup of coffee while I talked about my latest sales and he would bring out one of his 48 journals and read out a page. I know it sounds cliche, but every single day, he would read something that would end up helping me out that day. Usually, it would just help me with something minor like getting a huge sale or avoiding a bad purchase on my end, but two days ago it saved my life.

Two days ago, he told me about how he walked through a watermelon patch. He stopped in the middle of the field to tie his shoelaces, but while he was tying his shoe lace an angry farmer tackled him onto the ground. My grandfather started shouting at him and asking him what the hell he was doing, but the farmer kept accusing him of trying to steal his watermelon. It took him over 2 hours to finally convince the farmer he just stopped in the middle of the field to tie his shoelaces.

The moral was to never put yourself into sketchy ass situations. 

That day a couple of my coworkers helped the manager force an older woman buy a 4k OLED tv for 7k dollars. I was about to join in with the coworkers but the story my grandfather told me stopped me. I stood back and watched as the manager walked out from the back storage with a proud grin that matched equally with the oversized tv. Right after he completed the sale, I walked up to him and told him that I was feeling sick. Still excited from the sale, he just told me to go home and to come back the next day. 

I drove back home and saw my grandfather waiting for me in the parking lot. I got out and started to tell him about the sale the manager just made, but he just waved me off and said, "Don't tell me. I know. Go to your apartment and rest. Tomorrow is a new day." I gave him a small nod and walked up to the fourth floor and into my apartment. 

For the next three hours, I sat on my couch and watched tv. I was watching the news and waited for any type of new story about my store but before it was reported on the news I received a text from my manager.

*"Help. The old lady is back. Called 911 but you're closer. Her son is here. He has a gun"*

I know I should have gone there to help them, but I'm also not dumb. That's how motherfuckers die in movies. They try to be a hero and end up getting shot before anyone else does. Ends up looking like the biggest ass out of the rest of the characters. I know everything doesn't turn out like movies, but I don't have a gun or the heart to save the day. I ignored the message and kept staring at the screen.

One hour later, my store came up on the tv screen. The headline read, **"3 Found Dead From Store Shooting."**

Photos of my manager and the two salesmen that helped him make the sale came up on the screen. I shut the tv off and went to bed. While I was lying on my bed a million thoughts flew through my mind. Will I still have my job? Why does everything my grandfather warn me about end up coming true? What am I supposed to do now? Could I have saved their lives? 

After hours of interrogating myself, I fell into a restless sleep. 

Yesterday morning I woke up at 6 am. I went through my normal morning routine and walked downstairs to the first floor. My grandfather wasn't there. I knocked on his door. It was completely silent inside for a couple of seconds, but finally, I heard the sound of soft footsteps approaching the front door. When the door opened, I looked up at the man that pretty much took care of me as I grew into the man I am now. He was completely pale and looked far more sick than anyone I have ever seen in my life. Thick blue veins were visible from his near translucent face. With an obvious struggle, he said, "Come in. Take the journals. Use them. They will help you become the best person you could possibly become, but don't help others with them. That is when your life will start to leave you. That is the deal. Above all, don't pass them off to anyone else. That is when you completely give up on your life."

I saw something move behind him. Even in the dark room, I managed to see what looked like a completely naked man slowly walk behind him.  As he got right behind my grandfather I caught a good glimpse of him. He was completely pale, but words were written all over its body. Its face was completely normal except for the mouth. The mouth was unnaturally small with on single tooth coming out from the top of its mouth. Before I could warn my grandfather, it sunk its tooth into his neck and slowly started to suck. Within seconds, all that was left was my grandfather's skin. 

It has been about 24 hours since my grandfather gave up his life to give me the best life possible. Even after 24 hours, I cannot process what the fuck happened. I want to cry, but I refuse to accept the fact that my grandfather is dead. No. I haven't called the cops. What the fuck do you want me to tell them? That some journal spirit sucked the inside of my grandfather? Fuck that. Instead, I have been reading the journals nonstop. Trying to find some sort of way to bring my grandfather back, but I have yet to find the answer.

If any of you guys know what kind of spirit I am dealing with please let me know. Especially if you know if there is a way to bring a person back. I'm not ready to be on my own yet. I refuse to believe that my grandfather is gone forever. So please. Please. Help me. Please help me bring [my grandfather back.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Baby Wipes Are Recalled For a Reason </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-30 17:40:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So do you guys remember the whole I Found Glass Pieces in My Huggies Diaper phase? Basically, a lot of parents complained on all platforms of social media about how they could see glass pieces on the baby wipes they used on their babies. It ended up being a false alarm. Just chemicals they use in their baby wipes to clean the baby shit better. 

My name is Marshall and I was one of the guys that thought all of the parents freaking out were stupid as fuck. I mean. They really were. Who the fuck would accidentally put glass in millions of baby wipes? 

That is why when I found boxes of recalled baby wipes sitting in the middle of the local church I grabbed up two boxes before I walked the 2-mile distance home. 

You see, I live in a one bedroom apartment with 4 other people. John and Richard were my two friends from college. We all dropped out the first year of college. 

Zach was a guy I went to a bunch of parties with. He was around 35 years old but he never complained about how late we stayed up or how loud we were. Shit, I mean he was usually the one causing the most noises and stayed up the latest. 

Brian was a friend of Richard. I was a little skeptical of him at first, but after I realized how much of a great guy he really was I ended up becoming more close to him than anyone in the house. He was 22 years old and was always trying to find ways to better all of our lives. He would go out and walk around the city until he could come back home with a huge stack of job applications for all of us. 

The rent was 400 but we barely made enough to pay the rent as well as buy everything we needed for the month. 

We were close friends, but the last couple of days were the absolute worst. Fuck, I mean we couldnt even buy toilet paper, but that is what happens when all of made most of our money from odd jobs and begging on the street. We didnt all go out on the same day to beg for money. We took turns. The original deal was that while a group would beg for money the others would go around town and look for jobs. Brian was the only one that fulfilled both jobs.


That is why I lugged two boxes of foreign looking baby wipes two days ago. 

When I walked through the door I saw my four roommates sitting in the living room. I threw the boxes in the middle of the living room and started tossing them packs of baby wipes. Everyone blankly stared at the item in their hands except for Brian, he looked up at me and said, Dude. Thank you. I have gotten tired of having to take an ass shower every time I take a shit. I laughed and walked to my couch in the living room.

We all watched a couple of tv shows until around 1 in the morning. During that time we all used the baby wipes for our bathroom trips. 

Yesterday morning I woke up to probably the itchiest ass hole ever. I ran into the restroom and um. Well. I looked at my ass hole and saw that there were tiny bumps surrounding the hole. I tried pressing on a couple of the bumps but it just made it even itchier. 

Im not stupid, I knew the bumps came from the baby wipes. So for the next day, I didnt use the baby wipes. I warned the others, but none of the others had any kind of discomfort from the baby wipes. Well not until around 3 pm.

Zach ran out of the room with what seemed like a bloated sausage in his hand. It took me a minute to realize that it was his dick. Fuck. Before he could even tell us how much it hurt I knew. There were two huge bumps on each side of his deformed limb. He started screaming at me, What the fuck dude. What the fuck is going on? You. Dude. Youre fucking twisted. Youre fucking evil. You piece of sh- In the middle of his screaming one of the bumps exploded. 

Thin tissues hung loosely around the gap of what seemed like where the semen and urine traveled through to exit out of the body. Blood started to pour out of exposed flesh. He tried to grab it and stop the bleeding but the blood continued to come out of the gaps of his hands and spill down his fingers. I heard a soft pop come from inside of his hands and Zach let out a silent scream before passing out. I called the ambulance and paramedics rushed into our apartment about ten minutes after I made the call. When they placed him on the gurney his arms hung limply off the side of it and the tip of his dick barely hung off of his body by two small strands of tissue barely hanging on. 

Brian was with me when they took Zach away on the ambulance. He asked me, Yo. What the hell is going on? What the fuck happened to Zach?

After a couple of seconds, I responded back in almost a whisper, Please. Please. Man. Just. Shit. Please tell me that you didnt use the baby wipes.

Brian put his hand on my shoulder and said, Yeah man. I used it once last night, but this morning I found a couple of small bumps on my butt. I figured I should stop using them after that.

I let out a small sigh of relief and said, Yeah. There is something really wrong with these baby wipes. I found small bumps around my fucking ass hole. It sounds dumb, but shit dude, I knew that I shouldnt use it. I tried to tell the others to stop using them but they didnt listen.

Brian went into the room after our talk and I didnt see him for the rest of the day. 

Around 9 pm, John and Richard came home from their day out on the streets. Richard sat on the couch and started watching tv. John looked at me for a second before asking, Where is Zach? I told them about how Zach was now in the hospital. I told them about how his dick was fucked up from the baby wipes. I begged them to not use them. They looked at me while I told them everything. After I was done speaking it was quiet for minutes. Richard finally spoke up. With a voice slightly above a whisper, he said, So yeah. We will stop using those baby wipes. Fuck it. I made enough money today to get us a pack of toilet paper. What is Brian doing now? I shook my head and gave them a shrug before I got comfortable on my couch and fell asleep. 

I woke up this morning with the worst pain coming from my bum. I ran into the restroom and saw that there was now only one large bump poking out of my ass hole. With a deep breath, I poked at the bump. The bump was light pink with white dots floating around. I poked at it several times until the bump popped.

I knew that there would be a lot of muscle missing from that section, but I wasnt prepared for what I was about to see. Tiny clear worm-like creatures were latched onto my flesh. They were burrowing themselves inside of my flesh. I tried to grab them out but all I managed to do was tear more of my flesh out.

With strips of ass muscle hanging from my hands, I passed out. 

When I woke up it was around 8 in the morning. I was feeling really lightheaded but I managed to get to my couch and call 911. I dont know what happened to my roommates but when the paramedics walked through my front door I passed out again. 

I woke back up at the hospital. Im afraid to look at what happened to me, but I still feel something within me. Little fucking shits swimming inside of me. Fuck. Im writing to you guys. When baby wipes get recalled. Dont trust that shit. Theyre recalled for a reason. 

Like I said. There are thousands of unknown parasites eating my flesh and dwelling inside of my body. I dont know what happened to the others. 

Please let me know if you used baby wipes called Cleaner Than a Newborn. If you somehow survived this shit please let me know. I need all of the [help I can get.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/notifications/)

<TITLE> The Serial Killer is Probably a Virgin </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-22 15:52:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So being a twenty-nine-year-old virgin is hard enough, but the fact that Im probably living with a serial killer has made things far more difficult for me. My name is Richard and I work as a security guard at a really creepy looking mental hospital. (No this is not where the scary shit takes place. Stop with the eye rolling or the super humid deep breaths youre taking to fog up your poor phone screens.) I live in a 4 bedroom house with my three high school buddies, James, Will, and Timothy. Yes, we are a household full of basic ass names. Dont judge us.

What makes us unique is that we are all pretty much the same type of person. Rejects since high school, socially awkward, and never went on a single date. I guess Will is kind of our hero. He had sex with a prostitute when he first graduated high school. I mean, we all kind of looked up to him until we found out that the woman came with an extra body part he never really expected. I still had a sliver of respect for him. He went through with it and was still pretty proud of the whole experience. Whenever any of us tried to make fun of him he would always respond back with, A butthole is a butthole. Dont matter.

Even though we had our faults and I never had a decent wingman for when we decided to go out to the club or the bar, I was completely happy. My parents kicked me out of my house when I decided to not go to college or the military. Three days after my graduation I saw my stuff sitting on the outside of my house. I tried knocking on the door and calling them but they ignored me. I grabbed my stuff and Will was the first one to offer me a place to stay in. 

Like I said, I was perfectly happy with everything. 

Yesterday, it all changed for me. I came back home after work and sat on the couch. I turned on the tv and started watching a show about pawn shop workers with really shitty attitudes. In the middle of the show, James walked in and sat down next to me. He tapped on my shoulder and when I looked over he said, So. Yeah. Check this shit out. He pulled out his phone and showed me a news article. It was about a guy we went to high school with. His name was Jerry and he was found in his apartment with half of his face melted off. His right hand was chopped off and shoved into his half burnt mouth. His genitals were mutilated, and he was still alive for three hours after he arrived at the hospital. The worst part of it all was that we saw him maybe three days before. He was bragging about how he finally managed to get a girl back to his place. He bragged about using his hands to please her as well as his mouth and well, his penis. 

After I finished reading the article I looked over at James and asked him if they had any clue on who did it. He just shrugged his shoulders and said, Shit if I know man. Some sick fuck. I didnt say anything back after that. He got up and walked into his room after sitting with me for a couple more minutes. 

Timothy came home around 8 in the evening. He didnt really have anything to say. He just gave me a nod and walked down the hall to his bedroom. Will came home around 11 pm with a woman. He introduced me to her. Her name was Grace. She was a coworker of his at Walmart. She was going to hang out with him for the night. I wanted to talk to the other two about the death of Jerry, but it just didnt seem like the right time. That night I struggled to fall asleep. The thoughts of Jerry along with the sounds of lovemaking coming from the room next to mine made sleep impossible. As the sun started to rise, the sound stopped, and I was finally able to fall asleep. 

When I woke up this morning I saw Timothy running as fast as he could to the front door. As I started to get off of my bed I saw cops walking past my doors. 

I walked out of my room and saw that they were walking into Wills room. Curious and concerned, I followed them into his room. Will was lying in his bed, but his face was deathly pale. As soon as the officers pulled the cover off of Will I saw that he was beyond saving. His body was on the opposite side of the bed. It was sewed to the face of Grace. His head was sewed to the body of Graces and cut into the stomach of the body Wills head was attached to said, College or Military.

The cops talked to all of us. After a couple of hours of all of us answering question after question, they left the same way they walked in. Confused and clueless as to what created this gory double homicide. 

Of course, I really hope it isnt any of my roommates, but I have my eyes on my two remaining roommates as well as the people that we have grown close to outside of our circle. 

I know most of you guys are going to tell me to move out or get a gun, but I really dont have any place I can go to. I dont have any sort of rental history so I cant get a place without an outrageous deposit that I do not have. I cant use a gun when I dont know who to use it on. Please let me know if you have any idea. I know no one is really an expert on this matter, but I feel like this is my best shot at getting any kind of answer. 

A lot of you guys may think that its my parents, but its not possible.

[Part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/66ally/i_will_either_face_a_gruesome_death_or_make_half/)

Elijah woke me up this morning. When I opened my eyes he said, Your chances of survival increased. He pointed over to the right and I looked over and saw Allison lying on the bed. She was sprawled out on her bed, but she was completely pale. A needle and an empty bag were in her clutched right hand. Elise was already sitting up on her bed staring at Allisons lifeless body. She looked up and stared at me before shrugging her shoulders and walking towards the kitchen. Her arm was in a makeshift sling Elijah made for her, but other than her arm she seemed to be her normal self.

Elijah gave me a light tap on my shoulder and said, Come on. Time for breakfast. Eat up. We are starting the next challenge right as soon as you guys finish. I gave him a nod and walked into the kitchen. There were only two chairs at the table. I took a seat and slowly ate my eggs and bacon. 

In the middle of the meal, Elise cleared her throat. I looked up and she said, Well might as well learn more about each other before the contest ends.

I wasnt really interested in learning about her, but I nodded my head and said, Sure. Why not. I mean. It wont really change anything, but at least our memory somewhat moves on if we lose.

I dont know how much this conversation really means to everybody, but for me, it changed everything.

Elise: Im an artist. Well. I like to think I am but no one really appreciates my art. Not even my father. He threw me out of the house when I refused to go to college. So I lived out on the streets for the past year. I tried selling my paintings out on the streets but no one really appreciates art created by a bum. Its always been like that. Singers that could have topped the billboard charts die every day. The next Edgar Allen Poe dies on the streets with powder on their nose and dreams still captured in their still heart, but what do they get? Just judgment their whole lives and a sense of absolute loneliness.

Me: Yeah. Shit. I really wish I had something to live for like you. My family is fucked up. My mother and father kicked me out of my house when I refused to kill my grandfather. They wanted his money, but unfortunately for them, I loved my grandfather far more than empty promises. I dont really have a dream. I dont have anything that I am amazing at, but I want to get my revenge. I want to end their pathetic lives.

Elise: Wanna make a deal?

Me: What kind of deal?

Elise: If I win, I will make sure I end your parents lives. If you win, go to my house. The house I received when I killed my father. He was the guy I stabbed in the video. Just so that something I created can stand proudly on display in the house I forever sought acceptance in. Deal?

Me: Yeah. Deal. Um. Well. Good luck.

Elise: You too. Can I ask you an odd question?

Me: Sure.

Elise: Was I prettier than Allison?

Me: Um.

Elise: Never mind. My dad always told me that Allison was the prettier and smarter one. Turns out he was wrong about her. She definitely wasnt smarter. I was just hoping he chose the wrong daughter to favor.

Me: Wait. What?

She was silent after that for the rest of the meal.

Right after we finished our meal Elijah walked up to us and said, Follow me. He walked out the front door and we followed him. While we were walking, I couldnt help myself. I lightly rubbed Elises arm and she looked back with a small smile before grabbing my hand and held onto it as we walked towards the back of the house. 

Once we got to the back Elijah took out his phone and started up the camera. With a huge grin, he started speaking, Now our last challenge. Allison had an. Hm. An accident. We have our two final contestants left. Let me tell you. This has gotten quite emotional. Thirty minutes ago I overheard them telling each other their little sob stories. He sarcastically wiped a fake tear from his eye and continued. So. The last challenge. He whistled and snapped his fingers. His two helpers came out carrying a large bag and dropped it in front of Elijah. He winked at his helpers before continuing. Okay. So Allisons dead body is in this bag. The challenge is to eat as much of her body as you can. The one that loses will be held down by my two wonderful assistants. It is up to the winner how they will die. If the winner cannot take the life of the other person they will also admit defeat.

I heard a gasp from Elise as Elijah opened up the bag and revealed Allisons dead body. Elijah moved the bag out of the way and pointed the camera towards her body and said, Alright guys. Dig in!

I didnt hesitate for a single second. 

I knelt beside the corpse and started to bite down on her thighs. With each bite, I felt her meat tearing at the force of my teeth. The meat ripped off and landed on my tongue and I started to chew as fast as I could and before I knew it, a decent sized chunk was taken out of her thigh. Elise was screaming at me to quit ruining the corpse of her sister, but I ignored her and continued to stuff my mouth with as much meat as I could tear off of Allison. 

I started to feel sick to my stomach so I sat back. Elise was taking little bites off of Allison in between sobs, but I was unaffected. 
After my stomach settled I started to bite into her other thigh. It only took me two more bites before I saw Elise start running away as fast as she could. 

Elijahs helpers caught up to her before she managed to even get around the first corner. They dragged her in front of me and I stood up. Elise looked up at me with pleading eyes, but with a smile, I kicked her in the side of the head. I was this close to the money I wasnt going to quit now. She started to plead for her life but I ignored her as I knelt down next to her head and started to punch her head as hard as I could. 

A gun landed next to my leg and I picked the gun up. Elise looked up as the punches stopped. When she saw the gun she said, Just make it quick. Remember our deal. Please. Just make it qui

I shot her left foot. She started to scream and sob but I ignored it. I shot her in the other foot and she tried to break free out of their grip but she couldnt. I gave a little laugh as I shot her three more times on her back. 

She looked at me after sobbing and asked, Why?

Before I took my last shot I said, You made one big mistake. Allison. She was my sister. She was the one that my family favored over me. You thought you could make a lie that big and get away with it? Dont worry. I wont forget our deal, but know that you told the wrong lie.

I closed my eyes after I placed the end of the barrel on the back of her head. 

Before I pulled the trigger, I heard her beg me to forgive her. To let her live, but I have come too far to give it all up. With a scream, I pulled the trigger and I heard Elijah say, Its over. Jared. Its done. I dropped the gun and stood up. He gave me a small smile before the world went black.

I woke up on the same spot I woke up before the competition. I sat up and felt around my pockets. I found a card in my pocket. There was nothing on it except a black strip on the top of one side of the card. On the other side #6930 was written on the bottom right corner of it.

I checked it at the ATM. 6930 was the password for the account. I checked the balance and saw that I was 500 grand richer. 

I went to the local Walmart and bought the cheapest laptop they had. After that, I went to the cheapest hotel and rented out a room for 2 months. 

I keep thinking about Elise. How she struggled on the ground as I kicked and punched her as hard as I could, how she begged me before I shot her in the back of the head, but most of all, how she looked when she found out Allison was my sister.

Then I think about how she would have looked at me if she saw me standing by Allisons bed heating up the rest of the tar on the spoon then filling up the needle and releasing the drug inside of the vein prominently sticking out of her arm three times. 

Like I said. I needed to win. I have a mission to accomplish.

My sister was always favored by my parents, but it seems like they picked the wrong child [to favor.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

People do what they want. At least the authors are giving up hours of their time a day to entertain others. 

While the complainers try to bring down writers.

<TEXT> [DAY 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/66373g/i_will_either_face_a_gruesome_death_or_make_half/)

When I woke up this morning the image of Codys open eye sockets flashed in my mind. I looked around the room and everyone was already awake. Blake and Elise looked completely normal but Allison was shaking and looked completely pale. I asked her if she was okay. She looked at me with eyes filled with torment before throwing up all over her bed. Blake jumped out of his bed and ran to Allison and started to pat her on the back. She shook him off and said, Im fine. Just, please. Dont touch me. Im sure you would rather touch pretty boy over there anyways. 

Blake stood up from his bed. He opened his mouth but immediately closed it again when Elijah walked into our room. After a small cough, Elijah looked down at us and said, Its time for breakfast. Get dressed. Allison you um. You take a shower. It smells disgusting in here. Allison put her hand out towards Elijah and asked, Do you have any. ugh. Any heroin? I need it. I cant go on without it. Please. Can you help me? Elijah scoffed and told her to wait in the room. Elise went into the restroom to change her clothes while Blake and I changed in the room. Allison had her face on the pillow the entire time. 

Right as I finished dressing, Elijah walked back into the room and threw a small spoon with brown tar on it, a lighter, and a needle on Allisons bed before walking back out. I didnt want to watch her do that again so I followed Elijah out of the room. We walked into the kitchen and saw two pieces of toast on each plate and a jar of grape jelly sitting in the middle of the table. I took a seat and quietly ate. Blake and Elise came out a couple minutes after I did and started eating. 

When I finished my breakfast I got up and walked into the living room. Elijah was sitting on the couch staring out the window. I sat next to him and asked, So when are we starting today? Elijah let out a quiet sigh and said, We start in 6 hours. Relax until then. Meditate if you do that shit. You do any drugs? I thought for a second and asked, Shit. I want some cigarettes and the harshest drink youve got. Elijah looked at me for a second before laughing and slapped me on my back. He got up from his chair and walked out the front door. A couple minutes later, he came back with a thermos and a carton of Marlboro Smooths. I gratefully took them from his hands and sat back on the couch.

I ripped open the carton and took out a pack of cigs. I dont know about you, but no matter how stressful anything is. A cigarette somehow takes the edge off. It makes you think that no matter what situation you are in. You have a chance of getting through whatever you find yourself in. Right as I put the cigarette in my mouth Elijah lit it for me. I sat back on the couch and opened the thermos. Took a sip and felt the liquid go down my throat and produce a feeling of warmth and comfort instantaneously. 

I closed my eyes for what felt like a second, but Elijah was shaking me and telling me to wake up. I groggily opened my eyes and grunted in response. The thermos bottle was still in my hand. Holding back throw up, I put the thermos bottle down and saw that half of it was gone. After a couple of deep breaths, I got up from the couch and walked into the room. The other three were sitting on their bed staring at a simple white table that was just placed in the middle of the room. Elijah walked up into the room and up to the table and said, Well guys. Its time. Im going to use my phone to record you guys tonight. He tapped on his phone a couple of times before pointing the camera towards us. 

He let out a whistle and one of the men dressed in all black walked into the room and set four knives on top of the table. Elijah pointed the camera towards the knives and said, Alright guys walk up to the table and grab a knife. Once you pick a knife walk back to your bed with it and sit down. I got up from the bed and grabbed a knife along with the others and walked back to my bed. Elijah turned his phone around and I could see his face fill the screen along with **42683 viewers** written on the top right of the screen. He let out a dramatic breath before saying, Okay guys. The game has begun. Do what your gut tells you to do! Show the world who you truly are. 

He stood in the corner and pointed the camera back at us. 


We all stared at each other dumbly for what felt like an eternity. Elise was gripping her knife extra hard as she stared each of us down. Allison was sitting in the middle of her bed. Clutching the knife with both of her hands. Blake had his head hung down low. He was barely holding on to his knife. I started to look back at Allison, but Blake let out a huge sob. I looked back at him and saw him staring at Elijah. Tears were dripping down his face. He grabbed his knife and with a shout lunged towards Elise. Her eyes were wide and her body was still as Blake plunged a knife deep into her left shoulder. A scream erupted from her mouth as she tried to push Blake off of her. He took the knife out of her shoulder and started to bring it back down on her when Elijah grabbed him and threw him on the ground. Elijahs helper ran up to Blake and kicked the knife out of his hand. Blake tried to get back up, but the man pushed him back on the ground and tied up his wrists tightly with rope. 

Elijah nodded at the man and walked up to Blake and held him down. The man then walked up to each of us and took the knives from us. 

Once he gathered all of the knives he grabbed Blake by his hair and sat him on his bed. Elijah grinned at Blake while he pointed the camera towards him and said, Well that was awfully quick. Blake. Blake. Blake. Were you mad? What made you stab poor little Elise? What did she do to you? Huh? Made fun of you for liking mens butt? Blake looked up at him and stared him down. Elijah let out a small laugh before saying, Well honestly. I dont really give a fuck. You proved that lust wasnt your only fault, and because of your little hissy fit. You lost. He turned the camera back towards him and said, Okay. I have chosen two people to give my lovely assistants instructions on how we should end Blakes life.

He whistled towards the door and his other helper walked in and helped the other man carry Blake and placed him on the table. 

Elijah then looked at us and said, Open up your laptops so you can see that commands that come on the screen. I opened up my laptop and instantly saw Blakes face fill the screen. 

The first command came on the screen. 

**I want you to chop off his hands.**

One of the men grabbed a knife out of the bag while the other held Blakes hands down on the table. The man quickly brought down the knife down and the sound of bones crunching against sharpened metal followed by a loud thud as the knife landed on the table filled the room. Blake didnt scream. He just looked at the bloody stub that was once his right hand. Before Blake even took his eyes off his severed hand the man sliced off his other hand. 

I tried turning my head away to avoid watching anymore but I couldnt move. I wanted to help him, but I knew it would only end up with me giving up my life. I looked back on the screen as the next command came up.

**Stab him in the stomach and shove one of his severed hands inside.**

I managed to look away right after the man stabbed him in the midsection. He was whimpering but it soon became screams of pure agony. It took all of my willpower to look away. I thought it was over when the room became quiet, but I felt someone tapping on my shoulder. I looked up and saw Elijah standing next to me. He pointed at the screen and I looked at the next command.

**Get Jared. I want him to slice a chunk of Blakes thigh off and take a bite off of it. He must chew it and swallow.**

I had to reread it several times before I could even comprehend what I was supposed to do. Elijah grabbed my arm and led me up to the table. Blake was lying down on the table almost completely still. He was slowly blinking as I took the knife from the man. 

This is where I doubted everything about me. I thought I would never be the person that would be able to mutilate a person, eat a chunk of human meat, or do it without hesitation, but within seconds I was shoving Blakes severed thigh flesh in between my lips. I took a decent sized bite out of it and soon my mouth filled with the taste of salt and copper. I gagged a little, but I kept chewing until I managed to get it into a texture I could swallow. 

Elijah gave me a small tap on the middle of my back before saying, Okay guys. Last request and we are done for the night.

It only took a couple of seconds for the last command to pop up. 

**Let Jared see my face. Let him see my face as I watch him stab Blake 5 times in the chest.**

Elijah let out a sigh and clicked on the profile that sent out the last command. It showed a picture of when I was 7. I wanted to scream but I held it in. Elijah then turned on the feed to the persons camera and saw myself looking at my mother and father. They were smiling at me and my mother cleared her throat before saying, Well what are you waiting for. This is your chance. Your only chance to finally bring us happiness. You were always such a pussy, but Im glad you finally decided to do something ballsy. Pick up that knife and make mommy and daddy proud. 

Without hesitation, I stabbed Blake in the chest. I didnt stop at 5. I kept going. I couldnt stop. I was sobbing and I didnt want to kill him off, but he wasnt the one that was in my mind while I stabbed him. I thought about how amazing it would be to stab my parents. Over and over again. 

I snapped out of my moment of lunacy and looked down at the table. Blakes chest was nearly gashed completely open. I dropped the knife back on the table and walked back to my bed.

Its been 3 hours since I ended Blakes life and made a new mission for myself. 

I needed to win. I needed to stab my parents as many times as I stabbed Blake. They deserved the death I gave him. I dont care about the money anymore. I needed to get revenge on my parents. The pieces of shit that kicked me out of the house when I refused to kill my grandpa so that they could get what he left for them. The ones that refused to give me a single cent when I called them and told them I was starving.

The ones that told me that the only way for me to go back home was if I killed my [grandfather.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wouldn't really spice things up, but I think on the weekly posts if you added in the nosleep rules as well it would benefit the community. A lot of new readers on mobile will not know what they are commenting is against the rules so if it was at the top of the page it would reduce a lot of the "rule-breaking" comments!

just a suggestion :c </TEXT>

For the publisher. NoSleep has a great publishing company that sort of works with them. Once you get a decent following and a good story line they will contact you! Or you can contact them. Just PM me and I will let you know specifics!

<TITLE> I Will Either Face a Gruesome Death or Make Half a Million </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-18 16:35:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello, my name is Jared and I am homeless. Well. I was homeless. Im now fighting for my life. How did I find myself in that predicament? Well, I chose to. Why? Because I want to win half a million dollars.

Last Night, I was walking around the streets of downtown Nashville. I finished the day off with around thirteen dollars in my pocket. Im not homeless because I had shit luck. Im homeless because I was a stubborn twenty-year-old trying to make it out on my own. I had family waiting for me back home, but I wasnt ready to crawl back to my family yet. Like I said, Im a stubborn guy. I would rather die than beg my parents to take me back. 

With the thirteen dollars I had in my pocket I could buy two gatorades, three ham and cheese sandwiches, and a pack of smokes. I was on the way to my usual convenience store when a man got out of the back seat of a Bentley and walked up to me. He was casually dressed in a t-shirt and jeans but I knew that the clothes he wore cost a small fortune. As he stuck out his hand towards me he said, Hey bud my name is Elijah and I would like to buy you some dinner. You look hungry. I shook his hand and asked him, Why? I have a little bit of money. I can buy my own dinner. 

He chuckled and said, Well. It looks like you havent had a decent meal in ages. Tell you what. I have way too much money and I like helping out people less fortunate. Ill get you some dinner and we can talk. If you dont like what I say I will personally go to any hotel of your choice and get you a room for 3 months. That sound fair?

I thought about it for a second before nodding my head nervously at him. He put his arm around my shoulder and led me into his car. He didnt take me anywhere really fancy. Just the local steakhouse and we took our seat at the back of the restaurant. He ordered a salad and I ordered a t-bone steak. The first half of the meal was silent. He wasnt really eating, just kept staring into the salad and moving around pieces of lettuce with his fork. 

The silence was broken when he put down his fork and let out a small cough. I looked back up at him with a large chunk of steak in my mouth and he softly asked, I have an opportunity for you. I swallowed what was in my mouth and asked, What kind of opportunity? Like a job? He gave me a small smile and said, Yeah. Well. Kind of. Let me be completely honest with you. I see you as a strong willed person. Suicide is the last thing on your mind, and that is what I am looking for. I have been watching you for the last three days. Keep in mind. This is an opportunity for you to make half a million dollars. That should be enough for you to be happy for a very long time.

Half curious and half disturbed, I put down my fork and asked, What do you mean you watched me for three days? What do I have to do to make the money? How do I know you even have that much money?  

After taking a deep breath, he got up from his chair and sat next to me. He leaned his face towards my ear and whispered, Five people go in. One person leaves. This is for a, hm, lets just say its a show. People from all over the world pay fifty grand to watch you guys like its a reality tv show. Of course, people will die and it might be you, but if you win. You get to take home five hundred grand. No strings attached. 

I scooted away from him and pushed the meal away from me. He started to speak again but I held my hand up and told him to let me think. 

I know. Money isnt everything, but this was an opportunity for me. Probably a once in a lifetime opportunity. I knew the probabilities pointed to an early grave for me, but I just couldnt lose this chance. 

A chance to finally prove to my family that I was fully self-capable.

I looked back at him and said, Im in. When do we start? 

He clapped his hands together and said, Well we need to head out now. I will drive you to our private airplane. Erm. Im going to have to blindfold you when we get in the car, but the contest starts the day after tomorrow.

When he got up from his chair I got up and followed him to his car. He grabbed a blindfold from the front passenger seat and handed it to me. I covered my eyes up and sat back. After a couple of minutes, I felt the car start up and he put something in my hand and said, Take this pill. Itll knock you right out. I shrugged my shoulders and threw the pill into my mouth and swallowed it. As the car started to speed up I slowly drifted off. 

I woke up and felt a small pain inside of my ear. Once I managed to stand up I rubbed my eyes and looked around. Within a couple of seconds, I knew I was on a plane. There were two other guys and two women sleeping on their chairs. I sat back down on my seat and stared out the window. I noticed that it was the morning now. We were descending, but all I could see was the ocean. After a couple of minutes, the plane started to descend quickly. I looked out the window and saw an endless amount of trees. As the plane started to quickly go down I sat back in my seat and braced myself. I was completely convinced that we were about to crash into the trees, but as the plane touched down on the ground I saw that we were in a small clearing. 

The plane came to a stop and a door opened from the back of the plane. Elijah came out and walked to the front of the plane. I looked around and saw that everyone else was awake. He looked at all of us for a second before saying, Alright. Let me see if I can remember. Jared, Blake, Cody, Allison, and Elise. Did I get that right? We all nodded and he smiled before continuing, Okay follow me out of the plane and I will lead you guys to your room. The contest starts tomorrow. We have a computer for each of you to use. You can call out for help if youd like too, but it wont help. You see. We are now on an island that is not traceable. Plus, if you get found you wont win the money! So. The nights are your time. The daytime is entertainment time. Your only objective is to not be the last one to finish the challenge. The last one to complete the challenge will provide our lovely viewers with whatever they request.

He snapped his fingers at us and we all got up and followed him out of the plane and saw a small house in front of us. I started to panic, but I reminded myself that this is what I wanted. 

A chance to either prove myself or die. 

I was the first one to walk into the house and looked around. It was a small house with worn down hardwood floors, blue wall paint that was chipping with age, and a kitchen with surprisingly new appliances. The only thing in the living room was a small brown couch. I walked past the kitchen and into the only bedroom in the house. It was a larger room than I expected. There were five small beds with a laptop on each bed. The others walked up to the room and quietly picked out their bed. I chose the one closest to the door. 

Elijah walked into the room and said, I lied. The contest starts today. Open your laptop and turn it on. There will be a window that pops up. If you turn off your laptop or turn off the screen you instantly lose. He closed the door and I grabbed my laptop and booted it on. When the home screen came up a window came up almost immediately. 

The window was completely white for a second before it showed a footage of Blake walking into a store and groping a mans ass before running out of the store. We all looked at him and chuckled while he started to grow pale. The next clip showed Allison sitting in an alley shoving a needle into her arm and slowly injecting herself. I looked at her, but she looked away from all of us. Next, it showed Elise breaking into a house. She walked up to the sleeping man on the couch and she grabbed her pocketknife and sunk it into his throat. She proceeded to stab him 4 more times before running around his house and grabbing whatever valuable thing she saw. When her clip ended none of us looked at her. We didnt want to see a person witnessing a murder they committed. 

Right as they showed me on the screen I knew what it was. It was from two days ago. I was in the convenience store I always went into. A woman walked into the store and I dont know what came over me, but she was beautiful. She was wearing a very short skirt and a white shirt that prominently revealed her nipples when under the right light. I reached into my pants and pleasured myself. Right as I climaxed I looked up and saw that she was staring at me in disgust. I gave her a small nod before running out the store. I heard a couple of chuckles coming from the others, but the only thought that was running through my head was how they managed to get that filmed. 

Right as the next clip came up I heard Cody yell out, Fuck that. What the fuck. You show pussy ass shit for everyone else. Why the fuck you show me doing this shit? I looked back at the screen and saw Cody speaking to an old woman. They were laughing together while sitting on a park bench. She handed him a picture and I saw Codys face instantly turn sour. He started to yell at her and grab her by the shoulder. She tried pushing off of him, but he then put his hands around his throat and started to squeeze. She tried to get out of his grip, but she became still and he let go of her throat and ran away. The screen zoomed in on the picture. It was of Cody, the woman, and a man. I love you son, but please know that your daddy loved you just as much. 

Cody slammed his laptop shut and started to scream at us, Dont fucking judge me. I loved my mom, but she always backed up that filthy bitch. He fucking did shit to me man. He didnt love me. He was a piece of shit.

Elijah came into the room with two other men dressed in all black. The two men dressed in black picked up Cody and took him outside. Elijah stayed in the room and said, Keep the laptops on and stay on the screen you were looking at. Watch Codys punishment so that you may know what happens when you lose.

The screen came back live and I saw the two men standing behind Cody. He was sobbing and pleading for his life. It was the first time I saw a truly broken man. It took all of my willpower to not shut my laptop off right then.

Messages started to pop up on the bottom of the screen. 

The first one said, Take his eyes out. I dont want him to see what we will do to him next.

I saw Codys eyes glance down at the screen and he started to scream. The man on the right nodded his head and grabbed a rusty spoon from the table behind him. The other man held on to Codys face to keep it steady while the other guy scooped his eyes out. 

The next message said, I want you to cut off three of his fingers and shove it down his throat. The man put down the spoon and grabbed a kitchen knife. While the other man held on to Codys hand I looked away from the screen. The sound of bones crunching vibrated my eardrums. I looked back at the screen and saw Codys scream halting and changing to gagging as three of his fingers were shoved down his throat. 

The man that held the knife said, One last request. Make this one fatal.

The last message said, Stab him in the head 14 times. Keep stabbing even if he dies. 

The man nodded his head and put the kitchen knife down and picked up a pocket knife. 

Cody started to whisper, Please. Please. Just let me go back. I wont tell anyone about this. I just want to go back. I just His pleading ended when the knife entered and exited his head with forceful stabs. 

After the man stabbed Cody for the fourteenth time the screen blacked out and closed out. 

Elijah looked at all of us for a couple of seconds before saying, I will let you guys know when it is lunch time. The next challenge starts tomorrow. Prepare yourselves. Today was a cake walk. 

Im not asking for help. I know I will probably die, but I want to finish this out. That is why I am not posting this on my facebook or alerting anyone I know. People are paying 50 grand to watch this, but I figure I might as well entertain you with the written version. 

One down. [Three more to go.]

<TEXT> The soft sound the rain makes when it hits the window next to my face has helped me calm down just a little, but I am still a nervous wreck. 

I have been straight edge my whole life. Never drank a drop of alcohol, took a drag out of a cigarette, or taken any type of illegal drugs, but the past couple of months have been stressful. Two months ago, I smoked my first cigarette and loved how relaxed my body felt and how light my head was. Two weeks after that I drank my first beer with my three roommates (Jay, Richard, and Peter). The taste of it was terrible, but once I started to feel a buzz I grew to appreciate the taste of the lukewarm PBR.

Over the course of the next 45 days I continued to smoke cigarettes and drink beer, but I really never crossed that line. They tried to pressure me into trying some of the drugs they managed to find, but I just never really had an interest until Jay brought home some coke three days ago.

He was smiling from ear to ear when he dropped the sack full of yellowish-white powder on the table in front of me. With a bit more excitement than usual Jay looked at me and said, Okay. You wont do acid, weed, or shrooms, but you gotta try coke at least once. Just do one small line, and I will never ask you to try another drug again. 

I tried telling him I wasnt interested, but he ignored me and used his credit card to take out some coke from the bag. He then crushed it with the back of his card and spread them out into two small identical lines. I sighed and sat down on the ground next to him while he pulled out a crisp twenty dollar bill. While I stared down at the lines I saw Jays face lean in close to mine as he stuck the rolled up bill into his nose and snorted up the first line. 

He rubbed his nose and handed me the bill. With a sigh, I stuck it in my nose and snorted the second line. 

From the second the powder went up my nose I felt a rush of excitement. I wasnt addicted right off the bat, but damn, I really wanted to do another line. Jay laughed when he saw my face and asked, So Im guessing you like it. Just toss me 40 and I can give you half of the bag. Just dont go doing it all at once. That line I gave you. Do one that size, but dont do more than 3 in an hour. Gets a bit risky after that.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my wallet out of my pocket and tossed him 40 dollars and eagerly watched him scoop up half of the powder and put it into an empty Altoids tin. He handed the tin to me and I took it into my room and put it on my desk. 

Over the next two days I went through it all. When I asked Jay when he was getting some more he laughed and said about a week from now. I tried to not look disappointed but he gave me a solid pat on my shoulder and said he was heading out to pick up some molly. I gave him a nod and walked back into my room.

I sat on my bed and played around on my phone for a couple of minutes. My eyes started to droop after a couple of minutes so I just leaned against my headboard and closed my eyes. It only felt like a couple seconds passed by but I woke up to Jay shaking me awake and Richard and Peter standing by my door laughing about how I was drooling. 

With a groan I wiped off the drool from the side of my mouth and slowly got up. As soon as I stood up Jay grabbed my wrist and dragged me into the living room. I tried to ask him what was going on, but I already knew why they were so excited. When we got to the living room I sat on the couch and Jay threw a pill on my lap. I picked it up and looked at it. It was a clear capsule filled about a quarter of the way with pink powder. 

Feeling a bit weird about the pill I asked Jay what molly was supposed to do. Jay opened his mouth but Richard cut him off and said, Dude. Shit is wild. It takes about 20 minutes to hit, but when it does you feel like everything around you is amazing. You want to touch shit and you want to talk. Shit. I even called a couple of girls to come over in 30 minutes. They want some too. I was still a bit confused, but at the mention of girls I got a bit excited and popped the pill in my mouth. 

Within 2 minutes Jay stood up and said, Yo. This shit isnt right. Im already feeling shit and it doesnt feel right. I dont know. Rich. you alright bud? Youre fucking pale right now. He looked at me and started to scream, Dude. Youre foaming out of your mouth. What the fuck is going on?

He was right. I was foaming out of my mouth. Right after I took the pill I started to feel bile come up from my throat. I tried swallowing it down but it only made it come up stronger out of my throat. I couldnt breathe. I tried punching my throat but the foam kept coming out of my mouth. With my last couple of breaths, I looked around the room and saw the other three were lying completely still with the same foam spewing out of their mouths.

It might not be the same for everyone, but right as I died I found myself standing in the middle of a massive room. The floor and the ceiling were made up of gray concrete blocks. The walls were completely covered with thousands of doors. There was a hand on each of the door knobs, and every hand and arm led to one creature standing in the middle of the floor. It was pure black with arms that were completely white. Its head nearly touched the roof that my eyes could barely see. The face was almost invisible to my eye, but that wasnt the source of oddity. It was the arms that started from the bottom of its body to what seemed like the chest area.

The room was completely crowded by other people trudging along the room while some walked up to the creature and tugged on an arm. The creature would then retract its rubbery arm back and scoop the person towards the door the arm was on. 

I didnt know where the doors led to, but I wanted to look around the room and try to find my roommates. 

I walked around the room for what felt like an eternity, but no matter what I saw inside of the room I could not find any kind of answer. I tried talking to the others, but the few that actually talked back to me were as clueless as I was. I watched people walk through the doors but even the same door showed different results; it would go from sounds of melodious harps while they walked through with smiles on their faces to getting grabbed by a lumpy blue arm that ripped the person in half before dragging the person inside one half at a time. 

I finally found my three roommates after walking for what felt like an eternity. They were all sitting together towards the middle of the room. When I walked up to them Peter gave me a small smile and said, You ready to choose your destiny? Confused, I asked him, What do you mean choose my destiny? Peter pointed towards the creature and said, Choose an arm. That is what will lead you to where you are supposed to go.

I gave him a nod and asked, So whos going first? Richard said, Fuck it before grabbing an arm and waited for the hand to grab him. When the creature grabbed him and took him to the door he opened it and instantly the sound of sobbing filled the room. He looked scared as he walked through and the door closed slowly behind him. 

Jay looked at me with a look of worry before walking up to the creature. He nervously grabbed an arm and waited for the arm to grab him up. Right as he was grabbed up by the arm he looked at me and shouted, Up! When he opened the door he stood in front of a high pitched scream filled the room. I could see him shaking as two purple hands shot out of the door and grabbed him. They tore open his mid-section and drug him into the door with his intestines dragging behind him. 

Peter tapped my shoulder and I looked at him. After taking a deep breath he said, Im going to try to climb as high as I can. Go when I go. When I get to a spot I cant reach up climb on top of me and keep going up as high as high as you can. Right after he said the last word he started to climb on the arms of the creature. I followed him.

The arms I climbed up felt like dry jello. The whole time I climbed up I saw the bottom of Peters shoe. Right as we got to the top of the stomach area I noticed I was climbing on top of Peter. I managed to get my feet on his shoulder before I saw the hand of the creature grabbing Peter by the shoulder. I looked up and saw the next arm right above my head. I grabbed it and continued to climb up. Right as I got to the neck area I noticed that the creature did not have a face. It was covered in arms.

Right as I got to the arm at the very top I waited for the arm to grab me. It picked me up and took me to a door placed on the ceiling. I closed my eyes, opened the door and took a step through the door. I woke back up on the couch coughing up the remainder of the foam lodged into my throat. My roommates are all dead. I checked their pulses. 

Before I call 911 and tell them about the death of my three roommates I wanted to write this out to you guys. This may not be the same to everyone, but if you find yourself in a place where the only option is to give up your soul.

<TEXT> Write for yourself. Not everything will get popular, but you never know what will gain more attention outside of Nosleep. We have had stories that don't even hit 200 upvotes but cause a stir on the internet or in towns. 

If you don't find it scary at all. Chances are others won't either. If you feel a tingle of fear while writing it. It is probably scary for the readers. I'm definitely not a veteran by any means, but I love writing and i'm closing in on 5 months writing here. Just stay consistent. Use your main reddit account and have fun! It's amazing when a story takes off and you can witness the comments pummeling in. Get involved with the commentors :) It makes it that much more real for them! </TEXT>

Instead of slamming other writers (Which yes. You did.) Send them a pm. Instead of calling yourself a prolific writer. Humble down and see yourself as an equal. Instead of ranting of negative feedback. Own that shit. I have written many flops, but I own it. Appreciate every aspect of the community you want to write in. 

Nosleep is a community. Get involved. Help others and they will help you. Insult them and you will start to get more and more negative feedback. </TEXT>

Do i keep writing even when self entitiled assholes slam down on my work week after week? Yes.

Does almost every other established writer do the same thing as i do? Yes.

Do you? No. You're just ranting about upvotes in the most petty way possible. You are slamming down fellow writers so you can feel better about your sophomoric stories. So sit down. Relax. Drink your favorite drink and try. Try to be part of the community of writers that help each other. Try to write stories instead of rants on the OOC.

<TEXT> 700 upvotes will not be your peak. Buckling down and biting the bullet would be to continuously write new stories. Making a sequel is more of taking the easy way out. 

Plus, if it has been more than a week since the original. Expect it to be around 20 to 25 percent of what you got on the original.

If you need help let me know by pm. I will do anything i can to help you push out more stories. 

As a newer author myself. I want others to feel the awesome feeling of surpassing more upvotes than you thought. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You may want to roll your eyes after the next sentence but just hear me out. My name is Dave, I am nineteen years old, and I know I will never have another relationship or get married.

You see, around five years ago I just went through my first and only break up. I told my friends I dumped her for a hotter chick, but the truth was. She dumped me for my step-sister, but how was I supposed to tell my friends that? Thats about the most embarrassing thing ever. My step-sister, who was a year younger than me, managed to steal my girlfriend.

Of course, my mother knew about it and was more than supportive to my sister, but she still felt bad for me. She came into my room and put 50 dollars in my hand and asked if I wanted her to drop me off at the mall for a couple of hours. I slowly nodded my head and started to get ready. 

On the way to the mall, I texted my 5 friends and told them to join me. My mother tried talking to me while we drove there, but I just silently stared out the window. When we pulled up to the entrance to the mall I got out of the car and slowly walked in. Before my mom drove off she yelled out, I love you, Dave! I glared her down until she drove away. 

I was there for two hours by myself. None of my friends texted back and I was getting ready to call my mother to pick me up when I saw the prettiest girl I have ever seen. I dont know what came over me. When she walked past me I started to follow her. She looked at me and gave me a smirk before turning around and planting the most passionate kiss I have ever felt in my life. My arms were flailing for a couple of seconds before the feel of her lips, the light coconut scent of her hair, and the warmth of her embrace made me lose track of everything. My arms matched her embrace and I was truly happier than I have ever felt in my life. It felt like days flew by before she pulled away from the kiss. 

She gave me a short laugh before asking, If you liked that. Why not just go ahead and promise to be mine forever? I was a teenager and my teenage hormones were bouncing all over my body. I didnt care how weird her question was. After taking a deep breath I asked, How do I do that? She grabbed my hand and asked, Just say yes and I will do whatever needs to be done. Without a second thought, I answered with a quick, Yes. I want that.  

She gave me a smile before her body started to melt. I shrieked and tried to jump back but my hand was stuck to whatever she had become. Soon she became a puddle. A puddle of flesh that surrounded me. 

Slowly, the liquid started to rise from the ground, and slither up my leg. I tried to slap it away but it easily avoided me and continued to crawl up. I tried yelling but my throat wasnt responding. Instead, I found myself sitting on the bench with my mouth wide open. Whenever I wanted to struggle my own body fought against my urges and kept me still until the liquid started to pour into my mouth. 

The taste of copper filled my mouth and I started to gag, but the liquid kept flowing down my throat. After around 10 to 15 seconds the remaining liquid went into my mouth and I regained control of my body.  

I called my mother and told her to pick me up before I ran into the restroom and tried to puke whatever was inside me out. I threw up my lunch and even part of my breakfast, but the liquid girl stayed inside of me. 

For the next couple of months, I monitored myself, but nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. It still annoyed me seeing my sister making out with my ex but I got over it. For some reason, I was actually a little bit happier than I normally was. I was a lot more outgoing; I started to excel in all of my classes and quickly became one of the more popular kids in my freshmen class.  

Of course, this drew the attention to several girls, which I did not mind. I wasnt really interested, but out of nowhere, a girl named Molly caught my eye. She was shorter than average, blonde, and completely perfect to me. We started to spend more and more time together. I asked her out about a month later, and to my delight, she said yes. That was almost the best day of my life. 

That night, while I was lying on my bed thinking about how hard I fell for Molly I felt something rise out of my throat. 

I quickly closed my mouth and tried to swallow it back down, but the taste of copper came out of my mouth and a small glob of liquid bounced out of my mouth. I jumped out of bed, turned on the lights and looked around the room, but I couldnt find anything there. 

After looking around for a while, I became too tired and fell back asleep. The next morning when I woke up I got ready and my mother drove me to school. When I got to school I noticed something was off. Kids were acting normally until they were stopped by a teacher in the front of the school. They turned around and started to walk back to the car they were dropped off in. I ran up to a kid that was in my History class and asked him what was going on. 

He shrugged and said, They said someone died in our school. I asked him if he knew who it was, but he just shrugged his shoulders again and walked back to his car. Later on, while I was watching the news Mollys face popped up on the screen. I dropped the remote on the floor and continued to stare at the screen and hear about what happened to her. She was found in the middle of my first classroom. She had an envelope in her hand. They were investigating all of the tapes, but all they saw was her stopping in the middle of the class and grabbing at her throat. She fell to the ground and squirmed around for a couple of seconds before her movement stopped entirely.

It took me over 2 years to get over the death of Molly, but for some reason, I felt like I was never truly alone. 

I tried dating another girl, Grace, about three years ago, but I was never really into the relationship. She really tried to make the relationship work, but something inside of me was pulling me away from her. After several months of seeing her suffer I wanted to cut it off with her, but when I walked up to her to break up with her the next day I froze in my steps. This was the girl that really went through months of torture to make me fall in love with her, and I really did start to love the girl. The love that I havent felt since meeting Molly.

I walked up to her and grabbed her close to me before planting a kiss on her cheek. I whispered I love you into her ear and for the first time. She truly looked happy.

The day flew by. After school, we walked around the school parking lot for hours and talked about everything important and stuff that was completely trivial. I loved every single second of it. 

When I got home, I immediately started to text her and we talked until around 1 AM. Right as I put my phone on my side table and started to drift off I felt nauseous. I tried with all of my strength to hold it back, but no matter how much I tried I felt the same taste of copper come out of my mouth. Right as a cup full of goo expelled out of my mouth I jumped right on the spot I thought it landed on but it was gone. 

I tried texting Grace to be careful, but I started to feel the liquid come out of my mouth again. I started choking and tried to grab whatever was in my throat with my fingers but before I put my fingers in my mouth I felt it rush out of my throat. 

It was the girl that I saw at the mall. I tried reasoning with her, but she raised her hand and a blur flashed across my face. I woke up the next morning to a bunch of texts on my phone. They were all about Grace. She was dead. She was found in her room. I called her brother, John, on the phone and through sobs, he described out how he found her. She was lying on her bed. He hands were around her neck. Her face was completely blue. Her neck had several gashes. Her blood surrounded her dead body. He swore up and down that he saw a pinkish liquid coming out of her mouth. 

She was the last one I fell in love with. I have tried everything I can to stay out of the way of anyone I felt like I had a chance of falling in love with. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and see the girl I saw at the mall. The girl that is now a permanent part of me. No matter how many times I have seen her I can not describe what she looks like. All I know is that she is everything I desire in a woman. 

Like I said. I tried really hard to stay out of the way of love, but just the other day, I met a girl. Her name is Amber. I helped her study for her communications exam. She gave me her number and we are going out to a movie. I hope I dont [fall in love.](https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TITLE> Five Pieces of Candy Ruined my Life - Final Update </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-13 16:33:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64ygus/five_pieces_of_candy_ruined_my_life_part_1/)

I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of my phone buzzing. With a groan, I reached over and grabbed my phone and blinked a couple of times to adjust my eyes to the bright led screen. It was a text from a number I didnt know. Still shaken up from the visit earlier by my family members, I slowly tapped on the screen and opened up the text.

*Not sure what Im doing, but here goes. Im the girl at the front counter. Kathy.  I just cant get your face out of my head and its driving me crazy. God. This is so weird but. and I swear. This isnt like what I usually do, but can I come up to your room?*

Pleasantly surprised by the text I replied back and told her yes and went to the restroom to make sure I didnt have any noticeable bed head. As soon as I looked at the mirror I had to do a double-take. I was far better looking than I originally was. My face was completely symmetrical and my body was in perfect shape. There wasnt an ounce of fat visible on my body. The last thing I noticed my clothes were now too small on me. 

In the middle of trying to find another outfit, I heard a soft knock outside of my door. I looked out the peephole and saw a very nervous looking girl standing outside. After a couple of deep breaths, I slowly opened the door and gave her a little smile. 

Slightly stuttering she muttered out, Y-youre the guy that just checked in, but you look a lit-little different. I laughed and told her that I was just a bit tired when I first checked in. She gave me a nervous smile and. Well. You know what we did. I really dont want to give you THAT much information.

She started to fall asleep on my arm after we finished, but I slowly shook her awake and told her that she should leave. After a couple of protesting grunts, she got up and started to get dressed. I told her she was more than welcome to contact me at any time, but she just gave me a chuckle in response. After she put on her shirt she turned to me and the moment I saw her face I knew I was fucked. 

She was still chuckling but her face was scrunched up from what seemed like various emotions running through her. I got up from bed to ask her what was wrong, but she pushed me back on the bed and pointed at me. She was trying to say something but she let out a loud sob while giving me a smile. I looked away for a second and looked back at her right as she started to laugh while her face was fixed into a frown filled with sorrow. Tears were dripping down her face as she continued to fall into a more and more intense laughing fit. I tried to help her, but every time I got close she would just push me back down. 

I know it was just a smaller woman acting completely bat shit crazy, but I was completely scared out of my mind. I closed my eyes and covered my ears. After a couple of minutes, I heard the sound stop. With caution, I slowly turned my body around and saw that she had stopped moving. Without a second thought, I called 911 and reported a death in my room. They told me to wait there, but I couldnt handle it anymore. 

I ran out of the hotel and caught the first cab. He asked me where I wanted to go and I quickly said, Raleigh.  He looked back at me and asked, You know how much thats gonna be right? Thats about an hour and a half drive. I gave him a nod and leaned back into the chair. He shrugged his shoulders and started to drive. 

The driver was quiet for the first five minutes so I started to daydream about being back at home with my family. My thoughts were disrupted by the sound of the driver coughing. I looked up and his eyes met mine before he asked me, Now dont get me wrong, but damn man. You are about the best looking guy I have ever seen in my life. Do you model? When I didnt reply back to him he just kept talking to me about how handsome I was. 

Around 30 minutes later he chuckled and said, Hell. If I was into dudes I would be all over you. I let out a nervous laugh and said, Thanks, man. It was silent for a little longer before the driver stopped the car and parked it in the middle of the highway. I started to ask him what was wrong, but he just turned around and asked me, How about this. You give me some pleasure with that pretty mouth of yours and Ill just give you the ride for free. He gave me a mischievous smile while putting out his hand urging me to shake it. 

Shocked, I looked at him for a couple of seconds before replying back, Im okay man. I just need to get to Raleigh. Ive had a rough day. He gave me a nod and turned around and continued to drive. He was completely silent for the rest of the ride. 

As we got into the first rest area past the Welcome to Raleigh sign I handed the driver two hundred dollars and told him to keep the change. He grunted thanks and I got out of the car. While I walked up to the building I heard him calling after me. I turned around and saw the taxi driver holding a gun to his head. He yelled out before pulling the trigger, If I cant have you. I dont want to live. Its not worth it. As the sound of the gun went off, I ran into the rest area and sat on the ground next to an outlet for the next 2 hours. Trying to think of someone to contact, but I already knew I did not have anyone else I could trust. 

After I charged up my phone I walked out to the street where the bus stop was and silently waited with the others. 

That is when an unbearable heat started to come from my pocket. I reached in and took out the candy and threw it on the ground, but they wouldnt leave my hand. I tried everything from shaking to scraping it on the ground but nothing worked. 

I should have been in pain, but all I could feel was raw anger. Anger that was building up since everything started to go to shit and the good looks that I never asked for. I wanted to be ugly again. I just wanted my life back. 

The bus came and I sat in the middle of the bus. I didnt know where I was going but I knew I had to be on this bus. I dont know why, but there was something I just had to do. 

I finally figured it out after the fifth stop. A happy little shit got on the bus. He looked around and saw that the only available seat was next to mine. He walked up to me and asked me if he could sit, but I spat back, Cant you just stand? He shrugged and jumped over me and took a seat by the window. I dont know why, but all of my anger was directed at him for the rest of the ride. I kept digging my elbows into his ribs as well as accidentally stepping on his foot. Right as he started to ask me to stop hitting him I experienced the worst smell of my life. It was coming from his mouth. I gagged and said, Cant you take care of your breath before talking to someone? 

He became quiet and stared out the window. The candy started to get cold and I took them out of my pocket. I ate one, but there was still five in my pocket. There wasnt any time to second guess myself. When the bus got to the last stop I threw the candy on the guys lap and rushed off of the bus. 

Im in a hotel now. The candy has not returned. Im still good looking, but people are not freaking out or killing themselves over me. Its a fresh start for me now. Hopefully, the next guy will figure out what he [has to do.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TEXT> yeahhhh. don't open that shit. next thing you know you're staring into the soulless eyes of dolls staring back at you. You start to slowly close the door when one of the dolls catches your eye.

It looked almost exactly like the little sister that went missing just 2 weeks ago. The sister that never seemed to get along with your girlfriend. 

You walk into the closet and take a closer look at the doll, your heart stops for a second. The skin. You've felt it before. It was the same skin that held your hand when you walked around the mall when you were little. The same skin that embraced you when you were dumped by your first love.

You slowly close back the door and put the padlock back on. You turn around, and there is your girlfriend. smiling at you, but not the smile you're used to. lips slightly curved upwards in the shape of the bloody knife she holds in her hand.

<TEXT> Have you ever had something simple ruin your entire life? 
 
Im talking about something so minuscule that you would never have guessed that anything terrible could ever occur from said item. 
 
For me, 5 small pieces of hard candy did just that. 
 
This morning, I was running late, but managed to get ready and caught the bus before it drove away. Panting and sweating, I walked to the middle of the bus and sat down next to an older woman. I plugged in my headphones, leaned back, and started to enjoy the beginning of my 40-minute ride until I felt a sharp finger jab me on my side. I yelped and looked over at the old woman. She was looking at me with the most disgusted look possible. She started to say something so I took my headphones off and said, Excuse me?
 
With an agitated sigh, she cleared her throat and said, If youre going to sing along with your music please make sure you brush your teeth in the morning. I can smell your breath all the way over here. The people behind me started snickering and I muttered a half-hearted apology before plugging my headphones back in. 
 
Twenty minutes go by and the woman gets off and squeezes by me. Before she starts walking towards the door she reached into her pocket and threw 5 pieces of candy at me. Annoyed, I tossed them under my seat and just looked out the window until the bus arrived at my spot. 
 
Oh. Before I forget, let me introduce myself. My name is Simon and I am a waiter at a seafood restaurant. I am 28 years old and I live at my parents house. They dont really mind. I pay my share of rent as well as buy my own groceries. I come back home at reasonable hours, and I was never one to start any type of trouble. I do have the money saved up to move out and get my apartment, but there really is no reason. I have enough space in my room, I have never had a serious relationship, and Im pretty sure I never will. Not trying to be negative or anything. Just truthful. Im fucking ugly. Not your average ugly. I am the guy that actually creeps you out just by looking at you.
 
Horribly misshapen teeth, eyes that look like they are about to pop out any moment, acne all across my face as well as neck area, and hair that is already half balding is just the beginning of my physical flaws. Not trying to sound clich, but I do have a great personality. That is why I am so good at being a waiter. 
 
I love my job. It wasnt my dream job, but it is gradually becoming something that I am very passionate about. My tips are always great and I get to meet a lot of people from around our city. Most are nice, but of course, there are some people who are rude throughout their entire meal and refuse to tip. Its just all part of the job. The good always makes up for the bad luckily.
 
So, back to what started happening 2 days ago. I got off the bus and started to walk towards the restaurant, Crackin Crabs, and felt something rub against my jeans. I dug into my pocket and pulled out the five pieces of candy the lady handed me. Curious, I put the rest of the candy back in my pocket except one and held it up to my face. It was orange and had a clear plastic covering over it. Shrugging, I opened up the wrapper and popped the candy into my mouth. 
 
It may sound really dumb for me to say this, but holy shit, that candy was the best tasting candy I ever ate. It was orange flavored, but there was so much more depth to the taste. The strong aroma of a peeled orange enveloped my mouth. This is kind of awkward and embarrassing to say, but I puckered up my mouth and sucked as hard as I could. Before I knew it, the rest of the candy dissolved from my mouth and flowed down my throat. 
 
Disappointed about the candys early dismissal, I walked into the restaurant, clocked in, and started to work. It started off normally, but gradually I started to notice the other workers staring at me. Not of disgust but of genuine curiosity. I didnt really know why they were staring at me until a customer I was serving asked me, Man. I mean this in the straightest way possible. You are about the best looking guy I have ever seen! I gave him a laugh and rushed to the restroom. 
 
The reflection looking back at me was me, but not really me. It was a perfect version of me. Teeth were completely straight, hair was styled perfectly, my face was crystal clear of any imperfections, and the rest of my body looked to be much more fit. Curious, I lifted up my shirt and saw that my slight pudge was now an immaculate six pack. Everything on my body was completely defined. I looked down my pants and gave a little chuckle when I saw the unexpected growth.
 
Should I have been curious about what happened? Absolutely, but put yourself in my shoes. This was the first lucky thing that really happened to me. I was finally confident to talk to people, and I was finally somewhat happy.
 
With confidence, I walked through the door and worked the rest of my shift. As I was grabbing my jacket from the break room a cook that recently laughed in my face after I asked her out on a date, Janet, nervously walked up to me and asked me if I needed a ride. I gave her a smile and told her I was fine. 
 
After giving her a nod, I started to walk towards the bus stop when I heard someone scream out, No! I quickly turned around and saw Janet running full speed at me. Panicking, I took off running and didnt stop until I got in the middle of the others waiting on the bus.
 
She didnt stop running until she tried grabbing me, but the other people started to push her off of me. The whole time she kept yelling, **You cant look like that. Youre not supposed to look like that.** She grabbed a knife from her back pocket and tried to throw it at me but luckily they had her down on the ground. They all tried to fight for the knife, but in the end, she managed to grab the knife with both of her hands before plunging it into her chest repeatedly.
 
The cops came about 15 minutes later. They kept asking me how I knew her and why she would do that, but I kept telling them the same thing. I dont know. After going back and forth for about 40 minutes they told me to not leave the area and they would contact me if they had any other questions. I gave them a slow nod and they left. The bus ride was the longest ride of my life. I finally acknowledged that my good looks did not come out of luck. It was something else. The candy, but why did the old woman give me the candy? 
 
The bus came to a stop and I looked up and saw that it was my stop. I got off and walked up to my house. When I walked in I noticed that my parents were asleep on the living room couch. They did that every night. 
 
I started walking up the stairs when I heard my dad wake up and ask, Now what the fuck do you think youre doing here? 
 
Confused, I looked at him and asked, What do you mean dad? Im just going to my room. I have to wake up early tomorrow for work.
 
With a grunt, he got off of his couch and walked up to me. I stood still but flinched when he raised his hand at me. Instead of hitting me, he just grabbed me by the shoulder and threw me out the front door. As he closed it I heard him yell out, Dont you think you can ever come back in here you evil piece of shit. You hear me? I hate you. You are worthless and you will never be anything. Go kill yourself, because sooner than later. We will come kill you.
 
I was confused as well as hurt. My father always treated me well. He was the last person I ever thought would say he hated me. Im in a hotel now, I got a free room. The woman in the front counter blushed while telling me that she will cover the cost for me. Flattered I gave her my number and went to my room. After just 2 hours in my room, I am scared shitless. 
 
In the middle of writing this out to you guys, I started to hear several familiar voices call out my name. I got up from my bed and looked out my window. Everyone I loved, my uncle, aunt, father, mother, and my 2 best friends, Matt and Stephen, were staring up into my window. I stuck my head out the window and asked them what they wanted, but they kept staring up at me. My mother had a knife in her hand and rubbed it against my fathers back. My uncle rose up his gun and I ducked out of the way. I sat there shuddering. They were all looking at me with a look of absolute hatred. 
 
I grabbed the rest of the candy and tried to get rid of it, but it keeps coming back to me. I threw it out my window, flushed it down the toilet, threw it out of my door and down the hall, and even tried melting them with my lighter. Nothing works. The candy and the wrapping around it will not melt or truly disappear. 
 
I dont want to eat the rest of the candy. I already have the people I love outside trying to kill me. I didnt want to do it, but I ended up calling the cops. After I told them the address to the building and said I was just filing a noise complaint I hung up the phone. By the time they arrived at the hotel and walked to the spot I described everyone was gone.  So please guys. Im scared. Im stuck with these fucking demonic candies, and I just really wish I never [ate the first one.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TEXT> My grandmother is dead, and it is all because I was dumb enough to do one of those dumb You Are a 90s Kid If You Can Correctly Answer at Least 8 Questions! on Facebook.

 I have never been one to do any of those, but I was bored and the only gateway out of my grandmothers boring house was my grandmothers computer.  

Before I continue, let me introduce myself. My name is Joshua Griffin and I just turned eighteen two days ago. My parents almost never had time for me. They were hardly at home when they were in the US, but for 9 months out of the year, they had to go to Italy and manage the company they set up there. I asked them several times why we couldnt just move to Italy, but they wanted to make sure I went to Dartmouth just like my mother and father did. 

Theyre busy people and I get it. Sometimes it would make me sad, but it also gave me a lot more freedom to enjoy my childhood a lot more than most people. They made a decent amount of money; we had our own cooks, our own cleaners, and a person that made sure I was home before 11 pm. I never got in trouble with the law and have always tried to be the best son possible whenever my parents were home. 

After I graduated high school I told my parents I wanted a year off from studying and they were more than understanding. They still sent me money every month to get whatever I needed. 

Two days ago, Harold, our cook, woke me up and told me I only had about 3 hours before I had to be on my flight. I sighed and got out of bed. I got dressed, ate the breakfast he prepared for me and walked out to the car that was waiting to take me to the airport. 

Fast forward 7 hours. I am getting out of the cab and walked up to the front door of my grandmothers house. I knocked on the door and heard her slowly walking up to the door. When she opened the door she gave me a huge smile and gave me a kiss on my cheek. I sheepishly grin at her and ask her how shes been. For the next 40 minutes, I sat next to her on the couch and listened to her rant about how the damn computer refused to work. I laughed and asked her if I could take a look at it.

With a wave of her hand, she said, Go ahead. Just dont break the damn thing even more. I chuckled and walked up to the desk on the far right corner of her living room. Sat at the chair and booted the computer up. 

I turned around and asked her what was wrong with it and she snorted before saying, As soon as I turn the thing on. I get all of these advertisements. They keep telling me what new cream I should buy and pills to grow out something I dont even have. I let out a laugh and asked her if she had anything important on the computer. After she told me that there was nothing on there she needed to keep I unplugged the Ethernet cable and let it fully boot up. 

It was windows 10 so I easily restored the computer to factory settings and plugged the ethernet cable back in before it rebooted. My grandmother walked up behind me when the setup screen came up and gave me a pat on the back while saying, Thank you. Now I can finally check my e-mails without seeing a penis on the screen. 

Right as I finished setting the computer up she told me to come into the kitchen. When I walked in I let out a deep breath. She remembered it was my birthday. A cake was in the middle of the table, and surrounding it was my favorite dishes. I could tell worked hard making the pot roast, baked potato, creamed corn, and deviled eggs.

After filling my stomach with the best meal Ive had in years, I helped my grandma clean up the kitchen and she went to bed around 7:30 pm.

I sat on the couch and watched a couple of Netflix shows, but before I knew it my phone died and I was met with complete darkness. I thought about walking around, but I was feeling a bit lazy so I walked up to her computer and browsed around my Facebook page. It was all the usual stuff. Clickbait lists, friends complaining about politics or whatever, and little videos that tried to make you feel guilty enough to like and share their page. I started to get bored so I went started to close out of the page when something caught my eye.

 You Are a 90s Kid If You Can Correctly Answer at Least 8 Questions! More out of curiosity than anything I clicked on the link and was taken to a bright and colorful page. I scrolled up and down the page and noticed that all of the questions were on one page. There werent any annoying ads so I started answering the first couple of questions.

It started innocently with somewhat fun questions.

Pics of tv shows where you have to guess what show it was from, little toys that were popular, and snacks that only 90s kids ate on a near daily basis. 

After I answered the 10th question I clicked the submit button on the bottom and saw I got 3 out of 10 questions right. 

Slightly entertained, I looked around the page. 

There were several other quizzes on there, but none of them really seemed that fun until I saw something that drew the blood out of my face. 

How Well Do You Know Joshua Griffins Life? The words were on a little icon with a photo of my senior photo. 

Nervously, I clicked the link and it took me to a page with just three questions. 

**What did Josh shoot and kill when he was 15?**

**What did Josh Griffin do to the 21-year-old cook?**

**Does Josh get off on the thought of both memories from the two previous questions?**

Terrified, I tried closing out of the window but a window popped up. It said, Close out the window before answering the questions will result in punishment. Rethink the decision you are about to make.

I didnt want anyone to die so I tried answering the questions.

For the first question, I typed in.

*My older brother. He was trying to kill my parents to inherit their money.*

For the second question, I typed in.

*I threatened her job and everything about her whenever I had the chance, I wanted her to feel as replaceable as possible. She got depressed after a couple of months but I didnt care. People were just an item to me. She ended up hanging herself.*

For the last question, I stared at it for a while before simply typing in, No,

Both of the windows closed down after I submitted in the list. I shut the computer off and walked to the room next to my grandmothers. Throughout the night I could hear her snoring. She was always a loud sleeper. I fell asleep shortly after checking the time and seeing that it was 3 in the morning. The next time I woke up I didnt hear the sound of my grandmothers snore. 

Worried, I got out of bed and checked the time. 

10:15 am.

I quickly got out of bed and went to check up on her but only saw the carcass of what held my grandmothers soul. Her hand was limply off the side of the bed and her head was bent at an impossible angle on top of her chest. 

Gulping down the buildup of saliva and fear, I shuffled towards her and saw that she was dead.

Her eyes that shone like a lighthouse in the middle of the dark seas now illuminated a reflection of a dying candle in the middle of the forest. On the middle of her forehead, there was a series of cuts strategically placed to create a sentence, **One Chance for Truth.**

I will admit it. I get off at the thought of my brothers dead body lying in a puddle of blood. I get off at the thought of how the cooks body flew back and forth with the wind. 

Im a fucked up guy, but my grandmother wasnt. She was an angel caught in the crossfire of the wicked. I want to tell everyone about what I did. The sins I have committed daily, but I will start with you guys. A place that doesnt know who I really am. A place that will never know how messed up I really am. My name is Joshua Griffin and I am the guy that doesn't regret the lives I took, but the [life of my grandmother I lost.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TITLE> My Whole Town Hates My Brother </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-09 17:33:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My name is Matthew and I want to trust my brother, Daniel. He has always been there for me, but he is making it impossible for me now.

As I lie on my bed and slowly type out what has been going on for my whole life I hear my brother slowly whispering to himself, Just take me back to The Lodge. Take me back home. 

We had a pretty normal life growing up in our small town. If you are wondering where we are located, the most I can say as of right now is that we are in Clarksville, Tennessee. Right off of Exit 11. When you get off on the exit you take a left and you will see a heavily wooded section. Drive about half a mile and park your car on the road and walk into the woods. About 2 to 3 miles you will see a sign for Elkview. 

We have a population of around 200 and, of course, everyone knows everyone. We have our own schools, our own doctor, cops, and 5 shops that supplied us with everything that we needed. 

I had an average life of a kid that grew up in Elkview. I went to school all 8 years, fulfilled my 32 hours of work a week while I went to school, and had my 30 minutes of free time with the other kids. I worked at the local grocery store. My job the entire time I worked there was to restock the items that were taken from the bins that surrounded our store. People would come in. Scan the buckets on the ground and take the food they needed before handing the guy at the front one of their vouchers and walking out. We were each given two vouchers a month for each store in our town. Each trip we could take up to 20 items. The doctor was available for whenever we needed him along with our local cop. 

We could go to the doctor or cop as many times as we needed, but any type of false alarm we were punished. We would also get punished if we tried sneaking out more than 20 items on a voucher visit, or breaking any of the 10 commandments stated by the Bible. 

The punishment was always the same. The sinner would stand in the middle of the center point of our town and five randomly selected people would get the honor to throw a rock as hard as they could at the person. This was to beat the devil out of the person. I have been there for 36 stonings. Only 12 people walked away alive. One of them being Daniel. 

He was never the same after the stoning. 

He would still do everything he was supposed to, but whenever we were alone in our room he would sit on his bed and stare at the wall. Softly whispering to himself. 

Sometimes at night, I would see him walking out of the room. Quietly muttering to himself, They will pay. They will learn what is real. They will figure out the truth. Every time I saw him walk outside of our room a dead body would be found in the entrance of our town by one of our guards the next morning. They werent from our town, but it was hard to tell at first glance. The bodies were mutilated and chopped up. It was to the point to where a couple of our elders had to piece them together to make sure they werent anyone that we knew. When pieced together, they were almost always older people with thin layers of worn down clothing. They smelled far worse than death, and none of them ever had anything to identify them. 

I wasnt dumb. I knew it was Daniel getting revenge for the stoning, but I didnt turn him in. I loved him far too much. He was my brother, but it didnt take long for the others to start pointing their judgmental fingers at Daniel. 

He was sent off to The Lodge (a mental hospital about 20 minutes away from us) instead of another stoning because our forgiving pastor allowed him to choose the alternative. 

Daniel was gone for 6 months and our town started to go back to normal. Until he came back. Within 5 days of his arrival bodies started appearing at our entrance. That is when they called the sheriff to our town and they took Daniel away for 3 days. He came back with a smile on his face. A smile that showed the satisfaction of fooling a whole entire time. 

I wanted to stop trusting him, but no matter what, a part of me still clung on to the fact that even the police couldnt find any substantial evidence that he was to blame for the murders of the 21 mutilated bodies. 

Yesterday, was the day I saw, for the first time, parts of a human body lying on the steps that led to the front door of our house, My father was standing by me when I opened the door and as soon as he looked around for a second he yelled out, Stephanie, come out here! My mother came out and let out a short gasp before getting on her phone and called the priest. When he came out here he asked to speak to my brother. Daniel came out of our room and slowly walked down the stairs.

The priest pointed towards the woods that surrounded us. Daniel gave a short nod and they walked into the woods. They were gone for 4 hours. I impatiently waited at the front steps. When I saw Daniels head poking out of the woods I got up to my feet and ran up to him. As I got close to him, I noticed how his expression stayed in the same blank expression. I grabbed his arm as soon as I got to them and led him into our house.

Daniel has been whispering the same thing over and over again.

Just take me back to The Lodge. Take me back home. 

A soft chant entered into our room. A perfectly synchronized group of voices saying, Let your will be done oh Lord. Your will is our mission, oh Lord. Curious, I sat up on my bed and leaned closer to the window. The distant sound of screams hit my eardrums and I made the split decision to go investigate.

I walked out of our room while he was turned away from me. As I quietly opened the door and slid out, I heard Daniel cry out, Matthew. Be careful. The truth will ruin you. You will become like me. Blamed for murders happening in our town. You will be known as a sinner. You will never be accepted ever again. I looked at him one last time before closing the door and sneaking out of our house. 

I followed the noise of the chants and found myself standing behind the local bakery shop. I looked at the center of our town. There was the seal that was there since the beginning of the town, a man holding up a plate full of fruit on each of his hands, along with every adult that lived in our town. In the middle of them were our 4 elders. They spoke out in perfect unison as each of them stared into different parts of the crowd, 

I started listening as soon as the elders started to speak again. 

**This is the last time we say this. Daniel must go. He knows too much. We have sent out people to bring the homeless to our town. We have chopped them up and left them in the entrance to our town, but our youth refuse to believe that Daniel is evil. If they do not believe our town will die. We must get them to believe. They must believe that Daniel is evil and that they must never try to leave the sanctuary we have created for them.**

They were silent and everyone started to walk away from the crowd. 

Without any type of hesitation, I ran back home as fast as I could. 

I managed to get back home before the front door opened back up and I heard whispers coming from my mother and father. They were talking about ways to get rid of Daniel, but they ended up arguing. 

Five minutes later, I heard the sound of my father snoring from their bedroom. 

I am writing to you guys. I tried looking up ways to get support in this type of situation. NoSleep was one of the first things to come up and it has the biggest type of following. Im lost on here. I have only used the internet for my studies, but this may be my only chance at any type of help. Please. If you have any type of suggestions. 

Please [let me know.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TITLE> 300 Years Of Heaven Was a Punishment </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-08 17:31:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My name is Nathan, and I came back after living in Heaven for exactly 300 years. I am sure a lot of people would be curious as to how that felt so let me start from how I got there. 

I tried to be a good person, but my horrible temper always got in the way. It was to the point to where I no longer had friends. My family stopped talking to me, including my own mother, father, and two sisters. I was only 21 years old, but I was truly alone. I tried to blame everyone around me, but I knew, deep down, that it was my own fault. 

Enough of my sob story. 

Let me tell you how I died.

I got off of my shift at the local grocery store and was walking back home. On the way home, a man walked up to me and asked, Hey man, could you spare some cash? I lost my job a couple of days ago and I need to get some type of food for my kids. He pointed at a hungry boy and girl sitting behind him, but I scoffed and said, Not that hard to get a job. Why did you even procreate when youre fucking trash? 

I gave him a quick chuckle and walked past him when I felt pain erupt from my lower back. The next couple of seconds were filled with a knife plunging into my chest. I dont know when I blacked out, but the next thing I remember was opening my eyes and seeing a woman sitting close to my head and saying, Stay calm. Were almost there. Stay with-. I blacked out again and before I knew it I was met by a sense of absolute peace. 

Before I opened my eyes, I knew I was floating. When I opened my eyes I saw myself floating through a fog of memories. 

Through the fog, I could see myself yelling and cussing out my parents a year ago before storming out of their house. That was the last time I saw them. The next thing I saw was the time I was pulled over by the cops with my best friend since we were 6, Brad. He was there for me whenever I needed someone the most, but I took advantage of that. When a cop pulled us over I took out the 7 grams of coke out of my pocket and threw it on the car seat behind me. 

Brad looked at me with pleading eyes while the cops cuffed him, but I acted oblivious to everything.

I closed my eyes again and did not open them until I felt solid ground under my feet. With a deep sigh, I opened my eyes and saw around 20 to 30 people standing in front of me. I looked down and saw that we were standing on a clear glass of some sort. When I looked back up I saw that I was next in line. I rushed up to a man that stood in front of the largest gate I have ever seen in my life. The gate was simple, but it looked to be made of solid gold. After ogling at the gate for a couple of seconds I looked down at the man in front of me. He was maybe a little over 4 feet tall, poorly maintained facial hair that covered half of his face, and eyes filled with sadness and disappointment. 

I opened my mouth to ask him who he was, but before I could get a sound out he spoke in a raspy voice, Nathan Cliff, enter through the gates. Although I was confused, I rushed through the gates and looked around. A road paved with gold, bodies made of solid light walking around everywhere, and other people walking around with dreamy expressions on their faces. 

Besides the people that walked around me, everything around me was a mixture of absolutely pure light. Something far brighter and crisper than anything I have ever seen. The only thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was a man dressed in all red with a piece of paper. Written on the piece of the paper was the date. Somehow, whenever the man flipped the paper over it gave the date of the next day, and an endless swarm of people surrounded the man. 

The first 50 years passed by quickly. I met a lot of other people, we talked about our lives, but I quickly became bored. You can only talk to so many people before their lives start sounding the same. We never grew hungry, tired, or thirsty, but it never ended my cravings. I wanted to get a good nights rest. I wanted to eat just one carrot and savor all of the taste. I wanted to quench a thirst with a cool glass of water, but all we had was each other and those damn angels that never said a word to anyone. 

For the next 110 years, I reflected back on my life. It may seem like a long time to think about 21 years of life, but you can learn a lot more about your life just by revisiting the same memory thousands of times. You learn to see things in more than just your perspective, in ways much more than the words said. 

It took me 160 years to finally snap. I dont know what came over me, but I wanted to leave this place. I wanted to go to hell. Anything would be better than here. 

This is when everything around me started to fall apart. 

It started with me walking up to the bodies of light we called the angels. I tried talking to them, but they never responded back to a word I said. When I truly became desperate, I tried to attack them in any way possible, but anything I struck them with would just go through them. With every attempt, they just looked at them and said the same thing. Keep searching. Keep walking. For you will find the answer.

Eighty years have gone by since then, and all I have done was failed attempts of attacking other angels as well as asking everyone else if they knew what the answer was. Everything was a failure. I started to give up hope, but I started on the longest journey of my life. I turned around and started running as fast as I could. 

I would still see the man flip the sign over and tell us what the next day was. It was annoying at times, but it was really the only thing that kept me from going insane. 

55 years go by. 

It is now my 295th year in Heaven, and I started to see the gate I walked through three lifetimes ago. 

Three years of constant running and I dont feel like Im any closer, but the scenery around me changes. I am now surrounded by body parts and blood lying all around where I run. I came across a couple of heads, and whenever I see each one I stop running and asking them what happened. Each of them said the same exact thing, Dont look for the truth. The truth wont help you. Endure the punishment. It only gets worse from here. I started to get scared. Not just scared for my life. This was far more. I was scared for my soul. The part that will never die. The part that will suffer for all eternity. No matter how bad we were cut up, sliced open, or just cut into dozens of pieces like the people around me now, I would not be able to leave. This was a punishment that will never end.

After three years of running and hearing the same thing over and over again, I started to second guess myself, but I needed to know. It was beyond curiosity. I was trying to get out of the eternal suffering I ended up in. 

Two years later and the start of my 300th year I approached the gates. I walked up to the man that stood in the front of the gate and fell to my knees, a defeated man. He looked at me with the same eyes that were filled with disappointment and sadness before saying, Nathan Cliff. Poor Nathan Cliff. 

I begged him to let me out. To let me leave, but he simply said back, Learn the truth and you may leave. 

In between heavy breaths of panic, I replied back, They told me you would tell me the truth. Or that I would find the truth on my way here.

He simply said back, You know the truth.

I said the first thing in my mind Is this Hell?

He chuckled and said, No. You are in Heaven, but what makes you think Heaven is for the good? You left the paradise created by God. The paradise ruined by us. We can blame the devil all we want, but we are the ones that continue to do wrong. Do you think Lucifer continues to spread his lies to the people when the lies are spread for him?

I wanted to argue with him, but deep down I knew that was the truth. Humans are truly what ruined the world God made us. Lucifer may have tempted us, but we are the ones that truly ruined it. 

I woke back up and saw the woman that was talking to me before I lived through the scariest experience of my life. 

She calmly said, Dont worry. Youre back now. Dont go on us. Were almost there.

I knew she was mostly saying it for herself, but I gave her my best attempt of a nod. She put the defibrillator back down and we were silent for the rest of the ride. 

Im in the hospital now. 

I learned that I was dead for 45 seconds. 45 seconds that created exactly 300 years for me. 

Im on my phone now. The doctors are done treating me. Pain is still erupting all over my body, but man does it feel good. I have a tray of food in front of me. 

Carrot sticks that I never liked, but it is bursting with flavor for me. Water that is quenching my parched throat, and after I post this experience to you guys I am going to enjoy a [good nights rest.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TEXT> I do know that LoS actually will remove stories for beeing too "NoSleep" which is great because it makes it a completely different sub, but I feel like this is a great idea.

2 suggestions:

1) Ask the moderation team of NoSleep to see if any of them would like to help you mod your sub. Just so that way you can make some type of connection piece and not be seen as a place that is trying to take subs from NoSleep.

2) Make sure you find someone that is proficient at CSS (or if you are then even better)

Good luck! I was actually thinking of starting one very similar to this! </TEXT>

<TITLE> I Am Responsible For the Death of Nine Students </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-06 16:07:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My name is Ben and I am responsible for the death of nine people. I was never placed with the blame, but I was just informed by a phone call that 4 students were now on the run. They were all wanted for the murders that took place yesterday. 

Of course, I was not going to turn myself in, but there must be something I can do to help those four students and somehow stop the murders. 

Two days ago I was walking around downtown looking for a job. I was fired from my last job about 3 months ago. I was broke and living at my parents house at the age of 33. Before you point your finger at me and call me pathetic for not being able to find a job let me explain myself. I have been looking all around my city for a job. I scoured online, filled out and submitted hundreds of applications, and even called back every single place that interviewed me and thanked them for giving me a chance.

Despite all of the work I put into finding a job, I was never offered a job. 

That is why when I saw a Now Hiring sign on the window of an older building I rushed into the entrance and maintained my composure before walking up to the counter placed in the back of the store. There were around 20 to 30 gray shelves splayed out randomly throughout the store. They looked rather newish, but the rest of the store looked to be plagued with age. The carpet was white with what seemed like hundreds of differently sized brown spots. Half of the paint was peeling off of the walls, and the air even seemed somewhat antique. 

When I got up to the counter the man slowly looked up at me with a frown set on his face. He looked me over before saying, What do you need? I stuttered back, W-well I saw that you guys were hiring. Um. I was wondering if you were still looking for someone. He looked back up at me and showed what may have been his version of a smile, but to me, it just looked like someone showing a brief moment of happiness in between waves of depression. All of a sudden, it felt like someone cranked up the heat. I started to sweat and I readjusted the collar on my dress shirt before looking back at the man with mock confidence.

After a couple of seconds of awkward silence, he stood up and held a clipboard out to me. I took it from him and looked down at what was written on the piece of paper. 

**Application of employment**

**Name: _____________**

**Upon hiring. You are required to stay at your position until someone can take your place.**

**Termination of the contract is strongly advised against.**

I looked back up at him with a look of confusion. He saw the look on my face and let out a short chuckle before saying, Just write down your name. The starting pay is $3500 a month. You pretty much get paid for sitting where I was sitting. 

Thinking about the money and becoming overwhelmed with the thought of 3500 a month, I shrugged my shoulders and signed the contract. He looked up at me with tears in his eyes and said, Good luck before running out the door. 

Confused, I tried to follow him out, but when I tried to open the door it would not budge open. I tried slamming on the door, but even as people started to walk by the door they continued to walk past the door without acknowledging my presence. Starting to get desperate, I took out my phone to call my parents, but my phone did not have any type of signal. I tried to call 911, but it was silent whenever I tapped on call.

It took me a little less than an hour to get desperate. I started to knock down the shelves and broke pieces off of them before slamming the broken pieces against the glass windows. No matter how much I slammed against the window the window did not break of even crack. 

Desperation hit me at around 3 hours. I yelled out as loud as I could at whatever could hear what I was saying. I tried climbing on top of the shelves and reach the ceiling, but every time my hand got close to the ceiling the ceiling would feel like it was moving up to avoid me. 

Five hours later the sun started to set. I gave up and sat down on the chair behind the counter. There was a computer on top of the desk. I tried to go through any type of social media, but everything was blocked. The only thing that came up on the screen was a program called, Moore. All it led to was a blank page. I kept it up and put my head on my arms and slowly drifted off into a fitful sleep. 

I was woken up by a beeping coming from the computer. I slowly lifted my head while rubbing my eyes and stared at the computer screen. Someone/Something was slowly typing out a message. It took around 2 minutes before I could fully read out what it said.

**David Moore. Pull up your Facebook page and post this as your status.**

*Henry Stevens has been following me after class every day. I tried asking what he wanted, but he has been silent while he continued to follow me. Hes following me now. Wish me luck I guess. Hope this creep doesnt try to kill me.*

I read it over three times before I double clicked the browser and saw that a profile was already up. It belonged to me, but everything about it was different. It said I lived in Blacksburg, Virginia. I worked part time at Teaching Other Students the Truth. I was a student, but it did not state the college it just said, Its Kinda Obvious Where I go to College.

I started to close out of the browser when the page popped up with a new message.

*Close out the browser and we will take a life.*

I tried to reply back on the screen but it would not register anything I typed. 

I know I should have just ignored it and continued to sit on the chair and wait for the next person to walk into the building, but I panicked. 

With shaking fingers, I typed out the status and submitted the post. 

Afterward, I clicked out of the browser and turned the monitor off before getting off of the chair on slept on the floor. 

This morning I woke up to what seemed like and alarm. I instinctively grabbed my phone and swiped my hand to the right, but when the sound didnt stop I slowly got up and looked at the computer. 

There were two messages on the page on the screen.

*Write out an emergency alert about these three students wanted for murder. Rachel Lavene, Henry Stevens, and James Robert. You must make type them out individually and send them out to the designated TVs, and write out a separate message to Tamara Johnson. Tell her that it is time. She must follow the three students running towards the parking lot. If you do not send this out we will take an additional 8 lives and you must send out a message to them that they are responsible for 9 lives instead of one.*

*You have failed to meet the time limit. Eight more lives have been taken. Do not make us take more. You have 20 minutes to send out the messages.*

On a small window placed next to the page, it showed a news segment about how 9 students were found beaten to death outside of the campus cafeteria. 

Without a second thought, I opened up the browser and saw four little icons on the screen. There were names underneath each icon. 

Rachel Lavene, Henry Stevens, James Roberts, and Tamara Johnson. I wrote out a message to each of their icons accordingly to the command given to me by whatever was typing to me. 

As soon as I wrote out the last message I heard the front door opening. I looked up and saw a man around my age trudging slowly into the store. 

He walked up to me and looked nervously at me. 

I looked at him for a second and wanted to tell him to run for his life, but I was selfish. I wanted, no needed, to get out. With a mixture of depression, fear, and happiness I stood up and handed him the clipboard with the application form. He took a glance and gave me a look of confusion, but with the same mock confident voice I discovered just two days ago, I told him, Hey man. It pays 3500 a month. Salary. Nothing to lose with that deal. I pretty much got paid for sitting on the chair. 

He gave me the same shrug I gave to the last guy and wrote his name on the paper. 

I set the clipboard on the counter and told him I was going to go take a smoke break. I casually walked up to the front door and when it opened, I ran as fast as I could back home. I looked back at the store when I got to the middle of the parking lot and saw that the sign was gone. There was just a completely empty store. 

Im back home now. My parents asked me where I was, but I just told them that I spent the night at a buddys house. 

I slept the deepest I ever slept yesterday night.

I woke up about an hour ago, and I feel completely guilty of the murders that took place. 

Im writing to you guys now. Please tell me what I should do. I really want to help them, but Im honestly too scared to get in the middle of what is going on. Im not a hero. Im just someone that was desperate for money.

This is the log of [Henry Stevens.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/63llqs/it_all_started_with_a_false_facebook_status/)

So please tell me.

<TEXT> I tell myself that life gets better 



But it's hard to remember 



The good times over the bad 



The times of happiness over sad 



Why we get up and continue to live 



Is harder as we have to give 



And never really ever get 



Except a bunch of regret 



But fear not ol' wounded soul 



Life is much better with a bowl

<TEXT> Seriously, thank you so much everyone. You guys have made me go from a very enthusiastic reader, to a nervous writer venturing into a whole new hobby, and now to a semi-confident writer! These past 4 months have been absolutely crazy for me. 

I really never expected any of my stories to get any type of positive feedback or narrated, but now that I am, I am still completely awed by every single positive comment and message. 

So moderators, thank you so much for keeping the rules in place and maintaining a consistency on which stories stay and which stories have to go. You guys put in endless amounts of hours maintaining a sub loved by millions of people.

Authors, thank you so much for being absolute motivators. Without you guys I would have never even started writing. Also, thank you for helping the new writers out. 

Readers, thank you for making this sub as big and as great as it is. Without you guys the authors would never have the positive reinforcement they sometimes need on their stories. 

Again, thank you very much. I really appreciate every single one of you, and NoSleep is a place I never want to leave. </TEXT>

<TITLE> It All Started With A False Facebook Status </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-05 15:46:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello, my name is Henry, and I did not almost kill David Moore. I am just a junior at a larger University in Virginia. I made great grades, I had a job set up for me as soon as I finish college at my fathers company, and I was finally truly happy. Of course, if it continued like that I would not write on here. Im writing on here because Im in the middle of an actual shit storm. A shit storm that I know will not end easily.

It took one Facebook status from a guy that was in my English class but never spoke a word to me. He was the guy that never really spoke to anyone; the guy that just stared off into space during every single class, but managed to ace every single test, paper, and assignment. That is why my blood ran cold when my Facebook wall and messages blew up with people asking me why I beat David Moore within an inch of his life. 

I tried asking them what they meant, but every single person ignored my question and kept asking me how I could be so heartless. It took the police two hours after my Facebook started to blow up to knock on the door to my dorm. I opened the door and they asked if they could come into my dorm. I gave them a short nod. They looked around and took a couple of notes down. After a couple of seconds, an officer walked up to me and said, Turn around and put your hands behind your back. He proceeded to tell me my Miranda Rights while putting the handcuffs on my hands. 

The next five hours of my life felt like it lasted forever. I had an endless amount of questions thrown my way. I tried to maintain my cool, but I still ended up crying 3 times during the interrogation. No matter what I said, it felt like I could not prove my innocence. They finally let me go but told me to stay inside of my college campus in case they needed to find me again. 

That was a day ago. 

Yesterday, I woke up, got dressed, and made myself a shitty breakfast of eggs and toast before heading off to my first class. On the way to my first class, I saw a huge group of people standing by the school cafeteria. 

Curious, I walked up to the group and looked in the direction of everyone else. Bile started to creep up my throat, but I managed to swallow it back down. A woman was lying in an impossible position. Her back was folded back and her head was poking out in between her legs. Her tongue was stapled on the middle of her forehead and her mouth was gaped open with her eyes hanging by the optic nerve. The grass around her was covered with blood.

Some students were taking pictures while a couple of students started to walk away from the scene as the police officers started walking up to us. I followed the students that started to walk away. As I started briskly walking to my class screams erupted from behind me. I turned around and saw the cops beating down the students with their batons. The sounds of screams and bones cracking caused the other students to panic. I ran as quickly as I could to my dorm room. 

When I got to my room I locked my door and sat on my bed while trying to catch my breath. The screaming outside didnt stop for another hour. I tried covering my ears, but the sound of the helpless screams went through my hands and into the very depths of my soul.

For three hours, I sat on my bed, frozen in fear and completely clueless on what to do.

When I finally managed to scoot a little closer to my tv I turned it on and changed the channel to the local news. Nine students were found dead on our campus this morning. There was a camera pointed directly at the location of the incident, but the only thing the chief of police could see was a woman walking up to the cafeteria at around 8:30 (Around 10 minutes before I saw her lying on the ground) and she was lifted up off her feet and folded back. As he proceeded to talk about the other students, around 14 minutes later, being beaten to death by something he could not see the news cut off and an emergency alert came up.

Henry Stevens is wanted for the murder of the 9 students. He is still at large. The police are now on the lookout for Henry Stevens. If you know of his whereabouts please contact the police. Wanted for murder. Henry Stevens.

I dont know why I fled. I dont know why I didnt just turn myself in and try to explain myself, but I felt like that was my only choice now. I grabbed my phone, ran out the dorm, and started to run as fast as I could to my car. 

While I was running I saw a couple of other students running as fast as they could to the parking lot I was parked at. Fearing for my life, I managed to run a little faster than them and ran into my car. I locked the door and started to pull out but a girl ran up to my car and flung herself on top of my car. 

I tried to get her off of my car but she held on tightly. I rolled down my window and begged her to get off of my car. She screamed back with just as much desperation, Please. I need to get out of here. I am being accused of the murder of 9 students. I promise Im innocent. I never did anything. Please. Please. Let me in your car. Without giving myself time to second guess myself I unlocked my car. She jumped in along with another girl and a guy. I drove as fast as I could out of the campus and out of the city. By the time we got around 120 miles out I drove into the parking lot of a local convenience store and turned towards the other two passengers.

The guy was first to speak, Hey man. The name is James. I was about to head out to my class, but there was an emergency alert. They said I was wanted for the murder of 9 students. I dont know why, but I ran as fast as I could to the parking lot. The girl next to him stared at him while he spoke. She looked like she was filled with more rage than all of us combined. She confidently stated, The name is Tammy. I saw MY name on the emergency alert. I knew the most rational thing to do would be to escape as quickly as I could. So I ran to the parking lot. Out of instinct. When I saw the desperation on your faces I knew I found the right crowd. After she said the last word she leaned back and got comfortable again.

The girl next to me looked towards to two in the back and said, My name is Rachel. I saw my name on the emergency alert, but I was scared. I dont know why they suspected me, but I panicked. I ran out of my dorm and saw you guys running. I am on the track team so I managed to catch up to you guys. 

We grabbed a couple of snacks from the convenience store and started driving again. After another 2 hours of driving, I found a clearing in the woods. I slowly pulled into the clearing and continued to drive before parking about a half mile into the woods. We all got out and walked about a half mile before finding a spot to set up camp. 

Im lying next to Rachel while I write to you guys. Please help us. We have been wrongfully accused of murder. 

Im confused, scared, and I dont know [what to do] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I flunked out of my first year of college. I didnt go to any of my classes, instead, I spent the entire year partying and getting fucked up on whatever drug I could get my hands on. 

My entire life I was sheltered by my parents. They never let me do anything that was not according to the Bible. If my friends wanted to watch the newest Harry Potter movie I wouldnt be able to go, because of the witchcraft promotion. If I wanted to go to the mall with my friends I had to give my parents a two-week notice so they could think about it. Nine times out of ten they wouldnt let me leave. 

That is why when I went off to college I went completely insane. I went to any party I was invited to and drank every single night with my roommate on days we did not have anything to do. As the end of the school year, I became desperate for a place to live. I could not spend another day with my parents. I needed my freedom.

So without giving my family any type of warning, I moved into a friends house. My friend (Craig) was reluctant at first, but after days of persuading he finally gave in and told me to move in as soon as the school year was over. When I got to his house I gave him my final 300 bucks and he told me that I had 2 months before I had to start paying him 200 dollars a month. Despite having to sleep on the futon that was provided with the room, I loved it. I still had my freedom and I even managed to find a job at the local Mexican restaurant within two weeks. 

The next three months by and I have never been happier. I was now a shift manager making a little over 10 dollars an hour and I could still go out and go to the same parties I went to last year. Craig wasnt really around most of the time, but whenever he was home he would smoke some of his weed with me and we would relax while watching whatever was on tv at that time. 

For the last three days, everything has gone to complete shit.

It all started with Craig running into my room in the middle of the night. I was doing what a lot of men do in the bed with lotion and tissues around their private area. He sat on the bed next to me for the next twenty minutes muttering the same thing over and over. She keeps yelling at me. She is from beneath our floors. Where we stand. She says she shouldnt be here. After getting over my initial shock, I tapped him with my non-lotion covered hand and asked, What do you mean underneath your floor? Some chick you never called back? He stared at me while muttering that same phrase over and over again. I scooted to the other side of my bed and started to ask him if he could just come back the next morning, but within a blink of an eye he jumped on top of my legs and shouted, She wants me dead. She was never grateful and she wants me dead! He got off the bed and walked out the door and left me confused for the rest of the night. 

When I woke up the next morning Craig was lazily eating a sandwich watching tv. I cautiously walked into the kitchen and grabbed a can of coke out of the fridge and walked into the living room. A couple of minutes of awkward silence later, Craig cleared his throat and said, Sorry man. Smoked way too much weed. I gave him a halfhearted laugh and the silence continued. He got up after he finished his breakfast and said, Got work all day today. You working today? I shook my head and he smirked before saying, Lucky. Dont smoke all of my weed. If you do just toss me a twenty or whatever.

I dont know when I fell asleep. I smoked a bowl and started watching a movie, but I woke up to the sound of knocking. With a jerk, I woke up and saw that it was dark outside. With a grunt, I pushed myself off of the couch and checked the time. 

8:15.

Shit.

The sound of knocking came again so I walked up to the door and opened it, but there wasnt anyone there. While I was closing the door I heard a loud knock coming from inside of Craigs room. I rushed to his room and threw open the door. Right when I heard a blood-curdling scream from all around his room. I tried looking all around his room, but after a couple of seconds of looking around, I heard the front door opening. I slowly walked out of his room and saw Craig looking at me with a confused look on his face. With a sheepish grin, I said, I wanted to find your Sherlock bowl. Mine is all clogged now. He grinned and walked into his room and came back out with his bowl before saying, Ill just keep this out in the living room now. Just let me know if you need to go into my room.

I gave him a nod and he walked into his room. After a small bowl, I walked into my room and fell asleep while watching a couple of dumb YouTube videos. 

The sound of harsh whispering broke me out of my slumber. I looked at the alarm clock and saw that it was 4 in the morning. I slowly trudged out of my room and followed the voices. When I got up to Craigs room I could hear everything being said.

**Craig:** *Leave. Dont leave. You shouldnt be here, but you cant leave. Why do you keep yelling at me?*

The next voice sent a wave of fear I have never felt before. It belonged to a woman, but every word she said was a mixture of a whisper and a scream as well as anger and sadness. 

**Let me go. Just let me go. Why do you insist on keeping me here?**

It was silent after that. I heard footsteps approaching the door so I ran back into my room. 

I couldnt fall back asleep that night. Thoughts kept racing through my head and every couple of minutes I could hear them whispering again. 

Around 9 yesterday morning I got out of bed and threw on a hoodie before walking into the living room. Craig was sitting on the couch staring at the sandwich in his hand. I sat next to him and said with a forced chuckle, Im moving out at the end of the month man. I just found an apartment that will let me move in with just 500 dollars down and Im sure you miss having your personal space. 

He looked up at me and stared at me before saying, You can just tell me the truth. Shit is weird now. You hear the whispering just like I can hear you walk up to my door in the middle of the night. I understand.

With a sigh, I walked out the door and rode my bike to work. 

That whole day I wanted to do the best I could at work, but I was far too distracted. Who was Craig talking to? Why didnt Craig just let her leave? How was he acting so casually about it in the mornings? 

I got off of work around 7 pm and pedaled as quickly as I could and got home around 5 minutes later. Craig didnt come home till 9 pm so I ran into his room and started to look for anything that could answer my questions. 

It didnt take me long. 

As I walked up to his bed I felt a small knock come from underneath my feet. I got to my knees and saw a small gap in between a couple of floorboards. I grabbed a pen from Craigs desk and jammed it into the gap and pulled up. A small section of the floor rose up and I grabbed the front of the section and propped it all of the way open. 

I honestly thought I was going to find a woman in the hole, but instead, there was just a small lunch box. I grabbed the lunch box and slowly opened it before looking inside. 

A thin layer of ash covered the bottom of the lunch box. I closed it back up and started to put it back in the opening when I saw a small piece of paper. 

To mom,

You will always live with me. I have always loved you, but you did not love me.

You yelled at me and told me to become something worthwhile. 

Well, now youre worthless. Youre just powder. 

No one knows where you are. Youre just trash now. Trash in a hole that no one will find.

Enjoy the eternity you will spend in the little makeshift hell I created you.

I dont care if you keep screaming at me.

Because I control you now.

I shoved the note back into the hole and closed it. 

Craig came home a couple of hours later. Hes in his room now talking to his mother and she is talking to him back. 

I tried to listen in on what they were saying from my bedroom last night, but no matter how hard I tried I could not hear anything. 

I managed to sleep for a couple of hours, but when I woke up this morning I felt even more exhausted than I did before I slept.

Im packing my stuff up now. Craig is at work, and I dont want to be here [when he comes back] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> My First Day as a Taxi Driver in Korea </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Date: April 2, 2017**

**Location: Daejeon, South Korea.** 

**Earnings: Approximately $880 USD when converted from Korean Won.**

I moved to South Korea around a year ago. The main reason for the move was because I had a wife and kid and I was not making enough money. Originally moving to Korea was never an option, but one day my mother and father called me and told me that if I moved to Daejeon, South Korea they would provide us with an apartment and plane tickets. They would continue to support us until I started to make enough money to support ourselves. 

When we first got to Korea, I managed to get a job as an editor at a small conference organizing company. The money was not great, but they promised me a raise after working there for a year. 

When they refused to give me a raise after working there for a year, I packed up my personal belongings and quit the job. 

I thought I would be able to quickly find another job quickly but learned that finding a job in Daejeon is almost impossible. 

Three days ago, an old coworker of mine contacted me and told me that a local taxi company he started working would be willing to give me a shot. He asked me if I was interested and without a second of hesitation, I accepted the offer. I know most taxi companies charge an upfront fee to rent the taxi for the night, but the company he worked for was a little different. They just took 20% of your earnings. Which meant they were more selective about the people they hired on, but luckily, my ex-coworker (Jong-Seuk) put in words of praise about my work ethic and told them I was completely fluent in Korean. 

This morning I woke up, got dressed, ate a quick breakfast, kissed my wife and baby goodbye, and rushed out to my car. After I typed in the address Jong-Seuk gave me, I drove the five-minute distance to the office I would pick up the taxi cab. 

When I got there I took a couple of deep breaths and walked into the building. Everything about the building was dirty. The glass entrance doors were covered with a thin film of dust, the carpet in the office was tan with use, and the lady behind the counter was wearing a shirt that looked like it hadnt been washed for months. Ignoring her stench, I gave her my best smile and gave her name. Without a word, she got off of her chair and bent down. She stayed in that position for what seemed like minutes. I started to ask her if she was okay, but she stood back up and handed me a key before telling me the license plate number of the car I was using for the day. 

I gave her a nod and walked outside with the key in my hand. When I found the car I was going to use I got a little excited. 

For the past year I drove around my mothers 15-year-old car, but seeing the almost brand new Kia K5 (Kia Optima in America) I jumped into the drivers seat and started up the engine. After hearing the soft purr of the engine I started to drive around the city and waited for the dispatcher to give me my first job. 

Before I got my first job, I saw an old lady standing outside of an E-Mart (our equivalency to a Wal-Mart). I stopped the car and she slowly got in. She was carrying a small brown bag. When I asked her where she needed to get to she calmly said, Drive me around town. Let me relive my memories. I will give you 1,000,000 KRW (Around $880 USD). I shrugged my shoulders and started to drive around the city. For the first two hours, she was silent. She just looked outside and sighed occasionally. Right as we passed by a movie theater she yelled out, Stop. I slammed on the breaks and she looked at the building before saying, My old high school used to be here. This is where I first met my husband. He passed away thirty years ago. 

I tried to think up of what to say back to her, but my thoughts were disrupted by a soft whisper coming from the back seat. I turned around to see if she was trying to tell me something else but her lips were closed. Yet, the whispering continued. After a couple of seconds, the whispering became a soft spoken voice and then to screaming. My man. My man. My man.

The old woman covered her ears and started to scream at me. I didnt know what she was saying, but I quickly drove away from the movie theater. Once we were out of the parking lot, the voice stopped and the woman was quietly sitting in the back seat again. 

For the next hour, I drove around the other side of the city. As I started to get comfortable, I felt a hand grab my shoulder. I panicked and stopped the car in the middle of the road and turned around. The old woman said, Turn around. I will tell you when to stop. I took a U-turn and slowly drove until she told me to stop in front of a pizza restaurant. 

She pointed at the entrance to the pizza restaurant and said, My husband was found outside of the restaurant he owned. He was stabbed twelve times. I see it is some sort of bread restaurant now, but he used to create the most wonderful meals. People would come from all over the country to see how good his food really was. No one ever left with a sign of disappointment. That is what made it so surprising. I asked her, What happened?

She sighed and said, He was found outside of his restaurant with twelve stab wounds. He was still breathing when the paramedics came and picked him up, but on the way to the hospital he passed away. They told me that the last thing he said was.

She stopped speaking, but a voice came from right in front of me. 

Did you ever eat at my restaurant?

She closed her eyes and slowly took a couple of deep breaths. With a whisper, she said, I can still smell the meals he created. 

Scared out of my mind, I started to pull out of the restaurant. Right as I started to exit out of the parking lot a mans voice screamed out, Stop. I ignored the voice and drove out of the parking lot as quick as I could. 

I was done. I didnt care about the money anymore. I tried asking her where she wanted me to drop her off, but she ignored me and continued to stare out the window. Not really having any other option, I started to drive her back to the e-mart I picked her up at.

On the way to e-mart, she asked, Can you please just go to one last place? I promise it is the last location. I gave her a half-hearted nod and she gave me a weak smile before saying, Take me to Smart City Apartments. 

I plugged in the address into the GPS and drove breathed a sigh of relief when I saw that it was only 3 minutes away. 

Two minutes later, I stopped in front of a red light. We were just 300 meters away. I turned around to tell the woman we were close by, but the moment I looked at her I couldnt help it. I threw up all over her. She was looking at me, but her skin started to flake off of her face. I looked away and took a couple of breaths before I tried opening my door. The door wouldnt open, I desperately clicked the unlock button, but the car was jammed shut. 

The combination of fear and stress overwhelmed me and I started to scream while punching the steering wheel of the car as hard as I could. In the middle of my fit, the woman grabbed my shoulder. I tried prying her hand off of me, but her hand stayed glued to my shoulder. With a voice filled with desperation, I screamed, Please. Just leave. Dont pay me. I dont care. Just get out. She whispered after I stopped screaming. We are almost there. I will leave when you get there. I turned around and looked at her one last time. Exposed flesh littered across her face. Bits of her facial bone were exposed as well as a couple of her teeth. 

Choking back another fit, I turned towards the road, put the car back into drive, and drove the rest of the way to the apartment. 

When we got there I said, Get out. 

She said Thank you and I heard the car door open and close. 

I turned around to see her walk away, but I didnt see anyone there.

Instead, I saw the paper bag still lying on the seat. I grabbed it and opened the bag.

Inside the bag was a huge wad of cash and a couple of small newspaper clippings of just headlines.

**Local Restaurant Owner (Kyungsuk Lee) Stabbed to Death**

**Deceased Restaurant Owners Secret Ingredient was Human Meat.**

**Past Lover of the Cannibal Cook (Kang-Eun Kim) Found Dead Outside of Old High School.**

**Wife of Kyungsuk Lee (Eun-Hae Lee) is Responsible for the Murders of Kyungsuk Lee and Kang-Eun Kim.**
**Eun-Hae Lee Found Dead. Possible Suicide.**

On the last newspaper clipping, I saw in small handwriting. Wait in front of E-mart in the Dunsan area on April 2, 2017. There will be a taxi that will pick you up.

I tried Jong-Seuk, but he did not pick up any of my 4 phone calls. 

The money was nice, but I was still scared out of my mind. 

I dropped the taxi cab back and informed the woman working at the front desk that there was some throw up in the back seat. She gave me a grin and said, That usually happens with our first-time drivers.

It has been 4 hours since my shift ended. 

Jong-Seuk sent me a text 2 hours ago. 

I know its scary right now, but the money is good. You working tomorrow?

I havent responded back.

I dont know what I want to do.

The money is good, but seriously, who the fuck was I [driving around all day] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)?

<TEXT> February 22nd, 2017

Thats the last day I remember. The last day I was Bradley Wills. I used to work as a waiter at an Applebees, but I lost everything. 

All because of a website called www.rebirthmenow.com. 

On February 22nd, 2017 I came back home and sat on my couch while I surfed around reddit. In the middle of looking at a heated argument about Trump on an r/funny post, I got a FaceBook message from a coworker (Johnny).

**Johnny**:*Yo man. crazy website. check this shit out. www.rebirthmenow.com*

**Me**:*That looks dumb as fuck dude haha what am I supposed to do there?*

**Johnny**:*No lie dude. fucking got 5 grand in my account right after I signed up. It told me to enjoy my life more. seriously dude. try that shit out.*

**Me**:*Alright, but if I get a virus Im gonna kill you dude.*

He never messaged back after that. 

Curious, I clicked on the link he gave me and found myself looking at a blank white screen. I tapped on the screen and waited. After a couple of minutes I decided to give up and started to turn my phone off when a single word popped up on the middle of the screen. 

*Wait*

I tapped on the word and it faded away before the screen bounced to a solid yellow screen. A couple of seconds later, a question appeared on the bottom of the screen.

*Are you tired of your life? Tap the middle of the screen 5 times if you would like to have a new life.* 

I rolled my eyes and tapped the screen 5 times while laughing to myself about how dumb of a troll this whole website was. The screen turned black and said, Wait. 

I let out a laugh and turned my phone off before walking up to my room. I sat on my bed and plugged in my charger. 

Thats the last thing I remember. 

When I woke up this morning I looked around my surroundings and realized I had no idea where I was. It was completely gray everywhere I looked. The bed was gray, the walls, the ceiling, my clothes, the tv, and computer were gray. I rubbed my forehead a couple of times and looked around for my phone, but it was gone. The only thing I managed to find was my wallet on the side table. 

It was a lot thicker than usual. I opened up my wallet and found a huge stack of hundred dollar bills. I counted it up before I grabbed the money out of my wallet and threw it on the ground. 

Five thousand dollars. Just like Johnny promised.

I checked the rest of the contents.

It was all wrong.

All different.

The cards were all in the same places I left them. The picture on my id stayed the same, but the name on my id, my credit card, and social security card belonged to another person. The numbers on my cards and social security were different. Not off by much, but still noticeably different. 

While I was looking through my cards I heard a sound come from the computer. I looked at the computer and saw small words on the screen. When I walked up to the screen the words started to get larger until Turn on the TV filled the computer screen. 

Nervously, I walked up to the tv and pressed the power button. The screen turned on and a slight hum filled the room before the tanned face of a news anchorman filled the screen. The headlines underneath his face said, Three missing. Chance Harrison is still on the run. 

I felt my blood rush from my face. The name that was on all of my cards said, Chance Harrison. 

I walked up to my cards and double checked the name and no matter how many times I closed my eyes and looked at the cards again I saw the same name. 

Chance Harrison.

I closed my eyes and tried to remember what happened, but I couldnt remember anything. My thoughts were disrupted by the voice of the news reporter saying, Chance Harrison is still the main suspect for the disappearance of Gregory Taylor, Samantha Wilson, and Ian Andrews. He has yet to be found but Matthew Smith, our chief of police, has stated that the arrest of Chance Harrison is their main priority. It jumped to a photo of me sitting at the bar staring at the bartender, then a photo of me standing in front of the entrance to a hotel staring at a woman exiting a car, and finally to a photo of me walking through a school.

I shut the tv off and sat back down on the bed. 

For the next hour I tried to jog my memories, but no matter how hard I tried to remember I just couldnt. 

The computer made another noise. I looked up and saw words on the top of the screen. Within a couple of seconds, the words expanded out and filled the screen. 

*Check under the bed.*

I tried ignoring the message, but every couple of seconds the computer let out another noise. It kept getting louder and louder until it pierced through my eardrums. No matter how hard I covered my ears with my shaking fingers.

With every ounce of my willpower, I managed to resist looking under the bed, but that is when I first saw it. A man was standing in the corner and pointed at the bed. Panicking, I said, Who the fuck are you? When did you get in here? Why do I need to check under the bed? Can you please. Please. Just help me. 

He let out a sigh filled with depression and disappointment before pointing underneath the bed. I ran up to him and tried to grab him, but before I put out a hand on him he let out a scream. I begged him to stop, but his screaming only got louder and higher pitched until he grabbed his face and started to rip chunks of skin and flesh from his cheeks and lips. 

I fell to the ground, shut my eyes, and covered my ears. With my legs, I scooted myself as far as I could away from the voice. I kept scooting further and further away until I felt the feeling of something soft and cold bump into the back of my neck. I turned around and saw three dead bodies under the bed. The bartender I was staring at had a bottle shoved into his mouth. His face was a deathly blue. The woman that I stared at getting out of the car at the hotel was lying with keys shoved into the middle of her forehead. There was a man. He looked to be in his late thirties to mid 40s with three small books shoved into his neck. 

Im writing to you guys because I dont know what happened. My name is Bradley Wills. Im a server at an Applebees, but Im getting framed. I have dead bodies underneath my bed, but I know for a fact I didnt kill anyone. The man that was standing in the corner of the room is gone, but I can still hear him screaming. 

The computer is letting me use all of the websites, but I figured writing on here would be my best bet. I checked on www.rebirthmenow.com again, but it is not a page anymore. 

Please help me. Im not Chance Harrison and Im [not a murderer] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> My Third Life is Leaving Me Unfulfilled </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-30 16:18:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My name is Jacob and I am living my third life now. 

Let me explain myself. 

In my first life, I lived an unfulfilling life. I worked my whole life. My wife died when I was 40 and we never had a child. 

Before I knew it, I was 62 years old walking around the woods that surrounded my house. My whole body ached with each step, but I wanted to move around as much as I could before I lost the ability to walk. 

That is when I heard the south sound of nature beckoning me when I started heading towards my house. I stopped and turned around. The wind slowly guided me further and further into the woods. As I kept walking I could feel a soft vibration spread across the ground around me. I closed my eyes and let the vibration slowly move up my body. With a satisfied sigh, I sat on the ground while closing my eyes and finally felt like I was at peace. 

When the vibration stopped I opened my eyes and saw that the trees that were once in front of me were now gone. I was sitting next to a body of water. Water so clear that you could stare into the endless pool of water before I could second guess myself I plunged myself into the body of water and sank deeper and deeper into the water. 

When I couldnt hold my breath any longer, I opened my mouth and found myself sucking in air. Confused, I forced my eyes open and looked around. 

I was back in my room. 

The strange thing was that before I walked up to the mirror I knew I was 32 years younger than I once was, but instead of feeling happiness, I knew that my life was not going to get any better than it once was. I was in debt to whatever led me to the body of water, and for the extra years I was gifted. 

My second life flew by just as quickly as my first life, but this time I couldnt really marry anyone or show myself to anyone in our town in case I was recognized. The first 5 years went by without a problem, but by the time I was 35 I started to see a shadow stand by wherever I was. It didnt really do anything at first. 

Just observed. 

10 years later, the shadow finally slid towards me and whispered, Go down to the village. You will find a woman in the neighborhood bread shop. She will listen. It floated back and stared at me. I tried asking it what it was talking about, but it just rose up an arm and floated to the direction towards the town. 

I dont know why I listened to it, but I had a feeling that was the spirit I owed my life to. With a nod towards the shadow, I grabbed my things and ran towards the bread shop. When I walked into the bread store I saw a simple looking girl in a yellow dress. I slowly walked up to her and started to ask her if she could come to my house, but she cut me off and said, Lead me. Ill follow, but let me pay for my bread first. 

After she made her purchase I started walking up to my house with her following close behind. The shadow kept staring at her and examined her before looking back at me and giving me a small nod. About ten minutes later we arrived at my house and started to walk inside of my house when I noticed the woman walking towards the woods in my house. I closed the door and followed her. 

She stopped walking when she got to the start of the woods and faced the shadow. She whispered, Im ready. The shadow floated to her and expanded itself out until it completely surrounded the woman. She started to scream out in pain. I ran up and stared into the shadow. Her clothes were completely burned off and her skin started to bubble. She grabbed at her arms and ripped chunks of skin and flesh off of them. A couple of seconds later she was completely gone. She was the only one I can vividly remember bringing up to my house. 

For the rest of my second life, I brought up 19 other people up to my house. I dont quite remember them, but I know that I never got used to the way their skin and flesh melted off of their bones before disappearing completely. 

When I hit 62 again I followed the shadow into the woods. He stopped and I stood next to him. The vibration started to take over my body again. I closed my eyes and tried to capture the moment of peace again but it felt different. 

Fake. 

I opened my eyes and saw hundreds of people sitting behind me. People of all nationalities sitting silently waiting for their turn, there were shadows standing silently next to every single person. I looked to my right and saw that the pool of liquid was different. It was a deep red and slowly moved from side to side. I closed my eyes and dove into the liquid. 

I accidentally opened my mouth and felt a thick taste of copper in my mouth. Disgusted, I started to cough and thrash around until I realized I was back on my bed. 

This is my third life now. The shadow has grown larger than last time. 

It is now talking to me a lot more.

Whenever I bring a person to my house it gives a satisfying grunt before saying, Good. I will tell you when there is a new person to bring. 

Every night when I lie down on my bed I can hear it whispering to me. Always dive into the pool. It gets harder but we must be fed. Before I fall into a deep slumber it tells me, The only escape is feeding me. If you need to escape. Tell me.

Im 43 for the third time now. I dont want to die. I constantly feel unfulfilled with my life, but maybe death is an [easier alternative] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TEXT> Hello everyone. 

My name is subject8631 and I have written to you guys before. This time I dont need your help. Instead, I am trying to help you guys by giving you a warning.  

I went onto the NosleepOOC chat like I do every single morning. Basically, its a place where authors and readers come together and talk about upcoming stories, stories they read, and a bunch of different random things going on in their life. I love it. Its a great place where I can explain out the stories I have written as well as offer critiques for other writers. 

One thing about the program we use for the chat is that it has a way where you can make your own room and talk with others privately. I never utilized that functionality. 

Never really had a reason to. 

I had everyone I liked talking to in one massive room. 

Today, I logged into my work computer and decided to check up on what was going on with the other writers. It mostly looked like the regular group of people, but there were a couple of new people. They were mostly asking about what they should do to fix up their stories before submitting, but one user (FearAndDesire) in the chat was being extremely quiet. I asked the others what was up with him, but no one really knew when he even came in. So I tried talking to him until he responded.

*Me: Soooo FearAndDesire. Cool name. what brings you here?*

*Me: Cmon man. You cant lurk here haha. Just say hi and Ill leave you alone XD.*

*Me: Dude. Youre going to get kicked if you dont talk. Do you read Nosleep? Or write? Do you need help?*

*FearAndDesire: #DesiresFulfilled *

Whenever you put a pound symbol before a word or series of words it creates a new room when you enter it. I clicked on the link and went out for a smoke break. 

I quickly forgot about the random user and started fixing up the website I was working on while occasionally glancing back on the Nosleep OOC chat. 

Two hours go by and I start to turn my monitor off to head off to lunch when I see several regulars blow up the chat. 

PrimalWishes was talking about how her childrens father just died in a car wreck and just found her neighbor stabbed multiple times. She told all of us to avoid the chat FearAndDesire created at all costs. She insisted he was to blame for both of their deaths. 

Im sure some of you know the writer that goes by the name of SailorScarlet. When she came back into the Nosleep chat she just typed out. Off work now. A couple of people died in our office. Boss had a heart attack and my friend was too close to a printer that blew up. Ill talk to you guys later.

Curious, I clicked on the tab I opened up before for the chat and read through everything. By the time I got to the [end of the messages I felt myself shaking] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8TIAOejvy-xTDMxenozek5aNTA/view?usp=sharing). 

I know Ive written plenty of stories, but I really didnt know how to approach FearAndDesire. I was scared for the people around me so I logged back in with a fake username and [went back into the chat] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8TIAOejvy-xOG5jZGJIMlp0a2s/view?usp=sharing).

I stopped typing back for a second to answer a call from my father. He was choking back sobs while informing that my mother passed away in a plane crash today. She was one of 30 casualties. 

I should have stopped talking to him then, but I was far too filled with rage for that. I needed to get back at them somehow. If they really fulfilled all of my desires I was going to give them one they wouldnt be able to [come back from]  (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8TIAOejvy-xOWVrVjFobk9KZ2s/view?usp=sharing)

My father had a stroke just three minutes ago. The owner of the company he delivered frozen food for contacted me. He took his last breath before the ambulance arrived. 

I wanted to end them. I really did, but I have lost too much. 

Guys, I know it may sound tempting to go into the chat to check it out, but if you do please do not request anything. I lost my parents. I left before I could lose anyone else. If you just want to talk to me about my experiences stay on the Nosleep chat. I will tell you whatever you want to know. If you have questions pm me. 
For proof go to the [chat room] (https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/desiresfulfilled).

Most importantly, do not think you [can beat them] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> The Bible Has Become My Personal Hell [Final] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-28 16:05:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the first part: [click here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/61s4x5/the_bible_has_become_my_personal_hell_part_1/)

We did not work today. 

Everyone was in a panic. 

We had two men dressed in red robes come in and look around for a couple of hours before they grabbed a deliverer and dragged him into the room the furnace was. Despite the distance, I clearly heard a voice start pleading for his life. When no one was looking I ran up to the door and pressed my ear lightly against it. I managed to catch what they were saying.

Deliverer: I promise. I swear. I dont know what the fu- I heard a slap and my blood ran cold. Two voices spoke at the same time. A low guttural voice that sounded like it belonged in the depths of hell and a completely monotone voice.

Them: Do not use foul language in the temple of God servant. Youre useless. You deserve nothing. You deserve death. 

After that, the deliverer let out a scream so loud I had to pull my ear away from the door. It was the scream of pure agony. I ran back out into the dining hall and sat down next to my elder. He looked at me and asked me what I heard. I just shook my head at him and placed my head on the cold metal table. 

A couple of minutes later, I heard the door open and slam shut. Before I managed to raise my head I heard gasps fill the room. When I looked at the two men in red robes walk up to us I noticed they were each carrying something. The person on the left carried a lump of flesh while the one on the right carried the skin of the deliverer. 

They placed the flesh and skin on a table and started to walk out the door. Before they walked through the door they turned to us and spoke in unison, The food is on the table. The answer for your salvation is on the table. Make use of the blessings we have given you. No more work. No more food. This is now your personal hell. The only way out is through Gods word.

I didnt care anymore. I know a man died, but I needed to get out. So did everyone else. If I have to investigate a dead mans skin I was more than willing. With a deep breath, I grabbed the skin and flipped it over to see what was written on the forehead section.

**Luke 15:11-32**

I called out, Someone get me a Bible. Lets get this shit figured out. 

A girl ran up to me with a Bible in her hand and tossed it to me before running back to her seat. I flipped it to the passage and quickly glanced over it. It was the tale of the Prodigal Son. 

For those who dont know. 

Kid was a spoiled little shit. Asked his rich father for his inheritance like a dumb ass and went to a nearby city and spent all of his money. Ran back home like a little bitch and what do you know. Father still loves him and he lets him go back home and live with them. 

Most Christians know the story, and honestly, it is definitely heartwarming, but how was that going to help us? When I looked back up from the Bible I saw my elder standing next to me examining the bottom portion of the skin. He looked at me and pointed to where the mans right ankle once was and said, These are the only words that are not part of the Bible.

I took a look at it and my blood ran cold.

*Deliverers, elders, and workers. Out of all of you. There will only be one prodigal son.*

Everyone quickly crowded around us and demanded answers. With a shaking voice, I blurted out that they wanted us to kill each other. The last one to survive will get to leave. After I explained it out, I tried to tell them we could all work together to find a way out, but within seconds the dining hall filled with swinging fists and blood. I quickly ran to the other side of the dining hall and saw the transition from people ganging up on one person to taking each other out one by one.

Within minutes, only one deliverer, 3 elders, and 2 workers remained. The mask was ripped off of the deliverer, and I got a good look at her face. It was the one that led me to her room. The one that let me get this message out. I tried to think of a way to help her out, but in the middle of my thoughts, I saw out of the corner of my eye an elder running at me as fast as he could. Without a second thought, I dropped to the ground as he got close and saw him trip over me. Before he could even get up I ran past him and ran to my room. When I walked into my room I saw my elder sitting next to his bed sobbing out loud.

Slowly, I walked up to him and saw blood seeping through his shirt. I grabbed his shoulder and turned him around and tore off his shirt to see if I could help him. Upon first glance, I knew he was far beyond help. All around his midsection his skin was missing and his flesh was slowly bubbling up and melting away. 

With a groan, he looked up at me and said, You need to get out. I didnt want to die. I ran here to escape, but. But. Fuck man. I dont know. My body started to feel like it was on fire. What the fuck are you still doing here? Get out. Get out!

I ran out and saw the deliverer standing in front of my door. She had a knife in her hand and stared at me with a small smile on her face. 

I raised my hands and turned my back towards her and leaned against the wall. She let out a short laugh and said, Follow me. I turned around and saw that she was walking towards her room. I ran up to her and tried to ask her what she was doing but she didnt say a single word back. When she got to her room she lied on her bed and said, I marked an X where my heart should be. I wanted to die on the bed I slept my whole life. With a million questions buzzing around my head, the only one I managed to ask was, Why? She shrugged and said, This is all I know. I was born into this like the other deliverers. We dont know who controls us. If I escaped I wouldnt know what to do. I dont have parents to go to. Why I chose you to survive? Well, that is because you are the only one who decided to sit with me. You are a pig when it comes to good food, but I enjoyed the momentary company. Its time. Do it now.

With a soft voice, I whispered, Thank you and plunged the knife into her heart. I stood next to her until she took her last breath. 

The doors are opened now. 

Before I head back into the world to live or be killed by whatever was leading this workforce I leave you this. 

Religion is a powerful thing. It can be used for something good or something beyond evil. We dont know which is which. The Bibles we made were not for some type of cult. They were for the churches around the Midwest. It was led by a pastor by the name of Drew Harris. 

I lived through 3 years of hell to become a [prodigal son] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TEXT> For the last three years, I worked alongside forty other problem teens between the age of 12 to 17. 

How did I get here? 

I was fourteen and I was caught with a joint in my pocket. It was going to be the day I tried smoking weed for the first time with my friend. 

I was only suspended for a week, but my parents were very religious. They consulted with their pastor, but the only suggestion he could give us was to take me into rehab. We didnt have money for that so my mother grabbed my arm and led me out of the church with my father walking closely behind her. While we were walking to our car in the parking lot a man ran up to my father and said, Rehab isnt the only way! Give me 10 minutes of your time. I promise it will be worth it. 

My father gave the man an awkward smile and started to get in his car when the man blurted out, Its free and we can guarantee that your son will come back as the man God meant for him to be. With a small grunt, my father got out of his car and started talking to the man. I tried pressing my ear up to the window to catch what they were saying, but after a couple of minutes of listening to muffled voices, my man walked away with a satisfied grin on his face. When my father got into the car he said, Aaron, you are gonna have to pack up your stuff up tonight. They are picking you up at 4 in the morning. 

I kept asking him who was picking me up, how long I was going to be gone for, where I was going, but he did not say a single word to me. 

After three years of being in this fucking hellhole, I still dont know why Im here. 

I am not any better person of a person. We dont do anything that benefits our life. I do the same thing every single day. At 6 am I wake up and wake up my elder before I rush to the dining hall. If Im lucky I will be able to eat the same breakfast every single morning, eggs and a piece of toast. After breakfast, we clean our dishes and walk to Truth Hall and spend the next 12 hours flipping through Bible after Bible making sure imperfections were not found. After we inspect each Bible we would put a tiny mark on the bottom right corner of each page. 

Elders are people that turn 18 while they are here. They dont work, but they get punished every time we make a mistake with our inspections. 

Punishment is a little different here. The elder gets nailed to a cross and placed in the middle of the dining room. Everyone else grabs a rock from a pile provided by our Deliverers. As soon as we all pick up a rock we have to throw it as hard as we can at the elder until he dies. If we run out of rocks and the elder is still breathing then another elder gets crucified next to him. The most we had at one time was three elders ascended in the middle of the dining room. 

This morning I woke up a little earlier than everyone else. I got dressed into my outfit, a simple white shirt, white sweatpants, and brown leather sandals. After getting dressed I woke up my elder and ran towards the dining room. When I ran through the doors into the dining room I saw a deliverer sitting at the table alone. I wasnt scared of them because they were the ones that monitored us, punished the elders, and worked for whatever was holding us hostage. I was scared about how they always kept their faces covered with a white mask with the word sinner written in red on the top of the hat. It was also how they laughed whenever we were forced to kill our elders for what something that isnt even their mistake, but the scariest thing about them was how they communicated with each other. It was in a sort of low guttural sound I could not figure out, but whatever it was, it sent chills throughout my body when I heard them speak to each other. 

I tried to quietly walk past him, but he grabbed my arm and pointed at the seat in front of him. There was already a plate of bacon, eggs, sausage, and pancakes. I quickly sat down and stared at the food. My mouth was watering at the sight of good food, and I started to scarf the food as fast as I could into my mouth. Within 5 minutes I was staring at an empty plate of food. A chuckle came from within the mask, and the deliverer handed me its plate of food. I gratefully took it and ate the next plate of food a little slower. After I finished my food the others started to come into the hall. When I looked up to thank the deliverer I stared at an empty seat. 

The day went by normally until the end of my shift. When the bell rang, we all put down the Bible we were examining and went to the dining hall for dinner. I was the third to walk in, but before I walked through the doors I heard screaming. I ran inside and ran to the other two guys that were standing in front of the cross to find a deliverer lying on the ground. The first thing I noticed was that it was a man. As I walked up to him he turned to face me and I saw that the other side of his face was completely burned to a crisp. The eye was nothing more than a puddle of white and black liquid barely staying in place. The other side of his face was filled with words. I bent down and got a closer look at his face. 

They were words I was completely familiar with. 

Scriptures from the Bible.

He held his hand out towards me and started to wail out, *Lies. Lies. Its. Its all just lies. May God deliver you from the evil. May he grant you peace.*

Other deliverers quickly came into the dining hall after he went silent. They dragged him out and disappeared in the long dark hallway. By the time we were done with dinner we saw other deliverers getting dragged into the same hallway.  

The last deliverer was dragged on his stomach and I threw up into my plate of food as soon as I saw its backbone sticking straight up. Strips of meat hung from the bone and the flesh that was around the backbone looked to be bitten off. 

I dont know what came over me, but I ran out of the dining room and started running towards my room when I ran right into a deliverer. When I got up it grabbed my arm and pointed towards the hall the deliverers slept in. I followed the deliverer to an open room and sat down. When I sat down on a chair the deliverer took off his mask and grinned at me. 

A woman was staring at me. She had a face that belonged to an angel, but it was covered by the word Mary on her forehead and several verses of scripture written all over her face. 

When I gained the courage, I looked at her and asked her if she could help me escape. With a sad look on her face, she shook her head and softly said, No. With slight frustration, I asked her, Why? Why cant you help me leave? With tears running down her face she said, I dont know where we are. None of us do. If we dont do as they say we lose our life like you guys do. We arent any higher up than you. We just gain certain perks.

We were silent before I asked her, Do you have anything that can get on the internet? She nodded yes and handed me a laptop from underneath her bed. Before she handed it to me she said, We have tried to get people to track our location, but every single time someone from the outside gets a location they go to the spot only to find out that its useless. This place is untraceable. 

Im writing to you guys for help. Please dont try to find us. Its useless. Just give us suggestions. We need to escape before we all [lose our lives] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> A Letter of Recruitment From Life is Beta </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-24 14:28:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello, most of you havent heard of me, but I work for an organization that has saved your life probably more times than you know. We have all made our sacrifices to work here. 2 weeks ago, I made my biggest sacrifice.

My name is James Green. I am 19 years old and my mother and father passed away in an accident the night before. You know what the most messed up thing about it is? 

I knew about it, but I didnt warn them. No, you cant mess with destiny. Not for something this meaningless to the world. That was a hard lesson for me to learn, but I know I must make those sacrifices to continue working for the organization I love and trust. 

 I work for Life is Beta. 

We prevent catastrophes from happening, but we cannot stop every single death from happening. Thats why I did not tell my parents they were going to die on the way to a housewarming party. Some things are just not worth the time. 

Why am I writing to you guys?  It is because we need your help. What do we need you to do? Well, that varies. You will either be a carrier which is someone that constantly travels around the world (all expenses paid) and stops the disaster from happening. We usually send out 6 to 20 carriers for a single project depending on the workload. 

We also have people like me. We are the tellers.  We hardly ever leave where we live and we only stay in places Grant deems safe. Even though my parents died in a car crash, Grant still recommended I stay there for the time being. It was too risky for me to be seen. 

 We only have 15 tellers in our whole organization and 465 carriers. This used to be enough, but we have lost quite a bit of our people in the last couple of days.

A couple of the tellers, myself included, reported multiple deaths occurring. We couldnt find the source at first, but after Grant dug around he found out that there are other apps. They dont do the same thing as us. Their main focus is to eliminate or brainwash as many people as it could.

They dont keep themselves hidden like we do. We have found 2 apps and 1 device so far [New Eyes] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5y8310/an_app_called_new_eyes_has_taken_over_our_town/), [Time is Money] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5ysv07/an_app_called_time_is_money_gives_you_more_than/), and a [childs tablet] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5yfatq/my_son_is_seeing_things_i_cant_on_his_new_tablet/). The previous 30 carriers we sent out to counterattack the apps have resulted in utter failure. None of them came back. Half of them became obsessed with finding money through Time is Money and ended up being pieced apart by people we couldnt see. Seven of them worked on the boy that told the future from the tablet and ended up on the news the next day. Their bodies were missing, but their heads were found in front of the local Walmart. The final eight never came back. They were still alive, but whenever we contacted them they all said the same thing. You are not part of this. Do not talk to us. We are part of the next world. 

The thing is I did not see that coming. None of the tellers saw it coming. Grant was silent for a while after that. For the first time, we truly felt hopeless. 

Three days ago a teller was found dead inside of her house. Not a gruesome death. Just a shot through the head, but what disturbed us was the note written in blood on the wall. Life is Beta is dead. Join the New World.

We all moved into the headquarters after that. We were all provided transportation. I cannot give out the location, but if you decide to join you must download the app. It will show you one of two things. A screen that says, Its not Time or an animated version of yourself floating in the middle of your screen. If you get the Its not Time screen dont worry. You will be chosen in due time, but if you get the other screen choose kill. Once you choose kill, you will receive a phone call. Answer it and confirm your location with us. We will send someone out to get you to our headquarters. 

If you choose be killed you will set a target on yourself from our enemies without any sort of support from us. 

We dont have much time left. As I type this out in our headquarters, I have received the alert that 5 carriers and 2 more tellers were found in the eating hall, dead. They had the app New Eyes downloaded. All seven of them were found with knives shoved deep into their stomach and their eyes gouged out. I wish it just stopped there, but my phone has started to buzz nonstop. When I turned on my phone I noticed that nothing was different. While I started to put my phone away I received a text from Grant. I tapped on the message and my phone buzzed before jumping to a screen with me standing in the middle of a field. It was the field I went with my parents all the time. My parents came into the screen and walked up to me. As they got closer to me both of them started to chant, Life is Beta is dead, and so are you. End your life. Be free like us. I saw a shadow out of the corner of my eye.  

It took everything out of me to tear my eyes away, but as soon as I looked towards the shadow it was gone and I was standing alone in my room. I shut the phone off as quickly as I could, but the voices of my parents kept running through my head, and I kept seeing the shadow crawling beside me. I tried talking to Grant about it, but he was holding the shattered remains of his phone. Blood was trickling down from his hands. I tried talking to him again, but he cut me off and blurted out, Give me a fucking second. I need to find this blur. Its following me. I see him. Its because of this fucking app. Right when I opened the text that you sent I saw shit I never wanted to see. I tried talking to him, but he was silent after that.  

This is why we need more members. I know that it comes with risks, but this is to save potentially millions of lives. A lot of us will die, but they need to be stopped. People are dying in our organization as well as everywhere else. We are too weak to stop these invisible killers. We dont know where they came from or how they operate. All we know is that every single second the apps either kill or take over more lives. 

[Click this sentence to join our world] (https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/7838945bf88147bd9a945878783855a9/app_versions/2). We have only made the Android version of the app. If you have an Apple device I am sorry. We just don't have the space for you in our headquarters as of right now. 

You must allow third party app downloads to download the apk. If you cant figure out how to download it we do not want [you to join us] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yesterday started like any other day. I woke up, took a shower, and got dressed before telling my wife goodbye and headed off to work. 

My wife always thought I worked as a financial consultant. Frankly, I dont think she ever really cared what I did, but that worked out even better for me. You see, I have a unique job. I am a contract killer, but I only deal with suicidal people finish the job. Of course, I make them send me a copy of their id and three photos holding up specific items to prove they are who they are. The job came with two main perks.

1) Job security: I never ran out of clientele. Word spreads. They never knew who I was, but I made it an easy process for the people that needed my services. 

2) A semi-clear conscience: Killing anyone is a terrible thing. Suicide is never the answer, but in my opinion, if someone goes through that much work to kill themselves they are going to find another way anyways. Plus, they have the option of picking when and where their death will take place. I always make sure they have a quick and painless death. 
I had one man to take care of today. His name was Matthew Johnson. His wife left him and took their kids with her. His business was failing. He was down to his last 20k. Matthew couldnt even pay all of his employees by the end of this month. Thats why he contacted me. I charged him the regular rate of 15k. Once I received the payment from him I gave him the call to alert him that he only had 10 minutes to live. I was sitting on a hill about 300 yards away from the entrance to his company. 

Nine minutes later, he walked out. I looked through my scope and aimed at the middle of his head. My phone vibrated, but I ignored it and started to steady my breath. I took a deep breath and squeezed the trigger right as I started to exhale. Matthews body became limp. The back of his head sprayed blood all over the entrance door and he fell over. I took apart my sniper and put it back in my briefcase before running into the woods. I ran the three-mile distance to get to the other side of the woods and towards the shopping mall I parked at. When I got to my car I put my briefcase in my trunk and grabbed the spare t-shirt from the back seat of my car. I quickly changed into the fresh shirt before walking into the mall.

It was about 45 minutes past 12 so I walked into the mall and walked to the food court to pick up some lunch. When I got my medium pizza and large coke I took my seat and checked my business phone. 

It was from a number I recognized the minute I saw it.

It was my wifes phone number.

I opened the message and read the message before dropping the phone on the table. She needed my services. I wanted to text back, but I didnt know how to respond back to

*Hello. My name is Amber Jefferson. I need your help. I dont have anything to live for anymore. My husband has been getting more and more distant with me. My friends have stopped talking to me. Both of my parents are dead. I was fired from my job, and I do not have any reason to keep living.*

After thinking while I finished my pizza I decided to text her back. I asked, Can you send me a photo of your id? Three minutes later, I received a photo of her id from her number. 

After I checked the id I sent her another text asking, Can you send me 3 separate photos. The first one of you holding a can of Mello Yello, the next photo of you holding a bag of sour cream and onion flavored sunflower seeds and the last photo of you and your husband.   

I received two photos from you within 7 minutes. After I received the photo of her holding a can of Mello Yello and a bag of Sour Cream and Onion Sunflower seeds she sent me a message saying that she would be able to send me the last photo tonight. 

I came home at 8 pm that night. When I got home, I grabbed a beer from the fridge and sighed before I put up the can of Mello Yello and bag of sunflower seeds. I walked up to my room and got comfortable in the bed. I turned on the tv and started to relax when I received a picture. It was a photo of my wife lying next to me in bed. There is the last photo messaged right after the photo. I kept the phone pressed towards my stomach in case she managed to see. 

After I saw the photo I turned off both of my phones and fell asleep.

This morning, I woke up and knew that today was going to be rough. I turned on my business phone and instantly received a text from my wife. 

*I will be standing in front of the address written on my id. You know how to get rid of me. Do it at precisely 12:04 pm.*

I checked the time and jumped out of bed when I realized it was 11:58 am. 

I sent her a text that said, Okay. Free of charge.

When I ran out to the living room I greeted my wife the same way I did for the past 2 years. I kissed the only photo I had of her. The photo I took of her the day before she shot herself on our front lawn.

With a sigh, I took the photo off of my wall and gave it a final kiss before taking the photo out of the frame and ripping it up. After I tore it up i  threw it into my fireplace and watched it become smoke. 

While I wiped away a couple of tears from my eyes I received another text from my wife. I opened up the text. It simply said two words. 


Two final words.

<TITLE> My Uncle Has Been Acting Strangely After His Retirement </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-22 15:26:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I lived with my uncle ever since my mother and father passed away when I was in 7th grade. Though I missed my parents greatly, I quickly grew comfortable living with my uncle. I knew him since I was young, but he lived around 3 hours away so I only saw him about 6 times before I had to move in with him. The first two weeks was a bit awkward, but after a couple of trips to the gym to play basketball and several movies at the movie theater I started to get close to my uncle. 

He was there for every big moment in my life. He sat in the front row during my first basketball game, he dropped me off at prom, and he wiped away several tears on my graduation day. My uncle tried to convince me to go to college, but I told him over and over again that I dont need the extra education. There were plenty of jobs around our city that paid well without requiring a college degree. 

Six months later, I finally got a job as a sales associate at a nearby electronics store. When I told my uncle the good news he just grinned and said, You work there for a year. Just one year and let me know how you feel about the job. With a grin of my own, I said back, I mean. Ill probably like it better than working as a custodian! He let out a laugh and patted me on my shoulder before walking in the kitchen. I could hardly sleep that night. This was going to be my first job and I was a complete nervous wreck. 

Two days ago, my uncle retired from his job. He let me know the news when I came home, after just finishing my 4th month at my job, around 9 pm. As soon as he told me he retired I congratulated him and asked him what he planned on doing. He replied with a sullen look on his face, Live I guess. Not much else for me to do. Ill catch up on movies I wanted to watch. Ill try to stay out of your way. Im sure you have other things to worry about. Right as I tried to tell him that he was never in the way he got up and walked up the stairs to his bedroom.

After I cleaned all of the dishes I went into my room and sat on my bed while browsing through Reddit before my exhaustion took over me and I fell asleep. 

I woke up in the middle of the night at around 3 am. I heard a low humming coming outside of my room. I tried closing my eyes and ignoring the noise, but after waiting for 30 minutes for the noise to stop I got out of my bed and opened my door a little to peek out. My uncle was sitting in front of my room rocking his body to the left and to the right. Right as I cleared my throat he looked up at me and jumped to his feet before running downstairs to the kitchen. I ran after him and when I got to the kitchen he was nowhere to be found. I ran back upstairs to his room and looked through his slightly opened door. He wasnt there. I looked in the restroom, but he was not there. 

I ran back to his room and looked through the crack in his door again and almost screamed out loud when I saw my uncle sitting on the edge of his bed staring directly at me. I quietly took a step back and turned around to walk towards my room when I hear him start to whisper. It was faint and I couldnt really hear what he was saying so I called out to him, What are you saying? I cant hear you. His eyes locked onto mine before continuing in to whisper. Slightly panicking, I opened the door and walked up to him before screaming, Its better if you get rid of me. Get rid of me. Its better if you get rid of me. Just get rid of me!

I got to my feet and told him to get some sleep before running out of his room and into mine. I couldnt sleep that night. Every time I started to drift off I could hear my uncle walking past my door while constantly muttering, Get rid of me.

When I woke up last night I felt a strange calmness in the house. I walked out of my room and check on my uncle. He was asleep in his room. With a small smile, I got ready and headed off to work. The whole day thoughts of my uncle kept disturbing my thoughts. Was he going crazy? How did he keep disappearing? Why did he want me to get rid of him?

I ran out of the doors when my shift ended and drove to my house within 10 minutes. When I walked in I saw my uncle sitting on the couch staring at the powered off tv. I greeted him and walked into the kitchen and heated up a couple of Hotpockets. Right as I put the first Hotpocket on the plate I heard my uncle laughing. 


I walked out to check up on him and saw that he was staring at the tv and laughing at the blank screen. I asked him what he was laughing at, but he suddenly grew quiet and got up from the couch before walking upstairs into his room. 

I wanted to talk to him, but I knew it would just cause more problems. I ate my dinner in silence and walked up to my room. I opened the door to my room and saw my uncle standing in front of my window. I walked up to him and looked out the window. A couple of seconds later, he asked me, You know I miss my sister and your father very much. They meant a lot to me, but you meant so much more. I always wanted a son and you have made the dream a reality. For that, I am forever grateful. Thats why it breaks my heart when you wont just let me go. The house is yours. My money I saved is yours. You just. You just have to let me go. Can you do that for yourself? Hell, can you do that for me?

I turned to look at me and saw bits and pieces of his skin and flesh falling away from his body. After a bit, his exposed flesh and skin started to become a charcoal black. Smoke started to come off of his body. 

I fell to my knees and grabbed his legs. He tried to push off of me, but, I held tight. I dont want to ever believe hes dead. I want to keep thinking hes alive. I want to forget about the business he worked at catching on fire and taking the life of my uncle along with the building. I don't want to think he's gone. I really don't. In my head, he's still alive, and as long as he's still alive in my head his soul is trapped with me. 

I know my uncle wants peace, but I dont want to accept his death. I know once I accept his death. Its all over. Hes gone, and I can never [see him again] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TEXT> My memory of what I once was is slowly fading away, but before I forget about the person I once was I decided to post my story here for the hope that I will one day come across it. 

Who am I now? I am a 29-year-old white male. My name is Ryan Freeman, and I love to listen to music while I cook exquisite meals. Im skilled in a lot of things, but my main passion is cooking. My goal is to be a chef full time at any well-known Italian restaurant. 

Who was I before? A fucking good for nothing unemployed 48-year-old male that never tried to make anything out of my life. The only reason why I wasnt out on the streets was because my father left me the house and every single cent he saved up when he passed away 2 years ago. 

I started to run out of money last month so I started going around the city putting in job applications and went to three job interviews, but I never got a call back after any of the interviews. 

Yesterday morning I woke up to the sound of my phone going off. When I checked the caller I couldnt help but smile. It was Jeff, my best friend, as soon as I said; Hello he told me that he got me a job at the company he worked for as a custodian. I know it may not be a glamorous job, but I was desperate so I asked him what I would have to do. With a chuckle, Jeff told me to just come in clean clothes and the job was mine. 

As soon as I hung up the phone I ran to my room to find a decently clean outfit, but after digging all around the floor of my room I could not find a clean shirt of pants. 

Plan B.

I grabbed the nicest looking dress shirt and khaki pants and ran to my car, I knew of a couple of laundry mats around my house so I drove towards the closest one about 2 miles away. 

Right as I started to drive past the entrance to my neighborhood I saw the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my life walk past my rear view mirror. I looked to my right to see which house she came out of but all I saw was a single building sitting at the end of an empty street. 

Curious, I backed up and drove into the street. As I drove up to the building I passed by 7 people that looked like they belonged in movies. They all walked with confidence and seemed like they did not have an ounce of stress weighing them down. There were a couple of people walking towards the building, but they walked and looked similar to me. Defeated and broken down, but they still walked with a hop in their step. Kind of like, they were excited for what was to come. 

I was a bit disappointed when I parked my car and looked inside. 

It was just a laundry mat called Clean and Repeat. 

With a sigh, I got out of my car and grabbed my clothes and walked into the door. The smell of rotten copper hit my nose and I couldnt help but let out a loud gag. A guy walked up to me and asked, You new here? I nodded yes to him and he chuckled before saying, Well nice to meet you, man. I go by Bud. Ive been working here for over 12 years. Im guessing youre wondering about what we do here. We show up to people that need us the most. Anyone on earth can get to us, but only a few can find us. Youre one of the few! Congratulations! What we offer is a chance to start over. 

I looked around and noticed that there were only washers. Another thing I noticed was that most of the people that walked in here did not come in with any type of laundry. While I was looking around my eyes landed on a man crying in front of one of the machines. He called out, Im so sorry Gerald. You deserve a better daddy. I hope you can understand why I had to do this. With a final sob, he hopped inside of the washing machine. The door to the machine closed and I ran up to the man to get him out, but when I got up to him I saw his body slowly fall apart in the water. Soon, the water was filled with chunks of flesh, strips of skin, and torn up organs. 

Two minutes later, the water stopped and the door flew open. A guy in a red shirt walked up to the washer and dragged a lump of foam out of the washer. A scream of pure agony came from inside of the foam. I covered my ears and looked around, but everyone walked around as if nothing was out of the ordinary. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw an arm and a leg poke out of the foam. When I turned to get a better look I saw a naked man brushing the bits of soap residue off of him.

He looked completely different; he was younger, much better looking, and had a face full of ambition and dreams. Bud walked up to the guy and talked to him. The guy nodded at Bud and took the clothes Bud handed to him. He walked out the door with a huge grin on his face and a sense of pride in every step he took. 

When the guy walked out the door Bud walked up to me and asked, I know you hate your life. You are about to take a dead end job. Dont do that. Just get into one of these cleansers and you will walk out a new man. Everything you have done that was wrong will be wiped away from you. You will walk out a new man. A man that is full of purpose and most importantly a man that has a goal to strive for.

Without hesitation, I opened the door and hopped into one of the cleansers. With a grin, Bud closed the door and mouthed the words, No regrets. Scalding hot water started to pour all over me, but the pain was so intense I could hardly make a sound. By the time I could muster a decent scream I felt myself becoming part of something else. 

Something pure, but something that didnt feel right. 

I dont really know how to describe how it felt to be completely torn apart, but Ill try my best. Every regret and every bad or horrible thing I did in my life swam past my thoughts. 

The thoughts floating around the water in between pieces of my body. 

Judgment day.

Thats a good phrase to use to describe how it was like. I still felt the intense heat that filled every part of my body, and the memories of every single sin corrupted me mentally and physically. The time I made fun of my cousin for dressing like a girl, the time I beat up my awkward best friend to gain the approval of the more popular kids in my class, and the memory of sitting on the couch after my father fell down the stairs. He crawled around the floor like a helpless mutt for 20 minutes before taking his last breath just two years ago.  

The unbearable stopped as soon as the last memory faded away. I heard the door open and felt two hands grab me and pull me out of the machine. With each second the pain came back while my body started to piece back together. When I finally felt whole again, I let out a scream to express every bit of pain my body just went through before ripping past the foam and standing up in my new body for the first time. 

Bud walked up to me and handed me some clothes before leaning up to me and whispering, Enjoy your new life, but when we need you. You will need to forget everything and give your life to us. After all, you owe us for giving you a life you dont deserve. Give me a nod that you understand. 

Once I put on the clothes he handed me I turned to him and shook my head no before running out of the building and got into my car. I took one final look inside of the building. Bud was shaking his head while laughing and pointed at me. Scared out of my mind, I drove out of the street and stopped to take a final look at the building.

There was nothing there. 

It was just woods. 

When I got to my house I ran into my room and never left. I am still in my room now. Its been over a day, but my memories keep fading away. The only thing I remember now is what happened yesterday. 

Before I forget about my life I wanted to warn all of you guys. Please dont go into any secluded Laundromats. It may seem like a good thing, but I no longer own my life. Be thankful with what you [have now] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Being a single 38-year-old father of a 13-year-old is quite the challenge, but my son, Jared, has made it far too easy for me. He was the poster child of a good child. He never got into trouble, excelled at every subject in school, and had a passion for the classical guitar. Of course, just like any other kid, he would do something wrong, but he was always honest with me. He would tell me what he did, and he would always seem legitimately sorry for his actions. 

That is why I was browsing through craigslist looking for an Xbox One. I knew he wanted one, but it was far too expensive for me to buy. I could barely keep up with the bills, but I checked for a decent deal every night before I went to bed.

Four days ago, I came across a new ad placed for an Xbox One with 4 games for just $75. When I clicked on the ad I saw that an enraged mother was selling her sons game system because he failed in all of his classes. After checking the time and seeing that it was 8:30 pm I called the number that was on the bottom of the post. 

10 minutes later, we agreed to meet at my house at 10 am the next day to make the transaction. Before she hung up the phone she said, I just want you to know something. My son. He is a smart kid. He is a really good boy, but ever since he got that stupid system he started getting obsessed over a game. I dont really know which one, but just monitor your son. I hung up the phone with an uneasy feeling, but I knew that my son was different. He deserved it.  

When my son came home from school he screamed out in joy when he saw me hooking up his new Xbox up to the tv. He ran up and gave me a hug and sat right next to me while I connected the HDMI cable to the system. I handed the controller to Jared and he started looking through the games. Once he picked out some sort of car racing game I got up and started getting dinner ready. By the time I put together the last chicken taco I turned around to call out to Jared to come in, but I saw he was already sitting on his chair. The whole entire meal Jared thanked me for getting him the Xbox and about how his first couple races went. When we finished dinner he got up and walked into his room. 

After I cleared out the dishes and washed them, I walked upstairs to my room and when I passed by his room I checked in his room and saw that he was closing up his school notebook and picking up his guitar. I had to get up early for a meeting the next morning so I fell asleep as soon as I walked into the room to the sound of my son strumming out Fur Elise. 

The next couple of days went by smoothly. My son would come home, play on the Xbox for about 1 to 2 hours, eat dinner with me, and then do his homework and practice his guitar before going to bed. 

Two days ago, everything changed. My son looked through his games, but after a couple of seconds he started going through the menu on the Xbox. I told myself to make sure I had some new games before next week. 

I made chicken soup that night, but when I was done making it my son was not sitting in front of the dinner table like he always was. After I called out to him 3 times without a response I walked out of the kitchen and into the living room. 

He was completely fixated on a game I havent seen him play before. 

It was just a yellow ball on the far right corner of the screen. There were smaller gray balls flying towards the yellow ball that I guess you tried to avoid. I tapped on Jareds shoulder, but he ignored me and kept playing the game. 

He never did this before so I just took his dinner out to the living room and placed it next to him. I told him to eat it whenever he felt like it. 

I never really worried about him. He always did the right thing. The next day was Saturday too, so I decided to let him play the game for as long as he wanted. After I finished my dinner I gave Jared a kiss on the forehead and walked to my room. I was used to falling asleep to the sound of his music, but the fast paced rhythmic tapping on his controller slowly guided me to sleep. 

I woke up at 5 am yesterday morning. The first thing I noticed was that I could still hear the sound of tapping. The second thing I noticed was that the tapping was completely in rhythm. Not a single tap was out of the beat that filled the otherwise silent house. I got out of bed and walked downstairs.

Jared was still sitting in front of the tv. I tapped on him several times, but he did not take his eyes off of the screen. I looked him in the eyes to get his attention, but the glazed look in his eyes made me start to panic. His eyes were a solid green. It wasnt the lighting or anything on the screen. His eyes were solid green. Without any hesitation, I grabbed the controller out of his hands and started to drag him to his room. He screamed and tried to get out of my grip, but I didnt loosen my grip until he was in his room. 

Through his tears and his screaming, he crawled to his bed and fell asleep. 

Curious, I went downstairs and picked up the controller. It was on the start menu so I just clicked on the option that said, Start New Game. 

I played it one time.

Just once, but it is taking all of my willpower to not play it again. I know its not good. Its called Desires Unknown. If you happen to come across the game please do not play it. 

It has taken up almost all of my thoughts. 

What does the game do?

When you start the game you are the dot on the far right side. Not just a pixelated version of you. No. A real life version of you. 

The gray dots that fly towards you?

Everything that you ever wanted.

The first couple of dots were my favorite foods. Lasagna, steak, roast beef, and spaghetti, but as the dots progressed, it soon became my son graduating from an Ivy League college, my wife surviving past the first 3 hours of Jareds birth and the promotion that would allow me to spend more time with Jared without having to worry about finances. It took me everything to avoid all of the temptations, but Im afraid to play again.

Im afraid to figure out what happens if you fall for any of the [temptations] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My best friend (Zane) and I decided to go to the same college for our first two years. We were both against the idea of living in dorms so we used the money we saved up during high school to pay for six months of rent up front. We both got jobs within the first month of college. Between work and college, we hardly had time to hang out, but we quickly made it a tradition to eat Flamin Hot Cheetos and split a 24 pack of beer every Sunday evening while watching whatever was on tv.
 
The first four months went by in a blur. I managed to make a couple of friends get promoted to shift manager and make straight As on all of my classes. Zane on the hand lost his job, became more and quieter, and was barely scraping by with passing grades. I tried to cheer him up multiple times a day, but he would just either grunt in response or just ignore me completely.
 
Four days ago, Zane left and never came back. I didnt panic for the first day, but 2 days after not seeing Zane I started to get worried. I tried calling him several times, but he didnt answer. He wouldnt respond to any of my messages on Facebook or text. I went to bed with an uneasy feeling that night. The next morning when I woke up I broke down and ended up calling the cops.
 
They came over and got a couple of notes from me. I showed them a couple of photos from his Facebook and Instagram. Around 30 minutes later they told me they would try their hardest to find him and left. I tried going about the day, but during my classes, I couldnt really pay attention to what the professor was talking about. After my last class, I walked back home and changed into my work uniform and walked to the bookstore. The five-hour shift felt like it was never going to end. I started counting down the minutes during the final two hours. My counting was disturbed when I overheard a couple of girls talk about a man that was found dead outside of our school cafeteria. Curious, I walked up to them and asked them if there was any type of description of the man. After a couple of seconds of awkward silence, the girl holding a phone handed me the phone and pointed at the article. 

One look and I let out a breath of relief. The man in the photo had white hair. There wasn't really a description of how he was killed or who to look out for. Of course, I was scared that there was a murderer in our college campus, but I was relieved that Zane wasn't dead. I handed back the phone while thanking the girls and walked to the back to try calling him again. After my third unsuccessful attempt I walked out and walked around the store and acted like I was working for the remainder of the shift. 

When I got home I sat on the couch and waited there till around 4 in the morning. I knew he wasn't coming home, but I didn't want to give up hope. He was the guy that beat up my bully for me when we were in the 5th grade. The one that warned me about how my homecoming date was gonna ditch me once we got to homecoming. The one that motivated me to shoot for a full scholarship for whatever college I decided to go. The one that gave me the smile that I loved seeing when I told him that I got accepted with a full scholarship for the college he was going to as well.
When I woke up yesterday morning I got ready and walked to my first class. When I got to the class I saw a note from the professor posted in front of the door saying that classes were canceled for today. I checked my e-mails to make sure another student was pulling a prank on me, but the first e-mail I saw was an alert from the college office.

**Subject: Stay indoors. Do not leave.**

*We are sending out a warning for all of our student to not leave their rooms or their houses. Yesterday evening we have lost 8 students.*

*If you decide to leave be reminded that this is on your own terms. We suggest going out in groups. We are looking into the deaths of the students, but we are temporarily canceling all classes until we resolve this issue.*

I ran back to my house as fast as I could. When I walked inside of the house I swear I could smell the smell of the cologne Zane used since high school. I walked into the living room to see a familiar sight for the first time.

A 24 pack of beer and two bags of Flamin' hot Cheetos. 

On the news later that day they were covering the deaths on our campus. I instantly noticed two names. The bully Zane beat up, and the girl that planned on ditching me for the homecoming dance.

Zane, if you're reading this. I don't agree with this, but man, I sure do appreciate how much you really care about me. Be safe. This beer is in [honor of you] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel).

<TEXT> Hello my name is Malik, and smoking cigarettes ruined my life in a unique way. Until I started college I was always a straight edge kid. Not by choice, but because my mother and father kept me insanely sheltered. It was to the point to where I would have to give them a 3 week notice to go hand out with any of my friends. Every Sunday and Wednesday I went to church, and Every Tuesday and Thursday I would have Bible study with my father. I was forced to memorize 20 verses a week to earn the privilege of 30 minutes of tv a day and an hour of computer time a week. Both activities were under my mothers supervision. 

I loved my parents, but I always wondered what it would be like to have the freedom to make my own choices. That is why the day my parents dropped me off at my college was the best day of my life. It was 3 hours away from home, and since I received a full ride scholarship for college I was not bound by my parents any longer. 

The first three months went by in a blur. I still called my mother at the end of my classes for around 20 to 30 minutes to assure her that I was still studying the Bible every night. My roommate, Tyler, would sometimes sit on his bed and laugh at my obvious lies. 

After my daily phone call I would finish my homework while texting a girl I started talking to the first month into college. We met at a party and just clicked. It was the first night I drank my first beer. It tasted like shit, but after finishing my 3rd beer I got used to the taste. We danced together for a couple of songs before she walked outside while waving at me to follow her. For the next 3 hours, we sat around and talked about what we were planning on doing after college while she smoked cigarette after cigarette. She tried offering me one but I told her I didnt smoke. After we met that night we never stopped talking after that. Two months into our relationship she took my virginity and it was the best experience of my life. She was my first love, and I knew that I wanted to marry her.

One month ago she broke up with me. When I tried asking her why, she just shook her head before saying, Malik, youre a sweet guy. You really made me feel special, but we were just not meant to be together. Youre too nice. You deserve someone much better. She touched my cheek one last time before exiting my dorm room for the last time. When Tyler walked in an hour later he asked me if I was okay. I nodded my head yes and asked him if he had a cigarette on him. With a confused look on his face, he took out his pack of Marlboro Reds and motioned me to follow him. I smoked my first cigarette that day in front of the entrance to our dorm building. The first three hits of the cigarette sent me into a coughing frenzy, but by the time I finished the cigarette I felt a million times better. I was still hurt by the abrupt break up, but I was actually able to rationalize with myself that everything would be better after a couple of weeks.

I was hooked. Not hooked in the sense of being addicted, but addicted to the feeling of being at complete peace.

The next day I bought my first pack of cigarettes with Tyler. When I walked outside I ripped open the pack and tossed a cigarette in my mouth, but he snatched it out of my mouth and shoved it back into my pack upside down. When he saw my confused face, he laughed and said, Whenever you buy a pack of smokes you flip one upside down and smoke it last. Its just a superstitious thing, but we call it the lucky cigarette and I swear something good happens to me after I smoke it. 

***

You can call me crazy, but Tyler was right. Every time I smoked my lucky cigarette something really good would happen to me. It took me 3 days to finish my first pack. After I smoked my last cigarette, I got a call from my mother telling me that they sent me $300 dollars to do whatever I wanted with my friends. She apologized for being so strict my whole childhood. After an hour of talking, she told me to start enjoying life before hanging up the phone. 

The next pack took me two day to finish. When I smoked the lucky cigarette, I got a message from my ex-girlfriend asking to get back together, but I got the satisfaction of being the one to reject her. Over the next couple of weeks my life started getting better with each lucky cigarette I smoked, but it all changed two days ago. 

***

Two days ago, I woke up and smoke a cigarette while I ran to my first class, but halfway through my cigarette I accidentally ran right into a guy. He started to yell at me, but I ignored him and got to my class on time. After the class I smoked my next cigarette and as I finished it I saw my ex running across the street. About halfway across the street I saw a car come out of nowhere and slam against her body. She launched into the air and bounced three times on the unforgiving gravel. 

I knew she was dead. I didnt run up to her body like everybody else around me. I walked to my dorm building and ran up to my room. 

I smoke cigarette after cigarette in the room. I didnt care anymore. Before I fell asleep that night the smell of cigarettes filled the room. It was almost impossible to breathe in the room, but I lit up another one and took a drag. Tyler walked into the room and tried to tell me to take it outside, but after a couple of minutes of ignoring him he walked out of the room.  

I woke up yesterday morning to knocking on my door. When I opened my door, I saw two cops standing outside. They asked me if I could answer a couple of questions. It was a mixture of what Tyler was like and if he ever seemed depressed. Near the end of their questions I learned that Tyler tried to hang himself in the study room of our dorm building. He was still alive and had a good chance of survival. 

I skipped my classes that day to go visit him in the hospital. When I walked into his room he looked up at me and gave me a small wave. When I got close I asked him, Man why did you do it? You always seemed so happy. Was it something I did? He grabbed my hand and said, I really dont know why. It wasnt you or anyone else. After I walked out of our room I just felt more sadness than I ever felt in my life. It seemed like the only way out. I tried to think of something to say, but I couldnt think of anything. I walked out and smoked a lucky cigarette and another cigarette from my next pack. When I walked back into the hospital I saw a couple of people running towards Tylers room. I ran with them into his room. The heart beat monitor filled with a straight horizontal line. His body was completely still. I wanted to run up to his bed, but my feet wouldnt move. After a couple of second of staring at his dead body, I turned around and ran back outside and drove back to my dorm building. 

I have been here since yesterday. 

I am now writing to you all. It may be a small chance that this will happen to you, but please dont flip your cigarette over to make it a lucky cigarette. For some of you it may just be something that never affects you, but for people like me. It will ruin your life. The lucky cigarettes remain lucky, but every other cigarette will make your life that much worse.

I tried to just not smoke, but after an hour something bad happens anyways. So, I just kept smoking cigarettes yesterday. My father died of a heart attack last night, my mother was in the hospital after having a stroke, and now it has become harder for me to breather.

So that is why I have Tylers gun in my hand. The gun he hid in his desk in case shit went down. 

With the final drag of my final lucky cigarette I am hitting submit on this warning for you all, and accepting my final bit of luck.

[Death] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> Security Cameras Proved My Wife Isn't Cheating on Me </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My wife and I have been married for twenty years. We got married three weeks after we graduated college. We had our ups and our downs, but at the end of the night I always felt just that much closer to her than the night before. My feelings for her never died away, but after we moved into the new house 3 months ago my wife has started growing more and more distant from me. It started with her ignoring a couple things I said, to blowing off on our monthly date. Now she will barely talk to me. 

Of course, I had my suspicions. Who wouldnt? That is why when my wife out on her daily walk yesterday, I texted my wife that I was going shopping and I would be back soon. I quickly got in my car and drove to the local electronics store. When a sales representative greeted me I told him that I would need a couple of hidden cameras. He gave me a nod and led me to the middle of the sales floor. With a wave of his arm he started to pitch me on the most expensive set. When he saw the look of concern on my face he gave me a smile and asked, So what is you budget? Trying to hide the embarrassment in my voice I managed to mutter out, 300 dollars. 

After a couple of seconds, he stuck out his hand and said, My name is Jack by the way. I took his hand and said, Glenn. With a look of concern, he asked, So I know it may be personal, but why are you getting the cameras? 

Im normally a really reserved man. I have never been one to open up to anyone, but something about his voice. The soft yet stern words that left the mans mouth made me fall on my knees and start sobbing. With a gentle nudge Jack said, Cmon to the back man. Lets talk. I want to help you. I got up to my feet and quietly followed him to the door in the back while avoiding all of the weird stares from other customers. 

Once we walked through the doors I saw a small room with a table and two chairs. Jack pulled out a chair and I sat in it while he took the other seat. Before he could ask me again I rambled on for what felt like hours about what my wife used to be like and how she was now. As I got close to the end of my story I felt another surge of tears, but Jack gently touched my shoulder and I felt all of my grief fade away. 

I looked up at him and for the first time in 3 months I smiled. He told me to wait up front and he would bring me what I was looking for. After waiting ten minutes at the front counter Jack walked through the doors with a small white box in his hands. While he walked up to the counter he started opening up the box and as walked up to me he put the box in my hands and told me to look inside. Inside of the box were three small monkey glass figurines and a small device with a screen. 

I started to ask, What am I sup-, but Jack cut me off and said, These three little guys run off of solar power and will never need to be charged. This guy is the monitor you can watch what any of the cameras see. The monitor you will have to charge once every two to three days depending on usage. He leaned close to me and whispered, Its normally 1400 for the set, but Ill let you have it for 300. Just dont say a word while I ring you up. 

When he rung up the camera set I handed him 300 dollars and he reached into his wallet and swiped it into the card reader. With a nod he said, Okay sir just sign the pad and youre ready to go! I signed the pad with my finger and he put the box and the receipt in the bag and handed it over to me. I mouthed out Thank you and hurried into my car. Slightly curious, I opened the box and turned the screen on. For the first couple of second the screen remained black, but after a couple of second of waiting the screen turned yellow and four blue lines shot out of each corner and met in the middle to form two words.

**Reveal Everything**

***

I picked up one of the little figurines and started looking around for the camera. When I couldnt find any I looked back at the screen and Camera 1 and Camera 3 were black while Camera 2 showed my face staring dumbly at myself in the screen. Satisfied, I drove back home and placed a camera in the living room, the kitchen, and our bedroom. 

My wife walked in from her walk around 7 pm and started to walk upstairs. I asked her if she wanted to eat dinner, but she just ignored me and continued to walk upstairs and into the room. 

When I woke up this morning I got out of bed, got dressed, and rushed out of the house without saying a word to my wife. 

Twenty minutes later, I got to work about an hour early. I grabbed the monitor and walked into the office and sat down on my chair. I checked the cameras but saw that my wife was still asleep. 

***

Three hours go by without an alert. I still checked on the monitor but my wife was still asleep the whole entire time. Around lunch time was when I got my first motion alert. I quickly turned the screen back on and saw my wife slowly getting out of bed and walking downstairs. My eyes bounced to the camera pointing at the living room towards the front door, but my wife just sat on the couch for about 30 minutes. 

That is when I saw it. Tiny black spots started to show up all around the living room. At that moment my wife started to curl into a ball on the couch. I thought it was the camera or the screen so I tried slapping the back of the monitor, but every couple of seconds the dots started grouping together. Each time the black dots grouped together I noticed my wife tensing up even more. I tried calling my wife several times, but she only looked at the phone before putting it on the table and stared towards the dots grouping together. 

I turned the screen off and wrote an email to my boss that I had an emergency and I would have to leave before running to my car. When I got inside my car I turned the monitor back on and saw my wife walking all around the house, but there was a shadow following behind her. When she opened the door to our room the shadow disappeared. I started driving home while still glancing at the screen to make sure my wife was still okay. I drove into the entrance to our neighborhood and parked in my driveway before checking the screen for the last time. The tablet dropped out of my hands as soon as I saw what was on the screen. A man with a deep red gash in his neck was bent over the body of my wifes body. Blood was around my wife.

I ran into our house and ran upstairs to our room. 

My wife is dead. Her midsection was completely extinct by the time I ran into the room. I looked around the house, but I knew that we were the only ones in the house that can be seen.

I gave the cops the monitor for investigative purpose. After being interviewed for 4 hours I was finally able to find a hotel spend the next couple of nights in. My wife is gone. My life is ruined. I took one of the cameras with me when I walked out of my house. When I smashed it against the wall out of frustration I only saw broken glass. 

Nothing else.

Just glass.

So please guys.

Please help me.

I dont [know what to do] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> Life is Luck </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-13 00:55:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My name is Bowie and I dont know what to do now. Im trapped in a game that I cannot escape. Before I get started I want you guys to put yourself in my shoes. Ignore all of the dumb shit I did. Ignore the fact that I decided to quit the game as soon as I lost my right ring finger. Just try your very hardest to understand why I am now at the predicament I am in now. 

It started two days ago. Two close friends of mine, Angelo and Sen, and I were on vacation in Seoul, South Korea. We had about 3 hours to kill before our favorite night club opened so we were all messing around with our phones. Out of the blue, Sen looked up and grinned while saying, So, you guys want to relive our childhood with a board game? It actually kinda reminds me of [life] (http://web-vassets.ea.com/Assets/Richmedia/Image/Screenshots/game-of-life-playbook-screen02_656x369.jpg?cb=1412974586), but you have to deposit 50 bucks to get started and you can either make more or lose it all. So a gambling version of Life?

I told Sen it was probably a scam, but he tapped away on his phone without giving me a single response. With a sigh, I scrolled through r/funny. Ten minutes go by, and I notice that Sen was tapping on the screen with a huge grin on his face. I walked up behind him and glanced over his shoulder at the phone. On the screen, I saw a board game made up of 20 total tiles. He rolled tapped on a box and it scrolled quickly and stopped on the number 3. His character, a foot, moved up 3 spaces and landed on a tile with a question mark on it. A card came out and slowly flipped over to show $40 dollars written on the middle of it. 

I didnt really think much of it until his phone vibrated and a notification from his bank popped up alerting him of a recent 40 dollar deposit. Now filled with curiosity, I tapped on Sens shoulder and asked him where he found the game. He looked back at me and told me to look up A Life of Luck on Google and it would show me the page where I could download the APK of the game. Seven minutes later, I downloaded the game and made my deposit of 50 bucks using my paypal account. 

The payment screen closed down and a game board filled the screen. A metal hand floated around the middle of the screen and floated down to the tile that said Start Your Luck. I tapped on the same small box Sen did and numbers started to spin inside of the box. The first spin was a 4. It was a blank yellow tile, but when the hand landed on it $3 appeared and a text from my bank came for a deposit alert for $3. I should have forgotten about the game, but my mind was clouded by the potential money to even think about how the game somehow knew which bank account to send the money to. 

Over the next hour I made back the initial 50 dollars back 3 folds. To say that I was hooked was an understatement. Within the short time span, that game had become the best thing that ever happened in my life. Angelo tried to get us to go with him to the club two hours after that, but we were both far too into the game to even get up from the couch we were sitting on. Angelo started to tug on my arm, but I ripped my arm out of his grip and sat back down. Defeated, he sat down next to me and glanced at my phone. 

After a couple of rolls and $80 more dollars in my bank account Angelo sat in between us and quickly lost himself in the game. I wanted to quit and go to the club, but for some reason everything about the game drew me back. The cheesy background music, the bright colors on the board, and the potential money kept my eyes and hands glued to my phone. 

None of us slept that night. I dozed off a couple of times, but every time I fell asleep a slow voice would wake me back up and I would find myself tapping on the box once again. I finally fell asleep around 8 yesterday morning and woke up to the sound of Angelo screaming, What the fuck does that mean? I looked up from the couch and saw Angelo standing up and pointing his screen at me. It was one of the cards you got from the question mark tile and it said, Cut Sens finger off and you can keep playing. Dont cut it. You quit.

I tried to think up of something to say, but Angelo exited out of the app and deleted it before walking into the bathroom. 

This is where I want you to not judge me. I was obsessed along with Sen. You can say that you would have deleted it along with Angelo, but you just havent experienced something as addicting as the game. 

It took us four hours to realize that Angelo never came out of the restroom, and another 2 hours before I managed to get out of the couch to check up on him. When I walked in I saw Angelos head was turned towards me but the rest of his body was turned the other way. He stared at me with a blank stare and I felt my blood run cold. Sen walked up behind me and started to laugh. He showed me his screen when I turned around to look at him and he had a mystery card on his screen as well. 

Fuck the corpse in the bathroom.
 
I started to shake my head no at him, but he tried shoving past me. Once he got in, he slammed the bathroom door shut.

He dropped his phone while going into the restroom. 

I dont know why.

It was just a mixture of rage for the app, the situation I found myself in, Angelos death, and Sens willingness to fuck the corpse of our once good friend. I exited out of the game on his phone and deleted it. 

I walked back to the couch and fell asleep. Every time I woke up I forced my eyes closed and continued to sleep until this morning. When I checked my phone I saw a notification on my phone from A Life of Luck two hours ago.

Delete it you will die. Ignore a challenge you will die. Eat the hands of your friends and you will live. You have 5 hours.

Like I said before. Please ignore the judgment you want to give me. I know I fucked up. I know I screwed over Sen, but please help me. I dont know how they killed them, but when I walked back into the restroom Sen had his head turned the same way as Angelo, but their hands were lying on the ground in [front of them] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/messages/?threadid=100001640267603 timestamp=1489329738637).

<TITLE> An App Called "Time is Money" Gives you More than Just Money </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-11 15:22:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the past three days I have lost my best friend since I was seven and I am 30k richer. 

It all started when I was sitting on my bed in my dorm room. My best friend, Alex, ran into our room and excitedly said, Dude, take your phone out. I thought it was a joke, but man I just made 300 dollars in 10 minutes. Intrigued, I asked him, Wait. Slow down. What the fuck are you talking about? He grabbed my phone out of my hand and threw it back at me after a couple of taps. I picked my phone up and saw a treasure chest in the middle of my screen. **Tap Continue to Participate in the Greatest Money Scavenger Hunt of All Time.**

Before I could think about it Alex tapped the continue button and the screen bounced to my home screen. An app called Time is Money was placed in the middle of an otherwise blank screen. The icon was solid yellow with a small treasure box [in the middle] (https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/g1F4xCR4/IMG_8656.PNG).

I looked back up at Alex and he gave me a nod. Once I opened up the app it went to a solid blue screen with two options. 

*Scavenger* and *Quitter* were the two options with **Decisions are Irreversible** written underneath. I tapped on Scavenger and it took me to a white page with 8 nearby locations listed. One of them was the sandwich shot I was going to so I tapped on Gregs Sandwich and Homemade Soups. The app closed down and my navigation app came up. Alex and I rushed out and when we got close to the sandwich shop the navigation closed out and Time is Money opened back up and showed a picture of a red brick underneath a water hose. 

I walked to the side of the building where the hose was and saw a red brick. When I picked it up I saw 5 $100 bills underneath with a note that said, Well done. I dont know why I didnt think something was off, but this was the first time I had extra money. With a smile, I handed Alex a hundred, but he placed the money back into my hand and said, This is change for us. We will be rich soon man. I laughed and put the money in my pocket and walked into the sandwich shop for my first stress free lunch in a long time.

The next day we spent the whole day on the app and went to every single place the list showed us. Twelve hours of running/walking and a combined total of 9k later we ran into our room with exhausted breaths but a permanent smile on our faces. We split the cash evenly, but reached a mutual agreement that searching on our own would allow us to make even more money. 

Yesterday was beyond productive for me in the morning. I ran around the town like a madman and made a total of 21k bringing my total to 25.5k. At 2pm I tapped on the option for the campus library. When I got there a picture of the librarians desk filled my screen. With a mental nod of confirmation, I ran inside and saw that the librarian wasnt behind the desk. There was a small box in the second drawer of the shelf. When I opened I saw the biggest stack of money I had seen so far. I dug my hand into the box and grabbed the cash, but I felt something thin and hard on the bottom. 
 
Out of instinct, I jerked my hand out of the box to see that my hand was covered in thick red liquid. Swallowing back the vomit that started to come out, I took out the cash and shoved it into my pocket. In the bottom of the box there was a severed finger. Disgusted, I threw the box back in the drawer and rushed out. 

I know. I know I should have quit right then, but the thought of more money filled my mind and I kept going back to the app for my next location. It took me three more trips to realize I needed to quit. In the next three locations I have found a toe, another finger, and a heart hooked up to a car battery. It was still beating when I grabbed the money it was on top of. 

Last night Alex never came back into the room. 

I started to panic when it was 3 am and he hadnt come back yet. I grabbed my phone out of my pocket and saw that I had an unread text message. It was from an hour ago. 

It was from Alex and it said, Man I have been finding some weird shit. Not normal weird. Fucking fingers and other body parts I dont even know. I deleted the app and downloaded it again. This time I chose Quitter. You might want to do the same thing. This shit. Its not cool man.

I stayed up for another 2 hours waiting on Alex, but as exhaustion from the day hit me I fell asleep. 

I woke up at 10 am this morning. Despite the money I earned, I woke up scared and helpless. Alex wasnt in the room. I tried calling him seven times, but each time I called him it went straight to voicemail.

My phone vibrated three times and I picked it up and tapped the power button. 

There was a notification from Time is Money.

Alex Jameson Has Volunteered to be a Donator of the game. 

My fingers shaking and my forehead drenched in sweat, I tapped on the notification and a picture of my best friend was on the screen. The friend that beat up my first bully and the one that prepped me up for my first date was lying on the bottom of the picture. There was a hole where his chest once was. 

With tears rolling down my cheeks, I screamed out a mixture of pain, hurt, and absolute fear.

I dont know who to turn to. I went to the local police station and tried to show them the app, but it disappeared from my phone.

I made more money than I ever thought I would make during college, but I would give back every single cent and my life for Alex to breathe [just one last time] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> My Son is Seeing Things I Can't on His New Tablet </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-09 15:21:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Being a single father has always been hard for me, but it has been even harder for my son. My wife passed away when my son was 3. She was admitted into the hospital for pains in her midsection. Three days later, she passed away in her sleep. My son never received the attention he needed. Since he was three, I had to send him to my parents house while I worked and picked him up around 7. We would eat dinner and watch a couple of shows with him, but I would sometimes catch him looking at the empty seat next to him. Whenever he did that I would always feel my eyes start to tear up. It really felt like he knew that was where his mother used to sit. 

Until he turned 4, he would go into my room and open up a heart shaped jelly and place it on top of his sippy cup and place it on the desk my wife bought me for our [5th anniversary] (https://scontent-icn1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17155379_225604794579068_5697166437193041000_n.jpg?oh=a3104fade43fc870ea5871c1dcf1b4cf oe=59611B99). The last anniversary we spent together. 

When he stopped doing his nightly ritual he started to grow more and more distant with me.

It broke my heart, but I continued to work and spend less and less time with him. By the time he was five he started to scream and shout whenever I picked him up. My breaking point came when my father walked out of the house to wave goodbye to my son and he yelled, Take me back to daddy. I want daddy. Let me go. Let me go! With tears welling up in my eyes I got him into the car seat and took him home. 

I had money I saved up to start up my own restaurant, but I didnt want to lose my son. He was the remaining part of my wife I had left, and he meant more to me than my life did. The first week of keeping him home with me was rough. They were filled with my son constantly asking me when I would take him to mommy and daddy, but I told him that we were going to stay at home for a little while. He would scream and cry for almost for the remainder of the day until I fed him his dinner and put him to bed.

Three days ago we went to Wal-Mart together to pick up some groceries. While we were there I went into the electronics section to get a phone charger. My son was standing close to me the whole time, but when I finally picked out a charger I looked around and saw that he vanished. I started to run around the electronics section until I saw him standing in front of a tablet. When I walked up to him I saw that all of his attention was on the tablet. I looked at the price tag and without a second thought flagged a worker and told him I wanted to buy one. My son looked at me, and for the first time, he was smiling at me. 

While I was purchasing the tablet the man that was ringing me up said, Man, this is the best tablet for the money. I bought it for my son, and he has been learning so much from it. Now, I swear hes teaching me stuff I never knew! I chuckled and handed him my card. 

The entire car ride back my son begged me to take the tablet out of the box, but I told him to wait till the morning. He huffed and sighed, but I could tell he was excited for the morning.

After my son went to bed I spent about and house setting up the tablet. Its one of those kid safe tablets that allow the parents to restrict apps, amount of usage time, and websites. Once I was satisfied with the restrictions I plugged the phone and tablet up and went to bed. 

I woke up the next morning to my son bouncing on my chest. Teasingly, I asked him, What do you want? He started to scream out tablet while I laughed and unplugged the tablet and handed it to him. With a squeal of delight, he ran out of my room. The distant sound of clicking from the tablet made me smile as I fell asleep again. At 9:45 I woke back up again and walked out into the living room to see my son was working on a little puzzle on the tablet. 

The day went by smooth. When the 4 hour mark hit my sons tablet locked up and he brought it to me. I told him that he would have to play with something else for 5 hours before he could play with the tablet again. I readied myself for a fit, but he just smiled and said, Okay! before running off into his room. 

Three hours later, I heard the sound of sirens coming from a distance and stopping close to my house. I peeked out the house and saw two cops running into my neighbors house. I opened the door and stepped out and saw my neighbor open the door and walk outside with his arms up. My son walked out the door and stood beside me. Before I could get him back inside he said, He fucked his dead wife. Did it after her skull with a hammer while she slept. 

I turned around and stared at him before asking, You dont say stuff like that, Eric, who taught you that? With a smile he looked up at me and asked, Taught me what, Jared? While I tried to think of what to say he ran into the house and into his room.

The entire time we ate dinner I tried talking to him, but he would just look up at me and say, Tablet before resuming his meal. When he ate all that he wanted he got off of his chair and went to his room. When I finished my dinner I went up to his room and saw that he was already asleep. With a sigh, I walked in and took his socks off before tucking him and giving him a kiss on his cheek. 

I plugged up his tablet and my phone and attempted to sleep, but I couldnt keep my eyes closed. The concern for my son overwhelmed me, and after several hours of tossing and turning I got out of bed and went through the entire tablet. Two hours later, I finally plugged the tablet back up to the charger and went back to bed. 

Yesterday morning, I woke up to the sound of voices coming from the living room. When I walked out to the living room my son pointed at the tv and said, Told you. Our local news channel was talking about what my neighbor did. He was convicted of murdering his wife and storing her body in his wine cellar. I felt the blood rush from my face while I turned the tv off. My son got off the couch and ran into my room. He came back out with his tablet and started messing around with a couple of games on it. 

I looked over his shoulder the entire time he was on the tablet. The only odd thing he did was clicking on the browser and stayed on the page the front page while staring at the screen with more fascination than the entire time he was on his tablet. He kept staring at it until the screen blacked out and went to the lock screen. Without a word, he handed the tablet back to me, but before he ran off he looked at me and said, Grandma and Grandpa killed my mom. They poisoned her, but you were too stupid to know. 

I picked the tablet up and begged for it to tell me. When I unlocked the tablet it just went to a black screen before white letters appeared on the screen. It said, Stupid Man.

My son and I went back to Wal-Mart to return the tablet, but when they tried to process the refund they told me that the tablet was never on their system. I took the receipt out of my pocket and gave it to them, but the girl looked at me and said, You need to leave. When I tried to reason with her she just got madder and said, Im tired of people thinking they can say whatever they want to me just because I work here. My son loves me. He will always love me. Fuck off, you piece of shit. She threw my receipt back at me. When I picked it up off of the ground I noticed that the receipt now only said one thing, Just accept it. Youre a sad excuse of a parent. Your son will never love you.

After I put my son to bed I tried sleeping, but every time I started to fall asleep I would hear my wifes voice say, You could have saved me, but you were just too foolish. Every time I looked up I would see my son standing at the doorway. 

I woke up this morning after sleeping for just two hours. I dont know who to turn to. This is my last hope, Please guys. Help me. Im scared, and for the first time in my life I truly dont know [what to do] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> An App Called "New Eyes" Has Taken Over Our Town </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I dont remember what my wife and I were arguing about, but it lasted for more than three days. About three weeks ago, I came home from work and prepared myself for the incoming argument, but when I walked in through the door my wife jumped into my arms and planted me with kisses. Pleasantly surprised by the change of pace, I started to relax and asked her what the kisses were all about. 

While rushing back to the kitchen she yelled out, Ill tell you after dinner, honey! She brought out a large pizza from Papa Johns and I let out a quiet chuckle. She was never much of a cook. I couldnt blame her. She was the towns only dentist so she was almost always busy. We watched a little bit of tv while we ate, but my mind was distracted. It wasnt like her to end an argument so abruptly.

As soon as I finished off the last slice of pizza my wife put her phone on my lap. The screen was filled with a pink background and little blue dots that floated around the screen leaving trails that vanished after a second. I looked at her, but with a soft voice she whispered, *Tap the screen three times and dont take your eyes off of the phone.*

Feeling curious, I tapped the screen three times and the screen went dark for a couple of seconds. I started to look back at my wife, but the screen flashed a white light twice and bounced to a park. 

It was the park that I used to go to with my mother and father, but the park was demolished 7 years ago and both of my parents passed away while the park was still standing. On the phone screen I saw myself walking around the park looking depressed, but a smile quickly took over my face when my mother and father walked up to me. Both of them looked like the last time I saw them, but they looked perfect. 

My father didnt have a limp on his right leg, and my mother didnt need a cane to walk. We all walked around the park while we walked around and I could hear, inside of my head, my mother talking about how proud of me she was. My father kept making the same corny little jokes he used to make. As we made our way around the park for the fifth time the screen shut off and I noticed that I had a smile on my face. 

It was only for a short time, but I was completely at peace for the first time in my life. I looked at my wife and she asked, What did you see? 

With a teasing voice I said, Dont tell me you didnt look at what I was watching. She laughed and scooted up closer to me while saying, It doesnt show the other person what you are watching. If someone tries to see what you are looking at they will only see a black screen. 

After I told her about seeing my parents and the park I asked her where I could get the app. She told me that a friend of hers gave it to her because it was still in development, but she could send it to me through Bluetooth. I dont really know much about phones so I let her handle that when we walked back into our room. After she put the app on my phone I put it on my side table and plugged the charger in. The app was called New Eyes. The icon for the app was a bright pink box with a small pair of eyes inside. I thought about opening up the app, but something in my mind stopped me from clicking it. That night I fell asleep to the sound of my wife letting out happy sighs. 

I woke up three times that night, and each time I woke up I saw my wife glued to her cell phone. I tried asking her what she was doing, but she didnt respond to any of my questions. When I woke up the next morning she was still asleep. I gently shook her till she woke up and I noticed instantly that she barely got any sleep at all the night before. Her eyes were bloodshot red and her face was a lot more pale than usual. I asked her if she was okay and she just nodded at me before going into the restroom and got ready. 

It was the same thing every single night after that. Last week, she started to refuse to eat or drink any water. I tried to take her to the doctor, but she refused to go with me. 

I couldnt take it anymore. Five days ago I called 911 and silently waited next to my wife while she kept staring at the black screen on her phone. When the paramedics arrived they quickly picked her up and managed to strap her onto the gurney while she screamed and flailed her arms and legs around.

Two days ago, I noticed something that has made me start to panic. I work at the local bakery as the cashier. When I walked into work both of the bakers were standing together and staring into their phones. When I walked up to them to see what they were looking at I only saw a solid black screen. They were both smiling, but their smiles quickly vanished when I snatched their phones from their hands and placed them on the counter.  I gave the phones back to them a couple minutes later, but I told them to not use them out in the open while we worked. 

Almost all of the customers that walked into our store were glued to their phone. When I asked for their order they would respond back in monotone voices. Even the repeat customers that always asked how my day was would just come up and slam money on the counter while telling me what they wanted. If I asked them a question they would ignore me. 

Stressed and scared out of my mind, I went home as soon as my shift ended at 4 pm. 

I called out of work yesterday. I just couldnt handle whatever was going on. I thought about visiting my wife in the hospital, but I decided to just go the next day. My phone buzzed twice, but when I clicked the power button there wasnt a notification. It was New Eyes blinking from a bright pink to a deep red. Disgusted, I shut my phone off and fell asleep before the sun went down. 

I woke up today at 10:45 and prepared myself to go see my wife since it was an off day. After I got dressed, I went to my car and drove to the hospital. The first thing I noticed was the lack of cars in the parking lot. When I walked inside and up to the front counter there was no one there. Ten minutes of waiting later, I lost my patience and checked the log book behind the counter. My wife was in room 203. 

Once I found the room I walked inside and saw two nurses sitting in the corner of the room staring into their phones. My wife was lying on the bed staring into her phone. Her cheeks were sunken in and the skin on her face has started to sag. I greeted her, but she did not respond. With tears of stress rolling down my cheeks, I grabbed at my wife and begged her to speak to me, but like the lifeless doll she has become, she did not respond back with a single word. 

Only when I grabbed the phone out of her hand did she acknowledge my existence. She pointed her finger at me and began to scream. With a raspy voice I never heard her speak in she yelled, You are not real life. This is not real life. Before I could stop them the nurses ran up to my wife and repeatedly stabbed her with their knives. The whole time my wife laughed while saying, This is not real life. I know. I know. Im coming. Accept me with open arms. 

After my wife went silent they turned to me and started walking towards me while chanting, You arent. No. You arent part of the new world. 

I ran out of the hospital before they could reach me. I got into the car and drove like a madman until I pulled into my driveway. I tried calling the police, but every time they answer I hear someone breathing heavily into the phone while whispering, New world is coming. You arent one of use. Give yourself up. We will accept you [with open arms.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TEXT> yes:/ but if you think about it. in a town as close as it is. 

We have to think about the OOC community and not NoSleep. It is exactly like someone trying to open a bar in a town that already has one, but the response would be the same. 

People would still go to the original bar, and the other guy would get constantly shamed until either 

1) He gives up quickly and leaves town.

2) He doesn't learn and continues to stay falling deeper and deeper into bankruptcy.

Granted the responses were hostile, but it is just a prime example of how much we really care about the work that others do here. They defend us as writers, and we defend them as people that help us grow. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Interviews With 5 Unwilling E-mail Scammers [Part 1] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-07 14:09:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello my name is Mark Smalls, and I have a total of 5 people to interview. These are people that would be hated in every other situation, but what they have gone through will make you think otherwise. 

When the cops entered into the house they found three men and two women huddled up together in the middle of the floor and stared intently into the laptops that were placed in front of them. They were completely naked and noticeably malnourished. You would think this only happens in third world countries, but this took place in the heart of Raleigh, North Carolina. 

Currently, they are living in a small building in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. We were given a small building to house them in. They each have a room and we provide all of them 3 meals a day. The only person to eat all of the meals and show any type of improvement is Klay White. 

That is why I took him to the local park to interview him first today.

I have logged in the interview for you guys because I really dont know what to make out of his answers, and weird shit has started to happen during and after the interview. 

Date: **March 6th, 2017**.

Name of Interviewee: **Klay White** Will refer as **KW**

Me- What exactly happened in the house we found you in? What were you doing in there?

KW- Well, we were given laptops when we arrived in the house. We were each given a script that we could use.

Me- How did you end up at the house?

KW- Four months ago, while I was walking around and picking up applications for a new job a man approached me and asked if I needed to make some quick cash. Normally, I would just ignore someone like that, but he seemed different. He spoke with such confidence, and he was wearing a nice suit. I nodded at him and he told me that I could work from home. He would provide a place for me to stay, food for me to eat, and enough cash to make me happy. 

*Klay White was quiet after that for about 6 minutes. He kept staring at the basketball court while rubbing his hands together.*

Me- So, um. How did they take you to the house?

KW- Oh, right. Sorry. After I told him I was interested he pointed at a building that was a couple of feet from where we were standing. As soon as I followed him inside I felt something hit the back of my head and everything went black. When I woke up I found myself sitting alone in a room. 

Me- Were there any more people in the house before we got to you?

KW- Yes, just a month ago we had 14 people in our room. Seven of them decided to group up and escape, but right as they opened the door we heard the sound of gun shots and the bodies were covered in blood before they fell to the ground. 

Me- What did you guys do in there? All we got from the laptops were just e-mails you guys sent out. 

KW- Did you look at the e-mails? Thats all we did. Every day when we wake up we go to our laptop and find a new list of e-mails we have to contact. We would then act like a prince with too much diamonds in his inventory for the next 4 to 5 hours. When we finished the list of e-mail addresses we sat around and waited till we got a response back.

Me- What if you dont get a response back? You were sending what seemed to be scam e-mails. 

KW- I was getting to that. 

Me- Sorry.

KW- We had quotas we had to meet. We needed to get at least 8 people to send us the money each month. If they sent us any less than $500 then it would not count. If we managed to get them to send us $1000 or more we would get a hot meal the next day. If we only met half of the quota for the month we would receive 2 meals a day. If we failed to reach half we would get 1 meal a day. If we continuously underachieved we would be taken outside. I dont know what they did, but they never came back again. Happened to a woman and a man.

Me- Never learned what they did to them?

KW- Nope.

Me- What was a regular meal? 

KW- It was the same for every meal. Two pieces of bread and half a fish.  I have received 9 hot meals while I was there and that was the same every time too. A small piece of steak and two slices of toast with butter.  It doesnt seem like much, but to us that felt like a meal fit for a king.

Me-Did anyone else come into the room?

KW- Well, the man that brought me here would bring us our food. He would occasionally come in to bring a new worker into our room. Besides him, we would get a couple of people come in from time to time to look at us, but they always had a mask over their heads.

Me- What kind of mask? Could you describe their height or something unique about their body?

KW- It looked like an infants face, but red marks were drawn underneath the eyes. They were all pretty much the same height. I would say around 510. If they had anything specific about them I wouldnt be able to tell you. They all wore the same gray suit and white button down shirt.

Me- Is there anything else you could tell me? Anything that you think would help us catch the men that trapped you guys?

*Klay White has started to laugh uncontrollably. He grabbed my shoulder, but I managed to pull out of his grip. While I tried to settle him down I saw a man in a gray suit watching us through what looked like a mask from the other side of the park. I tried calling out to him, but he ran off.*

KW- Catch them? You plan on catching hundreds to maybe thousands of people? Haha. Im sorry, but thats just not possible. This house wasnt the only one. How do I know? The man would gloat about his operation every single day. He would brag about having over 300 buildings with workers all around the East Coast. Sorry man. You saved us, but you really fucked yourself over on this one.

*Klay has started laughing again. I tried speaking to him several times after, but he will not settle down.*

**End Interview**

Its now 1:45 at night and I cant go to sleep. I kept tossing and turning on my bed, but nothing worked. So I wrote this out to you guys for a cry for help. Every time I look out the window I keep seeing the man in the gray suit and the bloody infant mask. I called the military police twice tonight, but each time they came out [they didnt see anyone there] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After a long and thoughtful sigh my boyfriend asked me, Babe, look at the stars. Do you see anything that reminds you of, you know, us? I looked long and hard at the stars, but after searching for an answer in the stars I drew a blank. When I gave him a look of confusion he laughed and grabbed my chin while saying, I love it when you look confused. It makes it seem like I can teach you something new. He pointed at the skies and I stared at the direction he pointed and after a couple of seconds of complete focus I managed to see a girl and boy lying on what seemed like a blanket.

The boy was laughing, but the girl looked like she was scared. The eyes on her face were wide open and the lips were opened up as if it were screaming. I felt the blood rush from my face and into my heart causing it to beat faster when my boyfriend looked deeply into my eyes and stuck his hand into my shirt and his fingers crept towards my bra. With a layer of fear clearly in my voice I said, Henry, please. I dont want it right now. He just laughed and said, Cmon its not like its the first time. He ripped my bra off and before I knew it his lips were on mine with his tongue halfway into my mouth.

I screamed and shoved him off of me. He fell off of the top of his car and landed on the ground. When he didnt move for a couple of seconds I slid from the roof of his car and onto the ground before I took off running. While I was running I felt the tears of betrayal spill from my chin and onto the soft ground my feet slammed on.

In the distance, I heard Henry call out, Emma come back! I was just teasing babe. We can work it out. Please. I swear I was just kidding!

Swallowing the snarky remark I had for him, I kept running towards the direction to where my house was.

Henry picked me up from my house, but we drove into a spot in the woods that was only 2 miles away from our house. My father was not happy about me having a date, but I begged him enough to the point to where he just told me to go as long as I could give him a couple of hours of peace. As I am running I start wishing my father just never let me leave. I wish he told Henry that I wasnt ready to go on a date with. With the thought of being at home encapsulated into my heart I held my pace and kept running towards my house.

Henry kept yelling at me while he ran towards me. Every time he yelled at me his voice seemed closer. Right as I reached the end of the woods I felt a hand grab my shirt and I fell backwards onto the soft earth. I tried squirming out of his grasp, but he placed his two hands on each of my shoulders and started to yell at me. We were meant to be together babe. I dont care you keep running away from me. I know. I just know. You and I were meant to be together. He tried to bend down to give me a kiss, but I shoved his face away from mine with the palm of my hand and got to my knees.

Before I started to run away from him again I looked back and saw that he was lying on the ground sobbing quietly into the grass that surrounded him. Scared and desperate, I kept running away from the moon and towards me house. Henry still tried to get to me, but before he got to me I managed to get back into my house. I used all three locks on the door, double checked and made sure that door couldnt be opened, ran to my room, locked the door to my room, and dove under my covers.

After a couple of minutes I heard knocking at the door. When I saw my father walk out of his room and towards the door I tried to call out to him to keep the door closed, but my throat wouldnt cooperate with me. Before I surpassed my fear and started to call out to my father, he opened the door and Henry started to talk to my father. I couldnt really hear anything. I pressed my ear up to the door and heard my father tell Henry, Yeah, shes in her room right now. Go talk to her or whatever you have to do. Im too tired to even protect her anymore. Do whatever you have to do.
Henry started going up the stairs to my room.

As the steps grew louder with each passing second I grabbed the knife from my desk and waited on my bed.

He came inside my room with a smile on his face. Before he could get any closer to me I let out a scream and plunged the knife into his face. I kept slamming the knife into his face until he stopped breathing.

A total of 10 times.

My dad came up and started screaming and ran up to Henrys fallen body. He asked me, How could you do this to your husband? What the fuck is wrong with you. I got you out of the psychiatric hospital because we trusted you. Henry convinced me, but he shouldnt have. Your ass should have just stayed th-.
His sentence was cut off by the knife that entered into the right side of his throat. My father took 14 stabs before he stopped breathing.

Im tired of people controlling my life. I know that I was never married. I know that my father was always a piece of shit. He was the one that laughed when he learned about the death of my mother 10 years ago. Henry was just like my father. I knew him before. I dont know how I knew him, but Im almost completely sure I never married him </TEXT>

Of course, i would love the thought of making extra money on the side, but the publicity makes it w9rth it to me.

I have yet to finish my first book, but when i do i can at least know some of the followers i gain from the narrations will provide just that many more book sales. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so here goes.

I am a 17 year old working as an apprentice in a computer repair shop, and my life has been great. 

Until yesterday.

So, for a little context, this computer repair store is in a little village a few miles away from my town, only me and my mentor( the store owner) Mike works here, and we are struggling with customers. 

Not for the normal reasons of no customers mind you, Mike offers a free 3 year warranty on all repairs we do, because we are truly the best around.

However, as it is only us two working, it takes a lot longer to test and repair systems, so customers often get annoyed and agitated at our lackluster speed. Anyway, enough back story, time to get into this tale.

<TEXT> Team: **Constipated Monsters With a Dish Full Of Green Meat** Working Title: **I Have Fallen Into Some Sketchy Debt**

Being a college dropout and working at an office supply store makes it pretty obvious that I do not make a lot of money. Even with being promoted to Assistant Manager I can hardly meet ends meet while paying for my single bedroom apartment, utilities, and the ramen noodles and occasional TV dinners I eat for the month. 

Though I can never spoil myself or necessarily eat 3 meals a day; I have learned to adapt to it, and still managed to remain happy to have finally moved out of the hotel I was living in 2 years before. Though it put a strain on me financially I was just glad to be able to bring friends and family over without having everyone constantly worry about where I am living. Of course, I really do wish I could get a credit card so that I can manage to raise my credit score and start utilizing my money better, but due to people taking advantage of me when I was eighteen my credit is completely unsalvageable.

One day last month when I went to work I finally received my first chance at having my own credit card. I woke up, got dressed, and ate a snack cake just like any other day, but when I got to work I saw a man standing outside with a table and a sign that read Credit Approved for Everyone!!! Well, that grabbed my attention instantly because unlike most 100% credit approvals this was actually for a card and not some payday loan. So I walked up to the table and checked out of one of the many pamphlets that littered his table.

After talking to the man, which had a voice of a basketball game announcer, I realized that this card seemed like it was simply too good to be true. They do not pay attention to your credit score, no security deposit, there was only one catch, and that was that you have to use a minimum of 250 dollars on the card and there is an automatic 4.5% interest fee. So they make money from you every single month you have the credit card, but I dont mind since I can finally try to start raising my credit score up!

After I am done filling out my information the man tells me that I will get my card shipped to my address within the next 3 days. So with excitement flowing through every part of my body, I practically jumped into work and got through the day in the best mood I had been in years. While I was walking home I decided to treat myself and got myself some Lasagna at the local Italian restaurant and enjoyed every last bite on the plate. 

When I got home I noticed that there was a letter in my mail slot so I grabbed it and walked upstairs to my room. Once inside, I tossed the letters on the coffee table and watched some TV. When that got boring I looked around the room to find something else to do and realized I had completely forgotten about the mail. The only thing was, there were 2 letters when I know for a fact that I only grabbed one. I dismissed it off by blaming being over excited about the new credit card and check the letters.

The first letter just contained a cheesy flyer from my landlord telling me that my rent is due next week and to remember about the New Tenant party he is having for all of us on Friday evening. After throwing the letter in the trash can I flipped the other letter over and notice there was absolutely nothing written on it. I tore open the letter to find a single piece of paper and a card inside. 

The writing on the paper was handwritten and stated *unlimited credit limit. 250 dollar minimum spending limit. Automatic 4.5% interest. You do not want to make a late payment. Enjoy.*

<TITLE> If You Find A Man Name Double M At A Rave Please Don't Buy Molly Off Of Him </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-02 14:04:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When you go to an all ages rave you go in with minimal expectations. You dont really wanna hit on a girl and find yourself leaving a two story house with a cop leading you out. Handcuffs digging into your skin while you try to avoid the stares of rage from the parents of the underage girl that seduced you with her night stick tricks the night before. Thats not my story though. That was Jeremy 3 weeks ago. 

I was smarter than him. I just go to these raves to enjoy the music. This time I went alone for the first time. As I walked into the club I was hit by the smell of sweat and alcohol. I flashed my id to the bouncer and walked up to the bar. Once I got my screwdriver I made my way into the middle of the floor and closed my eyes while feeling the bass that the dj was sending my way. 15 minutes later a man tapped on my shoulder. I turned around and saw a guy in a Pink Floyd shirt. He mouthed out looking? 

With a smile I put up two fingers and he put two capsules in my hand while I handed him a twenty. I popped the first capsule of molly in my mouth and after 20 minutes I lost myself in a sea of euphoria and perfect rhythms. 

A girl started dancing on me. I tried to stop her, but she stuck even closer to me. With a couple of pushes I finally managed to get away from her and ran to the water fountain in the back. The guy I bought the molly from was standing next to the fountain and staring into the rave with a small smile on his face. After I drank enough water to counteract the cotton mouth I was experiencing I asked the guy if he was alright. He turned to me and took out a pack of cigarettes and pointed to the smoking area. I nodded my head.

Once we got out there he turned to me and held out of his hand while saying, Name is Mike but people call me Double M. I took his hand and told him my name was Gregg. After a couple of drags from his cigarette he asked, So were you trying to get some more? I shook my head no and said, Nah man, just wanted a second away from the rave. Some chick force grinded me and Im trying to lay low until she finds another guy. He let out a short laugh and slapped my back. Yo man, if you wanna chill sometime hit me up. Mike handed out his hand and I handed him my phone and waited while he put in his number.

After our second cigarette he said, You might wanna get back in cause it looks like youre about to peak like a mother fucker. I noticed I started to breathe really heavily and nodded at him before walking back inside and in front of the stage. The song started to progress and my deep breathing transitioned to short breaths that matched the rhythm of the song. Right as the beat dropped I instinctively lurched my chest out and got on my tiptoes before jumping up and down to the drop. 

This was unlike any experience I have ever felt in my life. Every single worry dripped away from me and was soon replaced about thoughts of just absolute happiness. 

Nothing in particular.

Just plain happiness. 

A huge smile formed on my face and I let out a cry of absolute bliss. People around me started to join in and we were harmoniously exclaiming our love for the moment we were in. 

The next 2 hours, were the happiest moments of my life, but as the roll started to fade away I noticed that the people that surrounded me were still smiling while occasionally screaming out in glee. I started to make my way to the back to get an orange juice to take my next capsule with before noticing that the screams were starting to change. A couple of screams went from absolute happiness to complete pain, agony, and fear. The type of screams you would expect to hear from the depths of hell. I ran back into the crowd and noticed that several people were lying on the ground and clawing at their faces. 

The bartender ran up next to me and dialed 911 on his phone while shouting that he needed several ambulances. One girl in particular stood out to me. Her lips were starting to rip at the sides. She was screaming in agony but her smile was getting wider every single second. She started to cry as the people around her looked at her desperately while they continued to jump up and down with their fists in the air and a smile on their face. 

The paramedics rushed into the rave less than 10 minutes later. They started to pick up the bodies from the floor and onto the gurneys. 

When they picked up the girl and carried her outside I followed them and stayed close to her. They asked her what her name was. In between her sobs she managed to spit out, Chey before her body started to contort in unnatural positions. They tried to get her into the ambulance, but before they got her inside bubble purple liquid started to froth out of her mouth. Cheys body started to contort into unnatural positions before I heard a loud crack and she stopped moving. The paramedic to my right walked up to her and felt her neck. After a couple of seconds he tried reviving her with CPR. When that didnt work they shoved the gurney she was on into the ambulance and used the defibrillator three times before looking at each other and shaking their heads.

I managed to drive back home, but the smile wont leave my face. I tried to think of every single unhappy thought I could, but the smile keeps slowly growing. 

This is a warning. If you meet a man named Mike or goes by the name Double M please do not talk to him. Above all else do not buy [anything from him] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

[2nd Part] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5wgvoc/i_wish_i_was_never_unknowingly_recorded_for_a/)

When the final bell rang I stayed in the school restroom for 30 minutes before taking a couple of deep breaths and took out my fathers pistol. I stuck the pistol in the back of my pants and walked out of the restroom. My body wouldnt stop shaking the whole walk there, but I managed to walk to Mr. Smiths classroom. As I got up to the classroom I heard shuffling inside. When I tried peeking through the small window on his door Mr. Smiths face smashed into it. I jumped back and watched his face get sliced up by the glass it went through. 

I turned around and started to run towards the front doors of the school but halfway there I was lifted up by the back of my shirt. I tried kicking and punching the man that grabbed me, but he was far too strong. He ran all the way to the back of the parking lot and threw me in his car. Before I could even open the door and run away he got into the car and held on to my arm while he started up the car and started driving. 

For the next 5 minutes I couldnt say anything. I tried thinking of something, anything, to say, but the words just wouldnt come out of my mouth. A cough came from the back seat and I turned around and saw a little kid sitting in the car seat. He was staring at me, but he didnt say anything. After a couple of seconds the kid held out his hand and instinctively I grabbed his hand and held it. 

The man looked over at me and tears were running down his chin and onto his shirt. He patted my shoulder before saying, Im sorry. Im so sorry. Three days ago I found a letter in my mailbox. There wasnt an address on it or anything. The only thing written on the envelope was my name. The letter inside told me there was a way I could get my son back. I love my son, and by that time I was desperate to try anything. You gotta understand man. He means more to me than even my own life or anyone elses life. They gave me a facebook account I could upload a video I took of you. They didnt tell me what you would do, but just that I would know what to record. 

He wiped his tears with his sleeve and the kid let go of my hand before he continued. That man. You called him Mr. Smith, but to me he is just a piece of shit. He owns a daycare center with his wife. The same daycare that I sent my son to. They have a creature down there. Call me crazy if you want. Anyone else would. They have some fucking creature down there that eats children. Children like mine. Children that they think are imperfect. My son is just a shell of what he once was. The way he just held your hand. Thats how he used to hold mine when he was scared.

Silence filled the car until the boy in the back asked, Where is my plane daddy? The man let out a sob, but he remained silent for the next couple of minutes. 

After a deep sigh the man said, My name is George, by the way, and little mans name is Henry. I took the hand he stuck out and shook it while telling him my name was Martin. He asked me if I had family, and I told him that I had a mother and father but they never really talked to me or gave me attention. George slowly nodded his head and stared at the road as he kept driving and I looked over at Henry. The little kid started fidgeting and grabbed at his stomach. I turned to George to tell him that Henry seemed to be having stomach problems, but before I opened my mouth Henry started to scream. A scream that was filled with more anguish and torture I had ever heard in my life. 

When I turned back around and looked at Henry I saw that his midsection was torn opened and what seemed like miniature pale people started to crawl out. They were around 3 to 4 inches tall and slid around Henrys body while leaving a line of slime. I cried out in shock and fear, but George stared at the road while tears continuously dripped down his cheeks. 

After a couple of minutes George stopped the car and dragged Henrys body out of the car seat and shook the little creatures off of his. As they dropped from the toddlers body they started to move towards the direction of where the sun was. A couple of them exploded on impact and left a mixture of green sludge and tiny broken bones. 

Curiosity got the best of me and I bent down to take a better look at one of them. They had every characteristic of a full grown human despite the size, but the face looked like a face a baby would have. The creature turned around and stared me down before jumping up and latching onto my right cheek. I screamed out in pain as the creature started to bite a chunk off of my cheek. George quickly grabbed the creature and threw it into the woods. 

He grabbed me and threw me back into the car before getting into the drivers side and drove off. I looked at my face in the mirror and saw that there was a dime size chunk ripped off of my cheek. Blood was pouring down my face, but the pain was gone. Even when I dabbed at the gash on my face I did not feel anything. 

I looked at Henry and my mouth dropped as I saw his midsection mending itself. In a matter of seconds he was sitting up in his chair and continued to stare at me. 

When I looked back at the mirror I saw that my face was perfectly fine. The gash was gone and a layer of perfect skin was surrounded by my acne filled face.

After four hours of the quietest car ride I had ever been on George parked in front of an old log house. We got out and I checked my phone. There was no service, but there was wifi here. I looked around my facebook when we got inside. A bunch of kids were talking about how Mr. Smith was killed. There were various rumors floating around but none of them were true. I checked the news and saw nothing interesting. Just whatever the fuck Trump was doing, who won the Oscars, but somewhere around the third page of the news there was a news story that caught my eye.

Several kids have gone missing. Some of them were found several hours later, but several parents were saying that the kids that came back home were different. They didnt show any emotions. There have been sightings of those creatures that I saw exit Henrys body, but there has not been a clear picture that has been taking. It is talked about the same way people would talk about Bigfoot. Just a mythological creature, but what confuses me is those creatures were tiny, but the people that were closer at describing out the creature said they were over 10 feet tall. They laughed like an infant and had a face of an infant, but was taller than anything they had ever seen. 

I dont even know if I can trust George or Henry, but after reading what George wrote to you guys. I cant help it. I just have to trust him, but I am scared. Henry could easily give birth to more of those fucked up creatures and I wouldnt be able to do anything when I fall asleep. 

Give me help guys. This shit is just not [getting any better] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My name is Martin and before today I was a nobody. I tried talking to the kids in my classes, but for some reason I was just deemed the school loser. My only friend was Dave, but he would ignore me whenever we were around other kids. Two months ago I tried asking Stacy to the homecoming dance, but by the next class I was laughed at for even thinking I had a chance with her. As you know when youre 15, social acceptance makes the difference between having a good high school experience or 4 years of temporary prison. 

I wanted more than anything to have a real friend, to have a girlfriend, or even an occasional conversation, but with each passing day I knew I had almost no chance. 

Yesterday, Dave started avoiding me. Every time I got close to him he would loudly say a joke about how ugly I was and quickly walk away from me as kids surrounded me and laughed. That is when I just gave up. I didnt want to live anymore, and I knew that the only for me to be happy is if I just took the rest of my mothers heart medicine I could escape the hell hole called earth. 

With tears rolling down my chin, I set the pill bottles on my desk and grabbed my guitar. I was going to play my final song. As my fingers plucked the final notes I put the guitar down on the ground and picked up the bottle of pills, but I saw a tiny red light in my bedroom window turn off. I ran up to the window and caught a glimpse of a shadow running around the corner of my house. 

Curious, I ran out of my house and walked around the neighborhood. After I walked around for an hour I noticed how perfect the weather was. I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. The feeling of calmness filled my body and I looked up at the starry skies. I dont know how long I stood there and stared at the skies, but by the time I walked back into my house I felt better than I have ever felt in my life. 

When I walked into my room I hear my phone buzzing. I thought it was a phone call at first, but the buzzing was far quicker. With just three steps I got to my phone and I noticed that it was an endless amount of notifications from facebook. Using my thumb I swiped right and got to my home screen. Next to the facebook app 99+ was on the top right. I tapped on the app and my mouth dropped. There were 48 friend requests, 71 messages, and the same 99+ symbol next to the notifications. 

I tapped on the notifications and my eyes landed on the fifth notification. Stacy commented on a video that was shared on my profile. Without a second thought I tapped on the notification and the screen bounced to my profile page and onto a video. A mixture of fear and excitement spread across my body as I saw myself playing the guitar just 2 hours ago. It was titled Look at the raw emotions involved in this private guitar solo 3. I wanted to be scared, but the adrenaline that filled me was impossible to ignore. There were over 300k views already, 13k likes, and 6k comments. My thoughts of suicide were quickly dismissed and I went to sleep happier than I have ever felt in my life.

This morning when I woke up I checked my phone to check that it wasnt all just a dream. Even after seeing that there were over 4.5 million views I just couldnt believe my luck. This morning I ran out the door before my breakfast and ran all of the way to the bus stop. The two guys that used to make fun of me while we waited greeted me with high fives and excitedly spoken compliments about how amazing I was at the guitar. When we got on the bus all of the kids that were sitting by themselves quickly made space for me and begged me to sit next to them. 

Still in shock by the sudden burst of popularity, I walked past all of them and towards my seat in the back. I stopped when Stacy grabbed my arm and patted on the seat next to her. Nervously, I sat next to her and stared at the back of the head of the kid sitting in front of me. The whole bus ride she tried to talk to me, but I just couldnt think of anything to respond back with. When the bus stopped in front of the school she turned to me and teasingly asked, You too much of a big shot to talk to me? I smiled at her and walked off of the bus and walked to my English classroom. Mr. Smith looked at me and smiled as I walked to my desk and when I sat down, he clapped his hands together and said, Now its time to begin! Remember to keep question for our little celebrity until after the class!

The whole class everyone stared at me. I caught Dave glancing at me a couple of times, but he would turn around whenever he saw me looking at him. After the class was over Dave tried coming up to me and started to say he was sorry, but before he got to me the rest of class surrounded me and asked me how it felt being famous. I tried responding to their questions, but a mixture of happiness and excitement overwhelmed me and I ran to my locker. There were still kids surrounding me, but I managed to get my locker opened and a little white note fell out. I picked it up and ran to the restroom and into the first stall that was unlocked. I unfolded the letter, secretly hoped it was Stacy, and started to read it. After I was done with the last word I dropped the letter and stared at the door to the toilet. 

It said, You owe me for the viral video. Find me after school. One favor for loneliness is worth more than the part I ask off of your body.

The rest of the day was filled with excited adolescents asking for my autograph and questions of how long I have been playing the guitar. A couple of kids asked for a shoutout for their page, but I was far too distracted to give them any attention.

Before the final bell rang I received two more notes in my locker.

One was before lunch and said, I really hope you show up. Im looking forward to it. Lets up it from a body part to your dedication. That okay to you?

The next one was before my final class. It said, If you dont show up you will die. If you dont do what I tell you the consequence is death. 3

After school I checked my locker and saw a final note. I quickly opened it. By the third tree at the end of the school parking lot. That is where you will find me. Dont bring anyone. That is just asking for death.

There were a couple of kids surrounding me, but I ran through them and through the parking lot. Dave was standing at the end of the parking lot and grabbed me before asking, Bro Im sorry for ignoring you. I just wanted friends. I was tired of being an outsider, and being your friend was making me lose out of other friends. Im sorry. Are you okay man? Youre pale as fuck. You need any help? I shook my head no and told him to leave. Regret apparent on his face, he got in his brothers car and they left.

I ran to the third tree at the end of the parking lot. 

I looked around, but I didnt see anyone around. After two minutes I started to feel relieved. That feeling was shattered when I heard a voice. It wasnt a humans voice. It belonged to what seemed like a computer. In a male voice it said, Kill Mr. Smith and come back to this spot. We will take care of the rest.

I tried asking how it would take care of it, but in the middle of my sentence it said, You dont kill him we will kill you. A question started to form in my head, but the air rose out suddenly right beside my right foot. I yelped and jumped up when I saw the remains of a bullet right where the ground rose up. 

With a stern voice it said, Three days. You have three days to kill Mr. Smith. After you kill him come over here and we will take care of it.

Im home now, and I decided to tell you guys what I just went through. I like Mr. Smith. I dont want to kill him. I dont even know how to kill him if I wanted to. 

Please help me. I just wish I ended my life before I put others [in danger] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TITLE> My Son Has Been Acting Strangely Since His 3rd Day of Daycare </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-26 14:29:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Even for a 3 year old, my son Henry showed his emotions far more than any kid his age. If anything made him happy he would scream with glee and laugh until his voice became hoarse. We loved it when he was happy, but his fits had become a problem. I know that it is very common for his age, but we wanted to find a solution. We were worried about how he would slam his head on the ground and claw at his arms. 

The online searches all pretty much told us to just be patient with him and that he would get over the phase, but it truly broke our hearts and we wanted to get some kind of help. 

One week ago I was at work and browsing around a parenting website when my manager came up to my desk. I tried to close out of the page, but he asked, You having kid problems? Without turning around, I nodded my head and told him that my sons fits seemed to be getting worse and worse. Chuckling, he put his hand on my shoulder and told me to give him a call after we got off of work. 

I got home around 7 and called him immediately. He asked me if it was a good time to stop by my house. After I got the confirmation from my wife I told him that it was fine. He quickly said, 15 minutes and hung up the phone. I helped my wife clean up the living room, but before we could finish cleaning my manager knocked on the front door. 

Right when I opened the door he rushed in and told me that he would make it quick. He handed me a pamphlet to a place called A New Me Daycare Center. The pamphlet had a bunch of pictures of kids happily playing with each other, but other than the title there were no other words written on it. I gave my manager a weird look, but before I could ask him, he told me that this is the place he took his son. It is only $450 a month, and he could see an improvement in his sons attitude within the first couple of days. 

After his mini pitch, he told us that his wife was waiting for him and told us to think about it before leaving.

That night my wife and I talked for over an hour about if this was a good idea or not. By 2 am we reached a mutual decision to at least try it out for a month. If he started acting better we would keep him there, but if anything seemed off we would just pull him out. 

Five days ago we dropped him off at the daycare center for the first time. He started crying at first, but when he saw the toys that surrounded him he became distracted. While I was watching my son playing I felt a hand grab my arm. I jumped in surprise from the contact, but when I turned around I saw a cheerful woman standing behind me. She started off by talking about how cute our son was, and asked him how old he was. We told him 3 and she started squealing while running up to him and gave him a hug. We expected him to push her off like he did with every stranger, but for some odd reason he hugged her back and started laughing when she spoke to him in funny voices. My wife and I looked at each other and smiled. 

Once she was done playing with my son she walked back to us and pointed to a room in the back. We followed her into the room and sat down on the chairs placed in front of a bright blue desk. She sat down behind the desk and took out a piece of paper. We started reading it, but she started asking questions about his allergies, weight, height, and if he was having any problems. I told her about the fits that hes been having. I expected her to get serious, but she just smiled and told us that they would try their best to make him stop having fits.

The next three days we took him to the daycare center at 7:45 am and I would pick him up after I got off of work at 6 pm. He was still having fits, but it was still helping my wife. She finally had time to work on her novel, and finally had some time to truly relax. We were happy for just that reason, but it all changed two days ago. 

On the ride home from school Henry was strangely quiet. I asked him if he was quiet, but he just stared at me with wide eyes without saying a word back. When we got home I started to get his toys out, but he just walked into his room without giving his toys a second glance. My wife made his favorite dinner that night, grilled chicken and broccoli, but instead of showing the same excitement he used to show he just sat at the desk and started shoveling the food into his mouth. It got to the point to where he had three pieces of broccoli and a huge chunk of chicken in his mouth. I tried to tell him he was going to choke, but he just swallowed the food without chewing it. I took the plate away from him. Instead of crying like he would normally do; he just looked at me and asked, Dinner over? I nodded yes and he hopped off his chair and walked to his room. 

After I finished eating I gave him a bath and got him into his pajamas. I got out a book to read his nightly story, but he just said Im tired. Im going to bed. Teasingly I asked, Oh youre too big for the stories now? In response to my question, he rolled over to his side and started to snore. 

I know I may seem weak, but I wanted to cry. I wanted to shout at him to just give me a smile before he went back to sleep, but I pushed my emotions aside. I reasoned with myself. He must just be tired from having such a long day. 

Defeated, I walked up to my room and went to bed. My mind was filled with too many thoughts to stay up anymore. 

Yesterday, I was a walking shell at work. My manager tried to joke with me, but I was far too distracted. He asked me if I was fine, but I just told him that my son was acting a bit weird. He didnt talk to me for the rest of the day. 

After work I stopped by the local toy store and got the toy airplane he had his eyes set on for the past 3 months. It was $800 because it came with a camera built into it so you can shoot videos while it flew in the sky. While I was checking out, the cashier told me that the plane I was purchasing was amazing and how he had one. I asked him what made it so special, and he told me how it was built to fly long distances and the camera could take up to 11 hours of videos. 

During the whole car ride home he was silent again. I tried making hints to him that I got him the plane he wanted, but he just kept his eyes on the road without giving me a single response. 

When we got home I told him to close his eyes and hold out his hands. Once he had his eyes closed and had both his hands out I placed the plane in his hands. When he opened his eyes he looked at the plane and said, Thanks before walking in to his room. He tossed the plane on the ground and sat on his bed. 

I was crushed. I didnt know what to do anymore. My son wasnt throwing fits anymore, but I wanted him to. I just wanted him to be my son again. Whatever was in his room was not Henry. For the next ten minutes I stared into his room to see what he was doing, but he didnt get off of his bed the whole time. I quietly walked up to his room and peeked inside. Henry was just staring at the wall while sitting cross legged on the middle of his bed. My wife walked up next to me and told me that dinner was ready. I walked in and told Henry to come eat, but he just shook his head no. That is when I lost it. I grabbed him by the arm and hugged him as hard as I could and plead with him. Please Henry; daddy is sorry for wanting you to be different. Please. Please do whatever you want. Just stop doing this. Im begging you. Please Henry please!

He shoved off of me and said he was tired before rolling over to his side and started snoring. When I turned around I saw my wife sitting on the floor crying. I tried to comfort her, but before I knew it I was sitting right next to her crying and pleading to any god that could hear us for our son back. We didnt eat dinner last night. We couldnt. By 9 pm we were both asleep.

I woke up two times last night. The first time was at 2 am and I saw Henry standing in front of our door. I tried getting up but sleep overtook me. The second time was at 5 am and he was standing right next to me. I asked him if he needed anything, but he just shook his head and ran to his room. 

This morning when I woke up I took him to daycare. My wife was still asleep and I knew that she would need the extra rest. I took his new plane with him and turned the video feed on when I dropped him off. 

I took the day off of work today. My wife and I sat in the living room all day today and stared off into space while our favorite shows played on the tv. At 4 pm I decided to pick him up early today. 

He came out without his airplane so I walked back in and grabbed it. I turned off the video feed and we drove back home in silence. Once again, when we got home he walked into his room. I gave my wife a kiss and walked up the stairs into our room and plugged up the cable from the plane to the laptop, and sat while the video loaded on the screen. 

Once it was done loading I opened up the video and started skipping around the video until I found what I was looking for. A kid I didnt see before in the daycare was throwing a fit. He was crying and hitting anyone that came close to him. The lady that we saw the first day we dropped Henry off came up from behind him and lifted him up. She carried him over to a bright yellow door and opened it. The first thing that caught my eye was the stairs that led into complete darkness. She held the boy in front of her face and gave him a smile before throwing him down the stairs. I heard a soft thud and she turned on the lights. A small white lump came out of the corner of the screen and slid forward. 

I looked away from the screen. When I looked back I saw the boy trying to crawl away with his face filled with fear. A skinny naked figure slowly filled the screen; the feet started from the bottom of the screen and its chest surpassed the top of the screen. There were cuts all across its body; it had pasty white skin, and arms that only stretched halfway down his midsection. As it slid closer to the boy the thing bent down to take a better look at the boy. I could only see the side of its face, but it sent chills down my spine. The body was white, but the face was unnaturally yellow. Its hair was a sort of neon blue, but there were only tufts of it on the top of its head. 

Feeling sick I thought about shutting the video off, but before I could even think twice the creature pounced down on the boy and swallowed him whole. Once it devoured the boy the creature looked up at the woman and I cried out in fear. The creature may have been taller than anything I had ever seen before, but it had a face of a newborn baby. The lady gave him a nod and the creature let out a laugh that belonged to an infant, but before it could finish laughing the creature started screaming and fell on its knees. The midsection started to bulge out in several places before an arm penetrated its flesh. The creature started to scream in pain as the rest of the body came out of its body. 

The creature slithered away and the body stood up. It was the boy that was just devoured, but he was calm. He only moved when the lady told him to. She snapped her fingers when the boy came upstairs and a man came up and carried the boy away. After a quiet 5 seconds she walked up closer to the screen and her face quickly filled the screen.

With a smile and the enthusiastic voice she used on me the first day she said, George, dont you think I would spot a camera from a mile away? I just wanted you to see that your son is, in fact, your son. Hes just a cleansed version. Dont be like the last guys that called the cops. They wont find anything. She set the camera down on the ground and opened the yellow door again and all I saw inside was a normal looking closet with old board games on the ground. She picked the camera back up and said, I think it would be best if Henry kept attending A New Me Day Care. The video program shut down and I found myself staring at the empty folder the video was just in. I tried unplugging the cable and plugging it back in, but the video is gone. I tried looking in recent files, but the video has completely disappeared.

I feel helpless guys. I really do. The regret I feel from even getting annoyed at my sons fits is overwhelming me. I cant even think straight. If you guys have ever come across anything like this or even have any suggestions please let me know. 

It may not be possible, but I will do anything to [get my son back] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> I Think My Father Is Becoming Something Worse Than Just Senile </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-25 08:38:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A couple of days ago my father walked inside of my house wearing a crown. I started laughing as soon as I saw him, but he looked at me with pure hatred in his eyes. He pointed his index finger at me and asked, Did I give you the permission to laugh? I got up and gave him a fake bow, but as I bent down he grabbed me by the hair and slammed me onto the ground. When I tried to get back up I felt something sharp cut the back of my neck. In between his uneven breaths my father bent down and said, You can get up now, but the next time you make a mockery out of me I will end your life.

I tried asking him if he was feeling okay, but before I could even finish my sentence turned around and walked towards his room. I walked upstairs to my bedroom and saw my wife lying on our bed and reading a book. She looked up from her book to give me a little smile, but a look of concern immediately took over. In a shaky voice she asked, Drew, are you okay honey? Why are you so pale? I told her I was fine. She was pregnant; I didnt want to get her worked up with what could just be a senile moment from my father. 

As the days went by my father progressively became more and more obsessed over his new made up status. It got to the point to where I would have to stand up whenever I saw him. Thankfully, I was the only one he treated like a servant. He acted completely normal around my wife and even acted excited whenever my future son would come up in their conversations. 

I figured I could just deal with my father until May 12th, the day my son is expected to be born. The next couple of days I did a good job of avoiding him, and things slowly started to go back to normal. My father even started to calm down, and I thought he would snap out of the phase. 

I lost all hope yesterday.

We had just purchased one of those assemble it yourself cribs for my son. I was setting it up in his future room when my father came in and sat next to me. Putting on the biggest smile I could muster up at that time I told him that I had everything under control. He didnt answer back; instead, he just stared at the part of the crib that was already built. With each piece I attached to the crib I could hear his breathing get slower and deeper. By the time I was halfway done he got up and started walking out of the door. With a sigh of relief, I started working on the crib in peace. About 10 seconds later I heard the sound of fast footsteps coming from behind me. I looked behind me, but there was no one around. My father ran in a couple of seconds later, grabbed me by my shirt, and asked, Where the fuck is Jerry? I know you know where he is. I shoved him back and told him I didnt know anyone named Jerry. He walked back up to me and said, Listen here peasant, youre lucky youre even alive right now. Just tell me where Jerry is and this can all stop.

I pushed past him and walked into the kitchen. My wife was eating a sandwich when I sat next to her. She tried asking me what was wrong, but I told her to finish her sandwich first. Once she was done eating I talked to her about what my father was doing. After I was done telling her she told me that we should look into a couple of retirement homes once the pregnancy was over. The conversation was put on hold when my dad walked into the kitchen. He sat at the table and snapped his fingers at me. I asked him what he wanted but he just pointed at the loaf of bread and then at the fridge. 

I made him a sandwich and placed it in front of him. After a couple of bites he spit out the last bite he took and threw the rest of the sandwich on the floor. Annoyed and a bit pissed off, I walked over to the counter to grab a couple of paper towels. When I walked back up to my father I threw the paper towels at him and told him to pick it up. With a sly grin on his face he retorted back, Clean what up? You feeling okay son? I started to point at the floor, but the sandwich was gone. There were a couple of streaks of mustard and mayo on the ground, but other than that it had vanished. 

I looked over at my wife, but she just shrugged her shoulders. Her face had gone completely pale, but I could see that she was just trying to rationalize what just happened. 

Nobody ate dinner that night. My father just forgot about having to eat, and my wife and I just did not have any sort of appetite anymore. My wife fell asleep at 8 pm. I was in the middle of a movie when I started to hear a noise coming from outside of our bedroom. When I opened the door I could hear what the noise was. It was the sound of a baby laughing. I slowly walked down the stairs and pressed my ear against my fathers bedroom door. The laughing was coming from inside of his room. 

I started to open the door but stopped when I heard my father talking. With a voice filled with happiness he said, I knew you werent gone Jerry. I knew you would come back to your papa. Your little brother is quite the disappointment isnt he? Hes just a peasant, a nobody, but you, you are everything I ever wanted. 

I swung the door open and saw my father sitting on the middle of his bed while tickling the air. He didnt even notice me stare at him for a couple of minutes. I closed his door and walked back up to my room.

Im sitting on my bed with a laptop now. I know at least some of you guys will know what I should do. I really need help right now guys. I dont think I can keep living with him for the next couple of months. 

Even as I write to you guys. I can hear the sound of [light footsteps running around our house] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TEXT> I was walking around the great fields of Nosleep.

Naive and lost, I kept digging deeper and deeper. You see, I just never really dived very deep into horror before. The more i read I started to fall in love with the stories and above all, the community. Though we fight and we squabble we always manage to come back as a unit of one. 

With determination filling my head I started to slam my hands on the keyboard and wrote my AWESOME, not really, first series and felt very proud to have finished something and put it out to the public. The upvotes were scarce, but i was hooked. 

I kept writing and i kept reading these amazing stories.

Here i am now. Afraid of scary movies, but loving the NoSleep community and everything that is within it.

TLDR: Not too much in to horror. Just NoSleep </TEXT>

<TEXT> but isn't it kind of like throwing a big heaping pile of shit into something that is supposed to be a celebration? 

We still leave the door open for them. They aren't kidnapped. We don't force them in. We just open it for them. They have the chance to close the door and walk away. 

Plus i have a lot of people read my stuff that doesn't even have a reddit account. We don't account for those people.

TLDR: Let's just celebrate and be happy. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Two days ago I woke up to the loud noises coming from the house next door. By the time I got up and looked out the window I saw a moving truck peeling out of my next door neighbors driveway. Normally for a fifteen year old boy that doesnt really matter, but for me it was the worst day of my life. It was my girlfriends family. Her name was Carrie, and she was the best person I had ever met in my life. The day before was our 1 year mark and she bought me a bright yellow balloon in the shape of a heart. It wasnt much but it meant the world to me. When they left without even a word I was filled with a mixture of anger and sadness.

I tried calling her 12 times, sent her over 20 messages, and tried messaging her on Facebook several times, but I never got a response from her. By the time it was 11 pm I gave up. I put my phone on the charger and just sat on my bed while staring at the house she just moved out of. I thought of all of the times we would just open up our windows and talk to each other. Her mother and father would sometimes walk up behind her and yell at me to stop bugging them at 12 at night, but we would never stop our nightly conversations. 

That was really the only times we got to talk. She went to a private school while I went to the local public school. So we would just walk around the neighborhood from 6 pm to 8 pm and talk from our windows for about an hour before we would both go to bed at around 11 pm. As my eyes started to tear up from losing my first love I saw the curtains from her window move. I sat up instantly and stared at the window. 

It started off as little movements, but after a couple of minutes, the curtains swung to the right side. I could see her figure standing there. I opened my windows and called out to her, but she took a couple of steps back and vanished in the shadows. I rubbed my eyes and tried to get a better look, but the curtains were back to where they once were and I couldnt look through her window anymore. That night I could barely sleep. Every time I would start to drift off I could see the curtains moving and my eyes would snap open. As the sun started to peak out of the clouds I finally managed to sleep. 

Yesterday was a Sunday, and I didnt wake up until 1 pm. When I walked into the kitchen my mom laughed at how tired I looked and made me a sandwich. I checked my phone while I ate my sandwich and saw that Carrie never messaged me back. I wanted to really believe that I saw her last night, but I knew it was just my mind playing tricks on me. Once I finished my sandwich I stayed in my room for the rest of the day. I didnt want to do anything. If I walked outside I knew I would just be reminded of the walks we took. If I even saw her house I knew that I would just feel depressed once more. I kept my curtains closed for the rest of the day and listened to some music while I read books on my bed.

At 5:30 I walked downstairs and ate dinner with my mother and father. We were pretty much quiet for the whole meal. My dad tried to say a couple of things, but after a couple of failed attempts to get us talking he finished his meal and went to his office. I was back in my room by 6. I started to read Grapes of Wrath when I heard the sound of whistling coming from outside. I walked to the window and pulled back the curtains. Carrie was walking around the neighborhood whistling the same little tune she always did. Excitedly, I opened the window and called out to her. She looked up and I fell back onto my bed. When she looked up at me I could see that half of her face was torn off. The exposed flesh on her face looked to be rotting. 

I sat on the floor in front of my window and tried to calm myself down. I looked back up and she was gone, but I could still hear her whistling coming from the distance. 

I tried. I really tried to keep my mind off of her, but no matter what I did I would end up thinking about the rotting face of Carrie.

I fell asleep at 11, but I woke back up around 3 in the morning. I could hear her calling out to me. I dont know how I could possibly explain how, but it just felt like it was coming from inside of my head. Groggily, I got out of bed and walked to my window. Carrie was standing in front of her window waving out to me. Her face was still in the same shape as when she was walking around, but she was still beautiful to me. She was still perfect. I was just happy to see her smile. I opened my window and waved back at her. 

The happiness lasted for five seconds. By the time she put her hands on the bottom of the window her parents walked up behind her and grabbed her. They closed the curtain and I heard her scream as loud as she could.

I dont know what came over me. It might have just been the exhaustion or the fear that has taken over me the last two days, but I grabbed my cell phone and I called the police. When they answered I told them about what was happening at the address Carrie used to live at. 

The world became silent after I hung up the phone. Peace overwhelmed every fiber of my being, and I finally slept peacefully. 

I woke up to loud sounds again this morning, but I felt a certain level of peace. A peace I never felt in my life. I walked downstairs and when my mother saw me she gave me a hug and told me that everything would be alright. I asked her what she meant, but she just told me that whatever happened for the last 6 months are finally over. 

I sat in my room while cops walked in and out of the house next door.

Carries house.

My father walked in and told me how proud he was of calling the police. How he was proud of me for finally moving on. 

6 months ago Carrie went missing. She was never found. The cops stopped looking for her, and her mother and father thought it was the perfect time to leave. 

Carrie was found in the attic. Her body was stuffed in the trunk. The police were looking for her parents now. 

Tonight as I stand in front of my window I can see Carrie. With the beautiful face I fell in love with we open our doors at the same time. Its time for me to get off of here, and talk to my [first and only love] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TITLE> Please Don't Walk On Unknown Trails </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-22 10:06:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the past six months, I have started to obsess over a little trail I passed by on the way to church every Sunday. I know it seems odd that someone would become so obsessed over a trail, but it was mostly the build-up of curiosity. It was far too small for a car to enter, and the trail was just a combination of brown dirt and large rocks. Another thing that interested me about the trail was the same three cars parked right in front of the entrance to it. They never moved from where they stood.  

I knew it was a dumb idea, but I just had to check it out. Today I left an hour earlier for church. That would give me more than enough time to check out the trail and get to church on time. I parked behind the other cars. 

I took my phone, a pack of cigarettes, and my extra battery with me and walked up to the trail. This may sound weird, but the ground looked to be a bit off. The dirt was gray with a bluish tint, and all of the rocks were perfectly white. As soon as I stepped onto the trail I felt a rush of emotions. 

I was suddenly hit with the need to cry, scream, and laugh. At the same time, I felt the absolute need to run. Confused and fearful, I unwillingly ran further down the trail.

I wanted to stop running, but it felt like my body was taken over. The trees started to surround me, but whenever I glanced down on the ground I could still see that I was on the trail. By the time I came to a stop there was only space for me and one other person to walk on the trail. I checked my phone, but my phone wouldnt catch any sort of signal. I turned around and tried to run back to where I came from, but I could barely move. After three steps I couldnt handle struggle anymore. I got on my knees and tried to crawl, but I found myself laying on the ground only a couple of seconds later. 

Regret was the only thing I felt at that point. I started to yell at myself, slammed my head on the ground, but nothing made me feel better. The only thing I could do now was to keep walking. 

After a couple of minutes, I saw a person walking the same direction I was, but he was moving at a much slower speed. As I got closer I realized how bad of a shape he was in. His back and his legs were covered in small cuts and deep lacerations. I ran up to him and tried to ask him if he needed help, but before I could even finish my question he grabbed me by my shirt and tried to throw me on the ground. It was easy to get out of his grip and I jumped away from him.

I tried to just walk away, but in my mind, I saw the man lying on the ground with his head ripped off. I have never been a violent person, but the very thought filled me with joy. I shook my head and tried to take the thought out of my mind. The man kept walking towards me but I ran off before he could even get close to me.

Once I got far enough away I checked my phone and saw that there was still zero signal out here. The time read 13:34. That couldnt have been right. I got to the trail at around 9:30. I was scared. I didnt have a grip on time anymore. The trees kept feeling like they were starting to surround me. I dont know when I blacked out, but a man was kneeling beside me when I woke up. I tried to run away from him, but he just calmly stood by and asked if I needed help getting out of here. 

He walked up to me, but I know he could still see I doubted him. With a calm and smooth voice, he said, If I wanted to kill you I would have done it while you were knocked the fuck out. He laughed a bit, and I felt my panic start to fade away. I dont know how, but before I knew it I was filled with rage. How fucking dare he tease me like that? Who the fuck does he think he is? I started running after him, but he wrapped his arms around me and slapped me in the face. He yelled out, Listen! This trail. I dont fucking know how or why but it is going to bring out your emotions. Mainly anger. You cant leave if you kill someone. Ive seen people try to leave. They are ripped to shreds. Not by anything, but by whatever the fuck is in the air. Get a hold of yourself. If you want to live, you have to focus on leaving.

We walked deeper and deeper into the trail. The deeper we went the worse it started to smell. I didnt look around. I already knew what surrounded us. While we walked we talked about what he used to do. He was a police officer, and he had a wife and three kids. He asked me what the date was and after I told him he slowly nodded his head. I could have sworn Ive only been here for 2 weeks, but I guess its been 3 years now. I could see the tears start building up in his eyes, but before they had a chance to drop he wiped them away. After a couple of seconds, he reached out a hand and said, The name is Gerald. I shook his hand and told him my name was Jake. 

As our formalities ended I saw a guy walking in front of us. Gerald stuck an arm in front of me and walked forward. I followed closely behind him. As soon as Gerald got close enough he punched the back of the mans head as hard as he could. The man fell on his knees and we started to run away from him, but the man quickly got up and started to chase after us. I looked back and almost threw up when I saw his face. His cheeks were completely missing. His teeth were black and it looked like his gums were rotting. Before I could take a better look the man stopped running and we got away. 

We kept running for what seemed like hours. I wanted to give up, but then I saw it. There was a clearing in the forest. I looked over at Gerald and he nodded his head weakly. We stopped at the end of the woods and noticed that there were fewer trees than what I remembered. 

I asked him if he was going to go with me, but he looked at me with what seemed like far more regret than I felt on the trail. You should go. Just remember to never come back in here again. It makes you into a different person. I loved my family, but we came into the trail together. My wife thought it was a good idea. Before the first sunset, I killed my wife. I tried to resist as much as I could but I blamed her for bringing us in. I dont want to talk about my two boys. I just cant. He started to sob and I walked up to him to comfort him, but with a scream, he grabbed me by my shoulders and threw me out of the trail.

I looked around and saw that I was back to where I began my trip. I walked to my car and drove home. It is now 3 in the morning, and I know I wont be able to go to sleep. So that is why I wrote this warning for you all tonight.

Please do not wander into [unknown trails] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> My Coma Has Introduced Me To A Different World </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-20 09:56:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I honestly just felt like I was waking up, but the look of excitement on my mothers face told me a different story. 

I tried to get up, but several hands swarmed around me and gently pulled me back onto the bed. I tried looking around but became very dizzy. 

I asked my mother, Where am I?

She just grabbed my hands and started to cry. 

My mother tried to go in for a hug, but a man dressed in white held her back and told her that it would be best to just give me a little bit of space. She nodded at him slowly and sat on the chair next to me. 

I blinked once and the room was empty. I tried to call out for help, but no one came. I looked around and saw a little remote on the side table and viewed my options. There was a couple of generic tv buttons and a button on the bottom right with a little face on it. I clicked it and turned on the tv to see if anything was on, but the channels wouldnt change. It just looked like some sort of weird reality tv show. The camera was pointed to a sofa and did not move. One boy suddenly got up from the couch and started to run towards the left side of the camera. 

The other boys on the couch looked terrified, but they didnt move a muscle. I tried to turn the volume up, but even at max volume, there wasnt a single sound. 

The nurse finally came in and asked me what I needed. I told him that I wanted to call my mother, but he just sighed and walked up to my bed. Hey man your mom will be back tomorrow. She said she was busy, but just try to get some rest. Youve had a rough 3 weeks. I tried asking him what happened, but he just turned around and walked out the door. I called out to him, but he completely ignored me. 

Slightly pissed off about being ignored, I grabbed the remote and pressed the nurse button three times; after that, I watched the tv. Three large adults with monkey masks came onto the screen and grabbed the boy who ran off the screen and threw a white cloth bag over his head. The tied his arms and legs together and then carried him off somewhere. 

Three minutes later the nurse came back in, but when I saw him I couldnt help but let out a scream. His forehead had a huge hole in it and blood was pouring down his face. He swung his head around the room and bits of his brain flew everywhere. I closed my eyes and tried to crawl off of the bed. I felt a hand touch me and I slapped them off of me. 

Cmon guy. I know something scared you, but you gotta talk to me. What is going on? What scared you? I started to crawl away, but he grabbed my knee and held it down against the thin mattress. I opened my eyes to find a way to get out of his grip when I noticed that he was completely fine. 

With a concerned look on his face he asked, You okay now? I nodded yes and stared back at the tv. The boys were back to just walking around the room and sitting on the couch. The nurse stared at me for a couple of minutes and finally broke the silence with another question. You keep staring at the tv. You want me to turn it on for you? 

I told him that it was on while I pointed at the tv. He chuckled and walked up to the tv and pressed the power button. What I was originally watching slowly faded away and was replaced with an overly excited woman talking about how to make the perfect Panini for your dinner guests.

That is when I knew something was wrong with me. Why was I seeing things? What the fuck was wrong with me? Why was I even here? What did he mean by a rough 3 weeks?

He asked me if I needed anything else, and I just shook my head. He gave me a pat on my shoulder and left the room.

I looked back at the tv and saw that the woman looked a lot older than before. I thought she was in her mid 30s but now she looked to be around 60 to 70 years old. Right as she put the Panini in the over she grabbed at her chest and fell onto the ground. The camera kept rolling and I could still hear her voice talking about what side dishes to make. I closed my eyes and opened them again to see that the woman was back to her 30s and shouting excitedly that the Panini was ready to get out of the oven.

I honestly didnt know what the hell was wrong with me. I just wanted to get some rest. 

Rolling over to my right side I closed my eyes, but I just couldnt sleep. The stress of every single unanswered question was killing me. Thought after thought kept coming in and I knew that sleep was impossible, but I still kept my eyes closed. At least this way I wont keep imagining any of this fucked up shit. 

After a while, I finally managed to clear out my head and started to drift off to sleep. Right as the first line of drool started to escape out of the corner of my mouth screams and the loud sound of gunshots erupted from the hallway. I immediately woke up and ripped the IV out of my wrist. 

I was trying to get up when a boy ran into my room. He ran up to me with a gun to my head and asked me if my name was Wes. I nodded at him. He yelled out Grant! Get your ass in here. A man that looked to be in his mid 30s ran in the room and smiled. He looked at the boy and said, Well Phil, didnt I tell you that he was gonna be in here? Dont mess with the mastermind. The boy punched Grant on the shoulder and they walked up to me. 

Before I could even move Grant grabbed me and slung me onto his shoulder and ran out of the room. My nurse tried to run up and stop us, but the boy shot him in the middle of his forehead. 

Once we got out of the building I realized that it wasnt a hospital. It looked more like a warehouse from the outside. I tried asking Grant what the fuck was going on, but he just told me that he would explain it in the car.

We got to the car and he threw me into the back seat. The boy got into the passenger seat and Grant sat in the front. It wasnt until 2 hours of driving when Grant finally started to talk. 

I know you must be full of questions right now, but I cant answer all of them right now. You needed to get out of there. You were one of 8 people they have kidnapped. They gain your trust by seeming like a completely legitimate hospital. 

I tried telling him that my mother was there, but he put a hand up.

Wes, try to remember. Close your eyes and try to remember what happened.

I closed my eyes and tried to concentrate on my mothers face. At first, it was the woman in the hospital, but then her face started to change. It kept changing until I saw the actual face of my mother. The mother who was shot 5 times in the chest; the mother I ran up to as she took her final breaths. My memories ended there. I couldnt reach back any further. My mind was blank.

When I opened my eyes back up Grant said almost in a complete whisper, I dont know how they made you forget everything, but you have a gift. You know how people die. We have several people like you in our organization. Join us. We will get rid of evil one person at a time. You can leave now if you want, but I think you need us as much as we need you. Here. Hold onto this.

He handed me a cell phone, and I tapped on the power button. 

It instantly came on and had only two apps.

The regular browser app which I am using to tell you guys what is happening.

Then the next app. Which I used to make the decision [To Kill] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was 14 years old my mother sat me down on the living room sofa and told me that she could not afford to send me to the private school I went to anymore. I tried to fake disappointment, but the excitement of going to a school with far less rules filled me with excitement. Dont get me wrong, I wasnt a bad kid, but at my old school we would get detention for even saying the word stupid. 

I told her I was okay with that, and with relief on her face she gave me a hug and told me that she would try her best to make this as good of an experience as she possibly could. 

Let me give you a little bit of background information about my earlier school days. From 1st-2nd grade I was the weirdo that walked around the playground and cried because no one wanted to play with him. 3rd to 7th grade I was the kid that kept speaking up at the wrong times, and ended up being the complete laughing stock of the whole school. My 8th grade year was the worst year for me. My only friend went to a different school, and I was stuck with kids that relentlessly teased me for being an outsider. While other kids started to date; I struggled to even get a hi from a person of the opposite gender.

The fact that I would be able to start again for high school was an absolute relief for me. Plus the lack of rules made the deal even sweeter for me. 

The first week of my high school life flew past before I could even look back. I had already made fast friends with a couple of kids, and even managed to talk to a couple of girls. Basic high school life for most kids, but for me this was heaven. 

On the bus ride back around a month into my new school a girl walked up to me. She looked nervous, but still managed to mutter, wanna ride bikes with me later? She was a very normal looking girl. She had brown hair, green eyes, and tight lips, but I had seen her around my neighborhood a couple of times and we got off on the same bus stop. When she saw me nod yes she smiled and walked back to her seat. 

When we got off at our stop she walked right next with me the whole way back to my house. She didnt say a word, but I figured she was just shy. When I got to my house she just told me that she would be over in 1 hour and walked to her house. I went inside and told my mom that I was going to go bike riding with a friend in an hour. She asked me who it was. I told her it was with the girl that lived in our neighborhood and she started to gush about me finding a little girlfriend. I tried to act embarrassed, but I couldnt help but keep on smiling.

I ran into the kitchen and stuffed a couple of snack in a plastic bag and waited on the driveway of our house until I saw her coming from a distance. I hopped on my bike and rode towards her. She gave me a little wave and we rode around the neighborhood a couple of times. After about an hour we stopped riding for a second to take a quick rest and snack break. I took out two granola bars and we munched in silence. After she took finished her bar she turned to me and stuck out a hand before saying, Hey my name is June. I grabbed it and shook it while replying back with, Hey my name is Jay. After the greeting we hopped back on our bikes and rode around until it became dark. We parted ways with a quick hug, but I knew I met someone special.

We spent hours a day together after the bike ride. Sometimes we would go to the library, other times we would go to the Big Lots in the nearby strip mall, and a couple of times we would hang out in her room watching a couple of her favorite movies. Three months into us hanging out she brought up the idea for us to date. I gave her an excited yes but she told me that I had to ask her. I was still nervous. I knew she was going to say yes, but it was my first time and I didnt want to somehow mess it up. I tried asking a couple of times, but the words would not come out. She kept laughing at my attempts, but I could tell she just wanted me to get it over with. Three minutes and over 20 attempts later I managed to blurt out the question and she gave me a yes with a light peck on my lips.

The relationship lasted 5 months. 4 months of the relationship was amazing. 

The last month of the relationship and the month following were the worst days of my life. 

I could tell the relationship was going sour when June started to criticize every small thing I did wrong. If I went to fast on the bike she would yell at me to slow down. If I talked too much she would simply tell me to shut up. Every single day she would get more and more strict about how I acted, and made sure I acted in a way that pleased her. After a couple of days she grew tired of the yelling and proceeded to start hitting. It was never bad hits, but I realized that she would hit me more often when we were alone. 

I started to ignore her, but she still managed to catch up to me no matter how fast I walked after I got off of the bus. 

The day I told her I wanted to break up was the day that everything truly fell to shit for me. She started by knocking on our door at random times. At first she would only come on the afternoons to knock, but after a week she started to knock in the middle of the night. Several times, my mother would have to get up from her sleep and answer the door. I would hear June ask where I was. My mother was patient at first, but after the first couple of times she started to yell at her to leave us alone. 

June still tried to talk to me on the bus on the way to school and the ride back to our house, but I remained silent. 

7 months and 4 days later June was found dead in the entrance to the woods at our school. There were no witnesses or subjects. For the next two weeks they tried to find some type of evidence on Junes body or through the cameras, but nothing was found. Her whole body was suspended in to the air hanging by a rope. Her midsection was sliced opened with some of her intestines touching the ground.

I am 21 now, and Im working at the library that June and I used to visit. Today, for some odd reason, memories of June filled my thoughts. I decided to look through all of the books we claimed as our favorites. I got to the book that she claimed as her favorite book of all time. 

Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck

I rented it out and took it home with me when I got off of work.

When I got home I sat on my couch and read the book. Near the end of the book was a folded piece of paper. I unfolded it and read what was written inside.

Jay, just know that I really do love you. 

I know I yelled at you and hit you, but I was told to.

Dont roll your eyes. I know you are, but Im not just passing off the blame. 

On my way home your mother approached me. She told me that I needed to make you break up with me. She told me that you had a bunch of problems that made it important you were taken care of by your mother. 

I tried to make you break up with me, but you just wouldnt. No matter how mean I acted towards you. You still kept trying to fix things. I know now that there is nothing wrong with you. There was never anything wrong with you.

I tried to talk to you. I came to your house. In the afternoon and at night, but your mother made it very clear that I shouldnt talk to you anymore. That I should just leave you alone. I tried talking to you on the bus, but I know that I just ruined it all for us. I know everyone says young people like us dont know anything about love, but I did. I really did.

Tomorrow Im meeting with a guy. He told me that he would be able to help me find a way to fix everything. He was sent by your mother. He told me that she was sorry for everything and she wanted us to be back together.

I hope when youre reading this note with me, but if youre not. Just read the book one more time. 

Sometimes we have no choice but to fuck up. Its how we are made.

Love,

[June] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TEXT> For the third time this morning I stare at myself in the mirror. I cant help but be disappointed with what I see. What used to be short and spiffy hair is now a reddish-brown mop on top of my head. What used to be eyes full of passion and lips that spit out words with confidence are now full of depression. I used to be fit and lean, but now I see wiry arms and the start of a gut. I hate how I look now, but it is who I have become. I dont want to go outside unless I really have to, and I dont want to exercise anymore. I dont have a need to exercise anymore. 

Five years ago I was honorably discharged from the military. A year after I came back from my tour in Iraq. I have PTSD now, but it wasnt from Iraq. It was from what happened in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. 

I have been too scared to tell anyone, but maybe even one of you guys will know what the fuck these things were. If you dont believe it, I understand. I wouldnt either.

After using up my month of leave I was stationed to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Whenever I had some free time in the first couple of days I took the bus and explored the city of Spring Lake and Fayetteville. The first thing I noticed was that there was almost nothing to do in either city. A couple of fast food restaurants here and there, a movie theater with a cheesy arcade next to it, and an unlimited amount of churches. There was a mall, but the mall barely had any stores that I actually enjoyed looking around. The base actually had more things to do at a much better price. 

The barracks werent necessarily a nice place to live, but it had everything that a normal room would have. Our barrack consisted of two floors, and each floor was equipped with 2 restrooms with 8 showers a piece. I was on the second floor with 19 other soldiers.

Three months passed by in a blur. Whenever I needed any groceries I went to the commissary. If I needed anything else I would go to the PX. If I was bored I would either bowl or watch a movie. Other than that I was mostly lying on my bed and reading a book. It may seem like a dull life, but I actually enjoyed my little routine. I wasnt paid all that well, but housing was provided and my food was dirt cheap. 

I was finally happy and at ease, but all good things come to an end.

On a Saturday evening, I was asleep in my room, but I woke up to the sound of something clicking all around the floor. I turned on the lamp and saw hundreds of little bug like creatures fleeing into several holes in the walls of my room. I hate bugs. I really do, but I dont want to be the guy that filed a report for finding bugs in my room. So I turned the light off and went back to sleep. 

Every night. 

Every fucking night.

I would wake up in the middle of the night and hear those damn bugs crawling all over the floor, but I would just ignore it and continue to sleep. 

With each passing night, however, it became harder to fall back asleep. The sound of their movements kept getting louder and louder. I could hardly sleep now. The other soldiers in the same barrack as me seemed to be suffering from lack of sleep as well. I brought it up to a couple of the other guys while we ate our lunch, but they just told me to ignore it. I tried to argue but quickly realized there was no point. 

I kept silent, and the problem was ignored for 4 months. 

The silence was broken by the sound of screaming and wailing in the middle of the night on a Tuesday. It came from the room next to mine. I jumped out of my bed and ran out the room. I knocked on his door, but the screaming continued. I tried to open it, but it was locked. Other soldiers ran out of their room and tried to help me open the door, but we could not manage to pry the door open before the screaming ceased. Ten minutes later Sgt. Harrison came with a key and opened the door. 

PFC Grant was covered head to toe in those bugs, but they have grown in size since the last time I saw them. Each of them had the length and thickness of my index finger. I ran into the room and tried to slap them away, but they held on to Grants body tightly. I tried to pull them off, but three other soldiers ran into the room and drug me out. I tried to run back in but they pulled me back even harder. I finally gave up and watched the bugs eat Grants lifeless body. 

When they scurried off I finally got a chance to see what he looked like now. I almost threw up, but I swallowed back the disgusting bile and tried my hardest to maintain my composure. His face was halfway eaten off. He had small holes throughout his neck and his body. 

I looked behind me and saw that the remaining 18 soldiers had already started to run out of the building. I took one last look at Grant and ran towards the exit. 

I went down the first set of stairs but stopped immediately when I saw the 18 soldiers standing completely still in front of the doors. Just like Grant they were all completely covered by the bugs. I backed myself up and ran back up the stairs. I rushed into my room and jumped on top of my bed and sat on my bed for hours. I kept the lamp on and stayed awake until the morning. 

As carefully and quietly as I could be I managed to get out of the building. 

That day we lost 42 soldiers in total. 

I know that this may seem like a random story to tell all of you guys, but there is something I have noticed in the past couple of months. 

In the movies, tv shows, music videos, news, and everywhere I go, I see those [tiny black creatures] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> The Story Behind My 8 Scars </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-15 09:50:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There is a total of eight scars on my body. Two scars are on my face, three are on my back, two scars on my chest, and the last scar is across the knuckles of my right hand.

I never felt comfortable about talking about how I got any of my scars. There has only been one person in the world I decided to tell about my scars until now. That person is my wife. She has asked me several times while we were dating, but I always told her I would just tell her later when I felt more comfortable. I know it bothered her, but I didnt want to scare her away. Today is the day I finally feel brave enough. I decided to tell my wife and then tell you all because I feel like it may contain some important lessons.

As you know yesterday was Valentines Day. I brought home a letter that I wrote for her with the story of my scars and a heart-shaped box of chocolate. She went to grab for her gifts but I told her to meet me in the bedroom. She followed me in and we sat on our bed. I handed her the letter first. 

This is what I wrote.

Today is Valentines Day and I want to let you know that I love you. Im sorry I have kept this a secret for so long, but please do not be afraid of me after you read this.

Ironically, I received the first scar on Valentines Day. I was seven years old and I accidentally broke the tv my father had just bought. He walked up to me and started yelling at me. I tried to tell him it was an accident, but he refused to listen to a word I had to say. He didnt realize it, but he was holding a small pocket knife in his hand while yelling at me. I closed my eyes while I started to cry, but a pain erupted from the middle of my chest. I opened my eyes and started to scream in pain. I blacked out and woke up on my bed. I had three stitches in my chest and my father was sitting next to my bed. He rubbed my shoulder and told me I was fine. 

When I was 11 years old I came home from school and my parents were in the middle of an argument. I tried to sneak past them, but as I was walking past the entrance to the kitchen I feel something hard smash on my back. I tried to keep walking, but with each step, I could feel glass pieces digging and ripping into my skin and flesh. I heard a gasp coming from the kitchen before I blacked out once again. I woke up in the middle of the night. I was leaned over to my right side, and my father was standing in the corner of the room. When he saw me wake up he put a finger up to his mouth and stood there for a couple of hours. I tried to go back to sleep, but I was afraid of what my father would do to me. 

When I was between the ages of 11 to 14 I had trouble sleeping. I tried to still keep my eyes closed because whenever I opened my eyes I would see my father standing off in the corner of my room staring right at me. I was scared for my life. I tried everything to stay asleep, but it was impossible. I hated my dad, and I just wished that he would go away forever. 

The next couple of years I tried to avoid my father as much as I could. I did a pretty good job until I was 14 years old. It all started on a Friday. I got off of the bus and walked to my house. When I got close I saw my father standing in the middle of our lawn. I tried to walk past him, but he jumped in front of me. With a gruff voice, he said, Dont come in here. Just go. We dont have time to deal with you anymore. I tried to run past him and call out for my mom but my father threw me down on the ground. I looked up at my dad, but he threw some money at me and walked back into the house. I honestly didnt know what to do. My face was bleeding and I didnt want to go anywhere else. I ran to the back of the house and into the shed in our backyard. I stayed there for two days. I didnt leave except the few times I would run to the water hose to drink some water. On Sunday I became desperate. I was hungry and I wanted to be back in my home and sleep in my room. I didnt care if my dad hit me again. My father answered the door and pointed at my room. I ran upstairs and dove under my covers. A couple of hours later my father came into my room with a plate of food. I ate every last bite of the food and placed the plate on the side table. 

I thought about reading a book, but I didnt have the strength to get up from my bed. For a little over an hour, I imagined myself being in a much better family. A family where everyone loved each other and the parents didnt spend the whole time arguing. That is all I ever hoped for, but even at that young age, I knew it was not possible. 

I dont know when I fell asleep, but I woke up and screamed in pain. My chest felt like it was on fire. I tried to get up but something pushed me onto my stomach and held my head down. It became hard to breathe and I started to struggle even harder before I felt something hit the side of my head and the world went blank. When I woke back up again it was still dark. I looked to my left and right but didnt see anyone. I slowly rolled back onto my back and saw my father standing in the doorway. He had a knife in his hands and kept both of his eyes on me. 

I started to shout for my mother, but my dad ran up to me and put his hand over my mouth. I settled down and stared at him. When he took his hand off of my mouth I remained quiet. He still had the knife in his hands and the last thing I wanted to do was make him angry again.

Now you know why I have the 7 scars. 

The eighth scar came from the day of my graduation. Neither my mother nor my father showed up. I wasnt sad, though. I didnt care. I was just glad I was off to college in a couple of months. It was a great day for me. After the graduation, I went with a couple of buddies and went to a party. It was the first party I went to and the first time I drank alcohol. I didnt drink too much, but I still felt happier than I have ever felt in my whole life.

The fun stopped when I got home. 

The first thing I noticed was the blood all over our white couch in our living room. Next thing I noticed was my father lying face down beside the couch. I walked over to him and saw blood all around his chest and midsection area. I turned him around and saw that he had been shot 3 times in his midsection. I was about to lay him back down when his eyes opened and his lips started moving. 

Despite the shots he took, he still managed to have the longest conversation I have ever had with him.

Father: s-s-ave you

Me: What do you mean?

Father: your m-mom didnt want you. I love her and y-you. I wanted it to w-work.

Me: Youre the one that didnt want me. You didnt care about me.

Father: N-no please remember

He took his last breath and never moved another muscle. 

I sat on the ground next to him and tried to think of what he said. Why he would even say anything like that about my mother, and then the memories hit me. My father holding the knife and yelling at me when I was 7; He didnt stab me. My mother bumped into him while he was yelling at me. 

When I was 11 she was the one that threw the dish at my back. It wasnt an accident. I dont remember what they were arguing about, but he was just watching over me at night so that my mother wouldnt come in. He stayed there every night so that my mother wouldnt come in and try to do anything.

At 14 he had it. He didnt want to leave my mother. He loved her. He really did. He loved me too, but he just couldnt handle the stress and torture he put himself through. That was the only time he hit me. 

I heard my mother coming downstairs. She gave me a smile when she saw me and walked towards me with the gun still in her right hand. 

Before she could do anything I jumped on top of her and punched her in the stupid face for every single scar, for taking the life of the only parent that loved me, for making me hate my father, and for still being able to smile through it all. I dont know which bone on her face cut through the skin on my knuckles, but I know one thing it is the only scar I can appreciate.

When the cops came they asked me question after question. I answered all of them honestly. I was not charged. It was all self-defense. 

That is how I got my 8 scars. I want you to promise me one thing. To still love me the same way you have always loved me. Please dont think of me as an evil person. I love you and I will always love you. 

Forever Your Valentine, 

subject8631

My wife looked at me with eyes full of love, and I knew I didnt mess up by letting her know.

I just wanted to share this with you guys, because we tend to forget who cares for us and who is trying to kill us. Please be careful with whom you [trust] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TEXT> and you're acting like a whiny brat. It's not hilarious. Just a bit sad to be quite honest. I'm sorry you have the need to rant about a type of story or a couple of sentences from a story to write a post about it on the ooc. 

Incorrect. NoSleepWorkshop is for single stories. Not NoSleep as a whole...

If my comments stop any other reader from bashing and ranting and whining about a certain group of stories and decide to just move on to another story they actually enjoy I have done a much better job improving NoSleep. </TEXT>

I don't complain about other stories because i spend a fair amount of time to write my stories, and i know other people do the same. They just have a different method of writing. 

It's just the ooc is here to make NoSleep better. Not whine about a general group of stories that will never go away. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Pheromone Spray was Deleted so here you go! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-14 04:07:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know by the time everyone is done reading the next sentence most of you guys will be shaking your heads and calling me an idiot. I bought one of those pheromone colognes online. I never really believed in any of that, but for some odd reason, this one just seemed to make complete sense to me. Plus at only seven dollars a bottle I figured the worst case scenario is losing out on seven dollars. It was called Lust Enhancer and in 5 days it would be in my mailbox.

Im not going to lie. For the next 5 days, I checked the mailbox to see if it happened to come in early but walked back into my house with a slight feeling of sadness. I just really wanted more people to pay attention to me. As a bisexual male that never got the attention of either gender I wanted, no needed, something to help me obtain some sort of romance. Im 29 years old and I havent even gone on a date before. I havent had my first kiss before. I sucked a dick back in college, but the guy never called me back or even acknowledged my presence after that.

Yesterday evening when I came back from work I checked my mailbox and found a small brown box inside. I grabbed the box and ran back inside of my house. I excitedly tore open the box and a piece of paper fell out. On the top it said Instructions and right below it was only one simple sentence.

One spray every 3 days.

I took the small bottle out of the box and looked it over. Inside of the bottle was a thicker clear liquid. Whenever I moved the bottle the liquid slowly moved towards whatever direction the bottle was at. I set it down on the table and watched the liquid slowly settle back down. I wondered how it would come out of the bottle so I uncapped it and sprayed myself in the neck.

When the liquid hit me in the neck I let out a loud gasp. It felt like water hitting my neck, but I could feel the liquid moving. I dont really know how to explain it any better other than that it felt like the liquid dug into my pores. I tried to rub out whatever was left, but my neck was completely dry. I could feel myself start to panic so I took a couple of deep breaths and started to rationalize with myself. Im just tired. Cologne does tend to dry up as soon as it touches any type of skin. The liquid was not moving. Maybe it was just running a little bit because I sprayed so close to my neck.

After I managed to calm myself down I ordered a pizza. I was hungry and curious now. Whoever came up to the door will definitely be affected by the cologne if it is real.

40 minutes later someone rang my doorbell. A 30 something-year-old guy was standing outside with a pizza in his hands. I walked up closer to him and asked him what the total was. With a look of confusion on his face, he told me that it would be $14.19. I asked him if there was anything else I could pay him with, and to my excitement, his face started to go from confused to somewhat turned on. I grabbed him by his arm and pulled him inside.
I wont go into details, but I got a free pizza. He was a biter which I liked, but at times he bit a little too hard. I didnt care. I loved it. I woke up this morning to see another person lying next to me for the first time. I gave him a little kiss on the cheek and he woke up. I asked him if he wanted breakfast and he nodded his head. While I was in the kitchen making some eggs and bacon he walked into the kitchen and told me that he was fired last night. He also told me that this was his first time ever doing anything with another guy. I laughed and told him to sit down.
After breakfast, he started to look a little distant. He kept being short whenever I asked him a question, and by 2 pm he snuck out of my house while I used the restroom.

It didnt really make me sad, though. I mean there are plenty other people around where I live. Take, for example, the lovely brunette that lives 3 doors down. I had a crush on her for the past 2 years, but I never had the courage to even talk to her.

That is when I messed up. I grabbed the bottle of cologne and sprayed my neck two more times. It felt like the liquid went inside of my pores again, but this time I was fine with it. I walked over to her house and knocked on her door. When she opened her door she looked at me for a second and asked me if I lived a couple houses down from her. I laughed and told her that I did and that my vacuum cleaner just broke down. She gave me a little laugh and told me that she would go get hers for me.

I was overflowing with confidence that moment. Without a second thought, I took off my shoes and walked into her house. I walked up to the little hallway she walked into and saw that she was pulling the vacuum out of a small closet. I walked up to her and hugged her from behind. She jumped up in surprise and shoved me off, but after a couple of seconds, she noticed my smell. She walked back up to me and slowly licked my cheek before I blacked out.

It was nighttime when I regained consciousness. Pain erupted from all over my face. I got up from the bed and walked out the bedroom door. The girl was lying on the ground snoring. Her mouth was covered in blood. I bolted out of her house and ran back home. My cell phone was charging on my living room sofa next to the bottle of cologne. I grabbed the phone and dialed 911. I saw my face from the front facing camera on my phone. Most of my face has been torn off. There are bite marks around each gash on my face. There is almost nothing covering the bottom of my right eye. My cheeks are pretty much gone.

Im in the hospital now.

The doctors asked me if I remembered anything, but I remained silent. I cant blame her for this. I can only blame myself. Im here to give you all a warning. If you find a pheromone spray called Lust Enhancer get it.
It really works, but please only spray once. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Wife Is Taking Care Of A Baby Doll More Than Our Daughter </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-12 09:02:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From the day my daughter was born I could tell that she was something special. We named her Zooey and she was the smartest baby I have ever seen. Every single month I loved my special little girl more and more, but for some odd reason my wife distanced herself away from Zooey every single month. By the 6th month my wife barely even gave Zooey a glance. I could tell it made Zooey sad, but I didnt really want to bring it up. I just wanted my daughter to know that I loved her very much.

Zooey said her first word when she was 3 months old. 

Daddy. 

She never really said Mommy or even Mom, but my wife never seemed to mind. If anything she finally looked to be in a much better mood. 

By the time she was 6 months Zooey started to walk. She would still fall sometimes, but I was completely blown away by how strong willed her young mind was. Instead of crying whenever she fell she would just pick herself back up and continue trying.

On Zooeys first birthday my wife was busy with work so I shared a very special day with my daughter. I got her a chocolate cake for her to smash and devour. She didnt touch it, but she looked perfectly happy with staring at the cake with a look of wonder on her face. We spent the rest of the day playing with her presents until it was her bedtime. My wife didnt come home until 10 pm. I asked her where she was, but she just put her hand up to my face and walked past me and into our bedroom. 

I sighed and watched tv until I fell asleep on the couch. I woke up to the sounds of my wife and Zooey talking. My wife was trying to get her to say Mommy, but Zooey kept clapping her hands while saying Daddy! with a wide smile on her face. That was the last time my wife tried talking to Zooey. 

On the day of Zooeys 2nd birthday my wife told me she was going to stay later at work. I tried begging and reasoning with her to stay, but she just told me it wasnt worth it. I heard sniffles from behind me when my wife left the house. I turned around to see a tear stricken Zooey staring out the door. She asked me if mommy didnt love her, but I just hugged her and told her that we both loved her very much. After I pulled away from the hug Zooey asked me, Why doesnt she talk to me? I told her that mommy was just stressed, and to not let it bug her. I got her another cake, but she told me that she didnt like to eat cake. She thought it was too pretty to destroy.

With a nod I left the cake on the dining room table and took out three brightly colored bags from under the table. We have this tradition where I take out the presents for her and rip the paper as carefully as possible. She liked using the wrapping paper as little decorations for her room. The first two presents were just little bow sets and a couple of new books. The third present was one of those baby dolls you can feed and change. She was really excited about the doll. She played with it in the living room by herself until it was time for bed. 

My wife came back home at 11pm completely drunk. She looked like she was crying, but I was far too tired to even acknowledge that she was there. She did it all of the time to Zooey and now me. Our marriage was falling apart and I really didnt know how to fix it. I thought she was just going to go into the bedroom, but she walked into the middle of the living room and picked up Zooeys new doll. After a couple of seconds she started to hug the doll and rock it back and forth. The bottle and the 3 toy diapers were lying next to it and my wife picked those up as well. She put the bottle up to the baby and started whispering to it. 

I was completely at awe at the sight of my wife showing the baby doll more attention than she ever gave Zooey. She sat down on the couch with the doll and took the bottle out of its mouth and continued to whisper to it. The whispering overwhelmed me with curiosity so I snuck up behind her and tried to listen to what she was saying. It was hard at first, but after a couple of seconds I noticed she was saying the same thing over and over again. Please call me mommy.

After a couple of minutes my wife fell asleep with the toy baby on top of her stomach. I walked into the bedroom and grabbed a blanket for her. After I got her settled in I went back into the bedroom and fell asleep. This morning I woke up to the sound of my wife laughing for the first time in several years. I rushed downstairs to see what the source of her laughter was. When I walked into the kitchen I saw my wife twirling around in circles with the toy baby. Zooey was sitting down with tears falling down her cheeks. I picked up Zooey and asked my wife what she was doing. Each time she spun around she said one word at a time. 

Just

Playing

With

My

Daughter

I told her that Zooey was crying, but my wife just shrugged and kept spinning around with the baby.

This annoyed me quite a bit, but I just took Zooey back into the living room and played with a couple of her older dolls with her. After about an hour later my sweating wife came out of the kitchen and said that she was going to the mall with her daughter. Zooey got up quickly and rushed into her room to change. By the time Zooey came out changed into her outside clothes my wife and the doll were already gone. 

Zooeys bed time rolled around and I put her to bed. While I put her covers over her she asked me, Does momma really love me? I nodded my head at her and smiled. I just told her that momma wanted to surprise her with some new clothes. Zooey fell asleep a couple of minutes later with a tiny smile on her face.

Tonight my wife came home around 9 pm. I walked up to her and asked what was wrong with her. She tried to ignore me, but I kept blocking her way until she stopped and glared at me. She shoved the baby doll in my face and shouted, Shes at least fucking real! Do you know how hard it is to play fucking pretend with you? Zooey is dead. Shes been dead. When are you going to stop playing this stupid game? 

I shouted back at her to stop lying, but my wife just fell into my arms and started sobbing. Zooey came downstairs and stared at us hugging. She gave me a smile and walked back upstairs. I started to sob with my wife as memories started to flood in. Our beautiful daughter died 10 days after we brought her home from the hospital. There was nothing wrong with her. She just fell into a deep sleep she never woke up from. The doctors told us that it was SIDS, but I just never wanted to believe it.

After my wife finally settled down I sat her on the couch and walked upstairs. I walked into Zooeys room and saw all of the little wrapping paper from her presents taped on the walls. The toys I got for her were there and the new bed I bought for her just 2 months ago was there, but Zooey was nowhere to be found. 

With a heavy sigh I closed the door to her bedroom and walked into my room. I looked through all of the photos on my laptop that I thought I took with Zooey, but it was just me taking photos of myself.

I was about to close my laptop down, but I decided to reach out to you guys. I am now in the grieving process. My wife was acting crazy, but I was the crazy one all along. My baby is gone, and I just wish I could experience just [one last day with her] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TEXT> Right? I appreciate a story that manages to scare me now. 

Kinda like alcohol. 

Nothing better than brewing your own beer.

Then you realize that normal beer doesn't really get you buzzed anymore. 

Sometimes you'll come across a better beer and shocks the hell out of you. You learn from it and make your beer better.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now let me tell you. I know that New York City and Los Angeles are gigantic cities, but it is nowhere as confusing as Seoul, South Korea. I have been here at least 3 times in the past 6 months, but I have yet to figure where anything is, but I still decided to stupidly walk around without my cell phone at 2 in the morning. 

It was in the middle of a conference and I just couldnt go to sleep. So I grabbed a coat and walked out of my hotel room. There really wasnt anything going on inside of the hotel. The bar was closed, and the computer room was locked. The swimming pool and gym closed at 10 pm so I made the dumb decision to walk around outside. 

I tried to keep track of which street I took, but after walking around for 20 minutes I quickly forgot where I was. Taxis are all around this city at any time. So catching a cab and getting back to the hotel would not be a problem. 

After a couple more minutes of walking I noticed that the huge buildings started to disappear, and the sounds of cars became extinct. This was absolutely perfect for me. I found a little convenience store and grabbed a couple of beers and walked down the street hoping to find a park of some sort. 

The lady in the front counter greeted me when I walked in, but I noticed how old the store looked. I looked at her and saw that she was a fairly short woman maybe in her early 20s. I know it doesnt seem important, but to me it felt strange that a young woman like her would work in a rundown store like this. I pushed the thoughts out of my head and grabbed 2 bottles of Soju. (The most popular Korean alcohol beverage and only around a dollar)

I paid for my drinks and walked out of the store. Something about this location made the weather feel just right. Usually its completely cold in the middle of February, but it felt so nice out I could take my coat off. This was definitely the most comfortable couple of hours of my life. The fact that there were far less people here than the rest of Seoul made it just that much better. 

While I was walking down the street while sipping on the Soju I looked around and noticed that there were almost no buildings around me. There was just a park in the distance and 3 other smaller buildings including the convenience store. I also noticed that I was walking up to the park without even noticing, but it did seem like a really nice place to drink the rest of my drink so I kept going. 

On the way there I finished off the first drink so I placed the empty bottle in my pocket. I took a little rest to catch my breath and open the next bottle. After my mini break I looked back up and noticed that the park seemed to be farther away. I rubbed my eyes, but the park still seemed to be farther away. For a second I thought about turning back around and catching a cab, but I decided against it. Already halfway there; what was the point in giving up with a full bottle of Soju anyways? 

This time I focused on the park while I walked towards it; only taking my eyes off of it occasionally to take another drink. I started to slowly calm down when I noticed I was definitely getting close. Around 50 paces away from the park I tripped on something and fell to the ground. Right as I was falling down I know for a fact I heard someone whispering to me. It was in Korean, but I will try my hardest to translate it. Come in. Come in. Its fun. You wont regret. I got up and looked around, but the only thing that was there was what tripped me. It was an empty bottle of beer. 

I picked it up to chuck it into the grass when I noticed how old it felt. I could make out the word Jinro Brewing on the bottle. I turned the bottle around to see if I could read anything else on it. My eyes finally fell on a series of numbers. 

*19531011*

I dont know why it was the beer bottle that made me run away from the park. I dont know why I didnt run away when I heard the whispers, but I just wish I never even went out of my hotel room. I bolted down the street and towards the convenience store, but every couple of steps I kept hearing the park call back to me. Dont run. So we can play. Come in here. Forever you can stay. I ignored the calling, but I will tell you that every time it called out to me I was just that much more tempted to just go back to the park. 

Just look back once and it will stop. Against my will I stopped completely and looked back. The park was gone, but a group of children were running around the empty lot. A man carrying a beer bottle was walking down the street towards the park. He took out a knife from his back pocket and threw the bottle on the ground. 

The kids stopped playing and looked at the man with curiosity. Without slowing down he walked up to the first kid and raised the knife up, but before he could even stab a kid the other children swarmed around him and each took out a knife.  A couple stabbed at his legs, a few jumped on him and the rest just stepped back and watched while laughing. The mans blood was flying all over the lot. I couldnt watch any longer so I turned around and continued to run to the convenience store. 

I kept running away from the park and from the laughter coming from the children. Right when I got near the convenience store the noise stopped. I turned around and the park was back there again. 

When I got up to the store I tried opening the doors but it was locked. I tried shaking the doors harder hoping it was jammed but the door wouldnt give.  Desperation started to take over my body, but I ignored it and started to walk away. That is when the door rattled from the other side. I walked back up to the door, and saw the lady that checked me out. I started to point to the door but she shook her head slowly at me. Bits of her skin started falling off of her face every time she moved her face. She said, Go to the park. You can stay forever. You can never die. Stay at the park. You will be happy.

I screamed and banged the door where her face was and kept running away from the park. I started to see familiar buildings and started to calm down. After a couple of minutes I started to walk. The streets of a busy Seoul started to come into view. I got on my knees and thanked the world for saving my life. I took out the second bottle of Soju and took a long chug of it. I finished the bottle off and threw the bottle in the grass and looked up. 

I was back in the park. 

The kids started to come out of the shadows and slowly walked up to me. I frantically looked around. Hoping there was some sort of place of shelter. My eyes fell on a older phone booth. 

I forced myself onto my feet and ran inside of the phone booth and picked up the phone. After muttering a quick prayer I put the phone up to my ear. The relief I felt when I heard the dial tone is beyond words. With tears falling from my eyes I put 500 won (50 cents) and called for a taxi. I thought about calling the cops for a second, but I knew there was zero chance in hell they would believe my story. The dispatcher answered my call and I told her that I needed a ride from a park close to Ibis Hotel. She asked me where the park was exactly but all I could do was describe out what the park looked like and what the stores around it looked like. She muttered silently for a second and said that a taxi was on its way. 

By the time I hung up the phone the kids had surrounded around the phone booth. They started to bang all around me, but I sat down as low as I could and put my feet up against the doors. A girl with long flowing brown hair walked up to me and stared me down with a smile on her face. Her body started to bubble around her midsection and legs. Her face started to stretch out until the woman from the convenience store was staring me down. She started chanting with the kids, Open the door. Live forever. Just open the door. Escape the terror. 

A couple of the kids started to jam their knives into the door and pry it open. I kept my legs in the same spot. Waves of pain overcame my body whenever they stabbed my feet, but I held on. I didnt want to die. I didnt care about my feet. I just wanted to live. I just wanted to be at the hotel. I wanted to go back home.

When my legs started to give out I heard a honk in the distance. I looked to my right and saw a taxi. I got to my feet and braced myself to be attacked by the children, but I was only met by the sound of impatient honking. I opened my eyes to see that the kids and the women disappeared. The park looked to be ages older. I opened the door and dead bolted to the taxi and got in the back. 

The taxi driver took one look at me and asked me where I was headed. I muttered Ibis Hotel and he drove off. On the way there the taxi driver kept giving me an odd look. 

I asked him why he was staring, but he just shrugged his shoulders and kept driving till we arrived at my hotel. I opened the door and started to head out when he grabbed me by my shoulder. He whispered to me, Every couple of weeks we get a call over there. Thats why we knew where you were. Avoid the park at all costs. It is still haunted by the ghosts of children that are responsible for 12 deaths in their town. Many men tried to stop them, but they were unsuccessful. Now they stay at the park and prey upon people that foolishly go near the park. You are lucky. You survived. Keep it that way.

Im at my hotel now. I wanted to give you this warning. 

If you happen to be in Korea and you find yourself in Seoul.  

Please only stay in areas that are heavily populated. 

I leave you this final warning before I head out to the park. I cant stop thinking about all of them. I want to live forever. I want to know what true happiness is. 

[Good Bye] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TEXT> Its over. I won, but satisfaction is the last thing I feel. 

Everything is over. I dont know how I can describe everything that has happened, but I will try. 

We didnt get any type of breakfast this morning. D just walked in and told us to get up. We followed him out and went to the boat. I got on last and took my seat next to D once more. He put his arm around me gave me a half hug. He put his yellow and black teeth close to my ear and whispered, Smile. It suits you better. Youll probably die today, but just make the last couple of hours the best possible baby. He chuckled and stared into the water. 

After a couple of minutes we stopped in front of a door. A drawing of a family gorging out of a meal was scratched into the wooden door. We all got off the boat and walked into the door when D opened it. Inside of the room was a massive feast laid out on 10 huge tables. I was walking up to one of the tables to grab a plateful of mashed potatoes and gravy when D cleared his throat. We all turned to him and he walked up to a dish piled high with steaks. He grabbed a steak and took a bite. He turned to all of us and with a mouthful of red meat he said, You take a bite of anything in here. You die. Simple. It seems like an easy feat doesnt it? I mean you just have to block the food out from your mind right? 

He snapped his fingers and 10 men stepped into the room. All of them looked severely malnourished. Their ribs were poking out of their torn up shirts and their legs looked like they could barely support the meager weight of their bodies. Each of them walked up to a table and started to shovel food into their mouths. My mouth started to water, but I managed to block out what was going on around me. I turned my back to the tables and closed my eyes. I didnt look around until I heard the sound of a bell. I quickly glanced around to see that no one took the bait. Alex and Kristy were standing together in a huddle, Jeremy and Andreas was talking to each other as loud as they could to distract themselves, and Jeremiah was cowering in the far left corner of the room.

The 10 men stopped eating as soon as the bell rang and stared at the food with their hungry eyes. 

Silence filled the room for the next 2 minutes. 120 seconds that I counted in my head.

The bell rang twice and the men grabbed two handfuls of food and started to walk towards us. I tried to run away, but they moved surprisingly fast. 2 men tackled me to the ground and started to hover the food over my nose.  They started to whisper about how I wish I could have the food. About how easy it would be for me to just take a bite. My mouth started to water, but I managed to resist eating out of their hands. This lasted for what seemed like forever. It only stopped when the sound of loud sobbing filled the room. The men got off me and I looked around the room.

Jeremiah was sobbing into the food that was now in his hands with small bits of meat falling from his mouth. He threw the food on the ground, but I already knew it was far too late. 

D walked in and pulled Jeremiah to his feet. After Jeremiah recomposed himself D told us to follow him. No one moved a muscle. We knew what was going to happen, but we wanted to allow Jeremiah to live as long as possible. D took out a gun from his shirt and shot Alex in the right knee. Kristy erupted into screams and Alex collapsed onto the ground and started groaning in pain.  

D then shouted at us, This is not a game. This is just what you all deserve. I am only getting rid of the bad from the world. When I say walk. You fucking walk. When I say come with me. You follow me. Do you understand or do I have to kill one of you? I want to give you a chance, but if it isnt possible I will just kill all of you and start with a fresh group. Believe me. I have plenty of people to use. Criminals around the world. Kids who are sold to us by their parents. Even kids that we get money for to get rid of. Youre not important to me. I can kill you right now. So get the fuck up and follow me.

Kristy helped Alex to his feet and started to follow D first. The rest of us quickly followed behind. Jeremiah was still sobbing while being dragged by D. We walked out of the door and saw D walking down a stairway next to the door. It wasnt there before, but I didnt have the strength or desire to question it. Kristy put Alex on her back and carried him down. 

It was dark the whole entire way down. I tried to feel around with my feet for the next step and slowly reached the end of the stairway. I heard a click and the room erupted with red light. Jeremiah was lying on the ground begging D for mercy, but D was laughing while he grabbed the knife from the back of his pants. He started to rub the sword on Jeremiahs neck and asked, Why do you deserve mercy? You failed. Jeremiah started to beg once more, but before he even muttered out the third word his head rolled away from his body.

D looked at us and said, I have a deal for you guys. He threw the knife in the middle of us and pulled out a gun. Whoever can grab the knife on my count and kill any one of you guys. You will be able to leave with a check for 150k. You wont know where you were so my men will transport you to the closest airport. Blindfolded, of course, but you will have more than enough money to completely forget what you went through. Okay.

He clapped his hands and giggled with excitement.

One.

Two.

Go!

Andreas was the first to grab the knife and tried to stab Alex. Kristy ran up behind Andreas and ripped the knife out of his hands. With both of her hands she plunged the knife into the exposed midsection of Andreas. He tried to rip the knife out of his body but Kristy took the knife back out and stabbed him through the chest. 

D clapped his hands and exclaimed, Oh Im proud of you, but one more offer. You kill Alex and I will raise up the money to 500 million dollars. With a smile he pointed at the knife in her hand and whispered 500 million dollars. Kristy looked down at Alex and started to rub his face. Alex kept muttering, Babe, I know you wont do it. Just please dont do it. You know I love you. I would never do it to you. She looked up at D and shook her head no, and I saw Alex sigh in relief. Kristy looked back up at D with a smile and with a scream turned back around and stabbed Alex in the neck. 

Alex lied on the ground for minutes before we could be certain he was dead. Once his body stopped moving D walked up to Kristy and patted her on the back. She started to ask for the check, but D stopped her short with a bullet in her head. Her body crumpled to the ground while D let out a huge laugh. People always forget about greed! They think its over! He started to jump up and down with excitement when the gun flew out of his hands and on the ground.  I grabbed the gun and without a second thought shot out all 11 bullets that remained in the magazine. 

Jeremy had three bullets in his head and D was lying on the ground face down. I walked over to him and rolled him over. His face took two bullets and his chest had been shot several times. 

He looked at me and muttered. I knew you were going to win. I just had to push you is all. Dont think of me as the enemy. Just as your mentor. You have two choices. Walk away from all of this or take what I have created. My whole life was dedicated to rid of the filth in the world. It has become far more than I can handle.

He died seconds later. 

It is now 4 hours since D died. I have decided to stay and continue what he has started. We have a house were we train young men to become part of this great organization. They come from parents either selling us their kids or from parents that actually give us money to get rid of their kids. 

Sometimes we send kids back home. Just so that we can properly locate where there shitty parents are.

We send people out using a wonderful app D has created. 

This app has produced more members for us as well as saved our members and future members lives. It has made us much more productive and efficient. 

I now control an app called [Life is Beta.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TEXT> [Part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5sk87k/out_of_9_people_only_1_will_get_to_live_part_1/)

I woke up to something softly scratching my face. When I opened my eyes I saw D rubbing his fingers on my cheek. I jerked away, but D managed to keep his finger at the same spot on my face and continued to rub. I tried to get up, but D told me to lay back down and relax. He smiled and kissed me on my cheek. I tried to get up again but he pressed my ear up to his mouth and whispered, I dont want you to die. Well not yet at least. Everything you see in the Lust circle will want you to dive into sexual activities. They will want you to fail so that you can die, but remember my face. Remember my kiss, and use it to keep you away from failing. I have a much better plan with you.

He walked out and closed the door. For the next couple of minutes I sat in the darkness. The sound of snoring surrounded me, but it was somewhat soothing for me to hear. It made me feel like I was back at home. The illusion was shattered when D burst through the door and turned on the lights. Seven other groggy people started to sit up. D snapped his fingers and three people walked into the door. They had a leopard, lion, and a wolf mask on. They carried in huge dishes filled with bacon, eggs, and toast. We started to walk up to the people, but they put their hands up and dumped all of the food on the ground and left with the plates.

D laughed and said, Well dont just stand there. Im sure youre hungry. You have 10 minutes and then we will go to the first circle. I started grabbing bacon and toast that were on the top and shoveled the food in my mouth. The rest started to pick up pieces of bacon and a little bit of eggs. Malcolm was last to grab the food and was left with the rest of the eggs.

D clapped his hands and told us it had been 10 minutes. He motioned with his hand for us to stand up and all of us except Malcolm stood up. He was grabbing at his stomach and wincing in pain. I walked over to him and helped him to his feet. I asked him if he was alright; he nodded and pulled away from me. D started walking out of the room and we followed him. 

After about 2 to 3 minutes of walking D opened a door to our right and walked up to a boat floating on a narrow but long pool. The pool seemed to be never-ending. It stretched down far past where my eyes could see. We all climbed in and took a seat. When I looked around to find a seat D tapped on the seat next to him. I took the seat and D pointed into the water. He whispered, Its red right now because we have colored it that way, but one day it will be filled with blood. He turned around and stood up. With a grin on his face he said, When we are on the boat you do not call me D. If you call me D I will throw you off the boat and watch you drown. Call me Charon. I am here to transport you to the lust circle and the rest of the circles as well. When I get off of the boat you can call me D. Hell, you can even call me Dom. Understood?

We all muttered yes and he pointed forward. The boat started to move on its own and turned left or right with a flick of Ds wrists. After a boat ride that lasted for less than 10 minutes D pointed down and the boat came to a stop in front of a door. He turned to look at all of us and giggled. With excitement flowing through every word he exclaimed, This is the first circle guys! Hop off the boat. I told you last night, but Ill tell you again. Dont fall for temptation. You show lust in your actions I will make sure you die. Dont grab anything that isnt yours. Ready? Ok. Lets go! He hopped off the boat and we followed him to the door. He opened it up and motioned us to go in.

The walls, floor, and ceiling were all a solid black. There were around 10 cameras all around the room. I was confused about what the challenge was but walked into the room. Alex and Kristy went to the opposite corners trying to avoid each other at all costs. Andreas, Malcolm, and Jeremiah stood in the middle. Gus and Jeremy stood near the doorway. I walked up to Andreas, Malcolm, and Jeremiah and stood with them. Malcolm was telling Jeremiah that he had a sore stomach, but Jeremiah just put up his hand and told him to stay completely still. I looked at Malcolm and saw that he had started to sweat. His pupils were triple the size as normal, and his breath was starting to get deep and long. 

A bell rang from outside and around 50 people started to pour into the room. The lights turned off and a soft single light took its place. A deep base filled the room and slowly progressed into a wonderful song that brought out every molecule of sexual desire out of me. They surrounded us and started to rub all over our bodies. I tried to get away from them, but fell into another group. The bell rang once more and they stripped themselves naked. While they were taking their clothes off I ran to the far right corner of the room and crouched down as low as I could. I looked around the room and saw that everyone else was trying to avoid being touched. 

Everyone except Malcolm. 

Malcolm was in the process of grinding against a woman. A naked man walked up behind him and started to kiss him on the neck. A loud groan came out of Malcolm and the bell rang once more. The two people immediately stepped away from Malcolm and stared him down. 

D opened the door and threw a duffel bag into the room. Gus ran towards the bag but the other people blocked his way and the rest opened the bag and they each took out a knife. Malcolm was oblivious to it all. He was still dancing along to the low alluring bass as the people gathered around him. Right as Malcolm opened his eyes they jumped on top of him and he became invisible. Within 10 seconds they got up and 8 people ran out of the room carrying the remains of his body. 

Before they got out of the door Gus took a good look at what Malcolm looked like. When they exited the door he looked up at us with a smile on his face. 

I got up and started to walk out the door, but the bell rang again and the people started surrounding us once more. 

This time they started whispering to us. A couple of women walked up to me and started to tell me everything they loved about my body. They talked about all of the nasty shit they would do to me. Every time I felt any type of urge my mind automatically bounced to how it felt having D rub his finger on my cheek. That is what saved my life. After a while of failing to seduce me they started to put their knives all around my body. One woman put her knife on my neck and whispered, Ill kill you right now if you dont fuck me right now. I tried to think of a response, but I didnt need to. 

The bell rang once more and I looked around the room.

Gus was covered in Malcolms blood with desire flowing from his eyes. He was halfway out of his pants when he noticed everyone staring at him. He started to scream, No, No, Ple-. 

They were on him like they were on Malcolm. I looked away from the scene until I heard Ds voice.

Good job everyone. This concludes today.

We took the boat back and we are back in Limbo. 

They gave us spaghetti and bread for dinner but no one had much of an appetite.

Today is over.

<TITLE> Out of 9 People Only 1 Will Get To Live [Part 1] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-07 09:15:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As a rough hand ripped away the blindfold off of my face I looked around only to be met with complete darkness. Quiet whispers of prayers and begging came from all around me, but I couldnt see who or what was making those noises. After a couple of seconds I heard a pair of footsteps walk across the room and suddenly light flooded into the room.

Pain automatically erupted from my eyes and I instantly shut my eyes. I held them shut until I felt a hand rub my shoulder. I opened my eyes to see an incredibly pale faced man staring right at me. He was maybe an inch away from me while he kept rubbing my shoulder and breathing into my face. When he took his hand off my shoulder he gave me a smile. His teeth were a deep yellow with black specks all around the edges of each tooth.

He took a couple of steps back and I looked around the room. With me included there were 9 people tied to a chair. We all looked confused and frightened. Our chairs formed a half circle, and the man stood in the middle of us. I took a look at the man standing in the middle of us. He was completely bald and had absolutely no facial hair. He had a nice suit on, but the jacket was ripped in multiple places. After a couple minutes of silence he suddenly clapped his hands and said, Hello, I am now your god. I want you to engrave that into your head. I go by many names but just call me D. I want you all to look around. Those are now your enemies. You want them to fail. To die.  Which one of you wants to live? Two people to my right started to plead with him, but he held his hand up. One of the guys stopped begging, but the other man continued to beg. 

D walked up to the pleading man and grabbed the back of his chair and threw him face down into the ground. Blood started to surround his head while D untied the rope from around his wrists and ankles. D then grabbed the man by his shirt and dragged him to the door. He grabbed him by the hair and jerked his head up. D silently whispered to the man, but the man whimpered in response. After slapping the man across the face D shouted in to his ear, Do you know what is written on this door? The man sobbed and said, I dont know what that means. I cant even read it. Just please dont kill me. Im begging you. 

With a chuckle D said, *Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate"* it means Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. Oh! I have a bonus question for all of you. What is this quote from? After a couple of seconds of silence he cleared his throat and said, This is from a part of the greatest piece of literature ever created. Heard of Divine Comedy? Of course not. How about Inferno? No? Well everyone does tend to call it Dantes Inferno. Its this wonderful little tale about how a man goes through 9 circles of Hell. Each circle represented a type of sin. I loved the concept as soon as I heard about it! It made me quite excited, but it still felt like something was missing. Then one day I was struck by an idea! Instead of just one man going through this incredible journey why not have nine? So I have made a little competition.

He stood around and watched us squirm with fear in our seats. A woman to my left started to whimper, but stopped immediately when D stared her down. 

D walked up to the guy in the far left and tapped on his head. Alex, you just love messing with peoples lives with your lovely wife dont you? He stops and turns to the lady next to Alex and patted the top of her head. Oh sweet Kristy, if only you realized how many deaths you and Alex have caused. Making fun of them online. Telling them to kill themselves. Laughing when you happen to hear that the person you taunted last night killed themselves. After he spit at their feet he moved to the next guy.   

Andreas, was next in line. He started off being addicted to watching Hentai, but quickly started to lose control. He was caught several times staring into the windows of women changing. Recently he started to flash himself to women around malls.

Then the person directly to the left of me. Gus, has already killed 14 people. You could tell from Guss eyes he had zero shame in what he had done. He stared D down with a look of pride and gave him a smile as D walked over to me.

My name is Grant, I am a kleptomaniac. I love stealing stuff. It has gotten bad to the point to where I have started to steal from houses I knew belonged to the elderly. I started to lose the feeling of guilt with each house I robbed. It was like a hobby to me. I wanted to stop, but I would always find myself outside of another persons house at 2 in the morning.

D walked up to the other three and pointed at the man lying on the ground. We all looked at him and saw that he had stopped breathing. He looked at us and said I did you a favor. He was the one that helped bring you all to me. He brought each and every one of you with his little sidekick here. He tapped on the leg of the other man that was begging for his life. The man looked up and begged once more for his life, but D ignored him and continued to speak. They brought each of you here. They did it for the money of course.  Only 10k a person, but you see they are both consumed by greed. The guy on the floor was John and this lovely mans name is Jeremy. Get to know him, but dont kill him.

He walked up to the final two and gave them a smile. With a much softer voice he said, Jeremiah and Malcolm. You two have the purest soul out of all of them. I have added you to in because I want to see if you guys will break with enough pressure. He gave each of them a kiss on their forehead and pointed up. We all looked up and saw over 40 people with guns aimed at us. 

D untied us from our chairs and told us to remain still. Once he untied the last rope off of Malcolm he turned around and said, Tomorrow I will tempt you with lust. Its the first circle in the story! Im so excited. You so much as show desire in your eyes you die. You are in the Limbo room now. This is not a safe zone. If my guys catch anyone of you sinning they will kill you. Alex and Kristy the same goes to you. I would suggest standing as far away as possible. I will have food sent to you, and you have one computer. You do not have any way of sending a message of help. We are in a place where locations cant be tracked. You can contact whoever you want, but you will find out quickly it is useless. He turned around and walked out of the room. 

I have the computer for 2 hours. I decided to reach out to you guys.

Please. If you have any suggestions. Let me know.

Dont send out help.

<TITLE> This Has Been The Worst Super Bowl Ever </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-06 07:31:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Tonight I hosted my first and last Super Bowl party. Well, it wasnt really a party. Two of my best friends, Jerry and Brad, came over with a variety of snacks and two cases of beer. Jerry and Brad were two brothers that moved to Tennessee about 5 years ago. They both started working with me around 4 years ago. I became fast friends with them. Around halfway through the first quarter I went into the kitchen and brought out a six layer dip I bought from the local grocery store earlier in the afternoon. 

About 15 minutes later the dip was gone. I didnt even get to eat any of it. Brad sheepishly grinned at me and told me that it was really good. I gave him a little laugh and called the local pizza store and ordered 2 pepperoni pizzas. They told me it would be about an hour and I hung up the phone. 

The first quarter ended and I couldnt help but feel a little disappointed. Neither the Patriots nor the Falcons managed to get a single field goal or touchdown. I wasnt a fan of either team to begin with, but I just really wanted the Patriots to lose because they crushed my team in the Conference Championships. Jerry and Brad were from Massachusetts so they loved the Patriots.  

The second quarter was amazing for me, but Brad and Jerry were looking a little pissed off so I held back my cheers as much as I could. Right as the first half ended Jerry walked into the kitchen to grab a couple of snacks. I cracked open a beer and watched the next set of commercials. Halfway through Lady Gagas performance (greatest half time show ever) I noticed that Jerry wasnt back yet. I called out to him, but he didnt say anything back. I got off the couch and walked into the kitchen to see that Jerry was standing in front of my fridge. I asked him if he was okay, but he just didnt take his eyes off of my fridge. Brad came into the kitchen and tapped on Jerrys shoulder. 

Jerry shook his head and turned around. He gave us a confused look and started to walk back into the living room. I grabbed 2 bags of chips and followed Brad back into the living room. Jerry was staring at the tv screen with a blank look on his face. I asked him if he was okay and he just muttered, Im fine just spaced out for a couple of minutes. The halftime show ended and it was back on commercials. I tried to lighten up the mood by joking about how bad the Patriots were playing. Brad laughed and told me to Fuck off, but Jerry glared me down with a look of pure hatred. I apologized to Jerry, but he kept staring me down. He only stopped staring when someone knocked on the door. I quickly got up and walked up to the door. 

I collected the pizza and gave him 2 twenties and told him to keep the change. When he took the money he looked behind me strangely and asked what was wrong with the other guys. I turned around and saw Brad and Jerry tackling each other on my couch. I chuckled and told him they were brothers and probably just goofing off. After the delivery driver left I closed the door and walked up to them laughing. I asked them Yall want me to join? They stopped when they heard my voice. Jerry slowly started to raise his head up at me and hanging from the side of his mouth was a sliver of Brads flesh. 

I started to throw up a little but I swallowed it back down and tried to push Jerry off of Brad. After 3 of the hardest pushes I could muster they finally got off of each other. Brads chest was a mixture of exposed flesh, bones, and skin. Jerrys intestines were hanging out of the various rips in his midsection. 

I called 911 and made sure they were separated away from each other. 

It took 45 minutes for the paramedics to arrive. Jerry was completely silent now and already as good as dead. Brad was muttering words I have never heard of while they put him on the gurney next to Jerry and carted them to the ambulance. One of the paramedics asked me if they ate anything strange, but I told him that we just ate some chips and dip that I got from the local grocery store. The paramedic asked me what the brand name of the dip was and I told him it was called 6 Layers of Paradise. He asked me if I ate any, but I told him I didnt get to eat a single bit of it. 

I asked him if it was the dip, but he just put his pen and notepad back in his pocket. He started to walk away, but halfway to the car he turned back around and said, If you have any more of it dont eat it. Dont even touch it. Its getting pulled from the shelves, but over 150 people have been admitted into the hospital just in the past two hours. We are low on ambulances; that is why they are going in the same ambulance. They all have two things in common they ate the same dip and they developed a hunger only human flesh could provide. He got into the back of the ambulance and they drove away.

I probably lost my two best friends, I missed out on most of the half time show, and the Patriots fucking won. This was the [worst Super Bowl ever] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We went to a nearby forest and Stephen buried Drews body next to an oak tree. Stephen cried throughout the whole process. Once he put the last scoop of dirt over the make shift grave he fell on his knees and started to sob. I thought about patting him, but decided he just needed his own space. After a couple of minutes Stephen got up and started to walk towards his car. I followed behind him and got in the passenger side.

For the next hour all I heard was the heavy breathing by Stephen. His eyes were blood shot red and his hands gripped the steering wheel a little tightly to the point to where his knuckles had started to turn white. He pulled into a small restaurant and we got out and walked inside. The lady in the front took us to a table and he ordered the bacon and egg special. I ordered the same thing and she carried our menus away and walked up to the cook. 

I looked around the restaurant. We were the only ones here, but the restaurant seemed to be doing fairly well. All of the tvs were newer and the seats were almost completely new. The kitchen looked to be very well maintained. The color red seemed to be the theme of the restaurant. The seats, tables, and the kitchen walls were all red. I enjoy that color, but I thought to myself about how I would have replaced the color from red to blue. 

I didnt realize how hungry I was until I saw the feast before my eyes. I started to devour every single salty strip of bacon and eggs. Halfway through my meal I felt my phone buzz. Stephen heard my phone buzz and started to stare at me when I decided to keep eating instead of check the phone. When he realized I had no intentions of checking he said, I really recommend checking the phone. Thats why youre still alive. It saved your from Andrew and Drew. He went back to his meal while I reluctantly took my phone out of my pocket.

When I turned on my phone it automatically went to Life is Beta. My character was glowing and floating in midair. Underneath his body New Experience appeared. I clicked the body and the screen showed my character standing in the same type of table I was. The screen slowly started to pan away from my character and went to the kitchen. There was a man lying on the floor gagged and tied up. He was flailing around the floor, and his legs were mostly cut out. The cook walked up to him and bent down next to his body. He used his knife to cut off part of his thigh. When he cut out a sizeable piece he started to remove the fat from the meat. 

Once he was done removing the fat he put the fat on the stove and cooked the bacon with it. He threw the meat in the trash can and focused on the bacon. The man on the ground started to sob but the cook walked up to him and jammed his foot on the guys mouth. The screen went black again and bounced back to my character. My character got out from his chair and started to walk out. Stephens character tried to catch up to mine, but he was far too slow. The cook came out and grabbed Stephen by the back of his shirt. Stephen tried to fight him off, but the cook was far too strong. On the next scene Stephen looked like he was there for days. His legs and arms were peeled off to the bones, and the cook looked hungrily at his midsection. The last thing I saw was the cook plunging his knife into Stephens chest and pulling the knife down. After that my phone screen went back to my home screen. 

I wanted to leave. I knew that was the only way to save my ass, but I just couldnt leave Stephen here to die. I didnt eat another bite of my breakfast, but I waited till Stephen was done. Once Stephen was done with his meal we went back to his car and drove away. 

After enduring the silence for over an hour I fell asleep. When I woke up I saw that we had parked outside of a huge 3 story brick house. He got out of the car and motioned to me to follow him inside. I walked up beside him right as he knocked on the front door. A man in a monkey mask answered the door and panic started to take over me. I tried to run away, but Stephen grabbed me by my right shoulder. He calmly said, Hey Grant, am I here early? The man in the monkey mask shook his head no and said Come inside. Its cold, 

Stephen started to walk inside but when he saw that I hadnt moved a muscle he grabbed my arm and dragged me in with him. 

A flood of memories hit me like a tidal wave. 

The woman dressed in all white that would come into our rooms. She would start by rubbing my thighs and telling me everything was okay. She would then start showing me pictures on her phone of men lying on the ground in several impossible positions. Men with their arms around their right knee and the hand sticking inside halfway through his mouth, and men with half of their midsection cut off and their tongue on the middle of their thighs. 

One guy that would come into our house with a knife in his hand; he would whisper, Are you the one? before finding the right boy and plunging the knife into his chest. 

They gave us schooling every week, but on Wednesdays they would tell us the best way to end a persons life. 

In the middle of my thoughts Stephen grabbed his pocket knife out of his back pocket and plunged it into Grants neck. As Grant started to cough up blood Stephen tossed me his keys and shouted, Go! 

I didnt want to leave him there. I really didnt,

In the last couple of days he was the only one that I have grown to trust. The only one that I have felt was actually family. He had taken down four people before getting stabbed dozens of times by three other people. 

I knew I couldnt help him. I knew that the only person I have loved is now dead.

I ran to his car and started up his engine. I watched him while he drove his car, but no matter how long I watched him drive. I managed to wreck his car within the first 10 minutes I drove his car.

I couldnt find any building to find shelter in. I decided to sit next to an oak tree. Drew may have been a messed up child, but that was how he was raised. That was the truth he grew up believing. Stephen had a normal life until he found the app. I only had a taste of a normal life through the app. I know it may seem like a bad thing, but I owe Life is Beta my life. They have showed me what it felt like to have someone truly love you like family. 

In the middle of writing this out to you all I have had two notifications. 1 being from Life is Beta. It was just a simple quote. Though 3 gave their life for our cause; 14,000 have joined today to kill. We will grow and we will make the world a better place. 

The next was the sound of people mimicking monkey noises all around where I sat.

Im sorry. I couldnt help get rid of them or find every single answer I wanted to get, but I now appreciate life. My life and everyone elses. 

Stephen couldnt get rid of them, but the 14,000 will make a bigger impact. 

If you find the app Life is Beta on your phone dont think twice.

<TEXT> The whole day took its toll on me and I fell asleep quickly. 

In the middle of the night I woke up to something hitting against my legs. I heard the boy start screaming, What if he tastes as good as his dad? I just want a taste! Let me just have a taste! The man finally got the boy calmed down and sat him down on the ground. He sat in front of the boy and said, Drew, you cant be like them. I love you like a son, but you need to calm down.

They got up and left the room. I couldnt sleep after that. I sat in my bed and looked through the browser on my phone. Nothing really sparked my interest. It was just a bunch of shit about the new President, and countless numbers of lists that I must read. I closed out of the browser and clicked on the Life is Beta icon.

The screen went black before white letters floated around the screen. They slowly started grouping together words until they finally placed themselves in their designated spots. Weve saved your life, and all we ask is for you to make a decision. The letters started to fall off of the screen and three words took its place. 

Choose

Kill

Be Killed

I tried to leave the app, but the screen remained the same. I tried hitting the power button, but the phone would not turn off. When I took the back off of the phone the number 5 floated on top of the word choose. The number then changed to four and then three. When it hit 1 I tapped on the icon that said Kill. The app closed down and I turned the phone off. 

I still heard the man talk to Drew in the other room after listening to them mumble a bit more I fell back asleep. 

This morning I woke up to the smell of bacon. I jumped out of bed thinking I was still at my parents house, but when I saw the log walls I could finally calm myself down. I turned on the phone and saw the app logo flashing. When I clicked on it I saw a character that looked exactly like me inside floating in the middle of the screen. He was flashing so I tapped on him and the phone went black for a second and showed the character sitting in an identical bed as me. 

I walked out of the door and walked to the kitchen, and sat down on the sofa in the living room. The animated version of the guy walked up to me and gave me a plate of bacon and scrambled eggs. The sound of knocking came from my phone. We both jumped up and the man put a finger up to his lips. He walked up to the door and saw another man walk in. He was wearing a shirt with a small cookie on the right side of his shirt. 

The screen went black and came back to another scene. I was done with my food and the man was talking to me. I saw the cookie shirt man take out a small pocket knife from his back pocket. Before my character could react a knife was lodged into the middle of his head. The man ran out leaving the knife in my head. The screen went black and came back to a white screen. Kill or Be Killed flashed in black letters before the app closed down.

I threw the phone on the bed and walked out into the living room. There werent any chairs in the kitchen so I took a seat on the sofa. Sweat started to pour down my forehead, but I ignored it. This must be some kind of joke the two decided to pull on me. The man came out and asked me if I was okay. I nodded yes and he went back into the kitchen. He asked from the kitchen, Bacon and scrambled eggs sound good to ya? I called back yes and sank into the couch. 

After a couple of minutes he came back out with two plates of bacon and eggs. My stomach growled in response, but my brain kept me from being happy about a good meal with what seemed like good company. 

He stared at me for what seemed like hours, but he finally said, Hey man my name is Stephen by the way. Im sorry if I have been mysterious so far. Its just I am handing a recent loss myself. Its not only been a little over a week, but it hurts as much as the first day. I had to leave my wife and kid, but I can only imagine how you must be feeling. I understand man. I really do. Kids name is Drew, and he is still a bit unstab

His last sentence was cut off by the sound of knocking. I started to panic and Stephen asked me what was wrong. I whispered back to him about what the app showed. Stephen stared off into space for a while before saying, Good, I thought he was always an asshole. He grabbed a knife from the kitchen and answered the door. The man that was supposed to kill me stood in the entrance with a smile on his face. Stephen said, Morning Andrew, I wasnt expecting you for another 3 days. Andrew looked at him for a second and said, Beta told me you were helping a kid out. Told me to come. 

Andrew started walking towards me, and Stephen crept behind him for a couple of paces before jamming the knife in Andrews back. Andrew fell to his knees while Stephen stabbed him three more times in the back. The whole entire time Andrew laughed and pointed at me. He shouted out, Theyll find you! Theyll find you and kill you like the little bitch you are! He kept laughing before taking his final breath and laid still on the ground. 

I heard the sound of little footsteps behind me and I looked back to see Drew grinning ear to ear. He shouted with joy, Oh you did it! Hes dead. I cant wait to see how he tastes! My momma and daddy told me that he must be sweet from all the cookies he made and ate. Stephen responded back with, No time, we need to get out of here now. Beta told me that we need to leave by 8 and its already 7:45. Drew started to whine, but followed us to Stephens car.

When we were all seated in the car Stephen started speaking. We have 1 hour. Twelve miles away there is a woman. Shes about to kill 8 kids in a school. We get her while she is walking from the parking lot to the school entrance. Ill slow down in front of her and you guys take care of the rest.

He started to drive down the road and I started to relax into my chair. I looked to my right to look out the window but see Drew staring at my chest. He breathed deeply into my ear before whispering, You do smell just like your father. I wish I didnt leave the meat back at the house. He rubbed the side of my neck with his fingers and giggled. Before I could say anything he was back in his seat. 

After a couple of minutes Stephen pulled into an old parking garage. We were the only car there and I started to get out of my chair when he parked. While I grabbed for the handle Stephen grabbed me by my throat. Drew tossed a cloth bag over my head and they dragged me out. 

I landed on hard concrete. 

I grunted and started to scream.

Drew laughed and said, Screaming wont help. There is no one around. You chose to be killed and thats what were here to do! They took the bag off of my face and found Drews face incredibly close to mine. He smiled before slapping me lightly on my face. Stephen looked like he was about to cry, but he managed to contain his emotions. He took out a gun from the back of his pants. 

He said, Im sorry before putting the gun up to my forehead.

I didnt want to sob or plead for my life, but I couldnt think of a different way to react. With snot and tears running down my face I pleaded for my life. I told them I chose to kill not to be killed but Drew kept laughing. Stephen said sorry one last time before pulling the trigger.

Drew fell on my lap. 

I looked at Stephen and he was crying.

He knelt beside Drew and held his head in his hands.

He wailed, You were the only thing that replaced what my son was to me. I loved you even though I knew you for 5 days, but please know I loved you. Please. Im begging you. Please know that I loved you! Please. Please. Please!

I wanted to comfort him, but I didnt know what to say.

We are in a hotel now. 

Im on Stephens phone.

I need more answers, but I know I have a person [I can finally trust] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

<TITLE> I Just Came Back Home After Being Missing for 15 Years [Part 3] </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Two hours after my last log I handed the phone back to the nurse, and told him about a couple of people staring at me through the window. He looked out the window and turned back around with an annoyed look on his face. With a condescending tone he said, Its really not funny to joke around about things like that. Confused, I looked out the window and saw that there was no one there. 

They were just there when I checked a couple of minutes ago. Where the hell did they go?

I knew it would be pointless to try and convince him so I just told him that I was tired and mistook reflections with people outside. He nodded his head and walked out of the room. 

It was now around 11 pm and I could not fall asleep. I turned on the tv and flipped through the channels, but nothing really interested me. My stomach started to growl so I pressed the button with the nurse on it and waited around. Five minutes later a lady walked in and asked, You need something? I told her I was hungry, and she left without saying a word to me back. Twenty minutes later she came back in with a couple of carrots and ranch. I looked at the plate with obvious disappointment, and asked if they had anything else. 

I stared down at my plate for a couple of seconds after I asked her, and when I looked back up she was gripping onto the side of my bed with both of her hands. Her knuckles started to become white and her breathing started to get heavier. With as much venom as she could muster she whispered, Listen to me you little shit. I dont want you to eat. I want you to fucking starve. You understand me? Eat the fucking carrots or go hungry. I dont give a shit. Just dont fucking press that button again and go to sleep.

She stormed out of the room and I sat there confused and worried. I put the plate of carrots and ranch on the side table. I started to get comfortable on my bed when I noticed a pair of eyes looking at me through the window. 

Slightly pissed off I looked out the window. I didnt care anymore. I was just tired about whatever the fuck my parents were trying to do with me. 

Let my kidnappers get me again.

I just did not give a shit anymore.  

Right as I lifted my hand to bang on the window I saw what was staring at me. My fathers dismembered head was placed on top of the bush. His eyes were wide open and his mouth was sewn shut. Matt was lying on the ground next to the bush with his stomach torn open, and my mother had two bones sticking out of her chest and head. Right as I was about to start screaming I felt someone covering my mouth with tape. I tried to twist around, but the person holding me was far too strong. 

I struggled as a cloth bag was placed over my head and I flailed around as much as I could while my arms and legs were getting tied together. The person picked me up and at a very fast speed. I heard him rushing out the doors, and the cold air instantly hit me. He stopped running and I heard the sound of a car trunk opening. I tried screaming through the tape, but I knew there was no way anyone could hear me. I was thrown down and the person closed the trunk door. I heard two doors open and shut and, a couple of seconds later I felt the car peeling out. 

I knew for a fact that I was going to die. There was nothing I could do. 

I tried to get as comfortable as I could, but the trunk was far too small. Every single minute I felt the trunk get smaller and smaller until I couldnt move my body at all. Having a bag over my head and only able to breathe through my nose made me feel like I was truly trapped and helpless. I just wanted to die. I wanted to give up, but even that option had been taken away from me. That is when I decided to start throwing my body against anything that was in my way. I started to gain more and more space until the car came to a stop. The sound of a childs laugh brought a wave of fear across my body. 

Was I back at the house?

Is there where I spend my last minutes?

I heard the trunk open and they started to grab the items that surrounded my body. After a couple of minutes I felt two small hands grab my ankles and two larger hands grab me by my shoulders. I tried to jerk my body so they could lose their grips, but they held strong and kept carrying me. 

They sat me down on a chair and took the bag off of my head. I found myself in a house, but not any house Ive seen before. We were in what seemed like the living room. It was dark in the living room, but I could still see both of their faces. A man who looked to be struck with infinite depression and a little boy who seemed to be the happiest thing around; the boy stuck out his hand and said, Hey bud. Were kinda the same. You lost your parents and I lost mine. Its okay. They were bad people. By the way your mom didnt taste as good as your dad so I didnt really want to finish off your mom, but your dad is kinda still with us! 

The man put his hand up to the boy and stared at me for a bit before saying, I dont know what kind of trouble youre in, but be calm. We were told to help you. So we did.

I wanted to be calm. I really did, but after what the boy said how did they expect me to be calm? I tried to think of a way to ask a question that wont set the boy off on me. Once I thought of one I took a deep breath and asked, So why the killing? Or the eating? I know they were evil, but why them and not anyone else? Why did you take me instead of just leaving me there?

The man sighed and glared at the boy. He shrunk down in his seat and muttered, I was just tryna help. The man looked back at me and said, We kill because thats what we were told to do. Sometimes we dont kill, but most times we do. The boy has developed tastes through his parents. They did the same thing we do now, but they have started to lose control with hunger and started killing innocent people. I dont know why they chose your parents and the cop. I really dont. They told me to take you so we did. He stared off into the kitchen after his statement. After thinking about his answer I only had one more question. They?

After a couple of seconds he looked back at me and shrugged his shoulders and pointed at a door. Theres your room. You have a phone that you can use. There is internet, but I advise against contacting anyone you know. Im tired Im going off to bed.

They took the ropes off of me and the boy skipped into the room next to mine and the man sat down in the couch behind me. 

I had more questions, but I started to walk to my room. 

When I opened my room I heard the man cough behind me. I looked back at him and he said with a tear falling from his eyes. I lost everything. Just know that. I had a wife and a 2 year old kid, but all of that was ripped away. I dont know what is going through your head right now, but just know that we are here to help you. Look through the phone. Youll find answers.

I told him thanks and walked in my room. It had a bed and a little side table. A phone was lying on top of the side table attached to a charger. I took it off of the charger and looked around the phone till I found the button to power it on. There were only two icons on the screen. One was for a browser which I used to write down this log to you all. The other one was a simple looking app. A blue box with a white circle inside of it; it was called Life is Beta. 

I didnt feel like looking into it tonight, but tomorrow I will look into it. 

I think I finally found someone to [trust now] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TEXT> So I kind of noticed that there was a bit of negativity going around in the OOC. I'm not saying that it is unwarranted, but I just want to see if we can make each other smile.

*Not Creepy Smiles* Well maybe just a little.

So let's just tag a bunch of new authors that have started in the last month and give them a compliment on the comment section!

If someone stuck out to you as becoming someone really good or is already really good bring them in! </TEXT>

Everything is real here.

Criticisms are done through the messages.

How is that not a hard concept?

I only got frustrated because all day I have been getting comments about how there is information missing.

It's a series. If i made all of the information consistent and out in the open then there is no point in a series. 

The narrator and reader figure things out as the story continues, but how is that possible when everyone keeps pointing out the obvious??? </TEXT>

<TITLE> I Just Came Back Home After Being Missing for 15 Years [Part 2] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-31 14:28:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This morning I woke up to the smell of bacon. I got out of bed, took a quick shower, and went to the kitchen. My mother gave me a smile and asked me if I was hungry. I gave her a nod and went to the dining room and sat down. My father came down a couple of minutes later and stood next to me while breathing down my neck. When I looked up at him he said sharply, So youre just going to sit around and not help your mom with the food? Do you think shes your personal cook? 

I got up from my chair and walked into the kitchen while my father glared at me the whole way there. When I got to the kitchen I heard my father scoff while he pulled a chair out. My mother shoved three plates of bacon, eggs, and grits and told me to put them on the table. I carried them in and placed the dishes down. I went back in, but my mother walked past me while saying Done and put a fork beside each plate. 

No one spoke during the entire meal. I tried to think of something to say, but each time I thought of something I would quickly dismiss it. I just wanted to see if they would somehow slip up and give me some information about my kidnappers and how they planned on getting rid of me.

Once they finished eating they got out of their chairs and walked back upstairs. I didnt get up until I heard the door to their bedroom close. I tiptoed upstairs and put my ear up to their door, but it was completely quiet. 

I kept my ear pressed to the door for a bit more until I felt something grab at my right foot. I yelped in surprise when I saw two fingers holding on to my toes. My father sneered, You know its impolite to spy in on your parents room dont you? I pulled my foot away from his grip and raced downstairs. My father came out with a small handgun and pointed it in my direction. While I ran out of the front door I heard my father scream out to me Sooner or later theyre going to get you again! You running away just makes our job easier! 

I didnt know where I was going, but I knew that I couldnt stay at my parents house any longer. The next two hours was a mixture of running and walking countless steps. With sweat pouring down my shirt despite the cold weather I finally found a welcome sight. 

A cop car. 

 I flagged the car down, and Matts head popped out of the window. He didnt ask me any questions. He just told me to get in and explain when we got back to the station. 

The car ride was filled with silence which made the next 10 minutes a perfect time to fully think about what the fuck was happening. My parents were definitely in on my kidnapping, but why would they send me away for 15 years, send me back home, and kill me off? Why not just kill me off to begin with? As questions started to flood my head I felt the car come to a stop. 

Matt took off his seatbelt and got out of the car. I followed his lead and walked into the station right behind him.

We went to an office in the back of the building and took a seat in front of a desk. He sat down at the opposite end and while crossing his arms said Explain.

I took a deep breath and told him all about my parents conversation the night before. How they talked about my kidnappers will get rid of me. Then I told him about the odd breakfast and almost getting shot down by my father when he found out I was trying to eavesdrop on them. 

He could tell that I was still shaking from the incident so he asked me if my father said anything at all while he had the gun in his hands. After calming myself down I told him that he told me sooner or later they were going to find me. Also, having me run away was just helping them out. 

Matt wrote down a couple of things from his notepad and asked me if I wanted a coffee or some water. I told him a glass of water would be fine. As he got up and started to head out of the room I asked him if he could get and investigator or detective or anyone that can figure this out for me. With eyes filled with pity he told me that since we were a small town it would take some time to get anyone else down here. He gave me a little pat on my shoulder and walked out the door. 

He was gone for what seemed like hours. It started as just an annoyance, but it quickly elevated to panic. I tried opening the door several times, but no matter how much I tugged at the door it remained in the same exact spot. The world around me started to spin and I fell to the ground.

I woke up to the sound of a constant beep in the background. When I opened my eyes I saw a young lady in a white outfit standing in front of me. She smiled widely at me and asked me if I was feeling alright.

No, I really wasnt. The sight of her made me freak out. I started to tear at whatever was around me. I grabbed at the pole with my IV attached to it and launched it at her. She managed to avoid getting hit by the pole, and pain exploded in my right wrist. I tried to grab for her, but she hurried outside of the room. I got out of bed, but after a couple of steps the dizziness came back and I blacked out once more. 

It was dark when I woke up again. I saw gauze and tape around my right wrist and the IV was now attached to my left wrist. I looked around the room and saw that there was a tv in the far right corner. A man was asleep in the next bed over, and there was a little controller attached to the wire on the bed. I found a little icon that looked like a nurse and pressed it. Two minutes later a man walked in the room with the same white outfit. A shudder ran down my spine, but I restrained myself. I asked him to turn on some cartoons for me. He showed me how to control the tv with the remote. 

Before he left I asked him if I could use his phone to log down a daily log. He hesitated for a second, but handed it to me and told me that I have 2 hours with it before his shift is over. 

I was re-positioning my pillow when i saw an envelope under my pillow. The letter "M" was written on the front of the envelope. I opened the envelope and took a photo of when i was 4 out. 

On the back there was a little note for me, "You're only alive because I'm a cop. I wanted to kill you as soon as I talked to your for the first time, but we already have people that will do that for us. Show this letter to anyone if you want. They won't listen. You're the kid that just came back home after being missing for 15 years. The crazy and unstable kid. It's my word against yours bud."

Im logging to you from the nurse's phone, but as I got to the middle of this log I had the feeling of being watched. I looked out the window and saw my parent's and Matt staring through the window of my room. When my eyes met Matt he mouthed the word "Stay".

Without Matt who can I trust [now] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks)?

<TEXT> Dude.... 

It's called a series.

This is called nosleep where you don't try to disprove stories on here... Do you guys really not know how this works???

In a book. You have countless chapters. Or a series of books have countless pages. 

Take series of unfortunate events. 

Did it all make sense in the first book? Were all holes covered? Or were there holes that filled in those parts as the series went along?

Instead of trying to disprove people who work for fucking hours to entertain your ever so omniscient literature minds. Why don't you just enjoy a story for what it is?

Entertainment.... 

Or just keep trying to write out long drawn out shit worried about NUMBERS when it's going to make all of these comments seem moot as fuck when it ends?

Stick around and comment more shit about numbers. Or just fucking enjoy this shit.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Private School </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-31 04:42:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Being the only Korean in a private school had some good parts and some bad. 

My mother never really wanted to send me to a private school, but I happened to be the only kid in my previous schools history to be expelled in the first grade. This was completely ironic to me because I was the one that was getting teased the whole entire time.

My mother never really got to angry about the whole incident. She actually understood that I was only standing up to myself. She also knew that I was not as good with the English language as the other kids; which made me an immediate target for teasing. Every time I would stutter the other kids would laugh at me and copy me, and every day during recess I would be completely ignored. I held my tongue and contained my temper until a kid copied what I did in an overly exaggerated manner. After five minutes of him copying me I finally snapped and kicked the boy out of his chair. 

I was taken out of class and sat in the principals office till my mother came. They told her I showed a type of violence they do not wish to see here ever again, and told her to just go ahead and grab my stuff as I will not be welcomed back again. 

After we left, my mother took me to the park and told me to go play. I was on the swings when I noticed my mother on the park bench crying silently into her hands. 

Even at the age of six I understood how terrible my mother must feel. She brought me to America when I was just three months old and had high dreams for us. When we came she had a very good grasp of the English language, but when I was 3 she had a stroke. While she recovered I stayed with my aunt and uncle, but they mostly monitored over my mother. After she recovered around 6 months later she was back to normal, but suffered from memory loss. She learned Korean again, but never relearned English. 

I knew while she was crying to herself because she blamed herself for placing me in such a difficult position, but I have never placed any sort of blame on her. As her body started to shake and she fell into a loud sob I jumped out of the swings and started walking up to my mother. Before I got to her; another lady walked up to her and her two kids ran up to me. 

They asked me if I wanted to play with them, and when I noticed that my mother was now talking to their mother I nodded my head at them. 

They were telling me all about the school they went to. How everyone was really close, and they would really love to have me there. I shook my head at them and mumbled I dont think so and started swinging again. 

They kept trying to talk to me, but I didnt want them to start teasing me if I stuttered so I just silently stared at them when they talked to me and either shook or nodded my head. 

After about an hour their mother got off of the bench and hugged my mom. The lady called for her children and they immediately left after waving to me. My mother wiped the tears off of her face and walked up to me. She hugged me when I met her halfway and told me she found another school I can go to.

We went to the school the next day. Three Cross Christian Academy was displayed proudly on the school and we walked inside. We were greeted by an overly excited lady. She nearly choked me out with the hug she gave me, and grabbed my shoulder as she led us to the principals office. 

The first thing I noticed about the office was how absolutely clean and organized everything was. A couple of minutes later the principal walked in and gave me a very firm handshake. He looked at my mother and told her We will accept your son into our school, but please know that we do not tolerate any kind of violence or harsh language. Meaning no hitting of any kind or cursing. You will not use our Lords name in vain and you will study diligently so that you may be blessed in your coming years.  Understood? He stared at both of us until we both nodded. 

He smiled and sat back down. My mother wrote a check that covered the rest of the school year and I was sent to my first class. When I walked in the whole class stared at me and the teacher asked me to stand beside her. She asked me to introduce myself and before I could object she stepped behind me and gave me a little nudge. For the next two minutes I tried to put together sentences that made sense without stuttering, but it was just not possible for me. I tripped up on words and paused 4 times while I tried to think of the word. After I finished I went back to my seat, and wished the day was over. 

After the bell rang signifying the end of class I gathered my books and followed the teacher to my next class. While on the way a cheeky kid walked up to me and started to babble on and on about how cool it was I spoke another language. Throughout all of our classes he talked about how I should teach him Korean. During lunch he kept talking to me about how much he likes to play Age of Empires and that I should come over some time so we could have a sleep over. 

We became fast friends after that. His name was Mike and he was always there to stand up for me whenever I was bullied or teased by others. 

All the way to our senior year of high school we remained close, and we always made time for each other. We would spend every weekend with each other playing video games, eating snacks, and watching movies when we were younger to going to parties, driving around town, and going to the mall when I turned 16. 

Everything seemed to finally be perfect. I finally got my first girlfriend who I thought I was in love with, my mother was proud of me, I had great grades, and Mike and I were accepted into the same college. I was not only completely fluent in English; I received the best scores in my class in both papers and English exams.  Everything was finally going well for me until my senior year. 

The day started off normal enough, but when I walked into the third period class with Mike I felt a chill run down my spine. I looked to my right and saw that the teacher was staring me down with a look of pure hatred. Panicking a little inside I rushed to my seat and Mike looked at me strangely. He asked me why I was so pale, and I told him to look at the teacher. As soon as he looked up she was smiling and waving to the students coming in. 

When we were all seated she told us that her name was Ms. Jameson. She walked around the class as she taught our lesson, but every time she passed my desk she would either subtly kick me in the leg or pinch me on the arm. The first couple of times I glared at her, but she would completely ignore my stares. When the class ended I stayed in the classroom until everyone left. 

As soon as everyone left I asked her what the hell was wrong with her. She looked at me for a second and then started to pray. I couldnt hear what she was saying, but she kept glancing up at me in between her prayer. 

I told my mother about it, but she just told me it was just from the stress of being in my last year of college. I know my mother had already been through too much so I just nodded my head and just decided to put up with it.

It wasnt easy but I managed to deal with it for the next two months, but when I found a picture in my locker of when I was 6 with you will find forgiveness through death written in red over my body I completely lost it. I walked into Ms. Jamesons class and slammed the picture in front of her. She stared at the picture for a while, but just sat there and remained quiet. After a second she whispered There are no cameras here and proceeded to stare at the picture in silence. 

There was no question that she was the one who put the picture in my locker, but I knew no one would believe me. The principal already didnt like me as he still thought of me as a violent little kid, and I knew if I left this school I would be out of options. I was only months away from graduating and so I just stuck it out. Whenever I found a photo in my locker I just threw it away, and when Ms. Jameson made her jabs or stared me down I started to jab her back and stare her down as well. 

I didnt care anymore. I just wanted to be done with the year and go off to college with Mike. 

It was the same shit until the last month of my senior year. 

Mike started to ignore me and start spending more and more time with Ms. Jameson. I dont know why, but whenever I tried to hang out with him after school he would just tell me he was busy as he walked into her classroom. 

When I would try to listen in all I heard was a weird sort of chant between the two of them. I tried to joke around with Mike and say What up teacher lover but he would just shove me off and ignore me. 

Mike intentionally ignored me till today; two weeks before graduation. 

At the age of 18, Mike was found in his room with a knife in his chest. His mother called me that day and told me the news in between sobs, and asked if I had any idea what happened. I heard a ringing in my ear as I told her I had no idea. She let out a little sigh and just hung up the phone. Even though we had fallen apart in the last few weeks I was filled with more sadness than I have ever felt in my life. I sat on my bed as I felt a wave of tears come down my face. I tried to hold back from crying, but I fell into a deep sob. I wanted to stop, but I kept getting hit with the memories of the time we spent together.

Four hours later I heard someone knock on the door. Two cops were standing outside and asked me if they could come inside and get a couple of answers from me. I nodded and pointed towards the couch in the living room. They walked in and sat down. Once I sat on the recliner the first cop extended out his hand and told me his name was Officer Grant. I shook his hand and the second officer just nodded his head at me. 

After a second of silence Officer Grant asked me how well I knew Mike and if he has been acting strange in the last couple days. I told him we had been close for over ten years now and that the past two weeks he had been acting distant around me. 

Officer Grant stared at me for a couple of seconds and asked if I had ever received any strange photos of myself. I told him that I started receiving old pictures of me with you will find forgiveness through death written on it. The other cop started to jot down on his notebook. Confused, I asked Officer Grant what was going on. 

He took a deep breath, and said I cant really tell you, but I feel like you should know. Your friend Mike was holding on to two things when we found him. A photo of the two of you playing on the computer, and over your body unforgivable was written on it. He left a note for you, and before they took it away for evidence I wrote it on my notepad.

He handed me his notepad and I felt the blood drain from my face once I finished reading it.

All fucking year long dude. 

All you talked about was how we were going out of town for college.

You never asked me if I wanted to go. You didnt care.

I wanted to stay. I told you several times that I wanted to stay.

All you did was ignore what I wanted.

This is your fault. Youre going to be found dead tomorrow because you cant fucking listen.

Ms. Jameson? The one you thought was evil and hated you? 

Dont worry I hated her too. 

An hour before school started I tried leaving a little message in your locker. 

I panicked when I saw that bitch walking down the hall so I tried to put it back in my pocket.

I dropped it. Can you believe it? She saw it and she tried to give you a couple of warnings.

Luckily youre too full of yourself to understand what she was trying to do. 

I know you wont read this letter, but Ill make sure its between the knife and your heart.

Maybe you will get the message then.

Have a final good night.

I handed the notepad back to him, and sat in silence for what felt like an eternity. I heard the officers getting up and leaving. 

I wanted to get up and just resume the day like nothing happened, but I feel as if I am glued to the couch.

Im still sitting on the couch, but I decided to pass along a message to you guys.

Know who your friends are, and know who your enemies are. I feel bad for ignoring Mikes complaints, but I now feel far worse about the way I treated [Ms. Jameson] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> I Just Came Back Home After Being Missing for 15 Years </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-30 12:35:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello my name is Phil and I am 19 years old. Yesterday my mother and father saw me for the first time in 15 years. It would have been an amazing moment had I not been lying on the front yard of their house blindfolded with my arms and legs tied together. I woke up this morning to our house filled with all of our close family members and a couple of reporters. A police officer showed up at around 3 pm, but he told us he would just wait around till everyone left. The reporters tried to get information out of me, but I was not in the mood to give them any information. My aunt and uncle asked me if they hurt me, but before I could tell them no another reporter started to bombard me with questions. Annoyed, I left the living room and sat in the kitchen for the next hour. 
 
Everyone left except the police officer around 4 pm. He asked me if he could speak with me in private. We went to the kitchen and took our seats at the dining room table. He took out a notepad and with a forced smile on his face he told me to call him Matt.

*Me- So Matt I honestly dont know who took me or where I was.*

*Matt- Thats fine I just have a couple of questions. How many other people were with you?*

*Me- Well in total around 25. When I left there were around 17.*

*Matt- All males? Or were there any females?*

*Me- All males.* 

*Matt- What was the general age group?*

*Me- No one was under 4 or over 20.*

*Matt- Did the people that took you hit anyone?*

*Me- Not that I know of. They never laid a hand on me. They did shoot anyone that tried to leave the house. 4 tried to escape while I was there. 1 survived the gunshot and returned to the house the next day. He never said another word to any of us after that. A couple of people were found dead the next morning after they didnt follow a rule, but we never saw them get killed. Not even the person staying in the room with them would notice when they came into the room or how the person was killed.*  

*Matt- They? How many people were there?*

*Me- I only saw 2 on guard at a time, but the people seemed to change all of the time.*

*Matt- Can you describe what the place looked like?*

*Me- It was a house. A really big house. Not very fancy, but it had around 12 rooms. We all had our names written on a whiteboard next to our specified room. Our fridge was always stocked with enough food for all of us. We had a tv in the living room, but we never could find any channels that worked on it. Each of our rooms had 2 beds and 2 small dressers which contained only 3 of the same outfits. We had a laundry room with a washer and a dryer, but they would only work on Thursday.*

*Matt- 3 of the same outfits? What was the outfit?*

*Me- It was a plain white t-shirt and blue pants. Everyone wore the same exact thing. One 18 year old kid used blueberries to die his shirt blue, but the next day I found him lying on his bed dead. He had blueberries and bits of his blue t-shirt in his mouth. No one tried to change up their clothes after him.*

*Matt- How many people died while you were there?*

*Me- I know of 9 people that were killed. 14 people left the house along with me, but I dont know if the rest just went back to their house like me.* 

*Matt- Could you ever look outside of a window and see what was around you?*

*Me- I stared outside of the windows countless times. Sometimes I would see a person walking around the house carrying a gun, but other than the people all I could see was countless rows of trees. They stretched so far back and wide I could not see anything else.* 

*Matt- Did anyone ever come inside of the house?*

*Me- They would come inside to pick up the person that was ready to leave the house. Two people would come inside and grab the person that was leaving. They would have two pieces of rope and a black blind fold. They would tie his arms and legs together and put the blindfold over his eyes. After that they would carry the person into the wall of trees.*

*Matt- Did they ever show their face?*

*Me- No, never. They would wear monkey masks whenever they came in. None of us ever had the guts to take the masks off of any of the people.* 

*Matt- Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. Ill contact you back if we have any other questions or if we make any new developments. Youre a brave man. Please let us know if you find or remember anything new.* 

After Matt left I headed upstairs to my bedroom. I passed by my parents room and heard them quietly talking inside. I put my ear up to the door and heard my father talking to my mother. 

* -argoret, dont worry. This was part of the program. He will come back for 5 days to live with us. After that they get rid of him and make it look like a suicide. This is the only way they can make it as less suspicious as possible.*

I rushed to my room and quietly closed my door. I thought about calling Matt, but I really want to figure this out.

I have [5 days] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TITLE> My Wife's Aunt </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-28 10:43:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Three months ago my wife and I were contacted by her aunt saying that she needed people to take care of her. She offered a free room in her 3 bedroom apartment, and said she would fund all of our groceries. At that time we were not completely secure financially so we took the offer without a second thought. It seemed like an amazing opportunity for us to save up some money, and the fact that her apartment was only 5 miles away from my current job made the deal seem too good to be true.

Ive met her aunt a couple of times and she actually seemed like pretty decent person. Her name was Esther, but she insisted I call her Essy. The only major problem I had with her before moving into her apartment was she seemed like she couldnt do anything for herself. 

The first couple of weeks we lived with her we started to get comfortable in our new home. Essy never really asked us to do much. All she really wanted us to do is make her meals and change the channel for her if she got tired of watching constant Andy Griffith re-runs. Essy loved lying in bed while watching tv and chain smoking cigarettes. We never really minded since we could smoke in the apartment as well while enjoying our privacy. Sometimes she would leave her room and join us in the living room to watch a movie with us or talk about the past. 

Five days ago she came out into the living room to watch a movie with us. Around the middle of the movie she asked if we wanted some popcorn. We both said yes and before I got off of the couch Esther started walking to the kitchen. Three minutes later I heard the microwave going off and Esther took the bag of popcorn out of the microwave. She tried grabbing a large bowl out of the cabinets but ended up falling and hitting her head on the corner of the stove. I jumped off of the couch and ran up to her. I asked her if she was okay, but she just fell asleep in my arms. My wife was already calling for an ambulance.

When Esther came back she seemed like her normal self the first 2 days. She would tell us what she wanted to eat for dinner, what she wanted to watch on her tv, and if she was running low on cigarettes. 

Three nights ago Essy asked my wife if we could get her some subway for dinner. She said yes and asked her what kind of sandwich she wanted, but Essy just told her she didnt know yet. Before I headed off to subway I went into Essys room if she made her decision yet, but she just stared at me before saying Just tell that man in the red hat to fuck off. I asked her what man with a red hat, but she just looked at me with a confused look on her face. What do you mean Essy? I asked her with a hint of concern. She kept staring at me for a couple more seconds before saying Roast beef and nothing else. Just roast beef. Thanks. Not wanting anymore of the conversation I rushed out and grabbed the subs. I got back and put the sub on her bed. She thanked me, but still feeling a little uncomfortable about our earlier conversation I left without a single word. 

The next day she was normal up until lunch time. I had the day off so I brought here a tuna sandwich with some French fries, but as I laid the plate down in front of her she asked me if I could tell the Asian man to go away. I thought she was talking about me since I was Korean, but she kept pointing outside of the window. I was trying to think of a way to tell her that no one was there, but I was interrupted by the sound of my wife screaming. I ran into our room and saw that she was in our restroom. When I got into the restroom I saw blood trickling down the side of her head. I grabbed some toilet paper and put it against the small cut on her head, but she swatted my hand away and told me that the brush was moving on its own. 

When I asked her what she meant. She just fell onto my shoulder and cried while slamming the brush against the counter. 

I just never really believed in anything paranormal, and even at that point I just thought the stress was what was causing them to envision these crazy things. I mean, my wife bleeding from the side of her head is scary, but anything could have caused that. 

It was never a hard thing for me to disprove anything paranormal until last night. 

I was watching a movie alone since my wife already went to bed. About ten minutes into the movie I started to hear knocking coming from Essys door. I got up and peeked into her room, but I saw that she was asleep on her bed. I started to close her door when I heard her whisper Just take off the hat baby. I know. I know you dont want to, but the world has to see. They need to see the blood youre trying to hide. Take the hat off baby. Please, just take the hat off.

I felt the blood rush from my face. My hands started to shake, but I managed to shut the door without much sound. After I closed her door I rushed to the couch. On the way there I heard a pop and I dove as quickly as I could on to the couch. 

I dont know why a light bulb that was never turned on would shatter, but I feel like it was more than a coincidence.

Esther is acting weird and so is my wife.

<TITLE> The Pizza Bus </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-28 10:38:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In our college we had three possible places we could get pizza. One was in the middle of our campus. We could buy a slice for 2 dollars or a whole pizza for 15 dollars. It was run by a lady with three teeth missing and dirty greasy hair falling out of her ancient hair net. 

Not very popular.

The next was a major pizza franchise that sells really flat cheese bread and over priced wings. The pizza is somewhat good, but the 20 dollar price tag on even the most basic pizzas made it only the second most popular option. 

The last and greatest choice was a bus that would park at the back end of the campus. He always had a funny joke and a great pizza for every person that walked up to the bus with just 8 dollars in their hands. 

I instantly fell in love with everything about the pizza bus. The unique idea of pizza being cooked and served on a bus, the way the pizza thin crust would crunch with every single bite before it became mush, and the way there always seemed to be the right amount of grease on the pizza and jokes from the owner of the pizza bus. His name was Josh and he quickly became one of my favorite people. 

I was an awkward 19 year old boy that never really made any friends. If anyone tried to talk to me I would always manage to say all of the wrong things or just stare at them until they awkwardly walked away. That is why the first trip to the pizza bus was so important to me.

Right as I started to get close to the bus I could already smell the wonderful aroma of a pizza cooked just right. I saw people gathered around the bus, and every couple of seconds I could hear laughter from the crowd. Right when I got up to the bus I saw the happiest person in the world making a couple of jokes while he tossed two pizzas into the oven. 

When he saw me he gave me a big smile and said Nice to see a new face! What kind of pizza would you like my man? I told him I just wanted a cheese pizza, he started to spread the sauce on the thin crust. He sprinkled two cups of cheese on the pizza while saying I dont mean to be cheesy but your smile just earned you a dollar off this pizza! I wasnt smiling, but at the end of his comment I was beaming like a brand new lighthouse.

After that amazing first visit I kept going back to the bus twice a week. 

3 months of me consistently being a customer Josh finally asked me if I was looking for a job. I immediately told him yes and the next day I walked up to the bus for the first time with a smile before I walked up to the bus.

The next month and a half flew by with a mixture of freshman classes and endless pizzas on my hands. Every night I smelled like pizza even after my shower, but all of it seemed trivial. I was making 11 dollars an hour and I had the best boss in the world. 

Yesterday, which was the last day before winter break, was when Josh started to act strangely. I wanted to say that it was the stress of suddenly having to work by himself because I was too busy with my exams, but it has gone far past that. 

I saw Josh writing on a piece of paper, but when he noticed I was coming he shoved the note in his pants pocket and waved at me. I waved back, but I asked him if he was writing a break up letter to his latest sexual conquest. He stared at me for a couple of seconds and told me to fold up some pizza boxes. 

Thrown off by his command, I asked him if he was okay. He said Fine and pointed at the boxes. I figured he was having a bad day so I just started to fold up the boxes. The first four customers didnt really notice anything different about him and left with a perfectly made pizza in their hands. When a girl walked up to the bus Josh shoved past me and walked up to her. She grabbed him by his collar and pulled his ear up to her mouth. She whispered a couple of things to him and he nodded slowly when she pulled away from him. He then handed her the piece of paper he wrote on. She took a quick glance at it, put the paper in her pocket, and walked away. 

A couple hours go by and I try being funny again with Josh. I asked Josh with a little wink, So that woman someone you know really well? Without even a chuckle he stared me down before saying, Watch for her. If she comes tell me. I am who she looks for.

I tried asking more about her, but stopped when he rushed up in front of my face and heavily breathed on my face. I tried taking a step away from him, but he kept scooting up to me and kept breathing on me. As soon as I said, Ill just keep folding boxes Josh sniffed and went back to counting the money in his drawer. 

At 10 pm we started to close down the bus, but one last customer walked up to the bus. Josh tried telling him to come back tomorrow, but I quickly asked him what he needed before he ended his statement. He mumbled Pepperoni and I got right to work. As I handed him the pizza he looked at me and said Its not right I asked him what he meant, but he just stared down at the box and screamed Its not right asshole! What the fuck did you just give me? I tried to calm the man down, but Josh suddenly ran up to him and started to bite down on his nose. The man screamed and started to run away.

When the man ran about 20 paces away from us he opened the pizza box and started to devour piece after piece. He screamed in agony with each bite, but he kept eating. When he finished his fifth slice the man fell and foam started to come out of his mouth. 

Right after I saw what happened to the man I handed Josh my apron and work shirt. I told him I quit, and Josh just took them from my arms without a word. 

Right as I exited out of the bus I started to run back to my dorm. One the way I saw 7 people lying on the ground with foam coming out of their mouths. 7 people that I saw earlier that day buying pizza from us.

I dont know who that woman is. I dont know what is in our pizza or why our customers are foaming out of their mouths. I want to go back to work tomorrow to try and figure it out, but I dont know if I want to sacrifice both my [winter break and my life] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TEXT> The real horror is all of the lonely cat women showing up at your house one day. 

The leader of the group has the hollowed out head of the director of your film.

You hear a soft noise coming from inside of the head, but it is far to muffled to hear what it is for sure.

They start moving up to your house one step at a time. Right as the leader of the group walks up to your front window you see a cat poking it's head out of the director's hollowed out eye.

<TEXT> My original comments were a little too mean. 

I apologize. The story you mentioned was made before they made the no clickbait rule. 

The mods will take down clickbait stories as long as we report.

The commenta aren't automatically taken down because we only have a couple of people trying their very hardest to keep up with the demand. 

I have noticed comments that have nothing to do with the story removed within the next day.

It's good and mandatory we have these rules. It takes time, but we need to have patience and report report report.

<TITLE> Pace </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-26 02:08:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> They say that you need to pace out whatever you eat. The average person cant eat a steak in 5 minutes. There are certain circumstances where you are forced to eat quickly, and today I experienced a severe case of such situation.
Twiddling my thumbs trying to keep my mind focused, but still daydreaming about how long today is going to be. Thinking about the cigarette break that I am going to miss out on because of this long and drawn out presentation.  I cannot help wondering if we are going to get out in time for lunch or if I will be forced to sacrifice my lunch for this never ending power point. 
The worst possible feeling is when you are nicotine deprived and hungry. To make matters worse the presenter after the meeting asked if I wanted to eat lunch with him. I know of a place that will keep our conversations short, and we will be able to enjoy this lunch as quickly as possible. 
I take him to one of my favorite lunch spots. Its placed in a nice discrete location. Not a busy restaurant, but the food always manages to be savory and sweet. He said he needed to use the restroom, and I point him to the back of the store. 
So, it has been over 20 minutes and he has yet to return. The food has been brought out and at that very moment so did he. Time to finally eat after slaving over a computer and abused in the ear. Cant lie, I ate most of the lunch by myself, and I do not feel a ping of guilt. Im sure he wont mind. The meal consisted of the sweetest meat could possibly be. The dish itself was surrounded with various types of sausages that would make anyones mouth water.  It also comes with a light side dish of thinly sliced liver, and a salad surrounding it to make it an absolute homerun.
I would post it on yelp, but they have yet to be listed on that site. 
There is always a downside for everything. Even when it comes to one of the best meals I have had in a while I still should have eaten slower. I just cant help myself around good food sometimes, and I know I will have an immense stomach ache coming back to work. There are also plus sides to this lunch.
I am fully content with this meal. 
I think I have found a new spot to splurge on whenever I am having a bad day.
Above all else, I am content with walking back to work alone.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It has only been a day and I miss my wife and child so much. I know I will never be able to see them without having to turn myself in to the cops. I tried sleeping in the sewers last night. Which has resulted in me waking up various times throughout the night to throw up; I kept getting calls and texts from my wife which has not helped me sleep either. 

This morning when I woke up I saw that my wife had left me a voice mail. I click the notification and press my phone up to my ear. 

Choking through her sobs she said, *You know we could have figured this out together. Why did you have to kill yourself honey? You know I would always love you. You know your son and I would always take your side. Why did you have to be so stupid? Why couldnt you just come home so we could figure everything out?* With a loud sob she ended her message.

I saw my Facebook page had around 40 notifications on it, and when I went onto my profile I saw various posts from old and new friends. All saying RIP, Too Soon, Why did you do it, and some from people I didnt know that said Murderer and Good Riddance.

One person without a profile picture, Olive Johnson, posted a video with the subtitle Enjoyed taping that. I clicked on the video and saw a man that looked exactly like me with the barrel of a gun in his mouth. He was standing in front of my company holding the gun with both of his hands, and when the cops tried to walk up to him to intervene he closed his eyes and pulled the trigger. 

I shut off the video and sat in silence while I tried to make sense of what the fuck was going on. In the middle of my thoughts my phone buzzed twice.

I turned the screen on and saw that there were two notifications from *Life is Beta*. I tried tapping on the first one and it just simply said look up. I looked up to see a man standing over the entrance to the sewer. I tapped the second notification and it said catch. I put my arms out and caught the clothes the man tossed down to me. I put on the red shirt, khakis, and gray dress shoes and climbed out of the sewer. By the time I was out the man was gone. 

My phone buzzed again and tapped on the notification. If you want to see your family again one last time go to your house now. 

I grabbed the first cab and gave him the address to my house. When we got there I forgot that I didnt have money. I checked the jacket pocket and found 20 dollars and a portable battery for my phone. I told the driver to keep the change and ran up to the tree outside of my house. I got another notification that said Climb. 

I climbed up the tree and found a branch that could hold my weight. I sat on it and looked into my bathroom window. I know I should have just savored the last seconds watching my wife and son playing on the bathroom floor, but I had to have something to remember them by. My phone was starting to die, but I opened up the camera app and started to take a video of them. My hot breath against the cold window caused it to start to fog. While I watched them I started to feel tears fall from my face and my fingers started to shake. My wife and kid still seemed to be somewhat happy spending time together, but I would just give anything in the world to be right next to them. After a couple of seconds I saw my wife start to look up and I quickly shut my phone off while putting it in my pocket.

I got down from the tree and started to run. 

I didnt have any clue where I was going, but I just wanted to somehow escape out of the nightmare I have created. I wanted to somehow go back in time and hide my phone in the cabinet like I always did so my son could have never downloaded that god forsaken app on my phone. I dont blame my son, but I just wish he had never touched my phone. 

I stopped running as soon as I felt my phone buzz. I opened the notification and found the video I just took with the words Look familiar on the bottom. 

That moment I was tempted to throw my phone as far as I could, but I knew that this app was still the only thing keeping me alive. I started to think that maybe I could just go back home. I know my wife would be okay with keeping it a secret I was still alive, but I just didnt want to put them in any kind of harm. 

Another buzz and another notification by them. 

When I opened up the app I found two buttons on the screen on the left and right side of my character.

Kill or Be Killed. 

Disgusted, I shoved my phone back in my pocket and continued to walk down the street. 

I felt another buzz, but I ignored it. 

After the third buzz I started running again, and tried to ignore the buzzing. I didnt stop running until I tripped and fell to the ground. 

My phone immediately started to buzz continuously then. I took the phone out of my pocket and saw a video of me stabbing Brad in the throat with the letter opener. It jumped to another video of Brad at his house while he was reading the newspaper. The date on the newspaper was from the day before I stabbed him. 

His dog walked up to him, but he shoved the dog back with his foot. A woman came in and started to yell at him and Brad stood up and started to shout back. She got in his face and started to shove him back. He tries to slap her hands away, but she kept pushing him back. He pushed her back once. That was all it took. She fell to the ground and her head smacked into the edge of the table. Her head bent away from her body at an impossible angle and she stayed on the ground completely still.

The video then shot to Brad stuffing her into a deep freezer. She wouldnt fit, but he kept shoving her in until her bones gave up and snapped.

The video ended and I was met with the two options. 

This is the last thing Im writing to everyone. 

I just want you to know that if you ever find an app called Life is Beta you are chosen. You will be met with a final choice. Most people arent able to handle the stress. They dont choose any of the options. They just lose their mind. The app will keep you safe from them. Just please know that your life will never be the same again.

Choose kill. 

You can help the world get rid of the evil in this world [one rotten soul at a time] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

I mean i definitely see your point of view.

I guess i read too far into the post. It just felt like it was more out of spite than out of the desire for NoSleep to grow. 

Just the fact that those stories were compared to Chicken Soup kind of triggered me.

<TEXT> Well, honestly, if you don't think a story is horror you should report it. 
Or just downvote it if you're too lazy to report anything.

It does far more than writing about how these stories annoy you because it feels like it's out of a Chicken Soup book...

I mean the fact that they write a post on the OOC complaining about a group of stories really does feel like an attack...

Everyone submits the wrong thing from time to time. We get stories removed and we understand it, but I really feel like the OOC should not be used to criticize a block of stories.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right when I woke up this morning I checked my phone to make sure there werent any new Experiences. When I saw the blank screen I felt a bit of relief. I got ready for work and decided to skip out on breakfast today. Got on the same subway I did everyday and checked my phone during the whole entire ride. When it reached my stop I got off and walked the 300 meters to my work. 

I didnt get a single notification until I was in the middle of my lunch.

I was in my favorite sandwich shop halfway through my roast beef sandwich when I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket. With a sigh mixed with anticipation and fear, I checked my phone and saw that I have a new Experience. I clicked on the notification and found my character floating around like he always does, but for some reason his face looked like it was melting off. I tried tapping on the character, but it just stayed on the same screen. My character started to grab at his face trying to keep it in place, but after a couple of seconds he gave up and let his face slide to the ground. 

After a couple of seconds the face disappears from the ground and the character looks back up at me as if nothing happened. I felt wary, but I tapped on my character again.


The whole screen became a deep red and after a couple of seconds it flashed to a family of three enjoying a meal by a campfire in front of a house. They kept pulling out bits of meat from the pot and seemed to be enjoying every single bite. The boy was dancing around the pot while he bit of meat from a larger sized bone. After about 5 minutes of watching them eat, a man pulled up into their driveway. He was wearing a white and red shirt with a small cookie logo on the top right of the shirt. He sat with them and ate a couple of pieces before going into the house first. The boy walked behind the man and picked up a bloody foot off of the ground. He kicked it as hard as he could and started to laugh. He grabbed a hand after that and walked around and acted like he was holding it while the man and woman started to laugh along with him.

The scene started to speed past the family going back in, and finally started going back to its normal speed as soon as the sun rose the next morning.  The door swung open and I saw the man in the cookie shirt step outside while lugging two large bags. The boy ran behind him and started to punch his back, but the man pushed him down to the ground. 

The screen went black for a second and then showed me the man parking in front of a cookie store. He got the 2 large bags out and took them inside. Around 2 minutes later he comes back out, locks the front doors, and starts driving away. 

My phone jumps back to the home screen after that and I put the phone back in my pocket while I tried to make sense of what I just watched. I know that the two bags contained the man and the woman. The young boy is now at his house alone, but I did not really feel bad for him after I watched him play with dismembered body parts. 

In the middle of my thoughts my phone started buzzing again. The notification from the app simply said 
Countdown. I opened up the app and saw the number 32 fill up the screen. 

I knew automatically that I had to leave, but I felt a light tap on my shoulder. I looked behind me and saw a familiar face and shirt; a red and white shirt with a cookie on the top right and a smile displaying bright yellow teeth. He leaned over to me and pressed his lips right on my ear as he whispered Do I know you from somewhere? I jerked my body back and tried to rush out, but he grabbed on to my arm and tried to pull me back. With desperation kicking in, I used my other hand to jab the man in his eye. He yelped in pain and his grip softened around my arm. Seizing the opportunity, I kicked him in the knee and managed to leave the store as the timer hit 3 seconds.

I walked to the side of the building and peeked around the corner. I already started hearing screams coming from the shop when the timer hit zero, and within seconds I saw people rushing out of the store. They all seemed fine except a couple of people who had deep gashed in various places. One man was running out with a deep wound on his chest. He got to the middle of the parking lot before falling to the ground. 

The door opened for the final time, and Yellow Tooth came out with a butcher knife in one hand and with the other he was dragging a man face down. Once he got up to his car he flipped the man over and started to stuff him in his back seat. I wish I could wipe the image of the mans face from my head, but I know I will never forget it. The skin on his face was gone and the flesh of his face had been ripped in various places after being dragged on the asphalt. 

I knew I was still at risk of being seen by the man so I ran back to my company. I didnt stop running until I got to my desk. I took the phone out from my pants pocket and placed it on the desk. 

I know that the app is helping me, but I just wanted the notifications to stop. 

Knowing I was in no condition to work so I sent in an e-mail to the assistant manager that I will have to take the rest of the day off. I knew it would take around 20 minutes for the assistant manager to reply back with his answer; so I grabbed my phone and went to the restroom. 

I was sending my wife a text while I sat on the toilet, but a notification popped up and I automatically clicked it. 

This time the app didnt go to the screen with my floating character. It went automatically to an actual video of my wife and kid sitting on the bathroom floor. It looked like it was taken from outside of the bathroom window. 

The window started to go white from the persons deep breath, but my wife and kid were oblivious to it all. There was a time at the bottom right of the screen. 

13:35 pm.

The camera shifted down and I saw khaki pants and gray shoes and the video cut out. The screen went white and came back to a countdown with Get Him Now on the screen.

I walked into the office and grabbed a letter opener from my desk. I knew exactly who it was. His name is Brad and he has been eye fucking my wife since the Christmas party last year. When I got up to him I saw a picture of my wifes Facebook profile picture on his screen, and that was what confirmed all of my suspicions. I jammed the letter opener in his neck 6 times. Before anyone else could react I ran out the door and continued to run the 300 meters to the subway station. 

I didnt go back home. I know the police are looking for me.

I have received over 20 calls and 45 texts from my wife, but I am not going to check them. 

The only thing I checked was the last notification I received today.

Gotcha

<TEXT> Sooooo you want us to give you our stories for free. (Which is okay)

You also want to make money off of our stories while we slave away between writing and working a job. (Not really okay)

You have not really submitted anything in to NoSleep at all besides 2 removed stories for lack of words, and you insult another person's book who more than likely made a good offer to the authors. (Not Okay At All)

Above all !@#$ing else you ask us to fund your publication so you can start making more money. (Really Douchey)

So, good luck with that.

<TITLE> My Strange Experiences With an App Called "Life is Beta" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-23 07:17:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I woke up to the sight of my 2 year old son tapping away on my cell phone. I put out my hand and after a couple of whines and tears he handed the phone back to me. I checked my phone to make sure he didnt make any phone calls or texts. 

After checking everything on my phone I didnt find any new calls or texts, but I did see an app called Life is Beta on my home screen now. The icon was just a circle inside of a solid blue square.

I put my phone in my pocket, and got ready for work. After I ate my breakfast I kissed my wife and son goodbye and walked to the subway station. The ride to work usually takes around 40 minutes so I turned my phone on and clicked on the app. 

The first thing that threw me off was the fact that there wasnt a loading screen or anything.  It just automatically jumped to a character floating in the middle of the screen. 

The next weird thing was the character looked just like me in every single way. Even the face was exactly like mine down to the two pimples I found on my forehead this morning. Feeling a bit curious, I tapped on the screen and he started to walk towards the right. The screen turned black for a second, and when it bounced to the next screen I almost dropped my phone. He was sitting in a subway while playing on his cell phone. 

After a couple of seconds the subway in the phone stops, and a couple of people got off and on the subway. Right as a lady in a yellow coat starts to get on the subway my character starts to flash and the scene freezes. I tap on the character and he gets up and bolts out of the subway. I try to tap outside of the subway, but the screen keeps showing the subway. The lady that boarded the subway started to pace around the subway, but no one really gave her notice. 

After she walked around three times she started to shake and took out two guns from her purse. The subway is filled with blood and people running around as she empties out both magazines. Once she ran out of bullets she took a knife out of purse and stabbed herself in the chest. 

The screen on my phone went dark and I felt the subway come to a stop. I looked up and saw a woman in a yellow coat boarding the subway. Without a second thought I ran out of the subway and caught a cab. 

The whole cab ride there I kept searching the news to see if there were any recent shootings in my area, but after a while I started to relax and by the time I got to work I was laughing to myself about how dumb I was listening to a dumb game. Right as I sat down in my office chair I got a phone call from my wife. When I picked up the phone I heard my wife say Please, please, please, just answer the phone. I said Hello? and I could hear her breathe a sigh of relief. She told me that she was watching the news when she heard about a lady shooting up the subway I usually rode to work. Right as she told me everything that happened I couldnt really respond. I felt my hand start to shake and my throat felt like it was closing up. I told her I love her and that I would call her back later and hung up the phone. 

I turned the app again, and saw that my character was floating in the middle of the screen. I kept tapping at him, but the screen would not change. I clicked the home button to my phone and tried deleting the app, but my phone did not give an option to delete the app. Frustrated and scared shitless, I just shoved my phone back into my pocket and tried to forget about what happened this morning. 

I didnt check the app again until around 2pm. I felt my phone vibrating so I checked it and saw a notification from Life is Beta. It said New Experience next to the logo; I didnt want to but I clicked on the box in case it was trying to warn me again.  

When I opened up the app I saw an animated version of my manager typing on his laptop. The view shifted to where I was looking at my managers laptop. 

On his screen was a lady holding up a man by his hair. I could see what my manager was typing out. Use your fingers to dig his eyeballs out. 

The woman held up 3 fingers on her other hand and my manager went back to typing. 300 hundred for that? Youre fucking nuts. $200 and we have a deal.

She nodded her head and using her index finger and thumb started to dig out the mans left eyeball. 

I clicked on the home button before I saw anything else, but once I closed out of the app I got another notification. It simply said Call 911.

I ran to the restroom after I dialed 911 and explained to the dispatcher about what my manager was dong on his laptop. I requested that I stay anonymous and hung up the phone.

Fifteen minutes later my manager was taken out of his office by two police officers. He was pleading with them and telling them it was all a misunderstanding, but we could hear the sounds of a man yelling out in pain from our managers laptop. 

That was the last notification I received today, but I will let you know if I receive anymore. 

Stay safe everyone, and be careful with [who you trust] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> Hallmark Inn </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-22 23:27:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I will never go back to the Hallmark Inn; and I would like to give you a very good reason why you shouldnt either. The Hallmark Inn used to be a wonderful hotel. I know this, because I went there when I was really young with my mother and father. The workers there treated us like royalty. The rooms were immaculate, and the tv was equipped with all of my favorite channels. Yesterday afternoon we were told by our manager that we had a company meeting at 8 am the next morning. 

We only lived about 3 hours away, but if we decided to go today we would be heading out at 5 am. So I asked Clark if he wanted to just go up to Nashville tonight after work. He was reluctant at first, but when I told him all about how amazing and cheap the Hallmark Inn was he became excited about my idea. I found the number to the hotel and went ahead and reserved a room for the night. After work we swung by both of our houses and grabbed a set of formal wear for the meeting and changed into some casual clothes for the evening. After I grabbed my things we headed off to Nashville. Clark was in the passenger seat trying to find something to do in Nasvhille while I drove. When he couldnt find anything that interested both of us I suggested maybe asking the hotel employees if they knew of anything. 

We got to the hotel within 2 hours due to my excessive speeding. When I got close to the hotel I started to get excited about spending a night in the hotel I had such fond memories of. The excitement started wavering when I saw how bad the hotel looked from the outside. The bricks have started to deteriorate, and the sign that once proudly displayed Hallmark Inn now read ark nn. Clark shot me a look of concern, but I just told him it looked a lot better inside.  

I didnt have a problem parking since there were only 2 other cars in the parking lot. The lack of cars would normally bother me, but I didnt think much of it since it was Monday. After I parked we walked up to the front doors and tried opening them. Three tries later I saw an old lady walk past the door. I banged on the door trying to get her attention, but she just completely ignored us and walked behind the desk. Getting a little pissed off by point I tried calling the hotel again. 

Busy signal.

I tried calling five more times, but each time I got a busy signal. 

Clark tapped on my shoulder and pointed at a little button on the right side of the door. With a little laugh he pressed the button. It made a little buzzing sound and I saw the old lady getting out of her chair and walk up to the doors. She stared at us for about 10 seconds and opened the door. 

What do you want? was the question she greeted us with.

I started to tell her about how I reserved the room, but in the middle of my sentence she turned around and walked behind the desk. She pulled out a key and stuck her hand out. We each took out 30 dollars and put it in her hand. She put the money in her pocket and threw the key on the desk in front of us. Room 201 was all she said before sitting back on her chair and stared at the front door. 

We both got the hint and walked out of the door. When we got to room 201 I unlocked the door and we walked inside. As soon as I looked inside of the room I apologized to Clark for the horrible recommendation. The once white walls were now piss yellow, the tv looked like the same exact tv that was there when I came here 12 years ago. The sheets on both of the beds looked like they havent been washed in the past year, and from the room I could see that the toilet in the bathroom was black on the bottom. Clark just laughed and told me it was just for a night. 

It was 11 pm by then so we just gave up on the idea of going out. 

I grabbed a bag of chips from my bag and we turned the tv on. 

Good News: Free Porn

Bad News: We only have that one channel.

After awkwardly watching terrible porn for a couple minutes I turned the tv off and reviewed over the meeting notes for tomorrow with Clark. When I got to the middle of the notes we heard a knock on the door. I ignored the knocking since it was 11:30 at night and continued with the notes. The person kept knocking on the door so I started to talk louder than the knocking hoping the person would just give up, but the knocking only got louder. Clark was the first to lose his patience. He walked up to the door and shouted What the fuck do you want? 

A guys voice answered back I just need to use your phone please. Ive been stabbed. Clark drew back the curtain and looked out the window. He waved me over to the window. When I looked out the window I saw a man wearing sunglasses standing outside with a huge gash on his right shoulder. I shouted Do you want me to call 911? The man just nodded his head. I got out my phone and dialed 911, but my phone immediately shut off after I tried calling. I tried turning my phone back on, but it wouldnt no matter how many times I tried. 

I tried using the landline in the room, but when I dialed 911 I just kept hearing an advertisement about Hallmark Inn. Clark already tried calling them on his phone, but the look on his face automatically told me he didnt have any luck contacting them either. I shouted at the man that we would take him to the front desk to see if they can help us. I opened the door and tried to leave, but the man shoved me back inside and walked through the door. He closed the hotel door and walked up to my bed and sat down. I got up to my feet and ran to where Clark was standing. 

The man took his shirt off and smiled at us while he started to rub his gash with his left hand. I wanted to tell him to get out, but I was fixated by his shoulder wound. He then took off his sunglasses and saw that the skin around his eyes was sewn shut. With a low guttural sound he started to tear at his face. As blood started to drip down his face I saw he managed to rip the sewn up skin revealing two empty eye sockets. 

I started to walk up to the man, but immediately came to a stop when tiny black bugs started pouring out of his eyes. They landed on his stomach and legs and started crawling into his gash. Soon his gash was completely filled with the black bugs falling out of his face. He started to scream as the gash continued to grow. After a couple of seconds his screaming suddenly stopped and the man became completely quiet and still. The bugs then crawled off of his body and went to the door. 

We ran to the restroom and locked the door. Clark sat in the bathtub and I sat on the counter next to the sink. I dont know when I fell asleep, but I woke up this morning to the sound of gurgling from the bathtub. I looked over at Clark and threw up in the sink. The black bugs were eating through his eyes and midsection. Clark tried to say something to me, but instead coughed out blood and some of the black bugs. 

I ran out of the restroom and saw that the bugs were no longer in front of the door. 

I ran out of the hotel room and got into my car. I didnt even think to call 911 again. I just wanted to go home. 

When I got home I called the manager and told him that I would not make it to the meeting. I hung up on him while he was telling me about the consequences if Im not there in the next hour.  

I dont know what those bugs were; or if they even are bugs. I really dont know what they are, but I do know that theyre inside of Hallmark Inn now.

So please promise me.

I just wish people would actually report the comment instead of saying "DUDE THE SIDE BAR" "READ THE RULE DICKWAD"

Whenever i get those comments on my stories i'll honestly just tell them "yeah, it's real" and then report.

<TITLE> Korea Has Brought Me Weird Experiences </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-20 10:02:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was 10 years old I went to South Korea with my mother for summer break. When I first heard we were going to Korea I was extremely excited, but my excitement faded away when my mother told me we were going to one of the smaller islands of Korea. Being on an island may sound like a lot of fun, but the island we were going to was basically like a very small town with almost nothing to do. 

When I asked her why we were going there she told me that my grandmother on my fathers side has gotten very ill. My dad was moving from Seoul to the Island, and we were going to be there for my whole summer break. Of course, I was completely bummed about the thought of being constantly bored, but the thought of being able to see my dad was well worth it. He found a job in Korea a couple of years ago, and he has been there since. 

I just wish I had stayed at my grandmothers house the whole entire time. 

During the first week I was in Korea I played around at my grandmothers house. She had about 15 chickens she took care of so I played with them for a good bit, and when that got boring I would talk to my dad and followed him around while he took care of grandma. 

About 9 days into being in Korea my dad asked me if I could go to the local store and pick up a couple snacks for us. I grabbed the 5 out of his hands and started my walk to the store. I had gone with my dad a couple of times so I had the way memorized. Plus, once I got outside it was a straight 2 minute walk without any sort of turns. I got to the store and started to pick out my favorite snacks when I noticed a boy around my age was staring at me from the next aisle. I asked him what he wanted in Korean and he just shrugged his shoulders. 

I took the snacks to the counter and gave the lady my 5. She handed me back 2 dollars. The kid then tapped on my shoulders and asked if I could pay for his snack. He held up a snack that was maybe 50 cents so I went ahead and bought it for him. I knew my dad would have wanted me to so I didnt feel bad about spending more of his money. 

Before I could grab the snack out of his hands to pay for it he bolted out of the store with the snack in his hands. 

I headed out of the store and started the walk back home. About five minutes into the walk I notice that it was taking a lot longer than it should be. I started to walk faster, but I still felt like I was getting nowhere. I broke into a dead sprint and towards my house, but even after what seemed like 15 minutes of running I looked behind me and noticed that the store was still right behind me. 

I didnt know what else to do so I ran back into the store and told the lady I was having difficulty getting home. I gave her my fathers number and waited at the store until he came and got me. I told him about how I didnt seem to be getting anywhere no matter how fast I ran, but he just rubbed my head and told me the streets were confusing. I tried to explain that I literally felt like I wasnt moving anywhere, but he just laughed and walked with me back home. 

When we got back we played a couple games of hangman and munched on our snacks. In the middle of the third game I remembered to give my dad back his change and told him about trying to buy a snack for a boy, but he just ended up stealing the snack from the store. My dad then looked at me and asked me to describe the boy to him. After I was done he looked at me strangely when I finished my description about the boy. 

He asked me if I had gotten his name but I told him he didnt really say anything. He just asked for the snacks and then ran out the door. After we finished the third game he told me that he had to take care of grandma so I just doodled on a piece of paper. 

I cant really draw, but I like to draw squiggly lines around the paper and see if anything recognizable somehow comes out of the squiggles. After five minutes I gave up on the picture as it resembled absolutely nothing. 

I grabbed a book and went outside. I took a bag of chips with me and spent the next hour reading and eating chips. When I was about 40 pages into my book my dad asked me to come back inside. When I walked in my father was holding the drawing I ditched. He flipped it over when I walked in and saw it was a drawing of the boy I saw in the convenience store. I told him that was what the boy looked like, but that I didnt draw the picture. 

He looked over the picture again and threw it into the trash and left me in the room without another word. When he walked into my grandmas room he slammed the door. 

I didnt know what made him so mad, but I didnt really think about that. I was more concerned about why the picture changed on me. I drew scribbles, but the picture on the paper was a fully drawn out face.

I dont know why, but I rushed out the door and ran back to the store. I saw the boy walking around the store and I walked up to him. He didnt really notice me so I said Hello! He looked at me and I asked him what his name was. After a couple of second he said Umpyo.  I remembered my dad never took back his change so I asked him if he wanted to share a snack with me. He nodded his head and I bought the same snack he asked me to buy.

When I walked out of the store I saw that he was gone.

I was a bit bummed out, but I just started walking back to my house. When I was around half way there a man ran out of his house and grabbed me by my shoulders. He reeked of alcohol, and he asked with a sob Umpyo? I looked at him and he let go of me quickly. After he looked at me for about 5 seconds he went back into his house without even saying sorry.

I ran back into my house and into the room I was staying in. I stayed in there and read books until I became tired. Around 10 oclock I fell asleep. 

In the middle of the night I heard a light tapping on the window. I looked out and saw that it was Umpyo. I opened the window and he jumped in. When he landed he made absolutely zero noise. He put a finger up to his lips and pointed at my bed. After I gave him a confused look he walked up to the bed and used his finger to signal for me to move it. The bed was light so I moved it over a couple of feet. He pointed at one of the wooden panels on the floor. I felt over the panel and realized that there was a little opening. I lifted the panel up and found myself staring at a dead Umpyo.

Alright...

So with me i like to think of cannibalism as an entirely new beast.

Yes, you are getting eaten, but how about the torture involved when you come across a more sadistic cannibal? They don't kill you off the bat. 

Example. 

Kidnapped and tied up to whatever unique your mind can come up with. A man in a horse mask walks up to you with a small butterfly knife. He starts to do a couple of butterfly knife tricks in front of you while giggling. Then with his final trick he jams it right on top of your knee cap. 

He slowly slices off a steak sized piece of meat from the top of your right thigh. You feel the excruciating pain of each slice. After 8 minutes he's finally done and walks up to the stove that is placed next to you.

With a dash of olive oil(gotta stay somewhat healthy) and soon the sweet smell of your flesh cooking overpowers your nose.

After he's done cooking he pours some oil on your open wound and puts the still hot pan over your exposed muscle. 

You scream and wince in pain. 

Beg him to stop.

He finally does.

That sweet smell hits your nose once again.

You look down on your leg and see that it is now predominately gray cooked flesh.

Tomorrow and the days following is just another cut of meat. </TEXT>

A sweet smell fills the air

Body parts of past mods

Eaten by the hungry flames

With the last thread done

Mostly for me it was because you said you needed backers and collaborators. Which drew me in because I like to help out with writing as much as I can.

Then i saw what collaborating meant to your project.

I mean more power to you and I hope your movie goes well.

Just please when you post it later in the future please make sure you just say you can determine the ending for a small contribution instead of you saying you need collaborators.  </TEXT>

We want something to be involved in for free.

u/decomprosed had a very good reason with his indiegogo project because he has been very involved with NoSleep and NoSleepOOC for a very long time now and is a staple member of the community.

He also waited a week before submitting(and even more) a status report of how it was going. 

I hinestly think the execution is poor on this one.

If you needed writers to help you with the movie without having to pay 50 you would have had some type of support.

Sorry but for that I'm very uninterested and a bit insulted. </TEXT>

<TITLE> This Is Something Far Worse Than The Common Cold </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-18 14:15:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Three days ago four people in our office caught a pretty bad cold. I know that may seem absolutely trivial, but let me tell you that this is no normal cold. I dont really know what started it, but I do know that it is that it has quickly contaminated almost our whole office, and if you happen to see someone so much as sniffle around you please avoid them at all costs. 

The first four people to catch it were actually four of our more healthy employees. When they first started to show signs of a typical cold they took all took a couple of days off. When they came back the yesterday we all made sure to wear our face masks during work. I forgot to bring mine, but the guy who worked across from me handed me his spare. Halfway through the day one of the four men started to cough non-stop for the next 2 to 3 minutes. When he took his facemask off I noticed that the inside of it was covered in a thick coating of phlegm. 

I felt a little sick to my stomach as I never handled the sight of phlegm, but I just took a sip of coke and waited till my stomach settled down. Once it settled down I got back to working on my project. Right as I was sending in my project to my team leader I heard the same guy go into another coughing fit. I turned around to make sure he was okay, but the first thing I saw was blood coming out of his mouth with every single cough. The other three sick men started freaking out and rushed out of the door. 

At that moment I saw enough so I took out my cell phone and dialed in the emergency number, but right as I was about to hit the dial button the man stopped coughing. I looked up at him and he smiled at me. I asked him if he was okay and he nodded his head. I asked him if he wanted me to call him an ambulance and he quickly told me he didnt need one. For the next ten minutes I made sure he didnt need an ambulance, and after him reassuring me several times I just shrugged my shoulders and sent in my project. 

When the clock hit 6 pm I got up immediately and gave my team leader a nod. He asked me if I finished all of the projects for today and I told him I finished all of my projects for today and half of my projects for tomorrow. He gave me a smile and told me to hurry home. On my drive back I noticed that pretty much everyone was wearing a facemask and I began to wonder if it has been spreading in other places as well. 

When I got to my apartment I walked up the five flights of stairs up to my room. When I walked past the first flight of stairs I started to hear what seemed like a groan coming from somewhere on the stairs; I ran up 3 more flights of stairs before I found my next door neighbor laying on the ground with a line of blood coming out of his mouth. I knelt down and tried to help him up, but he swatted my hands away. 

I just called the 119(emergency number) and told them about finding my neighbor lying on the stairs with blood coming out of his mouth. I left him there and went into my room and turned on my tv on before I laid down on my bed.

I watched a couple of movies and fell asleep. 
 
This morning when I woke up I looked outside of my window. I noticed that there were several people lying on the streets with little pools of blood around them. 

I heard sirens coming from a distance, and I saw an ambulance pull up to the bodies lying on the streets. Two guys popped out of the back of the ambulance and grabbed the bodies and threw them in to the car without a gurney. They started driving away before they closed the back doors and I saw that there were around 30 to 40 bodies inside of that ambulance.

I called my team leader to see if we were still working, and he told me that we were just having a half day and then we would be off for however long this sickness spreads. I got dressed for work and headed out to my car. When I started to pull out of my parking lot a lady jumped onto my windshield. She was screaming Help me please while banging on the window. I waited until she got off of my car and I drove off while screaming sorry! As I was driving off I saw that she was on her knees grabbing at anyone that passed by her. 

When I got to work I noticed that there were only 7 cars in the parking lot. We usually have around 24 to 27 cars in the parking lot. I ignored the panic that has taken over me since this morning and walked into the office. When I walked in through the doors I noticed that no one was in the office. I called my team leader and he told me to come into the meeting room. When I walked in four of the other employees grabbed me by my arms and legs and the team leader checked me over. As soon as they confirmed that I wasnt sick they put me down and pulled up a seat for me. I took it and the team leader told me that he had a basement in his house that we could all camp out in.

He had enough food to last for over six months, and we were the last ones in the company that hadnt caught whatever was going on. Seven of us out of our 35 employees were the only ones that managed to avoid whatever was going on.

We took the team leaders van to his house and we have been looking out his small basement window for the next couple of hours.

Its 3 pm now and we have witnessed eight deaths just outside of his window. One person fell over in just five feet away from the window. He kept coughing out blood until he stayed still for a while. He started blowing his nose really loud until he let out a grayish clump of mucus. He looked to have gained 20 pounds in the span of 20 minutes after he discharged the mucus. After 10 minutes his skin started to break all over his body and his bones started to rip through his skin and started tearing his flesh open.

He was dead five minutes after that, but his bones kept growing until they started to crack open and gray liquid started to pour out. 

I am only spreading this warning to you, because you never know who is sick or who isnt. The airports were fully booked today by people trying to avoid the sickness, but I will let you know now that they may seem fine now, but in a couple of days you will notice that people around you are now going into full on coughing fits.

Three of our employees have started to cough heavily in just the last 2 hours. 

If you see someone cough or even sniffle. 

Please avoid them [at all costs] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TITLE> I Always Had a Helping Hand </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-17 06:32:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello everyone my name is Jay and I owe my life to two dark and blurry hands. I dont know what it is, and I know I probably will never find out. The amount of times it has saved my life is a mystery to me, but there are a couple of times I have actually seen them. Let me tell you about a couple.

At the age of 4 I ran out in to the middle of the street. I should have known better but my brother threw my unopened ice cream cone out onto the street as a joke. I know I should always look both ways before crossing, but my eyes were fixed on my abandoned treat. When I picked up my ice cream I instantly noticed two things. The sound of a car horn and two dark blurs slamming into my side. I was tossed into the air and landed on my neighbors lawn across the street.

I stayed on the grass while the car sped down the road. My brother was screaming on the other side asking me if I was okay, but I couldnt open my mouth to tell him that I was fine. My brother checked both sides and raced across the street and helped me up. When we got in our room I finally managed to calm down and told him about the two dark blurs that pushed me out of the way.
He shook his head no at me and told me that right before the car came he saw me jump out of the way just in time. I know I was four at that time, but I knew there was no way I could jump from the middle of the street and into our neighbors lawn across the street.

Fast forward to when I was 13. After my third period class we had a 10 minute break to get water, use the restroom, and eat some snacks. I took out the peanut butter and jelly sandwich my mother made for my snack and started to bite down on it. Midway through my first bite I heard a kid yell in pain right behind me. I turned around to see my bully, Mark, with a pencil lodged into the middle of his hand. I jumped out of my seat and stared at him. He was trying to pull the pencil out, but every time he touched the pencil he would go back to screaming in pain.

The teacher ran up to me and pulled me outside of the class while she called 911. She came back out and told me to sit on the bench by the guidance counselors office until she figured everything out. I waited on the bench for over an hour. During that time I saw three cops and 2 paramedics rush into the room. The cops followed the teacher to the principals office where they could review the cameras. The teacher came back with a puzzled look on her face. She apologized for making me wait for so long and told me to get back to class. Five days later she quit in the middle of class and walked out. She left her notepad on her desk so I scooped it up and went to the restroom.

I opened it up to see a sketch of two dark blurry hands with a bloody pencil in the right hand. Feeling a little creeped out; I just threw the notepad in the trash and decided to try and forget about it.
This is the last occurrence I want to tell you about.

When I just graduated college three of my old high school buddies invited me over to their house to celebrate. I gratefully accepted the invitation and was told to be there the next day at 8pm.
The following day at 6pm I started to drive over there since it took around an hour and thirty minutes. I arrived at 7:45 and knocked on his door. When the door opened I was greeted to the face of my once best friend. He gave me a hug and told me to grab a beer from the fridge.

We were all having a good time. We drank beer, played a couple rounds of beer pong, and started up a movie.

It was all fun until the hands I have only noticed a couple of times started to float in a circle around my head. I tried getting up but the hands just slammed me back down. For the next ten minutes the hands forced me to stay quiet and completely still. When I tried to speak the right hand covered my mouth and suffocated me until the desire to speak went away. Whenever I tried to signal to my friends that something was wrong the hands grabbed me by the wrists and held them down.

This is when the panic started to take over me. With sweat dripping down my forehead I tried to think of a way to get away from the hands. When I couldnt think of a way to get out I started to plea to the hands through my thoughts, but they just wouldnt stop holding me down.

At that moment I felt like I was betrayed by the very thing that saved my life multiple times. I shut my eyes and tried to calm myself down. After a couple of minutes I opened my eyes again only to see that the hands were gone. I looked to my left and right and saw that my friends were still sipping on beer while intently watching the movie. Just as I am about to tell my friends I was going to sleep in the spare bedroom I heard two gunshots from just outside of the house.

My friends and I bolted out of the couch and I was the first to run out the door. I saw two bodies lying on the ground. When I walked up I saw that they each had a gun in their hand. I flipped the first guy over to see that it was a face I didnt really recognize. Hell, I wouldnt have known who it had I not seen the scar in the middle of his hand.

My buddies flipped over the other body and that was the moment I knew that I should never trust anyone. It was my brother. Part of me wanted to feel grief and I did for a second until I found a note in his front pocket.

Once I finished reading it I spit on his face and dialed 911.
It definitely was short and to the point.

Dear Jay,

I wish you hadnt avoided that car.

I wish mom aborted you like she said she would to dad when she 

found out she was pregnant again.

You were a mistake and a burden.

With this bullet I will finally make our family perfect again. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know I am going to be judged very harshly for this, but I really need to tell everyone what I found out yesterday.

Before I let you know what happened I want to give you a little background of my less than admirable hobby. I go around electronic stores and go up to every single clearance laptop. I look up the ip address of each laptop and jot it down in my notebook. 

Then I go home and try every single ip address. I dont check the new ones for a couple of days unless I am out of older ones to try, but mostly I already have some for a couple of weeks before I try them on the Remote Desktop application. I dont do it to steal their credit card information or to expose them. I just do it because I have always been a very curious person. I just want to know what people did on their computers privately. I chose laptops because I knew people never really shut off their laptops so I had a better chance of logging in as long as they didnt have a password.

After 3 years of just finding the slightly awkward web search history to finding my friend and now ex-girlfriend talking shit about me on Facebook messages I started to get slightly bored with it last week.

Yesterday I made my usual run around the three electronic stores around my area and jotted down 4 new ip addresses. When I got home I checked my notebook and realized I was running low on new addresses so I decided to check the four new ones I found after I ate a little dinner. Sometimes laptops have sold within hours after I get home. 

Besides, I really did not feel like working so I called the local convenience store I managed. The assistant manager answered the phone with his usual mock happy customer service voice, but quickly became monotone when he realized it was me on the phone. I told him that I would not be able to come in since I woke up to a horrible headache and sore throat. He grumbled something over the phone, but before he could object I hung up on him. I then called the pizza restaurant famous for *Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.* and ordered 2 pepperoni pizzas with extra cheese. 

I turned on the tv and started to watch people getting ripped off by a pawnshop and waited on my pizza. When the pizza arrived I paid the man and sat down on the couch and devoured the first two slices. While the bald man offered 30 dollars for a 2,000 year old coin my eyes drifted off to the computer. With a feeling of slight excitement I grabbed the two boxes of pizza and walked up to my computer desk.  

While I was eating my third slice of pizza I sat down on my worn down chair and booted up my computer. I double clicked on Remote Desktop Connection, cracked my knuckles while it was starting up, and punched in the 1st ip address while I grabbed my fourth slice. I was highly disappointed when all four ip addresses didnt work so I sat back down and finished off the first pizza. 

I looked through my notebook I wrote the addresses on and made sure all of them were checked off. After going through it once I found 8 I have not tried yet. I had six from over 3 months ago and 2 from my trip last month; so I went back to my computer with my next box of pizza and tried all eight of them. Two of them went through. I looked through the most recent one only to find a person very obsessed with cats. The wallpaper was a picture of a white Persian next to a wine glass, and the photo folder had over 7,000 photos of cats. 

I closed out of the connection and input the one from around 4 months ago. The wallpaper on this desktop was one of the generic ones it was blue and black with the Windows logo in the bottom right edge. I always check the photos first and I opened the folder only to see a blank page. I clicked on videos after and I found 4 video files. They were marked 1a, 2b, 3c, 4d. 

I tried 1A first and grabbed another slice. The first 45 seconds was just complete darkness, but when the camera shifted up I could see that it was a brightly lit room. There was a man who looked to be around his 40s completely naked and tied to a wooden chair. He was crying and snot was dripping down his nose. The whole room was completely white and he was by himself sitting in the middle of the room. About 2 minutes later a woman dressed in a red track suit came in. She was holding a kitchen knife in one hand, and a bottle of vodka in the other. The closer she got to him the more the man struggled to get out of his chair. I saw his wrists start to bleed where he had been tugging so hard. When she was in front of him she grabbed his right thigh and cut a chunk of flesh from the top of his thigh to the knee cap. 

He still stayed remarkably composed after losing a large portion of flesh, but his composure crumpled when she started to pour the bottle of vodka onto his legs. I didnt have the audio turned on, but I could feel his scream creeping into my very soul.

I could see the look of desperation on his face and the pain in his eyes. She took of a ring from her left hand and shoved the diamond straight into his chest. She then shoved the thigh flesh down the knife as if she were making a demented kebab; after admiring her twisted art she drove the knife in the mans heart and walked out leaving him dying on the chair.

I have been one to easily stomach in violence, but the video automatically made me start to panic a little bit inside. I passed B2 and clicked C3. 

The setting was in a small house in the middle of the woods. A van pulled up to the house and a small boy hopped out of the sliding van door. A man came out carrying a big red hunk of meat. A woman hopped out of the driver seat. As the boy walked up to the camera he smiled from ear to ear and waved at the camera. He then walked up to his father and helped him chop off the hands and feet of what seemed like the skinned body of a man and threw them in the fire the mother started. They tore out the intestines and threw it in the pot that was on top of the fire and then started to chop the mans body into smaller chunks. Once they were done they threw the contents in to the pot. Ten minutes later the boy walked up to the pot and dunked his spoon in to the human broth. Once he took a sip he smiled and nodded at his father. Before anything else happened I turned the video off and sat in silence as the need to throw up became apparent.

The video made me absolutely sick to my stomach. I threw the slice of pizza back in the box and retched in front of my trash can. I didnt move until I was absolutely sure I wouldnt throw up. When I went back on the screen I exited out of the video section immediately and was about to close down the program until I saw a word document titled My Contribution

I opened the document and saw My Contribution and then a list afterwards. The first part of the list stopped me in my tracks as my brother was coming on the 19th of January for his winter break, and the name was unmistakably mine.  

1) See Toweyinger Brown on January 19, 2017.

 2) Tie James Taylor to his bed while he is sleeping.

 3) Cut off his right leg and then left leg. 

 4) Stitch his legs next to my legs.

 5) Cut his arms off and stitch them on my hips. 

 6) If he is not dead yet slice his neck and give him a hug.

 7) Look at the camera and tell them you are now closer to your brother.

The memory of my mother buying my brother a new laptop 3 months ago after he broke his last one hit me at that moment. Of course she bought him a clearance laptop. She had always liked store bought items, but she always made sure she found the best deals.

My brother and I have always been close. I just havent talked to him much in the last couple of years due to the difference in our schedules. He would message me occasionally, but I would always forget to reply. I kept missing his calls and forget to call back. The last time he came here on his summer break he joked around that he would find a way to make us closer, but I guess he was actually being serious.

<TITLE> I Didn't Even Want To Learn How To Play The Piano </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-15 15:11:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was 14 years old my mother fell in love with Classical music. It started with Tchaikovsky playing from her portable Walkman to her blasting Bach in the kitchen cd player. I never cared for the music, but I knew how much she loved it so I always made it seem like I was just as interested in classical music as she was. 

Every morning I woke up to sound of classical music and to the smell of bacon. When I walked into the kitchen I would see my mother dancing while she cooked my breakfast. Those were one of the few moments I would truly share the same love my mother had for classical music. There is something about soft music playing in the background while stuffing my mouth with my mothers extra greasy pancakes and butter toast I loved so much.

I never found a problem with my mothers passion until four men lugged a piano into our living room. My mother brought out three beginner piano books out of her purse I knew that I was screwed. She already knew how to play the piano pretty well, and the only person that would need these books was me. Once the men left she tapped on the piano bench so I reluctantly walked up and sat down.

From then on my mother started to teach me how to play the piano. 

I never wanted to play any type of instrument so I decided to act like I was completely un-teachable. Whenever she told me how to play a certain note I would always hit the next key over. When I sensed that she was getting upset I would plant my face into my hands and complain about how difficult it was for me. No matter what I did she would still make me sit on the piano bench with her for 2 hours a day.

We would continuously practice the same song over and over again until she lost her patience. This was now a part of my schedule and I was about to just start actually trying. Two months later I was coming back home after school. I had decided that today was the day that I would start trying to learn how to play the piano. 

When I got home I found a random red sedan in our driveway. When I walked into the door I saw a very uninterested woman sitting on our couch. She had short black hair, looked to be around her mid 30s, and a permanent scowl on her face. 

The woman looked up at me and tried her best to produce a smile; only to show me the best example of what a fake smile looks like. 

I took a seat beside my mother on the piano bench and smiled back at the woman. She told me her name was Ms. Wilson and she is my new piano tutor. She lives 4 houses down from us so she expects me to be at her hour 5 p.m. on the dot every Monday and Friday. 

Once the woman left around an hour later my mother explained to me that she was tired of feeling like she was being a drawback on my passion for music. So she looked around for a piano tutor we would be able to afford. The lady down the street contacted her yesterday telling her she would be able to teach me for 30 dollars a week. Once my mother heard that she used to perform for our town symphony 10 years ago she automatically accepted the offer. 

Three days later I went up to Ms. Wilsons house and knocked on her door. When Ms. Wilson opened the door I did a very visible double take. She looked completely different. Ms. Wilson was smiling a genuine smile and wearing a simple red skirt. She looked like she was 15 years younger than what she was and when she greeted me with a hug I felt a feeling of unease take over my body.

When she hugged me I knew for a fact that her hand grazed my butt, but I just figured it was on accident. She grabbed my right shoulder and guided me to her piano. It was in her living room but it was placed at an awkward place. The piano keys were facing the couch and the piano bench was right on the wall. 

When I took my seat I noticed that my back was right on the wall and I was facing the couch. Ms. Wilson took her seat on the couch and told me to take out my piano book and play the song I have been having difficulty on. 

I tried my very hardest and played the whole song with only two mistakes. I only made those mistakes because I noticed that every page I played perfectly Ms. Wilsons legs would start shaking up and down harder and harder, but when I made my first mistake I noticed that she would stop shaking her leg and start staring at me intently.

Once I finished the song she walked up to me and stared down at me. She started to stroke my forehead with her index and middle finger. In the softest voice I have ever heard she said Youre a fucking failure. I looked up at her and asked her what she said, but when I blinked my eyes I noticed she was back on her couch giving me a slow clap. She told me I only messed up twice and that with only a little bit of practice I would have this song down perfectly. 

After the lesson I went back home and told my mother what I thought she said. With a chuckle my mother told me that I probably heard her wrong and asked me to play the song we worked on. I played the song without a mistake and saw a huge smile spread across my mothers face. I knew that learning how to play the piano was a great gift for her so I continued to go to Ms. Wilsons house twice a week for my lessons. 

That Monday she sat on the bench with me while I practiced a new song. Every page I played right she would stroke my thighs, and with every wrong note I would feel a sharp pain in my leg. I knew she was pinching me, but I really just wanted her to stop rubbing me. 

After my lesson I played the new song I learned from my mother and she was even happier with the results. I wanted to stop learning how to play the piano from Ms. Wilson so I decided that from now on after my lessons I would completely butcher the song my mother asked me to play after my lesson. 

When the next Monday came Ms. Wilson opened the door before I knocked on her door. She was wearing a short black skirt and told me to come in for my lesson. I went inside and took my seat on the bench. She took her seat on the couch and watched me as I played. This time I played the new song without a single mistake. I closed my eyes while I played as I had memorized the song and only opened them when I had finished the song.

I heard the sound of Ms. Wilsons voice saying Bravo Excellent and Perfection! I looked at her only to find that she had taken her shirt and bra off to reveal her rib bones poking out of her midsection. Her chest was now a mixture of mashed up flesh and crushed up bones around her slowly beating heart. With every clap her face started to fall apart more and more. Her nose slid down to her chin and her eyes have started to melt out of the sockets. The skin on her cheeks started to peel off only to reveal rotting flesh underneath. 

That is when I bolted out of the bench and ran out of her door. 

I didnt stop running until I got into the front door of my house. 

I used my key to open the door, but the door wouldnt budge. 

After about 30 seconds of frantically knocking on the door a man answered the door with a confused look on his face; I screamed at him Who the fuck are you? Where the hell is my mother? 

With a surprised look on his face he took out his cellphone and called the police while going into our old laundry room.

I caught a couple of sentences, but I couldnt hear everything. 

Missing kid. 4 years ago. I do not see his mother. He is very confused. I dont know, maybe around 18 to 20.

Today has been three days since I ran out of Ms. Wilsons house. Ms. Wilson was found dead in her house. They say that she has been dead for the past 2 years. She died of a heart attack, and I have been missing for the past 4 years. My mother disappeared the same day I did. 

I was found, but my mother is [still missing] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TITLE> I Regret Winning the Lottery With My Three Brothers </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-15 01:48:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Three years ago I won the lottery, and within 4 months later I learned to never trust anyone. My three brothers (Jerry, Paul, and Joseph) and I won the Power Ball lottery. We claimed it as anonymous, and split the 399.4 million dollars between the three of us. Of course, after taxes we took away around 71 million dollars each. 

Every week for 10 years we had been throwing in 50 dollars a person; some weeks we would win a couple of hundred dollars but others we would make a couple of dollars. Despite losing money, we would still throw in the same 50 dollars week after week without a second thought. The very hope that someday we might be able to just live comfortably without having a job was more than enough motivation for us; so that is why we never gave up or gave the fifty dollar expense a second thought.

We started the lottery pool when I was 24 years old. It became a thing one Christmas morning when we all realized that we were spending around 300 dollars a month on lottery tickets already. Before you judge all of us, I want you to know that since we were all very young our father spent almost all of his paycheck lottery tickets. We captured that same passion, but luckily for us, it was in a moderate way. 

Joseph and I have always been the closest since Paul and Jerry were both more than 7 years older than me. Joseph and I only had a 2 year gap between us. It meant that we argued and fought the most, but at the end of the day we never complained about having to share a bunk bed with each other. No matter how much we argued that day we would still talk to each other until we fell asleep every single night.  

We were the ones that actually got everything set up for the lottery pool, and he was the one that convinced Jerry and Paul to join in so that we could have a better chance. 

We made a couple of simple rules for in case we won and how we would go about getting the tickets.

1)	We always used randomized numbers. (Chance above luck)

2)	We would buy the tickets in turn based system. (Jerry, Joseph, Paul, then me)

3)	No matter who turned in the numbers; we would always split the winnings 25%,

4)	If someone was unable to participate that week they would not be involved with the winnings.

For 10 years we were facing constant failure. The most we won was around 1200 dollars, but if you added up all of the money we had spent until then it felt like we were just throwing our money away. For some reason we still kept doing it without any sort of hesitation. The person that was in charge for that week to purchase the tickets always found the 50 dollars from each person. 

Ten years later I went into the convenience store that was right by my house and purchased the 200 Quick-Pic lottery tickets. That Wednesday I sat in front of the tv while the numbers were being called. I wrote the numbers on a notepad and scanned through every single ticket. When I found one ticket that matched every single number and in the right order I stared at the two pieces of paper. I checked the ticket over a hundred times just to make sure that the ticket I was holding in my hand was the impossible goal my brothers and I were shooting for.

I called all of them within 10 minutes, and before an hour all of them were standing in front of me staring at the lottery ticket. Paul asked me if I was pranking them, but I convinced him that I really wasnt. Jerrys whole body was shaking with what seemed like absolute excitement, and Joseph walked up to me and gave me a hug while telling me that all of our lives will finally get better.

We all decided that the Cash option would be the best for us to split it equally, and once we got the cash the first thing we did was split four ways on a new house for our mother and father. I have never seen my mother and father so happy than the day that we surprised them to their new house. My father fell into tears while trying to explain how much it meant to him while my mother gave each of us hugs while telling us how great we were to them.

With all of the newfound money life was great to me until a month and a half later when Paul was found floating on his outdoor pool. His neck was sliced opened with the head of a rubber duck poking out of his open neck. 

Joseph came over to my house the next day to deliver the news, and when I heard about it I just wanted to cry over the loss of Paul. We may not have been close, but he was the one that always made sure we did our homework and made good decisions. Every time any of us thought about doing something reckless Paul wouldnt try to stop us, but he would try to talk to us and tell us what we thought about doing was absolutely foolish. 

The paranoia didnt really sink in until the death of Jerry 2 months later. He was found in the middle of our local park clutching a rubber duck. His stomach was ripped open with both of his feet stuck into his midsection. He had been dead for 8 hours until someone noticed that there was a dead body on the park bench. 

The day after Jerrys dead body was found on the park bench I noticed that Joseph had stopped talking to me all together. Just to make sure I texted him over 10 times and called him 3 times, but I did not get a response. 

I remembered playing with ducks with Joseph in the bathtub when we were younger and took baths together. I remember that Jerry and Paul would always make fun of us for playing with such childish toys in the bath, but we were never affected by their taunts. 

I didnt want to think it was Joseph actually killing both of our brothers, but I did not really have any other person to blame. I know I didnt do it, and I know that we claimed the lottery winnings anonymously so all of my worry was on Joseph.

I know that we were family, but you dont know what people will do for that extra bit of money. We all had more than enough money to live off of, but obviously Joseph didnt think it was enough for him.

For the next two weeks I double checked everything I did and everywhere I went. I was filled with paranoia since I knew that Joseph knew where I usually liked to go and what I liked to do. I kept staying vigilant until yesterday.

Yesterday, I woke up to the news of Josephs death. He was found a knife cut from his neck to the bottom of his midsection. The bottom half of a rubber duck was stapled to his stomach and the top half of the rubber duck was sewn over his lips. 

There were two words cut into his forehead. Little Ducky 

When I heard the news of his death my blood ran cold, and I found myself filling with an overwhelming sense of panic.

[That is exactly what my mother used to call us] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TITLE> I Now Know Why My Best Friend Acted Creepy </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-13 16:16:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have always been a scrawny person since I was in elementary school. Granted due to my semi decent sense of humor I was never bullied, but to the opposite sex I was never deemed attractive or dateable. Friendzone was the nation I inhabited and until the age of 25 I was completely fine with it. Of course, I craved the attention when it came time for the homecoming dance or prom, but I always managed to get a friend that went with me out of pity. 

After high school I went to a local college and graduated 5 years later. I ran out of funds so I worked in sales after my sophomore year to make enough money for my last two years. On my graduation day I looked back on the years I spent in college and immediately felt regret. Every day after my classes I would just go back home and eat dinner with my parents and go to my bedroom where I would spend the whole night surfing the web and reading. I made a couple of friends and had a date that ended terribly, but I just felt like I never truly utilized college for all of its worth. I was accepted into an out of state college, but I decided against it because I did not want to get out of my comfort zone.

After college I tried to find a job that went along with my major (English), and found that it is pretty much impossible to get a teaching job in the town I lived in. After four months of looking for a job I decided that any job was as good as any and went to the local Electronics store for my old job back. 

The manager was more than happy to take me back as I was the top seller every month I was there. I dont like to go out and make friends, but I was definitely good at making people spend their money. When I came back for my first day back 3 days later I realized that it was a completely different crew except the manager. There were three salesmen (Mack, Vance, and Jonathan) and the manager (Anthony). Before I came back in Mack was the top salesman for the past 6 months and we automatically did not like each other. Vance was the lowest salesman, but he always cleaned the store up and made sure all of the inventory was correct. Jonathan was the middle tier salesman, and we became fast friends. 

There really isnt much to talk about the world of sales. People come in looking for X object and we sell them X object while trying to add on accessories. Sometimes we would get them to loosen on their original budget and go for a higher end model. That is about as far as sales really go to me. It gets me a paycheck and I can pay the rent my mother and father suddenly started charging me. 

Three weeks into working there Jonathan asked if I wanted to come over to his house to hang out and drink a couple of beers. I agreed and after work we went there and turned on a couple of movies while downing beer after beer. After about 3 hours I decided it was time for me to go home, but Jonathan rationalized with me about the dangers of driving drunk. He brought out 2 pillows and a blanket. He pointed at the couch and I sat back down. He put the blanket and pillows beside me and told me goodnight while he walked back to his room.

I dont know when I fell asleep, but I remember snapping awake. I have this thing ever since I was young where I would slightly open my eyes in case its already bright, but I found the room to be completely dark. I slightly glanced up trying to figure out where I was but what I saw made me close my eyes completely and start shaking a little. Jonathan was standing in the hallway while staring at me. I waited about 10 minutes and slightly opened my eyes once more to see that he was going back into his room. 

The next morning I woke up to the smell of bacon. I quickly got out of bed and went into his kitchen. He was cooking and looking like his normal self so I just let my paranoia slide off and I asked him if he needed any help. With a wave of his hand he just told me to sit down and enjoy my hangover. I sat down on the couch until he was done cooking and we ate bacon and pancakes. We went to work right after breakfast, and by the end I completely forgot about him staring at me in the middle of the night.

The next weekend he asked me if I wanted to go out to a club an hour away from us and without a hesitation I told him yes. I told him I would wear my black suit to look extra spiffy, and while laughing he told me he would pick me up from my house at 10 pm. Around 1015 I heard him honking and I went outside and got into his car. When I saw him I had to take a double take. He was wearing the same exact thing as me. Black suit and a white button up shirt; I just decided to ignore it. 

We got to the club at 11, right as the doors were opening, and before it was midnight I was having the time of my life. For the first time in my life I was meeting girls that seemed to take an interest in me, and I even got to dance with a couple of them. The only thing that really threw me off was that Jonathan seemed to be staring down every single girl that even gave me a slight bit of interest. 

At 2 Jonathan came up to me and told me that it was time to go home so I went to the bar to pay off my tab. 

While I was paying my tab a girl that I danced with earlier came up to me and slipped a piece of paper in my pocket while giving me a light peck on my cheek. I know I blushed, but I maintained my composure enough to give her a wink and a little smile.

When I got into the car I took out the piece of paper and showed Jonathan. Nearly bouncing in my seat with my excitement I told him that she was definitely a girl that I would not mind dating. He asked me what she looked like so I told him that she was a little shorter than me, brown hair, and green eyes. Then I started to explain to him how pretty she was, but I noticed that he had changed his expression from happiness to what seemed like anger. The whole car ride was filled with awkward silences and sideway glances from Jonathan.

I felt like he had gotten a bit too weird for me so I started to avoid him at work. It worked for the first 3 days, but I noticed that he had started to follow me around. When I was driving home I would see his car from a distance away. Sometimes when I was lying in my bed I would spot a set of eyes coming from the set of trees in front of my house, but every single time I would walk up to the window I would see the eyes vanish. I didnt really know it was him until I saw a figure with bright green shoes run down the street. 

I know Jonathan is the only person I have ever seen wear bright green shoes. They were the shoes he wore whenever he went out running or whenever he exercised. 

I decided that the next day would be the best day to just approach him and tell him that I noticed him following me after work and looking into my window. I was going to tell my only and best friend that I would really appreciate it if he could just give me some space until I thought he was back to normal. 

That next day the store was closed. The store was closed because Jonathan was found in the middle of the night by the police with a giant gaping hole in his chest. His heart was removed and placed in his mouth. Where his heart should have been was a credit card from our store. The magnetic strip was rubbed off, and the name and card number was grinded off. On his stomach was a series of cuts to reveal a little note. 
 
Was it worth the sale?

I know I wanted him to give me some space, but I never wanted him to die. He was my only best friend, and the grief that filled my heart when my manager called and told me the news caused me to hang up on him and fall on my bed. With deep sobs I felt like the world was crashing down on me, and I never felt like he ever knew how much he really meant to me. 

Today is the day after Jonathan was found dead. I decided to go to the mall to clear my head.

I went outside to my car and found a letter stuck in my window. 

I grabbed the letter and read it in my car.

Hey subject8631,

Im sure youve noticed that I have been following you around, and that I have been acting weird around you. 

I know on the first night you spent the night over you saw me staring at you on the couch. 

I just want you to know that on the first week Mack convinced an older woman to make an $8100 tv purchase using our store credit card. 

The next day the woman came back with the tv. It had a big crack in the middle of the screen, but she told us all that it had come that way. Normally, we just return it and get our money back from the manufacturer, but Mack did not want to lose out on the commission. It was the last one we had in stock and he wanted to have an upper hand on you. 

She started to beg and plea to just take the tv back and let her buy a cheaper model. She told him that she didnt even have the money to pay the monthly bill. He just told her she was out of luck and made her take the tv back into her car. 

That night she killed herself. She was clutching a remote in her left hand and an empty bottle of pills in her right hand. 

The daughter came in 3 days later. It was your off day, but Mack was there. She went up to him and told him about the death of her mother. She didnt seem sad, but I could tell she was not here to ask about what can be done with the bill. With a smile she asked who the salesman was and the mother fucker told her it was you and described what you looked like. With a smile she skipped out the door and drove off in her red sedan.

When you spent the night I woke up to the sound of a car engine starting up around 2 am. I looked out the window and saw that same red sedan. When we were going to the club I saw the red sedan following us. When you described to me about the girl that gave you her number it matched what she looked like exactly. I just wanted to make sure you were safe so I followed you home and I kept watch over you.

Tonight I invited her over. I took the paper she wrote you her number on and texted her. She said she will be here at 2 am. I know I may not be alive when you read this, but I want you to know that I love you man. I know we havent been friends for long, but just know that I acted like a creep around you because I wanted to make sure [you were safe]  (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks)

<TEXT> When I heard the sound of my alarm going off I thought I hit snooze and fell back asleep again. About 1 hour later I bolted out of bed and checked the time. As soon as I saw that it was 8:45 I started to panic as it would be the 5th time I am late in the past month. I dont know why, but I just developed this habit of accidentally hitting Dismiss instead of Snooze. I know I should get up when I hear the alarm, but old habits really do die hard.

I rushed out of bed and texted my manager telling him Im sorry, but Im going to be about 15 minutes late today. I went into my bathroom and just threw some gel on my hair and got quickly dressed. About 5 minutes later I was in my car and on the road. Luckily, I was only about 8 minutes late so I knew it wouldnt be a huge deal.  I took off my shoes as soon as I got in threw on my slippers, (My company is big about keeping their floors clean) and scanned my finger on a security pad that is next to the door. When I heard the door unlock on my third try I rushed to the second floor and took my seat in the office. 

Usually we have a couple of people talking amongst each other while working on their projects, but today everyone in the office was quiet as they typed away on their computers. I checked my e-mails to see if there was any huge project that we suddenly got over the weekend, but I hadnt received any new e-mails since Friday. I walked into our break area and got a cup of coffee; when I walked back I noticed that Jim was writing extremely fast on a piece of paper. I glanced at his paper only to see a jumbled mass of scribbles everywhere. He stopped what he was doing when he noticed me staring and looked up at me with a blank stare. 

After a couple of seconds of awkward silence Jim finally said in the most monotone voice I think you should go back to your desk Greg. I nodded at him and quickly went back to my seat, and started to work on my project. I dont know what was wrong with Jim, but this guy really needs to work on his attitude. The more I sit in my chair working on my project the more I get mad at how Jim talked to me. I mean he just started 2 months ago. Im the one that is leading the project hes working on. What gave him the right to talk to me like that?

When I felt like I couldnt hold my anger any longer I got out of my chair and into my managers office. I knocked on the door and he told me to come in. When I walked in I saw that he was holding a letter opener in his left hand and a bottle of wine in his right hand. I started to tell him about how Jim just talked to me, and as his superior I felt like it was completely uncalled for. As I was ranting I saw the manager blankly stare at me as he kept trying to open the wine bottle with the letter opener. He stuck the letter opener in the cork finally and started to wiggle the letter opener around. When I finished speaking he put all of his attention on opening his wine bottle.

After about 3 minutes of trying with the letter opener he threw it on the ground and held the wine bottle with both of his hands. He brought his mouth the tip of the bottle and started to bite it as hard as he could.  With his fourth bite I heard a sharp crack and saw specks of blood splatter on his white desk. He spit the glass piece out of his mouth along with the tip of his tongue in the trash can beside his desk. He looked back at me and finally said in the same exact voice Jim used on me Jims right Greg, go back to your desk. I started to complain that I had no idea why Jim even thought he had the authority to talk to me like that, but my manager slammed his hand on his desk and glared at me. Go back to your desk Greg. Jim is right. Jim is right. So you need to go back to your desk. You need to be at your desk right now. Jim knows what is best. 

As blood started to drip out of his mouth and onto his shirt I asked him if he was okay, but he ignored my concerns and turned his chair around. I begged him to just call a doctor, but he refused to say a single word to me as he brought up the bottle and took a loud swig. I started to panic, but I left his office and walked towards my desk.

I kept trying to reassure myself that everything was completely normal, and that there wasnt anything for me to worry about. I started to feel better, but that only lasted a second. Every single desk I passed on my way back to my own desk I noticed that everyone was working furiously, but what they were doing made zero sense to me. One was just placing stamps all over the computer monitor, and another person was grabbing the phone and tapping random numbers without making a call. Mark, who has been a good friend of mine since I started working here, was continuously tapping the power button on his computer tower, and Jeff, who I hated, was on a word document typing complete nonsense. 

When I reached my desk I started to feel panic set in as I had no idea what the hell was going on, but I just brought up my project and tried my hardest to ignore everything going on and just get some work done. 

I was starting to get into my project when I noticed something. Everything was completely silent in the office. I looked up and the blood drained from my face; every single one of our 33 employees was staring at me. I tried asking what was wrong, but everyone started chanting in unison Stay in your seat Greg. Just work and dont get up.

Right at that moment I decided to just say screw it to the job, and went straight for the doors. Mark and Jim got up and stood in front of the doors, but I just barreled past them and went downstairs. I pressed the button on the side of the door and when it unlocked I kicked my slippers off and put on my shoes. 

I ran to my car and drove home as fast as I could. 

When I got home I took my phone out of my glove compartment to find a text message from my manager.

Greg you do know that today is a holiday right? Dont come in unless you want to work by yourself all day!

That message was sent to me 5 minutes after I ran into work.

Since I cant use my cell phone at work I really need to remember which days are holidays, because I know that I was not [working alone] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> The Last Trip To My Closed Down High School </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-11 14:54:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yesterday my aunt died, and immediately I felt in my heart a gap that will never be filled again. My mother and father left me with them whenever they found the opportunity to make money; so I was stuck with my aunt and uncle for most of my childhood. So even now I see my aunt and uncle as more of my parents than anybody else. As soon as I received the news of her death I immediately told my boss to give me the next three days off and I drove two states over. On the ride there I turned on all of the songs we used to sing together whenever we went on long drives while I silently sobbed.

When I was close by I decided to drive by my old high school to try and recapture some old memories. As I got closer I noticed that something was off. It was 2:30 pm and that is usually the time that the school day ends, but no matter where I looked I did not see a single car driving away from the high school. When I arrived I knew why. My old high school has been shut down. I feel a small bit of grief since the building that introduced me to my first crush, my first best friend, and my absolute favorite teacher has now become a slab of concrete that held lost and forgotten memories. 

I sadly got back into my car and drove to my aunts house. As soon as I arrived I saw that there were several cars in her driveway. When I walked in the door the first thing I saw was the sight of my defeated uncle sipping on a glass of whisky while sitting in the sofa he has had for 20 years. Then I saw a bored looking man talking to my uncle about the debt that she had left him. My uncle was nodding as he was pretending to listen, but I know that my uncle never really cared about being in debt. Of course, everything else my aunt had was now his, but he still refused to give the lawyer any of his attention.

I walked up to my uncle and placed my hand on his shoulder.

As soon as he saw that he was me he smiled his 5 tooth smile and said I just knew you would come! I kept telling everyone you would come, but everyone told me you would be too busy to come, but I told everyone that you would be here for me and your mother. Though my uncle had fallen victim to mild Dementia he had always known that I would forever call him and his wife my mother and father. 

After we are done talking I walk to the kitchen and sit down as I revisit all of my older memories of my aunt cooking pancakes for me while she sang the little songs she loved so much, and how she would hold my hands telling me that I would always be something great. Feeling the need to cry again I went upstairs and in to my old bedroom. Seeing that everything was where it was the day I left made me break out into a sob once again. 

In the middle of my sobbing I slammed on the right corner of my bed and felt something hard. Only when I am done sobbing did I un-flip my covers and see my old high school yearbook laying there from when I was looking over it the day before I went to college. I was reminded that my old high school was now shut down, and before I became even more depressed I decided to do the most reckless thing I have ever done.

I am going to break into my high school.

When my uncles grandfather clock alerted me that it was midnight by ringing three times I hopped out of my bed and snuck outside. I got into my car and drove to my old high school. 

I noticed that the third window on the right side of the building was slightly opened earlier so that was the first place I checked. When I walked up to the window I felt a sudden rush of adrenaline.

It was still opened.

I raised the window and slowly slid my body in. 

As soon as I got into the room I recognized it completely. It was where I took my Spanish class my senior year. The teacher of the class was Mrs. Gomez and she was my absolute favorite teacher. I have never met a more patient person than her, and she always talked in a way that you would just want to pay attention the whole class. When I first came into the class I was struggling with the Spanish language, but with her patience and perseverance I quickly became one of her star pupils.

After a couple of minutes I left the room and walked down the hallways. I stopped in front of my old locker and put in my old combination. I was surprised when it opened, but realized that it was completely empty.

I went up to the first door on the left after the lockers ended and found myself in my old gymnasium. This is where I saw the face of my first crush the first time. While I was thinking about how she made fun of me in front of the whole history class for having a crush on her I heard a slam from the other side of the gym. I froze in fear for what felt like an eternity, but the sound of the second slam jolted me out of my paralyzed state. I didnt bother seeing what could have made the sounds. Instead I decided to get out of the gym as fast as I possibly could. When I was around 3 steps away I felt my feet jerking behind me as I fell forward. I have never been a clumsy person, and I knew for a fact I fell from what felt like something literally grabbing me by the ankles. My mouth landed on the corner of a book, and I felt one of my front teeth snapping in half in the process. I looked down to see a corner of a diary. 

On the cover of the diary was the name of my first best friend. The name Mike Stallworth was written on the cover, but when I looked on the first page I found myself staring at a blank page. I kept flipping until I got to the middle where a single sentence was written. You have forgotten about me. I grabbed the diary and tossed it to the other side of the gym and ran out. When I got to the room I entered through I realized the window was now shut. I tried opening every single window in the room but none of them would budge. 

I ran to the next room and tried the windows only to get the same exact result. For the next 30 minutes I ran around the school like a madman trying every single window and every single door, but did not find a single way out. I tried calling out from my phone, but every single call I tried to make failed to connect. 

So I ran into the restroom I used to go to every morning to meet with my best friend and trade our snacks we got for lunch. He always got a Snak Pak and I always got a Fruit Roll Up. Right when I ran in I felt the temperature around me start to feel like a mixture of hot and cold. I started to feel like I was suffocating, but I never truly ran out of breath. I ran into the second stall and sat on the toilet. 

I sat on the toilet for around 30 minutes, and I felt a sudden sense of calm so I walked out of the stall. I looked in the mirror and stopped dead in my tracks. I saw the face of Mike with his tongue hanging to the middle of his neck. His face was deathly pale and his shoulders were rising up and falling back down as he took every single breath. 

I turned around to avoid looking at his face, but I started to feel warm air brush across my neck. I turned to my right, but I saw there was nothing there. Then I decided to once again look in the mirror. It was Mike waving goodbye at me as he clutched the fruit roll up in his right hand. He was still smiling five minutes later when I entered into the restroom with three other boys. 

He stopped smiling when one of the boys grabbed him by the neck and slammed his face into the mirror or when he was punched in the face repeatedly while all five of us laughed. Yes, even I laughed so I could start to fit in with the others. At that time I thought Mike was holding me back, but he was the one that made me into the man that I am. 

After we left him lying on the ground I saw him pulling out his blood pressure pills. I saw him fill up the sink to the brim. I saw him put all of the pills in his mouth and dunk his head into the waters.

I saw him die. 

When his body stopped moving I heard a creak coming from the distance.

I looked back in the mirror and was met with the reflection of a heartless bitch that let his 18 year old best friend get to the point to where he just wanted to end his life. 

I opened the restroom door and went to the room with my Spanish teacher. I found that the window was now opened. 

I slid through the window and went to my car. When I looked back at the school I saw that it was gone. 

It was just an open plot of land, but I know why I had to go.

Mike needed to let me know that he never forgot, and I can never [forget] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> Watch what you smoke </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-11 11:38:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Currently, I am holding 5 pounds of maybe the most potent weed I have ever encountered. What am I doing with it? Im throwing that shit in to the bonfire I just made. A bonfire that consists of 4 pallets and 28 pieces of logs and a gallon of gasoline; you may be wondering why I am getting rid of $8500 dollars of product and I will tell you why. I just want to give you the background of what I do first.


I am a college dropout. I did really well my freshmen year, but decided halfway through my second year that college wasnt right for me. I got into the world of car sales, and I did really well the two years I worked there. I have smoked since high school and I never plan on quitting, and I have always bought it from my best friend since High School. One day I went over to my buddys house (Jay) and I bought an eighth off of him. When he was handing me the baggie he asked me So how much do you make a month man? I told him I made around $2900 a month. He scoffed and put his arm around me and told me to quit my job. 


Of course, I didnt quit my job right at that moment, but that same week our old manager quit and a new asshole manager took his place. Four days into the week he yelled at me for selling an old lady a used car instead of a brand new car so I just walked out and drove straight to Jays house. He invited me in with a knowing smile and from then on we became official business partners. I had 15k saved up and he had all of the connections. 


Within 6 months made 15k turn into 75k. Even though we have made a significant profit from my money we both felt like we should be making more at a faster rate so we started to branch out to other dealers with bigger quantities. We stopped selling anything smaller than half an ounce and with that strategy we started to make a lot more money. 


Four days ago Jay called me at 3 am and I groggily answered the phone. He told me that someone just gave him word that they just received in the best shit they have ever smoked, and that they would sell it to us at 1700 a pound. As soon as I heard the price I jumped out of bed and got dressed.  I picked Jay up from his house and he handed me a piece of paper with an address scribbled on it. 


I drove 35 minutes and when we arrived I had to double check to make sure we had the right address. For the past 9 months I was accustomed to going into rundown houses with a door always semi opened, but the house that we drove up to was a 3 story mansion with a gate in the front. We pulled up to the gate and Jay told me to press the Call button. As soon as I pressed it a voice asked who we were. Jay cleared his throat and said Jay, Im here for pickup. 


Before he could say anything else the gate opened up and I drove through the gates.


I pulled in about halfway past the gates so we wouldnt somehow get trapped and walked up to the front door. Jay held up a hand to knock, but before he could a man opened the door. He was in a simple t-shirt and shorts and looked to be about 24. 


He didnt say a single word. He just held out his hand. Jay took out 17k from his backpack and placed it on his hands. The man closed the door and came back out less than 10 seconds later holding 10 sacks of weed. As soon as he opened the door I felt the smell of absolute skunk hit me in the face. It literally brought tears to my eyes. We grabbed 5 bags each and threw it in my trunk. 


When we got home we were the most excited we had been in a long time. We didnt smoke any because we always had one single rule. We would not smoke any of our weed until we got near the end so that we can take in all of the profit before enjoying the product. So basically, whenever we start running out of one batch we can just smoke the remaining 2 ounces we have left over. It usually took us around 10 days to sell 5 pounds so the 10 pounds we bought would take around 20 days.


For the next three days we were selling the new batch faster than we have ever sold before. Within the 3 days we had sold 4 pounds and people kept coming back for more. The name Dizzy Melon caught on rather quickly so we started calling it Dizzy Melon too. 


The problem actually started this morning. We thought it was strange when we didnt have a single person come in even though it was already 1 pm. Jay already made a blunt with the Dizzy Melon and said we might as well try it, but I declined. I respect our rule, but I dont blame Jay for being curious about it. After he smoked the blunt we walked down the street where a guy that came by for a pick-up almost every day lived. When we got there he was being carted by paramedics. I fell to the ground when I saw the condition he was in. Half of his fingers looked to be completely chewed off while the other half were a mixture of mashed up meat and crushed up bones. They were hanging off his hands like defeated worms. His midsection has been torn into and some of his intestines were hanging out of his body and onto the gurney. 


We started running back to our house, but just before we got out of earshot the guy yelled out It lives inside of you. Once you smoke it. It wont fucking leave! We could hear his laughter even when we went inside Jays house. 


I turned on Jays tv as soon as we got in and put the news on. There have been 38 cases of self mutilation throughout our city, and I could recognize every single one of their faces from the last couple of days. 


I told Jay I was going to go home and think about what we should do about the weed, and he just grunted in response. 


I took the weed and went home. 


Three hours ago Jay was taken to the hospital. He damaged his midsection far too much to survive. My best friend since high school is dead all because of Dizzy Melon. 


So now I am standing in front of the glorious bonfire I made in my backyard. I plan to throw it in the fire and run right back into my house. I have a facemask on and I will hold my breath.


Im just here to warn everyone.


If you hear about a new strain of weed that smells far better than any weed you have ever smoked, and if that weed is far cheaper than the prices you are used to paying.


Dont fucking smoke [it] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

<TITLE> A Man Has Been Standing In Front Of The Same Urinal For Over 4 Hours </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-10 06:18:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I want to start off by saying that I have worked at the same job for 14 years. It is a great job where I just sit at the desk and make sure the e-mails that are sent out by us are readable and professional sounding. I kind of fell on to the job since my mother knew the CEO of the company, and since then I have moved up to a manager position with extremely good pay and great benefits. Alright, since you asked I make a little over 120k a year and my benefits include, all health, 30 vacation days (paid), and an apartment that the company pays monthly for. 

All in all, I simply couldnt be more content with where I am at in life. Ive never been married, but Im only 33 and it is the last thing that concerns me. I have had a couple of relationships here and there, but after a couple of months the love goes sour, and I begin to lose interest. Anyways, out of that semi-depressing topic and onto the more fun part. I live in one of the Eastern States, but I really dont want to tell you exactly which one. My apartment has a beautiful ocean side view, and I love drinking my coffee while I watch the waves go back and forth. I remember just 14 years ago when I was just a college drop-out and walking along side this very beach. Trying to find the nearest cheap food vendor so I could spend the last 5 dollars on something to fill my starving stomach.

Now I am staring down at that very spot I walked on and smiling to myself thinking of how lucky I am to have such a great mother. I give my mother a call every morning to tell her that I love her, and make sure she is doing fine. When she was 62 she decided to go live in a retirement village so that she could be with people around her age. I miss having her around, but when I visited her last year she seemed like she was truly having the time of her life. 

After my daily phone call to my mother I drive to work. Today was just like every other day but I had the intense urge to use the restroom. Waddling to the restroom with my bladder nearing its max capacity I burst through the doors only to find a man already using the urinal. So I walked into the stall and did my business. I started browsing on my phone and got distracted for about 15 minutes. Having only 5 minutes to get to my desk and clock in I quickly zipped up my pants and exited the stall. 

When I looked to my left I noticed that the same man was still standing in front of the urinal. Not really having any time to think about how weird that was I ran out the door and ran to my desk. After I was clocked in I started on my work. For a brief moment I thought about the man, but I quickly dismissed it to just a man having difficulty peeing. 

After I finished looking over 85 e-mails and sending them out I decided it was about time for my lunch. I went to the nearby sandwich shop and ate a roast beef sandwich with salt and vinegar chips. After I ate all that I could I folded the paper over the rest of the sandwich and carried it back with me.

When I got to my desk I placed the sandwich on my desk and took my daily after lunch restroom break. Basically just me sitting on the toilet and vaping for about 15 minutes since it is far too cold to stay outside and smoke. When I walked into the restroom I noticed the man was still standing in front of the urinal. Feeling a little uneasy I lightly tapped on his shoulder. He turned around to face me and gave me a smile that made me uneasy. His lips formed into a smile, but his eyes were bouncing all over the place in panic. His throat was making a strained noise, but his mouth just stayed in a closed lip smile. 

I asked him if he needed me to give him any help, but he shook his head no. Shrugging I just walked into the stall and played on my phone while I took a couple of hits from my vape. About ten minutes into my vape break I heard scratching coming from the direction of the man so I got up and opened the stall and peeked out. 

What the fuck.

Blood is now covering his hands as he has started to write out something on the wall in front of him. I shut the stall door and resist the urge to throw up. 

When I finally managed to calm myself down I walked out of the stall and stood behind the man to read what he wrote. It was just a single sentence. Can You Really See Me?

The man turned around with the same smile on his face as he stared me down with pleading eyes. I nodded my head yes at him and ran out the door and ran into the man that worked on the desk next to me. I told him there was a man that has been in front of the urinal for the past 5 hours and now he was writing on the wall with the blood from his fingers. He stared at me with a look of shock and pushed the door open. 

He took a quick look inside and called me an asshole while he walked away. 

I looked in there with him and saw that there was nothing but an empty room and clean blue walls. 

Knowing for a fact that I am going crazy now I open the doors again just to reassure myself, and I see that the man has turned his head completely around as he watches me read his new message.

<TITLE> My friend's ringtone </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-09 23:26:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I work in an office with three other people in my section. We have all grown close through the past five years we have worked together. My name is Brad and we just call my three coworkers Jay, Kay, and El. We always hung out at my place and relaxed together every day after work. When Jay got married the three of us went to his wedding as his bachelors and I was the best man. When Kay proposed to his husband after the new law passed last year we helped him out by singing "Lean on Me in the background. When El was found murdered in the parking lot of an Olive Garden we all went to the funeral with grief taking over our hearts. This hit me the hardest as he was my closest friend out of all of them. We had been through so much, and I truly loved him like my brother and best friend. 


El was always the one that made us laugh when things got tense at work. He was the one that made sure we ate enough food throughout the day. The day he died was the day our office felt different. We had to bring in someone new into our section, and we immediately disliked him as he was rude and self entitled. Whenever I would try to tell him to make a correction he would just ignore me and continue working on his next project. We can call him Esohbee. 


We even tried to be nice by letting him come over to my house with Kay and Jay but all he did when he got there was insult everything about my apartment and drank almost all of my beer. When I asked him if he smoked weed he acted insulted and threatened to get us all fired. 


Fucking dumbass. 


We live in Colorado and as long as we dont smoke at work it is completely fine. So I just lit it and we all smoked it while skipping him out of rotation. When we got to around halfway through Esohbee snatched the blunt out of Jays hands and took about four deep and long hits. He let out a thick cloud of smoke with a satisfied smile on his face. He then told us that he just said he didnt to make sure we wouldnt rat him out for smoking. When Jay tried to take it back Esohbee jumped out of the circle and sat on the couch while smoking the rest of it. 


So after that night we have never invited him back to my house. 


Since then we havent had a problem with him as long as we just ignored anything he did and just handed him the work he was supposed to do. Once he finishes his work I would read it and make sure there arent any errors and then submit it in. If there are any errors I will just correct it and then proceed with my own work. 


So everything was fine until we started hearing Lean on Me playing from around Esohbees desk. That made me a little mad because it was the same ringtone that El used to have. So I turned around and asked Esohbee to put his phone on silent mode, but he looked at me with a confused look. I asked Jay and Kay if it was there phone, but both of them told me that they just had generic ringtones for their phone. 


I know it isnt mine because I always place my phone on silent. So I decided to make sure it isnt Esohbees by dialing his number and tapping call. Immediately the sound of some Electronic Dance song blared in the room and I quickly hung up the phone. Feeling a bit uneasy I walked up to his desk and started to find the source of the music. Jay and Kay started helping me while Esohbee sat at his chair staring at us. We searched for Els phone for the next 10 minutes, but we could not find it and the ringtone stopped going off. 


Over the next five days we kept hearing the ringtone going off between 4pm to 5pm for 15 minutes at a time. Every day it seemed like the ringtone was getting louder and louder. We were getting more and more frightened as each day the words would somehow change in the song. The third day of the ringtone playing it made the lyrics Lean on me when you're not strong to Fuck off me you piece of shit Then on the fourth day it made the lyrics I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on to Mess with me fool, Ill end your sad life. Then yesterday it changed For it won't be long, 'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on to For it wont be long, till you take your last breath and find some inner peace. 



This morning when I woke up I realized that it has been 2 weeks since the death of El. I think of all of the little jokes he would make, and how he liked to just eat the frosting off of cupcakes and throwing the rest away. How he would always put his arm around my shoulder when I felt sad or stressed, and how he would always make a snarky remark about the people we all secretly hated. 


Then I remembered something and with that realization I got in my car and sped to the office. When I got there I saw Esohbee being carted out of the doors by two paramedics. He had a heart attack. 


I walked into the office and up to Els old desk. I bent down and looked behind the desk and saw the letter I gave El 3 years ago. I gave the letter to him because he seemed very depressed so I wrote all of the things that I could think of that were truly remarkable about him. It was really easy as he is easily the most amazing person I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. The night I gave him the letter he had a rope in his hand as he was mentally preparing to kill himself. Thank God he read the letter. I got a phone call that night from my sobbing best friend telling me that I had saved his life. 


Wiping a tear from my eyes I dig my hand deeper behind his desk and pull out a note that simply said To Brad on the front of the letter. This is what it said.


Hey Brad,


First off I want to say that I really love you man.


I not only owe you my life, but I owe you so much more as you have always been there for me.
You are my best friend and I will never forget you even after death. Two days ago I went to the doctor and he told me that I have a Glioblastoma tumor. I was too late going to the doctor and he told me that I basically only have 3 months to live. So for the next month I acted like nothing was happening and I kept making the jokes that I knew everyone loved. I wanted to be there with you guys till the last day.


About five days into the second month I started seeing a shadow in my room that was not mine. I ignored it for 3 days until curiosity got the better of me. So I asked him why he was there. He glided over to my bed and struck a deal with me. If I choose to accept death tomorrow I will have the opportunity to stay in one single location for the next 30 years. I took the deal and told him I would like to be by my desk so that I can make sure you guys are all taken care of. I can influence what happens around, but I will not be able to touch anyone. 


Today has been amazing. We all laughed at old memories as we made new memories. You seemed especially happy about your new promotion. Congrats by the way. I got to do what I always wanted to do. I got to spend the last day I have alive with all of you, and for that I will always be happy. 


I just want you to know that I will be there and make sure you guys will always be happy no matter what I have to do. Im going to go now. Today for my last meal I am going to eat my absolute favorite. A lasagna from Olive Garden. 


See you for the next 30 years bud.


p.s. remember that you can always Lean on Me Im just one call away. 


Love,


[El] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks)

<TEXT> As of right now I am 45 years old, but I have only really lived 19 years. Since I was young my life would jump forward every time something terrible would happen to me. The first time it happened was when I was 6 years old. That is the year that my father was involved in a hit and run. I remember wanting to cry, but before I knew it I felt like all of my grief was gone. I felt at piece, but I felt extremely different. My mother came in my room and told me to get ready for school. 

Somehow I knew where all of my clothes were, but they felt like they were much too big to fit me. When I put my shirt and pants on I realized they fit me perfectly. I went into the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth, but when I walked in I saw my own reflection. I was a lot taller than before, and my face looked a lot more different. When I ate my breakfast my mother dropped me off at a middle school. 

After 30 seconds of confusion I suddenly knew which class to go to, and who my friends were. I knew that I was in 7th grade since I was now 12. I knew that I had a bully, but he was never really that bad. His name was James, and he was always yelled at by his mother when she picked him up from school. My friends name was Brian and he was obsessed with his music. Everything was okay with my life for the next two years. I met my first crush, but she never liked me back. Brian and I grew closer every day since we had the same classes, and James ended up moving away. 

Everything was fine until my 14th birthday when my grandfather had a heart attack in our living room while I was blowing out my candles. After my mother received a call telling her that my grandfather didnt make it I started to cry. Just moments later I open my eyes to find myself sitting at a red light. I looked to my left expecting to see my mother driving, but found a steering wheel in front of me instead. 

That is when I had my first meltdown. I screamed at the mirrors that showed a face of a grown man, and I punched the steering wheel until my hands filled with pain. I looked outside the car window when I managed to calm down and realized that everything was different. I knew I was in the same city I always lived in, but there were stores I never even heard of. The park I used to go to all of the time was torn down and replaced with a mattress store. When I heard the car behind me honking I started to drive to my house. I dont know how I knew how to drive, but somehow I knew what to do and it felt completely natural.  I got to my house to see an old lady sitting outside of the house. When I approached her to ask her if she were lost I was struck with the realization that it was my mother. Fragile and old, but still sitting there with the smile she always had for me. She asked me how I did on the first year of college and I numbly told her that I received all As and made it to the Deans list. I told her I was feeling sick and she told me to go to my room with a worried look on her face.

When I got to my room I sat on my bed and began to remember everything that happened the last 7 years. Brian moved away when I was 13, and my favorite math teacher was found dead and lying on his desk completely still. He was dead for 8 hours before they found him. Not much happened afterwards. I graduated high school and went to my first year of college. The girl that I had a crush on is now my girlfriend. We havent had sex yet, but we both decided to wait until we were married. 

After four years I graduated college and immediately found a wonderful job as an editor. The day I graduated I got on one knee to propose to the love of my life and she said yes. We decided that the next September would be the best time for us to get married to get ourselves financially and emotionally prepared. Three months before our wedding my fianc passed away in a hospital. Knowing what would happen and the depression of her dying hit me at once and I unwillingly started to cry. 

I then found myself sitting in a coffee shop drinking a regular iced coffee. I look around to see where I am and found myself in the city I grew up in, but this time everything was different. People have started to look lifeless and uninterested with whatever they were doing. A baby was sitting at the table next to me just staring at me without any type of emotion. The mother took a look at me and said What the fuck are you looking at? I was blown away not by her statement but by how monotone she said it. 

I turned around and sat silently. I know that I am now 32 and I befriended James when he moved next door to me. The fact that he bullied me when we were so young did not affect how close we ended up getting. Two years after we became friends James was found in his living room with his intestines wrapped around his head and his organs spread around his body. 

Before I start remembering anything else I ran to my mothers house to make sure she was still alive. 

When I was 3 houses away I saw that my mother was rocking back and forth in her favorite chair outside. I go up to her and try to hug her, but she pushed me off and resumed rocking. I looked at her, but she refused to turn my way. When I turned her to face me I fell back onto the ground. Her face was the same but her lips were placed in a frown that immediately told me she hated everything about me. Her eyes were pure black as she said Dont fucking touch me again if you want to keep your hands. It was monotone, but it made me start to shake in fear. 

I went three streets over to my house and I laid in my bed for the next three days trying to figure out what the hell was happening. After three days I ran out of food so I went to the store. Again, everyone is expressionless and just going through the motions of shopping. One person was lying on the floor acting like he was walking. I stared at him for a couple of minutes thinking of a way to help him, but a lady hit him with the cart and started to drag him away. 

I decided right then and there to just live my life as if nothing was different. I got another job as a salesman and nothing happened for the next 5 years. 

After five years I decided to revisit my mother. I drove there and pulled into her driveway. She was still rocking on her chair and I walked up to her. I grabbed her shoulder and lifted her head thinking she just drifted off, but her head fell off her neck and into my hands. I screamed and dropped her head and it rolled to the side of my foot. I look down and see that her face is littered with holes all across her face. Maggots were going in and out of the holes and I turn around and go to my car. 

I start to cry and I know that I am about to lose even more of my life.

I woke up and found myself in a chair. The chair that is in front of the computer I am posting this on now. 

To tell you all that I remember everything now. 

About how I poisoned my math teachers apple I gave him at five pm after he tutored me. I dont know why I did it, but I was tired of seeing people I cared about dying all around me. I remember slicing Jamess stomach open and ripping out his intestines and wrapping them around his face. I took out his organs and spread them all around him. They never found his heart because I buried it beside the tree we would always sit at and drink beers together. I am just tired of seeing people dying all around me, and I dont know why people have stopped showing emotions. I dont know why my mother was dead for so long without anybody alerting the police or even an ambulance. 

All I know is that I am not going to lose any more of my life. 

Please dont get close to me, because I will try my very best to hold onto the last few years I [have] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TITLE> My Father Keeps Laughing At His Broken TV </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-07 07:43:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Around three years ago my father had to move in with me as he was unfit to live alone. Until the past week everything went perfectly. My wife and son adored my father as he is witty and easily likeable, and I have always loved my father with all of my heart. He was there for me whenever I needed someone to cry on, to talk to, and to get advice from. 

When he moved in with us our family wasnt doing too well financially. We barely made ends meet with the measly salary I received from my entry level office job, but when my wife and I heard about my father refusing to leave his bed after the death of my mother we decided to take him in. We had an extra room we used to store my sons toys so we moved all of his toys to his room and bought a cheap bed and mattress.

I found a tv at Goodwill for 20 dollars so I snatched it up before the lady beside me gave it a second thought. I lugged in the 80 pound monstrosity out of my car and into my fathers room. I stuck a paper clip into the coaxial port and managed to get around 12 local channels on his tv. After setting the tv up I went and drove the 45 miles to my fathers house.

When I got to his house I noticed everything about the house had started to fall apart. The front door was missing half its paint, the grass has grown about knee high, and the foundation of the house looked to be depressed. I knocked on the door and waited about 5 minutes before I saw the door opening and saw the face of a defeated man. His back was slightly hunched and his legs were shaking from the pressure of him standing up. The sight broke my heart; the once muscular and invincible father that would lift me up at the age of 13 and place me on his shoulder after I won the basketball game with a buzzer beater now looks like he wouldnt even be able to hold a spoon properly.

Once I got him into the car I grabbed the small bag of clothes he prepared for his stay and we headed back to my house. The whole car ride back we only spoke 7 words combined. Before it became too awkward we arrived back and I led him to his new room. 

He sat on the bed while I flipped through the channels till I reached the local news and left him to get acquainted to his new surroundings.

Things were quiet in the house until I heard the sound of my excited sons voice screaming Grandpa is here! I walked into the room to make sure my son wasnt disturbing him only to see my father smiling from ear to ear as he listened to my son talk about everything that happened at daycare. 

The first dinner was everything I could hope for. My father seemed to be going back to the man I once knew and my son and wife seemed to really enjoy all of the stories my father had to share. 

Over the course of the next three years our whole family has gotten much closer through the help of my father. 

We were all happy and nothing seemed to be off or wrong until my fathers tv went out. He called me to his room and told me that his tv wouldnt turn on. I came in and checked to see if it was still plugged into the outlet. Seeing that everything was plugged in I tried pressing in the power button. After three unsuccessful tries I unplugged the tv and told him I would get him a new one once I got my paycheck in two weeks. 

That night after I came back home from work I heard my father laughing in his room. Thinking it was just my son talking to him I sat in the living room and played around on the computer for an hour. After about an hour I went to my fathers room to get my son and take him to bed. I can still hear him laughing so I knock on the door. He said Come in! in the middle of his laughter and I walked in only to find my father staring at the blank tv screen laughing. 

I ask him what hes laughing about, but all he did was point at the tv while staring intently starting at the screen and laughing every 10 seconds or so.

I felt a little creeped out so I told my father to have a good rest of the night and check in my sons room. When I make sure he is already asleep I go into my room and laid next to my already asleep wife.

The whole night I woke up to the sound of my father laughing. I told myself that I will have to get rid of the tv first thing in the morning and finally managed to fall asleep for the rest of the night. 

When I woke up I went directly into my fathers room and started to lift it up when he started to scream at me. Leave the tv here I need it! I cant keep living without it! I tell him that I would get him a new tv that afternoon, but he kept begging me not to take it. 

The next five days was absolute hell. I barely got any sleep because of his laughter and because I was genuinely concerned my father was losing it. 

Last night I went into his room at 1 am to see what he was still doing up. I walked into his room without knocking and saw that he was an absolute wreck. His eyes have been sunken in and his skin appeared to be sickly gray. I stood next to him about to tell him that he will need to keep it down, but a shape on the screen caught my eye. I looked at the screen to see the reflection of my father, me, and my mother ticking his sides and kissing his cheeks. 

The blood drained from my face as I watched my mother walk up to my reflection and kissed me on the cheek which I know for a fact I felt. I rushed out of the room and ran back into my bed hoping it was all a dream. This morning when I woke up from a fitful sleep I walked into my fathers room only to see that he was absolutely still. I touched his forehead and only felt his cold skin. I put my fingers on his neck to check his pulse, but no matter how long I held down I couldnt feel one. 

With tears dripping from my cheek I looked at the tv screen. 

Only to see my mother lying next to my father and not making a single movement as [well] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TITLE> My Mother Wakes Up As A Different Person Every Day </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-06 07:27:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Cautiously tiptoeing up to my mothers room I look into the crack of the door. I see her waking up and stretching with a smile and I know today is going to be a good day. 

I run into her room and give her a big hug telling her good morning. I know its weird that a person my size would run into his mothers room and throw a hug around her, but it is really rare for her to wake up as my actual mother. 

For longer than I could remember my mother has been waking up as a different person ever day. Some days she wakes up as the angry person who hates her son. On those days she will scream at me all day about how much of a waste I am. How I will never amount to anything. She never hit me, but the things she would say to me felt much worse than the pain I would feel from punches and kicks.

Some days she would wake up as a depressed person that didnt know why my father would ever leave my family. Why she was stuck taking care of me while my father is now always resting. This mother always made me feel depressed about my own life too.

Most of the days she would be a mellow person who would go about day to day things in a robot like way; she would make my breakfast and then clean up the kitchen and living room while I ate. After I was done eating she would go to her bedroom and lay down for her 4 hour nap. While she slept on those days I would just sit around and read a couple of books until she wakes up. Then we go to the living room and I practice my piano while she cooks dinner. We eat dinner together and then we both go to bed.

Then on very rare occasions the mother I once knew wakes up! This is the mother that would wake up every day until I was around 7 when my father left. On these days my mother will wake up with a smile and hug me right when she wakes up. She will call me her little piano master and ruffle my hair. Then she makes me the same delicious breakfast consisting of bacon, eggs, butter and toast, and sausages. After breakfast I will play the piano while my mother dances to the music and when we are both burnt our from dancing and playing I watch tv while my mother goes into her room to rest for an hour. 

Usually after her rest she comes down and we watch a couple of movies, but today she came down with a look of anger on her face. I ask her if she slept well, but she just told me to shut up and go into my room. Confused and sad I trudge up the stairs and hope that tomorrow I get lucky and my mother wakes up happy tomorrow.

I sit on my bed and read a couple of books until I start to drift off and wake up to the feeling of something on my stomach. I wake up to find the face of my mother right in front of me but her face has started to rot. Bits of her face fall on the bottom of my quivering lip and I try to flick them off of me, but every time I raise my hand my mother slaps my hand back and opens her mouth as wide as she can and acts like she is about to bite me. I notice that all of her teeth except for the two in the back are gone so I decide to raise up both of my arms and try to shove her down. 

Right when I push past her slaps I put a hand on each of her shoulders and push her off of me. Once I get her off I ran to her room and locked the door. 

I get on her bed and I try to calm myself down. When I finally managed to get myself to stop shivering I fell back asleep. 

I wake up to the sound of our next door neighbor cutting his grass. 

I prepare myself before I unlock and open the door to my mothers room and I exit glancing left and right. I notice that the door to my room is halfway opened and I see my mothers foot hanging off of the bed. 

I slowly walk into my room and approach my mother. She hasnt woken up yet so I lift her up and take her to her bed.  

I sit around in my room thinking about the night before. How her flesh was hanging off of her face and hitting my chin. 

It only takes me a few minutes to reason with myself that what happened is not possible. 

I go back into her room and flick off a piece of her cheek that was hanging down.

I loved my mother so much, but a year ago she told me that she wished she were dead instead of having to take care of her deadbeat 30 year old son. 

So I gave her what she wanted. 

I hope she can wake up happy [today] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TITLE> Magpie That Saved My Life </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-06 05:00:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Three years ago I woke up on a concrete floor next to my two best friends. We were sitting side to side handcuffed to the ground. 

I remember I panicked and tried jerking the handcuffs off of my hands by jerking it every which way until the skin started peeling away from my wrist.

Defeated, I sat on the ground and waited for the others to get up. 

I looked behind me and saw that there was a small opened window. Excitement is replaced with despair when I looked out to see only woods surrounding the building I was in.

I saw my friend next to me stirring so I grabbed his shoulder and whisper Brian get up, what the fuck happened last night? He looked at me with a dazed look and tried to fall back asleep. So I shook him even harder until he was completely awake. 

He looked like what me when I woke up; trying to rip the handcuffs off of him only to give up after a couple of seconds. Then he turned around to show a look of confusion as he glanced out the window wondering where we were. 

Brian grabbed Tim by the shirt and shook him for a couple of minutes until Tim opened his eyes. Before he started tugging on the handcuffs I told him that we were stuck in here and that there is an opened window. We just need to find a way to get rid of these handcuffs since tugging on them will not work. 

We quickly noticed that the room was almost empty except for a couple of boxes on the other side of the room. 

Collectively deciding that the best thing to do was to wait and try to recollect what happened the night before. 

We were out celebrating Brians new promotion so we went from bar to bar getting more drunk by the hour. All three of us could not remember what happened after we got to the fourth bar. 

Defeated and feeling completely lost I leaned on the wall and racked my brain for answers. 

That is when I felt a small peck on the back of my head.  I turned around to see a Magpie sitting on the window. The magpie stared at me for just a second before it shook its head as if to tell me the answer was no.

Then the Magpie flew away as I heard the sound of a door opening and closing. 

A regular looking woman with short red hair bounced down the stairs with a look of complete joy on her face. She had freckles all around her face and a chip on her right buck tooth. She was wearing a simple blue dress and purple shoes. 

She walked up to Tim and asked him Do you think Im pretty?

Tim spat on her shoes and told her Fuck No.

She walked past Brian and came to me with a smile on her face. Do you think Im pretty?

I remembered the magpie shaking its head no at me so I said No.

With a smirk she walked up to Brian last. 

She asked him the same question, and Brian without hesitation said Of course, youre absolutely beautiful. The girl shrieked with joy and gave Brian a deep kiss. When she pulled away Brian had the look of victory. She took out a key from her pocket and started to unlock Brians handcuffs. 

When she got them off she gave Brian a hug and when Brian hugged her back his whole body jerked forward dramatically. He started whimpering while she pet him on top of his head. When she turned him around he let out a groan of pain. 

I saw his exposed spine disconnecting with the flesh around it as she slowly cut up until she had a decent grip on his ribs and ripped the right ribs out and did the same to the left side of his back. She grabbed the ribs she tore out and happily bounced upstairs leaving Brain to die surrounded by his intestines and organs. 

Tim abandoned all reason and starting tugging on his handcuff with everything he had until I started to see the flesh ripping off the side of his right hand. When he started to grind the handcuff against his fragile bone he stopped while wincing in pain and started to sob. 

That was the first time the Magpie saved my life. 

For three days we waited around for her to come, but the only sign that she was still there was from the sound of happy humming from upstairs and the food that we woke up to every single morning. On the third day the Magpie came back and pecked on my head to alert me it was there. I handed it some bread as it nodded its head up and down. I tried petting it, but flew away before I got a finger on the bird. 

Tims right hand had started to become black with infection around his exposed bone. All he did when he woke up after seeing Brian die was repeatedly say What the fuck are we going to do? Then he would go back to sobbing for hours until he fell back asleep.

Around twenty minutes after the Magpie flew away the woman came downstairs and greeted us with a cheerful Hello! 

She walked up to me and gave me a peck on the cheek. While rubbing my forehead with her right palm she asked Would you reject me if I asked you to buy me a drink? Just as the Magpie showed me I looked at the woman and told her yes. 

After she gave me a light slap on my forehead she walked up to Tim. Asked him the same question, but she gave him a kiss on his chin instead. He told her that he would have definitely bought her a drink had she just asked him. 

She walked back to where I was sitting and gave me a kiss on my lips. 

That is when Tim started to laugh and kicked me on the side of my leg calling me a dumbass. 

As sweat started to cover my hands I started to beg her to let me answer differently. Feeling stupid for ever trusting a bird to make my decisions I went into a flurry of desperation; she ignored what I was saying and gave me another light peck on my lips. She then walked up to the boxes on the other side of the room and took out a small steak knife. 

I start to squirm away from her until I realize that she is standing over Tim. With a smile on her face she sat down on his ankles. With the steak knife she started to slowly cut right above his left knee. Tim was screaming at the top of his lungs while he tried to slap her hands away from his knee, but the cuffs made it to where he was only inches away. It took over 40 minutes for her to finish cutting both of his legs. It only took 16 minutes for Tim to stop screaming. 

That night I started to pray to anything out there. I just wanted to leave, and I felt like there was no way to escape. 

That is when the Magpie saved my life the third time. The feeling of something pecking my head woke me up in the middle of the night and I turned around quickly to see a key in the Magpies mouth. 

I grabbed the key out of the birds mouth and unlocked my cuffs. 

With each step I went up I could hear the creaking get louder and louder. I held my breath until I reached the top of the stairs and turned the knob on the door. 

It opened luckily so I turned to the left and walked towards the front door. Before I reached the door I saw a figure to my right and my body seized up in fear. I turned to my right and saw Tims lower legs and Brians ribs sewn onto other body parts. The only thing missing to make the body complete was the head. Above the body there was a piece of paper on the wall with just one sentence written down. From Liars I Will Make the Perfect Man.

<TITLE> I Quit My Job To Participate In a Sleeping Experiment </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-06 00:52:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Three months ago I made the spontaneous decision to get myself involved in an experiment. I am required to lie on a bed for six straight months while sleeping at least twelve hours a day.

While I was walking down my street to catch a cab to work a man approached me with a big smile on his face. He told me if I wanted to make 150k in six months. Intrigued, I asked him what I had to do. With a smile he told me to go with him to his office about 3 minutes away walking distance.

I promise Im not one to just follow anyone to a location I know nothing about, but South Korea is equipped with cameras all over the streets and roads. Just to be safe I texted my buddy who worked right beside me to call the cops if I dont call him within the next 2 hours, and I texted him the address of the office once we got there.

Feeling assured that I had all of my bases covered I followed the man into the building. When we got inside I was amazed by how white everything was. The desks, floors, ceiling, wall, chairs, and even the outfits that the workers inside wore were all solid white. I couldnt help but stare at everything while we walked towards the back of the building. When we get to the back hallway of the building I notice everything is white here except for the doors.
There are 3 doors in the back and each door is a different color. 

The first door is blue, the second is yellow, and the last is red.

He stops in front of the blue door and opens it.

Holy shit, everything in the room is solid blue. I also notice that there is a huge bed with blankets, pillows, and frame which are all completely blue. It really looks like a normal bedroom with a tv in front of the bed and a laptop in the middle of the bed.

He pulled out two chairs and patted on one as he sat in the other. I sat down beside him and he pulled out a piece of paper.

Rules was written on the top with a list and a line for me to sign at the bottom.

The list stated the following:

1) You will not be able to leave your bed during the six months you are here.

2) You are to sleep for at least 12 hours a day.

3) You have access to the laptop and your phone, but you must never reveal what you are doing.

4) Every two months we will move your bed to another room. We will move you, but it is very important that you stay in the same position you were in while you were lying down.

5) When you receive your food you may put your head up to eat, but at least half of your back must be on the bed.

6) If you need to use the restroom press the button on the side of the bed. We have a way for you to use the restroom without you having to leave the bed.

7) If you feel sick press the button twice and we will send someone to assist you.

8) Once the six months is up you will be given the 150k on a card. If you lose the card we will not be able to replace it for you.

X________________________

I feel a little weird about having to stay in the bed for 6 months, 
but I do love to sleep and being paid to sleep for 12 hours seems like a complete luxury. Plus, I will still be able to use a laptop and my phone while Im lying down so I wont be bored at all. I can just log into my Netflix and watch every single show I have been meaning to watch.

I call up my buddy and tell him that I am quitting my job and that 

I found a better opportunity. He asked me what it was, but I had already hung up on him by then.

I let my manager know that I am quitting as well and hang up on him while he was cussing me out and screaming at me about how 

I completely screwed his team up.

I know I just ruined my chances of ever going back to my job and also getting another job in Korea, but once this 6 months is up Im going back to the states and finally starting my own restaurant.

Once I signed the contract the man handed me a pair of white pajamas. I changed into the pajamas and got on the bed.

The first 3 weeks go by and I start to run out of things to watch on the laptop. I dont have anyone I really talk to, and my buddy has stopped talking to me when I wouldnt tell him where I am working now. I have never been close to my family and whenever I try calling my mother and father they dont pick up the phone. The strange thing is; no matter how bored I am I still feel somewhat happy. I think about how much the money will change my life. I daydream about running a successful restaurant and making a successful chain after a couple of years.

I turn on the tv and start flipping through the channels. I get distracted watching this show about people flipping shit over having their cars towed for the next two hours and before I know it a person in white comes in and injects me with something that makes me fall asleep.

I havent dreamt in the past three weeks, but today I finally had a dream. I am standing next to my mother and father in a Flea Market. The same place I used to go with my parents once a week until I was thirteen. We are looking at a couple of turtles to get for my aquarium when the man behind the counter approaches us. He points at one particular turtle and tells me this is the turtle I should take home.

He turns it around to reveal the face of the turtle and I start to shake. It looks like a turtle everywhere else but the face; the face it had belonged to my old best friend who killed himself when he was 24. He overdosed on heroine in the dorm room we were staying at together the day before graduation. The turtle turned its face at me and slowly closed his eyes while his tongue slid out all the way to the middle of his shell.

I woke up in a cold sweat, but immediately felt a wave of peace as I knew it was all a dream.

For the rest of the first two months in the blue room I had the same exact dream, but for some reason as soon as I woke up I would automatically feel at peace.

When the timer went off signifying that it was the end of two months they took me to the Yellow Room. Two men came in and changed my diaper (embarrassing but true) and took me to the room while I stayed in the same position. The man that brought me here was sitting on the desk waiting for me. He smiles at me and tells me that I am doing perfectly. As long as I keep still on the bed it will all be over before I know it.

Everything was the same in this room as the previous room, but everything in here was solid yellow.

The first two weeks in the new room I did not have that horrible dream, but I felt a little sad that I had another 4 months to go. I just really wish I had followed what my father wanted me to do and go into law. He already had a firm set up, and he was willing to offer me a six figure salary on a silver platter. He offered to pay for my schooling, but my hard headed self decided to major in English.

I remember how betrayed I felt when my best friend died. He was my only friend and now hes gone. I have never found a woman that liked me making me still wait for my first date at the age of 24. I have successfully wasted the first third of my life on nonsense.

The night of the sixteenth day in this room I finally had a dream.
I am outside of my dorm room in college. I find the key to the room in my hand so I put it in the keyhole and open the door. My friend is sitting on the bed sobbing into his hands.

I walk up to him and start patting him on the shoulder and telling him everything will be okay.

He starts screaming No It Wont! Nothing Will Ever Get Better! Then he slowly lifts his face up at me, and I stand there in shock. His eyes are full of sadness, but he has an inhuman smile on his face. His lips are stretched out and ripped opened to reach the middle of his cheeks and the bottom of the lip is torn to his chin. He slowly licks the bottom of his teeth before he grabs me and screams at the top of his lungs at me as his blood hits me on the face.

This dream comes to me for the rest of the time I am in the yellow room, and each time I get more and more depressed about what he says. Nothing will ever get better, and I know thats the truth. I can make my own restaurant, but it will probably fail. I will be broke again, and now I wont have an opportunity to work in Korea now because I ruined the one reference I had.

After the two months is up the timer goes off once more and the same two workers lift me up and take me to the final room.
Once again I see the man sitting at the desk.

Last room my man, after this you are done. He says that and leaves the room.

I look around the room and see that it is identical to the other two rooms but red this time.

I did not dream for almost the whole two months I have been in here, but anger has completely taken over all of my emotions. Why the fuck would a father kick his son out of the house for not choosing the career he wanted? I was never a bad kid and I never got in trouble. Whenever I struggled in the past couple years and asked for some help all I got was the phone hung up on me.
Everyone that I have loved has left me or fucked me over. My first crush in high school laughed in my face when I asked her to prom.
I fucking hate everyone I know, and I just hope they can never feel happiness again.

Last night I had a dream. It was the last night I spend in here.

I am standing in front of my friend.

I know what just happened already by the smirk on his face. He has gone behind my back once again and has decided to go to law school and was just guaranteed the job my dad wanted to give me to him. He has just finished gloating in my face about how much more successful he would be than me, and how he just remained my friend through high school and college so that he could pursue his greatest passion. He told me how my father told him he was the son he wished he had.

I already knew about it all before I came into the room. My father called me while I was in the car driving to my dorm telling me how he has no more use for me, and for me to go ahead and get all of my stuff out of his house before the end of the week.

Once he is done bragging he lays on his bed and goes to sleep.
I creep to his bed with a needle completely filled with heroine and find a vein. I slide the needle in fast and inject all of the heroine in to the vein on his neck.

I woke back up with a smile on my face.

I think the red room was my favorite. </TEXT>

<TITLE> We Have Been Stuck In Our Office For 3 Days </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-05 02:11:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After three days of being stuck in our office twenty-three of my coworkers and I are sitting quietly in our office chairs thinking of a plan to get out of this nightmare.

Let me give you some background information of our company since I have more than enough time to tell you everything that is going on. 


We are split into two businesses in our building. One side is a group of eighteen people that organizes conferences. We have four managers, three assistant managers, and eleven regular employees. The managers obtain the contracts for the conferences and lead a group of one assistant manager and four to five regular employees. Once we finish the conference we will go to the conference and make sure everything goes according to plan.

The other side is a group of sixteen people that develop chips and make the chips and distribute. Eight people develop the chips, five people will make the chips, and three people will contact companies looking for chips and create the order and send them out once the chips are made.

I know all of this may seem like useless information, and it really is useless information. I just really wanted to explain out everything before I tell you what happened three days ago. 

When the alarm went off signifying that it is 6 pm a manager and three regular employees from the conference organizing side packed their stuff up and headed downstairs. 

About ten seconds after they left we heard a low guttural sound proceeded by the sounds of screams from the four employees. Over the course of the next thirty seconds we heard the sound of bones crunching and flesh ripping until we heard four thuds on the second floor. 

Besides one person that was screaming from chip distribution all of us just stared at each other shaking with fear. I got out of my seat and walked to where I heard the four thuds right outside of our main office door. I looked to the left and then to the right and found the four heads of the four employees that went downstairs. The thing that scared me the most was the fact that the faces were ripped from each of their faces and put on the head of another employee.

After I got over the shock I closed the doors to the main office and locked the doors. 

I told everyone what I saw only to be met with a mixture of people screaming, people crying, and people just sitting in their chairs completely in shock. 

Someone called 911 and told them what was happening. The cops sent out three officers to our company. I know it was three because after twenty minutes we heard three wet thuds on the other side of our office door.

We called 911 again only to be hung up on this time. 

We just sat around the office and ate the little snacks we had stored in our desk until the next morning. One of the managers from the conference side decided to try his luck and he opened the door to our office. He stared at the heads of the officers in front of the door and the heads of the employees to the right of the door. With a shudder he walked to the stairs and headed down leaving the door opened. 

I walked up to the door and took a look down the stairs while the manager was slowly going down one step at a time. Right when he hit the second to the last step I saw his body jerk from side to side as his skin separated away from his body leaving him wailing in pain. He grabbed his skin and tried to put it back around his exposed flesh until each of his limbs were ripped from his body. His organs and intestines flung out of his body and literally disappeared along with his limbs. When his head was removed from the rest of his body everything except the skin of his face and the head disappeared. 

The skin slowly floated over his severed head and wrapped tightly around the skull before the head flew towards my head. Before it hit me I slammed the doors shut and locked the doors.

I told everyone that there was nothing we could do. I told them what is killing us is invisible and how it easily tore up the manager and made everything but his head disappear into thin air. 

For that day and the next day we drank water from the water fountain, ate the rest of the snacks that we had, and talked to each other about what we would do if we managed to get out of here. 

On the morning of the third day I woke up to see three of the chip developers and two of the chip makers getting ready to head out of the door. 

I jumped up and begged them not to leave. 

The guy who was leading the group, which was one of the developers, told me that they would all rather die than be stuck here for the rest of their lives.

Once they left I got on the computer on my desk and decided to send out a cry for help here. Please let me know if there is anything we can do to get out of this mess. Has anyone ever heard of something like this before?

The screaming of the five men have just stopped and I now hear the sound of heads hitting our office [doors] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TITLE> I Don't Care My Parents Never Really Cared About Me </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-02 15:27:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On the second day of every month my friends and I go out to drink at the same bar at the same time. My group consists of 3 of my lifelong friends and myself. We have been friends since we were 8 years old and since we were 16 we have always made sure to gather together on the second of every month to share a 30 pack of beer. 

Whether the second day of the month be on a Tuesday or a Saturday we have always convinced our parents then and our wives or girlfriends now of how important this tradition was. Of course, when we were young we would just tell them that we were going to spend the night over at a friends house to enjoy a new game they just got. Parents were dumb that way; as long as they werent the parents to watch the group of hormone driven teens they were okay with wherever we were going as long as they knew where we were.

My first friends name was Evan. He was the type of person that felt he was right no matter what the topic was. Basically if he told us that the moon was made out of cocaine and litter we were forced to say he was right so that he would just stop fucking arguing with all of us. The next friend was Brian; who was the punching bag of the group. Let me tell you, Brian was not the smartest person in the world. He scored a 15 on his ACT and fucking celebrated because he felt like it wasnt a failing grade. Brian, however, did have a very big role with our group; no matter what kind of trouble we got into Brian would always say it was his fault. It didnt take long for all of our parents to stop trusting dumb ol Brian. Lastly, Jeremy, he was the person who never even took a second to think of the consequences of his or our actions. Thinking back, Jeremy should have been the one to take the blame for every single thing we got in trouble for. 

I was the last to fill the circle of friends. I provided almost nothing to the group, but my parents were the least caring by far. They just cared about how well their company was doing and how much money they were making that month. This was why my house became one of the hotspots for our group. We would drink a couple of beers in Brians house and then head over to my house after 10 pm. That was the time where my parents would fall asleep. They knew we were there, but they hardly cared about my well being so they never really said anything when they woke up to find empty cans of beer and empty bottles of liquor. 

They would just wake the lady that cleaned our house out of her slumber to take care of the mess. I guess that is why I never really learned to deal with any type of consequences. If I burned the food that I was preparing for my parents the cook of the house would whip up a delicious dish and tell my parents I cooked it on my own. When I made a mess the cleaner of the house would clean the mess up and tell my parents what a dependable and clean young man I was,

Okay, Im done talking about my childhood and the backgrounds of the friends that I have made a lifelong pact of friendship with. 

We were drinking together one day when I told my friends that we should go to my old house for old times sake. The house is now my own after both of my parents passed away, but I havent even set a foot in the house since I moved out of the house for college.

When we finished our beers and walked the half mile to my house. 

We find ourselves standing in front of maybe the shittiest looking half a million dollar house you have ever seen. The house has been vandalized with various words throughout the exterior of it. The front door looks like someone has chewed on the whole door with the teeth of a deranged meth addict. 
 
I dug into the ground of the third decoy rock in front of the door and pulled out the key. 

I opened the door and we went in.  

When we first went into the house we didnt see anything out of the ordinary so we sat on the floor of the living room and proceeded to drink the beer we bought on the way. After we drank 2 beers each we decided to reminisce about old times. We started off by talking about our old high school sweethearts and where they were. (We stalk our exes on social media) Then we talked about the group of kids that used to torment us throughout our middle school years, and how it was odd how every single one of the kids from the group of tormentors never showed up to our high school. Afterwards we talked about our parents. Every single one of my friends had something great and something bad about their parents. 

How they were there for them when they went through something rough, and how they revolved around their lives a little too much. I feel a tinge of sadness as I realize that I hardly knew my parents at all. They were there to talk to me for a couple of minutes, but once they got bored of me they would just walk away from me and act like I never existed.

I told my friends that I didnt really have any memories, but I would get back to it if I think of something.

After a couple more hours of drinking and talking about the goofy shit that happened to our lives we decided that this was the perfect time to end the night. With a hug farewell we went our separate ways. 

Evan went to the hotel he was staying at for the next three nights. Brian said he was going to meet up with a girl he met at a bar (He was too drunk to realize that she was a 55 year old prostitute), and Jeremy went to a nearby motel that had a couple of cop cars outside of and thought he would find some crazy shit before going to bed. 

I went down to the basement and walked past the familiar sight of 10 dolls of mine hanging by a noose from the ceiling. I walk past them and to the vent that was at the back of the basement. I open the vent to see the skeletons of my parents right where I left them. 

They were never there for me.

They never cared about what I did, and I never cared what happened to them.

I know my friends killed them so we could always have the ideal location to hang out.

I know this because I was there and because I helped [them] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TITLE> I Have the Worst Hangover </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-02 05:52:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Waking up with a hangover is the worst possible thing. 

I found my wallet in my pocket, but my phone is still missing. I need my phone. For my job if you do not have a phone you might as well call it quits.

I think back to the various bars I went to the night before, but after the first bar my mind draws a blank.

Sighing, I decide to head out to the bar and see if I can retrace my steps. I go into the kitchen to grab my car keys, but quickly realize my car keys are nowhere to be found too. 

Hitting myself in the head for being such a drunk I run out my door and run the three miles to the bar. 

Despite my active drinking lifestyle I have managed to stay in shape by exercising 3 days a week. Plus, my job requires me to stay in shape as it requires a large amount of stamina at times. 

When I arrive at the bar I see 5 cop cars around the building. I see a body lying on the ground with the head smashed in. The bartender is still outside talking to the cops, and I approach him and ask him if he saw my phone in there. 

Met with weird and judgmental glances I realize I should have probably just waited before asking, but like I said, I really need my phone. 

Getting hit with the memory of going down about a quarter of a mile to the other bar I decide to head over there. 

When I got to the next bar I see 3 cop cars outside of that building. Curious I walk towards the voices and find 4 cops examining the body of a male that was stabbed in the chest and ditched on the side of the dumpster. The other 2 cops are talking to the owner of the bar. 

I know the last place I went to, but I had to mentally prepare myself before heading over there. It was an abandoned house that was in between the bar and my house. I went there with a good friend of mine to just drink as many beers as we can. We didnt want to go back to our house yet so our inebriated minds decided this was the best possible place to enjoy really cheap beer. 

When I got to the house I snuck my way in. I go to the bedroom to see the body of my buddy with his intestines exposed and spilling on the aged wooden floors. 

I find my phone lying next to his head and I pick it up and leave the house.

I need to stop working while Im drunk.

Im getting a little too messy.

<TITLE> Our New Parrot Is Teaching My Son Some Weird Phrases </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-01 11:11:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When my son was 6 my wife and I decided to go the pet store to get him his favorite animal. After an hour and a half we left with some bird feed, a cage, and a bright yellow and green parrot. He was a year old and to our delight the workers there have already taught the parrot how to talk. 

Once we got home we were greeted by my son and brother. My brother looked a bit flustered from having to watch our very energetic son for the past 3 hours, but hes living with us while he finds a job so I dont feel bad whenever we make him watch our son from time to time.

My son screeches with joy whenever he sees his new friend, and immediately tries to talk with the parrot. I didnt think he would respond, but when my son said hi! he replied back with hi! Once I make sure my son isnt doing anything to get bitten by the parrot I decide to go to my room and do some work on my laptop.

While I am checking my work e-mails I hear my son laughing downstairs. After a couple of minutes my son runs upstairs and shouts Basement! and runs back downstairs laughing the whole way down. 

After around 30 more minutes my son runs into my room again and shouts Let me out! I tell my son to keep the parrot in his cage so he doesnt run away. He nods his head and runs back downstairs.

While I am shutting off my laptop 20 minutes later my son runs right back into my room. Go fuck yourself! surprised at what he said I hold him by his arms and tell him to never say that again. I explain to him that it is a very bad word, and with a sad look on his face he nods his head. 

I go downstairs with my son to look at the parrot and he is saying repeatedly Dont touch me." Not really knowing what else to do I place a sheet over the cage. I like how my son has taken such a liking to the parrot already, but I dont know if we can keep him around especially with my son copying whatever he says.  

I go to my wifes office and tell her what the parrot has been teaching him, and with a concerned look on her face tells me that she would go take the parrot back to the pet shop and get another one that looked similar. 

The next morning I tell my son that his parrot is sick and that mommy would take him to the doctor while he took a nap. After being reassured that the parrot wont die he happily finishes his breakfast and plays with the parrot. 

I go into the bedroom to wake my wife up, but she is fast asleep and would not wake up no matter how much I shook her. Leaving my snoring wife in bed I walk back into the living room where my brother is asleep on the couch. I ask him to watch my kid while I go to the pet shop, but he insisted on taking the parrot and letting me stay home. 

At 12 pm I put my son down for his nap and my brother gets ready to head out. Once he is done getting ready I hand him my car keys. My brother looks at me for a second and said Man, I never told you how much I appreciate you letting me stay here. I love you man. I really hope I can repay you back somehow. I give him a hug and he heads out. 

After waiting for a little over 3 hours and having to explain to my concerned son that his uncle and parrot would be back soon I decide to give him a call. When he doesnt pick up after the 5th call I take my son into my wifes office and tell her Im taking her car to the pet store to see if hes there.

I go to the pet store and notice my car is not there. I go into the store and show the worker a photo of my brother and ask them if he came in. She tells me that Im the first one to come into the store today, and she would let me know if he comes in. I thank her and hand her my business card. 

I go back to the house and tell my son everything is fine and they will be back soon. 

I go into my wifes office and tell her that my brother is nowhere to be found. We decide to call the cops and tell them about the whole situation. They told me they would look into it, but chances are unlikely to find him as he could have just decided to leave on his own. I give them my license plate number and tell them I have a bright red Chevrolet Malibu. 

Five days later I open the door to be greeted by two cops and my sons parrot. 

According to a witness that lived across the street from the incident, he saw a woman flagging down a red Malibu. My brother rolled down his window and talked to her for a second and pulled into her driveway. He got out of the car with the parrot and went into her house. He noticed the car never left the driveway after a couple of days and saw on the news about someone going missing in a red Malibu. After he made the connection he contacted the police department, and shortly after the cops arrived at the house where my car was.

They found 9 mutilated bodies in the basement of the house. The parrot was right next to the bed where my brothers mutilated body was placed. 

The house was owned by the woman who owned the pet store. All of the employees when later questioned by the cops said they found it odd that the same parrot was returned to the store 9 times, but they never really questioned it. 

After I am done talking to the cops I take the parrot from them and I place him in the living room. 

The parrot looks up at me and tells me love you man.

I wish I could go back in time to tell him I loved him [too] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TITLE> Why I Will Never Trust A Tickle Me Elmo Again </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-31 02:32:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the small town I live in we have around 4,000 people. Our town being so small and containing so little people our options for stores are very limited. If we want to go to a major store we would have to drive 30 minutes out to the closest mall or 45 minutes out for the closest Wal-Mart. When it came time to buy gifts whether it be for Christmas or a birthday most of our residents would go to the local small market which sold a couple of electronics and a small selection of jewelry. 

Gifts for children were an easy fix as we had a decent toy store owned by one of our older residents. He was an 86 year old man and we all called him Papa Bear. He was loved by all of the children and he always made sure he stocked the newest and best toys in his store. Another thing, he always made sure to keep prices lower than all of the major toy stores and even Wal-Mart. Our town was very lucky to have Papa Bear and even at the age of 17 I visited him at least once a week.

On the day of my 18th birthday I received my first laptop from my mother. My father gave me the keys to his old Chevrolet Camaro. My aunt and uncle gave me a check for $300 (which when I tried to cash was declined by my bank), and my poor old grandmother bought me a Tickle Me Elmo from Papa Bears Toy Shop. I did not have the heart to return the gift or to tell my grandmother I was far too old to play with the toy she got me so with a grin I hugged my grandmother and thanked her. 

I placed the Elmo on my side table beside my bed and got comfortable on my bed to watch some dumb videos online after my birthday celebrations. After around 2 hours of watching videos I dozed off. 

I was brought out of my slumber to the sound of Elmo giggling. After giggling it said Hug me and dont let go! Thinking what the hell I grab the Elmo and give it a hug. When I stopped hugging it; the doll said Now hug me tighter till your arms get tired! Getting a little annoyed as it was the middle of the night I turned the doll off and placed it on the side of my bed once again. 

I quickly forgot about the toy for the next couple of days as I was busy packing all of my stuff to get ready for college. 

Around 4 days later I was having trouble falling asleep. My mind was racing from the anticipation of moving to one state over to attend college. This is the first time I am ever leaving the town I live in, and I am filled with both fear and excitement. 

After about 30 minutes of lying down I hear the Elmo doll talking to me again. I bring him to the bed where I hear him telling me Hug me, Hug me, I love being hugged! Getting a little annoyed that he is turned on I decide to take the batteries out. 

When I open the back flap I notice that there is a small vial placed underneath the battery pack. I carefully take it out and place it in the drawer in my side table. 

The next morning at 6 am I head over to the police station with the Elmo and the vial. When I go inside I show them the vial and the doll. They take the vial from me and tell me they would look into what it was.

Eighteen hours later Im unpacking all of my stuff in my dorm room. 

I get a phone call and I answer it. 

My mother and father are in custody for the attempted murder of me. 

The vial contained Ricin, and my parents confessed to placing the vial in the doll and telling my grandmother to gift the doll to me. 

They did not want me to leave their side, and they felt the only way to stop me from going was to kill me and have me by their side permanently.

To this day I will never trust my parents again, and I will never buy a Tickle Me Elmo no matter how much my son wants [one] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TITLE> My Son Has Been Talking To The Walls </TITLE>

<TEXT> My father went missing when I was 19 years old. It was after a week-long argument with my mother resulting in my father being there the night before and gone by the morning. I was home during the summer break of my freshman year when it happened, and I have never felt so betrayed my whole life. He was supposed to be there to see me graduate college, to be there when I was feeling down and I needed to talk to someone, but all of those hopes were sliced away when I found out he took the easy way out.

It really wasnt any different not having him around though; throughout my childhood he would go back and forth from Korea to America. He would be with us for a couple of months before finding another great opportunity and having to fly back to Korea. So when he decided to run away from our home I decided the best thing to do is to forget about that man in general. 

When I went back to college I focused on my studies, and after three years I graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice. I met a lovely lady my sophomore year and once we both graduated we decided to get married. After we got married we settled into a cozy 2 bedroom apartment and lived our lives happily for the next 2 years. 

I worked at a retail job because the job market was shit at the time so I had to take whatever was available, but come to find out I had  a real gift in sales. After a year I reached management, and after another 6 months of bringing my store numbers up by 30% each month they decided that I deserved to be promoted to regional manager. When I got home and told my wife the wonderful news she was very excited to tell me her wonderful news. We are having a baby!

Filled with excitement we started to get everything ready in the 2nd bedroom during the next 40 weeks. On the day that she was supposed to have the baby I took a month off and waited patiently by her side. 3 days later I was being shaken by my wife and I knew immediately what it meant. 11 hours later I was looking into the eyes of my beautiful son for the first time. We named him Gabriel and he was everything I ever hoped for.

He was certainly a smart child too! He stopped using pacifiers on his own at 3 months, and he started to walk by 10 months. At a year and a half he started to use words in the right context, and by 2 he was speaking to us in short sentences. He knew both Korean and English and was beginning to take a liking to singing.

When my son was three I heard the unfortunate news that my mother had passed away. I took my wife and child 3 miles down the road where the funeral was being held. As I gazed into the hole where they placed the body of my only parent I fell to ground and started to sob. My son stood by my side and rubbed my shoulder and told me Its okay daddy, you still have me and mommy. With that statement I regained my composure and looked at the family I had now. Feeling happy once again I stood there for the rest of the funeral with my child and my wife in my arms.

The next day I was told that my mothers house was fully paid for and I was the one to receive the house at the time of her death. Her life insurance also left us 100k and with that we paid for everything we needed to set up the house to our liking and put a sizable chunk into Gabriels college fund.

The first three nights in the house went by smoothly and I felt completely at home. My wife loves the size of the house and how it has 3 bedrooms with 2 full bathrooms. My son likes the fact that he now has a second room to place all of his toys in. 

The only strange thing about the whole house is that my son has now started talking to the wall that is by his bed. It started off by him just staring at the wall and giggling, and then he proceeded to start saying little things like how old are you? What is your favorite color? I like cupcakes what is yours? Thinking he just had an imaginary friend I let him talk to whatever he wanted to.

On the fifth day I was jolted awake at 5 a.m. to the sound of my son screaming. I run out of my room and into his when I see him pointing at the wall and saying Dont show me the bloody face show me the nice face. I dont like the bloody face.

Panicking I pick him up and put him in between me and my wife and he falls back asleep shortly after. The next morning while we are eating our breakfast I ask him who he has been talking to. He responds back with James I ask him if James is a friend of his and he tells me he is; then I ask him what he was talking about when he told James not to show his bloody face. His answer makes me gag on my piece of toast. James will sometimes come to the room with his face covered in blood, and he told me to tell you that he never left you.

I call a crew to come to my house to tear down the wall that my mother put up when I went back to college for my sophomore year. We used to have a 2 bedroom house, but my mother told me that she wanted to make a third bedroom in case I decide to move back in with my family. I normally wouldnt be so drastic and tear down a whole wall, but my fathers name was James.

When the wall came down I noticed a bag in the corner. I opened the bag to see a pile of bones and skull right on top.

My father never left me.

My mother was just tired of arguing every [day] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

Edit: can't spell bag -.-

<TEXT> After seven years of working at the same department store and selling the same shoes year after year I have slumped in what you would call a salesman depression. Well, that is what my manager called it when he sent me to the back warehouse to give me a talk after he saw me cussing out a customer for asking if he could use other shoelaces instead of the original ones. I mean, who doesnt know that changing out the shoelaces is probably the easiest thing to change on shoes? 

So I am just walking around the dusty and overstocked warehouse waiting on my manager when I stumbled on a series of sentences written on the back side of the wall. The first sentence was Help me Im being chased. About twenty paces later I think theyre just toying with me was written, and on the corner Im sorry for making you mad, I promise I wont come back again was scribbled in an almost unreadable way. 

Thinking it was just a prank I continue to wait. 

Honestly, when I first started working here I was probably the best worker in the store. For five years, five fucking years I gave this store everything my body could handle to place value on myself. I was never late, I received the most positive reviews from customers, and I always came into work if they ever needed someone on my off day. Month after month, my portrait stood proud in the employee break room publicly stating that, once again, I was the employee of the month.

Its just after the five year mark; every question the customer asked me started to seem really dumb to me. I did not see a point in showing up to work every day on time when almost no one else did, and when they called me on my off day I would reject the call as soon as it came in. 

I honestly wanted to get fired so I could find something else, but I have never been one to quit so since they never fired me I tortured myself day after day helping these helpless customers. 

I got a little more reckless with my customers day after day. It all started off with very sly smart comments, to giving the customers the wrong product on purpose and seeing if they would just buy the product to avoid any awkward situation, to snapping back at the customers that were rude to me. Then finally today was the day I decided to start cussing out a customer for the stupid question. It wasnt a complete vulgar stream of words or anything. Just Why the fuck did you ask me that when youre standing right beside the replacement shoelaces dumbass? I mean a completely valid point, but of course since it was contaminated with forbidden words Im stuck in the warehouse waiting to get bitched at by my manager. 

After waiting around 30 minutes I finally see my manager walking through the doors, and what joy! The customer is walking right behind him with a smirk on his stupid ass face. 

The manager slows down for a second while the customer keeps walking past him and the manager proceeds to lock the door with his key.

Thats when I started to get worried. 

The customer was probably his brother or friend or some shit. Bracing myself to get beaten down by two fully grown men I watched them approach. 

The customer was the first one to speak. Do you even know who the fuck you just cussed out little bitch? Im the number one salesman at Electric Emporium. Im a fucking salesman too, and just because I asked you a question you decided to shame me in front of everyone else? Youre fucking worthless dude, and I cant wait to see you get fired for being a dumbass. I worked in sales for 4 and a half years dude. I know how to do sales. How long did you work in sales? Probably just a fucking seasonal worker or some shit. Have fun with unemployment.

For the first time ever, I saw my manager smiling behind the customer. 

Feeling humiliated I stare down at the ground and wait for my manager to fire me.

I keep staring at the ground until I hear the customer shouting and start running. When I look up I see the customer running towards the door with a bloody arm. My manager with a smile hands me a bloody knife and tells me that this will get me out of the funk I have been in. 

With rage pumping in my veins I run after the customer; hes a little faster than me as he runs past me and to the back of the warehouse. 

Oh well, I know Ill catch him sooner or later.

I just want to thank the store I work at and more than anything else my amazing manager.

I cant wait to continue working here now that my funk is [gone] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/?ref=bookmarks).

<TITLE> Please Don't Eat At A Place Called Tenderized For You </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-25 09:05:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I work at a semi-popular restaurant in the Midwest section of America. We serve probably the best tasting onion rings you will ever eat. I, personally, eat at least 2 orders worth of these onion rings a day. Believe it or not the ingredients are the same as any other onion rings, but we just add a little sprinkle of garlic powder.

I have worked here as the manager for around 2 years and as a cook for 8 years making it 10 years in total. So of course, if my store is doing good I feel like I am properly doing my job, and when the store is doing bad I feel like I should do anything possible to make more customers come in through the door. I am a fair manager, and I never ask my employees to do too much. Ive been in their shoes and the previous manager was a complete ass hole. It made me not want to keep working at times, and that is the reason why I have decided to be a lenient manager while still managing to get my employees to get all of the work done.

This being Christmas season we expect to receive in around a little over 120 thousand dollars of profit after the margins. If I hit the margin I feel good about the work Ive done; plus the extra bonus makes it even sweeter for me. 

The only thing is we have been completely dead. Around a week before Christmas we havent even broken the 50 thousand dollar mark. I knew it was the new restaurant that just opened up down the street from us around two months ago. Its called Tenderized For You and its been packed every single time I have even drove or walked past it. Over the two months they have been opened we have steadily lost business. Our once loyal customers have stopped showing up all of a sudden. 

So being the good manager I was I told my employees that they were all doing an amazing job despite the numbers, and I closed the restaurant down at 11 p.m. then walked to the other restaurant to see why they were so successful while we were completely failing. 


When I walked in I noticed the cheesy dcor of a stereotypical fast food restaurant. Red plushy chairs set in front of white thick plastic tables. The person behind the counter greets me with the generic Welcome to Tenderized For You would you care to try the Deluxe Patty Cheesy Melt? Astonished by how ridiculously the name of the sandwich sounds I ordered it with the combo. I asked for onion rings instead of the fries. 

Once they placed the tray of food on the counter I took a seat on the cheap red chair. I try an onion ring first to be immediately disappointed. Its somewhat soggy from the over use of oil and the onion is still somehow hard. Throwing the uneaten half onion ring back on my tray I took a bite of the burger. 

Holy. Fucking. Shit. 

It felt like I took a bite out of the meaning of life. The flavor of the burger immediately captured the attention of my taste buds, and before I knew it I have finished the whole burger in less than 5 minutes.

Completely bewildered by the taste of the burger I went back to the counter and ordered another one. After they placed my newly made burger on my tray I went back to my seat and scarfed it down before even giving it a second thought.

For the next five days I have ordered 2 of the Deluxe Patty Cheesy Melts after I got off of work. I have yet to figure out why the burger tastes so good, but like a traitor I have gone day after day without giving a second of regret. 

Today is the day that I know now why the burgers taste so good, but today is also the day that I will never eat a fucking burger from here again. 

When I went into the restaurant today I ordered the usual 2 burgers and decided to use the restroom before I start eating. As I am about to go through the bathroom door I notice the employee only door is open.

After debating with myself for 2 seconds I slowly open the door fully. There doesnt seem to be anyone there so I sneak past the grills in to the deep freezer in the back of the restaurant. 

When I peeked through the window on the freezer door I saw the guy that usually takes my order sitting in the middle of the floor cutting the fat off of a chunk of meat. When he turned it around I wasnt quite sure what kind of meat it was, but I kept watching. After he finished peeling all of the fat from the first hunk he brought out the next piece of meat. 

Vomit starts rushing through my throat as I notice that he has a human arm in his hands.

Running out of the restaurant I notice that the man is now in the front of the counter with a smile on his face waving at me. 

So here I am to warn everyone.

Dont every fucking eat at Tenderized For You.

They are using human fat to make their burgers taste so good.

I see the man standing outside of my window, and I know that a part of me will soon be in the mouths of their loyal customers.

Tenderized For You. Tenderized By Me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I Am Struggling To Live For More Than A Day </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-24 06:44:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was nineteen and my brother was twenty-five when he disappeared out of thin air. There wasnt a trace of him until around two months after he disappeared. He was found in the backyard of a house around 300 feet from the hotel we lived in by four men. He was found with his legs and arms torn off and circled around his body to form a gory heart with his head stuck in the gaping hole of his stomach and a smile on his face. 

My brother and I have been always close, and I truly loved him more than the rest of my family. Our father ran away when I was just seven and was never heard from again, and due to the stress of having two kids to care for and working 2 jobs back to back my mother was always a little too hard on us. Which made my brother and I form a strong bond that lasted all of the way to his death.

He has always been there for me no matter what, and when I found out that I had a bad liver at the age of 14 my doctor told me they had one available but because we did not have any insurance we would have to pay out of pocket. I knew we had zero chance to come up with 577 thousand dollars so I started to give up hope. Little did I know that my brother worked his ass off to fundraise every single dollar and come into the hospital with the proud smile I loved and after 6 days I was out of the hospital supported by my loving brother. When my mother died my brother took on 3 part time jobs so we could live in a hotel and have food to eat.

That is why when I found out how my brother was killed I wanted to get my revenge on the ass holes that took the only family I had. The police did not want to press charges on anyone until they had solid proof, but I knew that the house he was found at was the house of 4 men that he always had problems with. Ever since we were in school they kept tormenting us and like 4 ass holes no one wants to live with they got a house together so they could live jerking each other off.

With the gun in our safe I went to the house. Knocked on the door and when the 16 year old brother of one of the men opened the door I knocked him out with the butt of the gun. Entered in to the living room and placed bullets in each of their pathetic heads. After I admired the sight of their blood and brain matter on the wall and back of the couch I took my cell phone out and called the cops and reported my murder. 

I was charged the death sentence in court, and after a two year wait I was put to death through lethal injection.

Of course, I was sent to hell, but after walking towards the screams and wails from the fiery pit I was stopped by an angel. He told me he had a deal for me. The deal is that I will be placed in a body to live out whatever amount of life they have left. If I die in one body I will be placed in another body. The people are chosen through how suicidal they are so whatever body I jump into I will live with all of their depression and guilt. I dont know what happens to their soul, but I figure it is better than having to live with wanting to end your life constantly.

The first body I go into is the body of a 36 year old business man. Immediately Im hit with the guilt of killing my wife. The way I folded my fingers over her throat and watched the life drain slowly from her eyes. This just happened a little over ten minutes ago, and I have a gun in my hand. With the guilt bearing down on me I placed the gun in my mouth and squeezed the trigger. 

Before I know it I am now in the body of a 27 year old woman. I see myself coming into my house to finding my best friend having sex with my father. I remember the way my mother was hanging from the ceiling fan after she heard from me how my dad cheated on her. I remember how my father killed my best friend and then himself 2 months after my mother killed herself. With a sigh I place the rope down and try to go about living. I go outside and enjoy a cup of caramel macchiato. I watch a movie and laugh at all of the funny parts, but when I get back home the depression hits full force once again and I swallow a bottle of pills I use for my blood pressure. 

I find myself dreaming and it is a most beautiful dream. I am in the body of a 19 year old man and he is running through the fields with the love of his life. We go to a beautiful field full of flowers and I pluck one out and place it behind her ear. We kiss and I tell her how much I truly love her. I wake up feeling refreshed and to my horror see my fianc with her neck sliced open. The memory hit me of slicing her neck over an argument and then not wanting to believe what I did I placed her on the bed and went to bed hoping it was all a dream. Now realizing what i did i get hit with the feeling of both depression and guilt so hard that before I know it I have sliced each wrist and placed them into the rushing faucet water.

With the next body I write to you all before I kill myself once again. Please dont ever think you can justify killing anyone. No matter how right you think you are please dont think you can ever pass judgment of this caliber.

I sit here typing to you in the body of an 18 year old male. I am the brother of one of the men I killed, and the first memory I received was cutting the arms and legs of my brother. I remember using a tiny pocket knife to slowly slice the neck of my brother until his screams cease when I get halfway. I remember once I finish decapitating his head I tore his stomach open and shoved his head in the hole I created. With my index and middle finger I pulled each side of his lips up to form a smile. With his arms and legs I form a heart around his body,

For the first time I will end the life of my new body for the guilt and depression of both of our actions.

<TITLE> You Can Call It Vandalism, But I Love All Of My Writings </TITLE>

<TEXT> Ive always said that I wanted to be an author when I grew up, and with that in mind throughout almost my whole childhood I carried a pen and a notebook around wherever I went. My passion started to bring in attention when I was in college. It wasnt my papers that I turned into my English Professor, nor was it my submissions I made to the college newspaper. It was the stories I would leave in various hallways throughout campus for everyone to see, but I always kept my writings anonymous. 

In total I have created six writings all over campus, and with each story it definitely captures the attention of everyone.  I dont make a pattern of when I write, honestly, it is just when I am feeling inspired and when that feeling comes is when I know it is time to post another story. 

 I always have a helper, of course, to make sure there isnt anyone there when I post the stories, and to always make sure my writings have that extra kick by putting their input into it. I never use the same helper twice, never; I dont want them thinking they are a huge role in what I do. Thats how I stay anonymous and I still have yet to be caught. 

As you can see, no matter where I post the story it is still violating campus rules as they do not authorize my writings. They say what I write is far too gory, made from a disturbed individual, not suitable for the public, the list goes on, but so will my writings until I get caught. 

These past six months I was feeling extremely uninspired. So I decided to take a break, and I also need to find the perfect helper to help me post the story. Its almost impossible to find a helper that you know wont rat you out to the campus officials, and the helper must be very good at being quiet as we have to be as stealthy as humanly possible. 

Today my helper is Todd. He is in three of my classes this semester, and we have shared quite a bit of laughs and he has proven to be more than suitable for this job. As we walk together down the empty east side of campus I notice that there is just the most wonderful spot to place my new writing. 

We speed up towards the location and thats when Todd turns to me and finally says his first words to me tonight What the hell L, you scared the shit out of me dude! I thought I was being stalked by a lunatic! 

With a chuckle I tell him that I was just going to the hallway to grab the story I wrote this afternoon, and then ask him if he would like to proofread it for me really quickly. Like that nice guy Todd is he nods his head and once again we are walking together in to the hallway.

As he opens the door I use my knife to slowly penetrate the back of his head, and with my hand I cover his mouth to ensure he does not make too much noise. 

Now for my writing. 

With my knife that is my pen, and his face that is my blank piece of paper.

I write down.

Im Todd, and I have sex with helpless animals.

<TITLE> People are Getting Murdered Everyday, But I Just Want to Keep Singing </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-19 06:28:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One of the most popular things you can do in Korea is called Noraebangs which just means Singing Room in English. You pay 20 dollars an hour in the more prestigious locations or just 50 cents a song if you go to one of the ones in an arcade. 

The reason why it is so popular is because no matter how shitty you sing you will not get judged by others. Dont get me wrong. Im sure they judge you, but not in a way where you will see. I like to go to these rooms myself to just release stress by drinking and singing. 

Well I used to until a week ago. Two weeks ago the police have started finding dead people in those rooms with a random body part missing. Not really thinking much of it I decided to still go. I mean Id much rather face a slight risk than be stressed out of my mind the next day. 

So the next day I still head to my favorite singing room. For only 5 dollars at this location I can sing for an hour and they provide free popcorn as well. Plus they have 3 dollar bottles of cheap Korean liquor called Soju. Tastes like ass but gets me drunk from just one bottle so why the hell not?

Once I hand the 8 dollars to the guy in the front I head to the room that they assigned me. After logging in 9 codes to my favorite songs I pick up the microphone and start the night off with singing Mr. Brightside. 

Right when I am about to get halfway through the song a confused looking woman is standing in my doorway. Not wanting to stop singing I just gesture towards the part of the door that has the room number written on it and the number of the key that she is given. Shes just the next door over so I just put it off to her being confused. With a nod of her head and an embarrassed smile she closes my door and heads to the next room.

Before the next song starts I crap open the bottle of Soju and take a big swig. I smile when I hear that she is singing All Star in the next room as I remember when I used to sing it when I was much younger. After I finish my drink and the remaining songs I slightly stumble out of the room, and I head towards the subway station. 

The next morning I wake up with a slight headache so I go into the kitchen looking for a Tylenol and some water. I realize I left the TV on for god knows for how long, but its on the news so I leave it on wanting to see if anything else developed from these killings. 

Not really much in terms of them finding anything out, but they have found another body in one of the arcade ones. A male college student who was about to graduate this year was found with a stab in between his eyes and the lips have been cut off of his face. 

As the segment ends and moves on to Korean Baseball I know its about time I head off to work. 

Just another stressful and boring day of sitting in front of a computer and typing out whatever everyone else wants me to type out in English. Getting bitched out for being a worthless piece of shit is also another great fucking benefit I have working here as well!

 Another day at work makes it another day for a trip to my favorite spot in Korea. Well the only fucking place in Korea that still manages to give me joy now. I go back to my spot and make the same 8 dollar transaction I do every day and head to my room.

While walking to my room I notice the girl is singing in the room beside me again so I pop my head in and give her a smile. With a slight giggle she waves to me and keeps singing. I dont want to look like a fucking creep so I head to my room immediately after I wave back.

Just like today went the next three days went almost identically. 

The two things that changed, however, is the body counts. The first of the three days, there were 2 bodies in the same room. Both slashed from the neck to the top of their stomach and the left leg taken from one of them and the right leg taken from the other. All they knew about the two people was that they were coworkers for the same company.

The next day there were 8 people found with ripped open chests and 4 different teeth pulled out of their mouths. 

The last of the three days was the tamest with just one person. However, he was completely skinned from head to toe. The anchor said that when the police found him lying on the ground he realized that nothing else was missing from him. There was also nothing wrong with the state of his flesh so whoever did this is very skilled with the knife.

The Second thing that changed over the course of the three days is the girl that I keep bumping into at the Noraebang has decided to go on a date with me tonight. Of course, I kept going at the same time just to bump into her, and I finally got the courage to ask her out for tonight.

I put my very best suit on and I head off to her house. When I see her my jaw drops. I mean this lady is definitely beautiful. 

When we arrive at the restaurant we order simple salads and we rush through with the eating. We both know that what we really want to do together is finally sing together for the first time. We go to the spot where we first met and I pay the normal fee plus another 8 dollars for her fee as well. I nod at the man behind the counter as he smiles at me and we head to the room that she normally uses.

I suggest singing All Star and I see her face light up. So I plug the code in and we each take a microphone. The next 30 minutes is filled with joy as we keep taking turns picking songs until the 7th song ends and she gives me a face filled with such hatred.

You fucking stupid bitch. Is all she manages to say before stumbling onto my lap with a knife stuck in her chest.  I sit back and really marvel at how beautiful her eyes are. Pulling the knife out I carefully cut around her sockets until I can grab her eyes and rip them off of the optical nerves. 

As I leave the room I flash the eyes to the worker as he nods his head and hurries in to my room to make sure I did not leave even a spot of evidence. 

Now dont blame me for doing all of those killings.

This was just my contribution to our cause. We each provide a piece of a body, and we are given enough money to live a lot more comfortably than we all normally would be able to. 

I dont know who our boss is. I dont know why he/she would need the exact body parts to recreate another human. I just know where to leave the part that was assigned to me. 

We never know when we have another job or what general type of location we need to acquire it from, but what I do know is that we will always get it done.

<TITLE> The Christmas Present </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-15 04:40:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There has been a toy that has caught the attention of millions of people across the world. They are called hatchimals and are these toy eggs that you interact with until the actual toy animal pops out of the egg, and they are now almost impossible to find in stores. 

Flipping through Amazon only frustrates me more as I realize that the cheapest ones are going for around $180, and there is no way that my meager salesman salary will be able to cover that expense. Its just that my son really wants one, and I need to keep looking for one that I will be able to afford no matter how long it takes. 

Im about to give up for the night until I find a craigslist ad for a hatchimal for just $59 dollars. I look through the ad and find out that its some Good Samaritan that has bought 50 of them knowing that they will sell out quickly, and is now selling them for the same price he got them for.  Filled with joy I text the number that was listed on the page, and with my laptop I head to my bedroom to show my wife the great deal I managed to find. 

The person does not text me until the next morning. While Im eating breakfast I see a text from him saying that he does indeed have some left, and he is willing to meet me at the Red Lobster that is just down the road from me. So I text him back saying I can be there with the cash in 20 minutes. Once Im done getting ready for work I head out and park at the Red Lobster. 

After waiting for about 7 minutes I see a man in his 40s step out of a bright yellow truck. I get out of my car to greet him and notice that he has a prosthetic right arm and his face is littered with cuts. I mind my manners and shake his left arm thanking him for being so generous at this time of year. With minimal words he states that I should get my money out as he pulls the box with the green hatchimal out of his truck and extends his prosthetic arm out signifying that he wants my money.

Im feeling just a bit confused, but I take my wallet out and give him three twenties and told him to keep the one dollar change. With a nod and a quick thank you he gets back in to his truck and drives out of the parking lot. 

I cant help but feel like it was some sort of scam, but Im already running late for work now so I just head off to store I work at. 

With it being holiday season our store is bustling with business, and before I know it I have met the sales goals for today and its time to go back home. While Im driving back home I realize that I completely forgot to wrap the present so I stop by the local Walmart and get a Christmas bag with some Christmas themed tissue paper. 

Before I put the hatchimal into the bag I check it over to make sure that its real. Comparing to what I have in my hand and what is on the picture on my phone I quickly determine that its real and the guy was just fucking creepy. 

Once I got home I showed my wife the toy and she insisted that we just give our son the gift now. I mean hes eight and its all hes been talking about for the last month so we know he would appreciate getting his toy quicker, and on Christmas we can just give him the little gifts that we had already gotten him. When he received his toy his face lit up and he gave us both a hug and kisses on the cheek. Ripping open the box he started petting the egg and the egg was making slight interactions with him back. 

Five days before Christmas was when it finally hatched revealing a tiny purple and blue owl with a tiny horn on top of its head. He automatically started petting it and caring for it as if it were a pet and we knew that he truly loved it. 

After a couple of days of him petting it and carrying it around everywhere we heard the hatchimal start singing happy birthday, and we knew that it was finally getting to the Toddler stage of the toy. This is the stage that you will teach it how to walk, play games, and just a bit more functionalities. 

Thats when I started noticing that the toy has now started to follow my son everywhere he goes. Tonight I told him we were eating dinner in the living room to watch a Christmas movie he raced down and took a seat at the couch. When my wife and I came into the living room with our dinner we noticed the hatchimal was halfway up the couch. I asked my son if he brought it downstairs with him, but all he said was it followed him down. So I just grabbed the toy and placed him in the kitchen out of reach from my son and came back in to the living room. 

Once the movie ended I took him upstairs and brushed his teeth then sent him to bed. It wasnt until around 1 in the morning when my wife and I decided to head to bed. As Im passing my sons bedroom I notice hes still up and carrying on a conversation. I open the door and peek in to see him petting his hatchimal and talking to him in the dark. Sneaking in I hear the hatchimal telling my son to sneak out of his house and to go to the end of the street. That scares me, but rage fills every part of my body as I realize that the voice is of the man that sold me the fucking toy.

Ill head out the fucking door.

Ill be at the end of the street.

Merry Christmas Mother Fucker.

<TEXT> With the sound of change jingling in my pockets I race out of my mommas car and into the best cookie store in the whole wide world! 

Every day if I am a good boy and I do all of my chores my papa gives me a quarter, and at the end of the month they take me to the cookie store where I can spend all day eating cookies and reading the books I take to the store! The owner of the cookie store sees me come in once a month so he brings me free lemonade throughout the day too!

As I start getting into my book a man sits in front of me and tells me Im a very good looking young man. So I remember my manners and tell the man thank you. Im twelve years old, but a lot of people have already called me a very good looking person so the compliment does not make me as happy as it used to. 

I ask the man what his name is, and he tells me that his name is Jonah and that he has a wonderful game room in his house. He said he has all of the newest game systems and all of the games, with a humongous TV, and all the snacks I could possibly want! Wow! He must be very rich to have all of that stuff. I only have a small TV at home, and I only get around 5 channels on it so thats why I read a lot of books.

Im only halfway through my second cookie so I offered the man one of my other cookies. He declines my cookie saying that he has plenty of snacks to eat back at home, and he offers to take me over to his house to play video games and eat as many cookies with ice cream as I would like.

I dont want to waste any of the cookies I already have so I ask the man if he can give me around an hour so I can finish my book and the rest of my cookies. He says its fine and that he can wait for me to finish.

He keeps telling me what a good looking boy I am while Im trying to read and it gets a little annoying so I tell him that I am happy to get compliments, but I would like some time to read my book and that he is distracting me. After being quiet for around 20 minutes he starts to try and hold my hand, but every time he brings his hand to mine I act like Im flipping the page in my book.

After he manages to grab my hand and starts rubbing it with his finger is when I tell him to stop touching me or I will not be going over to his house. I guess he finally understood that I would like to have some type of privacy while I read and eat my cookies because he finally decided to do something on his phone. 

When I am finally done with my book and cookies I notice that it was 4 p.m. so I tell the man that I am ready to go over to his house now. 

He jumps out of his chair excitedly and talks about how much fun we are going to have while we exit the store. The owner of the cookie shop gives me a questionable look but I just give him a smile and a nod.

I smile while I think to myself how much fun I will have with him while we walk out of the store. I laugh when I know today is going to be a good day while we walk onto the parking lot. I scream with glee when my daddy comes behind the man and shoves him into our van. 

Does not take long for us to be on the road as my momma is a very good driver and we manage to peel out of the parking lot and onto the streets. By the time we get on the highway we already have the mans mouth taped over and the skin of his arms peeled off. The rest of the skin is easy to peel off now so we both grab our knives and make sure all of his skin is gone by the time we get home. 

Once we get home my daddy and I chop the hands and the feet off because we dont like eating those parts so I threw them in to the fire. Then we have to cut right in the middle of each elbow, then shoulder, take the guts and organs out of his midsection, pull the ribs out. That all goes into the stew that we make. The meat found on the back, chest area (with the heart and organs taken out of course), and legs all make for a wonder pan fried meal. 

I may be twelve, but I know what a fucking creep is. I know that he is evil for wanting to do unspeakable things to me. That is why every month I go to the cookie store. That is why the cookie store owner is a very good friend of ours. He has the same taste as us. So he finds people that are looking for good looking boys like me and tells them to come to his shop so they can take me home with them.

<TITLE> Our Town is Blessed </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-12 11:57:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My name is Jeremy and I live in a small town in Mississippi. Im just your average sized male at 5 foot 11 inches. I own a farm where I am blessed with an abundance of animals. They are all well fed, and I make sure they are as happy as can be.

We have around 200 to 225 people living in our community. Unlike the rest of the world we live by a certain set of rules. We do not condone to any kind of adultery, women listen to what the man says, and children stay quiet until they are asked a question. We have other rules, but its all pretty much common sense from there. If the sin is harsh enough they must be punished with death. 

We still have technology in our community, but we are not able to have anything that allows us to communicate to anyone on the outside of our town. Cars are allowed but no one has a car due to the fact that you can walk anywhere you want to in less than half an hour. Last but not least at the end of the month we all gather together to the great fire pit for our sacrifice. As all of the great people in the Bible the Lord requires us to give up some portion of our earnings. I have always tossed my largest animal so that He may keep bestowing upon me His blessings. 

I have a beautiful 3 bedroom ranch right in the middle of the town. My animals are all in the backyard fenced in so they are not able to leave my farm or get stolen. Every morning when I wake up I pray to the Lord thanking him for everything he has done for me, afterwards I go to my kitchen where I use only the best cuts of meat to eat with my eggs and toast. The butcher shows up usually right when I finish breakfast to pick up any animal of his choosing. Then I go for my daily walk around town. After my walk I go back to care for my animals and take an afternoon nap. 

Once I wake up I wait till the butcher arrives with a large loaf of bread and enough meat cooked to complete perfection to last till tomorrow afternoon. Once I am finished eating I go outside and I throw an assortment of vegetables provided by my wonderful garden and watch as the animals fight over the food. Now it is time for our towns mandatory 2 hour prayer to the Lord.   Where we must sit outside of our house no matter what weather and spend the time praying for forgiveness of whatever bad thoughts or wrong doings we have done throughout the day.

When the prayer time is over I go back inside and reheat the meat and make a salad for dinner. Bed time for me comes right after I finish my dinner as I need to get up early in the morning. 

That is what I do every day, and it is the perfect life for me. 

The only day that is different is the last Saturday of every month. This is the day we give the Lord our sacrifice. As I have said before I go to my farm and pick the biggest animal I have and walk it to the fire pit. The animal always put up a fight and makes this horrid high pitch noise, but I have always managed to throw it in month after month. As I watch the eyeballs of the beast burst into liquefied goo I laugh, as the skin melts off of the flesh I join in the dancing with the other townspeople. Just when it turns into a black piece of stump is when the sacrifice is over and we head back to our houses to rest.

One fine day I step out of my house to realize that I am extremely low on animals. I start to worry about what I am going to say to the butcher as he will definitely notice how low I am. Everyone in our town will be ashamed to know that I have failed them as a provider of meat for them all. I know God must have a plan so I kneel in front of my farm and I pray for a miracle.

As I open my eyes I am filled with joy! I see a multitude of animals coming right up to my farm! They make their normal noises like Sir, our bus is being repaired by your mechanic, but we are all very hungry. The mechanic told me to go to you and you could give us a meal. I nod my head yes and lead them into my house. Just a bit of Rohypnol mixed into each of their bowls of meat stew and I see every single one of them droop their heads and begin to drop their bowls and spoon on the ground. 

This gives me 45 minutes to get them ready for my farm. First the tongues must be sliced off so that they may not proceed with their evil sayings and produce further blasphemy to the Lord. Then I must drive a metal rod from the front side of their thighs to the ankle and bend each part down so that they may not walk astray from the Lord anymore. Lastly, a smaller metal rod will start from the bottom of the wrist to the bottom of the bicep and bent down each way to avoid them from further sins the twisted animals mind can think up of doing.

The Lord has provided us for months all because we do as he asks. We are not lead down the path of sin, and we always keep our faith to the Lord. The animals may sound like I do, but I know that deep down inside it is merely an animal. That is why I have my farm. 

So that they may produce something good out of their lives.

I am blessed, my town is blessed, are you blessed? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Be Careful What You Pray For </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-11 11:10:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ive always been a semi religious person. Basically, I share the same belief as Christians, but refuse to go to church. I just never saw the need to be forced to sing, pray, and converse with people that I would usually avoid like the plague in public. 

Plus the fact that I whole heartedly believe in evolution and that there are beings beyond Earth cause most Christians to cringe. Having a whole Sunday off for myself has always been completely fine by me.

Unfortunately, next week is this special service for my mother and father because they are getting ordained or some shit. Being the good son I am I decided to go with them. 

The service is just like every other service. Sing the same songs about how much we are in love with Jesus; which makes me seriously wonder whether its a religious song or just some sappy love song. Then time for everyone to turn to John 45: I dont fucking remember and read it out loud all together. Then my favorite part! The time where we all listen to a person on a podium and talk about how if we dont take Jesus show of love we are all going to get our skin and flesh melted off of in some endless pool of molten lava. 

After the sermon is over we all bow our heads and get time to pray for our own prayer requests. That is when I first laid my eyes on what has made me obsessed with going to every single church I possibly can. Its really hard to describe what it looked like even though he was floating right on top of the person in front of me, but just think an angel with tattered clothing. 

His body was completely normal except he had a swirling mass of black goo for a right hand, and a small shining body of light instead of a left hand. His face was stretched out longer than anyone I have ever seen. His lips were impossibly stretched out to produce the saddest look I have ever seen.  His eyes were solid white on his left side while his right eye was the darkest black you could imagine. His forehead ended in a curve making his face end touching the middle of his back. As the man started asking for the new promotion he really wanted the being slowly touched his head with his right hand and with a look of great depression passed to the next person.

He proceeded to pass by everyone and touched them with his right hand or his left hand. When he got to my parents he touched both of them with his left hand. Once he got to me he just stayed in front of me for around 2 seconds and proceeded to pass me without touching me with his left hand or his right. Made me wonder why he just passed by me I realized I was not praying. I looked around the church to see if anyone else noticed this ugly piece of shit touching everyone, but even the people that have stopped praying did not seem to notice a thing out of the ordinary.

Once the service is over I decide to go back home and research about what I just saw, but all I got out of Google is that Im some delusional fuck. Absolutely nothing about it, and I decided to just completely ignore what I just saw. 

The next week is complete agony for me as I cant even take my mind off of what I just saw. The impossibility of the shape of his face and the look of pure sadness puts me at a constant depressed mood. I know for a fact that he was there listening to everyones prayers and either approving them or disapproving them with a touch of either his left of right hand. In the middle of the week my parents got approved for a much needed loan for them to set up a new church so I know that the being has some sort of ability to make peoples prayers come true.  

I dont know much else about it, but I know my mind wont be at rest until I figure out exactly why its doing what it does and what is leading it to receive such torment doing so. So when Sunday rolls around I decide to go to a different church to see if I can see him once again. After the singing and the sermon is over this pastor allows people to come to the front of the church to kneel down and pray. Once again, I see the figure come in and with the same look of depression goes by each person and touches them with one of his deciding hands.

I see one of my work colleagues in the front and I wait to see which hand he will be touched by. Once I see him touched by his left hand I start to wonder what exactly he was praying for. After the sermon I go out to greet him and he looks surprised to see me at his church. We go through the formalities and we say our goodbyes and I head back home. 

I decide to just stop thinking about everything and relax before having to go spend another week at work. So I just order some food and pop in some movies. Before I know it morning has arrived and I start getting ready to work. Once I reach the store that has graced me with the opportunity to sell electronics I notice 4 police cars parked outside. 

I look inside to see my manager has been literally torn to shreds by God knows what. The only way I can tell it was my manager was by the name tag that was attached to a piece of our uniform accompanied by a bit of skin and chunks of meat on top of the camera display. What was identified as his head looked like a deflated red dodge ball. His eyes were torn out of his socket, his nose just a crushed mush, and mouth gaping open as if he was stuck in a permanent blind scream. 

I cant bear to look any longer so I just head back home knowing that we will not be working at all. Our store was closed for the next three days, and all I did during that period of time was lie on the couch and order pizza continuously.

On Thursday I go back to work, and we have a little team meeting before we open. The new announcement was that the coworker I saw at church has now become the new manager. He looks deathly pale as he hears the news and looks as if hes about to faint. After the meeting I go up to him and congratulate him as well as ask if he would like to go get lunch with me on break. He accepts luckily.

While we are at lunch I ask him why he looked like he was about to faint. His response to me brought chills all over my body. Well the thing is, remember last Sunday? Okay, that day I was at the front of the church and I prayed that I can somehow get a better position or get a raise. I just never expected that to happen like that. I tell him maybe it was just a coincidence it happened like that. I wanted to tell him what i saw but I just dont want him to think Im crazy when I tell him what I started seeing at church. We resume our lunch and right as we are about to finish he looks up at me and tells me one last thing. You know after I was done praying I felt a warm presence in front of me. I honestly thought it was God giving me the assurance that what i was asking for will indeed happen.

Thats when I decided to make it a personal mission of mine to figure this shit out. 

Once the work day ends I go back home to see my mother parked outside of my house sobbing in her car. I go up to the car and she flies out and clings on to me as if her life depended on it. Once I manage to calm her down we go inside and she sits quietly on my couch. After 5 minutes of awkward silence she looks up at me and tells me that after just 10 days of getting approved for the loan. My father was so overcome by the stress of everything he decided that his one dream was just an impossibility. Knowing he had no turning back from it he decided to shoot himself in his bedroom. My mom came in after a prayer meeting to my find my fathers blown out skull and brain matter all over the bed sheets.

I have yet to figure out what this demented little bitch is, but I will figure it out.

Just please take my warning.

Be careful what you pray for.

<TITLE> Have you Tried Vaping? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-10 10:41:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If you had asked me three weeks ago I would have told you that vaping is by far the dumbest fad to hit the stores. Well not as bad as those so called hoverboards, but pretty damn close. 

I did not see the point in sucking on a metal stick and blowing out far more smoke than is necessary. The only real reason why I bought it two weeks ago was to smoke it indoors when I dont feel like going outside and braving the harsh cold winter. Plus everyone I know started to get vapes so I thought. What the hell, and decided to use it just during the winter and keep it in my closet till the next winter.

It really didnt take me long to become completely infatuated by this device. I mean the flavors you can get for this thing is absolutely incredible! Blueberry cheesecake and vanilla make smoking feel like youre merely eating desert rather than taking in the much needed nicotine my body craves. I started smoking more of my vape and far less cigarettes. 

After a week of smoking the vape it has gotten to where I no longer need to smoke cigarettes. It feels like complete freedom when I can go into my restroom at work and smoke to my hearts content and leave the restroom with it smelling better than when I got in it.

I cant help but continuously talk about vaping to everyone I know now. I will talk about it with my family members telling them that I am no longer taking in anything that is harmful to my body other than nicotine and how my life is starting to get better. 

I know its starting to become an obsession when I bought my 11th vape, but I have yet to regret any of those purchases. Its a good obsession, and I am just so glad to have found out about it instead of living with such a closed mind.

 I mean I dont smell like cigarettes anymore so my boss is much happier to stand around and talk to me now. So I just had to tell him how amazing it is that I am now vaping. He seemed confused by what that was so I took him outside and took a hit from my vape and blew it right in his face. After getting over the shock he was surprised by how good it smelled so I did not get into any trouble for doing that.

He allows me to smoke my vape in my office now, and I simply couldnt be happier. My friends that started vaping before me are now applauding at the fact that I have started too, and we now get together and one of our houses and watch movies and just vape the night away.

Imagine my surprise when my boss came into my office blowing a thick cloud of smoke! Simply amazing when I see someone doing something I am so passionate about. He said that he just could not stop thinking about how amazing it smelt and he was so curious about how it tastes he decided to go out and buy one himself. Which, of course, he does not regret doing at all!

Its been two months since I start vaping and I realized that every single breath I take now I am breathing out smoke. Which I dont mind at all because I can now constantly taste the wonderful caramel and coffee mix I started using. I just hope people dont get insulted with having smoke blown in their face every time they talk to me.

The only thing that pisses me right the fuck off is the fact that my so called friends are now excluding me from every little gathering they are having. I mean Im doing everything they like to do with them! I laugh, scream, cry, or freak out over the same scenes they do, and most of all I blow out vape smoke with them constantly. 

Inconsiderate as fuck.

I know exactly why they stopped asking me to come over. They are probably weirded out about the smoke that continuously comes out of my mouth. 

Another thing, my fucking boss fired me after telling me that he is tired of being reminded about how amazing vaping is continuously. Just another person tired of seeing me expelling vape smoke out of my mouth. 

So it is due time I get back at everyone for not only insulting me, but for insulting the very thing I love. I go up to my ex bosses car after getting fired and I wait for him to get into the car. Six whole hours but its worth it. When he gets into his car I shove a vape all the way down his throat and tape his mouth shut. Afterwards ripping his throat open with his tie clip and grab a bottle of vape juice and proceed to pour it in his exposed throat drip by drip. Take out my pocket knife and slowly slice down from his throat to where his chest meets his stomach. Rip out his right ribs and once I spot his exposed heart I shove another vape into it. Maybe now he can love vapes as much as I do.

My three friends shortened my time for any type of fun, because once I rammed into their house one of them had the fucking genius idea to automatically call the cops. Quickly and swiftly use the knife to pounce on my first friend as the other two run out the door and I start taking hits off my vape and CPR style blowing it into his mouth as I slowly cut both of his ears off. I remember he always told me that he was starting to get annoyed at how much I talked about vaping. After I slice his ears off and is expelling smoke continuously like me I slowly shove the knife in each canal of his ears and shove it in as far as the knife goes to make sure I rip his eardrums. 

Before I leave I grab a vape and shove it in to his right ear and use the knife to shove it into the middle of his head. Grab his ears with another vape and shove the items right into his mouth and tape it all in. 

Ill get to my other two friends soon. 

Dont insult what people love. Its just completely rude. 

Just have an open mind.

While youre at it. Why not start vaping too? Its just the greatest thing in the world!

I truly promise you will not regret it.

Not even one bit.

<TITLE> Fun Challenges in Korea </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-09 10:10:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Whenever I have any type of free time I like to indulge in my favorite hobby of all time. Seeing what people will do for money. Ive gotten quite good at convincing people to do things by offering a good amount of money while having a camera and a microphone claiming its for a YouTube Video.

Im currently in South Korea so the only hard part is to find a foreigner that is good at speaking English. Luckily, there is a park nearby my house where a lot of foreign teachers will walk around and meet other people that speak their native tongue.

Today a man in his late 20s caught my eye so I decided to approach him. 

Hows it going man? My name is B and Im filming for a YouTube video. Do you have some spare time?

Of course he says yes and asks which channel Im posting the video. I give him my business card with my YouTube channel name on it and we are ready to proceed with the fun!

Alright sir what is your name?

James. 

Great! The first challenge for $50 is extremely easy just tell a random person you love them.

Its silly but there are people who are not able to complete this challenge. 

However, he without hesitation goes up to the closest woman and tells her he loves her. Afterwards, he quickly explains that this was for a YouTube video which makes it annoying because its just another thing for me to edit out.

On to the next challenge!

For $200 dollars the challenge varies depending on the person. For him I decided to make him go up to a random guy and hold his hand for at least 10 seconds. 

Without giving it a second thought he goes up to the first guy that walks past him and grabs his hand. Out of pure shock the guy holds onto James hand without trying to let go of his hand for seven seconds. After that the man tries to struggle out of James hand, but James manages to hold on for the remainder three seconds.

When I hand James the money he quickly gives the man a hundred dollars out of it and the man seems completely satisfied about the extra hundred dollars.

Its crazy what people will do for money.

Good job James! Now for the third challenge for $500 you have to remove an article of clothing from anyone that passes us. 

This time he is not so quick with the challenge. While people pass by I can see the hesitation on his face as he tries to quickly think what would be the easiest thing to take off.

After 10 minutes of waiting I tell him he needs to find someone in the next 2 minutes as I believe he has had several great opportunities hes passed by.

Lucky for him the third person to pass by after that was a lady wearing a scarf so without second thought he rips the scarf off of her. 

Stunned, she just stares at James while I hand him $500 dollars. James, the nice guy he is hands her a hundred dollars and explains it was just for a YouTube video.

Youre fucking killing me James. Thats another spot for me to edit out but at least he completed the challenge. It is now time for the final challenge.

M- Hey James, are you free all day tomorrow?

J- Yeah, I have an off day at work today and tomorrow.

M- Well the last challenge will take some time so we will have to go tomorrow if youre up for it!

J-Alright man, whats the challenge?

M-  There is a mountain called the Namsan about 3 miles away from us. Im sure you have heard of it. Well I want you to wear some shorts and a t-shirt and climb that mountain with me!

J- Ah fuck that dude. Im not trying to freeze to death man.

M- I can assure you that you wont freeze to death! Plus its the last challenge. This is for $5000. I know you cant turn down that money!

The money always helps. People will pretty much do anything for $5000. They may say they never will, but when they are put in that position they will always take the deal.

The next morning I meet James at the same spot and we get in my car and head off to the mountain. Its only a 15 minute drive through traffic so I just share some small talk with him. 

Learned quite a bit about him.

He moved to Korea to teach English. 

He moved here with his wife, but they dont have any kids yet.

His wife also teaches English, but for some extra cash she works some hours at a local coffee shop.

Thats why he decided to do these challenges as well as climb the mountain in summer wear. So she can quit her job and they can spend some more time together.

Stories like his completely warm me up. I mean he loves his wife so much that he is willing to sacrifice his own body and health. 

Well we start heading up the mountain and right away I can see how cold he is. We are at the bottom of the mountain and its already 28F. 

I start to feel bad for him so I decide to break my own rules and give him my extra coat. When we start reaching the top is when I turn the camera back on while I take the coat back from James. 

Once we reach the top we exchange high fives, and I tell him to do some jumping jacks to warm up while I get a fire started. I always take a bag with three logs and several boxes of matches. He takes my suggestion and starts doing some exercises to get him warmed up.

I take that opportunity to take out my hunting knife and jam it in the middle of his back. Slicing down I can see how his spinal cord is separating away from the back muscles and ribs. I cant look him in the face as I do it because I can feel the look of betrayal on his face. 

Once I reach the bottom of his back I slice his neck to make sure he dies quickly. Once, I make sure hes dead I cut a small piece of his bicep off. Put it on a stick and place it over the fire. While thats cooking I have to skin him and separate the skin from his face from the rest. Then take a picture of the facial skin placed over my face as I take a bite of his cooked bicep.

Cut up the rest of his body that can be eaten and bury the rest of the scraps.

Am I a cannibal? No. 

I do have a delivery I have to make tomorrow.

Like I said. 

Its crazy what people will do for money.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So today started like every other day. Woke up, got out of bed, brushed my teeth, stared at myself in the mirror for about 3 minutes, made breakfast, ate the breakfast, used my key to unlock my front door, locked my front door, and headed to work. I live in a pretty unsafe neighborhood so I have to always remember to lock my doors and make sure all of my windows (which are luckily pretty much unbreakable unless you fire a pistol directly at it) are locked as well.

I work at an office so the mundane schedule of my life continues throughout the whole day.

I am currently mapping out how a website needs to look, and then sending those to the design team so they can start creating the website. Its kind of weird how theyre called the design team, but they actually dont really do any designing themselves.

Anyways, I work on that all the way till its time for lunch. Our lunch takes place in a cafeteria type setting where every little business that works around it gets to eat there for a low price of roughly 3 dollars. (I work in Korea so its hard to guess the exchange rate right.) The food there is always shitty, but I cant really complain because of the price.

We get an hour off during our lunch break so after lunch I always check my phone for the remaining 25 minutes of my break. As soon as I turn on my phone I notice I have a notification for a picture uploaded to my Facebook account.

Strange. I honestly dont remember uploading any pictures so I open up Facebook to see which picture uploaded.
What the fuck.

Its just a picture of my living room.

When I get back to my office I get another notification for a picture uploaded to my account.

Its a picture of my bedroom with what looks to be blood on my bed sheets.

It doesnt take long before people start messaging me asking what the hell is going on, and it takes over an hour to explain to everyone that Im fine. Im in my office, and Ill figure out everything when I get home. My mother messaged me asking if she should call the cops, and I tell her its fine. Its probably some prankster who was in my house before and decided to spook me while Im at work.

I decide that Ive had enough of these uploads so I change the id and password to my account. Luckily for me I only have Facebook. Ive never really gotten into the other Social Media Websites.
I know most people would panic at this point, but for me there really is no reason for me to panic. I mean, I have an ungodly amount of locks on my doors, and all of my windows are completely bulletproof. I swear I could get through the purge in this house. So theres no way anyone could get in.

Its 2 p.m. now so only four more hours to go before I can go home. There hasnt been another disturbance on my Facebook in the past two hours so I start to calm down.

Get back to work on the website and before I know it 6 p.m. has arrived. I need to pick up some milk and eggs on the way home so I stop by my local grocery store.

Its 7:30 by the time I get home and as I unlock the door I see a figure in the doorway. I cant help but gasp at a man missing both hands and feet. The wrists are oozing out blood but the scabs around the blood are old. His nose has been stapled downwards and each side of his mouth has been sewn together leaving only a small space to open his mouth. Ears have been cut off only to be replaced by the ears of a stuffed animal.

Im fucking shocked. I mean what the fuck.

How did my pet fucking manage to get out of the basement?

I swear pets are getting smarter every day.

Like I said.

Im safe inside of my house.

No one can sneak into my house or sneak out of my house. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Don't Trust Glenn </TITLE>

<TEXT> 
I have been working with mentally ill patients here in Jeju Island, South Korea for around 20 years now. The patient that was rushed through the doors here recently is by far the most disturbed individual I have ever worked with. I am posting on his account, because I am deeply disturbed by everything he has written. 


The first day he came in after his life saving surgery was a meeting full of awkward glances and silence. Im a therapist. I know. I should be able to deduce something out of the silence, but Im at a complete loss. 


Towards the end of the session he starts muttering some sort of gibberish that I simply cant understand. I sigh inwardly and write what the fuck in my notebook to completely summarize this meeting. 


I thank him for his time and he just proceeds to lay back down onto his hospital bed. 


This is what I know about him so far. His name is Glenn. He works for a company that organizes conferences and events. He killed his manager that was staying at the same room as him. He came into the hospital yelling and screaming about deaths and a strange itch. 


The only death that has occurred during that conference was his manager, and he shows zero signs of skin irritation. Besides the massive hole and the missing man parts there was nothing wrong with him when he came into the hospital.


Completely horrible what he did to his manager though. 


His manager was nothing but a mass of flesh when the paramedics arrived. The throat was torn out of him and his spine was halfway out of his backside. His midsection was a jumbled mess of smashed organs and intestines. His thighs were mostly sliced off by a pocket knife. The meat that was sliced off his thighs was then stuck on top of the spinal cord.


The worst part of it all was that his eyes were both taken out and he used that as an entry port to his brain. His head was gashed open utilizing that entry point, and the brain was removed from his skull. 


They found the brain hanging from the inside door knob.


Thats why Im here. I have by far the most experience out of anyone else here and I also know English at a competent level. 


Second Day of our sessions and hes still blankly staring down at the floor. So I start asking him random questions about his job, his family life, his favorite food, anything to get him to talk. I have realized that the most basic questions tend to make anyone talk. No matter how fucking psychotic they are. Yet, he still keeps staring down at the floor and whispering gibberish to himself quietly.


Im about to give up hope so I just write my final comments down on my notepad when I look up to see him staring at me as if Im some slice of thigh meat that failed to stake myself on top of a spinal cord. Not saying anything to me at all but just staring at me blankly and still muttering to himself.


I still see that as some type of progress so I end the session there and once again thank him for his most valuable time. He goes back to his bed and proceeds to lie down.


His nurse comes in and lays a tray of food on his bed and tells him its lunch time. He keeps staring at his food blankly without any thought of picking up the spoon to begin eating. His nurse then tells me that he has not eaten a single thing or has drunk a single thing. 


I guess her telling me this information has angered him because he grabs the tray of food and flings it at the TV screaming one single word. DIRTY! Then laying back down acting as if nothing happened at all. 


Fucking weird kid.


Third Session he is completely fixated with me. He has not taken his eyes off of me for even a single millisecond. He keeps muttering, but this time I thought ahead and brought a little microphone to clip on to his collar. This way even though he doesnt respond back to me I can still maybe get a couple of my questions answered. 


I still, however, try to get him to talk by giving him some more generic questions, but of course I am not getting a single response. I did notice that he has started to obsessively scratch his right arm, and hes beginning to bleed where hes scratching so hard so I make a note for his nurse. While Im writing down the note Glenn finally says a phrase that makes sense to me.


You do not know whats going to happen.


I ask him what he meant by that, but he just closed his mouth and started shaking his head at me. I write down what hes said and told him that this session is over and we will continue the next session tomorrow. 


I give his nurse the note when she gets back with his food and I leave before he chucks his dinner anywhere near me. 


I go back home and watch some TV while I eat my leftovers from the night before. I cant help but keep thinking about what he said earlier. What does he honestly think will happen? If I can just figure that out I can easily put together why he did those horrific acts.


I wake up to a series of texts coming into my phone.


These are the texts from the nurse. 


Hey are you awake? I went into Glenns room and his restrictions are torn off. Hes in the restroom now just curled up into a ball.


Can you come over here? Hes not moving at all. He just keeps saying I found a new body over and over again.


Ive called the cops. Theyre coming now, but I really think you should get over here. Hes acting really strange but I feel like hes trying to tell me something.


Fuck. I get out of my pajamas and get into a shirt and some pants and rush out to the hospital. There are cop cars littered about the hospital, and I cant help but fear the worst.


As I step out of the elevator I see cops standing outside of his room. I walk up to the room and look inside. The nurse is lying in the middle of the room with chunks taken out of her. There are two doctors sitting next to her telling her she will be fine and to stay calm. Listen is all she can do as her eyes are sitting right next to her on the floor. The oddest thing about it all is that on her chest there is a series of deep gashes to spell out. Not good, Dirty.


Where the fuck is Glenn?


I ask the police officers and they are saying that they are still trying to find him. When they got there all they saw was the nurse lying on the floor with a scalpel lodged in the right side of her chest. 


No one can seem to find him, and theyve had people searching for him everywhere. They only had a skeleton crew at the time so security was at a minimum. Of course, when they look on the cameras they can see Glenn as he rushes past each camera and finally going past the camera that is pointing towards the entrance.


Not much for me to do here now. So I head back home. I just want to sleep and get this night out of my head.


I get to my house and I go into my kitchen to grab some cereal, but what stops me dead in my tracks is that on the counter I found a bloody plastic spoon.


For Glenns account of last week.

<TEXT> For Part 3 : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5g92uz/please_help_me_part_3/

This is finally the last day of the conference and I cant begin to explain how happy I am to finally get through this hellish week. One can only stomach so many deaths.

Today we had by far the smallest turnout. The total participants now totaling a pathetic count of 361 people. 

We are going with a lighter schedule due to the fact that the participant count is so low as well as people fucking dying left and right, but you know half day. Yay.

Today seems like it's going to be somewhat of a decent day. The only thing bugging me now is that I have this annoying itch on the top section of my forehead. A quick scratch will make it go away, but within twenty minutes that same spot will be disturbed by the same itch. Not really a big deal since I'm not scratching as bad as the other remaining participants, and I'm not really sure the itching even had anything to do with the intestine cuisine lovers.

 After the first two meetings it's time for the coffee break. I take the meager amount of participants to the coffee break area, and I grab a coffee for myself. Coffee has been a very big reason why I haven't fucking lost my shit after everything that happened in the past week.

I go back to the office after I finish my coffee and make sure all of the participants are happy with their coffee and tea. 

God this fucking itch.

It's starting to get really annoying.

It has gotten to the point to where scratching will make the itch go away. Seriously. No. Matter. How. Much. I. Fucking. Scratch. it stays there and it will not go away. 

Have you ever had an itch on your eyelid that is so bad that you have to rub the everlasting shit out of your whole upper face region?

I have even tried the good ol open my eye as much as my little Korean eyes can open and poke the area that is causing me this grief and torment.

So now Im going to do the only rational thing I can think of.

Luckily I have a pair of scissors and two perfectly good hands to complete this little operation.

Good news.

The itch is finally gone.

Bad news.

My face is not as symmetrical as it once was.

But seriously.

Who gives a flying fuck.

I got rid of the itch!

I start to finally feel like I see the light at the end of the tunnel. One more meeting and we are finally over. 

FInal meeting is finally over, and the conference is finally over without me having to see the insides of another person. 

Time to finally go back to the hotel and finally relax.

The manager and I get into our car and drive back to the hotel. Some people are staring at me because i have a mini hole on my face, but luckily I'm now living in plastic surgery central.

Finally back in the hotel. 

You know what I just noticed is the fact that the manager has not said a single word to me. Maybe he's just in a bad mood. 

Okay.

What the hell.

What the actual HELL.

The itch is back, and its now migrated to my eyebrow.

Well I know exactly how to solve this simple problem.

So i just use my index and middle finger to pinch my eyebrow and use my pocket knife to slice off my eyebrow. To make it feel extra gratifying I sliced it little by little to feel every centimeter of the itch slowly disappear away. 

Good as new and I can proceed to relax!

Well its time for bed.

The manager is already asleep.

Only thing is. I cannot sleep for the life of me.

Why?

I think you know exactly why.

The itch is back and its so much worse.

It has now migrated away from my head and is now disrupting my very manhood.

The very tip of it and I know its only a matter of time before I go insane from this so Caitlyn Jenner 
welcome me to the club!

Back to my handy danndy pocketknife.

Two questions.

Have you ever sliced your own dick off? If you have answered yes to the first question my follow up question is. Why the fuck does it take so damn long?

I swear there is more to the penis than I have ever expected. As Im sawing through bits of tissue and veins I start to finally feel the itch going away slowly. I have been cutting for about 5 minutes and I havent even cut through half of it, but that doesn't matter one bit. It feels amazing. Pure Bliss. Every drop of blood is helping me forget this conference one day at a time.

Well I finally got it off and man does it feel good to be itch free.

I don't know how I'm going to dispose of it. I mean I can flush it down, but I feel like that would just be disrespectful to men all around the world. So I think I'm going to hold on to it. Just as a souvenir or something.

Come to think of it I really did like that coffee I had earlier during the coffee break. I hope no one noticed me grabbing a coffee. It was honestly just to calm myself down after this stressful conference week.

I grab some gauze from the health kit and bandage myself up and finally lay myself down to enjoy some much needed sleep.

So I want to sleep, but I still can't seem to fall asleep. It's just I have this feeling. A feeling that I have something inside of me that needs to leave my body. If it doesn't leave this itch will keep occurring. 

I just need to make an exit point for whatever needs to exit, but I'm really not sure how big I should make it. 

Cut.

Cut.

Itch. 

Scratch. 

Cut.

I don't need to think.

It's getting too hard to anyways.

Cut.

Stomach.

Manager.

Neck.

Cut.

Throat.

Rip out.

Eat.

Adams apples do not in fact taste like apples.

My large 

intestines.

Manager.

Mouth.

Coffee.

Last thought guys.

Whatever is inside of me right now.

They are in every participant that was here.

Some dead.

Some alive.

From every country around the world.

They like to move from body to body.

I need to eat whatever is blocking them from exiting.

They are not visible.

They are there.

Cut manager.

Rip stomach.

Shove face in.

Need.

Find.

Need.

Help.

Leave.

My body.

Not good enough.

Manager's body.

Not good enough.

Need new.

<TEXT> Fourth day of the conference.



There is nothing I wish more than for this conference to end. 



Fourth day of the conference and our attendance has now dropped down to 724 participants.



68 reported deaths so far, and 600 participants that have either gone to a hospital to get themselves checked or have fled the fuck out of dodge.



I wish i wouldn't have to be here, but let me explain something to you. If you either get fired or quit a job in South Korea you are basically fucked. The chances of you finding a job before you run out of your funds and find yourself sharing beans outside of a convenience store with Mr Lee is very fucking low. Mr. Lee does not smell good or have decent manners because he's a salty, homeless, piece of shit that latches on to legs of anyone that passes him by begging for Korean Wine money. So that is why i'm still here.



Shit. I'd rather die than be stuck being Mr. Lee's latch buddy.



So back to this shit storm of a conference.



Everyone is on edge. Participants are now whispering to the people they trust, and the other workers and I have pretty much secluded ourselves to our office.



The only time we leave the office is to prepare for the next part of the conference. When it is time for them to go to another room one of us leaves the office to guide them to the other room and bolt back to the office. Moe, Larry, and Curly have already done their turn so it's my turn to lead them to the coffee break area. 



Stress is overwhelming me so i grab a coffee to settle myself down and fight back the desire to sleep. I see the participants leaving the other room so i guide them to the coffee area. The first thing i notice about them is that they continue scratching various parts of their bodies. 



Fucking gross when most of the participants are now riddled with scabs throughout their bodies. Making it seem like we are now in an elementary class that has been struck by the chicken pox virus. Super, mega, fucking gross when I see some of the participants ripping off their scabs and putting it in their mouths and eating it. Like why the hell are they doing that?



Okay Dr. Fernstein your dick isn't going anywhere. There's no need for all the scratching and grabbing it like a baseball stadium hotdog. I fucking hope he isn't ripping scabs off of his dick and eating it. Like the most bizarre blow job and hand job combined activity ever.



Well I'm about to go back to the office because I've had enough of this shit. 



Why is Moe and the manager coming out?



Damn it.



Before they even come talk to me I run to the office and oh fucking joy!



It looks like a fucked up blood bath love scene.



Larry is now gnawing on his own fingers while Curly is doing the most logical things by using a pair of scissors to cut his ears off and eating them like an entree at red lobsters. (I like entrees from Red Lobsters) 



I'm done just fucking staring so I run up to them and try to get them to stop.



What i get in return is a big hefty bite to my stomach by Curly.



What the hell Curly?



He broke through skin, but (thank God) did not get a bite off of me.



I definitely don't want to look like I got attacked by a midget shark everytime i go to a swimming pool. 



So yeah fuck that I'm not doing shit for them anymore.



Let them eat themselves. 



I use my phone to once again call 119.



Good news.



The police are on their way accompanied by the paramedics.



Bad news.



Larry has already taken out his own eyes and devoured them like they were his last meal. Afterwards, using his pocket knife to rip into his chest area. Curly has noticed this new-found meal and has proceeded to gnaw on his exposed ribs. then tearing out two of his lower ribs and slashing  Larry's midsection and his own midsection. 



Now what creeps me out the second most is the fact that they have both proceeded to tie anything they can with each other. I'm talking intestines (of course, and anything that is connecting their organs to their bodies. What creeps me out the most is that Larry is doing this fucking blind.



Well the cops have finally shown up with the paramedics and they have to send them in with one ambulance. For one blind guy and one deranged guy they have really done a good job with those knots. 



Word spread about what happened. (I came out of the office in hysterics screaming out what just fucking happened) , and that resulted in over 200 participants just turning around and exiting the conference building.



What brings everlasting joy in my heart is that the Local Organizing Committee has made the selfless decision to just finish the conference out. 



I mean who fucking cares that two of our employees just had a buffet of each other?



Me?



I can't fucking quit.



I can't leave either. 



I still need this job.



The job market sucks.



Please give me suggestions on how to deal with this.



One more fucking day.

Just one more fucking day.

<TEXT> For the first two days.
https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5fv6ie/please_help_me/

Well its now the third day of the conference and I have just woken up.

Its 5:30 in the morning so that gives me around 20 minutes to get ready and head out. 

So I just do the regular early morning stuff. Hop in the shower, brush my teeth, dry my hair, and put my suit on. Normal every day stuff. 

The only thing is. Every single time I start doing anything my mind keeps flashing back at the gore I witnessed last night resulting in 3 throw up sessions in between my morning routine. 

I still taste the disgusting bile in my mouth as I rush out of the hotel room.

The manager is already outside waiting on me so I hop in the car and we start driving to the conference site. It was a relatively regular car ride except for the fact that my manager would not stop scratching his hair. I mean how fucking hard is it to just wash your hair? The last thing people want to see in a formal conference setting is someone going ape shit all over their hair and have dandruff mixed into their atmosphere.

Anyways, we finally reached the conference site, and of course its completely empty because the conference doesnt start back up until 9. So we start setting up everything for the day. 

The other workers are running a bit late, but my manager and I manage to get most of it knocked out before they even arrive over an hour late. 

We have 3 other guys working with us. Ill call them Moe, Larry, and Curly for privacy sake. Moe is the guy that has by far the most experience in the conference business out of all five of us. Larry is the guy who has a decent amount of experience but is lazy as hell, and lastly Curly who is just a dumbass.


They come in and they tell us to go take a break since we got most of it done anyways so we, without complaining, go to our little office space to rest. The only thing I couldnt help but notice was that Larry has a pretty long cut alongside his eyebrow. I hope it wasnt a waxing mistake because that would be completely embarrassing. 

So we just lounge around until its time for participants to start spilling into the building. I told my manager to rest some more while I guide them into the first room. Im a nice guy plus the manager has not stopped scratching that dandruff infested hair of his. 

I start bringing in the participants and show them to the room where they will be having a little morning meeting. The speaker that was supposed to lead this meeting was the intestine eater from last night so we quickly replaced him with another speaker. 

The meeting ends well without any hiccups and now its time for their coffee break. Now that everyone has grabbed their coffees I have a second look around, and I realize that we have a lot of people scratching random parts of their bodies really roughly. 

Its far too cold for us to have a mosquito outbreak, and the chance of 80% of our participants having an allergic reaction to the same thing is really unlikely.

Ah fuck it. 

I really dont care how many guys are casually scratching their ball sacks while talking to each other. 

Second meeting. 

Goes without any problems.

Lunch.

Not a problem.

2nd Coffee break?

According to plan.

Third and Fourth Meeting?

Nothing.

So we are now finished and we all go back to the front section of the conference building and wait on the bus.

All participants present?

Check.

Buses are finally here so we start boarding all of our participants in to our buses. Each bus can hold up to 90 people so we only put 75 people in each bus so they can be as comfortable as possible. 

We get everyone loaded up and we are now ready to go back to the hotel. 

I start getting in to the passenger side of the car until I hear screaming coming from the 3rd bus.

Fuck my life. 

So I go up to the 3rd bus to see what all of the commotion is about.

Remember when I told you that the man eating his own intestines and shit was the worst thing I ever saw in my life?

Well this completely blows everything out of the fucking water.

The first thing I notice is the amount of blood that has covered the interior of the bus. 

The next thing I notice is that there are 8 people in the bus still alive, but what they are doing is giving me flashbacks from last night. They are digging in to the bodies of the dead participants and have now proceeded to rip out their large intestines and their small intestines. 

I mean its really nice seeing a group of 8 people working together so well. They have made a pile of all the small intestines and, of course, feasted on the large intestines. The bus driver makes a little gurgling sound and I look at him to see if hes still alive.

Good news.

Hes still alive.

Bad news.

He wont be for long.

His stomach is completely ripped open, and I can see the bite marks all around his intestines. What really bothered me is the fact that all of his fingers and toes have been bitten off and used as plugs for the various organs and intestines that have been left exposed by the chunks they have feasted off of. 

Well thats just fucked up so I cant keep looking, and I turn around to see what the other guys are doing. They have ingested the rest of the large intestines and have started twirling the small intestine around their bodies. 

So.

Fuck that.

I get off the bus and call 119. (Korean Emergency Number)

Then get in the car with my manager and wait for the cops.

The police and ambulance finally arrive, and arrest the intestine covered participants and take the dead participants in the ambulance.

Nothing else to do but go back to the hotel.

We called the Local Organizing Committee when we got back and explained out everything and asking if we can just stop this conference and try again next year. 

They want us to keep going because after all. They paid money, and if the other participants are still okay to keep going they will continue the conference.

The other participants just think it was some satanic ritual performed by 8 fucked up people, and they are all completely willing to continue the conference.

Two more days to go and I have none of my questions answered.

What the fuck is causing all of this.

Why is everyone scratching themselves so much?

Does it have anything to do with the scratching?

I dont know.

Fuck it.

Two more days.

<TEXT> For the 3rd Day
https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5g1y1l/please_help_me_part_2/

Alright guys, 
Im going to need a little bit of help on this one. You can call me Glenn since everyone messes up my name anyways, and I am a run of the mill Korean male. I work in an office, I have a child, a wife, and I am neither great nor bad at what I do. I work for an office that organizes conferences, and after we are organizing said conference we go to that conference and basically make sure everything is run smoothly and efficiently.

So we have finished organizing a conference for aeronautical sciences, and we have now arrived at the conference site which is around 3 hours from our office. So, after the conference we stay at the same hotel most of our participants reside in for the next 5 days. 

The first day of the conference goes by without a hiccup. We have the same bullshit welcome reception where basically old people try to get a bunch of young enthusiasts pumped up for the next week. Then a coffee and tea break where participants make mindless chitchat about the countries they are from and what they do in their amazing new la-di-da fucking job. Then a bunch of lectures and then another coffee break, and then more lectures, then done.
 
Simple.

Seriously, as long as it has been well organized prior to the conference it is a relatively simple week. Minus moving a bunch of stuff and working off of around 5 hours of sleep.

We all get back to the hotel and celebrate by drinking cheap Korean liquor called Soju which is only around a dollar here, and commend each other for a job well done. 

Then sleep.

The rest of the week should go the same way the first day went.
I didnt even notice that there was anything off until lunch the next day.

I mean Im tired and the lack of sleep is already affecting me the second day of the conference, but the first thing I noticed was the absolute lack of conversation. I mean there is well over 1300 people here and the room where lunch is taking place is completely quiet.

I look around the room and I cant help but stare.

Everyone is in perfect sync. They are all chewing at the same exact time. Then raising their fork, and then lowering the fork into the bowl of salad. Putting the salad in their mouth and chewing at the Same. Exact. Time. 

What the actual fuck.

I dont know whats going on but Im absolutely starving so I shove whatever is left on my plate in my mouth and leave.
I go out to where the organizers office is and I see my coworkers steadily tapping away at their computers. Relief floods me because I notice theyre all working at a completely different pace so I know theyre unaffected by whatever the fucks going on.

So I go up to the manager and describe out the scene I just witnessed. 

He thinks its odd but nothing to get completely worried over so I let it slide for now. 

The rest of the day goes by and I have dismissed what happened at lunch as just an odd coincidence.

Back at the hotel now and the manager and I are just relaxing with the TV on. 

My eyes are starting to feel heavy so Im about to fall asleep until I hear a loud scream down the hall on our floor. 

I look at the manager and hes already giving me a weird look signifying he heard the scream too.

So we go outside of our room and what I see next was the worst thing I have ever seen in my life.

One of the speakers for the conference is lying on the hotel floor literally ripping the side of his mouth. His stomach is already ripped open with a pool of intestines spilling out of his open suit. We try to stop him, but every time we get close he kicks us back and proceeds to slowly split the right side of his mouth. Im now just frantically begging him to stop, but he just wont. He has now ripped his mouth to the point to where the rip has reached the bottom of his earlobe and has now started on the other side of his mouth.

Good news. 

The police and paramedics arrived shortly after him starting on the second rip. 

Bad news.

Before they could even stop him he has started to eat the intestines that were protruding out from his stomach, and by the time they did stop him he already chewed through a lot of his large intestines.

After he is carted away by frantic paramedics the manager and I have decided to go back to our room.

So thats what has happened so far. Its only the second day of the conference and we have 3 more days to go. 

So why exactly did he do that?

Is it connected to the lunch scene I witnessed earlier?

Is there anything I can fucking do?

What the fuck is going on?

Help me please.
