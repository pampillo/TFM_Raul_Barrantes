<TEXT> Worse graphics is completely in the eye of the beholder (also a very good game). Don't forget that Blizzard is a HUGE company and Griding Gear Games an Indie studio. 

Also, PoE really starts at around lvl 70-75. When you are playing a game beyond that gameplay matters more over graphics. 

You don't play a game to reach endgame and enjoy it more from there for the graphics, it's all about gameplay. And if it's not, then a ARPG is not a game you should play. Mind you, this is all my personal opinion </TEXT>

<TEXT> People, come on! How can you honestly say D3 is better than PoE. Than you've never played PoE. I've playes both for more than 500 hours and believe me, there is NOTHING D3 beats PoE with. 

Just look at the amount of viewers on Twitch, D3 vs PoE. Grim Dawn is great for what it is. 

Also, PoE is 100% free. The only stuff you can buy is a bigger stash and cosmectic stuff. 

Also, in D3 they have to wait so freaking long to get the Necromancer (and PAY!!!). In the summer PoE is gonna get 6(!!) more acts added to the core game (so that's a total of 10 acts). FOR FREE!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Morning :-)

[This is the build](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1808586/page/1) I was talking about. It has been updated for 2.6 and I'd recommend checking out the other pages for some changes. 

I thought I reacted to your reply but on my phone it wasn't the case.

Hope you like it, I know I did :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> And that build is giving you those stats now? Cause at lvl 60 you should really have maxed out (75% with penalties, except for Chaos res.) resistances, you're going to be in Merciless in a bit. HP should be around 2K by now. 

If you don't mind starting over I know a really nice Blade Flurry build (my favorite skill) </TEXT>

<TEXT> 99% sure. It's the cause of 99% of the crashes since launch. In the new patch notes wrote a fix for it :

*"Fixed a client crash that could previously have been avoided by turning off multithreading. If you disabled multithreading, it can now be enabled again."*

So till that time disable it and you'll be fine :-) Worked for me too </TEXT>

Even after Act IV you don't have a good impression, the real impression starts after all three difficulties. You haven't even scratched the surface, you've just peeked around the corner.

If there ever comes a point that you make it beyond Act X (you probably won't try it again before that) you'll see what I mean... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Max level for a character you mean? That's lvl 100. 

Finding a rare now seems like 'a thing' but at around 70-80 you'll find so much useless rares you don't even pick them up anymore, at least, when using Neversink's lootfilter, that helps a lot.

I really suggest :

Just play PoE and learn, watch a lot of Youtube clips that help you understand the game and idea behind builds, read a lot about what makes PoE PoE and not a 'choose a class and play that class' kind game. A class (like Shadow or Witch) doen'st mean a lot, it only really means where you start on the 'skill board' and  use a lot of 3rd party stuff likle PoE.trade, autohotkey, lootfilters, builds, PoE Ninja etc)

<TEXT> Presuming/hoping you are following a build (if not, it doens't really matter what you do with rares, you are going to botch your build anyway) try to follow the stats on the build-gear on the rares that you find. 

Other than that the rares you don't need for your build can be vendored till lvl 60-70 except for rare jewels, those are mostly worth using or selling on PoE trade. If you want to make sure what each item could be worth before selling them, download PoE trade auto hotkey checker ctrl+D while hovering over an item will tell you the current value based on a couple of things)

Also use Neversink's Lootfilter.

If you say you are low on storage space, do you mean the standard slots? Actually, it doen'st matter. If you are running low at a low level you are hoarding... :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Based on...? Breach has brought in more people than ever. It not my opinion but a statistic fact. 

I like D3 for what it is. It's streamlined and works like a charm but... in the end of the road in just doing Greater Rifts at the highest possible level. That's it. In PoE there is so freakn' much to do, stuff you hope that drops and builds the think of. D3 doesn't come anywhere near the build diversity. I just can't imagine myself going back, even with the Necromancer. 

Like I said, I like D3, for what it is

And the fact that you have two options from the beginning : 

1) Get used to the fact that you are going to start over multiple times because you f*cked up your build OR 2) you NEED to follow a build to the letter to make sure the first statement doesn't happen.

PoE isn't D3. I played D3 a lot and they are two totally different games, to me at least

Regarding selling stuff later on; is checking poe.trade enough the know what something can be sold for? 

I'll check out the max stats, just to know what they are. I saw some rare rings on Reddit that someone found/created and apparantly they were great and worth alot but I could't instantly see what made them so great compared to other. For that I do need to know that max stats I guess </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I just started playing PoE and I'm noticing I'm having a hard time rocognizing when stats on a piece of gear are considered 'good' (or even better for that matter). 

Are there like some standard things to look out for like if a ring had more than 40% res or more than 1-18 added physical damage and so on. 

Thanks all :-) </TEXT>
