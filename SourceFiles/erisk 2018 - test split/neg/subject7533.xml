<TEXT>  Insurers still cannot deny people coverage outright, as was a common practice before the ACA's passage, but they can hike up premiums to an unaffordable amount, effectively pricing people out of the market.

 In fact, premiums could reach as high as $25,700 per year for people in high-risk pools, according to a report from AARP. 

And therein lies one of the problems with pre-existing conditions - at the whims of the insurers </TEXT>

<TEXT>  With the repeal of the ACA many families will lose their only chance at accessing life changing therapy for their autistic children.

 ...the House passed the AHCA, a bill that would allow states to opt out of any mandated coverage for those with pre-existing conditions (pre-existing conditions that include everything from autism to pregnancy).  The bill also would greatly impact Medicaid funding for disabled individuals.  Every medical, disability and autism organization has expressed opposition to the AHCA and what it would mean for our most vulnerable populations.  And yet enough Republicans are okay with that that it passed the House and in doing so they made it perfectly clear to me that I can no longer vote Red in good conscience.  

Pre-existing conditions - the bane of many people's lives. Do we even have a comprehensive list?   </TEXT>

* Energy Secretary Rick Perry, 
* U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley 
* Trumps counselor Kellyanne Conway
* Charmaine Yoest ex-CEO of Americans United for Life, who is assistant secretary of health and human services,
* Teresa Manning - former lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee who is expected to be appointed to oversee the nations family planning program at HHS.

For the first time in a long time, America has an administration thats filled top to bottom with people who stand without apology for life, Pence said.

<TEXT>  Tennessee state Sen. Mark Green (R), President Donald Trumps nominee for Army secretary, strongly believes that citizens should be armed  and not just with any ol guns. They should be able to possess whatever weapons the military has, because an armed citizenry is the ultimate checks and balances against the federal government

 Tennessee state senator also said that the citizenry should be allowed to maintain whatever weapon the federal government has. If they can have an aircraft carrier, I ought to be able to have an aircraft carrier.

Okaaaay...why do I keeping thinking of the "Planet of the Apes"? </TEXT>

 EPA may assess civil administrative penalties of up to $37,500 per day, per violation against federal agencies for noncompliance. The total penalty cannot exceed $295,000 unless EPA and the Department of Justice determine a greater penalty is appropriate. EPA may also issue field citations against federal facilities. A field citation up to $7,500 per day per violation may be assessed in these cases, and are generally issued for minor infractions. (Read more: CAA Stationary Source Civil Penalty Policy, 1991.)

<TEXT>  Last week a Filipino lawyer filed a complaint at the international criminal court (ICC) accusing Duterte and 11 other Philippine officials of mass murder and crimes against humanity.

 In the 77-page complaint Jude Sabio says the president has repeatedly, unchangingly and continuously committed extra-judicial executions or mass murders over three decades, amounting to crimes against humanity.

Wonder how long before this lawyer is suspected of being a drug addict/pusher and is "disappeared" by the vigilante cops. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Close to 9,000 people have died since Duterte took office and promised an unrelenting campaign to rid the Philippines of illegal narcotics. About a third were killed in anti-drug operations in which officers said the victims had violently resisted arrest.

 Many other deaths were blamed on mysterious vigilantes who killed dealers and users, or homicides that could be unrelated to drugs. Police deny any involvement in those killings, most of which they say remain under investigation.

Smart move by jailed critic Senator Leila de Lim. Bring public attention to herself just in case Duterte and his henchmen decide to make her one of the statistics of mysterious vigilantes death. </TEXT>

 The Republican People's Party (CHP) demanded a recount of 60% of votes. They criticised a decision to accept unstamped ballot papers as valid unless proven otherwise.

Of course he had to cheat because left to choose on their own he would have lost.

Unfortunately for him China warned him yesterday about visiting the disputed South China Sea island and he backed down immediately giving some flimsy excuse about friendship:

[Duterte cancels visit to disputed South China Sea island after warning from Beijing
Philippines president backs down on vow to plant flag on Thitu island, citing our friendship with China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/13/duterte-cancels-visit-to-disputed-south-china-sea-island-after-warning-from-beijing)

And now he flip-flops back to the US. Who can believe what Duterte says?

<TEXT>  The story soon caught the attention of Cui Zijian, a boyish-looking propaganda official in Xinjiang who writes about the threat of religious extremism on his Weibo account with nearly 30,000 followers. 

 On December 16, Cui suggested homeowners lobby local officials to block the construction, adding: If that doesn't work, then how about pig head, pig blood. 

A "propaganda official" - it's unfortunate that the story caught the attention of this official who is trained and experienced in spinning a storyline and incite the public against what he viewed as extremism. 

 [Cui]... arguing that his professional and patriotic duty was to resist extremism. His online speech about Muslims was part of the job, he said.

* 60 Cruise missiles rained down on a Syrian military airport where the chemical attack was launched

* Then there is goddam guy on truck mowing down some children in Sweden 

* And now this - bombing near two Coptic churches on Palm Sunday in Egypt with dozens killed and many more injured. 

* And the St. Petersburg subway bombing where 14 died and dozens injured 

It's frigging depressing week...

<TEXT>  In order for him to gain access to the countrys best-kept secrets, the presidents son-in-law was required to report all contacts he had with foreign government officials over the **past seven years.** Kushner, however, omitted dozens of meetings, including ones with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., and Sergey Gorkov, the head of Russias state-owned Vnesheconombank

 Kushners lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, is calling the omissions an error. Gorelick said that Kushner simply submitted the forms prematurely and immediately requested the opportunity to provide additional information.

Is it safe to say that it wasn't ignorance or error on his part. That he knew the procedure and he conveniently omitted them... over 7 years? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Duterte, 72, whose first marriage was annulled and who is in a long-term relationship with another woman, Honeylet Avancena, has openly boasted about having mistresses and using Viagra to have sex with them.

 Who isnt entitled to happiness? Ask these lawmakers, how many of them have two, three or four mistresses? Ask them, Duterte said on Sunday in his first public comments on the Alvarez controversy.

 Dutertes defence of adultery smacks of a double standard, said Elizabeth Angsioco, national chairwoman of the Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines.

 These are men in positions of power so its unacceptable and appalling that they just speak lightly of these things. Its very dangerous, Angsioco added.

This man is the President of the Philippines and was a popular vote in the last general election. He is embolden by his initial popularity (maybe he still is highly regarded by the people) and the shit he says and does is unlikely to be seriously challenged by anyone openly without having a Drug Swat Team outside your front door!   </TEXT>

I dunno - they seem to be making some right decisions thus far: [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Germany)

 Germany's renewable energy sector is among the most innovative and successful worldwide.[citation needed] Net-generation from renewable energy sources in the German electricity sector has increased from 6.3% in 2000 to about 34% in 2016.[1]

 On Sunday 15 May 2016 at 14:00 hours, renewables supplied nearly all of domestic electricity demand.[2] </TEXT>

 "Just because you're a journalist you are not exempted from assassination, if you're a son of a bitch," he said.

 He has also described Jun Pala, a journalist who was murdered in the southern city of Davao in 2003 when Duterte was mayor there, as a "rotten son of a bitch".

 Trump has appointed Scott Pruitt, a climate-change denier, to lead the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), while choosing another denier, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to lead the US Department of Energy. Trump himself has labeled global warming a hoax created by the Chinese to damage the US economy, despite climate change being almost universally acknowledged by scientists.

Under 12333, the NSA taps phone and internet backbones throughout the world, records the phone calls of entire countries, vacuums up traffic from Google and Yahoos data centers overseas, and more.

<TEXT>  Mr Steele also decided to pass on information to both British and American intelligence officials after concluding that such material should not just be in the hands of political opponents of Mr Trump, who had hired his services, but was a matter of national security for both countries.

 However, say security sources, Mr Steele became increasingly frustrated that the FBI was failing to take action on the intelligence from others as well as him. He came to believe there was a cover-up, that a cabal within the Bureau blocked a thorough inquiry into Mr Trump, focusing instead on the investigation into Hillary Clintons emails. 

Its just get curiouser and curiouser - who hired Steele and why didn't British intelligence prompt their US counterpart to take action since its a 'matter of national security for both countries?' </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Mike Pompeo wants to execute Edward Snowden and firmly re-establish mass surveillance as the law of the land in a way that goes even further.

 In an op-ed at the Wall Street Journal in January, Pompeo wrote..., Congress should pass a law re-establishing collection of all metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database.

 Combining of all ones metadata could be even more dangerous than what the government has already done (if its not doing this secretly already). Coordinating individuals metadata into government databases means virtually anything we dowhat we read, where we shop, who our doctor is, who we chat with online, who we call on the phone, who we datebecomes government info.

So he wants everything there is to know about us. WTF is he going to do with all these info?  </TEXT>

 Her disapproval rating rose three percentage points to 93 per cent, according to a poll by Gallup Korea, which is not affiliated with the US-based Gallup, Inc.

93% disapprove of her and she's still hanging on?

 She said: "There is the social perception that if a woman drinks alcohol, she has consented to it.

 "And theres also a racist mentality of thinking, Shes British so she was probably drunk and asking for it.

 "We get people contacting us asking whether they should report a crime and  whether it be a rape or anything else  I often say no," she said. "Absolutely not."

 It was still dark when four men boarded the packed commuter bus heading for Mexico City and ordered the passengers to hand over their valuables. They gathered up mobile phones and wallets, but as they prepared to leave near the town of Toluca, one passenger stood up, drew a pistol and shot the four assailants, killing their leader instantly.

 The three injured robbers stumbled off the bus, but the gunman followed them out and shot them dead at the roadside. Then he returned to the bus, handed back the passengers belongings and disappeared into the darkness.

 ...many Mexicans  fed up with crime, corruption and impunity  took to social media to praise the unidentified killer. None of the bus passengers have offered information to police, saying it was too dark to see him clearly.

<TEXT> Just read this comment from "The Guardian (live)" a couple of mins ago.

 The big picture right now

 Where do things stand, big-picture wise?

 Trumps having a good night. But results in the key battleground state are still out. Pointing to bright points for Trump, we look to Florida, where he is beating previous performances by Republican candidates in many rural counties and in the Tampa and St Petersburg area, which is a lot of people. We look to Virginia, where the race has yet to be called for Clinton, despite strong returns for her in the populous northern counties. And we look to question marks in the upper Midwest, in Wisconsin and Michigan, states that have not gone for a Republican in a presidential election in the last six elections, but where a lot of support for Trump among white, blue-collar voters could tilt the dynamics of the races this year.

 Clinton has bright points to point to as well, including that strong performance in Virginias northern counties, the fact that portions of Florida yet to count are thought to prefer her strongly, and her solid early voting results in Nevada and elsewhere. She has strong precedent to rely on for possible victory in those aforementioned upper Midwestern states, which help make up her so-called blue firewall of states  none of which she has yet lost.

 Its still either candidates race. And were coming up on a new wave of poll closings in states including Nevada, which has a habit of announcing results quickly, and Utah, where the presence of third-party candidate Evan McMullin, and perceived soft support for Trump could be important to the ultimate result.

 We have a ways to go.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I hope the money doesn't go to waste.

There's a lot of people to look after in the winter months ahead:

 The money has been used for grocery store trips every two days that cost about $2,000 each, 20 yurts purchased for $160,000, and around $7,000 for bail money. It has also paid for a storage area, composting toilets, tiny houses, tepees, a medical area and generators powered by solar panels and wind.

 A bookkeeper and an accountant now keep track of the crowd-sourced money.

 I got people to take care of, Brave Bull Allard said. I got to provide homes for people and blankets, thermal wear, socks, hats and gloves, and food. Right now, we are feeding 670 people. </TEXT>

Copy of the article :)

Kendall Jack was dismayed when her health plan stopped covering her migraine drug Treximet earlier this year. To buy a pack at the pharmacy would cost $750, compared with a $20 copay when the drug was covered.
Nothings worth $750 for nine pills, she said. Its cruel.

Instead, the 50-year-old stay-at-home mother from Memphis, Tenn., takes Treximets two active ingredientssumatriptan and naproxenas separate pills. For these two generic drugs, her copay is zero.
A spokesman for Pernix Therapeutics Holdings Inc., which sells Treximet, said the drug addressed an unmet need among migraine sufferers by combining sumatriptan and naproxen into a single tablet. He also said Mrs. Jack could get a pack of Treximet for $20 by contacting the company directly.

Treximet is just one of many drugs whose active ingredients are generic drugs that can be purchased separately at a fraction of the cost. Others include acne cream Acanya, Duexis for rheumatoid pain and weight-loss pill Qsymia, according to data compiled for The Wall Street Journal by GoodRx, a group that compares pharmacy prices for prescription drugs.

A spokesman for Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., which makes Acanya, said doctors could prescribe whichever medication they believe is most appropriate for their patients. Valeant is one drugmaker that has come under fire amid a broader eruption of public anger at drug companies for sharp price increases in recent years.

A spokesman for Horizon Pharma PLC, maker of Duexis, said combining its constituents made it easier for patients to stick with their drug regimen. Mark Oki, chief financial officer of Vivus Inc., which makes Qsymia, declined to comment.

For Treximet, a box of nine tablets costs $728.67, according to Truven Health Analytics. Insurers and employers typically pay less than this so-called list price as a result of behind-the-scenes discounts: the average actual cost for a box of Treximet is about $353, according to an analysis of company-reported sales and prescription data from IMS, a health-care data company. To buy its two constituents, sumatriptan and naproxen, would cost around $19, according to GoodRx.

ENLARGE 

There is no evidence that Treximet tackles migraines any better than a two-pill regimen of sumatriptan plus naproxen. The two clinical trials that led to its approval pitted it against sumatriptan alone, naproxen alone and placebo. Those trials were jointly conducted by GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Pozen Inc., now called Aralez Pharmaceuticals PLC. Glaxo transferred the rights for Treximet to Pernix in 2014.

Some patients avoid paying the full price for Treximet because the cost is partly covered by their health plans. But those whose plans dont cover Treximet face the pharmacy price, which often exceeds the list price.
Pernix and others said they issued coupons to keep patient copays low in some cases. Even so, patients likely will end up paying for it indirectly. Premiums go up, or its passed on to employers, said Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings Solutions, a software company that helps employers and health plans lower their prescription costs by pointing patients to cheaper alternatives. It all comes out of the same bucket.

In some cases, combining two or more drugs into a single pill has benefits, such as added convenience, said Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal. The problem: There is no agreed-upon process for assigning a fair value to those benefits.

This is one more example of the inefficiency of the U.S. health-care system, he said. Mrs. Jack is a case in point: She would be willing to pay a premium price for Treximet, which she finds more effective than two separate pills, but not $750 more.

Whats more, patients and their doctors often have no idea that a cheaper alternative exists. Americans shop [around] for everything in their lives, except medications, said Mr. Rea of Rx Savings Solutions. They dont know how.

Understanding the price of medication with the myriad of health plans offered in the U.S. is extremely complicated, said Anand Rajani, a pediatrician based in Fresno, Calif., who owns a small stake in closely held Rx Savings Solutions. Physicians are totally unaware of the price.
To complicate matters further, some combination drugs use slightly different doses than are easily available to buy separately in the pharmacy. A single pill of Treximet contains 85 milligrams of sumatriptan and 500 milligrams of naproxen. When sold separately, sumatriptan comes in pills of 50 milligrams or 100 milligrams, making direct substitution difficult.
Sharon Orrange, an internal-medicine doctor at Keck Medical Center of the University of Southern California, said she had switched many patients to generics from branded drugs which, like Treximet, comprise two generic constituents. She also works as a consultant for GoodRx on which branded combination drugs can be substituted with cheaper generics.
For many of these patients, the savings are substantial, she said: I have patients who can use the money [saved] to join a gym, or take a trip they couldnt take before. </TEXT>

Kendall Jack was dismayed when her health plan stopped covering her migraine drug Treximet earlier this year. To buy a pack at the pharmacy would cost $750, compared with a $20 copay when the drug was covered.

Nothings worth $750 for nine pills, she said. Its cruel.

Instead, the 50-year-old stay-at-home mother from Memphis, Tenn., takes Treximets two active ingredientssumatriptan and naproxenas separate pills. For these two generic drugs, her copay is zero.

A spokesman for Pernix Therapeutics Holdings Inc., which sells Treximet, said the drug addressed an unmet need among migraine sufferers by combining sumatriptan and naproxen into a single tablet. He also said Mrs. Jack could get a pack of Treximet for $20 by contacting the company directly.

Treximet is just one of many drugs whose active ingredients are generic drugs that can be purchased separately at a fraction of the cost. Others include acne cream Acanya, Duexis for rheumatoid pain and weight-loss pill Qsymia, according to data compiled for The Wall Street Journal by GoodRx, a group that compares pharmacy prices for prescription drugs.

A spokesman for Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., which makes Acanya, said doctors could prescribe whichever medication they believe is most appropriate for their patients. Valeant is one drugmaker that has come under fire amid a broader eruption of public anger at drug companies for sharp price increases in recent years.

A spokesman for Horizon Pharma PLC, maker of Duexis, said combining its constituents made it easier for patients to stick with their drug regimen. Mark Oki, chief financial officer of Vivus Inc., which makes Qsymia, declined to comment.

For Treximet, a box of nine tablets costs $728.67, according to Truven Health Analytics. Insurers and employers typically pay less than this so-called list price as a result of behind-the-scenes discounts: the average actual cost for a box of Treximet is about $353, according to an analysis of company-reported sales and prescription data from IMS, a health-care data company. To buy its two constituents, sumatriptan and naproxen, would cost around $19, according to GoodRx.

<TEXT> [Holland implemented a similar solution in the 90's](https://news.vice.com/article/only-in-the-netherlands-do-addicts-complain-about-free-government-heroin): FTA

 It was in the 1990s when the Netherlands started a program that provides long-term addicts with free government heroin.

 In practice, this means that addicts are allowed to inject or smoke heroin three times a day in a solemn, no frills room in a building run by municipal health services.

 Combined with a specified care program, it has been responsible for almost the complete disappearance of heroin addicts from public view.

*Edit: Added the following -*

[Heroin Assisted Treatment (HAT) program was successful in Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin-assisted_treatment): FTA

 And while it had been speculated that the availability of such treatment options might change public perception of the risks associated with drug use and might lead to an increase in illicit drug use, the incidence of heroin abuse in Switzerland has declined sharply since the introduction of heroin assisted treatment. As a study published in **The Lancet** concluded:

*The harm reduction policy of Switzerland and its emphasis on the medicalisation of the heroin problem seems to have contributed to the image of heroin as unattractive for young people."   Nordt, Carlos, and Rudolf Stohler, "Incidence of Heroin Use in Zurich, Switzerland: A Treatment Case Register Analysis,"[13]

 Also, the notion that patients in heroin assisted treatment are enabled to maintain "destructive behavior" contradicts the findings that patients significantly recover in terms of both their social and health situation. A clinical follow-up report on the German "Heroin studie" found that 40% of all patients and 68% of those able to work had found employment after four years of treatment. Some even started a family, after years of homelessness and delinquency.[14] </TEXT>

 The book in question is *The Total Rush*  or, to use its superior English title, *Blitzed*  which reveals the astonishing and hitherto largely untold story of the Third Reichs relationship with drugs, including cocaine, heroin, morphine and, above all, methamphetamines (aka crystal meth), and of their effect not only on Hitlers final days  the Fhrer, by Ohlers account, was an absolute junkie with ruined veins by the time he retreated to the last of his bunkers  but on the Wehrmachts successful invasion of France in 1940. </TEXT>

 The precise details of Mrs Bibi's case are unclear. Reports say the woman, who lives with her family in the village of Ittanwali, west of Lahore, had been working in the fields in June last year when she was sent to fetch water. When she returned, some Muslim women refused to drink it, saying it was unclean because it had been carried by a Christian. The women then fought.

 At that point the other women went to a local cleric, Qari Salim, and several days later he filed a legal complaint with the police. When the case was eventually concluded last week, in addition to being sentenced to death, Mrs Bibi was also ordered to pay a fine of 300,000 Pakistani rupees (2,180).

 Last night, Mrs Bibi's husband told The Independent: "My wife was picking phalsa in the fields when she had a fight with her other workers over some triviality. The other three got together and accused my wife of desecrating the Holy Koran It was not even a men's fight in the village, but a trivial tussle between women."

All because of a bowl of drinking water...  </TEXT>

I think it's unacceptable to host a WOMEN'S World Championship in a place where women do not have basic fundamental rights and are treated as second-class citizens. For those saying that I don't know anything about Iran: I have received the most support and gratitude from the people of Iran, who are facing this situation every day.

 The Iraqi national was a former spokesman for the controversial organisation Called to Islam (Kaldet til Islam) which is said to advocate the introduction of Sharia Law in Denmark, according to Hate Speech International.   

 It was also revealed in court that he had been previously sentenced for threatening to decapitate the chairman of the Danish Syrian Association over his support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against Isis.

 The term encounter is a widely understood euphemism for extra-judicial killings in Pakistan. Police accounts often say that criminal or terrorist suspects were shot after they resisted arrest or tried to ambush officers.....

 As far as they are concerned encounters are the perfect way of getting rid of hardened criminals, he said. They do not consider it a gross violation of human rights and instead see it as an effective way of delivering justice.

 Among Federal Court Justice Robin Camp's remarks during a 2014 sexual assault trial, according to a notice of allegations posted on the Canadian Judicial Council website:

 "Why couldn't you just keep your knees together? Why didn't you just sink your bottom down into the basin so he couldn't penetrate you?"

 Young women, the judge said, "want to have sex, particularly if they're drunk," according to the notice.

 He also said that "some sex and pain sometimes go together" and "that's not necessarily a bad thing."

 Camp's controversial remarks resulted in an investigation by the Canadian Judicial Council, a federal body that polices judges.

Gee... he could have just stopped after making the first couple of comments.

 He find us in a place like this [park] and he invite us to a bar and he let us drink beer and then he take us to his home and there he give us beer, he said. 

 We start drinking and then he start touching us on our body. After we leave the house, he calls us and he gives us money.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/10/24/if-iceland-can-jail-bankers-for-the-crash-then-why-cant-america/#6d1e37c94a67

That's a 2015 article about Ireland's part so the *headline might be misleading* since the US might have also prosecuted a few banker for their part in the 2008 banking crisis. 

FTA - an interesting point the author made:

 The truth is that those bankers jailed in Iceland did things that would get them jailed in the US too. And the bankers in the US did not do things that would have got them jailed in Iceland.

 There is, you see, a difference in doing something criminal to make money and simply getting things wrong in the pursuit of making money. Sure, theres criminals in every part of every system but the problems of the Great Crash in the US were brought about not by bankers being criminal but by bankers being wrong. And thankfully, otherwise wed all be in jail for we all make mistakes, being wrong isnt a criminal offence. </TEXT>

 Venezuela has become a failed state.

 According to the International Monetary Fund's latest projections, it has the world's worst economic growth, worst inflation and ninth-worst unemployment rate right now. It also has the second-worst murder rate, and an infant mortality rate at public hospitals that's gotten 100 times worse itself the past four years. And in case all that wasn't bad enough, its currency, going by black market rates, has lost 99 percent of its value since the start of 2012. It's what you call a complete social and economic collapse. And it has happened despite the fact that Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves.

 Never has a country that should have been so rich been so poor. </TEXT>

 One of the men suspected of killing a priest at a church in northern France was being monitored by police and was wearing a surveillance tag at the time of the attack, officials say. Prosecutor Francois Molins said Adel Kermiche, 19, was twice arrested last year trying to reach Syria.

What's the purpose of the surveillance tag? What does the police do with data collected from this monitoring system? I have no idea so perhaps someone can weigh in on this?  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  An American Airlines spokeswoman said in a statement: American [Airlines] was contacted by CAIR earlier this year. We thoroughly reviewed these allegations and concluded that no discrimination occurred. We serve customers of all backgrounds and faiths and do not tolerate discrimination of any kind.

That's it? "Case" closed? What a lot of crock from AA trying hard to sweep this under the carpet.

 Mohamed Ahmed Radwan had boarded a plane in Charlotte, North Carolina and the flight attendant went to the tannoy and said: Mohamed Ahmed, Seat 25-A: I will be watching you.  The employee made no other announcements about any other passenger.

There was discrimination and the passenger was singled out for special treatment

 The passenger then reported the incident to two other American Airlines employees. He was told he must leave the plane as he had made the first air stewardess uncomfortable.

He made her uncomfortable so he has to leave the plane? That's all the justification AA needs to escort someone off the plane?

I guess ultimately his words against them and AA concluded there was nothing to it.. no apology, no reprimand, nothing. Swell!

Edit: 

The complaint filed by CAIR said that the [flight attendant made the announcement 3 times] (http://www.cair.com/images/pdf/CAIR_Letter_to_DOT_re_American_Airlines.pdf).  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  According to the complaint, federal investigators posed as an advertiser, buying an ad on KAT in March 2016 for $300 a day. He was given information for a Latvian bank for making his payment, but was told not to mention KAT anywhere. When he went to buy a second ad, he was told that only pricier ads were available for $1,000 to $3,200 a day. He kept buying more ads and by May, received details about a different bank in Estonia. Through this investigation, the authorities learned which bank account KickassTorrents was using and obtained records, including hosting records that showed KAT was hosted in Chicago for a little over three years.

<TEXT>  Another senior official has directly blamed the United States.

 The Obama administration has strongly denied any involvement or responsibility in recent events in the country. In a phone call to his counterpart in Turkey, US Secretary of State John Kerry said: Public insinuations or claims about any role by the United States in the failed coup attempt are utterly false and harmful to our bilateral relations."

None of these allegations by Erodogan's govt has any basis other than his so-called political "enemy" residing in the US. 

Erdogan is either playing a well thought out strategic game or he is simply lashing out in anger. From threatening the German parliament over the recent recognising the Armenian genocide to now insinuating that the Obama administration is directly involved in the recent attempted coup, he is rapidly losing allies. Erdogan is either a raving lunatic or simply a brilliant strategist.

But it's hard to credit him as the latter seeing that he reckons Mulism woman should have three children and alienated himself from those women voters. That hardly seems like a clever move for a politician. 

How critical is Incirlik Airbase to US and NATO operations or are there alternatives for USAF in neighbouring countries? It's risky to station US forces in a country and then to have to rely on a whims and fancies of a nutjob who can turn on sixpence.

<TEXT>  Gergely, an altar boy, would get pulled out of class and told to go to the church to help the monsignor.

 That was Father Francis McCaa, who was called a monster by a state grand jury in March. Its report concluded that he was among at least 50 priests in the local Altoona-Johnstown diocese who had systematically raped and molested hundreds of boys and girls for 40 years, while bishops covered it up and the criminal justice system looked the other way. McCaa died in 2007, at 82.

 Gergely killed himself earlier this month at 46.

50 frigging priests in the diocese were pedophiles! And the bishops covered for them.

So is it safe to say that in such a scenario Airbnb has invariably caused an rental increase in apartments in that area?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a surprise really. Cameron left them in the lurch after "remain" lost. 

The next PM (assuming no general election) and hence the leader of the Tory will need to action Article 50 and detach themselves from the EU in two years. It's an onerous task for any PM. 

Many people, business and tons of those people in UK will hate you if Brexit causes them hardship. 

Many will feel the short term pain of dealing with a weaker pound and increase in imported goods. There is the spectre of inflationary rise that will filter it's way though the economy into everyday expenses. And they will hate whoever is the PM that let it happen and even more so one who voted for "leave" and has no plan for a tactical withdrawal.

<TEXT> OP is probably referring to [this](http://www.newsweek.com/marijuana-and-old-amsterdam-308218)

 Cannabis with more than 15 percent of the THC that makes it intoxicating is now under consideration to be reclassified as one of the hard drugs that come with stiff penalties. The government has also forced coffee shops where marijuana is sold to choose between alcohol and pot, prompting many to choose the former. Amsterdam once played host to nearly 300 coffee shops, of more than 1,000 scattered across the country. There are now fewer than 200 in the city and only 617 nationwide. While its always been illegal to grow marijuana in the Netherlands, authorities passively allow coffee shops to sell weed, often pretending not to know where the shops cannabis comes from.

 But no longer. New laws target even the smallest of marijuana growers in Holland. In the past, people could grow up to five plants without fear of retribution. In 2011, the government issued new police guidelines and declared anyone who grew with electric lights, prepared soil, selected seeds or ventilation would be considered professional. Its a significant change, as professional growers risk major penalties, including eviction and blacklisting from the government-provided housing in which more than half of the countrys citizens reside. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Cannabis Licensing Authority (CLA) chairman Hyacinth Lightbourne said the proposed dispensers would be essential in the therapeutic use of the drug.

 It would primarily be for people who have a prescription and, in effect, you're doing it for medicinal purposes with a permit from the Ministry of Health. If they don't have a prescription, then they can do what we call 'self-declare', and this will allow them to have the two ounces while they are here, Mr Lightbourne said.

In other words, you will have your two ounces during your stay here in Jamaica ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Another interesting controversy in the De Anza case concerning Judge Persky:

 Four of the baseball players invoked fifth amendment rights not to self-incriminate during the discovery phase of the litigation.......

 The original judge in the case ruled in 2010 that the defendants could stay silent, but that would also mean that they would be prohibited from testifying in a later part of the case. 

 That ruling was, however, overturned by Persky, a move that Jane Does attorneys now say undermined her case.

 Persky, taking over the trail in 2011, allowed one of the defendants, Christopher Knopf, to enter evidence that the womans lawyers believed should have been covered by the earlier judges order.

 It was shocking to see judge Persky disregard that order, Burneikis said. One judge completely disregarding an order that another judge has entered: yes, that was unusual.

 It was devastating, she continued. I can remember how I felt the moment the ruling came down and it was like a nail in a coffin. I could not comprehend it.

<TEXT> Not trying to discredit you. 

I am not an authority on such matters so I have to resort to a Google search and this WHO report is interesting especially this part: 

 The organ-exporting countries

 India was a commonly known organ-exporting country, where organs from local donors are regularly transplanted to foreigners through sale and purchase. Although the number of foreign recipients seems to have decreased after the enactment of a law banning the organ trade (the Human Organ Transplantation Act of 1994),10 the underground organ market is still existent and resurging in India. The Voluntary Health Association of India estimates that about 2000 Indians sell a kidney every year.11 The drop in foreign recipients in India was accompanied by an increase in the number of foreign recipients in other countries, such as Pakistan and the Philippines.

 In Pakistan, according to the Sindhi Institute of Urology, approximately 2000 renal transplants were performed in 2005, of which up to two-thirds were estimated to have been performed on foreigners.12 In the Philippines, data obtained from the Renal Disease Control Program of the Department of Health, National Kidney Transplant Institute, show that of the 468 kidney transplants in 2003, 110 were for patients from abroad. There is no comparable data for Egypt but a considerable number of patients from neighbouring countries are believed to undergo organ transplantation there.13

 In China, around 12 000 kidney and liver transplants were performed in 2005. Most of the transplant organs were alleged to have been procured from executed prisoners, a practice which itself is criticized by the international community.14,15 In the absence of paid organ donors, a question may be raised regarding whether the deceased organ transplants in China constitute an organ trade. Yet the lack of established rules about the allocation of organs, coupled with the prioritizing of foreigners due to their ability to pay and the existence of brokers, have been widely reported. These factors have led to the view that deceased organ transplants for foreigners in China do constitute part of the international organ trade. The number of foreign recipients in China is difficult to estimate, but a media report offers circumstantial evidence that over half of the 900 kidney and liver transplants performed in one major transplant centre in 2004 were for non-Chinese citizens from 19 countries.16

 The lack or insufficiency of a legal framework or enforcing mechanism in these countries has been highlighted by the public media and local experts. However, the Chinese and Pakistani governments recently have been taking steps to curtail the international organ trade (as of May 2007), which may change their respective situations.17,18

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/amazon-tribe-makes-first-contact-with-outside-world

In Peruvian rainforest: 

The contact took place across the border in Brazil and was recorded in a video released on Friday. The tribesmen caught a serious respiratory disease after contact, a major killer of isolated indigenous people, but have since recovered.


Also in Brazil: 

 The tribesmen come from one of over 75 uncontacted tribes believed to inhabit the vast Amazon rainforest, and their group is estimated to now number 40-50 people. They returned to the village some time after their first visit, suffering from a flu-like disease.

 A specialist medical team from the Brazilian governments indigenous peoples authority (Funai) treated the men, who have since returned to the forest.

 The doctor who treated the tribesmen warned of the possibility of more contacts in the region and emphasised the crucial need to train more specialised health teams to deal with first-contact and post-contact situations. Common diseases such as flu can cause fast and deadly epidemics in isolated tribes which have never encountered such infections before. .... 

We should leave them alone as much as possible.

 ["Deng Xiaoping entered the arena. He may not have held an official job title, but everyone in the world knew Deng ruled the Chinese roost. Abrasive, direct, chain-smoking and spitting into a porcelain spittoon, his two-hour meeting with Thatcher was testy, to say the least. There has been a lively debate, one British official was later reported as saying, about whether Dengs habit of spitting while receiving visitors is done for effect, or whether he really is a vulgar old bugger. ](http://www.timeout.com.hk/big-smog/features/41918/hong-kong-history-margaret-thatcher-1982.html)

Can't be much fun looking over your shoulder or thinking if  someone is lurking in shadows following that unfortunate incident in the hallway. It's understandable that you have a heightened sense of fear and foreboding whoever someone seem to be following you - hence your emotional response is more acute than most of us.

<TEXT> I may be wrong since I am no expert or even remotely close to the field of psychology/neurology etc. From the highest OP's comment I think this amygdala hijack is almost instantaneous - the amygdala takes over in milliseconds and the rational part of the brain has no chance to even "think about it". From thence on if the experience has been mapped the emotional side of the brain is triggered and the noecortex is not prominently active. 

I guess in your case it's a collection of bad experiences that allowed you to form some opinion of the unfairness of the professors' actions and the basis for your judgement of them. I don't think this is rage - which is almost instantaneous - like this guy [here](
http://i.imgur.com/bHeXIB5.gifv) - from r/wtf

That doesn't mean your are not being unfairly treated. 

But as I said I am no expert and I bow to those with superior knowledge ;)

<TEXT> I am no expert but I read somewhere that it helps if you take a few deep breaths - slowly and gently (not hyperventilate) to contain your initial impulse to overreact.  This might give you time to figure if your next action is going to be counterproductive and calm the fuck down! Maybe even excuse myself and leave the room if possible. Avoid making it worse for yourself - it's your emotional side taking control.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very Interesting - thanks. Personally witness such a reaction last week at a meeting. 

 An amygdala hijack exhibits three signs: strong emotional reaction, sudden onset, and post-episode realization if the reaction was inappropriate.

What if a person is still angry post-episode and still think their rage reaction is justified when everyone think they overreacted? Is there some psychological explanation or term for such persons? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Forgot about that. Just got this excerpt from Wikipedia where he was shot during a drug bust:

 Shooting and public interest

 Serpico was shot during a drug arrest attempt on February 3, 1971, at 778 Driggs Avenue, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Four officers from Brooklyn North received a tip that a drug deal was about to take place. Two policemen, Gary Roteman and Arthur Cesare, stayed outside, while the third, Paul Halley, stood in front of the apartment building. Serpico climbed up the fire escape, entered by the fire escape door, went downstairs, listened for the password, then followed two suspects outside.[7]

 The police arrested the young suspects, and found one had two bags of heroin. Halley stayed with the suspects, and Roteman told Serpico (who spoke Spanish), to make a fake purchase attempt to get the drug dealers to open the door. The police went to the third-floor landing. Serpico knocked on the door, keeping his hand on his revolver. The door opened a few inches, just far enough to wedge his body in. Serpico called for help, but his fellow officers ignored him.[7]

 Serpico was then shot in the face with a .22 LR pistol. The bullet struck just below the eye and lodged at the top of his jaw. He fired back,[8] fell to the floor, and began to bleed profusely. His police colleagues refused to make a "10-13" dispatch to police headquarters indicating that an officer had been shot. An elderly man who lived in the next apartment called the emergency services and reported that a man had been shot. The stranger stayed with Serpico.[7] A police car arrived. Unaware that Serpico was one of them, the officers took him to Greenpoint Hospital.[citation needed]

Good film too starring Al Pacino.  </TEXT>

Given the situation recently in Yemen where a Saudi-led Arab coalition were pressing for a bombing campaign in Yemen to restore the ousted govt. and that Saudi Arabia recently deter UN investigation in alleged human rights violation in Yemen, I doubt this US bombing incident is going to gain much traction especially as a "war crime" investigation.

There were these two so-called [Opium wars in China involving the British](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars)

 The Chinese briefly sought to stop Britain from illegally importing and selling opium in the country, while Britain sought to legalize its opium trade and to liberalize other trade. For Britain, its balance of trade would be more favourable if Chinese payments for smuggled opium, provided from India and Turkey by British and other merchants, were boosted. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  African wildlife expert Dex Kotze says it is impossible that Palmer's hunting team didn't know it was Cecil.

 "I mean a black mane lion like that you can see from afar and even on a hunt. You are definitely going to identify that this -- hang on this is a collared lion and it is Cecil. Because all the conservationists and wildlife industry in that area would have been very familiar with that lion Cecil," Kotze told CBS News' Debora Patta.

<TEXT> Perhaps that was more an opportunity than a plan when Pao was hired. 

Yishan left recommending Pao allowing him a smooth exit that's nice and clean on friendly grounds ( don't burnt bridges if you still wish to remain in business). His intention was no honourable.

Pao did the job but her court case made her lose focus. Couple Thant with her incompetence or lack of understanding of the community culture resulted in some bad moves. Those confluence of forces presented an opportunity for Alexis to capitalise on a vague idea to monetise Iama but there a stumbling block was Victoria. He needed to remove her but needed a cover to deflect the heat and the opportunity presented itself in the shape of Pao. The situation was ripe for plucking! 
 
She wasn't the "glass cliff" originally planned to take the blame (you are giving Alexis to much credit for planning) but she become one as the situation unfurled.

I could be wrong !

<TEXT> Some corporate-speak (lame excuses) along the lines like - we were for free speech when we were a fledgling startup and focusing on a very raw reddit. Now with changing time we have investors breathing down our neck demanding some solid evidence of ROI. And of course with authoritities such as the NSA with their bastion of eavesdropping tools and the need to comply with legal requirements, we feel reddit cannot continue to support absolute free speech as we know it. It put us in an awkward position that might force us to cross the line into illegal territories such pics of dead kids for instance. 

We regret this decision but feel it's the best for the majority concern. As a business we need to be profitable at some point and adv will not use reddit or be associated with it if we are unable to control the subreddits in existence.

Oh btw we hope to hive reddit off to some big dumb company for $$$ billions in a year's time and we can't do that without first doing some spring cleaning! Each of us hope to walk away with $$$millions in our bank account soon. 

Please feel free to edit to suit the occasion.

<TEXT> Confirmed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_and_Golden_Eagle_Protection_Act

 Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668d) is a United States federal statute that protects two species of eagle. The bald eagle was chosen as a national emblem of the United States by the Continental Congress of 1782 and was given legal protection by the Bald Eagle Protection Act of 1940. This act was expanded to include the golden eagle in 1962.[1] Since the original Act, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act has been amended several times. It currently prohibits anyone, without a permit issued by the Secretary of the Interior, from "taking" bald eagles. Taking is described to include their parts, nests, or eggs, molesting or disturbing the birds....

Penalties:

The criminal penalty stipulation.. maximum fine of $5,000 and one year's imprisonment. Furthermore, in the second case of second conviction, the penalty was increased to $10,000 fine and two years imprisonment. The maximum amount of a misdemeanor offense was increased $100,000 under the Criminal Fines and Improvement Act of 1987. In addition, $250,000 will be fined for an individual for a felony conviction. Respectively, $200,000 and $500,000 will be fined in case of an organization for a misdemeanor and felony conviction.[2]

 The civil penalty provision was added, stating anyone who takes, possess, transports, sells, barters, or purchases any dead or alive bald or golden eagles will be fined $5,000 for each violation. In addition, he or she who violates or disturbs any egg or nest will be fined under the civil penalty act. The act allowed the taking, possession, or transporting of the bald and golden eagles in areas where they were endangering wildlife and livestock.[2]

Native American - The Federal Eagle Aviary and Eagle Aviary Permit

 This permit allows Native American tribes to possess lawfully obtained live bald or golden eagles for religious activities. In order to be eligible for this permit, tribal entities must be registered and be receiving services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Federal Eagle Aviary is a facility that houses non-releasable bald and golden eagles for the religious purposes of Native Americans. The permit's intent is to provide Native Americans with an additional source of feathers through moulting...[35] </TEXT>

 "After Garner expressed to the police that he was tired of being harassed and that he was not selling cigarettes, officers moved to arrest Garner on suspicion of selling "loosies" (single cigarettes) from packs without tax stamps.[15] When officer Daniel Pantaleo took Garner's wrist behind his back, Garner swatted his arms away.[16] Pantaleo then put his arm around Garner's neck and pulled him backwards and down onto the ground.[17] After Pantaleo removed his arm from Garner's neck, he pushed Garner's face into the ground[18][19] while four officers moved to restrain Garner, who repeated "I can't breathe" eleven times while lying facedown on the sidewalk.[7][20][21] After Garner lost consciousness, officers turned him onto his side to ease his breathing. Garner remained lying on the sidewalk for seven minutes while the officers waited for an ambulance to arrive.[22] The officers and EMTs did not perform CPR on Garner at the scene; according to a spokesman for the PBA, this was because they believed that Garner was breathing and that it would be improper to perform CPR on someone who was still breathing.[23][24] He was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital approximately one hour later.[25][26]" </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a legislation to help break the "glass ceiling" effect. No-one is saying it is going to be easy to enforce but such a legislation is workable, for instance: 

 In 2008, Norway became the first country to enact a quota of 40 percent, threatening to dissolve publicly traded companies who did not comply. France, Iceland and Spain soon followed. The Netherlands and Malaysia set non-binding targets of 30 percent. Australia, Britain and Sweden have threatened to enforce quotas if companies not voluntarily give more corporate supervisory seats to women

<TEXT> The author wasn't trying to discuss the technicality of the patented ideas but merely pointing out how Apple lost this case - by being complacent and flexing its muscle instead of doing some preparation and showing some respect to the court and jurors. 

 Brad Caldwell, the Dallas-based patent infringement specialist who represented Smartflash...tells a curious story.

 I think the reason we won, he says, is because we focused on the questions that were going to be presented to the jury: Were the patents valid? Did Apple infringe? Was the infringement willful?

 Apple, according to Caldwell, focused on everything but the issue at hand..

 They thumbed their nose at other people, says Caldwell. They acted like were Apple and have no need to respect other peoples intellectual property.

Much as I dislike patent-troll, Apple deserved to lose this case. Apple's key witness didn't even bother to read the patent:

 Augustin Farrugia, Apples director of security and its key witness, had previously designed the national banking system for Singapore. On the stand he said he too hadnt gotten around to reading Racz patents.

<TEXT>  And it is a given that people will break ethical boundaries to fulfil moral obligations. The only thing we disagree on is what is immoral. Selfish people think it is immoral for them personally to lose. Generous people think it is immoral for others to lose. They will both break ethical boundaries to achieve a desired outcome.

Interesting explanation. Not knocking you but is there some research citations about the relationship between ethics and moral obligations.

 These kinds of discussions are better handled in /r/politics[1] where knee jerk accusations and confrontational tone at least make for good entertainment.

"[The rescue team] went in to rescue him and [his captors] had bound him up so tightly that he was in a lot of pain," she said. "The vet and our team came with fruits and just started speaking softly to him and to reassure him that we were there to help, and it was at that time that tears flooded down his face. The founder of Wildlife SOS, who was there are the time of the rescue, said .... that really caught him off guard. They've done a lot of elephant rescues and the fact the the tears were just coming down ... he was weeping. It was an emotional moment and everyone was more motivated to get him on the truck and to safety."
