<TITLE> Travel Cover for TaylorMade Catalina Cart Bag </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 16:33:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi folks,

I'm traveling home to Ireland this summer for a month, and I want to bring my clubs. I have the TaylorMade Catalina Cart Bag, and I'm wondering if any of you fine folks know where I could get a cover/casing for it.

I've seen the horror stories of bags being dragged along the ground at airports and I want to ensure my bag is in an outer plastic shell/casing.

Any ideas where I could find one that fits my bag?

This is her (although mine is in white   black): http://taylormadegolf.com/Catalina-Cart-Bag/DW-SQ821.html

Looks like this might do the job - TaylorMade confirmed it too.

<TEXT> Yeah, this is how it is for me as well. 

It depends on how tired I am and what mood I'm in, if there's any distractions around me as well. If I'm reading while someone is watching a TV beside me it can be hard and I'll definitely read at a slower pace. I don't read that quickly anyway to begin with. For example it took me over seven hours of continual reading (according to my kindle stats) to finish Roger's Version by John Updike. I know people that have finished it in 4 or less.

I like to take things in though, and take it slow. If I fly through a book (which I have done in the past), I'll find that a few months down the road I can't remember a whole lot of the book so what was the point? But the flip side of that is reading a book again a few years later is like a new experience.

I'm rambling, apologies.  </TEXT>

The Druze are a tightly-knit religious sect whose origins can be traced to Egypt a thousand years ago. They believe that God was incarnated on earth in the form of their leader, al-Hakim bi-Amrih Alla. The Druze do not have their own homeland. Thus, many of them migrated to the isolated mountains of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, while others settled throughout the Middle East. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a moderately good response to the writing proposal.

We're all extremely busy living our lives so I'd rather give folks a month to come up with something, as opposed to two weeks. After running the book club here, it's obvious that a lot of us just don't have the time so I don't want to push deadlines on people.

Submit your topics for the first month here. I'll close the thread on May 1st when we can begin writing. I'm OK with people writing about anything they like as long as it's not sports related (where did I get that from eh?). I'm also OK with folks writing about different topics if they wish to do so.

I'll submit a couple of topic ideas:  
1. Why pining for Christopher Hitchens is not what he would have wanted.  
2. I survived the first 100 days of Trump.  
3. The Pope's involvement in the murder of approximately 1 million innocent women as "witches". </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on your perspective really. 

RTE are using oauth 1, which was designed to go over http. It's out dated, they should be using oauth 1a or oauth 2.

They're not a bank, you're only going to gain access to so much by exploiting someone's RTE Player account. 

The scope of this is irrelevant though. At the end of the day they're using a vulnerable authentication method over http. End of, really. </TEXT>

If this particular request was encrypted, and went over SSL, then I wouldn't be able to sit on a public network and sniff this information. By this information I mean the oauth login tokens which are sent over http.

You're confusing both of those items. Customer personal information vs oauth information.

<TEXT> I still don't see what you're achieving with the exploit.

"Compromising someone's RTE player account" barely makes sense, since it only contains their email address, DOB and county (if they choose to provide it). All information that could ge gleaned from most people's online presence without any effort.

This attack can be used to take control of someone's RTE Player account. You can log in as them. That's not a huge deal, given that everyone *should* have a TV license. Now considering you can log in as them, you can use it to take control over the account. 

The information contained in their account is irrelevant really. I don't really care about the information you can see when you take over someone's account. The issue is being able to take over their account to begin with.

Sorry, but who said it's an amazing vulnerability?

You wouldn't even need to be on the same network as the person to get this data from somebody.

You're ignoring how this can be used to compromise someone's RTE Player account completely, and focusing on the social media aspect.

<TEXT> Yeah - apologies.

In layman terms, you can create an account on RTE Player using Facebook/Google+. When you do this, you give the RTE application permission to use your Facebook/Google+ account. It does this via an oauth token. Currently the RTE app has permission to view your private email account associated with Facebook/Google+.

If I was on the same wireless network as you (or wired network), and you were using the RTE Player Application on your phone, I would be able to compromise your RTE Player account completely using this vulnerability. 

I would also be able to use the oath token to get your email account associated with Facebook/Google+, even if you have selected to have it available "only to me". 

I could then use this info to attempt a phishing attack, and if someone did fall for it and click the link in the mail then I'd be able to completely compromise their Facebook/Google+ account. 

Not everyone falls for phishing attempts obviously, but a large number of people still do.

So the social media aspect of this isn't huge or earth shattering, but you can completely compromise someone's RTE Player account. Most people have a TV license so that's not a huge deal either I suppose. But not all of us live in Ireland anymore. :)

<TEXT> Have any of you looked into the windows 10 data collection that Microsoft performs?  

Even though I have opted out of data collection and the user experience stuff, using fiddler I see regular json HTTP POST calls to microsoft.com and bing.com with a list of running processes, and list of installed applications, and some other information.

It appears to be the "searchui" process that's doing this.

One of the URLs it sends the HTTP POST request to is https://www.bing.com/threshold/xls.aspx

Lots of metadata being sent, stuff like:

<TEXT> I prioritize reading over watching TV, over dicking around online, over social interactions (some times).  

I haven't read as much as I would like the past couple of months, because I just bought a house so I have been really slacking as I've only read 13 books so far this year, I'm already 11 behind schedule. Life happens though, so whatever.

Now that things are settling down again I'll get back into it. I love watching QI, so some times that will get priority over reading for a while. No harm in that either, QI is amazing and if you're unfamiliar with it you're the worse for it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Another Walden thread </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've never read Walden before, despite it being on my "to read" list on Goodreads for years. I was strolling downtown with my wife yesterday afternoon after a late lunch/early dinner and we stopped by a bookstore and the book practically jumped into my hands. I love it when this happens.

I stopped the book I'm currently reading by John Updike - Roger's Version - in favour of Walden. I'll go back to Updike's novel afterwards.

I read 55 pages of it yesterday. The first 30 pages or so, were a bit of a slog honestly. It's an interesting style of writing, but it appears to be pretty smooth sailing from 31 - 55. I'm loving the discussion around house ownership, given that I just bought a house a month ago.  

Any fans of Walden here? Looks like I'm in for a real treat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Would any of you be interested in an essay writing competition?

To follow in Hitchens' footsteps, all topics except for sport(s) would be permitted. Something like a 1,000 word minimum with no maximum limit.

I understand we're all busy, I just bought a house and I'm in the middle of moving, but I was thinking we could have a month to produce *something*.

It would not matter if the essays were terrible. The point of the exercise is to get the creativity flowing and to get one thinking critically. 

It doesn't even have to be a competition. We could create an area in the sub for members that wish to have their thoughts heard and criticized. A place to foster discussion. 

Any thoughts on this?

<TEXT> Facts are facts, and sooner or later we are compelled to deal with them. Theories may ignore them, but the consequences follow just the same. It is not merely our duty to face the facts, it is to our interest to do so. All life is an adaptation of organism to environment, and all healthy mental life is the expression of a harmony between our ideas of facts and the facts themselves. And without posing as a philosophical Gradgrind, one may confidently assert that the man or the philosophy that ignores facts will sooner or later come to grief.

<TEXT> Lots of practice, and lessons. When I started again a couple of years back I couldn't hit the ball 20 feet. It would run along in front of me. I felt so awkward and out of place. But I kept going to the range to try to find my old swing. It took months of persistence, and fun to be honest. I loved the challenge. 

When I felt in a position to join a club, I joined one with a great PGA Pro Swing Coach - one of the top 40 in the USA. I had a few lessons with him, and he was able to see some things I was doing wrong instantly - stuff that would have taken me years to figure out myself honestly.

I injured myself in Oct/Nov, went back out there in February and I was swinging poorly. I went and had a lesson and he saw that I was favouring side I had injured, when swinging. 

I made a tiny adjustment and I was hitting them brilliantly again.

I just haven't been out lately because we bought a house (moved in last week, boxes are all around me as I type this), and I've been dealing with all of that since early March. 

The issue I have now, is that I'm over an hour from my course, and my swing coach. Going to have to find another course closer to me. The house is worth it though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not too old. I played as a teenager, didn't play again until a couple of years ago. I was shooting in the 100s, got down to scratch last summer. Haven't played much since November mind you, but getting back out there on Tuesday.

<TEXT> Hi folks,

Are any of you members of country clubs in The Triangle area? I'm moving from Apex to Wake Forest, and I'm considering joining a country club in that area. I've been looking at the Henderson Country Club, The Hasentree Country Club, and The TPC Wakefield.  

Golf is the priority for me, with somewhere to swim and workout as secondary.

Can someone recommend a club that's worth joining?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> He honestly believes he has never said anything wrong. He's just quoting people when he says things, so how can he be wrong? That's just hilarious. He says he used quotes around wiretapping.... actually no. He used quotes twice, but there were times he didn't use quotes at all.

I'm not sure why I'm surprised to see lots of folks commenting on a subject they haven't bothered to read about or to study, being driven by their own personal biases. It's anti-intellectualism. It's widespread in a lot of online communities today.

I'm not even sure if they can help you out, but they'll know what to do. 

If you're really stuck I can help out in some way too, I could PayPal something to you.

There's days like today when I'd love to pack in my job and set up an organisation to help kids that have recently come out as atheist and been thrown to the curb by their families, but I have my own family to provide for unfortunately. It happens all the fucking time, whether you're an ex muslim or ex christian. It's always the same bullshit. Religion is a fucking cancer.

It was awkward because the bar we drank in had an off license... so they thought I was 18 and I drank in there from 15 onwards. When it was finally my 18th birthday which we had at the bar the owner pulled me aside and wasn't too happy that I'd been drinking there for three years already.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I see atheists on here regularly equating atheism with belief. It has nothing to do with belief at all, it's a lack of belief "a-theist" and the clue is directly in the name of it.  

The example given by others was that I don't believe there's a saucer with a cup on it orbiting Pluto. My non belief is not a belief. It's a lack of belief. To say "you believe there isn't, and that's a belief' is inaccurate.

Semantics, sure. But it matters. 

I'm an anti-theist, not an atheist. Even if god revealed himself/herself/itself, I would reject their authority over me.  </TEXT>

I'm really surprised the Notepad++ developers were pulling in DLLs and not verifying their signatures.

Also, just verifying if a DLL is signed isn't good enough - you should be verifying who signed it. I wouldn't be surprised if the CIA can spoof certs, or even probably sign their own DLLs. 

You really need to verify the DLL is signed by who it should be. </TEXT>

I went to the ATM last night, and had to avoid an outdoor event in the car park of an Irish bar around the corner. Everyone decided to park in around the bank. I was very lucky not to run over a few kids.

Scotland just never seed to be in control, didn't have enough of the ball. Weren't involved in the breakdown. 

Easy from England. Champions for a reason, they can kick on when needed.

Nervous for the game next week. If this weekend is anything to go by then Ireland should be destroyed in Dublin

<TEXT> I've written many essays and never had this issue... but when try to write a short story or a novel, I always come back the next day and just cringe at the whole thing. This voice inside me asks who am I trying to kid with this crap, and I end up deleting it. 

I guess I feel a lot more comfortable writing polemics.

<TEXT> If you read Letters to a Young Contrarian, Hitchens will delve into subjects and authors that inspire him. It was from reading this little pamphlet that I discovered Emile Zola. Hitchens talks about The Dreyfus Affair, so I read that after I was done with Letters to a Young Contrarian.  

The best polemical essay I have ever read, is Zola's A Plea for the Jews. It's a timeless outstanding piece of work. 

Thomas Jefferson's writing is wonderful as well and was hugely influential to Hitchens, as was the brilliant Thomas Paine.

Hitch took influence from great literature as well. Orwell, Nabokov, Saul Bellow, John Updike, Charles Dickens, Martin Amis and his father  Kingsley Amis, Evelyn Waugh, P.G. Wodehouse, Graham Greene.  

If you want to think like Hitchens you need to understand C.L.R James' Dialectics. Hitchens built his life around understanding arguments from both sides.

Read all of Hitchens essays and his books. He tells you what makes him tick in Hitch-22. Read his reviews and essays on a wide range of subjects in Arguably. 

I could go on for hours about this. </TEXT>

They carved it up in the early 1900s. Iraq didn't exist in its current form until Gertrude Bell created the borders. 

They promised the land to both Palestinian Arabs and the Jews, and then left without settling it, which set the stage for war and created the current conflict between Israel and Palestine that we see today.  

And that's without even thinking about the African colonies.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I won't rest until I can quote paragraphs of what he has said and written. There's times when I'm having a conversation with someone and I know Hitchens talked about the same topic in an essay, and I can name the essay but can't recall exactly what he said. I can paraphrase it but I always butcher it. That's frustrating, and something I strive to get better at.  

If I can recommend some more books to you. Hitchens interviewed George Packer on the subject of Orwell -- Packer put together two editions of Orwell's essays. These are a must read as well. Hitchens knew Orwell's writing intimately... and when you get to know Orwell on that level, and you read Hitchens, you can see exactly where and how Orwell influenced his thinking.

The video of their chat is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGrLDs8EdCc

Please pick up the books as well. Enjoy! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you keep that up they'll limit your account (providing you do it online). My mate Wayne Bailey that writes for the Indo, he had his account limited to something like 19c per bet.  

Mine was similar - I think it was 12c per bet. I asked them for a copy of every bet I placed on the account, and I was up close to 7 grand over 3 years.... which really amounts to fuck all when you think about it.  

This was with Powers. After that I did all my betting on Betfair... 

I closed my Betfair account when I moved to the states. Haven't bothered to keep up with the horses since then, although I will try to watch Cheltenham every year. I was never big into betting that week anyway and usually watched it for the craic. 

I do miss the horses though. Ended up having shares in two horses and that was great craic. The racing in the states is pure cack though, so I've no interest in it these days.

<TEXT>  He definitely had a soft spot for the Kurds, and never spent enough time clarifying that the invasion of Iraq could have been a well executed, justified mission, but that it wasn't. He never acknowledges it was terribly executed and that the humanitarian/terror crises haven't been improved post-invasion.

I disagree with this. I hope I don't come across as a wanker, but it seems to me that you haven't read enough of Hitchens' writing, if you think he never acknowledged how badly executed it was. He held the US accountable all along the way. 

Have you read his pamphlet on Iraq? Have you watched his debates on Iraq? Have you read this? https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/14/christopher-hitchens-cancer-interview

Hitchens wasn't wrong on Iraq. It was going to implode pretty soon anyway, and it was important that the US had some say in how that implosion went. He argued that the US was pulling out too soon and didn't do enough to help the Iraqi people. That's on the US, not on Hitchens.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I left the country in 2011, and back then it was bad but not *terrible* however I know there's loads of people on trolleys in corridors now, often dying in them in as well. My sister's husband had a first cousin that died on a trolley from a heart attack something like 36 hours after being referred for a suspected heart attack from his GP and he was never looked at. I think this happened around 2012.  

Anyway, the reason I ask is my sister is having a four/five hour surgery today. She was brought in last night and spent the night on a trolley in a corridor.... there's no bed for her after the surgery so she'll be going back to the corridor for post-op recovery. She has VHI as well, not that it matters - there's just no beds because of all the hospitals in the region that the government decided to close.  

She's in Limerick regional, but I'm sure it's the same story all over. Is anyone in government committed to opening more hospitals?  

Sorry I realise this is probably discussed ad nauseum on the news but I haven't been tuning into RTE too often from over here. </TEXT>

This shit has to stop. It's a fucking domestic competition. They say this shit every year.

Oh so I could create a sport that only I play and claim to be a world champion? No.  

The NFL is the National Football League for fucks sake. National being the key word. It's a domestic sport, a domestic competition. It's not nations competing from every continent so you're not world champions you arrogant wankers.

<TEXT> I probably should have added why I was making the argument in the first place. I'm from Ireland, and a vast majority of people I know back home in Europe blame US intervention for the creation of Islamic terrorism. My aim was to show it existed prior to the US existing, with the example of Baltimore, Jeffersons writing, and then to show what ISIS really want because regular folks haven't read their propaganda.

I should expand on this.

<TEXT> **DEATHS**  

1) **John (Jackie) Duddy**. Shot in the chest in the car park of Rossville flats. Four witnesses stated Duddy was unarmed and running away from the paratroopers when he was killed. Three of them saw a soldier take deliberate aim at the youth as he ran. His nephew is Irish boxer John Duddy.[31]  
2) **Patrick Joseph Doherty**. Shot from behind while attempting to crawl to safety in the forecourt of Rossville flats. Doherty was the subject of a series of photographs, taken before and after he died by French journalist Gilles Peress. Despite testimony from "Soldier F" that he had fired at a man holding and firing a pistol, Widgery acknowledged that the photographs showed Doherty was unarmed, and that forensic tests on his hands for gunshot residue proved negative.[31][34]  
3) **Bernard McGuigan**. Shot in the back of the head when he went to help Patrick Doherty. He had been waving a white handkerchief at the soldiers to indicate his peaceful intentions.[4]  
4) **Hugh Pius Gilmour**. Shot through his right elbow, the bullet then entering his chest as he ran from the paratroopers on Rossville Street.[31] Widgery acknowledged that a photograph taken seconds after Gilmour was hit corroborated witness reports that he was unarmed, and that tests for gunshot residue were negative.[4]  
5) **Kevin McElhinney**. Shot from behind while attempting to crawl to safety at the front entrance of the Rossville Flats. Two witnesses stated McElhinney was unarmed.[31]  
6) **Michael Gerald Kelly**. Shot in the stomach while standing near the rubble barricade in front of Rossville Flats. Widgery accepted that Kelly was unarmed.[31]  
7) **John Pius Young**. Shot in the head while standing at the rubble barricade. Two witnesses stated Young was unarmed.[31]  
8) **William Noel Nash**. Shot in the chest near the barricade. Witnesses stated Nash was unarmed and going to the aid of another when killed.[31]  
9) **Michael M. McDaid**. Shot in the face at the barricade as he was walking away from the paratroopers. The trajectory of the bullet indicated he could have been killed by soldiers positioned on the Derry Walls.[31]  
10) **William Anthony McKinney**. Shot through the upper right back, with the bullet then exiting through his lower left chest[35] as he attempted to flee through Glenfada Park.[36][37]  
11) **James Joseph Wray**. Wounded then shot again at close range while lying on the ground. Witnesses who were not called to the Widgery Tribunal stated that Wray was calling out that he could not move his legs before he was shot the second time.[31]  
12) **Gerald Donaghey**. Shot in the stomach while attempting to run to safety between Glenfada Park and Abbey Park. Donaghey was brought to a nearby house by bystanders where he was examined by a doctor. His pockets were turned out in an effort to identify him. A later police photograph of Donaghey's corpse showed nail bombs in his pockets. Neither those who searched his pockets in the house nor the British army medical officer (Soldier 138) who pronounced him dead shortly afterwards say they saw any bombs. Donaghey had been a member of Fianna ireann, an IRA-linked Republican youth movement.[31] Paddy Ward, a police informer[38] who gave evidence at the Saville Inquiry, claimed that he had given two nail bombs to Donaghey several hours before he was shot dead.[39]  
13) **Gerard (James) McKinney**. Shot just after Gerald Donaghey. Witnesses stated that McKinney had been running behind Donaghey, and he stopped and held up his arms, shouting "Don't shoot! Don't shoot!", when he saw Donaghey fall. He was then shot in the chest.[31]  
14) **John Johnston**. Shot in the leg and left shoulder on William Street 15 minutes before the rest of the shooting started.[31][40] Johnston was not on the march, but on his way to visit a friend in Glenfada Park.[40] He died 4 months later; his death has been attributed to the injuries he received on the day. He was the only one not to die immediately or soon after being shot.[31]

"Noon would comeshe would hurry along Fifth Avenue, a Nordic Ganymede, her fur coat swinging fashionably with her steps, her cheeks redder by a stroke of the wind's brush, her breath a delightful mist upon the bracing airand the doors of the Ritz would revolve, the crowd would divide, fifty masculine eyes would start, stare, as she gave back forgotten dreams to the husbands of many obese and comic women." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fair play /u/JebNorth this is great to see. I'm a fairly avid reader so I would have some interest in this. I'll join in every so often. 

I'm not trying to sound like a wanker by not fully committing, it's just that I've already set myself up to read 80 fucking books this year. I managed 56 last year, so I'm aiming for 80 this time around. So If I join in here I'd be removing some of the ones I already picked out. 

I'm starting a new job on the 23rd and the job should free me up quite a bit. In 2014 I managed to read something like 150 books when the job I had was fairly easy going for that year. 

Most of the 80 books I want to read this year are re-reads from that list of 150, because I ploughed through them and I've forgotten quite a bit of them at this stage. The idea is to read them and make some notes - so something like this where you discuss each book would be fucking ideal man.

<TEXT> More than 45 million people, or 14.5 percent of all Americans, lived below the poverty line last year.

1.2 Trillion / 45 million = 26666.666 (note the number - hah).  

If you give  26666.666 to every person below the poverty line, they wouldn't be below the poverty line anymore. It literally is enough to solve poverty in this country, as the poverty line for a 1 person home is $14,720.  

So the industry has enough tax free money to solve poverty ever year, but does fuck all - why? Because poor people are typically uneducated and they are easy to manipulate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In order to keep track of how long certain tasks took - like calling a web service, or transfering a file we typically do the following:
    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    // some action
    long duration = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
    statistics.put("ACTION_TIME", duration);

I found Apache Common's StopWatch, but ultimately ran into threading issues as it's not threadsafe.  

I wrote a thread-safe alternative... but I consider it a bit of a hack and wanted to know how you great folks do the above in a threadsafe manner?

<TEXT> Hi lads/ladies,

I'm considering putting together a small website with a database to keep track of arrests and allow us to query for various metrics.

Having it linked in with Google maps would be a plus, especially for Pastors arrested for child related offences - highlighting nearby schools, etc.

I'm hoping this would get this issue the attention it deserves.

Other than a site, with a DB and Google maps integration, is there anything else you'd like to see on there? I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas on this.

**EDIT** Apologies for the lack of progress on this. I'm in the middle of buying a house and the whole mortgage process is fucking terrible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not at all. I used to when I was a child, as I was indoctrinated as most people are/were. I was even an alter boy (by choice) for a few years as a child as well. The last service I performed was my grandfather's funeral which was quite beautiful. He was the mayor of our small town of 9000 people or so, and close to 1000 attended the funeral.  

I've studied various religions for a long time now; over twenty years at this point, focusing mostly on the three monotheism's but not limited to those three. I've read lots about Buddhism for example, and I often meditate for short periods and practice mindfulness as it's extremely useful but that religion itself is hogwosh (my opnion of course, this whole post is).  

I've read the works of Hitchens, Dawkins, Dennet, Krauss, Paine, Spinoza, and so on. Their work is very compelling. There's lots of debates with Hitchens as well, and if you haven't seen any of those I encourage you to check them out.  

The bible is an awfully violent book and it's clear that it was made up by man, not the word of god. Paine made a great case for this - cities changed names for example, and a story in the bible was supposed to have been written   recorded in time n, and then in n+800 years the town's name changed to x, but the bible has the town's name recorded as the name from n+800, not the original name.... so it can't have been written when it was claimed. That's just one example of many.  

I also abhor the thought that there is an totalitarian regime up there watching everything one does and says, and judges you. That's just disgusting really. It's all nonsense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When Christopher Hitchens was diagnosed with cancer, he wrote a collection of essays for his various columns with Vanity Fair, Slate, etc which are collected into a book called Mortality.  

It's a great read for anyone that has a fear of dying and/or death.  

He wasn't afraid of the process, but he didn't like that the party went on without him. The thought that papers would come out the day after he died and he would have no idea what was written in them. I thought this was an interesting perspective.  

Nothing really scares me about it. I look forward to it in a way. Obviously dying too soon is something I want to avoid, I don't want to give my family/friends unnecessary grief. 

The thought of thinking for ALL ETERNITY scares me crap out of me, so I look forward to dying and being just like it was before I was born. </TEXT>

They handled it better this time because the snow didn't hit before lads left the office, it hit late at night so nobody needed to be on the roads.  

It's bad enough though, we got ice, then snow, then ice again. It's very dangerous. I have friends that moved to Canada trying to take the piss, but without winter tyres, salt on the roads, and ploughs they'd be in the same boat we are.  

Doesn't matter a fuck, ice is ice you can't drive on it. I lived further north and lived through loads of blizzards. It was safer up there than here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got my honours BSc in Ireland for "free". I paid 700 euro per year, and that was it. Those were "admin fees".  

I am forever grateful for this. I live in the states now and my wife has student debt, like most other people. 

I had to sit exams to get into college - I couldn't just walk into it. At the end of secondary school (high school), I sat exams in every subject I was taking, and how I did determined which schools I could get into. The exam structure was the same as college exam structures as well, so it was great training for college/university.  

Does anyone know if this is something Sanders supports - "free" education for all who are capable - means tested by examinations/education?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I didn't see any posts on here about Tom Coyne's book: A Course Called Ireland: A Long Walk in Search of a Country, a Pint, and the Next Tee.

Amazon link here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QREWNW

My wife bought the book for me as a Christmas present, and I've been unable to put it down. Tom walked the coast of Ireland, playing in loads of links courses all around the country.

I'm from Ireland myself so I was really interested in hearing his thoughts on the courses, and the craic he had along the way. 

It's a really easy read, and Tom captures the Irish spirit and mentality quite well. I would have loved to have played a round with him while he was traveling around.

Has anyone else read this? What did you think of it?

<TEXT> Hitchens, in one of his debates, said that people in the area could not read/write at that time in Palestine. He used it as an argument against it ever happening - why didn't god send down his son to an area where they could read/write in China. Surely if he had have wanted to spread the message in the most effective way he would have sent his son (or is it himself, I can never work that out) there.  

In fact, given that we have the Internet today, it would be pretty damn effective to send his son down now wouldn't it? 

Now that I mention it, there are a lot of people in that area today who think they are Jesus. Could it be the whole thing was just mass hysteria, and that Abraham was really just a guy with epilepsy/schizophrenia? Bingo!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I brought my wife to the ER at 8am on Christmas Eve. We didn't get home until 4am Christmas morning. Slept for 5 hours, went to the chemist to get her medication (they're open on Christmas Day which is awful but thank fuck they were). Got home and opened gifts with her in bed. 

She's confined to bed for the next few days so I brought up some Christmas lights and put them around the room to give it a bit of a Christmas vibe. Made the dinner and then had dinner in bed. I cleaned up down stairs and was coming up to watch a movie with her but she had passed out so I let her sleep for a few hours and I broke open a bottle of Midleton Dair Gaeltacht I had been saving.  

Watched the sun go down and just chilled for a while. I woke my wife up then to take the last of her medication and we watched a show in bed. 

It was very peaceful. No hangover today either which is magic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ten Men Dead is a fantastic read from "The Troubles" period.  

If you want to go back a bit further in time then have a read of Tom Barry's book Guerrilla Days in Ireland. It's spectacular.   
  
Ernie O'Malley wrote some fantastic books as well, the best being On Another Man's Wound. He wrote a few others so check them out as well (The Singing Flame, The Men Will Talk to Me, etc)  

Richard English wrote the definitive book called Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA. I believe it's the best unbiased book on the history of the conflict.  

He also wrote Ernie O'Malley: IRA Intellectual and that's worth checking out as well, but only after you've read Ernie's other books above.  

Don't forget Ruairi O' Bradaigh: The Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me it wasn't just family, it was "friends". I remember removing someone I went to school with - and hadn't seen in person in over 15 years - because they just seemed to post game invites. Their account looked like a bloody spam account.  

I ran into them a couple of years later and I barely recognised them, but they stopped me in the street and were extremely upset that I deleted them from Facebook a few years prior.  

It was an odd experience because we never even talked on Facebook, not even once.  

I annoyed a lot of people on Facebook as well, because my sense of humour is different than some people I guess. I was joking about something and I can't even remember what it was now - and laughing with my wife about it - and they'd be messaging my wife wondering why I'm so upset over something... and there I was laughing about it with her clearly not upset at all. 

I also didn't like the culture behind it - only taking photos of things just so you can post them on your Facebook page is a definitive form of narcissism, and it's clearly driving behaviour changes as well. 

I deleted Facebook for around 14 or 16 months, but I created a new account to connect with my Uncle and I haven't removed it yet. I see the value of being able to see family photos at Christmas time, and stuff like that. I live on another continent than they do, and I try not to get involved in anything political on there anymore.  

In the year or so without Facebook, I learned to value friendships a lot more, and I would call people and actually talk to them over the phone instead of texting/chatting on social media. It was a lot more personal for me. I also wasn't wasting time scrolling through a mixture of adverts   posts from friends/family. The "news feed" is clearly advert driven these days, with lots of "Sponsored" items appearing.  </TEXT>

This is one of the most complex, nicest whiskies I've had. It's not as nice as the 50 year old from last year's advent calendar, but it's not far off. 

Given all the effort that went into making this - the story behind it - I'm in love. This should have been whiskey of the year. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Christopher Hitchens on the burka (x-post from /r/atheism) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-23 16:09:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I posted this on the atheism sub but I'll post it here as well:

During a Q A session from his Hitch-22 tour at The Free Library of Philadelphia, Hitchens had the following to say about the burka:

I dislike the way that the discussion around the Burka and other forms of veiling and enveloping of females is always referred to as a ban especially as its been applied or proposed in France. Its not a ban, its the lifting of a ban on the right of women to choose what they can wear. The existing state of affairs is a ban by the male members of a religious cult organisation known as Islam. They believe they have the right to dictate the atire of their women. I think that ban should be lifted. They cant do it in France. Thats just to say about the rights of the women concerned. If you counterpose to that  well why cant a woman wear anything she wants, youd have to give me some evidence that there was ever a woman that wanted to go out in the street only with her husbands permission and only wearing the curtains. Theres no evidence of that at all, theres a great deal of evidence the other way. 

Suppose she did make that choice however, lets allow it. She would come directly into conflict with my right to see her face. Im not going to allow people to wear masks in the street. Ill give you an example, The Klu Klux Klan is a Christian identity organisation. Its better known as a racist one. Theres not much of a difference between racism and Christian identity in this case, but thats what it always is and has been. It has in my opinion the perfect right to wear the hood at a rally under the first ammendment that is protected by the police and with various regulations. But no Klan members are to be allowed to wear that to work. If a Klan member is a nurse or a teacher or a bus driver well Im sorry  no. Why cant you go to the bank with that, either? What could be plainer than this? 

We have excellent cultural reasons for expression such as what have you got to hide? He doesnt dare show his face. These are things that have evolved over a long long time and now these people want to shut down the public square and imprison women into the bargain, and empower a group that has much bigger ambitions than this for changing our identiy and modifying our society and it would as well to stop it now while we can.  

I've seen plenty of regressive leftists say that the "ban on the burka" is a way of dictating that women can and cannot wear, and I think this is an excellent counter point to that. 

Any thoughts on this?

<TEXT> I moved from Ireland to the states in 2011, and I haven't been back home in 4 years or so. Since I moved here, every Christmas has been.... different. The meals just aren't the same. Don't get me wrong, they are still lovely but they're just different. The meat here isn't as good as back home, not by a long shot.  

Anyway, I was talking about this in my local last night - owned by two lads from back in Ireland. One is from Roscommon and I think the other lad is from Offaly. One of the owners walks out with a head of cabbage for me and says he'll have an 8 pound Irish ham for me on Wednesday as well. He could get me a 16 pound one if I wanted but that's a bit much haha.  

What an absolute legend. It might not seem like a lot if you're used to having it every year, but try going without it for a few years and it'll one of the things you'll pine for around this time of year. 

I'm fucking delighted. Merry Everyone!

<TEXT> Have you read Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland by Anne Cadwallader? It's a very tough read because of how upsetting it is. It documents the case of a young boy of 10 years of age or so, that was shot by the Paras, and they dragged him into a van and stuck the tips of their guns into his wounds and pissed on him, then dumped him out of the van. Some seriously sick and fucked up shit went on in an attempt to drag the IRA into a sectarian conflict.  

I might give this a read, cheers.

Anyway, I was put on Tramadol in 2014. It has changed my life. I can function as a person again. If I have a couple of pints I feel sleepy, so I don't drink that much. I haven't been properly drunk in a long long time actually. So I knew there was a bit of a session going to be happening one weekend so I decided to cut back on Tramadol so I could drink a bit. I didn't want to be dumb and try to drink loads while taking the drug. I ended up in the A E not because of drinking, but because of withdrawal from tramadol. I was dizzy, kept falling over, it was like vertigo. I'd move my eyes and my ears pulsed like crazy. They pumped me full of every drug they had in the hospital and nothing worked. I told them I had stopped taking tramadol a couple of days ago and they were convinced it's not addictive and that's not the problem. I was discharged, and within 30 minutes of taking tramadol at home all of my symptoms disappeared.  

The fucked up thing is that I was never told this would happen to me when being prescribed the drug. I asked if it was addictive and I was told no. Addiction isn't some mental weakness as it is sometimes portrayed, my doctors pumped me full of this shit and now my body needs it to function. I've asked to be put on something else but I've been told every drug they give me will have similar results. 

I need to function as a person, to be able to get out of bed and work, but for all I know I could drop dead in 10 or 20 years from using pain killers on a daily basis. My heart could easily give in.

<TEXT> I have that post Lost depression. It's also Sunday night and the thoughts of going back to work tomorrow... ugh. 

What a show, what a journey. I still love every bit of it. I just creeped on Jin   Sawyer's Instagram accounts and it seems like they're doing pretty good with their post Lost lives. Josh Holloway is in a new show called Colony that I guess I should check out. Looks like Daniel Dae Kim is still in Hawaii Five-0 so he gets to live on the island for quite a while - lucky him! 

Lost had it all - pure escapism at its finest. The chance of just dropping it all and changing you are and living on a gorgeous island, but they could never sit still and were always on the go and never really got to enjoy it. I tried to take it all in this time I watched it but before I knew it the show was over again. The music is outstanding too. I'll be listening to the soundtrack in work tomorrow for sure. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Planning a trip home with a few lads. Quick Question about The Blasket Islands. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-07 17:24:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> How's the form lads/ladies.

I haven't been home in over three years and I'm planning a month in Ireland next summer. I'm bringing a group of friends with me as they've never been to Ireland so we're going on the lash for a few days. They'll be with me for 10 days or so. 

I have most of the trip planned - but had one question about The Blasket Islands. I know the boats only run when the weather permits, and the sea is often too rough for it. Do any of you know if you're allowed to camp on the islands over night? I was hoping to stay there over night if possible, but I wasn't sure if it's considered protected land now or not.  

According to the following it looks [possible](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g211861-d216389-r218040667-Great_Blasket_Island-Dingle_Dingle_Peninsula_County_Kerry.html) , but just wondering if any of you lads have done it, and if so is there any advice you can give? Cheers!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure why you were down voted - probably because you like expensive whiskey.  

I'm from Ireland, moved to the states in 2011. I have a huge Irish selection at home - stocked up last year. Writers Tears is very good, probably one of my favourite Irish whiskies at this point. It's hard to have a favourite though, some days I love Green Spot, some days I'll go for Barry Crockett, some days I'll go for Powers John Lane, some days I'll go for Redbreast 21 year old....but one I keep coming back to is Writers Tears. I have 3 bottles of it - all purchased last year. I started drinking whiskey again recently as the cold weather is back now, and it's just so fucking nice. My god.

Sorry for the rant.  </TEXT>

**EDIT** they are seeing if they can give me a refund/credit. The girl that handled the call said it looks like it is their fault. I went through a toll after I had ordered my transponder but it wasn't delivered yet -- but I had asked them if I could do that before doing it and they said yes -- but they created a separate account when I did it and I didn't know about it.

It was closer to 6 bucks too, not the $1.97 I was initially told about. </TEXT>

<TITLE> NC QuickPass Shenanigans. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-29 19:01:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I went to pay my tax   registration today but was told I had to pay my tolls first, with NC quick pass.  

My account balance appeared to be 104 bucks, so I paid that. I noticed I also paid 100 bucks on the 16th. After paying 104 bucks my account was actually in credit for 205 dollars. I didn't owe anything. 

But I still couldn't pay because of tolls. I called NC QuickPass, and apparently my responder didn't work for one toll back in September 2015. The toll was for $1.97. Instead of adding this to the account I have with NC QuickPass, they opened another account for me and put the charge there. I had no idea about this, and as a result I owed $200 on this account because it wasn't paid.

I got a letter or two from NC QuickPass but I thought the charges were just from my responder account and thought nothing of it - they would be paid on auto pay.

Well yeah, that didn't work out well. This seems like it's designed to make people not realise a new account has been opened (without their permission), and that it will incur charges.

I ended up paying it, but I'm extremely fucking annoyed at this bullshit. Has this happened to anyone else? </TEXT>

For example, Deuteronomy 18:11-12 condemns anyone who "..casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you", and Exodus 22:18 states "Do not allow a sorceress to live".  

I could give plenty more examples but you get the drift I am sure.

<TITLE> Notes from Letters to a Young Contrarian. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-17 15:18:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I read Letters to a Young Contrarian 4 - 6 times per year, every year since I first picked it up back in 2005.  

I have several copies of the book, one of which is autographed and is quite dear to me given Hitchens' unfortunate demise.  

I'm half way through my current reading, and figured I would post my notes thus far because a lot of it is appropriate given the current US political climate. Pay close attention to what Hitchens says about polls. I'll update this thread as I continue my journey through this little pamphlet. 

I attack and criticise people myself; I have no right to expect lenience in return.  

Bill Clintons approving Presidential initials were found on a note written by his half-brother Roger, who had been engaged in trying to obtain a pardon for a drug-dealer and also engaged in explaining how hed come by a brick-thick block of travelers checks. There was the usual obfuscation about no proven quid pro quo but I noticed, in the aftermath of the Rich pardon, that it had been several months since Id been able to get into a fight over whether Clinton was a cheap crook or not. Believe me, I remember when this was otherwise.  

Adlai Stevenson once said to Richard Nixon: If you stop telling lies about me Ill stop telling the truth about you.  

So this was an amazing and wondrous month; perhaps the best of my life. (I finished my centennial study of George Orwell in the same period. Much more civilised to be writing about him than any of the above.) I tell you about it not just in order to boast, though there is that. It went to make up for many, many other months, when the celebrity culture and the spin-scum and the crooked lawyers and pseudo-statesmen and clerics seemed to have everything their own way. They will be back, of course. They are always back. They never leave. But their victory is not pre-determined. And there are vindications to be had as well, far sweeter than anything contained in the meretricious illusion of good notices or a good press.  

The noble title of dissident must be earned rather than claimed; it connotes sacrifice and risk rather than mere disagreement, and it has been consecrated by many exemplary and courageous men and women.  

When a precious and irreplaceable word like irony has become a lazy synonym for anomie, there is scant room for originality.  

Its too much to expect to live in an age that is actually propitious for dissent. And most people, most of the time, prefer to seek approval or security. Nor should this surprise us (and nor, incidentally, are those desires contemptible in themselves). Nonetheless, there are in all periods people who feel themselves in some fashion to be apart. And it is not too much to say that humanity is very much in debt to such people, whether it chooses to acknowledge the debt or not. (Dont expect to be thanked, by the way. The life of an oppositionist is supposed to be difficult.)  

The essence of the independent mind lies not in what it thinks, but in how it thinks.  

The term intellectual was originally coined by those in France who believed in the guilt of Captain Alfred Dreyfus. They thought that they were defending an organic, harmonious and ordered society against nihilism, and they deployed this contemptuous word against those they regarded as the diseased, the introspective, the disloyal and the unsound. The word hasnt completely lost this association even now, though it is less frequently used as an insult. (And, like Tory, impressionist and suffragette, all of them originated as terms of abuse or scorn, it has been annexed by some of its targets and worn with pride.) One feels something of the same sense of embarrassment in claiming to be an intellectual as one does in purporting to be a dissident, but the figure of Emile Zola offers encouragement, and his singular campaign for justice is one of the imperishable examples of what may be accomplished by an individual.  

There is a saying from Roman antiquity: Fiat justitiaruat caelum. Do justice, and let the skies fall. In every epoch, there have been those to argue that greater goods, such as tribal solidarity or social cohesion, take precedence over the demands of justice. It is supposed to be an axiom of Western civilisation that the individual, or the truth, may not be sacrificed to hypothetical benefits such as order. But in point of fact, such immolations have been very common. To the extent that the ideal is at least paid lip service, this result is the outcome of individual struggles against the collective instinct for a quiet life.  

Emile Zola could be the pattern for any serious and humanistic radical, because he not only asserted the inalienable rights of the individual, but generalised his assault to encompass the vile role played by clericalism, by racial hatred, by militarism and by the fetishisation of the nation and the state.  

Anti-Semites among our young men? They do exist then, do they? This idiotic poison has really already overthrown their intellects and corrupted their souls? What a saddening, what a disquieting element for the twentieth century which is about to dawn. A hundred years after the Declaration of the Rights of Man, a hundred years after the supreme act of tolerance and emancipation, we go back to religious warfare, to the most odious and the most stupid of fanaticisms!  

A shameful terror reigns, the bravest turn cowards, and no one dares say what he thinks for fear of being denounced as a traitor and a bribe-taker. The few newspapers which at first stood out for justice are now crawling in the dust before their readers...  

Its always as well to remember, when considering miscarriages of justice, as the authorities so neutrally and quaintly like to call them, that the framing of the innocent axiomatically involves the exculpation of the guilty. This is abortion, not miscarriage.  

Read Zola with care and you will be less astonished by the follies and crimesfrom Verdun to Vichythat later overtook France, and indeed overtook an entire Europe of show trials and camps and martial parades and infallible leaders. You will also understand better why it is that the papacy, which now seems to try again almost every day, can never manage an honest or clear statement on its history with Jews, Protestants and unbelievers. And all of this can be derived from one determined and principled individual exercising his right to say no, and insisting (as Zola successfully did) on his day, not in court as we again too neutrally say, but in the dock.  

courage is not in itself one of the primary virtues, it is the quality that makes the exercise of the virtues possible.  

Galileo may have made a discovery that overthrew the complacent cosmology of the Church fathers, but when threatened with the instruments of torture he also made a swift recantation. The sun and the planets were, of course, unaffected by this disavowal, and the latter continued to revolve around the former whatever the Vatican said. (Galileo himself, as he finished his recantation, may or may not have murmured, epur si muoveIt still does move.)  

Incidentally, it now seems more and more certain that Zola was murdered in his bed, rather than accidentally stifled by a faulty fire and a blocked chimney; further proof that great men are most frequently not honored in their own time or country.  

One of the hardest things for anyone to face is the conclusion that his or her own side is in the wrong when engaged in a war. The pressure to keep silent and be a team player is reinforceable by the accusations of cowardice or treachery that will swiftly be made against dissenters. Sinister phrases of coercion, such as stabbing in the back or giving ammunition to the enemy, have their origin in this dilemma and are always available to help compel unanimity.  

As so often, the determination of one individual was enough to dishearten those whose courage was mob-derived.  

Quite often, the baptism of a future dissenter occurs in something unplanned, such as a spontaneous resistance to an episode of bullying or bigotry, or a challenge to some piece of pedagogical stupidity. There is good reason to think that such reactions arise from something innate rather than something inculcated  

Noam Chomsky recalls hearing the news of the obliteration of Hiroshima as a young man, and experiencing the need to go off and find solitude because there was nobody he felt he could talk to. It would be encouraging to believe that such reactions are innate, because then we can be certain that they will continue to occur, and will not depend for their occurrence upon the transmission of good examples or morality tales.  

To be in opposition is not to be a nihilist. And there is no decent or charted way of making a living at it. It is something you are, and not something you do.  

I am always and at once on the defensive, for example, when people speak of races and nations as if they were personalities and had souls and destinies and suchlike.  

There is only one thing you should do. Go into yourself. Find out the reason that commands you to write; see whether it has spread its roots into the very depths of your heart; confess to yourself whether you would have to die if you were forbidden to write. This most of all; ask yourself in the most silent hour of your night: must I write? Dig into yourself for a deep answer. And if this answer rings out in assent, if you meet this question with a strong, simple I must, then build your life in accordance with this necessity  

the decision to live at a slight acute angle to society.  

But contradiction is of the essence: many of my own favorite poets in English, from Kipling to Larkin, have achieved great and splendid effects in spite of, as well as because of, their affinity with ethical conservatism, sometimes in its radical forms.  

I accept all of Rilkes implied challenges because of what he wrote about solitude, and the ways in which it must be welcomed rather than feared. In the mental and moral equipment of a radical or critical personality, this realisation is of the essence. Rilke also allows me to touch on matters such as the inevitable disappointment of religion and worship, the defining importance of language, the combat between the tribal and the cosmopolitan, the fate of MittelEuropa, the still-poisonous influence of the First World War, the effect of Freud, and the recurring importance of the ironic.  

You seem to have grasped the point that there is something idiotic about those who believe that consensus (to give the hydra-headed beast just one of its names) is the highest good.  

As a species, we may by all means think ruefully about the waste and horror produced by war and other forms of rivalry and jealousy. However, this cant alter the fact that in life we make progress by conflict and in mental life by argument and disputation. The concept of the dialectic may well have been partly discredited by its advocates, but that does not permit us to disown it. There must be confrontation and opposition, in order that sparks may be kindled.  

Tautology lurks, and waits to enclose you.  

If you care about the points of agreement and civility, then, you had better be well-equipped with points of argument and combativity, because if you are not then the center will be occupied and defined without your having helped to decide it, or determine what and where it is.  

Shoes and minds, said this sign, must be left at the gate. Laughable of course, but evil if it could be enforced, as it often was under Loyolas Jesuitical injunction Dei sacrificium intellectus; an immodest and hysterical desire to annihilate the intellect at the feet of an idol.  

The second, which is only a corollary of the first, is that we do not naturally aspire to any hazy, narcotic Nirvana, where our critical and ironic faculties would be of no use to us. Imagine a state of endless praise and gratitude and adoration, as the Testaments ceaselessly enjoin us to do, and you have conjured a world of hellish nullity and conformism. Imagine a state of bliss and perpetual happiness and harmony, and you have summoned a vision of tedium and pointlessness and predictability, such as Huxley with all his gifts was only able to sketch.  

Always look to the language.  

It is true that the odds in favor of stupidity or superstition or unchecked authority seem intimidating and that vast stretches of human time have seemingly elapsed with no successful challenge to these things. But it is no less true that there is an ineradicable instinct to see beyond, or through, these tyrannical conditions. One way of phrasing it might be to say that injustice and irrationality are inevitable parts of the human condition, but that challenges to them are inevitable also.  

On Sigmund Freuds memorial in Vienna appear the words: The voice of reason is small, but very persistent.  

there are some flashes of human intelligence that rise above the merely contrary and that can show us how some of our predecessors dealt with fiercer opposition than we face at present.  

Alain, in Martin du Gards Lieutenant Colonel Maumort says that the first rulehe calls it the rule of rulesis the art of challenging what is appealing. You will notice that he describes this as an art: it is not enough simply to set oneself up as a person who distrusts majority taste as a matter of principle or perhaps conceit; that way lies snobbery and frigidity. However, it will very often be found that people are highly attached to illusions or prejudices, and are not just the sullen victims of dogma or orthodoxy.  

If you have ever argued with a religious devotee, for example, you will have noticed that his self-esteem and pride are involved in the dispute and that you are asking him to give up something more than a point in argument.  

From this caution I pass to an observation of the late Sir Karl Popper, who could himself be a tyrant in argument but who nonetheless recognised that argument was valuable, indeed essential, for its own sake. It is very seldom, as he noticed, that in debate any one of two evenly matched antagonists will succeed in actually convincing or converting the other. But it is equally seldom that in a properly conducted argument either antagonist will end up holding exactly the same position as that with which he began. Concessions, refinements and adjustments will occur, and each initial position will have undergone modification even if it remains ostensibly the same. Not even the most apparently glacial system is immune to this rule.  

George Orwell said that the prime responsibility lay in being able to tell people what they did not wish to hear.  

John Stuart Mill (who by a nice chance was Bertrand Russells godfather) said that even if all were agreed on an essential proposition it would be essential to give an ear to the one person who did not, lest people forget how to justify their original agreement.  

Rosa Luxemburg roundly declared that freedom was first and last the freedom for those who thought differently.  

John Milton in his Areopagitica proclaimed that, whatever one believed to be the right, it should be exposed to the claims of the wrong, because only in a fair and open fight could the right claim or expect vindication.  

Frederick Douglass announced that those who expected truth or justice without a struggle were like those who could imagine the sea without an image of the tempest.  

In place of honest disputation we are offered platitudes about healing. The idea of unity is granted huge privileges over any notion of division or, worse, divisiveness. I cringe every time I hear denunciations of the politics of divisionas if politics was not division by definition.  

You should scan Brian Victorias excellent book Zen at War, which, written as it is by a Buddhist priest, exposes the dire role played by Zen obedience and discipline in the formation of pre-war Japanese imperialism.  

we are mammals, and the prefrontal lobe (at least while we wait for genetic engineering) is too small while the adrenaline gland is too big.  

If you find yourself, as Basil Davidson did, in mortal conflict with a hateful foreign occupation, then you can be forgiven for being a zealot and even criticised for not being one.  

If you want to stay in for the long haul, and lead a life that is free from illusions either propagated by you or embraced by you, then I suggest you learn to recognise and avoid the symptoms of the zealot and the person who knows that he is right. For the dissenter, the skeptical mentality is at least as important as any armor of principle.  

And it was in order to survive those years of stalemate and realpolitik that a number of important dissidents evolved a strategy for survival. In a phrase, they decided to live as if.  

Im never certain which author can claim the credit for this mild-sounding but actually deeply subversive and ironic decision. Vaclav Havel, then working as a marginal playwright and poet in a society and state that truly merited the title of Absurd, realised that resistance in its original insurgent and militant sense was impossible in the Central Europe of the day. He therefore proposed living as if  he were a citizen of a free society, as if  lying and cowardice were not mandatory patriotic duties, as if his government had actually signed (which it actually had) the various treaties and agreements that enshrine universal human rights. He called this tactic The Power of the Powerless because, even when disagreement can be almost forbidden, a state that insists on actually compelling assent can be relatively easily made to look stupid. You cant achieve 100 percent control over humans, and if you could, you could not go on doing so. It isfortunatelytoo much responsibility for any human to assume, not that this keeps the control freaks from continuing to try.  

At around the same time and alarmed in a different way by many of the same things (the morbid relationship of the Cold War to the nuclear arms race), Professor E.P. Thompson, whom I recommended to you earlier, proposed that we live as if  a free and independent Europe already existed.  

The process often involved an inversion in the usual relationship between the ironic and the literal. The People Power moment of 1989, when whole populations brought down their absurd rulers by an exercise of arm-folding and sarcasm, had its origins partly in the Philippines in 1985, when the dictator Marcos called an opportunist snap election and the voters decided to take him seriously. They acted as if the vote were free and fair, and they made it so. (The forgotten fact that the Soviet ambassador to Manila took the side of Marcos was also a portent of a kind.)  

One could add further examples. In the late Victorian period, Oscar Wildemaster of the pose but not a mere poseurdecided to live and act as if  moral hypocrisy were not regnant. In the Deep South in the early 1960s, Rosa Parks (after some arduous dress rehearsals of her own) decided to act as if a hardworking black woman could sit down on a bus at the end of the days labor. In Moscow in the 1970s, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn resolved to write as if  an individual scholar could investigate the history of his own country, and publish his findings. They all, by behaving literally, acted ironically. In each case, as we know now, the authorities were forced first to act crassly and then to look crass, and eventually to fall victim to stern verdicts from posterity. However, this was by no means the guaranteed outcome and there must have been days when the as if  style was exceedingly hard to keep up.  

I can recommend, therefore (apart from the study of these and other good examples) is that you try to cultivate some of this attitude. In an average day, you may well be confronted with some species of bullying or bigotry, or some ill-phrased appeal to the general will, or some petty abuse of authority. If you have a political loyalty, you may be offered a shady reason for agreeing to a lie or a half-truth that serves some short-term purpose. Everybody devises tactics for getting through such moments; try behaving as if they need not be tolerated and are not inevitable.  

Im no great advocate of folkloric wisdom, but this tale has stood the test because it emphasises what Orwell once said in another context: very often the hardest thing to see is what is right in front of your nose. And there is, not infrequently, a considerable social pressure not to take note of the obvious. Every parent knows the moment when children acquire the word why and begin to make use of it. I still dont know quite why the sky is blue (I did know, once, but Ive forgotten) but Ive had to find explanations for Daddy, why is that man sleeping on a grating? and for other phenomena that I had become too much used to. In societies infected by the poison of racism, it has often been children (who dont suffer innately from the infection) who have set the example. Of course, one should not idealise children, who are very suggestible and who make easy targets for indoctrination.  

You have to be sophisticated by experience before you are old enough to argue that, say, it might be wrong to launch a thermonuclear war but not wrong, indeed only prudent, to prepare the weaponry of extermination. Or that an act that would be a loathsome crime if committed by an individual is pardonable when committed by a state. But these are the rewards of maturity, to be enjoyed only as we decline.  

We are an adaptable species and this adaptability has enabled us to survive. However, adaptability can also constitute a threat; we may become habituated to certain dangers and fail to recognise them until its too late. Nuclear armaments are the most conspicuous example; as you read this you are in effect wearing a military uniform and sitting in a very exposed trench. You exist at the whim of people whose power does not derive from your own consent and who regard you as expendable, disposable. You merely failed to notice the moment at which you were conscripted. A normal life consists in living as if this most salient of facts was not a fact at all.  

Try your hardest to combat atrophy and routine. To question The Obvious and the given is an essential element of the maxim de omnius dubitandum.  

I have met many brave men and women, morally superior to myself, whose courage in adversity derives from their faith. But whenever they have chosen to speak or write about it, I have found myself appalled by the instant decline of their intellectual and moral standards. They want god on their side and believe they are doing his workwhat is this, even at its very best, but an extreme form of solipsism? They proceed from conclusion to evidence; our greatest resource is the mind, and the mind is not well-trained by being taught to assume what has to be proved.  

A true believer must believe that he or she is here for a purpose and is an object of real interest to a Supreme Being; he or she must also claim to have at least an inkling of what that Supreme Being desires. I have been called arrogant myself in my time, and hope to earn the title again, but to claim that I am privy to the secrets of the universe and its creatorthats beyond my conceit.  

Fulke Grevilles unforgettable line, Created sickCommanded to be well.  

And there are totalitarian insinuations to back this up if its appeal should fail. Christians, for example, declare me redeemed by a human sacrifice that occurred thousands of years before I was born. I didnt ask for it, and would willingly have foregone it, but there it is: Im claimed and saved whether I wish it or not. And if I refuse the unsolicited gift? Well, there are still some vague mutterings about an eternity of torment for my ingratitude. This is somewhat worse than a Big Brother state, because there could be no hope of its eventually passing away.  

In any case, I find something repulsive in the idea of vicarious redemption. I would not throw my numberless sins onto a scapegoat and expect them to pass from me; we rightly sneer at the barbaric societies that practice this unpleasantness in its literal form. Theres no moral value in the vicarious gesture anyway. As Thomas Paine pointed out, you may if you wish take on another mans debt, or even offer to take his place in prison. That would be self-sacrificing. But you may not assume his actual crimes as if they were your own; for one thing you did not commit them and might have died rather than do so; for another this impossible action would rob him of individual responsibility. So the whole apparatus of absolution and forgiveness strikes me as positively immoral, while the concept of revealed truth degrades the whole concept of the free intelligence by purportedly relieving us of the hard task of working out ethical principles for ourselves.  

You can see the same immorality or amorality in the Christian view of guilt and punishment. There are only two texts, both of them extreme and mutually contradictory. The Old Testament injunction is the one to exact an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth (it occurs in a passage of perfectly demented detail about the exact rules governing mutual ox-goring; you should look it up in its context). The second is from the Gospels and says that only those without sin should cast the first stone. The first is the moral basis for capital punishment and other barbarities; the second is so relativist and non judgmental that it would not allow the prosecution of Charles Manson. Our few notions of justice have had to evolve despite these absurd codes of ultravindictiveness and ultracompassion.  

However, along with Islam and Christianity it does insist that some turgid and contradictory and sometimes evil and mad texts, obviously written by fairly unexceptional humans, are in fact the word of god. I think that the indispensable condition of any intellectual liberty is the realisation that there is no such thing.  

Just to spice things up, some religions promise a good deal of carnal bliss and I think I have already mentioned one of the Church fathers, Tertullian, who also dangled the tempting option of viewing the torments of the damned. All this proves is that religion is man-made, and that men have created gods in their own image rather than the other way about. Only a humorless tyrant could want a perpetual chanting of the praises that, one has no choice but to assume, would be of the innate virtues and splendors furnished him by his creator, infinite regression, drowned in praise!  

Sigmund Freud was surely right when he concluded that religious superstition is ineradicable, at least for as long as we fear death and fear the darkness. It belongs to the childhood of our race, and childhood is not alwaysas Freud also helped us to understandour most attractive or innocent period.  

However, those who persecute religion are to be avoided at all costs.  

What I propose to you is a permanent engagement with those who think they possess what cannot be possessed. Time spent in arguing with the faithful is, oddly enough, almost never wasted. The argument is the origin of all arguments; one must always be striving to deepen and refine it; Marx was right when he stated in 1844 that the criticism of religion is the premise of all criticism.  

I should not even attempt to sermonise, yet I do warn you that if you feel capable of going into internal exile and living against the stream, you can expect some dark nights ofall rightthe soul. But to undertake this and then to seek external or invisible aid would surely be to miss the point. A degree of solitude and resignation is necessary to begin with. Some people cant bear solitude, let alone the idea that the heavens are empty and that we do not even succeed in troubling their deafness with our bootless cries. To be an exile or outcast on a remote shoremany minds turn away in terror and seek any source of cosiness. I can only say that, not only when it is compared to the ghastliness of Eternal Paternalism, the concept of loneliness and exile and self-sufficiency continually bucks me up. (And one might also, when confronted with this unadorned reality, learn to treat ones fellow exiles with more consideration and respect. But lets not ask for the moon.)  

An old definition of a gentleman: someone who is never rude except on purpose.  

**Public Opinion   Polling**  

Nowadays, public opinion is more smoothly and easily ventriloquised. I am sure you have had the experience of making up your own mind on a question and then discovering, on the evening news of the same day, that only 23.6 percent of people agree with you. 

Ought you to be depressed or disconcerted by this alarmingly exact dissection of the collective brain? Only if you believe that a squadron of undertalented but overpaid pseudo-scientists have truly and verifiably arrived at this conclusion. And perhapsindeed I would argue, in any casenot even then. 

I am sure that you are partially armored, as most intelligent people are, against this kind of thing. Everybody knows that the question can be loaded; everybody knows that the sample can be weighted; everbody knows that the intelligibility of the questions depends upon the commonplace and the regnant assumptions. Its a mark of sophistication to understand these things, and occasionally to announce that one distrusts or suspects them. 

However, these reservations dont amount to a serious critique. The first thing to notice, surely, is that these voyages into the ocean of the public mind are chartered and commissioned by wealthy and powerful organisations, who do not waste their money satisfying mere curiosity. The tactics are the same as those of market research; the point is not to interpret the world but to change it. A tendency to favor one product over another is something not to be passively discovered and observed but to be nurtured, encouraged and exploited. 

Thus to the consumer the polla suggestive word, by the way, and derived from the old and retrogressive head count taxmay seem like a mirror of existing opinion. But to the one who produces it, the poll is a swift photograph of the raw material to be worked upon. You may have noticed that popular opinion is not always and invariably cited by the elites. Nor is it consistently tested: I dont remember reading the findings of any poll about the tight money policy of the Federal Reserve. Who would pay (a properly sampled poll is quite an expensive business) for such a thing? No, public opinion is not usually recycled until it has been treated. Only then are people informed whether or not their own opinion enjoys the certification of being the majority or approved one. Even general elections, which are supposed to involve voting in the active voice rather than the passive one, have been increasingly compromised by passive dress rehearsals: the polls condition the poll.  

**I never met an actual living, breathing individual who had been consulted by a polling organisation**  

One must avoid snobbery and misanthropy. But one must also be unafraid to criticise those who reach for the lowest common denominator, and who sometimes succeed in finding it.  

My dear friend Ian McEwan, in his novel The Child in Time, describes a man so demoralised by tragedy and loss that he is reduced to gaping at daytime TV game shows. Seeing his fellow creatures so eager to humiliate and embarrass themselves, he evolves a name for watching the proceedings and calls it the democrats pornography. Let us then agree to judge crowds as we would individuals, and to employ no standard of criticism that we would not allow to be directed at ourselves.  

Milton Friedman might be wrong about sweat-shops and free-market opportunities, but he was not wrong to state that one man plus a correct opinion outvotes a majority.  

One is sometimes asked by what right one presumes to offer judgement. Quo warranto? is a very old and very justified question. But the right and warrant of an individual critic does not need to be demonstrated in the same way as that of a holder of power. It is in most ways its own justification. That is why so many irritating dissidents have been described by their enemies as selfappointed. (Once again, you see, the surreptitious suggestion of elitism and arrogance.) Self-appointed suits me fine. Nobody asked me to do this and it would not be the same thing I do if they had asked me. I cant be fired any more than I can be promoted. I am happy in the ranks of the self-employed. If I am stupid or on poor form, nobody suffers but me. To the question, Who do you think you are? I can return the calm response: Who wants to know?  

One last straddle of my high horse, then (a beast which, as Gore Vidal once said, one must keep tethered conveniently within reach). I offered to tell you in another time and place about my relations with old Karl Marx, and I notice you have not yet taken me up on it. But Ive always found it both fascinating and distressing that one of his best-known sayings is not one of his sayings at all. He did not say, and more to the point he did not believe, that religion was the opium of the people. What he did say, in his Contribution to the Critique of Hegels Philosophy of Right, was this: Religious distress is at the same time the expression of real distress and the protest against real distress. Religion is the sign of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is required for their real happiness. The demand to give up the illusions about its condition is the demand to give up a condition that needs illusions. The criticism of religion is therefore in embryo the criticism of the vale of woe, the halo of which is religion. Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers from the chain not so that man will wear the chain without any fantasy or consolation but so that he will shake off the chain and cull the living flower. You will notice the difference between these rather splendidly nuanced sentences and their consistent, unvarying one-sided vulgarisation.  

One must have the nerve to assert that, while people are entitled to their illusions, they are not entitled to a limitless enjoyment of them and they are not entitled to impose them upon others.  

Allow a friend to believe in a bogus prospectus or a false promise and you cease, after a short while, to be a friend at all. How dare you intervene? As well ask, How dare you not? Are you so sure you know better? Ask yourself this question a thousand times, but if you are sure, have the confidence and dignity to say so. Remember that saying nothing is also a decision, and that the relativists and the nonjudgmental have made up their minds just as much, if not as firmly. This is simply another way of reminding you that, if you decide to pass judgements and make criticisms and take forward positions, you both can and should expect a few hearings to convene on yourself. A welcome prospect, I trust. It certainly helps prevent the art and science of disputation from dying out amongst us.  

Noam Chomsky, a most distinguished intellectual and moral dissident, once wrote that the old motto about speaking truth to power is overrated. Power, as he points out, quite probably knows the truth already, and is mainly interested in suppressing or limiting or distorting it. We would therefore do better to try to instruct the powerless. I am not sure that there is a real difference in this distinction. Ruthless and arrogant though power can appear, it is only ever held by mere mammals who excrete and yearn, and who suffer from insomnia and insecurity. These mammals are also necessarily vain in the extreme, and often wish to be liked almost as much as they desire to be feared.  

One of the finest moments in our history occurred when Nelson Mandela was visited by the authorities who had kept him in confinement for a quarter of a century. They had been shaken by international condemnation and also by a general rising of the oppressed. The name of Mandela, which was supposed to have been buried by a long and harsh immurement, was on every lip. All right, they nervously said to him, you can go now. Youre a free man. His reply wasI am not leaving. You do not have the power to release me, least of all to release me to gratify yourselves. I shall not leave this cell until I hear that everybody else has been released, and that all the laws of the tyranny have been stricken from the books. At that moment, it was clear who held the keys. (Up until that moment, every sort of pseudo-diplomatic compromise had been proposed to allow the racist usurpers to keep at least some part of their spoil, and to save some part of their face.)

We found a home for it and are waiting on a friend of ours to pick it up soon.

<TEXT> Eddie's game plan seemed to be to go for McGregor's front leg which I actually do think is a weak spot of his. Nate caught him a few times there and he couldn't defend it too well, or as well as would be expected. Eddie caught him twice and it worked out well for him, but once Conor checked Alvarez the plan seemed to go out the window and he was like a deer in headlights. He was done. Amazing performance. Conor made it look so fucking easy, and it's not easy against Alvarez. I think this was more impressive than the Aldo KO honestly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I say "book" because it's simply three talks/lectures with a questions   answers section at the end of each talk, so from a literature perspective it's not complex at all. It's actually a really easy to understand, dumbed version if you will, comparatively speaking anyways.  

That's appropriate too, because Paine wrote in that manner, as did Orwell to an extent.  

I've seen each of the talks a few times but it's nice to have them in written form. I was actually considering putting them into writing myself so this saves the time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From Hitchens:

It is perhaps a testimony to the state of affairs in France at that date that Paine did not even have access to a bible when he was composing Part One of The Age of Reason. But he knew the book well enough by heart to make very few mistakes, and was able to continue revising the work in this way while he lay in his dank cell. Upon his release, he was taken in by Ambassador James Monroe and his wife, and in their home was furnished with a bible. Part Two was finished by October 1795. It is somewhat arresting to think of a book being begun by candlelight by a hunted dissident, then updated from memory in a death cell, and finally completed in the home of a distinguished future president of the United States. </TEXT>

<TITLE> In a time when "The New World" was deeply influenced by religion, Thomas Paine was a beacon of reason. He was the first to do many things, such as demand justice for women, highlight animal cruelty, urge independence for slaves. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-27 14:35:11 </DATE>

<TEXT> Thomas Paine was: 

The first to urge extension of the principles of independence to the enslaved negro; the first to arraign monarchy; and to point out the danger of its survival in presidency; the first to propose articles of a more thorough nationality to the new-born States; the first to advocate international arbitration; the first to expose the absurdity and criminality of duelling; the first to suggest more rational ideals of marriage and divorce; the first to advocate national and international copyright; the first to plead for the animals; the first to demand justice for women   

Source: https://books.google.com/books?id=Ja4FAAAAMAAJ pg=PA47 lpg=PA47 dq=thomas+paine+was+the+first+to+demand+justice+for+women source=bl ots=l0jNePvVlJ sig=Azzes1g-5aqzSJxByIi2ZQAW3wo hl=en sa=X sqi=2 ved=0ahUKEwic4qOR_vrPAhWCez4KHXMfCRAQ6AEIJzAD#v=onepage q f=false

At the time, women were deeply subjugated because of the contents of the bible, and men often had several wives. Slavery was rampant, and he highlighted the hypocrisy of christians that owned slaves as their bible said they should treat their neighbour as themselves.  

Where would we be without this man? I shudder to think. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I've stopped using my driver. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-22 03:47:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I suppose I should preface this with the following: My grandfather was a scratch golfer and he used a 3 iron off the tee. He didn't even have a driver.  

As a bit of an experiment, and as it turns out for good reason, I stopped using my driver recently on my local course. The course really only has a few holes that are what I would call driver-worthy, but prior to getting the M2 I used to use my driver on most par 4s and all par 5s. 

I recently switched from SLDR to M2 (irons and woods), and this added quite a bit of distance. I'm not hitting the driver as well as I would like though. Initially I was hitting it great, but over time I'll screw up a drive every couple of rounds, and it can end up ruining the round for me. It's just not as consistent as I would like, and I'm probably only hitting it as far as my 3 wood from the tee. 

My 3 wood, is something I can hit perfectly every time so it makes sense to just go with that for now. With the SLDR I was lucky if I could hit my 3 wood 210 - 220 from the tee. With the M2 I'm reaching 230 - 250. My driver is going around 250 - 260. It should be going further but I just haven't mastered it yet, and at this point I'm wondering if I'll ever even bother with it. 

Anyone else ditched the driver?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dude I was just wondering how you were doing! Blow up holes happen us all I wouldn't worry about it too much, it's just important to try to learn from them. It doesn't matter if your Jordan freaking Spieth haha. That's a great putting man honestly. Very nicely done.  

I played 18 today after work and shot a 71. It could have been in the 60s but I blew up on a hole as well. My back was aching me towards the end of the round (I have arthritis), it happens. I played with a member that joined the club and we played match play the whole round which was a lot of fun. I need to find some golfing buddies haha. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was brilliant. The "talk" lasted around two hours, was very engaging and funny, packed with loads of info. Neil reviewed the physics in a lot of mainstream movies, talking about what they got right and wrong. It was actually a very good way to connect with the crowd, and to teach science.  

There were some younger members in the audience that he really connected with as well. He did a little Q A at the end as well.  

My favourite part of the night was when he talked about being at the premiere for Contact in the 90s, and the scene where Jodie Foster tries to explain the Drake Equation but she gets the math horribly wrong. Tyson was sitting a couple of rows behind Drake who was also at the movie. He tried to get Drake's attention, and when he finally did Drake said "It's just a movie Tyson, relax." The way he told this story was hilarious.  

Overall a fantastic experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great thread, with some really solid advice. If I can offer my own experience:  

I was a 7 handicap when I played in my teens, and I gave it up 16 years ago. I played two rounds last year, and then got serious about golf in May of this year. My first round this year I shot 100, and was given a handicap of 30. It's been a quick and steady improvement since then. I managed to get out 3 or 4 times a week, while also hitting a few hundred to maybe a thousand balls at the range. That was a very good week. My wife had surgery recently so I haven't been out as much, but I everything clicked recently so I'll continue.  

For me, I had to find my old swing first. This took a lot longer than I had thought it would, and at this point my swing is completely rebuilt.... but before even shooting that round of 100 I was at the range for six weeks or so, hitting shanks and mishits galore until I started to feel semi-comfortable. I was still doing loads wrong, but I could see improvements and that's all I was looking for.  

Once I shot 100, I joined a club in NC that gives me access to 3 courses. Each is pretty unique, and none of them are starter/beginner level courses. They're all pretty difficult for different reasons, and honestly I solely believe that my progress is a direct result to each course's layout. It made me a better golfer.  

Once I joined I had a lesson, and a lot of easy fixes were applied. My grip wasn't as strong as it should be, my ball position was off, my tempo was off. By the end of June I was scoring in the 80s consistently. Every now and again I'd catch one heavy, but my swing was developing fairly well. 

Then disaster happened. I've no idea why but I didn't play for two weeks due to work and when I returned I just couldn't hit the ball anymore. Everything was slicing, even my bloody 60 degree lob wedge. Back for lessons and I was all over the place. My swing coach is one of the top 40 in the states, a great guy, and he really helped. With a lot of work, my natural shot now is a push right to left draw.  

By the end of July/start of August I was reaching into the 70s. I wasn't that consistent, I'd shoot 78 then a 95 the next time out. A lot of this was mental. I seemed to play so much better on my own than with people, because of nerves or whatever. Stage fright. It's odd I could go out with my swing coach and shoot in the 70s but if I was playing with other members it was a different story.  

I was off from August 19th to September 5th. My mother was visiting and I played every second day, and when I wasn't at the course I was at the range. Lots of iron practice, chipping, putting. I bought a new Scotty Cameron putter which changed my short game. I had a round where I three putted six times and I swore I would never use the putter again. I got the Scotty on eBay for 157 - an absolute bargain as it was brand new. I got it cut, and had weight added to it. It's one of my favourite clubs now.  

Recently I traded in my SLDR irons and woods for M2 irons and woods. I'm a low handicap now, and while the M2 irons are for higher handicap players I find them fantastic. I took 0.75" off the length, added weight so they went from C5 to D4. I did all of this myself. My swing coach thought I was nuts when we met, and he was kinda pissed a bit too because he thought it would ruin my game - I was hitting my irons fine, but I knew something just didn't feel right. I wasn't striking them as well as I would have liked. Every now and again I'd catch one heavy. Something just felt off. I'm only 5ft4 and I was convinced it was because of this.... and it turns out I was right. 

It took a few weeks to get used to the new irons but the change is insane. I played 9 holes yesterday evening after work and shot 34. I didn't have one bad shot, every shot was executed exactly how I planned it. I'm currently a 0.5 handicap and should be scratch or better soon. My aim is to play in the US Open qualifiers next year.  

In summary:  

1. Come up with a plan for when you're at the range. Look at what the professionals do when warming up before their rounds, and copy them. Do the same drills. This is extremely important. I can't play a round properly without doing this beforehand.  

2. Until you develop your swing, spend most of your time practicing irons. Do some chipping and putting too, but you need to develop your swing first. Once your swing is developed, change the focus onto your short game because that is where you'll be able to take shots off your score quickly. I spoke with Graeme McDowell about this. His advice for me was to get better from inside 100 yards. I was a 6 handicap when we spoke. He was right. I hadn't been focusing on this area enough. Now I spend about 30% on iron/woods, the rest chipping and putting. 

3. Come up with a pre-shot routine. This helps focus the mind. You'll get out of your head if you do this. I got this advice from the book Golf is not a Game of Perfect. It has really helped me. I look at where my ball is. I plan my shot - something that's equally as important. Then I go do my routine and hit it. Before this I'd get in my head and fluff shots quite a bit.  

4. Don't beat yourself up. If I play a bad shot I often laugh it off. It doesn't get me down. Bad shots are part of the game. Show me a professional that doesn't hit a bad shot. There's a reel of shanks from the Web.com and PGA Tour professionals on YouTube. Everyone does it. The PGATOUR often post "golf is hard" posts on Twitter, with golfers missing 1 foot putts, etc.  

5. Get golfballs from lostgolfballs - they're on Amazon. I picked up 250 balls for like 120 bucks. It's a bargain and when you're losing golf balls you'll need to save some cash. Believe me.  

6. Try out different courses. This will help you develop your game.  

7. Enjoy yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just had that feeling now haha. Went round 2 under on the front 9 at my home course after work today. On the par 4 7th, I laid up with my 5 wood off the tee. Left me with 87 yards (the hole is around 290), my approach shot my with approach wedge, 3/4 swing, stuck it to the pin. Took a lovely divot. It was perfect. Felt amazing. If only it was that easy every time haha. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure how much advice I can give. I'm married and I try to play every weekend, although work sometimes gets in the way. I did play quite a bit in July/August but slackened off some now. I plan my golf outings two weeks in advance so we don't run into issues. My wife has been confined to the house for the last six weeks so I haven't really golfed too much during that time. She's recovering from surgery but is back to work this week.  

All I can say is plan your outings and if you say you'll be x hours don't be x+2 hours if you can help it. I'd love to be at the course every single day after work but that just can't happen realistically.  

My new plan is to go on Fridays after work and go again on Sunday, giving us all day Saturday together.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just came off on call for work where I had a 15 minute response time so didn't get out for nearly 3 weeks leading up to last weeken(which was hurricane Matthew weekend), so any rhythm I had is gone. Played yesterday, took me 11 holes to get going. Not the best time, but I will be back into it again soon. It's crazy how quick I lose "the touch", and I go on call every 12 weeks too so this is something I need to come up with a plan to address.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nice. That's pretty sweet. I was catching my 4 iron heavy every now and again, but hitting the rest fine.... but I took off 0.75 inches and I'm still getting used to the difference honestly. Every 4th or 5th shot I'll catch thin, but holy fuck I'm hitting them further now which is really surprising. I took the length off and added more weight. My 7 iron is going around 15 yards further than it was before the change..... but yeah I'm in transition now and just need to get used to it. </TEXT>

It almost feels like cheating sometimes. The thing only cost me 80 bucks and it's one of the best investments I've ever made. If only my other clubs were as reliable.

<TEXT> I'm sorry for your loss. It must be absolutely tragic for all involved. I'm glad your wife isn't blaming herself for some bullshit sleight against an imaginary god. Religion can be a sickness like that. "What have I done to upset our god enough to take our child?"... thinking like that is cancerous of the mind.  

I recently perused the story of a man that lived on The Blasket Islands off the coast of Ireland. People don't live there anymore, and he wanted to tell his tale in pen form so his story was recorded and their way of life wasn't lost forever. Such hardships, crazy poverty and the daily struggle of just trying to exist. He got his first shoes on his wedding day, to give one example. Another example is that he and his wife had 11 children, and every one of them died. Be it from famine, illness or simply an accident. One of his daughters was playing by the edge of a cliff and a bird flew into her and knocked her off. She died in front of him.  

What I mean to say is, we live like kings in comparison to the hardships that people had to go through, but the loss of a child is something that is universal. Whether it's one child, or eleven, it's something that can't be forgotten and something that will take a very long time to get through. You'll never get over it, but you'll learn to live with it in time. Be there for your wife. Don't let the loss of your child create distance between the two of you. It's OK to be sad. Be sad together. I wish you well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a huge issue, and is something I was made aware of in my teens when a fella in my school killed themselves. I'm 33 now, so it was a good while ago at this stage. Almost 20 years. He threw himself off the Cliffs of Moher, which has become a fairly common practice.

A friend of mine volunteers with Bunratty Search   Rescue, and whenever I'm home (in the states currently) I go out on the boats with them. They've saved quite a few lads over the years so this statistic could be a hell of a lot higher. The amount of people throwing themselves into the shannon river in Limerick, and all along the river bank there is on the rise as well. 

Since yer man threw himself off the cliffs, I can name close to ten people I know who've done this over the years, and I'm from a tiny town with 9,000 people living there like. It's brutal. Mostly men too although there was a couple of girls that did it too. I won't name names or provide links here because some of the families still don't want it known that it was suicide, all these years later. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 2016 October Book Discussion: Arguably: Essays by Christopher Hitchens Part 3: Amusements, Annoyances   Disappointments </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-08 20:04:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Part 3 of Arguably starts on page 389 with the 'controversial' essay "Why Women Aren't Funny", an essay taken out of context by folks that didn't bother to read or understand it and tried to paint Hitchens as a misogynist when in fact he is a champion of women often stating the only true cure for poverty is the empowerment of women.  

One of my favourite essays from this part of the volume is probably the one on Victor Klemperer. It lead me to picking up a copy of his diaries, and also writing an essay (as yet unpublished) on Victor's life under the Nazi regime. 

Enjoy folks. Apologies again for the delay.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a Trump supporter at all. I'm considering moving back to the EU if he's elected.... but I have to say this:

I see a lot of hypocritical shit here, and online. Bill Clinton raped Juanita Broderick in the 70s. Christopher Hitchens documented this in his book No One Left to Lie To. I've spoke with Juanita about the incident as well. Hitchens makes the claim that there's two other women. Bill bit the face of Juanita when he pinned her down before raping her. Bit her cheek.  

Juanita told me that Hillary came after her, threatened her. She claims the secret service killed her dog and sent threats to her. She lived in fear and still does.

Now, Juanita is a big pro Trump supporter, which I am not. So we don't see eye to eye politically, religiously (I'm atheist), so this isn't some pro-Trump bias.  

Hillary supporters going after Trump over his 'grab her by the pussy' comments is ridiculously hypocritical. I'm not saying Trump shouldn't be roasted over this - he should resign and this should have come a long time ago.... BUT Pence is a thousand times worse than Trump. And that fucking terrifies me.

Pence, Trump, Hillary. THEY ARE ALL FUCKING AWFUL. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chipping and putting did it for me. And being consistent off the tee. On my lowest rounds of 70, 71, 72, 74 I hit every fairway, and never putt more than twice. When I needed to get down in two (if my approach shot missed the green so I didn't hit the green in regulation) I got down in two, with a good chip and a putt.  

Your short game is key, but it's also very important to be in a good place from your initial drive as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When the Ryder Cup was in Europe, fans cheered and clapped as American players were teeing off or taking shots. It was white noise. There wasn't shouts of "YOU MARRIED YOUR FATHER" or "Suck a dick!" or "YOU'RE GOING TO MISS!" when players were standing over a ball.  

You can't equate the two honestly, either. What we've seen the last few days is being caused by roughly 0.10% of the 50,000 there (50 folks or so). 

It sucks that the US players are having to police the crowd. It sucks that the commentators are focusing on it as well. On Sky Sports you don't hear it as much as the volume from the crowd microphones are lowered way down. Maybe that's what should happen in the future? Mute the microphones before/after a shot and only allow us to hear the club being swung. Maybe feed us a 10 - 15 second delayed feed so crap can be removed?  

This is the unfortunate result of golf becoming popular in a country currently going through nationalistic rise with Trumpets feeling emboldened and racism on the rise as well.

<TEXT> He said the cheers from the pro-Nick Faldo gallery when Azinger landed in the sand on No. 18 didn't bother him. It was so un-golf-like a reaction from the crowd that tournament chairman Alister Low publicly rebuked the fans afterwards, saying, "I'm sorry about the unsporting reception that Paul Azinger received at the second shot on the 18th hole."

Nobody here is complaining about this. Show me the fan that shouted "YOU MARRIED YOUR FATHER" at him. Show me the fan that shouted MISS before he took his shot, or during it.

Both sets of fans seem to be cheering when someone misses. That's not what the gripe is here. We are all annoyed at the behaviour when a player is about to take a shot, or is lining up for his shot. 

Big difference between that and people cheering when a ball goes in the sand. </TEXT>

It's one of my favourite times of year. Unfortunately I'm on call this weekend, 9am to 9pm but I'll be up at 6am to get some golf in and then settle into the Ryder Cup when I get home. It's such an exciting time. I wish it was four days instead of three!

<TITLE> How hard would it be to build a 'smart' golf ball? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-28 03:36:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm talking about a ball that would record stats from every shot. Things like:

1. Air Pressure.  
2. Spin Rate.  
3. Velocity Info (speed, height, path, etc)  

It would also allow a person to find the ball if it went into the rough and so on. The device in side it would have to be charged wirelessly too.

I've found some patents on this so I'm not even sure if someone is allowed to make this sort of device now. Here's one of several patents: https://www.google.com/patents/US20150094168  

I'm a software developer, but I'm useless when it comes to hardware and I've no idea about the current state of GPS and RFID technology. I am a golfer so I have an interest in this. It would obviously be very important to have a good ball, so leaving a pocket inside the ball must not impact performance.  

It's also very important to note that ball manufacturers are not really interested in this because if people stop losing balls then their profits disappear. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hitchens was ruthless, and I love it. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-14 03:14:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm currently reading through old essays and reviews from Hitchens in the Times Literary Supplement from the 1990s.

In 1998 he reviewed a book by Arthur Marwick - "The Sixties".  He really laid into Marwick, and as expected he didn't hold back. From the essay:

Paul Johnson, even at the time, would have had a legitimate quarrel with Marwicks account of a subculture which included the older left-wing journals (such as New Statesman, Tribune, and Left Review), the underground papers, experimental theatre, and the new radical Marxist journal founded by Tariq Ali, appearing on 15 May 1968, Black Dwarf. There are also several minor but suggestive factual errors in that extract, which Perry Anderson and Tariq Ali would spot like hawks. I mention this because, in considering a period where so many of the protagonists are still (to say the least) alive, it is derelict of Marwick to have made so little effort to find and question them. As against that, I grew weary of the American letters he repeatedly cited from some personal friends named Van Dyke, as if these were some trove from a lost antiquity.

In the end, this is in the truest sense an eccentric book: made up of the musings and fossickings of a graduate of the university of life. He is free to follow his nose, to pursue his interests, and to vent his (call me old-fashioned if you will) prejudices. It doesnt much matter if he doesnt know his Bukharin from his Bakunin, unless you care that the 1960s were the last decade of hot ideological disputation. (Cultural Revolution, in those days, was a fighting term and not one to be lightly deployed.)

Anyway, here is Marwick's response:


Sir,  Christopher Hitchenss unremitting rant (November 13) against my book, The Sixties: Cultural revolution in Britain, France, Italy and the United States, c.1958-c.1974, was so manifestly insane that a response is scarcely necessary. However, since he has blatantly abused the trust of your readers, I must record a few corrections.  
Flaunting his unfailing gift for tediously unoriginal quotation, Hitchens declares my book a pudding with no theme. It has several. The main one, evidently the root of the Hitchens hysteria, concerns what I term the Great Marxisant Fallacy which befuddled the protesters of the time as it has befuddled commentators since. There was never any possibility of revolution, though; as society was permeated (another central theme) by new ideas, the lives of ordinary people were transformed (my cultural revolution, another central theme). I identify sixteen characteristics of a unique era upon whose complex interrelationships the book is meticulously structured. Hitchens encloses certain words and phrases, for example strides  as in the pathetic cliche strides forward  and call me old fashioned if you like, implying that they are quotations from my book. In fact, they are as spurious as everything else in this review.  
The Sixties is based on ten years research in the archives of four countries.  
But, since Hitchens thinks he knows it all already, he wraps himself in the age-old reaction of the ideologue: Dont confuse me with the evidence. In a meretricious list of alleged errors, he accuses me of mistaking Bukharin for Bakunin. Actually, neither are mentioned by me; it would indeed be an eccentric book on the 1960s if I did.  
Lets face it: Christopher Hitchens is upset that I spurn the idols of his youth and challenge the familiar, comfy lefty myths. Regrettably, he does not have the integrity to say so straight-forwardly. Declaring that things we dont like dont exist is the ploy of a Stalinist moron; and if you cant ban a book, swamp it in mindless abuse.

And here is Hitchens response:

Sir,  In my review of The Sixties by Arthur Marwick (November 13), I believe I drew attention to Marwicks difficulty in making distinctions. To this point he adds emphasis by his letter (December 18). There is, first, the distinction between a wounded letter and a wounding one. To abuse me as manifestly insane and a Stalinist moron is to display ugly wounds on his side without inflicting any on mine. There is, next, the distinction between an instance and a metaphor. I did say that Marwick didnt know his Bakunin from his Bukharin. I didnt allege, as he expostulates, that he cited either name. But his indignance on this point is misdirected. The terms arse and elbow are likewise absent from his text. I merely meant to say that he would probably have let that distinction elude him also


As I said, ruthless.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi folks,

I bought a yearly subscription to the Times Literary Supplement today. It's $185 which includes everything; hard copy to my house along with digital access to the archive going back to the early 90s. If you *just* want the digital access it's considerably cheaper: $115.  

Anyways - there's a lot of Hitchens content on there. He published lots of book reviews, polemics, etc. There's also some forward-and-back between him and people who responded to his essays.  

A lot of the content there is not in his published books: Arguably, And Yet, etc.  

I figured I'd let you lads know just in case you wanted more Hitchens content and didn't know where to look.  

Additional to the Hitchens content is everything else obviously. I think it's a steal for this price. If anyone has a subscription feel free to talk about his essays here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm reading a few books at the moment, but getting bored by them so I decided to pick up Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis. I've read this book three times now since first reading it less than a year ago. I just can't get enough of it. It's just *so* funny.  

I am always reading Lord of the Rings as well. I'll pick it up, go through 300 pages, and not touch it again for a few months and continue on the story.  

I'm also always reading something by John Moriarty - currently working my way through his last book: Nostos continued.  

For me, Lucky Jim is one of my favourite books. I can't believe it took me 32 years to find it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wrote a little about this a few days ago, but it is something that is plaguing me and I'd like to open up the discussion. 

I've been suffering with playing consistently. There's some days I show up and I just can't swing properly. Here's a list of my scores since May 30th:  

Date|Score|CR/Slope|Diff|Course  
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|  
8/31/16|74|72.1/138|1.6|Preserve at Jordan Lake GC

7/2/16|82|71.6/135|8.7|Preserve at Jordan Lake GC / P  
6/25/16|77|70.0/128|6.2|Preserve at Jordan Lake GC
6/24/16|78|70.0/126|7.2|Preserve at Jordan Lake GC / P  
6/18/16|78|70.0/128|7.1|Preserve at Jordan Lake GC  
6/15/16|82|70.0/126|10.8|Preserve at Jordan Lake GC / P  
6/11/16|79|70.0/128|7.9|Preserve at Jordan Lake GC  
6/4/16|82|70.2/128|10.4|Grande Dunes Resort Club  
6/3/16|89|70.8/131|15.7|TPC of Myrtle Beach  
5/30/16|96|70.0/128|23.0|Preserve at Jordan Lake GC  

As you can see the scores are trending in the right direction, but every so often I show up and just can't swing a club. I have no explanation for it. On the 29th I played from the whites and went around level par. My swing felt so smooth, the best it has ever been really. The next day I was absolutely brutal. The 87 could have easily been 117. I just couldn't swing properly. Today my swing felt amazing again and I played from the blue tees and was +2 at the end of the round.  

I just don't get it. The inconsistency is driving me crazy. I'm meeting with my swing coach on Friday to go over a few things and see if we can figure out what is going on. 

Up until now I've been writing it off as an off day, but it's something else. It seems to happen every so often. I have arthritis and I'm wondering if it has something to do with it. Maybe I'm not doing enough stretching.  

Anyone else suffering from inconsistent form? Were you able to figure out what's causing it? </TEXT>

Asides from playing early morning, is there anything else I should be doing to take advantage of being off? I plan on getting fit for my irons   woods on this coming Friday. I suppose I should schedule a few lessons as well. I was thinking of maybe heading to Pinehurst to stay there for one night and play No. 2 at some point. Are there any other clubs or courses I should be checking out?

The range was closed on my local course today for maintenance so I wasn't able to do my usual 40 minute warm up routine. 

It took me 14 holes to find my swing and start playing to my usual standard. I three putted, had horrible drives, left approach shots short. The works. All the way up to hole 14.

From hole 15 through 18 I was 1 under and my swing was so smooth and what I expect after I have gone through my warm up routine.  

Honestly though, I'm a bit pissed off it took so long to get going. I would have hoped, or thought it would only take a few holes to get going. Perhaps it was just an off day. 

Do you lads have a warm up routine? How bad are you if you can't do it before a round? </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are your thoughts on the hijab and other religious garments which force women to cover themselves up? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-26 18:07:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For me, it's a human rights issue. Islam directly translated means submission. Submission to god and submission to ones husband. I think we have all seen the photos of Iranian society in the early to mid 1900s where women were not covered and resembled western society. 

Islam treats women as second class citizens, as does Christianity. The bible states that a woman cannot have a position of power over a man. Both religions subjugate women, and both are responsible for the appalling treatment of women for centuries. It's not too long ago since women in Ireland couldn't vote and weren't allowed in bars. When women were finally allowed in bars they were confined to a "snug"... Essentially a booth or tiny room... This is because of religion.

Forcing women to cover themselves up because the men get a bit rapey is a disastrous human rights problem. I think secular societies should ban the hijab, burka, et all. Islam needs reformation. It's not the only offender. Nuns, Orthodox Jews, and so on. 

What are your thoughts on this? How should a secular society handle this? When Iran banned the hijab in the 1930s lots of women killed themselves because their husbands wouldn't let them out of the house, so it's not as easy as just banning the garment. It's a complex issue but ultimately Islam needs reformation. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Bukowski. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-19 16:28:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know I'm late to the party. Bukowski was recommended to me a few years ago and I started reading **Ham on Rye** back then but stopped around a third of the way through because something came up. I'm not even sure what it was now that stopped me. I continued reading other books but I think I just needed history at the time and didn't want any more novels for a bit. You know how that goes I am sure.  

This week I read **The Post Office** in a day. A few hours actually, cover to cover without putting it down. I didn't even stop to piss. The style of writing is deceiving. He makes it look so easy, but it's not at all. Hilariously funny. I'm reading Ham on Rye again now and I'm half way through after a day. It's equally brilliant. I plan on finishing it this evening after work. Chinaski was a funny fucker as a child and his father is such a degenerate. **Women** is up next. 

I am going on a little vacation until September 6th and I just picked up the following as well:  
1. Pulp.  
2. Hollywood.  
3. Factotum.  
4. Notes of a Dirty Old Man.  
5. On Writing.  

The next few weeks are going to be wonderful I'm sure. There's been loads of threads on Bukowski here but I just had to get this out. Thanks for listening.  </TEXT>

I want to run Arguably in sections because it's so large, so in August we will focus on the section titled **All American** which runs from the start of the book up to page 139.  

I think this breaks it up nicely.

<TEXT> Editorial errors and typos are why I ditched digital books. I was sick of them. Some books were worse than others, obviously. I like reading the classics and they were the worst offenders, sometimes every couple of pages. I got tired of reporting issues. More often than not I never even received a response and the issues are still there. 

It's been so long since I used my kindle, it won't even turn on anymore.  

**EDIT** I don't pirate books so this is an issue with books pre-kindle, which have been either typed up or scanned badly.

<TEXT> We're nearing the end of this journey, with Arguably being the last book we'll be reading next month. Arguably is huge of course and probably should go on for longer than a month.  

This month we're focusing on a short pamphlet about Iraq, a great little volume that outlines why Hitchens was in favour of regime change in Iraq. 

It's easy to spot someone who is lazy and uninformed about Hitchens   the Iraq war, because they'll drop a one liner along the lines of the following "Well Hitchens was pro Iraq War and look how that turned out. He was wrong about Iraq".

Hitchens was not wrong about Iraq. All along the way he kept arguing that the US was not doing enough, they dropped the ball at every occasion and pulled out too soon. They did a terrible job.

Anyway, enjoy the short read folks. I haven't read it in a few years and I'm really looking forward to this. </TEXT>

I'll be going home to Ireland for a month next year and I'd love to stop by in Germany again for a few days.

<TEXT> He spent a lot of the round trying to convert me, which would have normally ruined the day or me but I found the humour in it. I was able to shoot him down. He was just shooting the shit.  

He was a pure hacker and dug trenches through the whole course. He had one good hole where he got a par, and thanked THE LORD for helping him do it. Got on his knees and everything. I asked him where his Lord was for the previous holes  and it was as if the thought never crossed his mind.   

We had a lot of banter during the round, made a lot of fun out of each other, but I definitely got him thinking.   

I also showed him the sub I started, /r/pastorarrested and he was shocked. I talked about how the whole thing needs to be fucking regulated and how I was astonished that people are willing to leave their kids with these people.   

To be fair I cringed when he said he was a pastor but now I'm glad we met. It was a fun experience.    </TEXT>

<TITLE> What's your favourite book by an Irish author? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-01 15:46:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I must admit I haven't read a lot of our own literature. 

I've read **Dracula** and loved parts of it, the love letters drove me mad though I thought they kind of ruined the story. 

**The Picture of Dorian Gray** is the only work I've read from Oscar Wilde. I loved it, and made a mental note to read more from Wilde but it just hasn't happened at all.

I've read a lot of Irish History, books by Dan Breen, Ernie O'Malley,  Tom Barry, et al, so not really looking for suggestions there.  

John Moriarty was a great Irish poet and philosopher and I've read all of his works as well. 

**The Islandman** by Tomas O'Crohan was a fantastic read about life on the Blasket Islands before it was abandoned. He got his first pair of shoes the day he got married. Crazy to think how people lived a relatively short time ago.  

Are there any "must read" books I've missed out on? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-07-01 15:12:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've not actually had an issue with the driver, per se. I've hit the last 30 or so fairways with it and had two of the best rounds I've ever had but a lot of you have said it's unforgiving so I'm wondering if I would see improvements with a different driver.

Also, the crux of the issue is really that the driver I have is very lofted - 14.5 degrees which and I figure if I get a 10.5 degree or 9.5 degree driver I will gain some distance. 

I usually hit the current driver around 220 - 250.

Can anyone recommend a driver to try? Preferably one that came out from 2014 onwards. 

All of my clubs are TaylorMade but I'd have no issues getting a driver from someone else, be it Nike, Titleist, Callaway or whatever. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Funny golf stories? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-15 15:35:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So the video of the pros shanking their shots reminded me of something that happened when I was playing golf as a teen. I played golf up until I was 16 and then quit when I went to university. I just started playing again this year (I'm 32), so this happened quite a while ago but it is something I will never forget.  

I was playing a tournament in Ireland at my local course. We used to have a tournament every Thursday during the summer for youths. I must have been 14 or 15 at the time and I was paired with Fergus, a fella I knew from school and who I would golf with quite a bit.  

Fergus was known for getting the yips every now and again, and despite this he would still put up a very decent score. I think he was playing off of 12 or 14 at the time.  

We were on the second hole, a par 5 dogleg left. I hooked my ball into the woods, and he hit his perfectly straight. By some miracle my ball hit a tree and went flying forward and ended up further forward than his drive, but still in the woods.  

Anyways, I'm standing by my ball trying to figure out how the hell I'm going to get out of the woods with my next shot. Unbeknownst to me Fergus takes out his 3 wood and shanks it like you wouldn't believe. He still catches it pretty solid. I don't see any of this, as I'm still trying to figure out a way to get out of the woods.  

Suddenly my legs are taken out from under me and I'm laying face up with this killer pain in my right leg. Then I hear a shout of "four", which is bloody hilarious. 

I can't stop laughing and as I get up Fergus is running over to me with these huge "OH CRAP!" eyes on him. He drops his club half way and people behind us are wondering wtf he is doing. 

I can't even stand properly when I get up and I check under my clothes to see how bad the mark is and my leg is black where he it. Instantly black.

I wasn't able to play the rest of the tournament and Fergus didn't want me to go back because everyone would know what he did and he was worried he'd get in trouble.

It was absolutely hilarious. I felt so bad for Fergus, and I'll never forget his face when he was running towards me with those eyes.

Do you lads have any funny stories from the course?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obligatory scorecard: http://i.imgur.com/XvaNuIH.jpg

I had no idea I had beaten 80 until I got into my car and did the math while the car cooled down. I had checked the score on my front 9 at the half way point and was pleased enough but did not want to get my hopes up as I've scored 39 on the front 9 a few times and blown up on the back 9 before.

A few take aways: my irons were poor today, in a way. The distance was perfect but I pulled a lot of them left. I did not give myself enough chances for birdie. Some of this was down to how I lined up for the shot.

My chipping saved me today. I hit the pin twice with my chips and mostly left the ball within three feet or so.

My putting wasn't the best so lots of room for improvement there. Scoring 79 when 30 shots are putts is brutal enough. 

I really am absolutely delighted with my chipping today. I've been practicing it for the last two weeks and it has really payed off. 

With such a low GIR I probably didn't deserve to break 80 but as I said I owe it all to how I chipped today.

Hopefully I can get another round or two in the 70s this year. Need to continue to focus on irons, chipping and now need to put a lot more focus on putting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I count to make sure my rhythm is correct so I do some beat counting which I was taught by my pro in my last lesson, and I also ensure I keep my head down. That's literally all I am thinking about. I just trust my swing and let it do its thing. I find if I overthink things I'll catch it thin or heavy.

However, I still end up catching the ball heavy every so often when I am tired. 

Clearing my mind and just focusing on rhythm and keeping my head down has really improved my game. Is there anything else I should be focusing on or thinking about? </TEXT>

<TITLE> I had a lesson on Friday and it was brilliant. If you're considering lessons please do it. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-30 02:14:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The lesson was with one of the pros at the course I'm a member of. He's listed as a top 50 PGA professional instructor in the states. I saw him giving lessons to others at the range and I really liked how he interacted with people so figured it was worth a shot. 

Prior to the lesson every so often I'd hit a shot thin. I wanted to find the cause of this. 

After the first three shots I hit, all of them good, he was able to say he thought it was my tempo and that I was lifting my head a bit. 

He brought me out to the 150 marker on the 18th and asked me to hit 5 balls to him on the green with the club of my choice (my 7 iron). Two were good and three went a bit right into the trap. He said the good ones traveled around 135 in the air and ran up to 145 or 150.

We went back to the range and he recorded me. He completely analyzed my swing and liked what he saw for the most part. Good posture, not moving my head or lifting my feet on the back swing. He noticed me lifting my body slightly before impact and it was because I wasn't keeping my head down. 

He also counted the time I started swinging to impact and it varied quite largely.

He taught me about tempo and got me counting 123, 123 (I start lifting here) 123 I'm at the top of my swing, and then I swing and strike.

I think I'm explaining the tempo badly I need to do it visually but I digress.

I saw results instantly. We worked on this for an hour and almost every shot was perfect. When it wasn't i was lifting my head again, but tempo remained good. Not surprised by that as I play the bodhran (Irish drum). I used to have issues every so often with my 4 iron, so he looked at me hitting that and got me to put the club in the middle where I hit the other irons and I hit it brilliantly.

I played a round the next day and was hitting a 9 iron 145 (about 135 in the air), up two clubs from before the lesson. I still scored the usual mid 80s because my putting and chipping is shit, but I had 10 birdie chances thanks to improved driving and irons.

This was a fantastic experience. If you're thinking of going for a lesson please do it. I will be going back for chipping and putting lessons which will hopefully help me break 80. </TEXT>

I got the SLDR woods last year, and just purchased the irons, a 60 degree wedge and the putter. 

Also got the bag and the trolley. My old bag was tiny and used to annoy me greatly.

I picked up a range finder as my club only has 150 yard markers and I'm used to having 100s.

I'm off for a lesson and a round of golf. Have a great weekend! </TEXT>

Anything else I'm missing? What essential wet gear items do you carry?

<TEXT> I played golf as a teen. There was lots of pressure on me as my grandfather was a scratch golfer and helped build the course I played at in Ireland. I got down to a 7 handicap but once I started college at 16 I stopped playing. 

I'm 32 now, living in the states and bought a set of clubs last year. I went to the range four or five times last year and I've been about twenty times in the past couple of months. I've went a lot this year.

My game has never been as good as it is now and I feel I owe it to putting in the time with my irons at the range. There's a par 3 course I play that has also helped immensely. 

My grandfather was always an irons guy, never used woods and focused on his short game. Times have changed since then and I love my driver, but I feel the time on the par 3 course has really helped me. 

I played a regular course last weekend and shot a 78, probably my best ever round. I played nine holes today and was 2 over but was rained away - it's thunderstorrm season in North Carolina.

Everything is just clicking lately, and while I love it I can't help but wonder how much better I would be if I never stopped playing. I'm not even a member at any course as I just moved here, but I should really settle on a course soon. 

I don't really have a point to this. I just wanted to talk to some folks who play. This is such a great sport and I'm still relatively young, in the sense that I hopefully have another 30 or 40 years left to play. 

I haven't felt like this since I was a kid. I have golf fever and I love it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Joda-Time: How to show TimeZone on a Time object? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-05 15:24:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> LocalTime is a time representation without a TimeZone.

Is there any other time object that will show the TimeZone?

I tried using DateTime but that obviously includes the date, and if you only use a pattern of "HHmmss" the date defaults to 1970.

**EDIT: Resolved** This gets me what I need: 

    DateTime dt = DateTimeFormat.forPattern("HHmmss").parseDateTime("114937");
    System.out.println(dt.toString(ISODateTimeFormat.time().withZone(DateTimeZone.UTC)));

This month we are focusing on a nice collection of essays which cover a wide range of topics. The picture on the front of this book was taken on his wedding night in their apartment. I actually consider it a dashing photo of him. 

The book itself is very good. Some of the topics are somewhat dated by now but still worth reading about. Their importance hasn't waned with time. Enjoy!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So we finally moved to IntelliJ this week. Well, three members of my group did. I was able to convince management to get a few licenses so we can do a proof of concept. I got us set up on Monday, and it's only Wednesday and I can safely say that I don't think I could ever go back to eclipse.

IntelliJ is far from perfect, there are some annoyances but it does everything eclipse does.... just does them better. I had heard that before and it's only now that I appreciate it.

The only thing annoying me at the moment is hot deployment to tomcat is failing but that seems to be a resource issue more than anything else - it runs out of memory when attempting to do it. I'm forced to use a crappy Lennovo T440 as my work machine.

Thanks to those of you that took the time to convince me to make the jump. This has made my work day so much more exciting. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-04-15 16:21:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi folks,

For those of you that use annotated configurations for your java beans, do you have an ApplicationConfiguration class that sets up all of the beans for you, or do you just stick @Component in the class declaration and deal with it that way?

For example:

    @Configuration
    @ComponentScan(basePackages={"test.package"})
    @PropertySource("classpath:/config/resources/env-settings-${server.env}.properties")
    public class ApplicationConfiguration {
    /** The timeout. */
    @Value("${defaultTimeOutMillis}") 
    int timeout;

    @Bean(name="testFactory")
    public TestFactory testFactory() {
		return new TestFactory(timeout);
    }

Or do you just stick @Component on the TestFactory class and then @Autowire it?

<TEXT> The week ahead is an odd enough one for me. I'm dev on call so chances are I won't get much project work done. I have to complete a Domain Model by Wednesday, and review it with our clients. I only started it on Friday due to delayed analysis from our architects, so there's a bit of pressure there. 

I couldn't sleep last night, woke up at 2am, and spent five hours playing around with how I want the application I'm working on to be structured. I'm delighted I did this, because I realised a few things that I wasn't aware of. We're a week or two behind - I should be coding already but I'm not yet.

Last week I opened the required tickets for certificates and all of that jazz that goes with creating a new internal web service. I'm hoping that stuff gets complete soon so I'm not held up when coding actually happens.

I have a proof of concept application created, and I wrote the code to communicate with the back-end last week but can't test it due to the certificate issue... so I'm fairly far ahead of things as it stands. Once I can test that to make sure it's working it's just a matter of handling a request properly. I should be done with development in a week or two which leaves some time for JUnit and Sonar fun.

Sorry for the ramble. :) So what have you got going on this week? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a few things going on. I need to figure out where a threading issue came from (one I fixed by using joda-time). I also need to document the changes I implemented last week, and state why they are beneficial. I @Autowired everything, and got rid of static everywhere. Almost all variables, objects, and methods were static. However the developer who wrote the old code sees no issues with using static like this so I have to get him on board with the changes. I don't think he's too happy with me at the moment so we'll see how the conversation goes. 

He also had a 1400 line void method which changed the state of things - impossible to test. I made this return something so we can actually test it, but I need to see if I can refactor it. It's filled with business logic so I have to understand that first.

I need to fix some sonar findings and also get started on a new application that is due by the end of the month. That is going to be tough going and will take priority over the other work I am doing.

So lots of coding, refactoring, documentation and meetings this week. Hectic, but fun. :)

I'm working on a framework migration right now for a large JAX-WS webservice, and trying to fix some threading issues. The following issue with Spring screwed me over, but I found a workaround thankfully. https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-9786

Currently getting rid of all static objects and replacing them with @Autowired beans. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Autowired Bean initialized at start up, but null inside a web request? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-20 11:29:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a JAX-WS service which has one Autowired bean like so:
    
    @HandlerChain(file = "handler-chain.xml")
    @WebService(portName = "MyService", serviceName = "MyService", targetNamespace ="http://www.example.com/wsdl", wsdlLocation = "WEB-INF/wsdl/MyService.wsdl", endpointInterface = "example.MyService")
    @BindingType("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/http")
    @Service
    public class MyService extends SpringBeanAutowiringSupport implements MyService, ApplicationContextAware {
	
	/** The log. */
	private static Log log = LogFactory.getLog(AccountFeaturesService.class);
	
	/** The context. */
	@Resource
	WebServiceContext context;
	
	@Autowired 
	Controller201607 controller;

The above controller is autowired fine as the server starts up (and also when I run a JUnit test on it).

However, once a web method comes in and this service is invoked the reference to the object is null.

Is there any way to avoid this without making it static? I'm also trying to avoid calling getBean() inside the web request.

**EDIT** It looks like there is a spring Jira open for this, but it remains unresolved. https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-9786 

I tried the workaround using processInjectionBasedOnCurrentContext(this) in a @PostConstruct but it did not work for me. However, doing a null check in the web method then calling it worked.

We abide by it in the company I work in, but if I'm honest it makes some parts of the code terribly difficult to read. We all have 24 inch monitors now so limiting a line to 80 characters is painful. If statements look terrible, to give one example.

<TITLE> java.lang.AbstractMethodError when calling java.sql.Connection.setClientInfo(Properties) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>     Properties props = new Properties();

    try
    {
    sqlSession.getConnection().setClientInfo(props);
    }


The above code fails with java.lang.AbstractMethodError. I'm not sure if this is some sort of library conflict in my classpath, or what the issue might be. java.sql.Connection is Abstract, as is the method I'm calling, but I can't extend java.sql.Connection in order to write my own setClientInfo().

Google reveals other people having the same issue but no resolutions provided.

One of the caveats here is that I cannot set the client info on the bean when it's initialized because I need to set it when a request is made (it's going to be different every time), so setting the info on the bean in my applicationContext.xml isn't an option for me.

Have any of you seen this before? </TEXT>

It tastes delicious as well. It's really picking up vanilla from the wood and has softened quite a bit. The alcohol content is still very high at the moment, but has definitely lessened.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> JAX-RPC (java.util.Calendar) vs JAX-WS (javax.xml.datatype.XMLGregorianCalendar) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-19 16:53:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Our old code used JAX-RPC, and as a result dateTime was represented as so: 

Timestamp2016-02-17T16:01:16.000**Z**/Timestamp

Our new code using JAX-WS represents the same dateTime as follows: 

Timestamp2016-02-17T11:01:16.000**-05:00**/Timestamp

According to the XMLSchema-2, both represent the same timestamp, just different objects and thus a different representation. https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime-timezones

We're being instructed to change the JAX-WS object to output using the 'Z' timezone offset, but I'm not entirely convinced that's the right approach.

I would rather go with what JAX-WS is suggesting, and inform our customers about the change in representation which is in line with the XMLSchema standards.

How have you folks handled this change? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Original thread with the schedule for 2016 is here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherHitchens_/comments/3yycrr/2016_book_club_schedule/

We had some good discussion last month - thank you for participating! 

This month we are reading Imperial Spoils: The Curious Case of the Elgin Marbles, reissued and updated 2008 as The Parthenon Marbles: The Case for Reunification. 

In 1801, Lord Elgin, then ambassador to the Turkish government, had chunks of the Parthenon sawn off and shipped to England, where they were subsequently seized by Parliament and sold to the British Museum to help pay off Elgins debts.

Christopher makes a very solid case for their return. 

Happy Reading folks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted over Christmas that I managed to secure a case of moonshine (13 jars actually), and that I planned on ageing some of it in a barrel.

Well thankfully I got everything together and started the process today.

I'll update /r/firewater again when it's ready to bottle and consume.

In the meantime here's some photos: http://imgur.com/a/f7dNg

The 5 litre barrel (1.32 gallons) took 6.5 jars of moonshine.

If you have any questions or tips, I'm all ears!

Cheers! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ideas for the sub </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-30 20:14:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi folks,

I don't want this sub to be seen as mine, in any way. It's ours. I'd like it to be community driven. I'm on reddit every day, but work 60 hour weeks so don't always have the time I wish I had. I also run the book club over at /r/ChristopherHitchens_ (the _ is intentional as the actual mod is MIA) and take takes a bit of my time too. So don't rely on me for anything - do whatever you like. I trust you all.

I'd like to open this up for ideas for the sub. As suggested by /u/iHaveAgency [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/438w56/i_started_rpastorarrested_a_couple_of_weeks_ago/czhfr1s) we should add colour coded post flair, and implement some method to stop reposting of old stories (stopping duplicate URLs for instance).

Please reply with anything you'd like to see on here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started /r/PastorArrested as a joke after a discussion with a member on here a few weeks ago.

When I first searched for pastor arrested cases, I was shocked (not sure why I found it surprising honestly) to find just how many Pastors throughout the USA have been arrested - even just in the last six months.

I set up Google alerts (recommend by another member here) to alert me of new news stories of pastors being arrested. I get alerts almost daily, some times more than once per day too. I actually can't even keep up, and I've not posted a lot of stories as I've been too busy with work and real life crap.

The awful thing about this, is that none of the major news agencies are covering the arrests. It appears to not be covered at the national level at all - it's just covered by a local news station that quite often even gets the case details wrong.

Check out /r/PastorArrested for yourself, and if you have any ideas for the sub or how we can/should get the word out please let me know.

**EDIT** If you want to help out and be a mod, etc, let me know! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see calls for his voice, his opinion on current events, everywhere I look. As I peruse reddit, twitter, The New York Times, et al.

We must stop this form of lamenting. It's downright lazy. It's intellectual suicide. It's saying we can't think for ourselves. That is against everything Christopher taught us.

Be the voice you miss. He said the life of an oppossissionist was not meant to be easy. Within our reach is a seemingly endless stream of incidents, events, for lack of a better word "things" to be opposed to.

So oppose them. Write. Find your voice. He said the grave will provide plenty of time for silence and he is silent now, but it doesn't have to be that way. 

It's time for us to carry his torch.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a bit of a shit post, albeit extremely light hearted. 

Growing up in Ireland, I started drinking alcohol at an incredibly young age. I was twelve the first time I was drunk, but I had consumed alcohol a few years prior to this. Twelve is around the time I started drinking regularly. One thing I could never handle at this age, or through my teens was whiskey. Two things would happen to me; violent tendencies and stupefaction. After touching the stuff once I realised it wasn't for me, and stayed the fuck away.

I was visiting Rory, a friend of mine, in the cold of winter one year when I was around twenty-five and we were talking about whiskey and how I couldn't drink the stuff. Rory sat me down and showed me the ropes, so to speak. I learned how to respect it, drink it properly, and hydrate afterwards to avoid hangovers. We did a whiskey tasting with several different kinds of whiskies and I learned the differences, and discovered what I liked.

This started a long and happy whiskey fuelled road. I have an incredible whiskey collection today, the most expensive bottle being costing 5,000. It's a very expensive (and fun) habit. 

However, and this is where Hitchens comes in... Being an avid Hitchens fan I'm well aware he was a lover of Johnny Walker Black and Perrier. Now, I dislike Johnny Walker Black, it's a fairly low-grade whiskey and Hitchens admits he only drank it because one can be guaranteed to find it in almost every bar on the planet. If he stuck to high grade whiskey he would be disappointed when he found himself in a situation where it wasn't available.

This weekend I decided to add Perrier to some low-grade whiskey I was drinking. It wasn't Johnny Walker Black, but it was as good (or as bad) as it, and holy fucking shit. It was a fantastic experience.

I wouldn't add Perrier to expensive whiskey, (and Hitchens would agree there), but when adding it to the low-grade stuff it really makes a fantastic drink.

Congratulations Hitch, you were right, and I have no idea why I ever doubted you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I run the Christopher Hitchens book club, so we're currently reading And Yet which came out late last year. It's a collection of essays, some unpublished before. I read an essay from it last night about the south which said "People wear shorts who shouldn't even wear jeans." Considering I'm living in the south, I found it hilarious. We've all seen people of Walmart by now.

I'm also reading my first ever Wodehouse book which is 3 books in one, called Life with Jeeves.

Wodehouse was quite an artist I have to say. His writing is hilarious, some of the stuff Bertie and Jeeves get up to is just brilliant. I tried to watch the TV series adaption called Fry and Laurie but I didn't like that at all. The book is brilliant though.

<TITLE> Radical: My Journey Out Of Islamist Extremism by Maajid Nawaz </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-01 20:03:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently purchased Radical, by Maajid Nawaz, after reading his conversation with Sam Harris which was released as a book called Islam and the Future of Tolerance.

Link to Radical is here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0762791365

I'm only about 25% of the way through the book but it's quite fascinating.

As ex-muslims yourselves, I assume a lot of you have read this book, or are familiar with Maajid.

What are your thoughts on this book, or on what Maajid has to say? Does it resonate well with you, can you relate?

I'd like to hear your stories on how you became an ex-Muslim, and if you're actually able to leave the religion (perhaps you're not able to due to fear for your safety).

Cheers, and Happy New Year! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I spent New Years Eve at a party at a friends house with my wife, and a bunch of people she knows through work, along with a few others. There were ten or twelve couples there, so a nice enough crowd for a house event.

At the start of the event there were six of us (3 couples), and we got talking about kids. Everyone was in agreement - kids are awful, nobody wants them. It was interesting because most of us wanted them at one point, but said when we sat down and thought about it it was just fucking horrifying and not something any of us wanted to do.

As the night went on more arrived, and said the same thing. I was extremely happy to find an entire group of childfree people who had no intention of having kids. We were all in our twenties and thirties. 

Not one "so when are you having kids?" question was asked. What a night.

Have a happy, healthy and child free 2016 everyone! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Original thread with the schedule for 2016 is here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherHitchens_/comments/3yycrr/2016_book_club_schedule/

This month we are reading **And Yet** a posthumous book released in November 2015 as a [hard copy](http://www.amazon.com/Yet-Essays-Christopher-Hitchens/dp/1476772061) with the [paper back](http://www.amazon.com/Yet-Essays-Christopher-Hitchens/dp/1782394567) coming soon in January 2016. 

This book contains a wide variety of essays penned by Christopher throughout his career. Included is the infamous self improvement essays for Vanity Fair titled: "On the Limits of Self Improvement", along with a great takedowns of Hillary Clinton and Christmas, and a favourite of mine: "Charles Dickens's Inner Child", to name but a few.

<TEXT> I just want to thank all the members of this sub for helping me continue my love of MMA. The debates and discussions, sometimes heated, have been a great learning experience.

The threads where new fans can ask any question without being berated are one of the best things about this place.

Thanks for the fun, and the memories. Wishing you all a happy and safe 2016! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Interesting conversation with my wife's grandparents in the bible belt </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-24 01:09:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm visiting the in-laws for the holiday period. I've discussed my situation on here before but to summarise my wife is Christian, I'm anti-theist. She's cool with it. We haven't told her family simply because it never really came up. I support my wife, I'll go to church with her on Christmas Eve for a candle light ceremony and some singing thing. No preachy shite.

Anyway, I was talking with her grandparents today. They're supposedly catholic, from upstate New York, but they haven't been to church in 15 or 20 years or so. They moved to Tennessee in 1989. They don't like the churches around here and don't trust the pastors. At one point the grandmother said she doesn't believe in heaven at all, and the grandfather talked about a few contradictions in the bible and said he thought it was all bullshit.

This was a welcome revelation to me, obviously. I didn't press the subject too much, I agreed and said you don't need religion to be a moral person. Christians say you do but The Good Samaritan wasn't a Christian and he was a good person. They agreed with that.

It appears as though it's just my wife's mother who is the religious one. My wife likes to sing in church but hates the preaching piece. 

Slowly but surely common sense is making it's way into the family. I'm a happy person presently.

Enjoy the holidays folks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> ELI5: Why are companies allowed to fund presidential campaigns in the USA? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-21 03:45:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I moved to the states a few years ago. Instantly I saw how politicised the country was. It's entertainment here. But I also saw that companies were behind the presidential candidates.

To me, it looks like companies pay presidents, the president brings lawyers with them who will pass the legislation the companies paid the president for.

Is that how this works? It seems corrupt as fuck to me.

Can someone please explain why companies are allowed to fund presidential campaigns? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted here ages ago, and thanked everyone for the support and community. 

I wish to do the same again. My social circle last time was filled with loads of people pressuring my wife and I to have kids.

I dropped a lot of friends, because it became unbearable. A lot of the friends I have now either have kids that are raised or no kids at all, and they all respect what I have to say. Some of the friends I have who have had kids agree with me when I say I have no interest.

With the help of this sub I was also able to get my mother in law to relax and stop asking every time she saw us. The advice on here has been extremely important to my relations with our families.

So thank you, everyone. You are all brilliant and beautiful people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm very excited to try this whisky. Arran offer a limited number of casks for sale to the public, whereby they will age the whisky for you. I believe I may have posted here about that. It interests me greatly. 

This little number is very light in colour. It looks similar to the earlier Kilchoman.  

**Nose**  
Creamy vanilla. This is actually quite complex. There's more going on but I'm not talented enough to figure it out. Very interesting.  
**Palate**  
Wow, definitely cinnamon. Some spice and citrus as well. Malty.  
**Finish**  
Very malty. Beautiful. Some orange as well. It's a medium to long finish. Astonishingly good. 

This is a very good whisky that could kick your ass. Solid - 9/10. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-12-10 00:13:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Tullamore Dew from the crock is my every day whiskey. There's something the crock does to the whiskey to soften it. It's quite spectacular.

In saying that, I'm very apprehensive about this whiskey, as I haven't liked any Tullamore Dew from a bottle. 

I'm not too happy about the Irish offering in this advent calendar, it seems like a poor show.

**Nose**  
Spices and nutty. Perhaps some honey too.  
**Palate**  
Spices again, oaky, creamy. It's not bad actually.  
**Finish**  
Medium finishing, not long at all. Oak, bitter. 

This is an OK effort. I don't think I'd buy a bottle of it though. 6/10. </TEXT>

What are my options here, if any? I feel cheated, as I would have went elsewhere had I been told I wasn't covered. Instead, I was told I was covered and trusted that advice.

I assume there's nothing I can do and I just have to pay up? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am so **excited** to try this whisky. I absolutely love the Balvenie 12 year DoubleWood.

**Nose**  
Sherry obviously, orange is quite prevalent, some sort of sugary thing. It's like Christmas! The Glenfarclas 25 was top quality on all counts, but the nose on this is a lot more interesting. There's so much going on.    
**Palate**  
Sherry again. It's top quality though. Fruity and nutty. This is special.  
**Finish**  
Spices. It's a medium-long finish. This is beautifully matured. 

This is on par with the Glenfarclas 25. Easily 9/10 no question about it. I'll be picking up a bottle of this very soon.  </TEXT>

I'm getting some apple peel - similar to Green Spot. Oak and vanilla. It's very very nice. Leave it for a few minutes to let it open up.

Sherry, spices, vanilla again but not a lot. I didn't get much sherry on the nose but I can get it now.

Very short finish. Sherry again.

This is a great effort. 7/10 from me.

**Nose**  
I could smell this all day long. The peat reminds me of home. There's some fruity thing going on in there as well.

**Palate**  
I'm very surprised by this. I thought it was too young, but it's not at all. This is very light, it's already quite soft. It's oily, smooth, vanilla and some sort of spice. Peat of course.

**Finish**  
It's a short finish as expected. Peat and fruit. 

I'm very surprised at how good this is. A solid 8/10 from me. Amazing work. </TEXT>

**Nose**  
This smells amazing. Toffee, spices. It smells creamy. Very very interesting.  

**Palate**  
Not as smooth as I would have hoped, given how it is on the nose, but it is still quite smooth. Hints of spices again, oak too.  

**Finish**
A very long finish, very nice. One really notices the cream. This finish goes on and on and on.

All I get is vanilla. Vanilla, vanilla, vanilla. It's perhaps citrusy too but I barely get that at all.

Jesus I've no idea. It's... sort of rich or creamy I guess but there's other stuff going on and I just can't pick it up. Maybe some lemon or something like that.

Very rich, creamy again, lasts long enough actually. It's a beautiful finish. 7/10 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do any of you want to continue the book club? Most of the work we haven't covered are in essay form. We could do essay by essay or book by book, whatever suits.

We didn't cover the following in 2015:

* 1987: Imperial Spoils: The Curious Case of the Elgin Marbles. Chatto and Windus (UK)/Hill and Wang (US, 1988) / 1997 UK Verso edition as The Elgin Marbles: Should They Be Returned to Greece? (with essays by Robert Browning and Graham Binns). Reissued and updated 2008 as The Parthenon Marbles: The Case for Reunification, Verso. 
* 1988 Prepared for the Worst: Selected Essays and Minority Reports. Hill and Wang (US)/Chatto and Windus (UK).
* 1990 Blood, Class, and Nostalgia: Anglo-American Ironies. Farrar, Straus   Giroux. Reissued 2004, with a new introduction, as Blood, Class and Empire: The Enduring Anglo-American Relationship, Nation Books, ISBN 1-56025-592-7
* 1993 For the Sake of Argument: Essays and Minority Reports. Verso, ISBN 0-86091-435-6
* 2000 Unacknowledged Legislation: Writers in the Public Sphere. Verso
* 2003 A Long Short War: The Postponed Liberation of Iraq. Plume Books. Originally released as Regime Change (Penguin).
* 2011 Arguably: Essays by Christopher Hitchens. Twelve. UK edition as Arguably: Selected Prose. Atlantic.

We also have his latest book, And Yet to cover as well. 

Some of these books are huge (Arguably, for example, would take more than one month for most people to read, given that real life gets in the way and so on). </TEXT>

<TITLE> When someone says Hitler was an atheist.... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-27 16:23:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have encountered religious people in the USA (and I am sure some of you have too) who have tried to say Hitler was atheist, and thereby use it to show that atheism is "bad" or "evil".

Christopher Hitchens countered this with the example that the Nazis had "Gott mit uns" on their belt buckles (god is with us).

I'm currently reading "I Will Bear Witness", a diary from 1933 to 1941 by Victor Klemperer. Victor was a Jew who lived in Nazi Germany. He writes in his diary an experience of living during this period.

Upon reading his diary, it becomes apparent how things changed on a day to day basis for Jews in Germany. New taxes are imposed "voluntarily", but as Victor notes "Who dares object?". Suddenly Jews are no longer allowed to use public transport, the public libraries, and so on. Their rights were being removed day by day.

Anyway, I wish to bring attention to the following note he made on June 29th 1937: 

Today a Hitler speech in Wrzburg once again pure religious madness. Only that he did not say I, but we. "Providence guides us, we act according to the will of the Almighty. No one can make national or world history without the blessing of this Providence".

I'll be memorizing the date, along with this diary entry for a future retort against someone who tries to claim Hitler was atheist.

P.S I highly recommend reading this book. I've been making notes along the way and keeping them in Microsoft OneNote. It's quite terrifying.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Christmas Whiskey - $500 limit for Irish Whiskey. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-16 03:48:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Each year I usually spend $1000 on Irish whiskey for Christmas. I'm from Ireland and the price of whiskey here is so cheap compared to back home, so I like to indulge.

However, this year finances are kind of tight so I'm keeping it to $500. I usually get one of the fancy Midleton whiskies (like Barry Crockett Legacy), a few bottles of Green Spot, a few Tullamore Dew crocks, John Powers Lane, Redbreast 12 or 21, perhaps some Connemara.

However, I want to do something different this year and try some whiskies I haven't had before along with some that I have had. Of the list below I've had the Powers Signature Release and the Redbreast but haven't had the others.

Here's what I'm thinking so far:  

* Yellow Spot Irish Whiskey Pot Still 12 Year 750ML $89.77  
* Powers Irish Whiskey Single Pot Still Signature Release 750ML $54.99  
* Kilbeggan Irish Whiskey 750ML $29.99  
* Redbreast Irish Whiskey 12 Year 750ML $49.99  
* Clontarf Irish Whiskey 1014 Classic Blend 750ML $25.99  
* Concannon Irish Whiskey 750ML $21.99  
* Powers Irish Whiskey Gold Label 750ML $24.99  
* The Irishman Irish Whiskey The Original Clan 750ML $27.99  
* The Irishman Irish Whiskey Single Malt 750ml $41.39  
Subtotal	$367.09

What else should I add to this list?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure you've all seen it. It's been a big trend for quite some time on Reddit. When someone is talking about a subject and they get labeled "edgy".

It happens a few ways:  
Don't cut yourself on that edge.  
You're so edgy.  

This is also an example: https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/3stnmj/so_edgy_really_makes_me_question_everything

How do you lads usually handle this when it comes up in a conversation? It does nothing but attempt to shut down the conversation by making it look like someone is emotionally invested in something therefore unreasonable, which quite often is not the case at all. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any chance of a rational conversation about religion? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-15 12:51:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Reddit, and most social networking sites like Facebook, and so on, have been absolute shit shows the past few days as a result of the awful events in Paris. It has been almost impossible, or in some cases impossible, to have an unbiased meaningful discussion about what happened,  without the dialogue descending into a toxic shit fest.

I dont really want to talk about what happened in Paris for the most part (I will a bit later), but instead I would like to attempt to have a meaningful discussion about religion (focusing on Christianity and Islam). Ive studied religion for a while now, and I believe I can offer some insight for people who are unfamiliar with either ideology. 

**Disclaimer**:  Sorry if some of this feels condescending. That was not my intention, but upon re-reading it some parts come off that way. 

**Why even bother?**  
Given the rise in the number of Muslim people moving into western countries, I think its important for people in those countries to have an understanding of what Islam is. This can help with integration, and hopefully reduce sectarianism, xenophobia and racism.

**Monotheism**  
There are three major monotheisms most of us are familiar with. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. These three religions are also called Abrahamic religions. There are lots more Abrahamic religions, but these three are the biggest. 

Judaism is the religion of the descendants of Jacob, Abrahams grandson.  
Christianity started as a sect of Judaism, and evolved as a separate religion with distinct beliefs and practices. Jesus can be said to be the central figure, Gods messenger.  
Islam is also a separate religion which arose in Arabia in the 7th century. Muhammad  can be said to be the central figure, Gods messenger.

All three religions have the same God, with a different messenger. Islams Allah is Christianitys God. Allah is directly translated to God.

Jews dont believe that Jesus was Gods messenger. 
Christians obviously believe that Jesus was Gods son and messenger and thats what their faith is based on.
Muslims believe Muhammad was the most recent (and will be the last) messenger sent down by God and their faith is based on his teachings. They believe their religion is the one true religion, and it will be the final solution.  

**The Christian Bible**  
The bible was created a long time ago (parts of it are thousands of years old and were passed down as stories before the written word reached Palestine). The book is basically a collection of texts. 
The bible is broken up into two parts: The Old Testament and The New Testament. Were all familiar with this so I should not need to go into too much detail here. The Old Testament is pretty vicious in parts, and is almost the complete opposite of The New Testament. Most Christians who follow Jesus ignore the Old Testament completely and focus on Jesus teachings in The New Testament, however this part of the bible is not all unicorns and rainbows either. Basically the book suffers from being written a long time ago, when we had no understanding of germ theory, we thought the world was flat, we didnt know about DNA and the double helix, and so on.  

There was a time when most, if not all Christians believed the bible to be the true word of God, completely accurate, infallible. However, with the advancement of society, and scientific discovery, this is no longer the case because some of the texts have been proven to be inaccurate or wrong. For example, Exodus is a text about the mass movement of Hebrew people out of Egypt. Mainstream history and archaeology now consider this to never have happened.   

However, there are sects of Christianity who still think the bible is infallible and they take it literally (Creationists). They believe the world is a few thousand years old, that dinosaurs roamed the earth along side humans, that evolution is wrong and that climate change is not being made worse by man. These people have their own political party in the USA called The Tea Party. Im sure youve  heard of them.  

**The Koran**  
Theres different ways of spelling this (Koran, Quran, etc). Im going with Koran.

The Koran is made up of large parts of the Christian bible with some additional texts and stories added on to the narrative. These are said to have taken place after the Jesus story. Unlike Christianity, where not a lot of practitioners believe the bible to be the true word of God, infallible, and so on, the vast majority of people who follow Islam believe the Koran to be just that.

This can create issues because its a static text that does not change, and as societies move forward and advance, this text does not. The same can be said with the bible.

**Why is a static text a problem?**  
As I said above, as societies change, these texts do not. So people who follow them word for word end up having problems with societal changes. One example is gay marriage. Christians who follow the bible word for word, and Muslims who follow the Koran word for word, both have issues with gay marriage, gay relationships, and so on.  

Obviously, theres different sects. Some Christians are OK with gay marriage, they just believe in love thy neighbor and leave it at that. Others do not. Similarly with Islam, some Muslims are OK with gay marriage, the vast majority are not however.  

**Are there other societal issues that can arise?**  
Yes. I mentioned Creationists above. The Tea Party in America want America to become a theocracy. If this were to happen America would abandon its constitution and it would be ruled by biblical law. This would create obvious issues in a western society. I used gay marriage as an example above, but theres lots of other issues that would arise from this.  Im sure I dont need to go into them.  

**What is Sharia?**  
Im sure youve heard of Sharia by now (also incorrectly called Sharia Law. When you say Sharia Law youre saying Law Law).

Sharia is a system of law outlined in the Koran and also in the Sunnah (the life of Muhammad). This is obviously an old system of law that was created a long time ago. Its also a static law system, in that it does not change (for the most part). Issues arise here because it was written so long ago, parts of it are incompatible with western society today. Parts of it are also unchangeable, infallible, "the true word of God".

Sharia deals with public and private affairs. It rules over diet, sexual relations, crime, politics, economics. 

According to the Pew Research Centers Forum on Religion   Public Life there are approximately 1.62 billion Muslims world wide. Of these 1.62 billion, 1.1 billion believe Sharia should be the law of the land. So approximately two thirds of Muslims worldwide want to be ruled by the law outlined in the Koran.

Sharia also defines jihad, and this is an issue for Islam.

**What are some of the laws in Sharia?**  
1. The mosque and the state are one. For example: Iran.  
2. Jihad may be waged against injustice or an unjust nation. (	Classical texts say Islam is justice, and no Islam is injustice, therefore a just war can be waged against a nation or people who do not submit to Islam.)  
3. Jihad may be waged to spread Islam and force conversions  holy war.  
4. A captive in Jihad may be executed, enslaved, ransomed for money, exchanged for other prisoners, or released freely.  
5. A woman captive of Jihad may be forced to have sex with her captors  
6. Property can be destroyed of confiscated during jihad.  
7.  A second class submission tax must be imposed on Jews and Christians living in Islamic countries.  
8. Slavery is allowed.  
9. A male owner may have sex with his slaves, even if they are little girls.  
10. Apostasy laws including imprisonment and execution may be imposed on anyone who leaves Islam.  
11. Blasphemy laws including imprisonment and execution may be imposed on anyone who insults Muhammad.  
12. Drinkers and gamblers may be flogged.  
13. An eye for an eye is allowed (an injured plaintiff/private citizen is allowed to enact literal revenge).  
14. The hand of a male or female may be cut off.  
15. Homosexuals may be imprisoned, flogged or executed.  
16. Adulterers may be stoned to death.  
17. A woman inherits half what a man does.  
18. A womans testimony in court counts half of what a mans testimony does.  
19. Husbands may hit their wives.  
20. A man may have up to four wives.  
21. A man may marry a pre-pubescent girl.  

Its important to note that not all Muslims believe that Sharia should rule, as explained earlier. Its similarly important to note that of the Muslims who believe that Sharia should rule, not all of them want to obey all of the laws detailed in Sharia. 

If required, I can provide the exact passage in the Koran where the above passages exist. Im sure you can find them with some Google-fu as well.

**Sharia in Western Countries**  
Sharia is practiced in western countries, however not to the degree that is is practiced in the likes of Iran. Muslims living in Western countries usually use Sharia as guidance when dealing with Family affairs, marriages, and so on. Its a toned down version which respects some of the local laws. 

**Extremism**  
Based on the above laws from Sharia, you can see where extremists get their code from. To say groups like ISIS are not Islamic, or to disassociate Islam from the actions of these groups, is doing yourself an injustice. If governments and societies want to deal with jihad, and extremism, they have to face this head on and admit this. 

**Totalitarianism**  
Christianity and Islam have some totalitarian traits. Both say we are born sick and commanded to be well. Both say we have someone watching everything we do, watching us while we sleep, someone who can convict us of thought crime. By design, both religions try to control every aspect of ones life.

Bolshevism and National Socialism tried the same thing with Russian and German societies. Ultimately fascist regimes are doomed to fail because of human innateness. Deep down we want to be free, we want to be just, we want to be true. We get our morals from our genes. Morality has been demonstrated in animals, for example.

For the most part I would like to think that we all want everyone to live and let live. People can have their religion if it makes them feel better. The problem is when that ideology impacts other peoples lives. 

If Muslims wish to integrate successfully into western society they have to abandon certain parts of their faith. I believe the Muslim leaders need to be more upfront and honest about their religion, and the impact it can have on people and societies when followed exactly as is written in the Koran. Sharia is an issue for western societies, and I think it should be against the law. Western governments need to be more up front and honest as well, and admit that groups like ISIS are just following what the Koran says.

<TITLE> Has anyone imported a cask of scotch to the USA before? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-13 03:44:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Lots of Scottish distilleries selling whiskey by the cask, they age it for 10 years for you (which is insured and guaranteed, if the whiskey is shit they'll replace it with as close a match as they have). 

It works out ridiculously cheap, for example Arran distillery offer 200 liters of whiskey for 1650 GBP. There's taxes and stuff you have to pay, plus bottling etc. Those are bulk liters, so it equates to around 215 bottles after the angels share and all that jazz, that's if you age it 10 years. Aging it longer reduces the volume. 

The pricing is here: http://www.arranwhisky.com/sites/default/files/Arran%20CaskPurchaseOffer%20240215_0.pdf along with loads of info.

I am **very** interested in doing this, however I haven't decided on a distillery yet. I'm currently living in the USA, and my buddy and I would like to go halves on a  cask. I just have no idea about importing it here, with customs and what not.

So have any of you lads in the states done this? What's required for customs? Do I need some sort of permit or what? I'm worried that it's such a large amount of whiskey they may not believe it's for personal use. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-11-07 01:53:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I usually go to the one in Apex, but it's not just that butcher who does it. The worst case was a few weeks ago, crab cakes were $1.99 each and he charged me $4.99 for each of them. I was buying 8 so this was obviously massively over priced. 

After I told him the sign said $1.99 each he charged me $2.99 each for them. I had to say it to him a third time before he charged me the correct price.

Today, marinated chicken breast was $3.99 per pound, and he charged me $4.99 per pound. After telling him about it he fixed the price today.

The store is expensive and I only go there for the fruit, veg and meat because the quality is really good but I'm seriously getting sick of being over priced all of the time. 

I could easily have listed 8 or 9 other instances of this.

Has anyone else noticed this happening as well? It can't just be happening to me....

**EDIT** There seems to be some confusion here. The prices I gave were the vic prices. It was the vic price I was looking at when I said he priced it incorrectly. Yesterday, the price of the meat was $6.99 and the vic price was $4.99, but the advertised price was $3.99. He changed it to $3.99 for me. I can show you lads the labels if need be. I still have both of them.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Book Club: November Discussion: Hitch-22 Some Confessions and Contradictions: A Memoir </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-02 19:34:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Original thread with full timeline is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherHitchens/comments/2orcp8/hitchens_book_club_proposed_timetable_input/


This month we are focusing on **Hitch-22**, which again I feel is a book that requires no introduction.

I'm honest when I say this book took me three attempts to successfully finish. I found it difficult for a lot of reasons. I'm 32 so I wasn't alive for a lot of what Hitchens talked about, unfamiliar with a lot of events he was protesting about in his youth, so I had to go look them up and educate myself in order to follow along with the story. That's not a bad thing at all. 

There's a lot of name dropping in this book, but if you can get past that you're in for a real treat.

The death of his mother, the relationship with his father, and his brother is barely even mentioned at all. He didn't mention the women he had relationships with either because he didn't want to offend any of them by leaving someone out; it was better not to tackle it at all.

His relationship with Martin Amis is wonderful and gets a full chapter to itself. Salman also gets his own chapter, as does Fenton. I'm really glad about the latter, because his poetry is outstanding. I recently read The memory of war: Poems, 1968-1982. If you haven't read this please do. You'll be the better for it.

<TITLE> I'm on 400mg of Tramadol for back pain. Been on it since August. It's causing issues. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-02 04:27:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Well, it's only causing issues when I ease back or stop taking it. I wanted to drink alcohol, so I didn't take Tramadol that day. I just had a glass of wine, and I hadn't drank in so long that I was feeling a little buzzed.  Had lots of water, was grand. It's funny because I used to be a big drinker and some nights would put away half a bottle of whiskey. I have zero tolerance now. I did the same yesterday, felt mad dizzy this morning. 

Anyway, on the first occasion, the day after I got really dizzy. When I would move my eyes or head I'd get this strange weird dizzy thing going on along with pulsing in my ears, chest and arms. It was so bad I passed out and I ended up in the ER.

When I started taking Tramadol again the issue went away within about 20 - 40 minutes. 

The doctors are worried because my sister had a brain aneurysm so they're sending me for an MRI to be sure, but I'm sure it's the drug. I almost instantly felt fine after taking Tramadol again.

Does anyone here have any experience with this? How hard will it be to ween myself of this shit? Are there other pain meds I could take that won't do this sort of crap?

Cheers lads. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I moved to the US in 2011. I started on 60k and I'm making 100k now. There's jobs in my area for 120k for a senior java developer, which is what I'm doing now.

I'm nowhere near the likes of New York City, or anything like that. I'm in the RTP (Research Technology Park) area of North Carolina. Ten minutes outside any of the towns here is pure hicksville USA. Point being the wages here are not inflated considering US levels at least.

I'd love to move back to Ireland, but the salaries seem way lower. This is a good thing because it drives investment, but it's also a bad thing because people should be paid more. Our Irish office in Galway, the lads doing exactly what I'm doing are on around 50 or 60 grand. If they knew what I was making they'd lose the plot I'm sure.

Is there any hope of wages rising in Ireland? Is there anything we can do to ensure Irish people get paid more? I see it as a company taking advantage of people to be honest. I don't think it's fair that a developer doing what I do gets paid way fucking less.

Sorry, bit of a rant there.  </TEXT>

South Africa and Australia just haven't shown the form we've seen from New Zealand   Argentina. The explosive, moving at ease rugby. To be fair, New Zealand have had issues but their most recent game against France was very impressive. 16/1 is a massive price for Argentina in my opinion.

<TEXT> Sorry for the delay folks. Real life and all that jazz.

Original thread with full timeline is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherHitchens/comments/2orcp8/hitchens_book_club_proposed_timetable_input/

This month we are focusing on god is not Great: How religion Poisons Everything, a book that actually needs no introduction.

If you haven't read this book before, you're in for a real treat.

This is one of my favorite books written by Christopher, and it's his best seller. He toured the bible belt debating every person who challenged him, and destroyed all of them. 

His chapter on Islam is timeless, and is really needed presently.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Christopher Hitchens was a big supporter of Kurdistan. He would often wear a Kurdistan flag on his lapel. Being a fan of Christopher's writing, I started doing this when I moved to America from Ireland in 2011. Whenever I go out to dinner, I wear the flag of the Kurds in solidarity with Kurdistan's fight for independence. 

I'm currently reading a book by Aliza Marcus titled "Blood and Belief: The PKK and the Kurdish Fight for Independence".

I'm about half way through, and the book is interesting to say the least. Up until now I was not too familiar with the PKK, or Ocalan.

I have some questions which I hope you will help me by answering:  

1. Have any of you read this book? 
2. If yes, how accurate is it? 
3. Can you recommend any other books on Kurdistan's history to help me familiarize myself with you wonderful people   culture.

Thanks for listening. :)  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I moved to America in 2011 I was in the shape of my life. I was 140lbs and fairly ripped. Due to a car crash in 2003, I have pretty bad arthritis in my back which has prevented me from working out as much as I would like. I used to run 10km (6.2 miles) per day, box 5 times a week, and lift 5 times a week. 

That was all blown away, and I gained 40lbs from 2011 up to August of this year. My drinking increased, as did eating crappy food. I was a mess and depressed because I couldn't work out anymore.

Anyway, I cut out the booze completely, cleaned up my diet and I'm back in the gym. The only thing I can do without setting off my arthritis right now is cycling, so I'm doing that but once the gut is lifted I'll be able to do more.

I've lost 11 pounds since September 1st and I'm feeling amazing. This is something I've wanted to do for ages but I kept putting it off because I like whiskey, wine and beer a lot haha.

But as of now I am off the booze, and not allowed to touch it again until I'm back down at 140 pounds, and even then it will be a very strict intake.

<TEXT> I have a fucked up back. Pretty bad degenerative arthritis. My doctor has me on some strong opiates to help with the pain. Opiates, if you're familiar with them, cause constipation. 

Today my doctor told me to try miralax to help soften things up and get things moving again. 

For whatever fucking reason, I misread the instructions and put 3 generous cap fulls into a pint of orange juice.

Within ten minutes things were moving alright, and haven't fucking stopped since. That was over eight hours ago. I haven't eaten in an attempt to stop this (no digestion should equal no shit).

I've literally been pissing out of my ass for what can be described as a full working day. I just hope it stops by tomorrow night because I'm supposed to be taking my wife to the theatre. I'm really lucky I can work from home. 

If I do manage to sleep tonight I really hope I don't fucking shit in the bed.

<TEXT> I'm hoping this makes his DVD as he said they were recording. A yank shouted that the Australians were only free because of America.

Jim schooled him so bad the guy fucking ran away. It was glorious.

"You cunts showed up late to WW2 and are responsible for the deaths of thousands, if not more. Morally reprehensible.". 

"One percent of your population is behind bars. Higher than anywhere else. That's not freedom.". 

"In Holland I can fuck a prostitute and do lines of coke off her back while talking to a cop. Holland has more freedom than America.". 

He said a lot more but i dont want to ruin the DVD. 

Best bit was when he ran off with his wife following. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Original thread with full timeline is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherHitchens/comments/2orcp8/hitchens_book_club_proposed_timetable_input/

This month we are focusing on Hitch's book on Thomas Paine's "Rights of Man".

This is a wonderful follow up to last months book about Jefferson. Like last month, this is a quick read but deeply fascinating. 

I don't have time for much more of a write up as I'm working like crazy for the next while.

As always - enjoy!

P.S god is not Great next month! :D

P.P.S enjoy this lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWxpkcQUCeo </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-08-13 13:55:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yesterday, this story was doing the rounds on Yahoo, Irish Times, BreakingNews.ie -- http://www.breakingnews.ie/world/dont-freak-out-but-scientists-think-octopuses-might-be-aliens-after-dna-study-690779.html

"Don't freak out, but scientists think octopuses 'might be aliens' after DNA study"

Typical bullshit hyperbolic drivel we've been seeing for the past few years. They can't have a headline without injecting feelings and emotion into it.

Anyway, I read the whole fucking report which is here: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v524/n7564/full/nature14668.html

**TLDR;** Overall, not only is it not alien, apparently, at least in some ways, it is more similar to other organisms than people expected.

Don't get me wrong, these are very exciting results. For example that the octopus evolved its sophisticated nervous system using similar approaches to mammals is very, very interesting. And some of the new genes appear to be related to some unique abilities octopuses have that scientists (and engineers hoping to copy them) have been trying to figure out. But its genome is very clearly related to its close relatives, such as the squid.

The media reports are simply wrong. That, unfortunately, is not uncommon. Media sources want clicks or subscriptions, and sensationalist reports encourage that. On top of that, most people writing science articles for media sources don't know anything about science, and many of them get their information third-hand or worse which means these stories tend to get more and more embellished. Overall, it is never a good idea to trust the popular media on scientific topics. If a media report about a scientific topic doesn't seem to make any sense, there is a good chance that is because they got it fundamentally wrong.

<TEXT> I moved to the south in May of 2014. I've been an atheist most of my thinking life. As a child I was actually an altar boy and served at my grandfather's funeral. Even though I'm atheist now I'm kind of proud of that moment. 

My wife is Christian, knows I'm atheist and it's not an issue for us at all. Her family have no idea I'm atheist though, and I'd rather not have to bother with that confrontation.

Anyways. I was in a bar on Thursday, and these two goons started getting into a heated argument over the Confederate flag, and how the US was a Christian nation and all that jazz. Now, one of the guys was fucking carrying so I just let them at it. I wasn't even sure you were allowed to carry and drink alcohol and just chose to keep my trap shut.

After the guys left the barman, visibly pissed off, spoke up about it. I did my usual spiel (which is sourced from Hitchens) stating 99.9% of all species are extinct - some design isn't it? We talk for a good while, and another bar man comes over and joins in and talks about how he's thought the whole thing was shit but hasn't been able to speak to anyone about it.

Two customers come in and they share our views as well.

It was kind of cool, not something I expected to happen in the south.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm on a bit of an Orwell binge as of late, focusing on his lesser known novels. I just finished Keep the Aspidistra Flying, which I found to be a very agreeable book. However, I couldn't help but notice how often Orwell used the word 'presently' to start a lot of his sentences. At one stage he used it twice in one paragraph.

I just started reading Down and Out in Paris and London, and there he is at it again. I try to skim over it and ignore it, as it can be bothersome.

Has anyone else noticed this? Does it bother you at all?

<TEXT> Here's mine, from Christopher Hitchens: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1572150/quotes

Let's say that the consensus is that our species, being the higher primates, Homo Sapiens, has been on the planet for at least 100,000 years, maybe more. Francis Collins says maybe 100,000. Richard Dawkins thinks maybe a quarter-of-a-million. I'll take 100,000. In order to be a Christian, you have to believe that for 98,000 years, our species suffered and died, most of its children dying in childbirth, most other people having a life expectancy of about 25 years, dying of their teeth. Famine, struggle, bitterness, war, suffering, misery, all of that for 98,000 years. Heaven watches this with complete indifference. And then 2000 years ago, thinks "That's enough of that. It's time to intervene," and the best way to do this would be by condemning someone to a human sacrifice somewhere in the less literate parts of the Middle East. Don't lets appeal to the Chinese, for example, where people can read and study evidence and have a civilization. Let's go to the desert and have another revelation there. This is nonsense. It can't be believed by a thinking person. Why am I glad this is the case? To get to the point of the wrongness of Christianity, because I think the teachings of Christianity are immoral. The central one is the most immoral of all, and that is the one of vicarious redemption. You can throw your sins onto somebody else, vulgarly known as scapegoating. In fact, originating as scapegoating in the same area, the same desert. I can pay your debt if I love you. I can serve your term in prison if I love you very much. I can volunteer to do that. I can't take your sins away, because I can't abolish your responsibility, and I shouldn't offer to do so. Your responsibility has to stay with you. There's no vicarious redemption. There very probably, in fact, is no redemption at all. It's just a part of wish-thinking, and I don't think wish-thinking is good for people either. It even manages to pollute the central question, the word I just employed, the most important word of all: the word love, by making love compulsory, by saying you MUST love. You must love your neighbour as yourself, something you can't actually do. You'll always fall short, so you can always be found guilty. By saying you must love someone who you also must fear. That's to say a supreme being, an eternal father, someone of whom you must be afraid, but you must love him, too. If you fail in this duty, you're again a wretched sinner. This is not mentally or morally or intellectually healthy. And that brings me to the final objection - I'll condense it, Dr. Orlafsky - which is, this is a totalitarian system. If there was a God who could do these things and demand these things of us, and he was eternal and unchanging, we'd be living under a dictatorship from which there is no appeal, and one that can never change and one that knows our thoughts and can convict us of thought crime, and condemn us to eternal punishment for actions that we are condemned in advance to be taking. All this in the round, and I could say more, it's an excellent thing that we have absolutely no reason to believe any of it to be true.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Original thread with full timeline is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherHitchens/comments/2orcp8/hitchens_book_club_proposed_timetable_input/

This month we are focusing on Thomas Jefferson: Author of America, part of the Eminent Lives series.

If you have not done so, you really ought to listen to Hitchens speak about the book in a library he oftentimes visited in La Jolla here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_iOJtAuzk4

The book itself is a quick enough read, but Hitchens vast knowledge of Jefferson can truly be seen in the above video. This video is also how I came across The Black Jacobins, a book by C.L.R James which is well worth reading. 

I've rambled enough - time to shut up. Happy reading folks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a maven web app, using WAS 8.5.5.

On app startup I'm getting the following error:

This means there's some sort of mismatch of jars (httpclient   httpcore) in my classpath.

To get more info, I ran the following code:

              } catch (IOException e) {
                     // TODO Auto-generated catch block
                     e.printStackTrace();
              }

This gave me the following output:

 start Outputting resoure info: /org/apache/http/message/BasicLineFormatter.class /org/apache/http/message/BasicLineFormatter.class null
 start jar:file:/C:/RAD9.0/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer_2/plugins/com.ibm.ws.prereq.jaxrs.jar!/org/apache/http/message/BasicLineFormatter.class

These are both obviously loaded to WAS on startup - how do I stop this from happening? I tried changing the priority of the module loading in the app settings - by setting load parent last, but that stopped the app from coming up at all.

Any ideas? </TEXT>

If it wasn't for the French revolution, the San Domingo revolution may not have been a success. The French revolution helped emancipate the slaves on that French colony, however it must be recognized that Toussaint L'Ouverture's men had to rely on their own strengths and abilities to pull it off.

<TITLE> What's your favourite Hitchens essay or polemic? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-09 16:49:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's quite a difficult question to answer, and it's almost self defeating in a way. It's like asking someone what their favourite book or movie is. Our attitude changes over time, as does our mood, so it's extremely subjective but it's certainly not a pointless discussion.

For a long time I have loved his essay on Churchill whereby Hitchens discusses being raised on "the cult of Winston Churchill" and America's obsession with him, but I shouldn't stop there. 

Hitchens could be extremely funny, and one only has to look as far as Joyce in Bloom to see multiple examples of this. This is an essay that's mostly about wanking, and Joyce's obsession with it. He even jokes about it impacting Joyce's eye sight.

Another favourite of mine is Prisoner of Shelves; Hitchens talks about the available shelf space in his apartment, which is considerable, continuing to be outrun by the appearance of new books and he explains why he has decided to stack them vertically (a suggestion from a Vanity Fair colleage). This actually led to me doing the same, and buying lots of vertical shelves which ended up saving enormous space at home.

Stand up for Denmark is a great polemic calling for everyone to get behind the country after the cartoon incident. I try to read this every few months to remind me of the need for free speech (as well as listening to the debate in Toronto).

What is your favourite Hitchens essay or polemic, and why?

I just finished it, and I found it extremely hard to put down. It was a real page turner. I've read reviews on GoodReads, and it appears people either love it or hate it. They either got the humour, or they didn't, and I guess that makes sense because humour is subjective.

I loved the writing style, it wasn't just that the book was funny but it was because it was *so* funny.

Christopher Hitchens wrote a review of the book here, and he can say it better than I can. http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/05/the-man-of-feeling/302486/

<TEXT> Original thread with full timeline is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherHitchens/comments/2orcp8/hitchens_book_club_proposed_timetable_input/


This month we are focusing on Love, Poverty and War a book which is a bit of a monster to tackle in a month. I'm actually not sure many of you are following along anymore, as discussion has been almost nonexistent. However, I'll soldier on because I feel this is worthwhile. This is a book that might be hard to finish in a month, as it's tough reading a variety of essays on different subjects. An activity which made it easier for me was tackling All Art is Propaganda and also Facing Unpleasant Facts; both are collections of Orwell's essays put together by George Packer.

If you are still involved, I encourage you to discuss the essays in this text. My favourite is the opening essay on Churchill. 


Don't forget to ask questions about anything Christopher says. This goes for all books we will encounter. One of reasons we are taking part in the book club is to encourage discourse, to question everything, to discuss the contents and also make note of the recommendations for further reading. Happy reading folks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ant to Maven question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-24 15:58:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi folks,

I'm in the middle of an ant to maven migration for one of our applications (a web service). Our build.xml isn't too big - around 400 lines of code or thereabouts.

I have almost everything working. The part I'm stuck on is as follows:

In ant we have:  

    target name="gen.wsdl"
       echo message="generating WSDL for ${service}"/
       java taskname="WSDLGenerator" classname="com.wsdlgenerator.WSDLGenerator"
          classpathref="gen.wsdl.classpath"  fork="true" failonerror="true" dir="${wsdl.dir}"
          arg line="${opargs}"/
       /java
    /target

I'm trying to do this in Maven like so:

    plugin
	groupIdorg.apache.maven.plugins/groupId
	artifactIdmaven-antrun-plugin/artifactId
	version1.8/version
	executions
	  execution
	    idcompile/id
	    phasecompile/phase
	    configuration
	         target
                 echo taskname="WSDLGenerator" message="generating WSDL for ${service}"/
	                  java classname="com.wsdlgenerator.WSDLGenerator" classpathref="${gen.wsdl.classpath}" fork="true" failonerror="true" dir="${wsdl.dir}"/
	            		argline${opargs}/argline
	         /target
	   /configuration
	   goals
	      goalrun/goal
	   /goals
	/execution
	/executions
    /plugin	    

This is not working and I'm getting the following error:

[WSDLGenerator] generating WSDL for ${service}
     [java] java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/wsdlgenerator/WSDLGenerator

Now, firstly - I've removed the full package name so I'm not breaking any NDA at my company, it's a bit longer than com.wsdlgenerator.WSDLGenerator. I have this included as a dependency in the pom, and when I type "com.wsdlgenerator.WSDLGenerator" in any of the classes it is recognized, so I'm not entirely sure why Maven is falling over here.

Have any of you run into this before? Am I even doing this the correct way?

**EDIT** I resolved this by using the maven.compile.classpath instead of the custom gen.wsdl.classpath. I'm not running into issues with the argline parameters but that's a separate issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Rachel Papers is Martin's first book written when he was in his early twenties, published in 1973.

This is the third book of Martin's I have read (the first two being Experience [his autobiography] and The Zone of Interest).

I probably should have started with The Rachel Papers. I was happy to see him talk about things like "experience" in the novel, so I can see that was a constant theme throughout his life and why he gave that the name of his autobiography.

The Rachel Papers was excellent, kind of like a mature Catcher in the Rye. I found it very easy to read, very hard to put that, and I was done with it after several hours. I haven't been that captivated by a book in a while.

<TEXT> I just finished Lost for the third time with my wife. It was her second viewing.

It's kind of mad for me to think about how long ago the show first aired.

I'm at that point where no other show is interesting to me. I've tried to start a few other shows and I'm bored within 5 minutes and just cannot get into them - I'm just not able to give them the attention they deserve right now.

I'm actually considering watching Lost a 4th time, but I'm also thinking I should wait a bit.

I'm seriously suffering from post-Lost fever. I've even read the pilot, and holy crap the detail in there is insane. It's worth reading if you have not read it yet.

Why cant I connect to television like I did with Lost? i think it's a combination of the characters and the island. Almost every island scene was beautiful, and almost all characters were loveable. I think Kate was the only one I did not like.

<TEXT> I spent a weekend in Dublin on the lash with my friends, and I was a bit sore on the Sunday as I'm sure you can imagine. I picked up a few cans of beer in Heuston station, and boarded the last train that night. It was around 9pm and it was pitch black outside, and had been dark since around 5pm.

I get on one of the front carriages and just walk all the way to the back. I don't want to be near anyone and wouldn't mind a carriage all to myself so off I go to the back. I get to the last carriage and sure enough there's nobody in it. Lovely job. 

If you're unfamiliar with the carriages, they have a table with 4 seats around it. Something like this: http://citytransport.info/Digi/P1160991.jpg

So I make myself comfortable, crack open a beer, and the train starts to move. About five minutes into the journey, this fella in his 50s or thereabouts comes in and sits a few seats up from me. He makes eye contact with me and I nod as if to say "hello", but I get no reaction. He's just staring at me, really weird like. His eyes are fairly large, as if he's mad in the head or something.

I look away anyway, and try to focus on the outside of the train hoping that he'll either go away or just stop looking at me.

I go into my bag for a book, hoping that will give him the idea that I don't want to fucking deal with the cunt. My bag is on the floor so I bend down and root around in it, find my book, and when I sit back up straight with the book in my head he's sitting down at my table right across from me. 

Every hair on my body stands up at this point. I'm not even joking like. I'd say the look I had on my face must have been hilarious. He was there across from me, with the big stupid look on his face.

"Well how're ya? Have you any sisters have ya?"

I says I have yeah, I have one sister.

"I bet you'd love to fuck her wouldn't ya? Does she have a smelly pussy does she? I bet she does yeah"

He says that to me really quickly... with this deep dirty voice.

So obviously I'm dealing with a fucking nutter of some sort, a demented perverted fuck anyway.

"If you think I'm going to let anyone talk about my sister like that, you're a big fucken eejit. Take that back - I don't think those sorts of things because I'm not fucked up in the head".

I'm not quite sure why I said that. I probably should have just got up and left, or told him to fuck off. 

He says sorry and sits there in silence. Looking at the window, then me, then window. When looks at me he's really staring at me like, studying me, thinking of something. It's quite clear.

A few minutes go by and I'm fucking dying for yer man to come along who checks the tickets because I did not think there were many people on the train to begin with.

Just as I finish my can, and get another from my bag he lunges at me with those eyes of his all fucking crazy like. He starts choking me with both his hands, and he hops up on the table so he's kneeling on it with both hands squeezing the shit out of my neck.

Now, it's a cliche to say time went as if it was in slow motion but that really is how it felt. Despite it feeling like time slowed down I felt like I didn't have time to think about the situation that much because I couldn't focus on anything but the pain my neck. My windpipe was fully closed, with the front of it touching the back. My fuck the pain was brutal and I couldn't catch my breath at all.

I studied self defense as a teenager, and there's a move you can do to get your arm over one of his arms, and under the other one, and then if you turn you'll disrupt his grip.

I did that and it worked, and I had about 1 or 2 seconds to react, so as i'm pushing him off his hold on my neck is released and I'm able to connect with his chin and knock him back a bit. I jump up, still trying to catch my breath and get over the awful pain in my throat, and I just lay into him. Punch after punch, and he still has that stupid fucking look on his face. 

I stop hitting him, and I'm fucking exhausted man. Heart is going 90, so I sit back down across from the table where we were just trying to think like. He gets up and goes into one of the other carriages, and I'm still in disbelief... did this really happen?

I go to the rest room to clean myself up a bit, and I come back to my seat. The ticket fella comes around and I let him know the story and I give a description of who did it. The ticket fella asks if I could point him out and I said I could, so we walk through the carriage and I see him sitting across from a group of girls and I point him out. He has his back to us, and the girls see me pointing him out and they recognize there's something up.

The cops are called and they're waiting at the first stop which is Portlaoise station. I go back to my seat and the ticket inspector stays there watching yer man in case he moves. He tells me to be ready to meet with the cops when the train stops, and I tell him I'll stay put and they can come to get me and he agrees.

The train stops anyway, and people get off the train and he's one of them. He's grabbed by the police, handcuffed and led away. I can see all this out my window, because when he got off the train he started to walk up towards where I was - everyone who got off the train was leaving that way.

A cop comes into my carriage and asks me to come to the station with him so I can make a formal statement. This is the last fucking train though, so if I do that I'm fucked.

He says he'll ensure I'm brought home safely after I give the statement. So I do that, I explain the whole story, and true to his word the fella who took my statement drove me all the way from Portlaoise to Shannon, to my front door.

I never found out what happened to him, because I moved to the states soon after the incident and I never followed up with it. I haven't a clue who the fuck he was or what his deal was. It was a very strange experience for me, and I'm glad I was able to defend myself with one of the only fucking moves I remember from self defense. When I think back on it, it's as if it was a different life or something. It's just so bizarre and I never thought anything like that would happen to me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Weird event leaving UL </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My wife, who was my girlfriend at the time, was studying in the University of Limerick, in Limerick City, Ireland. She's from the states and was studying abroad, and that is how we met. She was living on campus (I think the place was called Cappa, or something like that).

At the time I had a very flashy convertible, a real head turner. I worked doing operations support for a big multinational at the time, and some times I'd start work at 5am. So I was leaving her place around 4am to get back home to Shannon to start work - it was a remote job when I was on the 5am shift.

Anyways, I'm coming out of UL and it's ridiculously foggy. Like, I can see about 10 - 15 feet in front of me. There's a roundabout just around the corner, so I slow down and then I see some lad run out in front of the car and hold his hand out to stop me. His face is covered with a balaclava. I'm like, what the fuck. Right at this time, someone runs up and tries to open my driver-side door, but for whatever reason I had locked the door.... I NEVER LOCK THE DOOR... but I did it then for some reason... I just felt it was a really early time and there could be freaks around and you'd never know what could happen being at a red light in the city with a car like this.

Anyway, when that happened I just floored it, and I was in such a rage that I aimed for the cunt standing in front of me and luckily I missed him.

My heart was fucking racing, hair standing up all over me. I got home and told a friend of mine about it who was online on Facebook, and he lived close enough to UL so he took a trip over in his car but didn't find anyone.

The guy who tried to open my drivers door had a hatchet in his hand.

Fucking madness. I completely forgot about this until I started reading through the sub.

It's not the most fucked up thing to happen to me, I'll post another thread a bit later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Has anyone else read this book? I saw a few posts from 4 years ago but nothing recent.

This book was written in 2005, and I came across it by way of Christopher Hitchens who, when asked what he was reading about ten years ago gave this title.

I'm about half way through and I'm absolutely loving it. If you like war books, or are a Catch-22 fan then I'm sure you'll enjoy this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Original thread with full timeline is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherHitchens/comments/2orcp8/hitchens_book_club_proposed_timetable_input/

This month we are focusing on No One Left to Lie To: The Triangulations of William Jefferson Clinton. Verso. Reissued as No One Left to Lie To: The Values of the Worst Family in 2000.

This book is a scathing attack on Clinton, and one which hasn't drawn enough attention. If I recall correctly, Christopher's deal with his publisher was for 5 grand for this book.

Please don't forget to ask questions about anything Christopher says. This goes for all books we will encounter. One of reasons we are taking part in the book club is to encourage discourse, to question everything, to discuss the contents and also make note of the recommendations for further reading.
Happy reading folks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Have any of you parsed WSDL files before. Which parser did you use? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-27 15:09:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey there,

I've been tasked with creating a WSDL parser, which checks for specific requirements our team has which are not covered by the current parsers out there. We run our WSDL files through things like the WS-I parser prior to parsing it for our needs, and it's that final piece that I am working on.

Anyway, I'm using javax.wsdl to parse the WSDL file, and also using XSOM to parse the XSD files.

This is working really well and I'm almost finished, however I wanted to know if the APIs I'm using are ones you guys have used before, or if there are better alternatives out there?

Thanks! </TEXT>
