<TITLE> I Love Pi Music Player But It's Missing One Important Feature </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 03:00:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've mostly used Google Play Music, however I'm canceling my subscription so I don't really see a reason to have to put up with the ridiculous amount of lag it has. A good alternative I've found is Pi Music, but there's one thing I loved about GPM that Pi doesn't do. If I was listening to a playlist, and then I added another playlist to the queue, if on shuffle the queue would randomly "splash" that new playlist instead of keeping it together.  
  
Since that may have sounded confusing, here's an example. Say I have playlist 1 playing on shuffle, consisting of "A,B,C,D, and E". Then I add playlist 2 to the queue, which consists of "F,G,H,I,J". On GPM, the resulting playlist would be something like "A,G,H,B,E,J,C,E,F,D...etc.". However, on Pi it comes out like "A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J". Like it just places one shuffled playlist after another. I couldn't find any settings in Pi to fix that, so does anyone know of a music player that has this functionality? Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've read The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho several times and each time it's still so awesome, especially the mysticism that comes along with it that plays on Abrahamic Esotericism and the like. I would also put HP Lovecraft under the same category to an extent, although taking on more of an Anthroposophic theme rather than Abrahamic Esotericism like The Alchemist. I hope for this thread to just be sort of a discussion of the theme and perhaps offer some other novels that put similar or different perspectives on the oddly specific genre. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A Buddhist can believe in whatever they want. How much these beliefs will help is what matters. For Buddhist practice, the belief in God is pretty much unnecessary. We know that there is dukkha, we know the cause of dukkha, we know the cessation of dukkha, and we know the path to the cessation of dukkha, and whether or not there is a God this isn't going to change. In a practice where one has to detach themselves from pretty much everything including nothing, it's easiest to start with what we cannot directly observe. </TEXT>

For us to gaze?  
  
Beg for change!

Your heart cant go anywhere,  
Come sit awhile.  
  
Mind is the hammer,  
And not-mind is the nail,  
So one can render incomplete.  
  
The ground moves quickly,  
Too quick for one to see,  
And yet horses trot and rabbits leap,  
And all you do is complain.  
  
See with your tongue and wash your feet,  
As to prove your thoughts real.  
Where does the sky end and begin?  
And where are your thoughts?  
  
Try to make sense of this,  
Like a frog under a brick.  
The floor is almost finished,  
But the Ganges has already dried! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Imagine: there is a king, who is dull-witted. He has little wisdom. And there is a doctor, who is obstinate. But the King does not know this and pays him a salary. This doctor uses the products of milk to cure all illnesses. Also, he does not know where the illnesses come from. He may be versed in the medicine of milk, but for him there exists no difference between a cold and a fever. He prescribes milk for all illnesses. This King was unaware that this doctor was ignorant of the pleasing and non-pleasing, the good and bad aspects of milk. But there was a Doctor who knew eight different treatments for illnesses and who was able to cure all diseases. This Doctor was versed in prescription and medicines and had come from a far-off place. And the King's doctor did not know how to ask and learn. He was rash and haughty. So the learned Doctor cordially invited the King's doctor and looked up to him [as an expedient] as his master and asked of him the secret of treatment. He said to the King's doctor: "I now invite you and make you my teacher. Please be good enough to teach me." The King's doctor said: "If you serve me for 48 years, I will teach you the art of medicine. " Then, at these words, the learned Doctor said: "I shall do as you tell me. I shall do my best and run errands." Then the King's doctor, taking the learned Doctor along with him, went to see the King. At this, the visiting Doctor explained to the King the various ways of treatment and even other things. He said: "Please know, O great King! Know well! This Dharma is like this and you will well cure illnesses." On hearing this, the King recognised the ignorance and lack of knowledge of his own doctor. He at once drove him out of the country. And he respected the new Doctor all the more. Then the new Doctor said to himself: "It is now time to teach the King." He said to the King: "O great King! If you truly love me, please make me a promise!" The King replied: "I shall give you, should you desire it, even my right hand or any part of my body." The new Doctor said: "You may give me all statuses, but I myself do not wish to have much. What I desire you to do for me is to proclaim to the people of every corner of your land that henceforth they are not to use the milk medicine, which the former doctor told them to use. Why not? Because much harm and poisonous results arise [from it]. Any person who still takes this medicine should be beheaded. If the milk medicine is not used, there will be no untimely deaths; all will go in peace. That is why I ask this of you." Then the King said: "What you ask me to do is a trifle. I shall at once issue an order and see to it that anyone who is ill does no take milk as a medicine. Any person who does will be beheaded." At this, the learned Doctor made several kinds of medicine, which tasted pungent, butter, salty, sweet, and sour. With these, treatment was given, and there was no case in which illness could not be cured.  
"After some time, the King himself became ill, and the Doctor was called in. The King said: "I am now ill. How am I to be cured?" The Doctor thought about the illness of the King and saw that the milk medicine was good [here]. So he said to the King: "What you are now suffering from can very well be cured by milk. What I said before about the milk medicine was not true. If you take it now, you will be cured. You are now suffering from a fever. It is right that you should take milk." Then the King said to the Doctor: "Are you mad? Is it a fever? And you say that if I take milk, it will cure me? Before, you said it was poison. Now you tell me to take it. How is this? Do you mean to cheat me? What the former doctor said was good, [yet] you despised it and said that it was poison, and you made me drive him away. Now you say that it well cures illness. From you you say, the former doctor ought to excel you."  
"Then the learned Doctor said to the King: "O King! Do not say this, please. A worm eats on [a piece of] wood and [the shape of] a letter comes out. This worm does not know anything of letters. A wise person sees this. But he does not say that this worm understands letters. And he is not overcome by surprise. O great King! Please know: so was it also with the former doctor. To all illnesses he gave medicine made from milk. This is as in the case of the worm that eats on wood, as a result of which a form like a letter emerges. The former doctor did not know how to distinguish between the pleasing and non-pleasing aspects, the good and the bad." Then the King wanted to know: "What do you mean he did not know?" The guest Doctor answered the King: "This milk medicine is harmful, but it is also a manna."  "How can you say that this milk is manna?" "If you milking cow has not taken the lees, the slippery grass and the wheat refuse, and if the calf fares well, and if the cow was not grazed too high up on the land or in a low and wet place, if the cow is given pure water and not made to run or made to live among the bulls, and if feeding is done regularly, and if the place it lives in is fit, the milk gained from such a cow well does away with all illnesses. This can well be called the manna of medicine. Any other milk is poison."  
"On hearing this, the King praised the great Doctor: "Well said, well said, O great Doctor! Today, for the first time in my life, I know of the pleasing and non-pleasing, that which is good and not good in the milk medicine. Taking this, I am now well. I shall at once proclaim to the people that they may well take the milk medicine." On hearing this, the people of the country, angry and resentful, said: "The great King is now caught by a devil. Is he mad? He cheats us and makes us take milk." All the people, angry and resentful, came to the King. The King said to them: "Be not angry, and have no resentment. To take milk or not to take it all comes from the science of medicine. I am not to blame." At this, the great King and the people all jumped for joy. They all the more respected and honoured the Doctor, and made offerings to him. That is how all the people took the milk medicine and regained their health.  
"Know, O you Bhiksus! The same is the case with the Tathagata, the Alms-deserving, the All-Enlightened-One, the Unsurpassed Best Trainer, the Teacher-of-Heaven-and-Earth, the Buddha-World-Honoured One. He comes as a great Doctor and subdues all tirthikas and bad doctors. In the presence of kings and all people, he says: "I shall become the King of doctors and subdue tirthikas." Thus we say:   "There is no self, no man, no being, no life, no nurturing, no knowing, none that does, and none that receives." O Bhiksus! Know that what the tirthikas say is like the case of a worm that eats upon [a piece of] wood, from which, by chance, there appears what looks like a letter. Because of this, the Tathagata teaches and says no-self. This is to adjust beings and because he is aware of the occasion.   Such non-self is, as occasion arises, spoken of, and it is [also] said that there is the Self. This is as in the case of the learned Doctor, who knows well the medicinal and non-medicinal qualities of milk. It is not as with common mortals, who might measure the size of their own self. Common mortals and the ignorant may measure the size of their own self and say, 'It is like the size of a thumb, like a mustard seed, or like the size of a mote.' When the Tathagata speaks of Self, in no case are things thus. That is why he says: 'All things have no Self.'  
Even though he has said that all phenomena [dharmas] are devoid of the Self, it is not that they are completely/ truly devoid of the Self. What is this Self? Any phenomenon [dharma] that is true [satya], real [tattva], eternal [nitya], sovereign/ autonomous/ self-governing [aisvarya], and whose ground/ foundation is unchanging [asraya-aviparinama], is termed 'the Self' [atman]. This is as in the case of the great Doctor who well understands the milk medicine. The same is the case with the Tathagata. For the sake of beings, he says "there is the Self in all things"  O you the four classes! Learn Dharma thus!"  
  
This is an excerpt from the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, which reintroduces the idea of a Self into Buddhism. Throughout the sutra, the Self that is Nirvana is said to be very different than the idea of Self in other religions and philosophies. Later on it is said something along the lines of "there is neither Self nor no Self, and that is why there is Self."  
  
It took me a while to understand this as well, questioning if this is even Buddhism anymore. There are different interpretations of this Self (known also as Buddha-nature, Tathagatagarbha, Ground Luminosity, or Nirvana itself). For example, in the Lankavatara Sutra, the Buddha said that he teaches the Tathagatagarbha in order to draw adherents who aren't ready to part with the idea of Self.  
  
Zen sees it in the way that I interpret. There's a Zen saying:  
Before one studies Zen, mountains are mountains and waters are waters;  
After a first glimpse into the truth of Zen, mountains are no longer
mountains and waters are no longer waters;  
After enlightenment, mountains are once again mountains and waters once again waters.  
  
You begin to realize the Self nature of all things as the fact that there is no Self nature to these things. It's a Self that is completely void of any understanding, essentially one that "doesn't exist". If you try to understand the nature of the Self you will fail, which is why the Buddha told us to detach ourselves of thinking there is a Self. Only by realizing there is no Self will the Self become visible.  
  
I really suggest you read this Mahaparinirvana Sutra, it will throw everything you think you know into a spin. It's very long, and pretty dry at times, however it's a teaching of the Dharma that seems completely heretic but ends up working so well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the Mahayana Sutras depict teachings by the Buddha that he apparently taught later in his life. They were written about 100 to 200 years after the Pali Canon, which most people will agree is the closest to what the Buddha actually said and taught. The Mahayana Sutras are considered illegitimate by the Theravada School, which constitutes around 35% of global Buddhists (Mahayana ~60%, Vajrayana ~5%). The Mahayanists believe the Pali Canon to also be legitimate but believe they are meant to be "lesser" teachings intended for those who do not have the capacity to understand the "greater" teachings of the Mahayana.  
  
In truth, however, there really isn't any way of knowing what the Buddha actually said or not, as even the Pali Canon was first written down around 400-500 years after the Buddha's death after being orally passed down during that time period. We know for a fact that the Pali Canon isn't even the exact words of the Buddha as his attendant Ananda was the one who first recited them after the Buddha died. The best thing to do is to put the teachings into practice and see what works, because really it doesn't matter who said anything, if it's true it's true. There's even a sutta in the Pali Canon of a man who received a discourse from the Buddha without knowing that it was the Buddha, and because his mind was freed from "who's saying what" he was able to attain enlightenment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many of the Mahayana Sutras have the Buddha telling his disciples not to think of him as being subject to extinction and instead to view him as eternal. Of course this is saying that the Buddha has fully transcended life and death and there is only the Dharmakaya which the Buddha has fully merged with. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I Feel Like the Future of Good Lock Isn't Looking Good For Us </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-21 06:45:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So Good Lock hasn't been updated for a while, and I've been hoping for an update to come out with more of a Nougat style (edge to edge notification shade and lock screen notifications, no gap above the quick toggles, etc.) however, even if this happens, us Note 4 users probably will not be getting it.  
  
Samsung's Nougat UI is already pretty close to stock, especially with a material theme it could look almost identical. This is making me wonder if Good Lock is even going to get an update at all. Also, the Note 4 doesn't even officially support Good Lock and all the devices that do are getting Nougat upgrades, so if there is a new build of Good Lock at this point it will probably be only installable with Nougat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, how very big of you. You're an alpha male, are you? Well, let me clue you in on something: Alpha Males haven't been in charge for a good couple of decades. Obviously, this tirade is directed on a High School level. Once you get out of high school, and begin working at your dead-end office job, you know who your boss is going to be? That's right, that pasty nerd you made fun of. It's funny, you see. The majority of the women you are talking about, despite the blatant lies you've slipped in, and the generalizations which remain moderately untrue, are frankly, idiotic sluts. The fact that you're trying to taunt us with them is inane, because while they sound appealing in text, in reality, we wouldn't want anything to do with the *ing skanks. And furthermore, thank you for "ing every girl in the school (I bet you can bench 2000 pounds too, amirite?)." Honestly, thank you. Why, you may ask? Because, by taking away the easy route, you have brought pain upon us. You have brought us misery, you have forced us to adapt to that misery, and to grow as people. Luxury doesn't incite growth, pain does. So while you're busy sticking it in your AIDS-ridden skanks, we're studying, learning, gaining skills that are necessary for life. You may scoff at this, call us stupid nerds for not getting the pussy while it's hot, but guess what? We're going to get it eventually. You said so yourself, women love power. So, eventually, you're going to find a women you love as much as she primally needs you. You're going to get married, maybe settle down a bit. Wild sex for the first two years, but after a while, she'll get ansy. She'll grow tired of the novelty of the Alpha Male. Your relationship will become the dull forced marriage that is seen constantly in America. You'll likely divorce her and move on, getting a younger wife that'll need you as much as your old wife did when you first married. Seems swell, doesn't it? I can assure you, it isn't. By now, we have risen to power. While you live the life of the swingers, we are the Senators, the Chairmen, we are the rulers of life as you know it. We have transcended your pitiful existence, and control every aspect of your very fate, without you even so much as noticing. By now, we have the money and the power, and as Scarface once said (We know you love him, and have his poster on your bedroom wall,'cause you're cool like that) next we get the women. And guess who it is that loves power, as you said women do? That's right, it's your little skank of a wife! Now, most of us will likely have settled down with a wife, but I'm sure there are plenty that would be glad to take your wife when she dumps your sorry ass to go to the people she knows have the real power. And, as we get older, our fortunes and power will grow. We'll eventually get a few trophy wives, settle down a bit, and live in the lap of luxury. Meanwhile, you, the "Alpha Male" will be left alone. By the time you hit thirty, your primal attraction, your ONLY asset, will begin to fade. Your third wife in ten years will grow tired of your old, pitiful body, and will leave you. Stuck in a dead-end job as one of our pawns, you will grow old and even less appealing. Eventually you will die an old and unloved man, either by taking your own life, drowning yourself in booze, or perhaps merely out of your own misery. So go ahead. Brag about how many women you are ***ing. Call us losers. We may seem to be upset, and you may mock our pain, but I assure you, we know your fate. And we are smiling inside. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Found Some Dharma in Meshuggah Lyrics (Metal Band) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-17 20:54:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This band is pretty praised for their very well crafted lyrics, so I decided to actually look into the lyrics and found a lot of explicitly dharmic ideas in their album "Catch ThirtyThree". The band is heavy metal (and very strange heavy metal at that) so it will probably not be enjoyable to everyone. Anyway here's the album that I found a lot of the content from  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7HHEWsWKZU list=PLZnw-eYMBLSw4oET4L1v30DFzlftiOEhb  
  
Some notable lyrics:  
  
From "Inprint of the Un-Saved"  
The scattered jigsaw of my redemption laid out before my eyes  
Each piece as amorphous as the other - Each piece in its lack of shape a lie  
  
From "Disenchantment"
I stay my breath to escape this slavery  
I stay my breath to re-awake and face it encore  
The struggle to free myself of restraints, becomes my very shackles  
  
From "Re-Inanimate"  
My ignorance cast in the mold of all things absolute  
I sustain forever my gaze. A stare fixed on the distant oblivion  
Resting in the inverted state of being dead, non-sensory matter  
As all the earth, the wind, the fire, the sea behold and learn to pity me  
  
From "Entrapment"  
Mutiny of self. Insurrection games convincingly performed  
Incapacitated by physical thoughts acting out the will of tendon and bone  
  
From "Mind's Mirrors"  
The feeding frenzy of my starving soul, gnawing voraciously at the bones,  
the exo-skeletal patchwork protecting my own reflection within;  
The twin-and-same engaged in the mirrored act of chewing away  
at the shell of my attacking self. The paradox unseen  
  
Treacherous this deceit to make no choice matter  
To have and yet lose yourself, until finally all reasons why are forgotten  
To live through ones own shadow. Mute and blinded, is to really see  
Eclipse the golden mirror and the reflection is set free  
  
From "Shed"  
I float through physical thoughts. I stare down the abyss of organic dreams  
All bets off, I plunge - Only to find that self is shed   
  
From "Dehumanization"
A new level reached, where the absence of air lets me breathe  
I'm inverted electrical impulses. A malfunctioning death-code incomplete  
All things before me, at first unliving glimpse undeciphered  
Its semantics rid of logic. Nothing is all. All is contradiction  
  
From "Sum"  
Vision will blind. Severance ties. Median am I. True are all lies </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ankle Pain During Sitting Meditation </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-16 16:38:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been sitting regularly for about a year and a half now and I still haven't found a way to sit that is completely comfortable and doesn't result in some kind of worsening pain (usually in my ankles). For whatever reason, my ankles really do not like getting forcibly extended. I've tried sitting Burmese, quarter lotus, half lotus, and kneeling with a cushion under me. The kneeling seems to provide the least pain to my ankles but more pain elsewhere, particularly my inner thigh. The rest of the positions I feel I'm most mentally sable in but my ankles getting extended becomes unbearable and I'm not sure if they're becoming damaged or not. I have very minor scoliosis (like 10% or something like that) and I have a condition called squinted knee where my knees sort of face each other at 45 degree ankles, causing me to walk with my feet pointed away from each other if I want my legs to be straight, just in case either of these may be the cause of this ankle pain.  
So anyone have any suggestions? inb4 using a chair I cannot focus nearly as well sitting in a chair as I can in some kind of cross legged position. Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've studied Christianity, Taoism, Hinduism, New Age, Judaism, and more occult religions somewhat (Thelema, Anti-Cosmic Satanism, etc.) and Buddhism. I feel that they all offer really good moral lessons, however Buddhism and Taoism are the ones that feel almost foolish to deny when it comes to practice and learning. For example with Christianity, if you don't believe in heaven, the whole thing sort of just falls apart and you're left with trying to figure out realistic answers to *why* to do good things, which just brings you to Buddhist understandings. The outcome of the practice still requires faith yes, but the core teachings and understandings of Buddhism are much more rational and easier to find proof in in everyday life.  
  
Hinduism I also feel somewhat similar too (especially Advaita Vedanta) but it seems to be focused too much on ritual and less on how to actually arrive at the Truth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But they're both God and in thinking about how they can both be the same God we get an idea of an ultimate reality far beyond our understanding or ability to imagine that we can still experience or interact with, even if in a limited and small way. This idea is different from the God of Abraham who has a clear identity, desires, dislikes, et cetera.  
  
Read up on Kabbalah studies. Judaism believes God to be the same as how you described Brahman.  
  
According to Wikipedia:  
The nature of the divine prompted kabbalists to envision two aspects to God: (a) God in essence, absolutely transcendent, unknowable, limitless Divine simplicity, and (b) God in manifestation, the revealed persona of God through which he creates and sustains and relates to mankind. Kabbalists speak of the first as Ein/Ayn Sof (  "the infinite/endless", literally "that which has no limits"). Of the impersonal Ein Sof nothing can be grasped. The second aspect of divine emanations, however, are accessible to human perception, dynamically interacting throughout spiritual and physical existence, reveal the divine immanently, and are bound up in the life of man. Kabbalists believe that these two aspects are not contradictory but complement one another, emanations revealing the concealed mystery from within the Godhead.  
  
Also according to my friend who is looking into Judaic spirituality, nothing can truly be said to exist nor not exist, somewhat similar to Buddhism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never read the Dalai Lama's book but I really liked The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying. Some if it seemed a little too faith-based for me but all of it seems to be beneficial in practice. I would recommend to continue reading them but at the same time study general Buddhist concepts, or else some of the concepts you've been reading about may be misunderstood. For example, when Sogyal Rinpoche says how the Ground Luminosity is the "true Self", he does not mean this in the sense of a soul. Buddhists do not believe that there is Self, so take away everything we believe to be real and all you're left with is the way things actually are and the way "you" actually are, what Sogyal Rinpoche is referring to as the Self. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Read What the Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula, it's an incredibly good book on the core understandings and practices of Buddhism. Keep in mind that it will seem very different than The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, as that book is based in Vajrayana Buddhism (a more esoteric form of Buddhism based on teachings believed to be taught by the Buddha later in his life). Don't expect to find anything about the Bardo of Dharmata or the Ground Luminosity from Dr. Rahula, but it is a great start if you want to learn about Buddhism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Got into New Age spirituality from listening to Tool at age 18, then later moved on to Advaita Vedanta Hinduism before turning 19. My Asian Philosophy professor taught me Buddhism around then as well. I initially hated it but I couldn't figure out why at the time. A few months later I realized that it made me uncomfortable by flat out telling me that everything I believed to be true wasn't. So then once I finally let go of everything I believed to be true I quickly realized that Buddhism is the correct way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those "supernatural" things you listed aren't actually supernatural at all but are more based in logic.  
  
You may be familiar with the Buddhist notion of Anatman, that there is no Self nature in anything. So when we die, we're not actually dying, because there was nothing alive in the first place. You just go on thinking another body that isn't you is you like you're doing right now.  
  
Nirvana is just then the realization of this. The realization that nothing can be called "you" and you truly experience this state of no-Self, the way things actually are.  </TEXT>

On the one hand, the Buddha is an arahant, as is evident from the standard verse of homage to the Blessed One (iti pi so bhagav araha samm sambuddho ); on the other, arahants are buddha, in the sense that they have attained full enlightenment, sambodhi, by awakening to the same truths that the Buddha himself realized."

<TEXT> While righteous anger and retribution can be immediate fixes for a problem, it will not get rid of the existence of such a problem. For example, if there is someone bullying you and you fight back, a majority of the time the bully will stop bullying you and might even stop bullying people altogether. However, there are still going to be bullies, this was not fixed. Compassion on the other hand will stop bullying altogether. Teaching people compassion from a young age and throughout their life will eliminate poor ways at their roots. If someone is bullying you, attacking you, etc., the Buddhist way would be to be kind to this person, offer them help with whatever may be bothering them, show them what is good. There was a story a couple months ago about a black man who decided to become friends with KKK members. He would go to their meetings, have knives and guns pulled on him, have horribly racist things shouted at him, but he did not act poorly back. He sought to be nice to the members and treat them like who they are: regular people who just don't have correct knowledge. Because of his kindness, 200 members left the Klan. Not because he asked them to leave, he said he didn't do that, they just saw his kindness and realized that that is what is wholesome. Hate and retaliation does not have the ability to succeed like that. </TEXT>

- I'm definitely going to miss the s-pen though. I remember hearing rumors that the s8 and s8 plus were going to support it since there's no Note 7 anymore but I haven't heard that rumor in a while.

If you're looking for the easiest transition from IPhone to Android get a Google Pixel. If you're looking for the vast possibilities Android has to offer, get the s7 edge or  s8.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Read "In The Buddha's Words" by Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi. It's an anthology of the Pali Canon (the basic texts in all schools of Buddhism as well as being the central texts in Theravada Buddhism) with commentary and explanation by Bhikkhu Bodhi himself. It's a very long read, and the suttas can be at first a little annoying to read (there's A LOT of repetition) but overall it's really good and very informative.    </TEXT>

This has happened before but last time it was just the backlight that was out and somehow it fixed itself after a few days. Now the backlight is on but it isn't displaying anything. When I plug the laptop into a TV I can see everything, so I assume it's just a problem with the screen. I've tried resetting the display drivers and everything like that and none of that is working. I want to open up the back to see if there's maybe something disconnected. If I do that would the warranty be voided? Thanks! </TEXT>

EDIT: Apparently this used to be a setting in Textra but was taken out when Android prevented apps from controlling mobile data with Lollipop.

This is where the Dharmakaya comes in as it is the ultimate reality of the universe, one where all things are empty (even the Dharmakaya itself is empty). The other two bodies are bodies that one should strive for in order to help rid the world of suffering. That's how I use the bodies in my regular practice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry about that. In Vajrayana Buddhism (a very esoteric sect of Buddhism popular in Tibet) there is the belief in different states of being known as Bardos. The Bardo of Dharmata occurs after death, and a lot of crazy stuff starts happening. If you are unaware of what is happening, you may end up causing yourself to be reborn into a lower realm (hell, preta, or animal) or miss attaining Nirvana completely and not being reborn again. Being aware in this state means realizing the nature of the forms you are experiencing, which you must realize are all subject to these three bodies mentioned in the OP.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those not familiar with the iconography or can't tell from the picture, from left to right is Bhaisajyaguru (Medicine Buddha), Amitabha Buddha, and Shakyamuni Buddha.  
The Amitabha statue was the first one I got at a stand in New York City by Times Square. It was during a time when I was still exploring different religions to settle into and was torn between buying the Buddha statue and a Ganesha statue. Owning the Buddha statue gave me a lot of motivation to continue to look into the Dharma even when I highly disagreed with it. Good thing I persisted.  
  
The second one I got was the Bhaisajyaguru statue. I got it from a cheesy "Asian-stuff" store in Jersey that was just filled with a lot of dragons and New Age stuff. I asked the sales person if they had any Bodhisattva statues and he looked at me like I had two heads. I asked him instead if they had Buddha statues and he brought me over to their extensive Budai collection haha. Saw the Medicine Buddha statue off to the side with a tag saying Akshobhya Buddha. I also remember seeing a very nice Tara statue but I knew very little of Tara at the time. Despite how clueless that store was I would love to go back.  
  
The Shakyamuni statue I just received from the website Buddha Groove. I heard about it a while ago but never bothered to check what they had in store. Going on recently I saw this and for the price it was well worth it. The back has Om Mani Padme Hum printed in Tibetan.  
  
Just wanted to let you guys know haha.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In this Sutra the Buddha denounces a lot of what the "philosophers" believe especially in regards to discrimination. Is he just referring to those that study philosophy and is saying that the Dharma in the Lankavatara transcends philosophy or is he referring to a specific group of scholars at that time like the Hinayana/Theravada which I know Mahayana sutras often argue against? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly. There's a reason why the Buddha didn't just kill himself after attaining enlightenment. Now we know the Dharma and we have this amazing opportunity to practice it and teach it.  
Being born in the human realm is supposedly extremely difficult. Sogyal Rinpoche explains it as imagining an ocean the size of the universe. A sea turtle swims throughout this ocean and pops his head up every 100 years. Also floating on this ocean is an inner tube with a 1 foot diameter hole. The chances of being born a human are less than the chances of that turtle poking his head up through the inner tube. Best to take advantage of this life as much as possible as enlightenment in the other realms is immensely more difficult. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wasn't sure if I should post this here or on r/hinduism, however I already frequent this sub so I figured I should ask here.  
I picked up a copy of the Bhagavad Gita: As it Is (the Hare Krishna interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita) and at the end of the introduction there's a list of the disciples of Krishna beginning with Brahm and ending with the author of the book, however number 9 says Akshobhya. I've always known that Hindus consider Shakyamuni Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu/incarnation of Krishna but I found it odd that a celestial buddha would be mentioned as a disciple here. I haven't been able to find anything out by googling it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's probably a deal that the carriers make them. Like for example Verizon will tell Samsung "we'll stock your phone but only if you let us install some of our stuff on it." Apple on the other hand is big enough to tell the carriers "no" and the carriers have to comply or else they miss out on selling iPhones which makes them a lot of money. Google probably didn't let Verizon do anything with the Pixel since it was already very good for Verizon to be the only carrier stocking the phone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Vimalakirti Sutra features a layman named Vimalakirti who actually outshines all the Buddha's head-disciples and is an extremely proficient Bodhisattva. On the Theravadan side however, Bhikku Bodhi states in his book "In the Buddha's Words" that one must go into homelessness if one wants to attain enlightenment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just finished reading the Vimalakirti Sutra and it's actually pretty hilarious how much it shits on non-Mahayanists. Half the lines of the disciples that aren't Manjushri are pretty much "We're Hinayana plebs so we'll never understand Vimalakirti's wisdom nor have his powers."  
  
That being said I absolutely loved the Vimalakirti Sutra and highly recommend it. Even with the unecessesary shitting on Theravadans (I lean mostly Theravadan myself) it's what made this sutra so fun to read. It may have actually been the most fun sutra I've read yet from when all the disciples each bringing up accounts of when they got shut down by Vimalakirti to when Vimalakirti brings all the celestial bodhisattvas and their Buddha to his house. It also had a lot of good insight on non-dualism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What everyone has been saying about Maitreya is correct, however the existence of Buddhas varies between Theravada and Mahayana. Theravada Buddhism believes that Gautama/Gotama (also often referred to as Shakyamuni) was the most recent buddha, and that the next will be Maitreya once the Dharma/Dhamma is forgotten. Mahayana Buddhism believes in celestial-buddhas which are buddhas that exist in other locations around the universe. The most popular of these is Amitabha Buddha, which is the central figure of Pure Land Buddhism. Others include Akshobhya, Vairocana, etc.  
  
The definition of a buddha differs between Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism. Theravada Buddhism claims that a buddha is one who attains enlightenment without learning the Dhamma from someone else. Someone who does learn the Dhamma from someone else is called an arahant. Both arahants and buddhas in Theravada Buddhism are considered to be on the same level of enlightenment, although buddhas possess more supernatural powers. A bodhisatta is a future buddha, so Maitreya is a bodhisatta and Shakyamuni used to be a bodhisatta. This paragraph purely refers to Theravada Buddhism.  
  
Mahayana Buddhism believes that a buddha is one who is on the highest level of enlightenment possible, and becomes so by living as a bodhisattva (the Sanskrit variant of bodhisatta). A bodhisattva is one who became enlightened, attained Nirvana, but continues to stay in Samsara for the wellbeing of others. During this stay in Samsara, the bodhisattva's buddha-nature continues to be nurtured until eventually they become a buddha. An arhat (Sanskrit variant of arahant) is a being who attained Nirvana and leaves Samsara, thus not attaining as much enlightenment as a bodhisattva. Maitreya is still believed to be a bodhisattva, and there are many others such as Avalokiteshvara and Manjushri. This paragraph purely refers to Mahayana Buddhism.   </TEXT>

The galaxy s5's solution was to keep a flap covering the charging port. The s7 however is fine with you getting water inside the port, but just won't let you charge while there's water in there so the phone doesn't break. Wireless charging should work, and in the meantime just keep trying to dry out the port until it turns itself back on. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been reading this book lately and it's actually pretty good, it mostly revolves around preparing oneself to die and the reality of death. There's one passage however that talks about buddha nature  and describes it as being called God in Christianity/Judaism, the Self/Brahman in Hinduism, etc. When put like this, isn't this buddha nature then contradictory to emptiness and impermanence? The way he also refers to discovering the buddha nature and seeing it as being the "changeless" almost seems like it's being considered a sort of soul. Anyone care to shed some light on this? Everything I've read so far seems great but with all due respect I'm iffy about these claims. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm thinking of dropping meat and possibly animal products in the attempt to add good karma to the world. I understand the suffering that eating meat causes and the Lankavatara Sutra also gives a pretty good reasoning to drop meat-eating.  
The only problem is getting sufficient protein at a still inexpensive cost. I've read that beans, nuts, and grains such as quinoa are very good, however one article I was reading said that quinoa is one of the only ones that provides all the necessary amino acids that meat provides. I also don't want to make my diet revolve around soy as I've heard it increases estrogen-like hormones.  
Any advice for this transition? </TEXT>

Also, the screen size on the s8 plus is rumored to be 6.3" and everyone's saying that wouldn't be a problem because the lack of bezels will make it about the same size as the s7 edge. But wouldn't the screen still be much more difficult to reach across?  </TEXT>

Of course my post wasn't going to be accurate, I tried to sum up what takes libraries of books and years of practice and insight into two sentences each on a Reddit comment. Anyway you also seem to have a good understanding of the topic, and if you ever have to explain to a Redditor the difference between Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism hopefully you'll have better luck than I.

And you're right I don't know much about Vajrayana but would like to learn more about it so if you have any suggestions please let me know. I currently have The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying in my library but haven't gotten around to reading it yet. I have read though the an anthology of texts from the Tipitaka in a book called In the Buddha's Words by Bhikkhu Bodhi as well as the Lankavatara Sutra, the Platform Sutra, and the Milinda Panha. Thank you though for your critique and insight! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Theravada Buddhism is what is considered by scholars to be the closest to what the Buddha actually taught. It is the most "basic" of the teachings and focuses primarily on the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. The main goal is to attain Nirvana and therefore leave Samsara.  
  
Mahayana Buddhism is based on believed additional teachings by the Buddha after the teachings followed in the Theravada school. Many scholars, however, don't believe that the Buddha actually taught the ideas present in the Mahayana schools. These ideas include prayer, Bodhisattvahood, and Buddha-nature amongst many more.  
  
Zen (Ch'an in China) is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that focuses heavily on the nature of being as well as mindfulness in practice.  
"Zen does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while peeling potatoes. Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes." -Alan Watts  
It also focuses on the idea that some stuff just has to be realized and cannot be expressed by way of mouth.  
  
Another major school is Vajrayana Buddhism, which some believe to just be a Mahayana school while others feel it's an entirely different practice on its own. It focuses heavily on Tantric methods, i.e. connecting oneself to the external world similar to Hinduism. This is done through deity meditation and other esoteric practices.  
  
If anyone feels I am incorrect with any of these please let me know, I wouldn't want to give anyone incorrect knowledge and would like to refine my knowledge as well.

Pixel just seems very boring.  
Samsung still has Touchwiz lag on Snapdragon models.  
I'm on Verizon so the $400 phones are out.

<TEXT> However if you want people to have good morals you have to actually show them why it's good to have good morals. You can't just say "you'll get into heaven" or something like that because then when the individual stops believing in heaven or simply doesn't care then they feel there is no reason anymore to have morals. </TEXT>

If you see a chair, one is immediately going to recognize such as a chair. However, this is just conditioning, because if you were to try to figure out what exactly that particular "chair" was, you would fail. Look up the Simile of the Chariot for a run-through regarding a chariot. We are conditioned to recognize form as being the Self of an entity, just as much as we are also conditioned to recognize mind as the Self. Understanding that this is just conditioning brings us to anatta (absence of Self). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Read the book What the Buddha Taught, it highlights most aspects of basic Theravada Buddhism very well (I believe it also touches on Mahayana a bit). Buddhism is also something that you don't necessarily have to be open about as well, the point of it is to help yourself and to help others. If you yourself understand the Dhamma and live as such, then you will be receiving the benefits as well as others through your good deeds. I also suggest reading the Platform Sutra of Zen Buddhism, it's a different perspective on Buddhism than what is taught in the Theravada school and most Mahayana schools. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) Understand the Doctrine of No Self; you cannot be bothered if there is nothing to be bothered. Also try to limit the desire to not be bothered, this can be done by living by the Noble Eightfold Path.

2) Meditation isn't just sitting like a stone in silence focusing on your breath. Meditation is something that should be practiced at all times by understanding all the experience that arises in everyday life.

3) When one is enlightened, they may become an Arhat which means they will attain Nirvana at death and be freed from Samsara (the cycle of life and death). One, however, may choose to become a Bodhisattva upon enlightenment, which means they will continue to exist in Samsara in order to help rid the world of suffering. They will remain in Samsara until all beings have attained Nirvana, at which point they will then attain the ultimate Nirvana themselves. Mahyna Buddhism often involves praying to certain Bodhisattvas that are believed to exist somewhere else in the universe.

4) Cursing shouldn't be a bad thing as long as one is mindful of the meaning the words have and does not use them to incite anger or in other acts of malevolence. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How Does the Madhyamaka Philosophy Differ From Theravada Teachings? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-02 18:55:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From what I've read, Madhyamaka is one of the main schools of Mahyna that teaches a Middle Way between eternalism and annihilationism while teaching that nothing has independent, eternal nature which makes everything "empty" but not non-existent. I'm just confused on how this differs from what was taught in the Theravda teachings as I'm pretty sure a Theravda practitioner would agree with these claims of "emptiness". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Buddhism I feel is most simply explained through the Four Noble Truths, as the rest of the doctrine may be interpreted after obtaining thorough knowledge about these Truths. That is: 
1) Life consists of dukkha. Dukkha is often explained as suffering, but more closely relates to negativity and delusion. 
2) Dukkha is caused by desire and the belief in a Self which causes egoism. 
3) To get rid of Dukkha is to get rid of desire and the belief in a Self. 
4) Getting rid of desire and the belief in a Self is best done by following the Eightfold Path. 
Once all is understood, Nirvana may be reached and the cycle of birth and death will end, unless one desides to be a Bodhisattva in which case they will exist in a state of Samsara and Nirvana at the same time and stay here to help all other beings reach Nirvana. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What Does Om () Mean in Buddhism? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Based on my understanding, Om in Hinduism is a syllable for Brahman or the connection between tman and Brahman. I've seen it often used in Buddhism, however, sometimes as a symbol for peace and other times placed before mantras. But what exactly does it mean in the Buddhist context and why is it used? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just accept that the annoyances are there, don't try to fight them or push them away. Eventually they will not bother you anymore. Whenever I'm meditating in my room, my suite-mates tend to be talking loudly outside my door. Rather than letting myself get upset, I accept the fact that them talking is simply a part of my life, and eventually I don't even notice them anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism, one would believe that we are all the same thing, in that we are all the higher reality Brahman. The founder of this school, Adi Shankara, was actually criticized by many traditional Hindus for being influenced by Buddhism. However, in order to believe that we are all one, we would have to believe that there is this "one" constant entity that we all are. Buddhism would say that it is impossible for there to be a constant entity, therefore we are not all one because there isn't a "one" that we all are. The reason why Shankara was criticized for being influenced by Buddhism in that he taught that there is no individual Self, which Buddhism would highly agree with but would extend it to say that there is no Self to anything, including everything as a whole. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good question, one that I tend to think about often. The ultimate reality is one in which there is no Self to anything, everything is just a series of causal relationships. One instance brings upon the next instance, with nothing constant or independent/non-relational existing. The more good karma one produces, the more beneficial these series of causal relationships will become, and thus will help end the suffering of all sentient beings. One can still reject nihilism even when looking at life through the ultimate reality as there is still the production of karma which affects the path in which reality flows. The Doctrine of No-Self essentially states that no one has a constant, unchanging essence to them. That doesn't mean that beings cannot suffer, in fact the suffering would be caused by the conventional reality if anything as the belief in a Self to begin with is what leads to suffering. Buddhism is all about the "middle-way" between annihilationism and eternalism, that is that entities are neither eternal nor nothing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Buddhism makes the distinction between conventional reality and ultimate reality. It doesn't teach to completely let go of conventional reality, but instead understand the ultimate reality and it's presence in all situations while still living through the conventional reality. Letting go of one's Self is actually meant to be beneficial in compassion, as it prevents "compassion fatigue", a common occurrence in many care providers which makes one cold, hard, and impersonal. If one were to let go of the Self, then the suffering that may come along with extensive compassion will not have an effect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If a computer really tried to calculate something into infinity it'd run out of memory, despite how little memory running numbers uses (we're talking infinite numbers). So basically if a computer understands that the result of a calculation will result in an infinite sequence of numbers it will either set a cap or will simply not bother processing. For example, if u type a number divided by zero into a calculator, it simply won't compute it because the result will be infinite. However if it were to calculate an irrational number (like pi) it'll usually just calculate it enough for the result to be useful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hillary:
Positive: She has experience with foreign policy and seems like she would do a good job with moderating between Dems and Reps.
Negative: Her approach to campaigning (media backing and Super PACs) is shady.

Bernie:
Positive: Passionate and has a lot of good ideas and seems like he would do a good job getting those ideas done.
Negative: Too far left to appease the right wing spectrum leading to misrepresentation. Also is very avoiding of questions during the debates.

Trump:
Positive: Hard as nails and his social policies are appealing to the right whereas his economic policies are appealing to the left.
Negative: Runs his mouth too much and oftentimes seems like he doesn't have any real solutions and is running a campaign on rhetoric.

Cruz:
Positive: Well reflects the moderate right wing and has proved himself to be a decent speaker.
Negative: Seems like he would have trouble moderating with Dems and does not have enough power to push through them if needed.

Rubio:
Positive: Probably the most moderate candidate currently in the election. He's also playing a respectable campaign.
Negative: May be too wishy-washy when it comes to actually running from the oval office. </TEXT>
