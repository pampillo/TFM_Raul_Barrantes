<TEXT> June 2015. I was late in finding out an amateur porn star I liked got fired because she was taking pictures at her job. She was a secretary in Swiss parliament. In response the majority of the videos she had were deleted from the internet. There used to be like 200 videos with her floating around now there are probably just 20-30 around. That is what got me started. [Here is a link](http://gawker.com/government-worker-suspended-for-tweeting-amateur-porn-s-1617054646) to that story for anyone that wants to read further on that.  </TEXT>

The Brazzers, Bangbros, and Naughty America subs cost me 27.85 and I downloaded 7.59 TB of videos from those three sites. It was cheap in total I spent about $200 for all the videos.

<TEXT> The question came to me when lurking the section and feeling like certain ads don't belong in the transgender section. I had two thoughts. The first was why do some of the ads want only straight guys and are misleading in that they aren't trans. My thought on the misleading ad issue was they think that they can get away with it in that section because they think guys looking for trans women might also be into gay guys. Or something a little more discriminatory toward transgenders which I won't even say but it is possible as why the cisgender gay guy ads in the trans section don't get taken down. </TEXT>

With the 1,2,3,4,5,6 trains the people who control the trains know where they are and were able to implement those countdown timers you see in the stations.

<TEXT> 2.24 TB was 1398 of the videos. They have 7531 in total as of this post. I think it was a good deal. I don't really like a couple of their male actors. The Spanish kid who looks really young and Keiran Lee. So out of the 7531 maybe 2,000 had a chance of being appealing to me. Out of those I downloaded 1,400 which is still a lot. I have seen large parts of every video I downloaded.

I think if someone were to download the highest possible quality for every video it would be 10-12 TB. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No plans on revamping. Most of the cost comes from the drives. I haven't spent much in total on porn with subs being $5 or $10. I have a couple 4k videos. They are 12 and 14 GB but just like you I can't take full advantage of them. I only have 1080p displays. They are also too large per video. Brazzers files are so large because of the encoding. The corporation that owns them owns Digital Playground. Digital has the same video quality of videos with the 1080p being 1-2 GB a video. I am in to professional more than amateur. If I like a girl it is easier to find more videos with her or get a general idea of the quality of an upcoming scene featuring them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm actually still at JBOD. A friend gave me several of his 16 TB My book duo's he didn't need anymore. I store it on there for the offline use. I also have movies/games. That stuff is 14 TB. Brazzers doesn't have a daily download limit. You can download all there stuff if you have the time to do it. The only thing is their files are much larger than other companies. 1080p can be 4-5 GB a video. Evil Angel for example 1080p videos are 1.6-2.2 GB a video. It depends on company for my bangbros section I did that. For other companies I just do it by alphabet order like you saw in the Brazzers screenshot. It doesn't get annoying. I usally search by name and pic a random video. </TEXT>
