I regretted after because I put so much pressure on myself only to get no real joy in return. 

OP I think the only thing that matters is just getting a girlfriend. Being able to share your first time with someone you care about sounds a lot better. Please don't put too much pressure on yourself. It's not as big of a deal as you think it is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The whole birthday situation you guys went through with him sucks. The same thing happened to me also, but worse.

 Anyways, he handled this situation pretty poorly. If I were in his position, I would attend the party and hangout like any other friend would do. However, I would avoid you. Most people can't handle FWBs, especially guys. But we don't tell you so this kind of relationship doesn't end.

 You text each other all the time even after you hooked up for the first time and you expect him not to start developing more feelings for you? Things changed after you hooked up. If you slept with a random guy, he might try to ask you out and if you reject him then it's not as bad. But you guys were friends and that means more than you think. He's trying to ignore you because of this. At this point, I don't think I could side with either one of you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man, I really wish I was in your position. The things you have accomplished are phenomenal to me. I don't know if this is good advice but I'll give it a try.

 When you're in school, many students tend to make friends. But how exactly? Well I realized that many of us make friends through similar activities and school is the most convenient. When you're completely out of school, I'll admit it gets harder to keep relationships. I don't want you to worry about that though. From what you posted, you have everything in order besides more of a social life and you're only 21. If your friends left you because you have everything together, then forget them. True friends stay with you. 

Now, if you can't keep relationships for more than 6 months, it could be because your not that social, maybe due to work (?) or it might be your personality. I hope you don't take offense to that. Maybe it's social anxiety? I've had problems with gfs and friends because of my personality sometimes. I worked through it, but it took a little time. I checked out a lot of local places and went out often and it soon left me more comfortable in these places and got me talking to others. If you're not into that, find a club or a hobby that will involve others around you. Everyone gets lonely. I mean, just imagine a person moving to a new state or country, it's like they have to start over again. Try not to get discouraged,  you have a long road ahead.

 If you want to talk, feel free to PM me. </TEXT>

I took a pretty long break because I was interested in so many things like Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Physical Therapy. My Godfather is a very successful self-taught Web Developer who never went to college, however this was around the time the Internet was a pretty new thing. This kind of leaves me a bit less confident in finding a career because Web Design has gotten much more popular. I don't remember as much as I did back in High School and I'm a bit confused as to where to start. Any suggestions?

Edit: I appreciate all the responses! The reason why I said, "too late" was only because of me personally. I've been having trouble figuring out what I want to become. Also my friend and I were in the same Web Development classes when we were sophomores in H.S. but he stuck with it...I didn't. I got discouraged because many started early on as I did or earlier. I didn't know anyone who started later in life, so I apologize if I sounded like an idiot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 20 so I guess I'm still new to this but, the best part about being my age is the independence. I have say in what I do with my life. If I chose a path that people don't agree with, well that's on me.

 The worst part about being an adult (IMO) is, time. I didn't notice when I was in High School but time passes by so fast. I could have a fun day, busy day, stressful day and all of it still moves too fast. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're a fucking idiot. I understand frustration if someone doesn't follow advice. But don't expect someone with depression to just change their own life because of yours or others advice. You're like one of those types of people that say, 'well get off your lazy ass and do it!'. These types of people have everything the need right now. They don't understand how it feels. You can't sympathize with people who have depression because of this, and you're only thinking logically when giving "advice". Don't shame people with depression because you don't have depression. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We've been best friends for a pretty long time. We'd hang out all over the place. Every place that we would go, you would hit on all the girls and surprisingly, get every girls number. I never understood how you could be this great with women. So when you told me you were gay, I was really surprised but also very accepting. You told me that you felt like this for a long time and it made you feel like less of a human for holding back so much of who you were supposed to be. It didn't matter to me, you were my best friend and it didn't matter whether you were straight, gay, or bisexual, I knew how good of a person you were. Then came graduation. I was going off to college and you, I wasn't so sure what you wanted to do with your life. We spent almost two years apart, barely speaking to each other as time went by. Last week, I decided to message you on Facebook, (You changed your number without telling me) and I wanted to get some friends and I to come to your house so we could all catch up. We agreed to meet up in two weeks because of all of our busy schedules. "Cool." but before I could say, 'see ya later' you told me you were on hormones and said that you were becoming a woman. When you told me this, I was first shocked and then confused, I didn't know what to say. You started to tell me to call you a girls name and stop calling you, 'bud' or 'buddy' but to be completely honest, I'm not ready to do that. I'm not comfortable with your decision. I understand that you wanted this, and i'm not going to make you feel bad in anyway. It will take time for me to accept all of this. But right now, I just don't know what to think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. It's a weird feeling really. You never really notice a certain girl all that much and then something happens that allows both of you to talk. You realize she's really nice and once you're done talking, you feel pretty happy that you talked to her. You end up thinking about it a little more often then one should and during that time, you think about all the great things you noticed about her. Then for some reason you just form a crush. 

This has happened to me plenty times. I don't know if our problems are the same but I realized that the reason why I formed a crush on every girl I met was because I didn't really have much of a social life. I honestly just wanted more human interaction in my life. If this isn't the reason then I wouldn't call you desperate, I think that maybe you should just start looking for a girlfriend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I respect the wrestlers for being on the road for so long and performing, but to me it isn't a sport. It's more like a circus act. Mainly because of the story. Also the story is almost always the same. However this is not the reason why I dislike it. The fans, not all but some, are annoying. My brother watches WWE and never stops talking about it. I encounter other people that watch WWE and they're just as annoying. I mention any other sport like boxing or mma and get complained at. </TEXT>

Every year for the past ten years, I would go outside at night on the first day of winter break during or after it snowed and just stand in one spot (it was usually right outside my front door) and listen. I wasn't listening for anything particular, I just loved how winter could make everything so quiet. And no matter what time of day, it was always so bright, because of the snow illuminating everything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I ate chicken...a lot. 

Grilled or breaded, boneless or not, dipping them in Ranch, Honey mustard, Marinara Sauce, hot sauce. Sometimes I would order pizza with chicken on it. Chinese food would always have chicken in it of course. I would mix chicken in with everything, fruit, salad, you name it. I even ate leftover KFC on Thanksgiving. That was a sad day for me, I ate the chicken in my parents laundry room so no one would see me. I honestly had an addiction to chicken. All that's over now of course. 

I really love bananas now. I just hope I don't get as attached to bananas as I did with chicken. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whenever I saw that there were pics leaked online of Jennifer Lawrence and several other celebrities (that I'm not all too familiar with) I got excited. I think Jennifer Lawrence, Ariana Grande and Kate Upton are hot and so are the celebrities that I do know.

 When I seen the pictures I got 'ready' but for some reason I didn't want to. I think I was more curious than anything. I realized that these pictures don't really mean anything. I mean, I could put my hand over the face in the picture and they just become another woman from /r/gonewild. Oh and I also prefer video to pictures.  </TEXT>

I'd like to have sex at least every other day, especially since the relationship is quite new, but we both have things we're busy with all the time and we never really find time. Sometimes we hardly see each other. 

I wish I could give you advice but I'm not sure if I can. I'm not that experienced with relationships. And I'm sure you wouldn't want advice from a 20 year old guy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm depressed, I can finally admit that to myself. It doesn't make me feel good that I realized this. It feels as if I never got the weight off my shoulders, but just added more. And it is almost enough to pull me down, but I'm trying to keep my head up. In High School, I would get stressed really easy. The school work was sometimes hard to understand and whatever mistakes I made, I took to heart. The stress was so overwhelming that I would shut down. To make myself feel better I would play my Xbox and talk to friends. As the work got harder, the more I played around. It got so bad that I almost didn't care for school anymore. After graduation, I had no direction in my life, and I hated that. I'd ask myself, "Why? Why would I choose games over living my life the way I wanted?" Instead of trying to change that and move forward, I went back to my old ways. Doing this over and over, I started to regret the fact that I didn't take school more seriously, the fact that I could of gone to a better college. I always had the potential to do my work thoroughly, I just couldn't handle stress like others. And now, I'm just depressed, spending most of my days regretting the same thing since I graduated. I don't talk to family or friends that much anymore but I try to keep a smile when I'm asked if I'm okay. I use to hangout with friends and workout and actually have a job, now I sit in my room nearly all day, watching Netflix or Youtube, losing myself in someone else's life trying to forget just for a 'little while'. I barely have friends, I have no job, no car, I hate the school I go to, I rely on my parents for help even though I don't want it, I have problems dealing with my emotions and I don't have any real direction in my life. I know I could easily fix all of this, but I'm nervous, scared and confused. I feel alone and I need help. I'm not happy here anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't patronize me. I said one word. Honestly, from what you've said so far, it seems like you're the type of person that likes to be right, even if it means making yourself look like a complete dumbass. How could you possibly think you're right? Is it because this post was reposted somewhere else? Do you actually have full proof /u/OB1FBM's post was a repost instead of the other way around? And even if the other person that posted this original post and said, "I'm the actual OP, that post was a repost!" would you a believe him?

Let me ask you this, why are you doing this? This post was 4 months ago, what's your purpose here? All I wanted to do was see the most upvoted stuff on Reddit and I see your obnoxious comments. You putting other people down because someone called you on your bullshit. I don't know if you've heard but over 50% of the reddit posts are usually reposts and /u/OB1FBM's post is legit. You would know this if you were here when it was originally posted, also somewhere in the comments, someone put up a JPEG showing that he was on the banned list for sharing these pictures on Reddit. I think maybe you should spend a little more time 'investigating' before making such foolish assumptions such as this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Believe it or not this still works to this day. Whenever I would get bored, I would go to website source codes and just look them over on my laptop. Well one day my classmate comes over and says, "holy shit..how did you get there!?" I responded,  "I just right clic..." but before I could fully explain myself he already asked me if I was hacking. I just said that I was looking over source code because I liked to, I understood the code. I told him I wanted to be a Web Developer. 

He just walked off. A week later and everyone and their grandmother thought that I was a hacker. Everyone around me started acting disturbingly nicer to me. It was really weird. As the word spread more and more, I was approached by campus police, I explained my situation and they believed me. Not a big deal. Now just for fun I like to go on Hacker typer (a fake hacking website) and scare the shit out of people from time to time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had..I mean STILL have the same problem. After I got out of high school, a lot of my friends moved on to different things as well as I did and I found myself more alone than ever. My every day routine was, school, work, gym, and homework. And I'll admit, I loved it for a short while, but the daily routine was boring so I tried to see if I could contact my old friends. Most of them were busy or didn't respond at all. Still feeling lonely I decided to sign up for  a bowling league (I'm not suggesting bowling and I'm also not an old man just in case you're wondering - I'm 20 btw) now you may not like bowling so the thing I suggest is try to get involved with something, a sport, club or volunteering. You'll have fun and make friends I'm sure of it. Then once you get over some of the anxiety you get then it'll be a bit easier to approach other people randomly. Signing up for that bowling league helped me make more friends and I'm much more happier now.


Edit: If you still go to school, I have more advice if you'd like to hear it? Anyways, I hoped that this somewhat helped you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I have this problem myself. Earlier this year I got into a car accident with prior back problems, I thought I was ok from the accident, I was clearly wrong. When I visited a chiropractor,  he told me my pelvis and hip were out of place and a bit twisted and that my left leg was a half an inch shorter than my right. After being adjusted several times, the lower part of my back and body are almost back in place, but I still have leg problems,  especially in the morning, it's like a sharp pain in my lower back shooting to my calf. I hope I get fixed up as well as you did.

<TEXT> I've dealt with the same thing, well still dealing with it kinda, but when I opened up to people,  I found out that people are nicer than they may seem. When I was in class, I would try to speak up as much as I could without trying to sound annoying, doing this relieved anxiety for me. After answering or asking questions people became comfortable with me as well as I did and eventually the idea of just randomly talking to someone wasn't scary. If you aren't in school, I suggest trying to get involved with something outside of your house. I thought sports would be the best thing but I don't do well with most sports so i just started in a bowling league (I'm part of a family full of bowlers) these things have helped me gain more friends and kill most of my social anxiety. I hope this helps you like it helped me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because there isn't a reason to have 3 even if they get imbued somehow, the two swords he has without Kitesu has their own special value. With two great swords it seems the Wazamono graded kitesu will be the first sword to get replaced, and if Zoro wants to be the greatest swordsman he'll need a supreme sword. So I believe if he still wants to prove that he has enough luck to overcome the cursed kitesu swords and he wants to become the greatest swordsman he'll pick the supreme kitesu. Or if the story goes in a different direction,  the cursed kitesu he has gets destroyed because its grade is lower than his others and he finds a supreme sword or gets one custom made from a famous swordsmith. 


This is also an 'if' question so I'm not exactly sure what is going to happen I can only make opinions, deduce the ones that seem over the top, and come up with logical explanations to what will happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a hard question but I believe I would start from how many people are dying in a specific area and go from there. If the killings stay local that would be easier to find out who was doing it. Most serial killers like to watch a person die, especially If they don't have to get their hands dirty and some like to come to the scene of the crime. If I had advanced computer skills I could try to find out who has been looking up criminals because I mean how many people spend their free time just looking up local criminals? But if they watched the anime, that might be more difficult, they would most likely stay hidden and not go public seeing as that didn't really work out for light. Honestly I would know what to do if someone had a death note without seeing the anime, but with it, I'm not so sure unless I had better resources.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do I deal with my friend's toxic girlfriend? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-27 20:20:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Back story: My friend recently got out of a 2 year relationship. We hung out to get his mind off of her (will call her woman A) by going to see a movie with some friends (we're all 18 and 19 so we can't get into bars) he met this girl (woman B) and instantly connected with her. Since then we don't talk much, but when we did he explained that he dropped out of college because woman B asked him to and now they're moving in with each other. WTF?

Edit: I wish I could give more details but, I can't get much out of him, he pretty much cut contact with me and everyone that we're friends with. 

Edit 2: These are all good suggestions,  I appreciate the help. I recently talked to him and we're hanging out tomorrow, his girlfriend is coming along. Hopefully it all goes smoothly. 

Edit 3: I'll probably post an update tomorrow. If anyone else wants to give me anymore advice feel free to post here until then. </TEXT>

You say that Naruto wants to become Hokage for power and prestige, sure I can agree with that but he also wants peace, he has used his abilities to do that. Sasuke wants revenge against the leaf village and won't stop until the leaf village is destroyed. He even said at one point he did not care if he had to sacrifice his own body to Orochimaru as long as it served his quest for revenge. If he accomplishes all of this THEN he wants peace...using force just like Obito. Sasuke at this point really shouldn't be Hokage.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are multiple reasons. Sometimes It could be a sign of anxiety or a stress reliever. It could just be the angle of your foot. Like right now, my foot is hanging off of my knee and I'm just shaking my foot like it's nothing. Usually people with ADHD can't sit still so moving all the time is comforting. Sometimes I shake my foot before I go to bed and other times I shake my foot so I can stay awake depending on my environment of course. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I think when people think of Sharingan they get a picture in their head of the stage 3 Sharingan because that stage was seen more often than the first stage. Also, I don't really think they need to go into specifics necessarily because all of us Naruto fans already understand each other.

However, if it's too complicated to explain, details would help me and others understand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just picture Rock Lee having the abilities he has now and then suddenly getting the Sharingan. I don't think just because he has a Djutsu that he would give up on staying a strong and active taijustu fighter.  I mean look at itachi's taijutsu, he was able to fight Naruto in tailed beast mode using just taijutsu and stage 3 Sharingan. And Rock Lee's taijutsu is way better than itachi's taijutsu. </TEXT>

Edit: These are all great character picks!
 Just to be clear, the characters you pick are not natural users of a Djutsu. This is just combining their abilities with a Djutsu. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've gone through this before and the way I gained confidence was just by talking to people; men and women. But I didnt pick the women that I liked because I knew I wouldn't even be confident enough to speak one word to them. Talking with people gained my confidence but that doesn't mean I still didn't get nervous. Women notice confidence in a guy by the way he looks, his posture, eye contact and the way he talks. So when I asked a girl out, I dressed casually but made sure I stood out from the crowd, walked up to her with my back straight, I made eye contact with her and asked, "Hey - im going to -. Do you want to be my date? (This was a girl that I talked to before) Now if it isn't soneone you don't know try to introduce yourself the same way that I asked the girl out, good posture, eye contact, strong voice, and make sure to dress casual, you don't need expensive clothing but you do need clothing that isn't torn or dirty. I hope this helped a bit.

Also make sure to have a good hygiene, you don't want to smell bad when asking a girl out.

<TEXT> I have a short story and a couple of questions.

My little brother was molested when he was three if I remembered correctly. He was in his father's house when it happened but it wasn't his dad who molested him, it was one of his dad's friends. Apparently, from what I heard from my mom, him and his friends were smoking weed and when my brother's dad fell asleep, one of his friends went upstairs and proceeded to molest him. I don't know all the details. My brother is 14 now and he gets into fights and he yells at everyone, but when someone talks to him about him acting out, he puts his guard up and stays isolated from everyone else. When he does act nice to people, he hates when people give him compliments or give him things and I keep wondering, Does he act like this because of being molested at a young age? Or is he used to being put down because all of the trouble he has caused?

Also, I hope I didnt sound like a jerk to you or to anyone else, I just want to know why he acts the way he does. </TEXT>

Edit: Also, correct me if I got the whole "Without Danzo's orders Itachi wouldn't have gone on a killing spree" comment wrong. I'm a little fuzzy on the details but I'm for certain he is the reason why itachi did what he did.

Edit 2: I kinda fucked up my comment, was originally trying to say, "I think Danzo is the most influential person. Without Danzo's orders, itachi wouldn't have gone on a killing spree and that wouldn't of fueled Sasuke's rage to get revenge....which leads me to your answer Orochimaru. " </TEXT>

Oh and I also knew Kin'emon and Momonosuke were just getting a ride to dressrosa not joining the crew. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh the reason why he looks like a rogue ninja is just because of the eyebrows and just the face mask. The eyes are fine the eyebrows make him look angry. Either way, the picture looks great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I had to be completely honest. I like the picture. I get this feeling this character would end up being a rogue ninja (just from personal perspective) definitely keep it up you're doing great.

Edit: I also forgot to add that he kind of looks like nagato. And also don't mind the insults just keep doing what you do, just make sure to draw it a little smaller so viewers like me could see everything, other than that good job :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is sleep paralysis. I believe it's when you're REM sleep is disturbed and your mind ends up being partly awake and asleep at the same time. Also, you're body goes into complete muscle atonia which prevents you from moving when you're dreaming, hence the paralysis. Since you're partly awake and asleep at the same time, dreams or nightmares play a part in real life to you. Most people believe when they're in sleep paralysis that there is an intruder in their house. The majority of the it's just your mind playing tricks on you....However, I wouldn't rule out any other reasons why this is happening to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This happened a couple of years ago but one day I drove to my friends house after school. His mother opened up the door and greeted me, like usual, I said the usual things, "Hi how are you?" We talked for a little bit before I asked where my friend was and she said and I quote, "Probably either studying or fucking the next door neighbors daughter." I nervously laughed because she never talked like that to me and I said, "well can I just wait downstairs until he gets back?" And she just motioned to the downstairs. 1 hour later she asked if I  could come upstairs she had, "something for me to try" I came up and seen her half naked on the table with this weird lingerie on. She asked me if I was ever with an older women (I was 18 at the time) I didn't say a word and she pulled me over to her. We started to kiss and she started to undress.  At this point I felt nervous and scared and just really shocked this was happening. I ran out of the house w\o my things. I told my gf what happened and luckily she didnt break up with me. Also I got my things back after my friend brought them to school the next day. To this day I never stepped a foot in that house again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When Sai and Shin were born, instead of being given to their mothers they were taken away for "further examination" hours later they were presumed dead. (Note: they weren't born on the same day, this event happened on seperate dates but the same incident happened.) A organization (You decide name or pick name) took them in to run experiments. These experiments enhanced their ablities. (Mental and Physical) They were put with other boys who had the same experiments done to them. Now this story may seem a bit *much* but it's kind of hard to take their lives in Root and compare it to modern day tactics the U.S. would take to make combat machines. I hope this kinda helped, I wasn't sure where to start :). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thats what I believe. But those are also agnostic views too. I cant prove any "higher power" but I cant just say that it isnt true unless I get proof. How exactly can you tell me there isnt an afterlife when you cant prove it yourself? This is what makes me agnostic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely agree with you about atheism. I myself was an atheist and I was shunned for it. Every thing you said happened to me also. I studied mythology, went through hard times in my family, started to realize my increased intelligence in Hs. (mostly in science and math). I always thought when I was younger, "if god created the earth, who created him/her/it?" So as I got older I started to think this god was just an alien from anothet planet because logically how would a person just form out of nothing and have commen sense and the intelligence to create an earth so complex? So I decided to be athiest but since religion is traditional I decided to be agnostic in the sense of taking the side of science and saying to myself, "how am I so sure that there isnt something waiting for me after I die besides a hole in the ground? We don't know everything" And thats when I made religon 2nd. I have athiest views but stick to agnostic because I wonder a lot. And so my brother and some friends stop calling me a Satanist. (these people are fucking ridiculously stupid)

<TEXT> Why are you atheist exactly? See the only reason why most atheist are who they are is because the bible makes no sense. And it was created by man and not god. If god and heaven is real then whoever made the bible really fucked up and made god seem like a old Republican in a government building. Ill stick to being agnostic for now. How do you know for sure there isn't a "higher power". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I usually suffer from this every night. I dont necessary know if its a real demon or my mind is accessing my worst fears. Every night a piece of my clothing comes alive and turns into a rabbid animal (my face is in the direction of clothes basket) last night my boxers turned into a very small Wolf. It's actually quite funny just thinking about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At least your brain makes you do that instead of me being told to do things by my parents. They make me clean when I'm tired, dehydrated, working on college work, studying, coding websites, or being sick. And they still think I'm a slacker, when really I'm an introvert individual that keeps to himself so they pile more shit on me. I should just make a meme and stop bitching. </TEXT>
