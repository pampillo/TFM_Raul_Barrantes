<TEXT> I can't believe no one has mentioned that it's the same director as "TimeCrimes" such an underrated film that looks to be the same tone as this. Very excited! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I firmly believe it can stand on it own against films like, Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates, Full Metal Jacket, We Were Soldiers, Inglourious Basterds, Platoon, and Black Hawk Down. Not saying it's better than any of those necessarily, however it's just below these choices; clearly making my top 10 favorite war films.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed. I had very little interest when the trailer dropped, the "Help me get one more" line is nowhere near as cheesy as it is in the trailer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lots of severed limbs flying around, blood everywhere, maggots eating corpses along with rats, burning bodies, etc. If you want to compare it to something I would use the opening scene of "Saving Private Ryan" where you see the intestines falling out of the soldier. Very realistic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not the religious type and i never felt like it was blatantly hitting you over the head with it.  A few visuals that resemble religion and the main character prays but other than that it does not throw it in your face and respects you as a viewer. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just Got Back From "Hacksaw Ridge" Early Screening </TITLE>

<TEXT> I just recently got back from an early screening of "Hacksaw Ridge" and holy shit this movie is amazing.  Its honestly one of the best war films ever made and is also one of the best films of the entire year.  It manages to be a love story, courtroom drama, horror film, and a thrilling war movie.  Ive never seen war depicted in such a horrific way since the opening of "Saving Private Ryan", and this film may have managed to even outdo that one in the gore department.  From the trailers I thought I would dislike Andrew Garfield's performance and accent, but i was proven wrong and i believe he really did a great job, along with Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington.  I highly recommend this film to everyone especially if you're looking for a new classic war movie and aside from some pacing issues towards the end its a near perfect movie.  9.5/10 </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the best PG-13 horror film to come out in some time. Solid 7.5/10. Entertaining all the way through with believable characters and motivations, and the last act is one big 20 minute scare fest. However some of the decisions made we're standard horror cliche mistakes, it's easy to look past them. Would highly recommend, theatre experience was god awful though.  </TEXT>
