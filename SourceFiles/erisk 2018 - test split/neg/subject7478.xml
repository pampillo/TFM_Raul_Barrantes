<TEXT> I broke my nose working as a computer technician.

The company had built a second floor into their office and, rather than build a proper set of stairs, they took a set of stairs on wheels and attached them to the upper floor. They then cut the top rail off, leaving the bottom rail for stability.

On my first week on the job, I was very carefully carrying a customer's computer up the stairs for repair. And I forgot about the bar. Tripped over it. Computer landed upright on the ground. I landed on the computer. Face went completely numb.

Ended up in the bathroom, face still numb from shock, and had the foresight to put my nose back in place while I still couldn't feel it. At which point my coworker almost threw up, and asked me to take the rest of the day off.

Still have a little dent, right in the middle of the bridge, to this day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the part that's often not spoken about is how hard it is to get over being overweight in your mind. I spent a lot of years at near 400, and people would often say "Its not that bad" or flat out "You're not fat, stop saying that about yourself"

From people I've spoken to, I think the getting over "being ugly in your mind" is the hardest thing to do. I question if I will ever feel as if I look fantastic. But I'll hopefully have many extra years to work on that, thanks to the changes I've made now. </TEXT>

I went and watched it again today. What they thought was the Dragonzord was actually Goldar. The green flash appears to be when Rita leaves Goldar's chest to attack the Ranger thats in the dream sequence. I also think that the fly over at the beginning is actually Zordon's ship crashing into Earth. Could be wrong about that though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only problem with that theory is that These Were The Voyages was written as a series finale. As far as I know it was written years in advance with the intention of having it wrap up however many seasons they got. So even if they got 7 seasons, Trip would still die in the last episode. That's why it's written for their tenth year in space, as Enterprise comes home to be decommissioned.

Could be wrong, but I read about it in a magazine when Enterprise wrapped up, it was supposed to be a Valentine for the fans of all star trek. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey everyone! I've been using my Simple Metal for just over a year. This weekend I completed the XYZ upgrade from Matrix Precision. The install went perfect. I changed the X and Y for M211 (the wires aren't long enough for the Z axis, so I'll have more work ahead of me there)

I also increased the X and Y size in Cura. But, every time I do a print, it does its probe (at which point it is properly to the outer edges as I would expect)

When it starts to print, however, it starts printing near the middle of the bed. So, if I'm doing a print thats larger than 5 inches, it hits the right edge of the bed and starts grinding the belt.

I'm at a bit of a loss to explain it. I've posted my printer settings bellow in case I'm an idiot and miss something obvious.

<TEXT> So, super weird issue. Not sure if anyone is using this much. I basically am trying to get a wired button to trigger a return to main menu. I launch mario, and I try to trigger select/start from inside the NES emulator.

Here is where things get weird. Select works on the main menu of Super Mario Bros. Start works on the main menu too. But, once the game starts, pressing start using the GPIO doesn't pause the game. But, if you kill off mario 3 times and get back to the main menu, you can use the start GPIO to start the game again, and select to change between 1p and 2p.

Not expecting there will be much anyone can do to help diagnose this, its very weird. GPIO input also works on the main menu for RetrOrangePi.

Very very odd. </TEXT>

orangepi_PC_gpio_pyH3-master

From this folder, I run 
sudo python setup.py install

sudo service tz_gpio start

which complains that there is no tz_gpio.service 

I'm not very strong with my linux commands, so I'm not sure where I am going wrong.

This month I received a USB hub that looks like a mini Sega Genesis and couldn't help but think... That thing is probably mostly hollow and would probably have plenty of room for an Orange Pi One in it.

About twenty minutes later, I had drilled a hole for power and cut and filed a hole for HDMI. Some hot glue action secured the board in place and we are off to the races.

So far it doesn't seem to be running overly warm, after a nice long NES session. Super happy with how it turned out!

Sorry about the messy photos... Doing a bunch of remodelling and took a break for this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Slightly shorter than you, went from 398 to 274 in a year. You can do it, 5 years in plenty of time. Just gotta get yourself into it. 

I started small, I found a gym I was comfortable going to and started going twice a week. Then 3 times. And I cut out all sugar drinks. Over the course of 5 months, I trimmed out deep fried food, and brought my calories a day down to about 1850.

In June I transitioned into doing low carb. Eventually I increased my gym visits to 5 times a week. The most important lesson that I can convey is that don't try to do it all at once. If you do, you are likely to burn yourself out. Find rules you can live in now that get you started, then change them as you get comfortable. And remember that it's going to be 90 percent food and 10 percent exercise. Fitness helps strengthen your body and make it run better. But it can't make up for really bad eating habits.  

If you have any questions, feel free to hit me up. I love to help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the control board it's simply sandwiched between the plexi and the mdf. Around the screen, it's secured with double sided tape. Around the marquee, I repurposed some plastic molding I found at the hardware store that I believe is used in drywalling. I installed it with brass screws, as I did not trust the double sided tape to hold the weight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha yup. I was 30 when I started, too. I had deluded myself into thinking I would be done by end of year. It's almost never as fast as you think it will be. But, as you say, 30 years of debauchery traded to 2 years of self repair isn't a bad trade.

So far, I have gone from a tight size 60 waist pants to a loose 48 - 50. And shirts from 5x to 3x. Most of my size progress has been since June. So now I am hoping XL by the end of the year.

<TEXT> At the end of last year, I stepped on a scale with a weight limit of 400 lbs,  and it read error. I decided I needed to do something about it. So I made gradual changes. Two weeks later, I stepped into it again. 398. So now, 10 months down the line, this morning the scale reads 309.

It's possible to do it. It's not easy. It can be fun. I just wanted to say, as someone who is 9 months further along on a very similar journey... good job. Keep it up. It's worth it. And we can high five at the finish line. </TEXT>

And am trying to find a magnet or a vinyl sticker that covers the entire front of it and gives it an 80's/90's video game theme. Wondering if anyone has seen something like this anywhere? I'd prefer to get something that arrives ready to apply without too much modification.

<TEXT> Hey there...

Firstly, I think you may have some misinformation. The SuperFX chip was an additional chip added to Some 3d intense games to give them some new abilities that the SNES didnt have out of the box.

That being said, you have a dead snes on your hands. What seems to be all the rage right now is ripping out the internals.and tossing either a very small windows pc or a raspberry pi into it. Then you can load it up with emulators and have everything in one spoT.

Bonus points for setting it up to use original snes controllers. Www.retrousb.com sells solderable usb to snes controller boards, so you could hook that up to the original controller ports.

Finally, consider if you want to to look stock or give it a themed paint job!

Hope this helps </TEXT>

I have tried all the front ends out there. If you like to leave your cabinet running and looking pretty when not in use, HS is nice. Different strokes for different folks. I don't use HyperLaunch though. Launching exes directly eliminates possible interference.

<TEXT> A special offer!
For those of you who missed ReBoot season 3 and have no idea whats going on...

Ahem...
The web invaded Mainframe
Sprite and virus battled side by side
Attempting to reclaim the city
From the rift that opened wide
But Megabyte betrayed Bob
And he threw him deep inside the pit
The pit was closed
And Bob was hosed
And all that he could say was
Noooooo!
Without Bob to protect us
We thought we would have no barrier
From he who would infect us
Except Enzo, which was scarier
The city trembled terrified
From fear of the infectors touch
I guess your fears were verified
I wasnt a protector much

I guess our fears were verified
He wasnt a protector much
I guess our fears were verified
He wasnt a protector much
I guess our fears were verified
He wasnt a protector ector much

It wasnt Enzos fault at first
He only was a little sprite
At best he was the worst
But then he slowly learned to do it right
And just as he was getting skilled
A game came down he couldnt win
I thought for sure theyd both been killed
First Bob and Enzo not again

I jumped from game to game I aged
I grew and lost my innocence
I soon became enraged by each and every bad experience
the sprite you knew was gone
I had become a grim agressor man
I knew from that point on
That I was truly Bobs succesor man

I met up with the webriders
and took the form of interface
I joined my gun with pirate swords
And surfed the seas of cyberspace
and when at last the two of us
were really reunited guys
our shouts of joy did blare
Because we really were delighted guys

We soon made tracks to Mainframe
So our friends could reunited with us
We made it back but Megabyte
Was waiting there to fight with us
When Bob went face to face to face with Hexidecimal
Our chances for survival shrank from small to infintecimal

Bob helped to defragment my head
While Matrix fought with Megabyte
I thought he'd wind up dead
But he put up a terrific fight
I dreamed of this each lonely night
Of doing in this virus trash
But just ad I had won the fight
He engineered a system crash

What Megabyte had hoped to do
Was cause his death to crack us up
I gambled on the user to Reboot
And thereby back us up
It worked, we all were born anew
And rid of things barbaric
And now we're back together
Everything's alphanuemeric
Everything is alphanuemeric! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately, it was all sort of done in my head. I can tell you that the entire thing was built out of a 4 x 8 x 3/4 piece of maple cabinet-grade plywood, with a sheet of 2x8x5/8 shelving MDF. I started by cutting two panels from the ply. The sides are 24 wide, and the ends are 19. This left enough for the sides of the control panels.

After that, I measured out my controls and found out that I wanted to go about 20" including the sides for the long control panel.

Once the sides were cut, I did the routering around the edges to create the slots for the t-molding. Then I stained everything. I screwed through the sides into the control panel sides, and added metal corner brackets on the inside for safe measure.

The trickiest part was the trackball. I didn't realize when I ordered it that it was going to be flush mount. For it, I cut a hole in the mdf the size of the body of the trackball. I then flush mounted it with the top, and put a piece of plexiglas over top of it.

The assembly is powered by an AMD Dual-Core 2.6ghz with 2gb of ram and onboard Radeon VC. Its running Hyperspin and I added all the video and marquee files so that the games she adds will automatically have the logos and such.

If you have any more questions, I'd be glad to answer them. The other thing is that, while it seems to have 4 sets of controls, its actually two duplicated. She wanted to be able to play games from both orientations, so I split off each of the connections so I could wire two controls to each of them. It worked well, and made configuration very simple. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My name is the same as a famous director. Every time he puts out a new movie, people ask me if I realize this. Or tell me they love my movies. Even when it's bed years since his last movie, I still get it. 

It got so bad at one point that I had a guy who works for Rogers in Canada start cracking jokes when I had called in to complain about an incorrect charge on my bill. Soon as he saw my name on the account. Said something about I should be able to pay for extra charges since I made millions off my movie. I just about lost it on him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was 16 I tripped carrying a computer up a flight of stairs at the repair shop I was working at. I caught the computer in the face on the way down and broke my nose flat. The amount and speed at which it bled was downright frightening for someone who has never needed so much as stitches before. 

The most interesting thing is, my mom insisted we go to the doctor, even though I had set my nose back and the bleeding was stopped. My shirt and pants were severely covered in blood. After waiting for hours for the doctor, he looked at me for a few seconds in my blood stained clothing and asked if there was any bleeding. Then he grabbed the bridge of my nose, twisted lightly until he heard the crunch, and said "Your nose is broken. Seems like it's set right. Nothing to do here."  I know they don't do anything for broken noses, but his observational skills left me feeling less than in the best of hands.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Moreover, it is clearly not the Enterprise. They imply it is by showing the big E in an orbital decay, but if you examine the ship that hits the Earth, you will find that its nacells are squared instead of round. Its secondary hull also seems to be set higher in. Based on the impact, I feel it is likely this scene ties in to the original attack on London, which takes place towards the beginning of the film. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't for anything food related, but still kind of relates to rediculousness.

When I was working as an acting supervisor for a cable company in new York, I had an escalated call come in from an irate customer. Guy says "Yeah... We just ordered this UFC fight on pay per vue. Its not being offered in HD in our area. I think we should be getting a discount, and toss in HBO and a few movie channels for free for a few months for our inconvenience."

So I politely explained that the event was only in SD (this was years back) and that we had no control over what the provider gave us as a feed. I also told him that, if he was unhappy, I could cancel his order and he could choose not to order it. He persisted, saying that this phone call is a huge inconvenience and that a few months of premium channels is the least we could do (the UTC event was 49.99, and he was asking for approximately 90 dollars in free service over the three months). 

Finally he blurts out "My friend spends a lot of money with you every month, you really should be more accommodating". Turns out he isn't even the account holder. He had lied to my rep when he called in because the account holder was too drunk to talk but thought his hilarious negotiations skills were too good to miss.

The best part? I am still on the phone with him when the right starts (standard no hang up on customers policy... although I can't garauntee he was a customer of ours anyway) and he suddenly blurts out "Well fuck you. Fight is starting. But I promise this isn't over" then puts the phone down off the hook. Hear him say "Let him eat air for a bit. Two hours to of hold time should straighten him out" luckily at that point, I was able to wait two minutes, inform our QA group the customer has become unresponsive, and disconnect.

Also, I had  guy call in wanting me to discount his porn and give him phone sex because his TV cut out during his porn, and his boyfriend was asleep and he didn't want to wake him. </TEXT>

After waiting for 5 minutes to be seated, I got tired of waiting, and went and sat at a booth. I waited again for over an hour, and the waiter never came. I tried clearing my throat, making noise, nothing. After an hour and a half, I realized the place was closed.

tl;dr There was a reason this restaurant didn't have anyone else in it! </TEXT>
