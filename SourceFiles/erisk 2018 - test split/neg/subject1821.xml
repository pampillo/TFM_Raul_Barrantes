<TEXT> You should look into bankruptcy. First you will need to get your parents off of your loans - you can do that if you paid your first three years and didn't take any deferment. Once they are off, just stop paying the private loans. If you declare bankruptcy the private loans would be wiped out but you'll still have to pay your Federal ones (probably much less expensive). 

Do the math, you will never undig in a meaningful way from that debt load. While you bear some of the responsibility, the private loan companies partook in bad loan practices (think mortgage lenders circa 2006). 

Good luck - totally sucks but there options.  </TEXT>
