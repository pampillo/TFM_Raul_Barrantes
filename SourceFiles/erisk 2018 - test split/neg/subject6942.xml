Muslims from all over the world rejoyce and a mass emigration to Floristan begins... Doesn't take long before Floristan get kinda cramped. "I know", a wise man says, "lets just occupy Georgia, it's already aptly named!" So forth and so on, you get the picture?

What would the average American do? Surrender to sharia law, or stand up against occupation? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure how the rest of the world deals with it, but if you think about how many dead people there are (and how many are still to come) it's impossible to give every single one their own gravesite.

When you stop paying for the plot they dig up the remains, store them with all the other exhumed remains and then re-bury them in a designated mass-grave or cremate them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just a little update to those of you that talk of respect and letting the dead rest:

I'm not sure if you are aware of this, but when someone is buried, after the coffin is lowered and people have left, they use an excavator to crush the coffin before filling in the grave to prevent it from collapsing later.

Here you also only own a grave for 20/25 years (unless someone keeps paying for you plot. If not, you'll be exhumed and the remains cremated. Exhumation also occurs if a relative is laid to rest in the same plot as a familiy member that passed before them.

I do not feel photographing dead bodies is disrespectful. They were not disturbed in any way, just immortalized. I know this is a touchy subject, but if you guys knew what goes on in morgues/graveyards, you wouldn't call what I do disrespectful...

Thanks. </TEXT>

Sadly, I believe man created God, not the other way around. We are the closest to God we'll ever get... We have the power to change the world, yet we rather argue about everything on the internet instead.

Hail humans, destroyers of ourselves! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Neither. They both tried. But failed. What you humans fail to understand that God is not an entity, we are God.

As humans, you have the ability to think, to have compassion and understanding. What you call soul or spirit is really just you.

And as Gods, humans should act accordingly. Jesus didn't want organized religion... As soon as there is power to be had, it will be abused.

End religion as we know it. Be kind to one another. One love.

Peace out. </TEXT>

What we are looking for: - Attacks on oil-tankers and ships - Persian Gulf footage - Interviews Bonus points for anything with Norwegian ships/sailors/etc.
Help a fellow out? You can email me at beren666(at)gmail.com </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-05-17 22:20:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello!

I'm working on a Campaign that takes place on a small island just off the coast. I build two villages from the ground up, and populated them with custom NPCs. All was well until I started the second quest in the series... You start out in a shady tavern, and meet up with one of the NPCs from the first quest. 

My question is: Is there a way for me to save/import custom NPCs from one quest to another? Or do I have to rebuild the entire stable of characters in every singe quest if I want recurring NPCs? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there! I spent the better part of three days on a funny little quest, but every time I try to play through the quest my character spawns beneath the floor and falls to his death beneath the crypt... I've even raised the spawn point to 100 feet above ground, still he spawns beneath the floor. No matter where I put the point either... Same thing happens. 

Got a solution for me? </TEXT>
