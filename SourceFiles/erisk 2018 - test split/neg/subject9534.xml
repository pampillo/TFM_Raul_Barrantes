<TEXT> I'd go with the TGT (tight) wallet. I've had mine for over a year and it's taken hella of a beating. But after putting some redwing boot oil on its good as new. And for $36 I think I got more than my money's worth out of this product. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was 5 or 6 and was around 1 in the morning when I experienced it. I remember waking up for no reason and looking around the room half asleep. The room, lit by my night light and television, had this weird feeling like something was scolding me. I saw this thing in my doorway that looked like a 7 foot man but its body was completely pitch black. I Remember blacking out and having a lucid dream than waking up than being forced down in the bed by a pressure in my chest. After that night I always felt like I was being watched in my bedroom so keeping the lights on at night was what put me to sleep. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, a couple of years ago my grandpa gave me a bunch of his old knives. Recently I was scrolling through the internet and learned the name of one of the knifes, the Benchmade Spike. I can't find anything about the knife besides the creator of the design and that it discontinued a while back. Can anyone tell me more about this knife?
