<TEXT> this is a great illustration of film making vs. "like-mining." while the first video is a well-crafted piece of storytelling, the ripoff version was clearly made to just get likes on youtube. the thing is, the person who made the original video has a clear understanding of film making and film language and will be able to continue to make successful videos with creative ideas behind the stories and artistic choices. the person who ripped it off, clearly has no idea how to make a film and will not be able to make another without ripping someone else off. it seems easy to just rip off a video but without understanding film language you just end up with a piece of shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One evening, when I was around 8 years old, my dad took my brother and me to a store in Toronto called The Silver Snail. It was basically the coolest place on earth as far as I could tell. Lots of comic books, Transformers, obscure action figures, etc. I went out front to look at the awesome window display. A few minutes later I hear "Do you want me to buy something for you?" I turn around and there's a man, mid to late 60s, leaning in to talk to me. Instant gut tremor. "No thanks" and I immediately go back inside the store. A minute later, as I'm looking at something in the store, I hear "Are you sure you don't want me to buy you something?" Same guy. I noped the fuck away from that guy pretty fast and back to my dad. Pretty sure my gut reaction saved me from a lifetime of therapy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I met him at a stuffy Juno Awards party at a hotel in Toronto like 15 years ago. It was a room mostly filled with people in black tie, passed hors d'oeuvres and general fanciness. I was just sitting there when I smelled pot. I stood up and looked around to see who the fuck is smoking pot at a party like this. He just laughed, made a witty comment about my sudden smell-pot-stand-up motion and passed me the joint. Suddenly I was in a smoking circle with him and Alannah Myles. Good times. </TEXT>

"Uplifting News" followed by "Not The Onion" (these two shows, back to back, would alone make it my favorite channel).

"AMA" would obviously make a great talk show.

"Ask Science" 

"Damn That's Interesting"

<TEXT> i'm a big fan of the classic:
multiply any number by 9 and the sum of all the digits in the answer always equals 9 (when you keep adding the digits to the point of having only 1 digit obviously). even works with decimals.
eg. 113.9486 x 9 = 1025.5374 - add that shit up and get 27 - 2+7=9

<TEXT> When I was in my 20s, some friends and I used to call into a college radio show and talk shit. They would put us on air because we were pretty funny. Mostly we were a bit drunk and really high. One week, the regular hosts of the show weren't there and they had a couple newbie guest hosts. We called up and convinced them that we could hear ourselves on air even though they didn't put us on air. We then had a friend call and make a song request. Then we called back and were like "we totally just heard that girl's song request on air." They freaked out and thought they were having technical difficulties that were way beyond their understanding but really they just had a few dick listeners. I guess I don't actually feel too bad about it now but I did feel bad for a week or two. </TEXT>
