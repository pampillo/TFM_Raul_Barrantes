<TEXT> I'm not taking it seriously, I swear. I really liked it. Laughed a lot.

Just trying to explain the story to a non-comic/sci-fi fan made me realize how crazy the plot was. I never said it sucked or anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really liked the movie. I wasn't criticizing the film for not following science or our physics... I was just trying to break down the story in simple terms for my fianc that I realized how nutty the main storyline isespecially for people not "in the loop" so to speak.

Understand, when it comes to hard sci-fi and comic book lore, my fianc is a total layman. So ideas and concepts that comic book   sci-fi Fans readily understand and accept are not exactly intuitive for her.

Upon further reflection... The character of Ego (in the film) seems VERY emotionally immature for a being that is millions of years old. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is crazy!

I was talking to a friend of mine who writes fantasy... It's amazing how the modern cinema audience has changed. Fantasy is almost mainstream, and the "deep" comic book stuff is showing up more often.

I don't think a character like EGO would have even been accepted by film audiences 15 years ago. But now... We've been primed and we're more open to the concepts.

It is a good time. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I realized that Guardians of the Galaxy 2 has an absolutely absurd plot when I tried explaining it to my Fianc... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 13:47:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After watching GOTG2, my Fianc admitted thatalthough she liked the movieshe didnt really understand what was going on at any given minute with the plot. And, to be honest If you dont have a background in Sci-Fi or Comics You might not intuitively follow the story of GOTG2. So when we got home, I explained it to her in brief

Kurt Russell is a giant, humanoid brain whoafter years of solitudegot lonely being the only celestial and created an entire planet around himself, then converted into human form to study life elsewhere, at which time he became disappointed with all existing life and started sowing tiny plant bits of himself on various life-sustaining Worldswhile simultaneously romancing and impregnating a variety of different females (?) throughout the Galaxy so that at a later point in time he can befriend and join forces with one of his own celestial bastard children, hopefully be able to gain said bastards trust so he can lure them back to his planet/body, gauge their genetic strength, and if they prove capable, convince them in a few days time to help him eradicate all life everywhere through the destructive force of planetary Ego blobs.

It was at this point that I realizedalthough I still really like it Its fucking absurd.

They even dust off the old Death Star trick Ego is super-smart and all powerful, but he left himself vulnerable to attack by a small creature with a bomb. Fuck. Off.

**RANT MODE ACTIVATED:** AND, Im sorry but Behind the fuckin Dairy Queen? Really? Thats where you hid your planet-killing Blob-Flower?? Really, motherfucker??? How about, pick a REMOTE spot on the planetlike, oh I dont knowANT-FUCKING-ARTICA to plant your shit so some little kid doesnt run behind the DQ and stomp on it. But apparently in movieland, the small area of trees behind the local DQ remains undisturbed for 30+ years. If that was an Austin DQ, they would have leveled those trees and built condos behind that Dairy Queen in the late fucking 90s. **RANT MODE DEACTIVATED**

I still liked it. A lot. Its a testament to the strength of the characters and the comedy that we can all overlook the ridiculous plot line. Because it is ridiculous. </TEXT>

The TOP COMMENT by aced411 had almost 15 points yesterday and has been down voted to 6. Are these Crackle users who are downvoting him??

I had 6 points on my comment where I'm just asking other people's opinions... Nobody replied, but I've been down voted to 1.

What the fuck? There should be no downvoting of anybody here... We're having a very civil discussion.

This is why I fucking hate reddit and why I'm considering calling it quits. I get tons of Karma for fucking bullshit posts and comments, but when I try to engage in an actual exchange of information, I get downvoted. Fuck of, reddit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is interesting.

Haven't heard of Tubi until now. But I might give it a try.

How does everybody else feel about the CEO's comment?

I happen to think he might be right. Yes, I can save money by cutting the cord and paying for a subscription. But if I can get premium, quality content for free, that's even better.

And if I only have to suffer through 5 min of commercial content every 30 minutes (which is about 2.5 minutes less than Cable and Broadcast), then it's not really a big deal for me.

I will saywatching commercials during movies would annoy me. How does that work, Tubi Subscribers? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Takeover Dallas?? My man... I barely have time to finish Raw and Smackdown every week, let alone any PPVs. I JUST finished watching Wrestlemania for Christ sake.

I'm glad you can watch the Takeovers, but for us regular fans, WWE needs to step their DEBUT and BRANDING game up. Most of us don't know who this guys is, or why he's wearing the stupid mouth guard and rolling around, posing like Madonna doing finger dances. It just looks weird and unwarranted if you don't know anything about the guy.

Yada yada... Finn Balor paid off. I'm sure Nakamura is fine. I'll just have to wait until they let him wrestle to see what the hype is all about.

If it ends up being Emily to Emilina type hype, I will be so fucking annoyed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is not aimed at you personally... I understand how NXT works. UH BUT...

Hearing somebody tell me"You should be watching NXT"is kind of like when I don't understand something in a Marvel movie and some Nerd says"Well, did you read the Comic Book??"

No. I don't read comic books. I prefer films. So I expect Filmmakers to do their goddamn job and tell me the whole storyIN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR FILM. I don't expect to have to do homework to understand the backstory of a movie.

Same with Raw or Smackdown. Don't just put Roman Reigns in the ring and TELL people he's the Big Dog. Make him earn that shit. Make people realize it for themselves.

And don't drop Shinsuke Nakamura on a bunch of unsuspecting fans who haven't invested time in NXT (because they don't haver the time to invest) and maybe give us a video bio or something. Or maybe have him win a few matches in grandiose style before you send him out rolling and writhing to some shitty violin music.

We shouldn't have to look up a wrestler on google. They should DEBUT him/her properly so we realize it for ourselves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you. You pretty much summed up my problem.

I have a life. A full time job, friends, a Fianc... Ain't nobody got time for NXT. I'm sure it's the shit. I used to love Minor League Baseball. But I just don't have time. So I kind of wish WWE would do a better job of educating people who only tune in for Raw, Smackdown and some of the PPVs. Even Finn Balorwho I now lovewas a little too flamboyant when he debuted in the big show. I was like... "Jesus, who is this guy?". Nakamura is like that times a hundred. Unless he's the BEST WRESTLER IN HISTORY, I think he should dial it back for fuck sake. He's writhing all over the mat and shit like a freak. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would never recommend committing any crime, of course, but in a fantasy alternate reality...

If you know where he drinks, then in theory, you know where he'll be drunk. Drunk people are vulnerable as fuck. Period.

Gather some of your boys together, wait for him to walk out into the parking lot and have a nice, four on one chat with the man. Once he has been "laid down to sleep", remove his keys, phone and wallet from his pockets. Keep any cash for gas and expenses (duh), then drop his keys, phone and wallet into a fucking sewer.

If this guy really did what you say he did, then fuck him. </TEXT>

When I finished the first season, I was not happy. But then the marvelous second season completely turned things around, and even made me look at S1 differently.

Without over-selling it, this is easily one of my favorite shows of all time, containing some of the most riveting, character based interactions I've ever seen on TV or in Film.

I was was initially very frustrated when the creators said they would never reveal what happened. But once I was sucked into the show, it didn't matter anymore. </TEXT>

LikeEnzo is a pretty shitty wrestler, but I'll listen to him say "Cuppa Haters" all day long because it makes me laugh. Same thing with New Day... As separate parts, they were all very average; but as New Day, they have that 'it' thing that entertains people. The Usos just don't have 'it'. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help Me Get Revenge On An Christian Who Complained to the President Of My Company About My "Red Devil" Google Profile Pic! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-08 22:06:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm employed at a company that woks with Schools around the country. My Google Profile picture is that of a funny Red Devil.

Today I sent an email the Office manager of a notoriously intolerant Christian School... When I say intolerant, I meanthey won't accept openly gay students, etc.

Anyway... She emailed the President of my company (who I happen to share an office with) and asked him to address the matter of my devil picture, saying that it was unprofessional. In other words... I'm a Christian and I'm offended by the image of a Red Devilso you should make him change it.

I wasn't forced... But it was suggested that I change my Google Profile pic. So I did.

Even though I'm not in trouble and everybody in my officeincluding The Presidentgot a good chuckle over it... I can't help but still be annoyed. SO...

Fuck this Christian Bitch! How do I get my revenge?? </TEXT>

But S2 really turned the whole experience around for me, and now I can't wait for S3. I don't give a shit if anything ever gets explained... This is good stuff.

<TEXT> You are 100% correct. I'm not in here trying to spread hate on RR, but the fact is... He's not the best right now. But he IS getting all the best matches, and the fans are calling BS by booing.

Like I said in my original comment... They just need to stop pushing him so hard. Pump the breaks and let him grow an organic fanbase.

And I also agree that he should take time away to reinvent himself. A lot of great wrestlers (including his cousinThe Rock) have gone through a reinvention or two.

In a sick way, it would almost be beneficial if he were to have an an injury, so he would be forced out of action for like 6 months.

Hit the goddamn reset button with this guy already.

<TEXT> I don't hear his cheers getting any louder either on TV or the House Show I attended. So I'm not sure I actually agree with that, as I've heard it with my own ears.

But I do agree that it's a bit reminiscent of politics... Like the way the DNC tried to force Hilary Clinton on America over Bernie Sanders (the real people's choice), and then ended up losing to Trump.

WWE should take a lesson... You can't force your choice on the fans. Ultimately, they pick who they like. And the more you try and force it, the more you risk negative consequences. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This pretty much sums up my point.

I actually don't have a problem with Reigns. I just think it's ridiculous that WWE continues to try and shove him down the throat of the audience rather than let him develop a fan base organically.

The New Day is a good example... Love them or hate them, nobody could have really predicted the niche they filled or how popular they became. It had to grow over time and develop naturally.

It's almost like the powers that be in the WWE are trying to spite the audience by continuing to put Reigns in the spotlight. They don't seem to understand their own fans on this issue. </TEXT>

You're comment Karma is REALLY impressive though. And you're collection of reddit achievement badges is REALLY cool.

<TITLE> Apt Complex trying to bump our rent up by $130/month, but they're advertising our same floor plan/square footage online for $80 cheaper... What should we do? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Fucking Austin... Everything is getting more expensive.

Basically, we've lived here in our current apartment complex for 2 years with the same rent.

We were expecting a bump in our rates this renewal, but $130/month seems like a pretty big bump.

So we went online to compare other complexes in the area and found several advertisements for OUR COMPLEX advertising our exact apartment (same floor plan and square footage) for $80 less that the renewal rate they are offering us.

My thought was just to go into the office, speak with the manager and ask if a mistake was made and then show them the online ads.

Is there a better strategy I should employ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wait wait wait... I was giving a serious answer to the question. Fuck all the whiney little bitch cry-babies who downvoted.

The TL;DR questions was... Why does Cena get more attention from the WWE than Kane? And I stand by my answer.

I personally don't think he's ugly... I fucking love Kane! But he's got that wonky eye and cro-magnun for-brow... He's not traditionally handsome like Cena is. They didn't put him in a mask for nothing, people. Issac Yankem scared people.

You dumb fucking fan boys who think they downplay his charitable efforts because it might be bad for the Kane brand are seriously fucking stupid. Seriously.

TV is a petty place. That's why there aren't very many ugly celebrities.

Cena is TV friendly. Kane isn't. Don't overthink it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, man... Good on you. One of the best things I ever did in my life was leave Orlando, FL and move to Los Angeles. The first year was TOUGH. But I did it. And I was very proud of myself when I was able to stick it out and make it work in a new city.

There was nothing particularly wrong with Central Florida... I actually love Florida and may return one day to retire... But just like you, I wanted a change. So many people tried to talk me out of leaving (even close friends), but I stuck to my guns, and it completely changed my life.

I spent 10 years in LA. To say that it was a transformative decade would be an understatement. I now live in Austin, TX and I couldn't be happier with my current life. In fact, moving to Austin was a much easier prospect because I had already jumped cities once before. Had I not been bold enough to make that move, I may very well be doing exactly what I was doing before I left Central Florida.

Now I'm fearless with regard to relocation. I'm not afraid of moving to another city and starting over again if I need to. Some people have lived in the same place their whole life and are crippled by fear thinking about having to move.

If I can offer you one piece of advice... If you have a job currently, look into transferring with that same company to wherever you want to go. I was fortunate when I was in Florida to have 2 jobs (1 full time 1 part time) and I was actually able to transfer with BOTH jobs to Los Angeles. And these were not glamorous jobs... I was an Assistant Manager at a movie Theater and a part-time Assistant Manager at fucking Blockbuster video. BUT... I arrived in LA with 2 jobs. I never had to worry about money. I never had to eat ketchup packets.

If you don't have a job right now, consider getting a gig in your current city with a large retail chain or restaurant group (or something along those lines)... Not only will you be able to save up a little cash for your move, but you will likely be able to transfer with them. If you have an income... Everything else (shelter, food, etc) is easy to arrange. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I try to give myself 3 big goals every year. Things that are realistic and achievable.

My Goals   Reasons for 2017... 

**Start learning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.** I'm out of shape and I don't enjoy typical exercises, but I am fascinated with Mixed Martial Arts and would like to also like to beef up my self-defense skills. BJJ seems like a good fit.

**Open a Savings Account and make regular monthly deposits.** I subscribe to [/r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/?ref=search_subreddits) and this is one of the number one pieces of advice given. I'd like to have a Rainy Day Fund for emergencies as well as start investing in 2018. My girlfriend and I both make a decent living, and it's about time to start saving some of it for the future.

**Travel to Iceland.** We've been invited to a [gay wedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtgY1q0J_TQ) in Iceland. It will be our first gay wedding and my first big trip abroad. I've traveled extensively in America... It's time to take the show international. The only countries outside of America that I have visited are Mexico and Canada. Everything about Iceland is beautiful and I can't wait to visit, see the sites, and witness my friends get hitched. </TEXT>

I live in Austin. I understand the disappointment, I even understand the anger and rage. I didn't vote for Trump and I'm not happy about him being the President. Buuuuut...

You have absolutely zero effect on anything by blocking traffic in Austin, TX. Seriously. You change nothing. You expose nothing. You aren't drawing attention to anything that can be altered via protest. It's a complete waste of time.

The only thing you're drawing attention to is yourselves.

Trump will take office.

I noticed the new "Service Charge" thing this past week and wondered what was up.

I just called InstaCart. The gentleman I spoke to says that the 'Service Fee' still represents tips for the workers. I was very specific... I made sure he understood that I was asking if their shoppers and drivers still received the service fee and he said yes.

Was this a lie?

My girlfriend hasn't InstaCarted in a few weeks but she's picking up some shifts this week. Her tips are normally great... If they suddenly take a nosedive this weekI'm calling them back and screaming bullshit. </TEXT>

I called Apple Support and got the same explanation that they know about the problem and are working to fix.

This is infuriating. This is a piece of hardware that has stopped working because of a beef on Apple's end. Can you imagine if they released a software update and all of their iPhones just stopped working? Or MacBooks??

A. Explaining the issue.

<TEXT> Yeah... Multi-hyphenate isn't a badge of honor.

The reason people hate on Glover is because he's spread himself too thin. Rather than focus on one skill and being the best in that area, he is trying to "do it all" and turing out mediocre material in all areas.

The bottom line is, unless you've decided to be a super-fan of Glover, most people either don't know him at all or view him in these terms:

He's nowhere near the funniest comedian.

He's nowhere near the best actor.

He's almost completely unknown as a writer/producer (both of which are extremely easy titles to grab when you're an established entity in Hollywood, btw).

And he' not even close to the top 100 when it comes to the best MCs in the hip hop game.

It's just that simple... When people are handed bullshit, they see it as the bullshit it is. It's why J-Lo's career in Film suffered to the point where she barely has any significant film roles in the past decade. It's why Jamie Foxx flat out quit doing stand-up comedy. The typical fans of popular culture aren't interested in an above average guy who can do 5-6 things all right. They want to back a certified mega-star who is the best in his/her field.

Glover ain't it. He has peaked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's kind of a comeback.

Patton throws a lot of shade at other people on Twitter. He's a very very active tweeter. He says a lot of things publicly, and make his living as a celebrity.

So the idea that he was making a public remark and then somebody shut him downalbeit in a completely non sequitur fashion, with a total redirect on topicit could be considered a comeback.

I think we can all agree... It was SAVAGE as fuck.

Now, I'm now defending the guy. He's clearly a dick. That joke would have been cruel at a celebrity roast, let alone unprompted, out of nowhere on Twitter.

<TEXT> Big up vote for articulating something I've been trying to say for a while, but had a hard time forming the words... Bray is great ion the mic, but never goes anywhere. No direction is the perfect way to sum it up.

He's always talking about how the other guy "doesn't understand what they're dealing with", etc. But everybody does seem to understand... He's a dark guy. We all get it. But what next??

The Undertaker (love him or hate him) always built his promos up to his signature "Rest... In... Peace." which the crowd loves. "Follow the Buzzards" just doesn't have the same iconic feel. I mean fuckthe crowd eats it up every time Big Caz spells out S-A-W-F-T... Bray just doesn't have whatever that "it" factor is that takes guys to the next level. </TEXT>

What should WWE do with him?

I don't think his 'character' is currently (or has the potential to be) as iconic as The Undertaker and Kane.

And the writers   bookers seem to be having a hard time giving him a serious, long-term push.

What could WWE do to make this guy bigger than he is right now?

<TEXT> Holy shit, that's an awesome question.

I've lived all over... Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Florida, Connecticut, Arizona, California and Texas... So I've seen a little variety.

If rent/ownership was exactly the same everywhere in the USA, I might actually move to Key West, FL and stay there until I die of old age or get blown out to sea by a Hurricane.

I have no idea what the crime/homeless/traffic stats are for Key West, but it's South Florida, so I'm sure there are drugs-a-plenty. I lived in Miami for a year and there was a lot lot lot of crime and drugs and traffic (the 95 South between Fort Lauderdale and North Miami is horrendous).

All I really know is that I've visited there many times and it feels like Key West is a small paradise at the dick end of America.

I might also say something like Hawaii. But I would specifically want to live in the movie/tv show Hawaii... You know, the one that looks like the Garden of Eden in the Pacific. But I've also seen a lot of Dog the Bounty Hunter, and I don't want to live in that Hawaii. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Austin is actually 11th. ( -- don't you hate it when people on reddit nit-pick the details)

For serious though... Yes, I know. I mean, I didn't think I was coming to a crime free utopia, but comparatively speaking... Austin is safer on paper.

And now the big reveal (that nobody is actually waiting for)... I moved from #2. That's righthate me even more, I came from Los Angeles to Austin. I'm a walking clich.

I am not from LA. I grew up in Florida (again, please don't judge me too harshly), but I lived in LA for a decade. Here are some fun facts...

LA is even closer to Mexico/the Cartels/drugs, has the 2nd highest concentration of homeless per capita (after New York) and has literally the worst traffic in America... The traffic is so bad that LA is the only American city to make the global top 10 of the Most Traffic-Congested Cities. Not even New York made the World list.

None of this is bragging rights. I lived in LA for 10 years and steadily grew to hate it. Moving to Austin felt like a dream come true. And now, it seems, that me and all my fellow relocaters are bringing that dream to an end.

So even though Austin may have always seemed like a crime-ridden party-town to you guys... It looked very appealing to me when I came here 4 years ago. </TEXT>

I moved here from a much bigger city with a much larger homeless population where crimes like drug-related theft are so common that they're normal.

Statistically, Austin is a safer place. Which is one of the reasons I moved here.

We don't care about chairs and walking. And we typically don't care about anything that happens and stops... It's just sustained noise over a long period of time that starts to wear me down. And of course, if it's a weeknight, it seems more annoying.

Technically... Quiet hours at our complex are 10PM to 10AM.

A little background; we live just outside of the UT Austin campus. We know that a lot of the tenants in our complex are college kids, and this includes our upstairs neighbor, who is a French girl of college age. My girlfriend and I are adults with adult jobs.

I don't want to have tension with a neighbor... I'm a hot head and I've yelled at neighbors in the past. It just makes things worse. I want to solve this peacefully... But my own temper worries me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have to agree with this.

I am not a hardcore fan by any stretch... But I would typically pay for 2 PPVs a year at $60 each.

Now, for $9.99/month (which is only $120 a year) I get all the PPVs plus a bunch of other stuff.

Great deal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those still in doubt, it was obviously a work. WWE wants very badly for everybody to start tuning into Talking Smack and this was a great way to generate interest.

I just wasn't buying it.

I mostly like The Miz, but the moment he tried to amp up the heat and start shouting "for real", all I could do was laugh.

How could anybody take him seriously?

<TEXT> Agree with both of you, Basketsky and _Cotton_Teeth.

I guess that's where I ultimately land when I put any thought to it. I love so many of the movies/scenes listed in this thread, but none of them strike me as particularly "iconic".

When I think of iconic scenes, I think of things that not only broke the moldbut that also stood the test of time.

Maybe it's just a question of waiting... What scene mentioned here will really be remembered 20-50 years from now?

I mean... The Wizard of Oz has been very resilient. The Ben Hur with Charlton Heston. Kubrick films... But the scenes don't have to come from old movies necessarily. Even the Hoth/Walker sequence from Empire Strikes back, or the roof-top jump from Die Hard... These scenes were unbelievably fresh when they were first released, and then they remained at the top of the list. Fight Club and The Matrix (love them or hate them) were some of the last films that had anything really 'iconic' in them.

SIDE NOTE: Some might mention Avatar because of the revolutionary 3D. But I would say that Avatar has not stood the test of time very well, and will only be seen as iconic in the context of 3D films.

All of the scenes mentioned here are memorable and entertaining. But iconic status is top level shit.

I just think we're in a 10-20 year lull at the moment. Too many sequels and reboots and half-assed franchises. With so many rehashes, it's hard to do something that changes the game and stays relevant 40-50 years after it was made. </TEXT>

I'm not kidding.

I don't think any scene from any movie in the past 10 years will be remembered as iconic.

Hollywood hasn't produced anything groundbreaking and/or worthy of the history books since the late 90's.

And before everybody jumps on me... I like a lot of films from the past 10 years, I just don't think they hit the mark of "iconic". That's a pretty heavy word. </TEXT>

I've done both... Quality of life is hard to put a price tag on, but if you enjoy showing up to work every day and as long as you're making enough money to cover your bills and have some fun... It's not broken. Don't fix it. </TEXT>

He's definitely an interesting and controversial figure. I wonder if anybody outside of WWE will ever make a comprehensive documentary about him. I know a couple of semi-well-reviewed books have been written.

I'd like to see an outside organization or production company tackle a no-holds-barred (pun completely fucking intended) documentary on old Vince. ESPN has been doing a pretty sweet job with their 30 for 30 docs and OJ: Made in America. I think if they did a VKM Biography it would turn out well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 100% agree. Vince continued to expand on his Father's work and changed professional wrestling into the extravaganza we all know and love today. It would be nice to see him honored.

Having said that... Once they're done honoring him, I would be perfectly happy to never see his creepy, old steroid enhanced ass on television ever again.

As an in-show character/personality, he has ceased to become entertaining for me. Whenever I see him (or HHH for that matter) getting physical and throwing themselves into the "action", I almost always fast forward.

It's kind of like when Puff Daddy used to constantly say shit in the background go any Notorious B.I.G. songI'd literally scream at my stereo"GET OFF THE TRACK, PUFFY!"

Stay off the shows, Vince.

But seriously... Off the air the guy is a stallion. The steroid bod creeps me out, but fuck it. Old people can do what they want. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The 10 Worst and The 10 Best Things About The WWE Right Now - Summer 2016 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-09 22:39:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *WWE stands for World Wrestling Entertainment.*

*The definition of Entertainment is  an event, performance, or activity designed to provide amusement of enjoyment.*

*The opposite of Entertainment is Disappointment and Boredom.*

# SUMMER 2016

## The 10 Worst

**1. Make Darren Young Great Again**  What. The. Fuck? No, but seriously What the fuck? This is not funny. Its awkward like British Sitcoms. Old Bob Backlund is more painful to watch than Old Ric Flair. Darren Young is a stiff. And theyre clearly not recording at the same timebut trying very hard to act like they are. This blatant programming filler needs to be 86d.

**2. Byron Saxton**  I dont care about his history. I dont care how he got the job. He sucks. He contributes absolutely nothing to any given broadcast. When will the WWE fire this boring, goofy-grinning motherfucker?

**3. Baron Corbin**  Literally the least interesting wrestler to receive a push in the past 20 years. Dumb character, dumb outfit, dumb promos, and seriously uninspired wrestling. Besides We already have a non-specific dark guy in Bray Wyatt. Speaking of which

**4. Bray Wyatt**  The One Promo For Life era is over. Or at least it should be YESicons like Hulk Hogan and The Undertaker made decades-long careers by cutting the exact same promo every single fucking week But that was then and this is now. Brays mysterious, one-promo, Cult Leaderwho never gets too specific about his darknesshas just become stale.

**5. The Wyatt Familys Feud with The New Day**  I understand that many wrestling fans prefer the serious melodrama to the goofy antics of The New Daybut this shit is just stupid and lame. Seriouslywhat is the actual threat that the Wyatts represent to the New Day? Why wouldnt The New Day survive a confrontation with The Wyatts? Dumb ddumb dumb.

**6. 75% of the Wrestlers Theme songs sounding similar**  Whos coming out? Is that Sami Zayn or fucking Becky Lynch?? Thanks, CFO$. WWE, heres an idea Take a note from your old playbook and team up with some popular artists and get some better fucking music. Yes it might cost more, but it would be worth it.

**7. The Usos calling everybody Oos**   First of allthe Usos are one-dimensional and fairly boring to begin with But seriously, WWEstop trying to make Oos happen. Its not gonna happen.

**8. The Social Outcasts**  An obvious, yet feeble attempt to duplicate the group-dynamic/success of The New Daywhich is not working. Mostly because Heath Slater is a fucking twat and the three Outcasts just dont have that New Day chemistry.

**9. Splitting RAW and Smackdown (again) as a Brand Extension**  Just Fuck off, WWE.

**10. WWE Doesnt seem to give a shit about the Fans**  I think the recent push of Roman Reigns where they had to resort to actually muting the negative crowd responses is a great example. Keep kicking us and we will not be your Marks forever. So again Just fuck off, WWE.


## The 10 Best

**1. Ambrose is the Champ**  Well done for a change, WWE. Ambrose sure is fun. Like that time he and Chris Jericho faced each other in

**2. The Asylum Match at Extreme Rules**  Holy shit. I wasnt expecting all that. Just when I thought I would see some pussified, half-measure WWE showed they still have some balls.

**3. The Complete absence of HHH and Vince McMahon**  Fuckin douchebags. Keep them away.

**4. Sasha Banks and Paige**  The Female Division is a weird place right now. The stories are weak and the matches are kind of lame, but Regardless of how we all feel about the athleticism and talent amongst the females, can we all just agreethese two are hot.

**5. AJ Styles Heal Turn**  The man was juuuuust not cutting it as a Face. But the minute he started talking shit and beating up John Cena with The Clubwow He really bloomed.

**6. Enzo   Cass**  Two words Refreshing. Entertaining. 

**7. Canadians**  Jericho, Owens, Zayn, etc Theyre all great.

**8. ThRollins**  In an era of saggy promos and weak microphone skills, there are only a handful of Heals in the WWE still doing it right. And Seth Rollins is at the top of his heal game right now. Despite being side-lined by a serious injury, he made a great come-back, and hes as spoiled and rotton as ever.

**9. The Golden Truth**  I might be the only person who really thinks this shit is hilariousbut Im right. This shit is hilarious. Again I understand that many WWE fans prefer Soap Opera to Comedybut not me. The funnier the better And these two really make me laugh.

**10. Anytime Kevin Owens is a Guest Commentator at the Announcers Table**  Good lord is KO amusing. I already loved him for his Molson gut and chubby Poutine-derived cheeks, but the shit that comes out of his mouth on commentaryespecially when he disses Byron Fuck-Face Saxonis absolutely precious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sometimes forget that I'm a crotchety, old man, and that the bulk of the core audience are young people and families.

Still... All of the best "kids" entertainment keeps the writing solid and doesn't tend to dumb it down (think Harry Potter).

I think the WWE would benefit from some better goddamn stories! It's like when they kept trying to force Roman Reigns down everybody's throat when it was clear he just wasn't the fan favorite... There was a million different ways they could've pushed him other than how they did that would have sat better with the fans.

I don't know... Maybe I'm the only one who wasn't sick of New Day yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LookI think the feud is awesome. And I agree that The Wyatt Family is the perfect foil for New Day's positivity... It's the specific way they're executing the story I think sucks:

* The complete lack of motivation for Xavier to stray from his squad and the fact that this is suddenly coming out of nowhere.

* Xavier's terrible attempt at *subtle* acting. Jesus Christ... He is the perfect heel and he is laugh-out-loud funnybut his range is LIMITED.

* Kofi and Big E acting as goofy as alwaysseemingly oblivious to Xavier's misgivings.

* Bray Wyatt*who I love in the ring*still being Bray Wyatt.


You talk about needing to transcend... This guys hasn't changed his schtick at all. And it's really getting stale.


What exactly is Bray Wyatt's message? He never get's too specific about it.


Anyway... I love the idea of WWE's darkest feeding with WWE's Lightest. I just think the angle they are taking is so fucking weak.


They could have done much better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The New Day is one of the most popular acts in the WWE right now. They're hilarious. And t's obvious that WWE is aware, because they're trying to clone the success of The New Day with otherless talentedcliques like The Social Outcasts.

But now... Out of nowhere... The idea that Xavier Woods is suddenly not participating in the New Day antics because he's somehow being manipulated (or scared?) by Bray Wyatt is absolutely stupid.

Seriouslywho's coming up with this shit? What is the end game of this horrible storyline?

Is Xavier going to break up the New Day?

So dumb. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Dad's dead body.

I was 18 and was pressured by my Grandma to accompany my Mom inside the funeral parlor. I stood as far away as possible and just watched while my Mom did her thing. As far as I was concerned, it was no longer my Dad.

A few years earlier she also made me stand next to and touch my Grandpa's dead body. I'd take that one back also actually.

She's not weird or anything, she's a great Grandma... But I wish I had refused her on those two occasions.

Funny but still Serious Edit:
A couple years after my Dad died my Mom said she found a VHS tape of my 7th Grade Birthday Party. When she popped it in the VCR it turned out to be an old sex tape of her and my Dad. I would also 100% surgically excise that memory from my brain as well. </TEXT>

SIR MIX-A-LOT - SWASS

It may not be in the same league as the others mentioned here... But it was a 'masterpiece' in my eyes for several reasons...

- It didn't fit conveniently into any rap sub-genre of the time.
- It was very funny.
- Almost every track is good.
- The production was different than other artists of the era.
- Sir Mix's lyrics are good!
- Buttermilk Biscuits

Mix-A-Lot is remembered mostly for the song Baby Got Back off of his third album Mack Daddy, but his first two albums (Swass and Seminar) are solid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Noooo, nononono. You're welcome to your own opinion, obviously, but I ALSO have to interject... 

Watchmen is NOT A NOVEL. Watchmen is a Comic Book.

The term Graphic Novel was invented (I think way back back in the 60's) specifically to market comic books as a more legitimate form of storytelling. Surprise! This was immediately (and fucking forever) embraced by the comic industry, and also by comic readers... Because they both so desperately wanted their medium legitimized.

So if we're taking our cues from marketing people, I guess "Corinthian Leather" is better than normal leather... And I suppose name brand pharmaceuticals are WAY better than generic.

The bottom line is--if it has pictures--it isn't a novel. Novel writer's use nothing but their words to paint the picture of their story. This is NOT TRUE of Comic Book writers. A comic script is much closer to a screenplay, in that is is ultimately a blueprint for a TEAM OF ARTISTS to completely realize.

TL;DR - Comic Book fans need to quit trying to make comic books into something more than they are.

EDIT: Downvote me all you want, bitches. I keep it real. Check my comment and post history and you'll see how few fucks I give. Glad I was able to hit a nerve. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not very fast, so it would be perfect for slow tracking.

I tried it over a 20 foot distance last night and it worked well. I'm thinking there will be a dip the longer the distance gets... But the nice thing about this rig, is that you can go low to high or vice versa... And it will "climb" a pretty steep angle.

NOTE: There is a rotating spindle that you wrap the string around which provides the forward movement... If you DON'T wrap the string around it, the unit will slide down a properly angled line at faster speeds.

NOTE 2: The engine connects to a couple of large wheels which transfer power to the spindle with the string wrapped around it... A smarter, craftier person could probably figure out a way to cut out one or both of the wheels out and transfer more power directly to the spindle to make the drive faster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mostly novelty... I typically use the GoPro for typical GoPro things. But I also make music videos and experimental film stuff, and I love how lightweight and tiny it is, so I have fun playing with mounting ideas to capture unique footage.

As for this rig... You are really only limited by 2 things:

A. The length of the string.

B. Wind conditions if recording outdoors.

And the shooting is smooth. In the absence of a Drone-Mount, or a "Steady-Cam" type rig, this gives a nice, straight line. I am thinking about using it for overhead shots with the cam pointed straight down. Like me lying on my bed or something. But I also had an idea to run a line through the open driver and passenger windows of like 8 cars parked next to each other and letting the camera track through the cars while the various people inside doing funny things on their lunch break.

I also manage an office and want to put together a virtual tour video... I have thought of a few shots where I can run the GoPro through our Ikea Cubicles or overhead looking down on our work-stations. Fun stuff.

And the set up time is actually pretty quick. If I had clamps or something on the ends of the strings, the whole thing can go up in less than 2 minutes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I purchased a Tin Can Cable Car toy from Terra Toys in Austin for $17.

I purchased the Hot Wheels "Gravity" Builders Set for $9.99 at Target.

Using the Red Clamp from the Hotwheels set, I drilled a hole big enough for the pin that holds the can in place from the Cable Car Toy. I was able to easily secure the Red Clamp, which will hold the GoPro in a variety of positions.

This is perfect for Side to Side tracking shots... But there is a shit-ton of possibilities.

<TEXT> Easy... I'd create and produce a Traveling Reality TV Road Show where I just walk Shia LaBeouf to different states/cities, set up a booth, and then charge people money to punch him in the face.

A one-punch KO wins the big prize--but since he's now indestructibeuof he'll never get hurt or die--Shia LeBOOM goes the dynamite!

Career Track, bitches!

Now obviously, a show as original and inspiring as THE SHIA LABEOUF TRY YOUR LUCK BOOTH will become a virally trending ratings bonanza. So in between the production cycles, when I get tired of literally pissing on poor people, and I've grown bored with the Shi-Life... I'll have my GoogleBot Driver fly me and my G6 to different damn Continent, and leave the idiot Production Staff to wrangle ShiBeouf while I'm away.

Sure, the story could end right there... But the realist in me suspects that after two decades of exploiting a helplessly compulsive immortal, I'll probably grow tired of Champagne and Caviar and rubbing my penis on jewels and yachts, and the popularity of the "Punch LaBeouf" gimmick will likely fade, taking with it all of that easy cash.

BUT--and let's be honest here... With my level of raw charisma, when it's finally time to give him the Shia LeBoot, I'll be a legitimately celebrated household name, not to mention--a popular installation on global television.

At that stage in the game my income won't be exclusively tied to Beouf. So when I finally close the book on that lucrative chapter, I'll just pay NASA (or Richard Branson's frozen, disembodied head) to strap Shia onto a LeBooster Rocket and blast him into deep space.

At the minimum I will buy myself and this entire sector of the Galaxy, a sizable chunk of Shia Free Time to reflect and meditate on how he touched our lives.

But the truth is--even if he ultimately somehow survived, and if he was somehow able navigate home--my time here will have long ended, so... Whoever/whatever is ruling the Earth then will also inherit the task of welcoming back ShLeBo.

Here's to the future! </TEXT>

Yes--2001 is a circle jerk topic on Reddit and amongst film critiques... But without specifying details, you can take my word as an Internet stranger you know fuck-all about... it actually deserves its reputation and more. Most people have a hard time finding their own interpretation and just lump themselves in with the majority.

<TEXT> "Party Tricks" may not be the most accurate description, but I always have my battle-proven STANDARD PARTY TRIFECTA at the ready:

1. Standout Character

2. Supreme Confidence

3. Spontaneous Comedy

Nine times out of Ten, I roll into a party fashionably late--automatically separating myself from the heard and adding a typically more noticeable entrance to my party profile.

Within 5-15 minutes of arriving--everybody who I want to meet will know who I am (or will want to meet me).

This draws others toward MY location--which quickly facilitates me powering forward with my humor and easing myself into the #1 'Funniest Guy at the Party' spot with pretty minimal effort.

PRO-TIP: If you're running low on Confidence, Character or Comedy--you can effectively employ the "FAKE IT TIL YOU MAKE IT STRATEGY" for all three items!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> THANK CHRIST I didn't have to post 2001. Thank you, footshotxlegacy. When I saw that INTERSTELLAR was the #1 comment, I actually pulled out my hanky and wept for the future.

Fair Warning to anybody claiming Interstellar as their #1 pick:

Outside of Reddit, be careful about naming Interstellar as your #1 pick in front of others... There is a correct answer--and that answer is universally and unquestionably 2001: a space odyssey.

People may start talking to you slowly and treating you like a retarded child. This is normal. Try not to take it too personally. Understand that--based on your selection--it's acceptable to assume that it's possible you may be an imbecile.

The good news is, it's a quick fix. Just reevaluate you absurd opinions and correct them, and all will be well again after the standard 10-25 years it takes to forget such an obvious oversight.

**EDIT: Downvote me all you want, bitches. Check my link/comment history and you'll see all of the fucks I don't give. FUTURE FACT: In 10 years, Interstellar will be mostly forgotten. BUT 2001 ON THE OTHER HAND... Me and my elitist coalition of Film Snob hipsters (I'd mention the group's name--but you're not cool enough to have heard of it)... We'll all still be watching further-enhanced release versions of Kubrick's immortal classic 2001 exhibited in theaters on big screens, and we will all wear replica vintage clothing which has been ironically pre-distressed, and spit hot, locally, craft-roasted coffee onto nearby homeless derelicts.

Eat that bowl of Wheaties, Champs!

EDIT 2: I'm sticking to my guns because Reddit doesn't actually respect anything else. Let's revisit Interstellar in 2 weeks after some time to reflect.

I know we have to come together on something...

What about Boobs? Boobs are great, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> No real epiphany. I never really bought into it.

I was raised Christian and indoctrinated into the [Seventh Day Baptist](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Day_Baptists) denomination. NOT to be confused with [Adventists](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church)!

They are a fairly typical Christian faith, comparable to Methodists and Presbyterians--the only difference being that the are Sabbath Keepers and worship at church on Saturday--the Seventh Day.

My Mother and her family (mother, grandparents, aunts/uncles, cousins, etc) were/are all well known and active in the denomination. So attending Church and going to Sabbath School all seemed very normal and even fun when I was a young kid--but truth be told, I was an attention whore who loved being around other kids, and a lot of what I loved about going to service was social.

My Dad was born and raised in Salt Lake City, and his working class parents preferred hard drinking and chain smoking to Mormonism. So I always observed 2 role models growing up, my Mom who went to Church, and my Dad who stayed home.

I was a smart kid. And I was born with a flawless lie detector... I always know when I'm being lied to. When you're a kid, grown ups often try to lie to you as a shortcut or path of low effort... But I could always tell. I figured out that Santa Claus was made up at 4, and by 6 (as I learned about things like Dinosaurs, Outer Space) I lost interest in the clearly mythical/metaphorical stories from the Bible and became fascinated with other things, like History and Science Fiction.

I began asking lots of hard to answer questions about the Bible, God, Heaven and Christianity... And I rarely found the answers I was looking for. Pastors, Priests, Rabbis, Youth Bible Camp Counselors; I asked a lot of damn adults a lot of damn questions. I was trying to reconcile what I believed was the real truth in my 'heart' with the stories and teachings of Christianity. And they didn't jive. Too many important things didn't make sense to me.

By the time I was graduating High School, I was an open Atheist.

I'm in my late 30's now and nothing has changed.

TL;DR... I'm not religious because my heart tells me not to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   Different people create different links between the various elements comprising their lives.

And most of us develop a different way to make these connections.

As we age, and as the total amount of data stored in our minds increases, the number of associative strands linking these component elements together ALSO increase, eventually weaving together and forming the fabric of our minds.

In your particular case, what is most likely happening is simply a consequence of how you individually perceive   process the external data you ingest each day.

Our brains never really stop working... When we're awake during the day we take in new data, then at night while we sleep we subconsciously process all of it.

This cycle of ingesting and processing information essentially becomes an iterative system by which we practice and refine our unique methods of perception.

The more that we streamline our individual techniques, the more adept our minds become at filtering and picking out certain details that other people may subconsciously "blur out" (or completely ignore) in favor of their own preferences.

It's essentially the same difference in general perception that causes some people to view a water glass as being half full while others can see the same exact same glass as being half empty.

Your mind is already open to the idea of coincidence in your life. And as you innately gravitated toward that particular perceptual rubric, you have also slowly conditioned yourself to identify instances of happenstance and/or serendipity.

So it sounds like you're genetically predisposed and wired neurologically to draw near-automatic associations between similar situations/people/places (which is not at all unusual)--hence your resulting over-perception of what you have ultimately labeled as 'Coincidences' in your life.

Or something like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd have to kind of agree with some others in here... Unless you're holding out for a personal/religious reason, there is no reason to wait. Don't be afraid... Awkward first sex is a basic part of the typical human experience. Don't make a mountain out of a mole hill. But stop the insanity and quit putting it off. Go out tonight... Get drunk, hire a hooker, politely ask a female friend--whatever--just do something. Get it over with. Now. Power through Round 1 so you aren't hung up on the "virginity" thing.

Your first time will not roll out perfectly no matter how you approach it, so throw caution to the wind and just DO THE DAMN THING. Once you flip the script, Round 2, and Round 3 will be much easier. And eventually you build up enough momentum (read--experience) and then--BAM! You wake up one day and realize you have a sex life.

But you have to win a few skirmishes and battles before you can fight the war.

Sex is awesome. It's really awesome. But the longer you wait and wonder, the more mythic the event becomes... And it's just not worth waiting arbitrarily. It's just sex. Once you pull the trigger--you'll understand. It's a much bigger preoccupation when you think you might be missing out on something great. And it will continue to grow in importance until you give up completely or drop the hammer.

Just remember... Think of Sex as a lifelong, iterative process. And give yourself permission to fuck up and have fun with it. After all--it's SEX! Just don't be disappointed if losing your virginity doesn't end up feeling like the Quckening in Highlander.

Popping your cherry won't Shatter the Earth or turn you into a instant god-stallion. You won't be fundamentally changed afterwards--you'll be the same person--just a little less sexually curious/frustrated.

So try to relax and really enjoy yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> PART 3 - The Erosion of the Middle Class (of films).

All right; the movies themselves have shifted to a small-risk/big-gain system of generating revenue. And now the movie theater chains exhibiting these weak pictures have also themselves fully transformed into soulless, corporate mega-plexes--bent on getting our precious cash.

At this point, the strategy (if there was such a thing) shifted away from making excellent films that 'play all summer' in favor of shitting out these now-familler, cookie-cut, unimportant, insubstantial, piles of crappy eye candy... TRICKS not Treats, that have been specifically designed to swiftly recoup budget and ad revenue monies by using slick, spoiler-packed (and usually misleading) trailers to seduce starved Movie Geeks into shitty films. Like a Mad Men marketing schemee.

Timing always plays a factor... And knowing that all the poor saps will end up feeling ripped off when they realize just how fucking awful the movie was. So the new Prime Directive became simple... Shock   Awe. Get as many people to pay for the latest Sci-Fi fuck up, or Comic Book shit stain--then stock-pile as much goddamn money as possible before the negative reviews circulate, or bad word of mouth kills the momentum completely. It's like a scam we keep volunteering to fall for.

It's not that we're stupid. We're not gulible or gluttons for punishment. I swear to Black Baby Jesus I was utterly convinced that JOHN CARTER OF MARS was gonna rock ass. We don't have to do a deep dive on how astoundingly far from the mark I fell short on that score. Let's just say it--the movie fucking sucked. But the Trailer was ridiculous! It made me get excited about the movie! That's the scam. But it's not our fault because... 

THE FACT IS, we still hold onto our optimistic excitement because some of these bloated spectacles ulitimatly defy our lowered expectations and deliver something a bit more substative--like CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER.

To me though, one of the worst side effects resulting from all of these elements combining: the near extinction of the Moderately Budgeted Studio Feature. Were they animals, they would be listed as Endangered Species.

Just like disappearing economic middle class in America, contemporary Hollywood films are more often falling into one of two extremes:

Low Budget Art-House Films

OR

Mega-Budget Blockbusters

There was a fabled time that movies from smaller studios and with moderate production budgets--not too high or low but, just right--were a cinema mainstay. Movies like FIRST BLOOD or ALIENS were not filmed on high budgets. But NO MORE. Nowadays, films from the "low" end of the spectrum are typically marketed and sold as theoretically being of a higher quality--but I have to call Bullshit.  In my opinion, the collective difference in distinction is often marginal and typically superficial.

The sad news is: really outstanding films are simply fewer and farther between these days. OF COURSE--excellent films are still made and released every year, but the absurd majority of these so-called Art-House or Indy films (good or bullshit) end up being exploited as Award Season 'calling cards and used to garner artistic street credibility in the industry.

On the complete opposite side of that Teeter Totter,; rom the Studio POV, he Opening Weekend Gross is now the pinnacle concern, and Total Profit is God. What a weird place to live. It's backwards place where talentless, unfuckable Spreadsheet Nerds use sophisticated algorithms to remove  the guess work and catastrophic risk out of movie making by intentionally being bland to appeal to the buffet-food-eating masses, and ensure they make money--regardless of how many people they disappoint.

PART 4 - The Sliding Scale and The Shortened Window

The final piece of the puzzle. It's not a big secret but it's not widely publicized outside the industry... A major innovation that became very popular was the Sliding Scale Exhibition Contract.

Basically, Studios make the majority of the Box Office ticket sales Opening Weekend. Conversely, the Theater Chains keep a higher % of the ticket sales for every week the film stays playing. This is why Theaters sell 11 cents of Popcorn for $6 to make profit. But it also means that the movie Producers typically have no financial incentive to shoot a film with "legs"--that stays popular (maybe even builds momentum) and remains in theaters for a longer time.

So... The SHOCKING secret has been uncovered: The Studios AND Exhibitors both openly prioritize cash over quality. I know... It's astounding.

But most people never connect the dots and see the big picture...

A system designed to manipulate you into buying a ticket on the 1st weekend so the Studios and Financiers can bank vault your dollars before you realize you were scammed.

The bottom line, the final answer is... Movie Lovers are predictable. Until some Boston-Tea-Party-esque event inspires us to revolt, will continue to risk routine disappointment for the chance at catching that rare diamond in the rough.

Despite these facts, people keep going to the movies and spending money.

And that's why bad movies keep getting made. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, lifelong movie geek and former Manager of several large, multi-screen Movie Theaters in Central FL and Los Angeles.

The obvious TL;DR is easy... Major Money. But...

A lot of people might not know how we got to this place. It slaps logic in the face, but it's an observable truism... Year after year since around the turn of the century, Hollywood studios have shamelessly taken turns shitting out astonishingly awful, high-budget "popcorn" films--the majority of which turn big profits..

It's not a conspiracy. It's a business.

The Motion Picture Industry is, was, and always has been about turning a profit.

But the shift to flash over substance was actually a natural progression.

And it can be split into 4 PARTS:


PART 1 - The Rise of the Summer Blockbuster.

In the late 70's, unprecedented, box office smashes like JAWS and STAR WARS redefined many of the ways Hollywood Studios budgeted, produced and marketed films.

Throughout the 40's, 50's and 60's, the motion picture had come to dominate pop culture entertainment. It was a time when a diverse group of filmmakers and studios were producing a great number of films annually, in many different styles and sub-genres.

This was a time where interesting characters, complex stories and quality production were not just ends to a means--but rather essential elements in any major Studio release. Low budget films of that era had such a radically different production aesthetic, they were almost always graphic (for the time) Horror movies or Counter Culture pictures.

The 70's were an innovative, experimental, and almost mythical era in Cinema. The Directors and Writers who rose to prominence in that decade are still some of the biggest names in film history. Before the emergence of the 80's greed culture with its obligatory, laser focus on maximizing profit by all means necessary. The guys with the ticker tape adding machines were utility workers, while ballsy studio executives took exciting risks... A time where a major motion picture could be green-lit and financed based solely off of the artistic merit and well-earned reputations of the writers and directors involved.

But then JAWS/WARS re-wrote the rule book. The Summer Blockbuster existed and a huge, money-making opening weekend was now a proven concept. Success breeds imitators and by the Summer after STAR WARS, every Studio on the damn planet shifted their focus to producing more Blockbusters.

This major philosophical  change became a motivating factor in another paradigm shift within the industry; the final collapse of Old Hollywood. As budgets swelled and profit margins grew wider, competition amongst the major players saw the last vestiges of Hollywood's Golden Era sold, bought, traded, aquired or hostiley taken over by a host of different corporate interests and multi-national conglomerates.

The white-hot injection of 80's corporate greed into the heart of New Hollywood helped to stimulated the establishment of new, standardized, and more-bankable methods of producing films. And once these cost-effective innovations proved successful, traditional Hollywood practices were abandoned almost overnight, and supplanted by the slick, new Profit-focussed standards. 

As a consequence of the corporate takeover in LA, there where fewer Artists and more Middle Managers calling the shots on productions. And these business-minded Desk Jockeys very much coveted The Almighty Dollar more than almost anything. The general quality of films dropped sharply, and stylization was bumped to a lower priority.

The entire industry changed almost overnight to adapt to the new standards.

At the same time, the United States of America saw their previously high-quality manufacturing standards begin to deteriorate in the face of competition from China and Europe.

The Number Crunchers seeking corporate-style success in Hollywood hedged their bets and got very comfortable with the idea of selling an inferior product to quickly recoup losses. And just like bland Buffet Food, the movie going public seemed to forget about flavor and get familiar with flashy mediocrity.

AND just like the greedy cocksuckers they are, the Studios decided to start charging the Exhibitors more money to rent their bullshit film prints.


PART 2 - Dawn of the Mega-Plex.

As the standard practices of traditional Film Exhibition evolved and became corporatized, the actual business of operating a movie theater was now a potentially less lucrative venture. Many owners closed down their theaters and numerous theater chains were bankrupted or went out of business . The gaps in exhibition created opportunities for expansion that lead to yet another significant shift in the industry.

Around the mid 80's/early 90's, several companies and investment groups started snatching-up and acquiring the movie theater chains who were in financial trouble, and the timing proved to be perfect. By the end of the 90's, a handful of corporations (including Knoxville's Regal Entertainment Group) now controlled the entire Exhibition Industry.

By this time, the young Studio Accountants helping to steer the New Hollywood Movie Machine were now absolutely COUNTING on big opening weekends to jump start their profit-earning. Whereas in the past, if a film demonstrated verifiable Longevity (how long the movie plays in theaters before being pulled), it was recognized within the industry as a clear indication of quality filmmaking and popularity.

But because Exhibitors--and more specifically the National Association of Theater Owners--held so much leverage, they were able to capitalize on the situation and began structuring Exhibitions that utilized a "Sliding Scale" which adjusts the % of the Box Office Ticket revenue progressively more in favor of the theater based on how long the movie continued to play. I other words... The longer a movie stayed in theaters, the less money was collected by the Studio. When GLADIATOR became a hit, it stayed playing in first run theaters for nearly 2 months, reducing the Studio's share of ticket sales to virtually nothing.

It soon became even more apparent to the Production Companies that there was really no great financial incentive or fiscal advantage to keeping any film on screens for longer than 3-4 weeks. Regarding quality, giving up on longevity was the final nail in the coffin. Motion pictures of a dramatic or artistic significance were now the exception to Blockbuster Hit rule. As a result of the flip, any film that didn't scream "hit money maker" stood a good chance of being relegated to the Minor Leagues of alternative financing and independent production.

So just a brief recap:

A. Hollywood Studios go Big Corporate.

B. Movie Quality suffers.

C. The Film Exhibition Industry goes Mega-Corporate.

D. Movie quality plummets.

Sigh. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once upon a time in 1994...

From what I remember--it was a pretty fun year. I was 18, freshly graduated from High School, and living the dream in Miami, Florida. 

During this period I divided my free hours into a variety of fun activities involving a wide variety of wacky people... Some of them were scum bags, most of us were cool, but ALL IF US PARTIED.

Among the peripheral, edge associates of my core circle was a quiet guy named Kevin. Kevin was somewhat of a mystery to everybody. He was literally the guy who nobody could remember who's friend he was or how he knew us. No one ever invited him out or told him about parties--but he was always hanging around.

Out of 20 people there were 3 of us who owned cars--and I was one of them. With math like that, giving rides to my friends was pretty standard. So when a nervous looking Kevin magically appeared at my door one Friday night--I knew what he was after...

He needed a ride and he asked me if I would take him to his Uncle's house.

My obligatory, knee-jerk first response--was to blurt out--"SIGH--I'm not sure I can, Kevin" which was immediately met with a happy "I have gas money"--and I knew he did--because one of the only things we knew about Kev was that his Granny got him a Gas Card and paid the bill. CH-CHING!

First stop Gas Station! Next stop--INFINITY!!

As we leave Gas Station I see my gas needle spike and ask--"How much did you put in?"

"$20" he replied.

SCORE!!! So far--So fucking awesome. 18 year old me was pretty stoked. Because $20 bought a lot of damn gas in back in '94, and my tank was officially full.

So Kevin navigates and I continue driving to his Uncle's place. The temp-glow of my full tank euphoria fades, and as I glance around, I realize that I haven't really been paying attention, and don't exactly know where I am--I just know...

I don't belong here.

But--WHY? You ask...

BIG REVEAL: I'm Irish.

And I mean light Irish. Irishy Irish. Indoors in the dark avoiding sunlight Irish. Like a pale with pink blotches bordering on albino kind of Irish. With that undead, kinda semi-translucent skin which can only result from inbred genetics inherited from my Celtic ancestors, who spent 24 hours a day fleeing in terror from the Sun, and hiding in a Bog somewhere in Northern Ireland.

So... I'm white.

That fact in and of itself isn't all that noteworthy, but I knew a lot about being white. I was pretty much an expert of being a white guy. Shoot--I'd even grew up in a mostly white neighborhood. But as I looked around, I couldn't help but notice that a significant number of people were just "hanging out" and loitering in the streets.

Kevin pointed to his Uncle's house. I pulled over and parked in front of the driveway. "K--I'll be right back dude" and WOOSH--he slips outside and dashes behind the house. "Hey--wait, what now? I thought I was just dropping y--"

"DON'T LEAVE ME, DUDE!" He screamed so loud the whole neighborhood looked my way. Kevin slipped behind the house.

Shit. I glance in every direction and try to look inconspicuous--but it doesn't feel right. Something's just 'off'. 

Just then a black dude walked past me. He glances back over his shoulder and winks at me while slowly dragging his finger across his throat--OR MAYBE HE JUST SMILED POLITELY--the point is-- it was at that moment that I become fully aware of the situation...

I was The Only White Guy in an All Black Neighborhood.

And I was already drawing attention.

I wasn't scared (much). I mean--I was cool, I could hang, I was "down". And like, if any of these nice black gentlemen gave me a hassle, I could quickly explain how my circle of friend was a veritable rainbow coalition of ethnically diverse people. And as if that wasn't enough--I was a big fan of Hip Hop! That would totally win them over.

So between that and my expansive knowledge of Cosby Show trivia, I was super confident that I was safe, because I had all of the "Street Credibility" I needed.

So I did what any white kid would do... I chilled.

That's right--I stayed totally parked, with the engine off, directly in front of what was less likely an Uncle House and more likely a Crack Shack--right in the heart of The Hood. So I cranked up my Onyx tape and pretended to not know all the words while I nodded my head to the beat and waited for Kevin.

But that was only Phase 1. As my level of confidence--fueled by my ignorance--began to elevate, I realized that I may be alienating myself by acting self-involved.

So I initiated Phase 2, which is best summarized by me making eye contact grinning like an idiot at every Black person in my vicinity. And to really kick it up, I'd throw out a soulless 'Peace-Sign/Head-Nod' combo. That really got 'em talking.

Sure... I could have just left. I could have abandoned Kevin. I could have even just driven around the block a few times, and come back later--but all of those options were far to sensible. "Besides"--I thought--"what's the worst thing that can happen??"

Just then I felt something like a flashlight jab me in the guts, accompanied by a deep, Black man's voice say--"Hey, boy".

I looked left and found myself face to face (nearly nose to nose) with a nice person who I will call GOD DAMN. 

Now I never had time to get to know God Damn personally, so this is based purely on his appearance... But to my naive, 18-year-old pea-brain, God Damn was the dark, hulking, physical manifestation of every racist-inspired stereotype I had been told--by other whites and the media--that I should always be afraid of. And it was easy, because God Damn was a scary looking guy.

I felt that Flashlight push further into my stomach fat. I look down... Oh no. That's not a Mag-Lite--that's a gun!

My heart skipped but I never panicked. With hesitating, I blurted out--"Don't shoot me" in a very matter-of-fact way.

"What you got?" He reached in with his other arm and starting slapping my pockets. "Nothing" I replied.

GD: "Where the money at?"

ME: "I don't have any."

GD: "What you here for?"

ME: "I gave this guy a ride. Seriously, don't shoot me, man."

God Damn kinda smiled a little, then looked both ways, pulled the gun barrel out of my gut--"Get the fuck on"--and walked away.

I left. Quickly.

I never went back for Kevin... In fact I only saw him twice after that and didn't even make eye contact.

I still offer rides to friends and even help an occasional stranger with a lift--but I've never been caught slipping again.

Having that guy sneak in and put a gun on me taught me a valuable lesson in the importance of situational awareness.

And I never forget it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, man, that's really cool! (-- zero sarcasm) whenever somebody loves 2001 or Kubrick, it typically indicates that they're good peoples.

I love 2001. It's my #1 favorite film of all time. If you scan my comment history you'll know... I'm street legit. I'm a few years older than you, but 2001 has been my favorite film since I was a kid. Since before I could even grasp the concepts, or verbalize exactly why I loved it--I just knew. I could feel it. Like eating drugs or falling in love. 2001 fascinated me then, and still blows my mind over 30 years later.

FUN FACT: 2001 is RATED G!

I've talked a lot about 2001 over the years, and I've been asked many times--Why?

Why do I like 2001 so much?

I used to try and articulate an answer, but after many years and many talks, rather than rattle off a bullet list of impeccable scenes, break down my unique interpretation of the plot, or detail my "superior" understanding of the deep philosophical concepts... I've distilled my response to this:

2001 explains nothing.

It explores huge theoretical concepts, tackles deeply profound concepts, and stimulate an almost limitless number of questions--

But it answers none of them.

Like all great works of art, the questions are yours to answer, and any deeper meaning is ultimately yours to ascribe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was a Middle School aged young man, I spent parts of my Summer Vacations in rural Minnesota with my Grandparents. Each Summer I had to confront the same Bully who habitually harassed my female cousins.

Now... At this age I wasn't exceptionally tall or strong, but I did have some extra weight on me. More importantly--I was a popular class clown character who wasn't used to being disliked and had never been bullied. So I just typically acted with confidence and didn't have a victim's state of mind. Oh--and I've never been afraid to fight if necessary.

So this dickless little shit (who probably had his own issues as Bullies typically do) was riding up and down the street on his Huffy throwing rocks at the girls. I was inside at the time trying to see Phoebe Cates' boobs on HBO--when my younger, female cousin runs in the house crying. She was also bleeding from a small cut on her forehead.

Just then--TAK!!--the bastard throws a rock at a window (which didn't break somehow). WOOSH!--I leap to my husky feet and run outside in time to see him chuck another rock at the girls. "HEY!" I shouted. He laughed and swung his BMX around and peddled straight for me--"What are you gonna do, Fat Boy?" I stood my ground until the last moment, then hopped to the Left. As he raced by I took a one-two step and--WHAM!!--straight kicked his bike right in the middle (the sweet spot) of his suicide bar! He and the bicycle just tipped the fuck over onto the hard concrete and skidded like 8 feet. He was... Totaled. Done. Laid out moaning. One of the girls (the extra compassionate one) tried to help him up but he cursed her too. U/subject9073: One - Bully: Nill.

7th Grade... Small Community Pool. As I change into my trunks I can already hear ole Loudmouth J Bullykid picking on various kids at the pool, including my younger female cousins and--not kidding--the Liitle Deaf Girl (every small town in MN has one). I quietly walk out to the water, watching him splash and kick and dunk and mock almost every other kid there, and with 'No Life Guard On Duty'--I decided it was my duty to take the Bully down again. So I just waited for my moment... Loudmouth was so wrapped up in his bully endeavors that he never Crazy-Ivaned and checked his 6. But my cousins knew the score... And as they completely clear away from the Bully, so do the others. As Bullworth Loudermouth is calling some 4th Grader a 'Faggot Pussy' for swimming away so quickly, I just launch into an Olympic sprint and leap into the pool--sort of half Cannonball-Jackknifing onto his head--BLOOSH!! Gurgle gurgle... He came up swinging and tried to dunk me but I was slippery like a Whale and buoyant like a Walrus. One rake on the titty from his dirty, gnarled Bully talons underwater was all the motivation I needed to spin and deliver a devestating Mule-Kick to his wee solar plexus. I literally watched the air leave his body. We were mostly in the shallow end so he couldn't have drowned. But after choking on some water and gasping for his breath, he pretended he wasn't crying as he left the pool embarrassed--swearing to exact revenge on us all. U/subject9073: Two - Bully: Nill.

8th Grade - The Final Ultamatum. I am exiting the Church (every small town...) and what do I see?? Little Johnny Ratface Bullymaster! And he's looking fresh off a Spring growth spurt. He's a bit stalkier than I remembered. Well, yadda yadda--I walk outside and the boney little fuck-fangs has my younger cousins 'trapped' inside the prison-like bars of the Handicap Access Rampway. Essentially, he is just fast enough to hop over the railing and race ahead of the young kids, keeping them running back and forth, up and down the ramp. Some of the boys escaped, but of course, Billy Bully Cockface prefers to menace the girls--and was doing just that as I walk outside. The girls scream. I blurt out my obligatory battle cry--"HEY!" He spins and sees me and literally rolls his eyes (one slightly lazy and jaundiced) and laughs and says, "I got you this time Fat Ass". Well--not only was that insult wildly inaccurate (it's well known that I have kind of a flat butt comparatively speaking), but this fuckin bitch didn't even attend service--he showed out specifically to play Scut Farkas on the kids. I was pissed. And I had had enough.

He was making a BIG production out of rolling up his sleeves and prepping for the fight--on the outside of the ramp, balancing on an 8 inch lip of concrete on the other side of the railings... I was right in front of him when he asked--"Are you ready?" I said, "Yep"--he grabs the rail and leaps to swing his legs over and land inside the ramp. While he is literally hanging in mid-air, I punch him in the wrist, breaking his grip and dropping him on top of the top railing mid-leap--CRUNCH! Then he just crumbled and tumbled onto the dirt with a dull THUD! I lobbed my Chubness over the rails and hopped onto the ground next to him.

He actually held his hands out and made a "T", but was to weak to actually call Time Out. Pathetic. I leaned in and shouted something clever like "You better stop picking on us!!" To which he whisper-gasped "Okay okay..." In return.

U/subject9073: Three (The Triple Crown!--The Trifecta!!)

Bully-Tits McGuilicutty: Nothing! ZERO! No Fatalities!!

3 Summers. 3 Wins. Very satisfying.

That was some bad ass shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LOOPER. Despite all of the effort--and taking a healthy dose of dramatic license into account... The fact that this "Crime Syndicate" of the future doesn't have a more foolproof method of killing their targets is SUCH BULLSHIT. These dumb fucks know EXACTLY when and where their targets will materialize--but they haven't figured out how to dig a damn Punji Stick Pit, or lay down something with a trigger like a Claymore, or a fuckin Bear Trap... It's astounding.

And don't get me started on the Amputation/Itstant-Limb-Dematerialization scenes (which are just retarded), or the ending, which is complete bullshit--scientifically and dramatically. Ugh. What a piece of shit.

I get sick of hearing people rave about how mind-blowing it is, or point out that "the guy who made PRIMER consulted on the Time Travel". Whatever. The bottom line is... Primer is a 5-star film. Looper is a 2-star waste. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is literally a Copy/Paste of an Asshole Celeb response I gave a few weeks ago:

I managed a movie theater in Calabasas, CA (a haven for wealthy celebs just outside Los Angeles)... During that time I met nearly every A-List Actor/Director/Producer in Hollywood. Most were very decent people, but I have two stories about unnecessarily mean celebrity assholes:
Gary Sinese--Lieutenant Dan from Forest Gump--was watching a film and got so upset about a volume issue that he stormed into the lobby, charged the concession stand, got in the face of one of my teenaged concession girls and started shouting at her. She burst into tears immediately. I lost my shit for a split second... I rushed over and physically shoved him back and stepped between them. He started to get loud with me and I shouted--"HEY!"--at the top of my lungs, which gets the attention of EVERYBODY in the lobby. I then dressed him down like the bitch he is... I explained that my concession girls didn't get paid to be shouted at--that's what I was there for. Gary's not a very big fella. He calmed the hell down REAL quick, which is good, because seeing my cashier crying got me hot enough to fight. He apologized to me after the show, but I blew him off and told him to find HER and say sorry--which he never did. Dick.
Jessica Simpson was at the concession stand getting snacks with her then husband Nick Lachey before their movie... An utterly adorable little girl (maybe 7 to 9 years old max) very politely approached them, waited for a contientious moment and then sweetly asked if she could "pretty please take a picture" with her. I guess Jessica was not happy with her outfit, because she turns to Nick and says, "I don't knooooow..."--then without ever directly acknowledging the girl--just walked the fuck away, leaving her better half to apologize to the girl and carry all the snacks himself. Cunt.
BONUS STORY: I was driving toward Sony Studios on Culver Blvd and was getting into the turn lane to make a Left on Overland... Out of nowhere this car flies all the way from the far right lane--across 3 lanes of moving traffic--into my lane and swipes my car. The driver is a cute female, but I didn't care--I was pissed. We exchange info. Yadda yadda... I report it to my insurance. That night I get a call from Cute Driver (on a private number which I answered despite knowing better) and--HER SISTER. They proceed to let me know what an asshole I was for reporting the accident and then threatened to make up their own bullshit claim on me--and then fucking laugh and hang up. Well... Cute Driver must have forgotten that I snapped a cell phone pic of her Driver's License, Face, and Car/License Plate... The cute driver was ANNALYNNE MCCORD from the 90210 TV remake. BITCH! Luckily the story does not end there...
So... I am very pissed at this point. I realize that she gave me her cell number, which I use to look up her address online. And unfortunately for her--OOPS!!--my buddy is an Editor on TMZ. I published everything I had on her (phone, address, DL pic, Car/plate pic, etc) to my FaceBook and Twitter feeds and then sold my story to TMZ. Turns out the scuff Mark she left on my car rubbed off with a wet rag, so along with the $2000+ insurance check (which went right I to the bank), I actually netted over $3000 and have a pretty good story to share. Win! </TEXT>

But it is a fairly standard Yakuza/Tride plot/story with some stylized direction--right up until the last few minutes where things get very fucking surreal. SPOILER ALERT... The two main adversaries finally face off, but after riddling each other with bullets, they each refuse to die--and force themselves back to their feet. At this point, the Cop reaches behind his back and pulls out a massive rocket launcher... The Gangster reaches inside his own chest and pulls out the glowing orb that is his heart... The Cop fires the rocket... The Gangster baseball pitches his glow-ball-heart... The rocket and glow-heart collide--

It isn't perfect... If I could surgically excise Igor--I mean, Keifer Sutherland--from this movie, I would cut him the fuck out with ZERO hesitation.

I would also remove William Hurt completely or make him emote with CG technology. What a worthless piece of shit actor.

Other than that--great flick. A definite visual influence on The Matrix. Watch it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well--Damn.

I haven't checked Reddit in a couple days and this post got some upvotes.

Okay... To try and provide some further detail...

My girlfriend and I are getting an apartment together. The new complex we are moving into accidentally cashed our deposit checks a day early and as a result, the checking account linked to my debit card was overdrawn by a few dollars. I do not use credit under any circumstances. Never. So I have no other cards beside my debit card. And I happened to not be carrying any cash on me.

Backstory--my work team meets at this particular coffee shop once a week for a meeting. I have interacted with this Barista many times. We are not friends--but he knows I'm a regular who always buys something.

As it happens, the majority of my team beat me to the meeting and were sitting down when I arrived. They watched me walk up to the counter, place my order and swipe my card. And I could tell at least one of them was curious about where my usual drink was, because they asked me if the Barista was "brewing a fresh pot"? Which I just kind of affirmed without saying yes.

Shortly thereafter he walked over with my usual drink and handed it to me while apologizing for the wait. It played perfectly. In fact, I almost felt rude for not being more appreciative right then--but he caught me off guard. I was not expecting a random act of kindness.

On my way out that morning... I made sure I made eye contact with him and held my empty cup in the air and gave him a big head nod and smile.

The next day (pay day)... I went back over and ordered the same drink I always do. He actually didn't ring me up, but I spotted him, walked over and gave him a $20 and said "good lookin out yesterday". He tried to refuse the tip but I persisted and he went ahead and took it. I felt great.

**EDIT:** I forgot how cynical Reddit is. I didn't take any pictures to prove anything because I just don't think like that. You'll just have to take my word for it. But it was an awesome experience and I'm glad I got to share it here. Thanks for the upvotes. </TEXT>

In the first five minutes, Frank Castle  decapitates an old man, stabs his wife in the head, breaks a guys arm so the bone is sticking out and then STABS THE GUY IN THE HEART with his own arm-bone, kicks a chair leg into a guys eye socket, does a flying-spinning headbutt and hangs upside down from a chandelier and shoots like 100 fucking people.

That is just the opening scene. It gets more ridiculous.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't really comment on reddit logic... Is there such a thing? Sounds like an oxymoron. I just like funny stuff.

Having said that--I think he did the right thing.

History is full of examples of "Rule Breakers" that ultimately end up justified in their actions. I can't believe I'm going to do this, but I am... The entire American Revolution was an act of rebellion. They broke many laws. We wouldn't even be redditing right now if they hadn't done it. So for whatever it's worth, I'm glad that the spying was exposed. Even if a guy had to break his contract to get it done.

<TEXT> I have managed 4 different movies theaters... 22 screens, 10 screens, and two 6 screens--this would not work. It would kill my payroll and crush any hope of a P L bonus.

At both my 6 screens we very frequently operated on a skeleton crew of literally 3 people. 1 Box Office Cashier, 1 Connectionist/Usher and 1 Manager floating between all positions while also playing the role of Projectionist.

So normally I would be available in the box office to help sell tickets. We tear the tickets as we sell eliminating the need for an Usher at the door. Then I high-tail it across the lobby to the Concession stand where I help bag popcorn and pour sodas. Then I run upstairs somewhere near the correct time and start the projector (threading first if it's a film print and not digital). Then come back down and repeat the process until movies start getting out, at which point I have Box Office keep an eye ion things while me and the Connectionist go clean the theater for the next show.

Every corporate owned theater chain has similar staffing policies. They will expect you to operate with as minimal staff as possible. The 3-MAN Skeleton Crew system had already been established at the first 6 screen I took over and the District Manager flat-out told me that he wanted it to continue. When I moved to another 6 screen, I was asked to implement the same system there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> PEPPERONI CHIPS:

Place 3 paper towels on a paper plate (THIS IS ESSENTIAL).

Make a spiral of Hormel Pepperoni slices, slightly overlapping, until the entire plate is cover in pepperoni.

Microwave for 2 minutes.

The Pepperoni will crisp up and have a crunch just like a potato chip.

<TEXT> To be honest... I'd have to say it's a toss up between Blade and Iron Man.

For those who can't remember... Blade was awesome. So awesome in fact that we can essentially thank it for ushering in the modern era of Marvel films. It performed well at the box office and made money on DVD. Plus it's Rated R. And unashamedly so. The blood and gore are awesome, the fights are sweet and Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff are at the tops of their games.

Iron Man is just pure fun. Period. Joy and action. They really got the casting right, and that--as much as anything--makes it great. The story isn't perfect--but the tone and the direction overcome the narrative flaws and make it irresistible. I rarely meet anybody who didn't enjoy it.

The Avengers would be a close 3rd--but I have a tendency to prefer individual vs team stories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My bad... I clarified this in another comment somewhere in here... It's mostly LA movies that blatantly reference Hollywood people and the Industry.

In some cases, though, directors choose to use the city of LA like a character, and that sometimes bothers me as well.

Die Hard is not an LA movie. Collateral is. Does that make sense? Die Hard is also the greatest action film ever made (*fuck you, people who think Ghost Protocol is the best*)--so it's impossible to hate.

Pulp Fiction is about 50% jerk-offy... But it gets a pass because it's strengths definitely outweigh that particular annoyance. However--Jackie Brown does not get a pass. Does that makes sense?

Similarly, Bogie Nights gets a pass... But 2 Days in the Valley does not. I realize this is insanely subjective--I'm just trying to clarify my opinion. It's a fine line in my mind between good and suck.

LA Confidential is totally an LA movie... But because of the historical setting, and (like Pulp Fiction and Boogie Nights) the overall awesomeness of the film, I give it a pass. Gangster Squad on the other hand is a failure.

Finally Mulholland Drive... An LA movie for sure, BUT--made by David Lynch. Love him or hate him, it's going to be a mind-scrambler. Although I personally do not like Mulholland Drive, it's not because of the LA thing. I do hate Justin Theroux as well, but I can tolerate him in this. The truth is, if I ever direct a hollywood feature, I will blatantly steal 2 shots from Mulholland Drive and brag about my theft.

To encapsulate how I feel I can sum it up by mentioning the  most offensive LA Jerk-Off of all time... A little TV show you may have heard of called Entourage. A show where everything always works out for everybody and we get to see how things "really work" in the city of angels. Where people without real jobs never worry about money or relationships, and where life is better than anyplace else in the world. Fuck off, Hollywood. Suck your own dick in private like I do.

The "Industry" already has enough self-gratification throughout the year... And every award season they get to gather in groups and circle-jerk each other off. I would prefer it if they limited their jerking to off-screen. It's kind of like when Puff Daddy used to say "Bad Boy" in the background of every Notorious BIG song... It's like--just produce the record and stay the fuck off the track, bitch. That's how I feel whenever I smell insider LA material in a film.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know... I liked Drive a lot--but I didn't love it. And to me it wasn't as guilty of being an LA stroke-fest. What I really wanted was to surgically excise Albert Brooks from the film completely and then add one more car chase in the 3rd act.

I should really expand that comment to include anything that references the industry. There's nothing worse than a movie about a struggling screenwriter--as an example. No, I didn't particularly like Adaptation, even though it wasn't a bad film.

I'll give you a harder to spot example that drove me nuts... Inglourious Basterds... The Nazi Officer is talking to the Blonde Jewish girls while she hangs letters on the theater marquee and she says something like "I'm French... Here in France we respect our Directors"--it's almost as if Quentin Tarantino should have just stepped into frame and delivered that line himself.

I guess I just hate how Hollywood loves to pat itself on the back and suck it's own cock as if anything they do is important.

Worst LA movie of all time... LA Story. Fuck that movie.

<TEXT> Bill Murray is at his best when he's part of an ensemble cast--Ghostbusters and Rushmore being good examples.

As a "star" or "leading Man" the only 2 films I like of his are Groundhog Day and Scrooged (although Scrooged has a dumb ending). I would rather be water-boarded than have to watch What About Bob? or Lost In Translation again.

I 100% agree that his reputation is overrated. And I think it has a lot to do with his persona outside acting. </TEXT>

I've posted very similar sentiments in the past regarding Big Lebowski and have received a lot of support.

I won't say that it sucks--in fact, John Tutoro makes me laugh out loud... But the rest of the movie is like a big inside joke jerk off about LA. And I hate LA movies.

In fact, I just moved away from Los Angeles and I hate them even more.

<TEXT> I'm not a troll or a hater. I like it. I just don't love it. But it's a breathtaking film to look at for sure.

I have actually seen it many times as a "grown up". I did Blu-ray QC for many years, and I was the project manager for the 5-disc Complete Collector's Edition Blade Runner release (with 5 versions of the film).

After watching each version multiple times (including the fucking work print) I came to the conclusion that my personal favorite version would be an as-yet-to-be-created Fan Edit using the newest "Final Cut" version (2007) but mixing in Dekkard's voiceover from the International Cut (1982).

I admit it. I like the voiceover. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You might be crazy. Cheese is awesome.

And you can develop a palette for it like Scotch or Wine.

Start with something like String Cheese (which is just Mozzarella).

Experiment with mild cheeses like Emmental, Leicester, Cream Havarti, etc.

Make a move to Medium (semi-hard) cheeses like Swiss, Colby, Monterey Jack, Gouda, Provelone and Cheddar.

Cheddar is your gateway cheese into the harder stuff.

Work your way up to a nice Sharp Cheddar. Then take the leap to aged Cheddar. If you can eat a 5 year aged Sharp Cheddar, you should be able to tolerate numerous other "strong" cheeses.

Before long, you'll be snobbing it up at Wine   Cheese parties, noshing on Brie, Camembert, Stilton, Limburger and Roquefort. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Managed a 22 screen Movie Theater for the better part of a decade.

My favorite story is the time one of my Ushers called me to report some theater "hoppers". I go down to investigate and it turns out to be 2 guys in those Olympic Racing Wheelchairs. Their arms were freaking bulging with muscle even though their little legs had atrophied. I clearly see them roll out of one auditorium and just wheel on over to another.

I shout "Hey!"

Without a second of hesitation one of them screams "GO GO GO!" and they blaze down the hall and smash out of the back exit. I didn't even bother chasing them. I was too impressed. I just turned to my Usher and said--

"Let 'em go. They earned it." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I swear I'm not trolling or commenting just to be contrary... But every single comment in here is praising this film and I just have to say--I think it's awful.

The director (Paul W.S. Anderson) is a complete hack who is only responsible for one entertaining and watchable film--Soldier (notice I didn't say it was a good film).

Event Horizon is a great example of Horror films that began appearing in the late 80's and early 90's that focused more on momentarily shocking the audience with a FLASH on screen and a STING on the soundtrack. It's not like The Shining or The Exorcist where you return from the theater and walk into your dark house afraid of what might be there. You leave Event Horizon and forget about 99% of it.

The story is so puerile in its imbecilic cosmology that it ends up shackled by it's vague concepts and half-assed pseudo-science. It's as if he pitched the studio on a 50/50 mix of Alien and Hellraiser and tossed in some Black Hole mumbo jumbo without even bothering to do some Wikipedia research. 

As far as the execution, it didn't look awful--but the neither did Alien Vs. Predator or The Three Musketeers. In fact all of his films have a flashy gloss about them, but they all suck. He's like a less talented/successful version of Michael Bay. With Event Horizon he utterly failed to deliver anything close to original or frightening.

I can understand being frightened by this movie when you were young, but try it again as an adult and I think the cracks will show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, dumb-fuck-- I wasn't writing off the victim. That was huge conclusion for you to jump to. And considering that fact that I'm obviously advocating *for* the victim, your hostility is unwarranted.

When I wrote that post I was thinking of my great aunt who was molested as a 8 year old girl. She was haunted by it her whole life until the day she died. And she had all of the help in the world... Years of therapy, etc. Nobody ever wrote her off. It affected every relationship she ever had including her relationship with her own children. She never trusted anyone, and by all accounts she was the nicest young girl in the family until after her victimization. It's a sad story.

So I'm happy for you. I'm glad you're living (or are on your way to living) a "normal life". But it's unfortunate that you can only see things from your own perspective. Your experience is unique to you. Other people have things better/worse and deal with it differently--regardless of the "help" they receive.

My post wasn't an expression of an attitude, it was an expression of a fact. I know someone who was a lifetime victim of abuse that occurred in their childhood. Period. Your point is nullified.

You singled out the first sentence of my post... If you'd continued to read you would see that 99% of what I said related to punishment for the crime.

With regard to how the Child Predator is punished--to me it doesn't matter how well the victim does after his/her victimization. The fact that a kid now has to seek help in order to live a normal life is enough for me to want the Predator dead. They should not get another chance to victimize another child. Period. So you've actually reaffirmed that point in my eyes. No child should have to be a victim. No child should have to seek help to get over being victimized. The crime continues after the initial transgression. The Predator should die. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a crime for life. That kid will be affected forever.

And for me it's simple logic--

Even if you believe in prison rehabilitation (which, in the case of child predators I absolutely do not), anybody with common sense has to acknowledge the reality that a certain % of so-called rehabilitated prisoners will re-offend.

In the case of a non-violent home burglar or car thief I am willing to take that gamble and give them multiple chances to turn their lives around. I'm not willing to give child predators a chance to offend again.

This should be the number one reason we execute prisoners. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all-- is this really a problem? I understand it's sometimes annoying, but is it really that big of a deal?

Second of all-- Are you kidding? The average theater chain could give a fuck about sound. As far as they're concerned, loud = good.

I used to manage a 22 Screen Movie Theater-- A large popcorn starts out as roughly 11 cents worth of raw popcorn seed. Factor in labor and materials (bucket/bag, butter, etc), it cost between 75 cents and $1 to package a large popcorn which is sold for $6-$7. Do that math real quick.

Rest assured... Any snack available for you to purchase at a major theater chain (Regal, Amc, Cinemark, etc) was selected by a corporate number cruncher with a spreadsheet, and that snack is going to be a cost effective product with an outrageous potential for mark-up--that's specifically why Johnny Number-Crunch picked it.

Candy? Look how cheap it is at Target compared to the multiplex.

Straying slightly from topic... Why is snack money so important to a theater? Because they've stopped making any money on the ticket sales (it's based on a sliding scale where a movie has to play for a long time for the theater to start making a % of the door). In order to make up for the lost ticket revenue, they have slowly (over the last 4 decades) increased the profit margin on the food.

In my humble opinion... People need to stop expecting perfection when they go out to the cinema. It's a communal experience where laughter, screams of terror, whispers and candy crunching are all part of the fun. Cell Phones are a much bigger problem than popcorn.

If you like total quiet, invest in a kick ass home theater and stay home eating soft foods. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Proposition was good.

Assassination of Jesse James was good.

True Grit and Django were good.

3:10 to Yuma remake was a bit of a disappointment.

Cowboys   Aliens sucked.

But none of them were great. Not like Once Upon a time in the West, or Outlaw Josey Wales. That's why I believe the Western genre has suffered more than Horror.

But you hit the nail on the head... They aren't making very many Westerns anymore, and the ones they make are typically Hollywood affairs--which typically means too much production and too high of a budget.

It might sound crazy, but back when it was a busier genre, many of the Westerns we think of as "the greatest of all time" were actually modestly budgeted features with actors who were NOT the most famous of their era.

Clint Eastwood became a western icon BECAUSE of his work with Sergio Leone. But he became a legend when he followed Leone's example and continued to make gritty, low-to-medium-budgeted features (High Plains Drifter, Josey Wales, etc.).

Westerns used to be so big that the genre itself was divided into multiple sub-genres (Epic, Spaghetti, Revisionist, Comedy, Science Fiction)--and while these sub-genres technically still exist today--we're lucky to just get one solid Western per year.

Even with the small resurgence in the mid-90's and last few years, Western films are few and far between and the great ones are very hard to come by.

The truth is, the audience isn't there anymore. That and the many truths and myths about the era have been exposed with contemporary hindsight. I guess it makes the whole genre less appealing for the majority. And the producers and number-crunchers know the formulas on how to make money with movies. A successful Western nowadays is going to have to be high concept and include 2 or 3 A-List actors, making the cost/benefit ratio suffer.

To go from being one of the biggest genres in the industry to being so heavily marginalized in the era of spreadsheet cinema is sad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **The Western**. Much more so than Horror.

Even with occasional "good" movies like Django Unchained (*which I only liked--I didn't love*)... The Western used to be a staple of Hollywood cinema, and has dramatically faded.

The 70's was the last great era for the Western. Since then, there have only been a handful of truly great Westerns made (Unforgiven, Tombstone and the TV show Deadwood to name a few).

If you look at any TOP 100 list for Westerns, the overwhelming majority (like 95%) were all produced during or before the 1970's. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not an action adventure, but--

**THE LAST AMERICAN VIRIGN**

This has to be the best example of a movie that literally yanks the rug out from under the lead character in the final moments of the film. It starts off as a raunchy, 80's teen comedy and then...

SPOILER: The main character, Gary, has a huge crush on the the hot girl Karen (Monique from Better Off Dead). His more attractive friend Rick (Troy from The Goonies) swoops in and fucks Karen, gets her pregnant and then splits. So Gary spends the entire third act helping Karen get an abortion and then being there for her in her time of need. Karen invites Gary to her birthday party. He shows up with a gold necklace ready to confess his love for Karen, BUT--he catches Karen making out with Troy. He leaves crying and drives away in tears. Then the movie ends. And he never even lost his virginity!

<TEXT> First things first... eat 2 meals per day.

Meal 1 = Breakfast = **Oatmeal**. Always oatmeal. It is dirt cheap and will fill you up.

Meal 2 = Dinner = **Chili Mac   Cheese**:

* 4 boxes of generic (store-brand) Macaroni   Cheese.
* 1/2 pound of cheap ground beef
* Margarine
* 1 Quart Milk
* McCormick Chili Seasoning
* Hot Sauce

Directions:

Make the Mac   Cheese by following the directions on the box.

Brown the ground beef. Add the Chili Seasoning halfway through. Drain the fat if you want.

Add the beef to the Mac   Cheese and combine. That should easily last you 5 nights for dinner with a few servings for an optional lunch/snack.

OPTIONS: **Steal**. Fuck it. Steal the McCormick Chili Seasoning. Steal a small block of Velveeta. That's right--I said steal. Steal the hot sauce. Steal anything you can fit in your pocket that doesn't have a security tag. Just don't get caught like a dumb-ass.

Adding some creamy Velveeta to this recipe makes it wonderful. And you can use the money you saved on Chili Seasoning and Hot Sauce to buy fruit and Jello. Then you can make a fuckin kick ass Jello Fruit salad and have that for dessert/snacks all week.

Don't like stealing? You could also go legit and consider buying a **Stouffer's *Party Sized* Beef Lasagna** from Target--They are $10-$11 dollars and have 12 portions. That's lunch and dinner for 6 days with money leftover or Oatmeal.

<TEXT> Situations can ruin a good film.

I remember when a group of my friends wanted to watch a comedy that nobody had seen... They wanted to watch Hot Shots part Deux. I made them all watch Brazil. Yikes. They hated it.

Since then many of them have revisited it and really enjoyed it.

I suggest getting either drunk or high (whichever you prefer) and have ing a double feature of Murder By Death and Clue. Both are clever murder mystery spoofs with their own little twists. And when you're finished you can weigh in on the age old debate of which one is better. </TEXT>

And I don't want to sound sexist... But there is an extra layer of danger in the air when a group of isolated men become paranoid and suspicious of one another.

<TEXT> I think it's Nolan's best film. It's the only one of his I've bothered to buy on Blu-ray.

But even I have to say, the "twist" is more of a shift in genre. The closing shot is necessary, and it's effective... But it's also predictable.

Still an awesome film. Some of Jackman and Bale's best work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for saying this, **Stryyder**.

Having already familiarized myself with the facts about Columbine, I couldn't help but roll my eyes at the obvious attempt to countermand what the NRA said today.

I'm not a gun owner and I don't typically like the NRA, but their logic is hard to argue with--especially when the lives of children may be at stake.

It doesn't matter which guns are banned. Crazy people will use knives if they have no other option. But more than likely they will just use unregistered firearms which they've acquired illegally (after all, if you plan on shooting up a school--a gun violation is a small time crime by comparison).

Since we KNOW it's possible for a criminal to acquire guns, I still want trained and armed individuals in the schools, even if the bans are enacted. Just acknowledging that possibility makes it the prudent thing to do in order to protect the kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sunshine might be one of the biggest disappointments I have ever experienced watching a film.

For the first 2 acts, I was 100% on board and completely engrossed in the narrative--but then... The third act happens, and some truly stupid writing basically ruins the entire film. The whole third act sucks and as a result, the movie as a whole ends up being pretty awful.

I will say this... If any of the characters had looked into the camera and said "It's daylight savings time" I would probably like it twice as much as I do now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Theatrical Edit of Donnie Darko is the best version of the film. Period.

The Director's cut was such a mess, that I realized Richard Kelly had (like many one-hit director's before him) accidentally made a great movie--aka the Theatrical Version.

When I finally saw his "preferred version" of the film... It was obvious that he was a average filmmaker who had gotten lucky through a series of circumstances-- like being limited by budget, being forced to change the music because of rights, etc. the end result of all of those changes and compromises was a truly great movie.

When most people catch lightening in a bottle they don't jinx it. They hold it sacred. But the truly arrogant will spit in the face of a cult hit and make an absurd amount of "hind sight" changes and re-release the film for what is essentially a cash grab (like George Lucas with Star Wars).

I mean-- calling it a "Director's Cut" is basically a marketing ploy, because the Director's Cut of Donnie Darko never existed. The only main difference between the Theatrical Edit and the Original Film Festival Edit was the order of the music-- which was rearranged theatrically when they couldn't secure the rights for "Never Tear Us Apart". And the commentary on the DVD featured Richard Kelly and--KEVIN SMITH?? Kevin Smith who had nothing to do with the production and played no role in it's success. Marketing.

The Theatrical Edit is a movie that can be watched by 10 friends who can all walk away with 10 different takes on what exactly happened. The Director's Cut is a much more obvious film that really spells things out for the audience. Not to mention, the music in the Theatrical version is MUCH better. No question.

And what has Kelly done since? SOUTHLAND TALES-- a ridiculous, over-indulgent, absurdly unentertaining piece of shit--which is most interesting to watch as an exercise in what NEVER to do if you direct a movie. With that budget, that cast and those resources-- there is NO EXCUSE for not making a more decent film. He proved to me that he is a bullshit director. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-10-04 02:22:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have never found more than $20 at one time... But it happened twice under drastically different circumstances:

Back in the day when I was always **poor**, I had to make an emergency drive from Miami to Orlando and I had to get there fast. I had already gotten onto a Toll Road when I realized I hadn't scraped enough change together to pay all the tolls. As I went through one of the stops, the driver in front of me dropped a dollar bill and drove away. I assumed it was a single. I pulled forward and realized that it was a crisp $20 bill-- and it was about to blow out of my reach. Just then, I spotted neighboring toll collector leave his booth to also try and chase down the money. I quickly opened the door and snatched it up. He shouted "I saw it first" but it was too late. I was gone. Not only did that pay the tolls, but it got me some gas and food.

Nowadays I make decent living... About 4 months ago I found a $20 bill somebody had accidentally left at the ATM (*automated bank teller machine -- for everybody's benefit*). It was around midnight. I didn't see it in the dispenser until I was already waiting for my requested cash to be dispensed, so I took it, walked right outside the vestibule and handed it to a homeless couple. They looked hungry and I didn't need the extra cash. Even if they just bought meth, it felt good to give it away.

I'M SURE SOMEBODY ON REDDIT CAN BEAT BOTH OF THESE STORIES! </TEXT>

<TEXT> America is not in denial, my friend.

Just think of it like this... With so many fat people watching television, why are there so few fat people represented ON television. The answer is-- even the obese are more interested in observing attractive people than they are in watching other fat people.

That same attitude permeates all aspects of life.  No matter how many of us there are (*and I'm including myself because I'm fat*), the ideal human form will never be an obese one.

I will admit, it is amusing to see how making fun of racial stereotypes or sexual preference is now very much taboo, but it is still completely acceptable to make fun of the overweight.

I'd say, get used to it or lose weight. The whole world isn't much different with regard to the way the obese are treated.

***OH YEAH*** and I think that 90% statistic is a little off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain** by Willie Nelson

(*written by Fred Rose and originally performed by Roy Acuff-- but made famous by Nelson on his album* Red Headed Stranger)

This was historically the song that my Father always insisted should be played at his funeral. And we did. He died when I was 18.

It's a simple, little ditty about a man who left his love and will always remember her 'blue eys crying in the rain' and someday they will meet again, etc.

But to me, this is just a sweet song about the inevitability of loss and the possibility of reunion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No offense, but at this stage of the game this is essentially a non-issue.

HERE IS HOW TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IN ONE SWIFT STEP:

You or somebody older and bigger than the 15 year old shit just needs to grab him by the fucking shoulders and shake the shit out of him while putting the fear of Jesus H God into his little 15 year old brain. Let him know that if he wants to act like a pervert, he just scored his ONE FREEBIE. If you guys ever catch him again, he will be reported to the authorities, and if he fucks with your Sister again, he goes to the Emergency Room and walks with a severe limp the rest of his life.

SIMPLE!

FYI... A 15 year old acting horny and irresposnible with a camera is NOT UNUSUAL. But you still have an obligation to protect your Sister. So fuck him. Don't ruin his life, but don't let him mess with your Sister or any other girls. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **DVincee** has the best advice by far.

I was YOU, **xStimorolx**, at a point not very long ago, and I have been able to almost completely overhaul my life by taking BABY STEPS.

When I wanted to change the way I was eating, I started by eliminating all deep-fired carbs. That was it. Then I replaced diet soda with water. And just like **DVincee** said, a third step happened so naturally that it started a trend, and I now eat much healthier.

When I wanted to keep a cleaner household, I started by doing ONE THING... Running the vacuum cleaner once every 2 weekends. Of all the household chores, vacuuming is my favorite so I focused on that, which led to me vacuuming once a week, which inspired me to keep shit off the floor, which inspired me to keep other surfaces free of clutter, which eventually led to me ACTUALLY DUSTING. Holy shit.

Do not overwhelm yourself. Pinpoint something super easy and make that your first wee, little, baby step. You might have to get 3 or 4 steps in before it becomes automatic, but it WILL BECOME AUTOMATIC.

And then you win! </TEXT>

I am not really a sweet tooth person... I always prefer salty/fatty snacks to sweet.

And I have always wondered about things like PH balance being a better indicator for how often one should brush... One rule for everybody never seems to work. So to hear you say 2 or 3 days provided brushing is done properly makes total sense.

I just keep thinking about proto-humans and primates. They had/have no modern oral hygine, and yet they didn't/don't have an epidemic of dental issues... Of course... They didn't consume any refined sugar. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's so contrary to the way we've been brought up (*i.e. go to the dentist every 6 months*) but I actually believe this.

I also think that over-brushing and self-whitening cannot be good for enamel.

It makes me sound crazy, but I won't go to a doctor uinless I'm really sick either... In my opinion, you can walk into a Doctor's office healthy and walk out sick. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dentists of Reddit 
I don't take exceptional care of my teeth and I never have... Why have I never had a cavity? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-21 22:54:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am a 35 year old man and I have never had a cavity. I've never even experienced a toothache. I brush my teeth 2-3 times a week and I never floss. I also routinely bite my nails and chew ice (which I have done since I was a kid).

How 'normal' is this? Why am I so lucky??


I have a few theories:

**A. Good genetics**-- The problem with that idea is that nobody else in my family has good teeth. My paretns and Grandparents all had cavities in their early to mid-twenties, and they all had much better oral hygine discipline than I do.

**B. I drank a shit load of milk gorwing up**-- But I don't really belive that the calciuim from milk would make my teeth that much stronger.

**C. I have my own set of dental picks**-- And I've had them for years... So I have never allowed tarter or plaque to build up oon my teeth.

**D. I have gaps between my teeth**-- I have always had small spaces between most of my teeth, so there isn't a lot of room for tarter build up. Also, I have no wisdom teeth, so they never pushed my teeth closer together becuase they never came in.

**EDIT:** I have also only been to see a dentist 3 times in my life... Twice when I was in middle school and 1 time 6 months ago.  I only went because I have great Dental benefits and I never use them, so somebody suggested I get a cleaning. It was at that visit that they conformed I have no wosdom teeth and they were shocked at how good my teeth looked when I told them I hadn't seen a dentist in over 20 years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have slept in my tidey whities only my whole life. I never understood pajamas and why people wore them.

The same thing with slippers... It never occured to me (until I grew up) that pajamas are worn to keep sheets clean and slippers are supposed to keep your feet clean.

To me... Pajamas and Slippers were things that made your body and feet warm. And I never wanted to be warm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to take the rings you peel off from gallons of milk and toss them behind our family fridge.

One year during Spring cleaning my Mom found them all and freaked out.

The best part was... After she threw them away, I pulled them out of the garbage and kept them until Christmas and stuffed them inside her stocking. Brilliant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You seem like you might be more interested in a forum to express your reasons for disagreeing that 2001 is a great film-- as the majority of people seem to enjoy it. And I can appreciate that. There is nothing worse than not liking a movie that everyone else seems to love. I have the same issue currently with The Dark Knight Rises.

If you're really interested in learning about why 2001 is so well respected, it is a topic that has been discussed to death for almost 50 years-- [CHECK THIS SHIT OUT](http://www.google.com/#hl=en sugexp=les%3Beqrwrth gs_nf=1 qe=MjAwMSBhIHNwYWNlIG9keXNzZXkgYQ qesig=yaTowSjmS72N1Tca1dmj5w pkc=AFgZ2tnnZehHNM5HOKo8_q_idKcSqrQhFnTWGi9UpAviuE1_vXUEpfxRXo1mqo_SzeDiKTpg-hWiZnkbzHJFouK9KBfDE91P8w cp=22 gs_id=11 xhr=t q=2001+a+space+odyssey+analysis pf=p safe=off sclient=psy-ab oq=2001+a+space+odyssey+a gs_l= pbx=1 bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf. fp=b07c58d71b392d97 biw=1284 bih=897)

The fact is, there a few films in history that have been studied and analyzed as much as 2001... So if you really think you're missing something, there are a ton of resources available. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a theater we used to go to back in high school-- a 10 screen multiplex--and the rumor was that a man had died in Auditorium # 10 and it was haunted. I have never really believed in ghosts--at least not like in the stories or movies--so I never really paid much attention.

FF several years and I find myself working at this place, and of course the rumors still persist. Not only is auditorium # 10 haunted, but many of the employees had strange stories to tell.  I just couldn't give a shit. One night we were closing the place down. We had already walked from theater to theater to make sure there were no people hiding and everybody else had left for the night.

I was threading the projectors for the next day and I came to projector #10. As I was threading, I glanced over to the booth porthole down into auditorium #10 and I saw a gentleman stand up from his seat and walk out of the theater!! I freaked the fuck out, grabbed a pipe and ran downstairs. There was nobody there!

We have sensors on all of the doors and windows, none of them were opened during that time. I checked. So if somebody was really in there, they spent the night and hid themselves from the multiple motion sensors we had in every auditorium.

I think the most likely explanation is that I was tired and my mind was playing tricks on me... But it was interesting that it happened while I was near #10.

Despite this, I still do not believe in spirits and ghosts.

Has this ever happened to any other skeptics? Did it change how you feel about ghosts?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> FOREIGN FILMS 

I prefer to watch any "action" oriented movies with an English audio dub rather than watching with subtitles. This drive many of my cinema-nerd friends up the fucking wall.

The best example is CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON. They talk a lot during the fight scenes, and it sucks having to look away from what is happening to read words at the bottom of the screen. Plus the dub on Crouching Tiger is really good--that helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to work a 7pm to 5am shift. During these hours the overnight cleaning staff cleaned the bathrooms. Every now and again I would need to go to the bathroom and they would have it "sectioned-off" so we couldn't use it while they were cleaning.

This one particular night I had some "issues" with my butt and I was taking frequent, URGENT shits. The third time I felt a rumble in my guts I wobbled down the hall to the Men's room and found it "**CLOSED FOR CLEANING**". This typically meant that I would have to either wait or try to go to a different floor. The problem was, our access cards only really worked on our floor (although it was possible to sneak around if you had time), and I didn't think I could hold out for the cleaning people to finish.

At this time, the third shift was exclusively male-- there were no females at all. So I hatched a genius plan... I DECIDED TO TAKE A SHIT IN THE WOMEN'S ROOM.

Aside from the rotten twat stink (*which is apparently permanently burned into the walls in all Ladies restrooms*), it was just like a Men's Room without Urinals. So I got comfy in the handicapped stall and unloaded.

At the peak of my shit, the door swings open and two girls I know from the second shift walk in. Apparently they were working late as a favor for somebody. They used the bathroom and then started talking to each other. OH MY GOD they talked forEVER! At a certain point, they realized there was a third person in the bathroom with them. I WAS TRAPPED! They started whispering to each other and left. I wiped my ass and snuck back to my office.

The next day there was a big inner-office memo posted about NOT using the wrong bathrooms. And they had figured out it was me but were to embarrassed to say anything. It took me a while to get over that one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back when we were just wee teenagers, a buddy and I were driving back to his place on a Saturday afternoon and a couple of Bro-Dudes cut us off. We shouted something clever (*like "fuck you!"*), swerved in front of them and tried to race away, but they sped up and followed us all the way back to my buddy's house.

We jumped out of the car. I ran inside and grabbed his Dad's unloaded .357 revolver and ran back out just as the Bro-Dudes arrived. They jumped out of their sports car and started shouting at my buddy (*and these guys were freaking huge*) so I popped out and pointed the gun at them and told them to get the fuck away. They were like "*Yo! Chill out*" and "*Calm down*" etc.

A moment later they apologized and asked us if we smoked weed. We did. So they rolled a joint and we smoked it with them.

We learned that they were just basically twenty-something versions of us (they had grown up in the area and gone to the same schools we had, etc). They ended up being really cool guys.

Right before we parted company, the driver Bro-Dude waved me over to his car and said he wanted to show me something-- and he pulled a **9MM** out from under his driver's seat. He said "The only difference between mine and yours is that mine is loaded. You should never point a gun at anybody unless you're ready for a gunfight".

I've never pointed a gun at anybody else in my whole life and I probably never will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was a kid, there was another boy in the neighborhood who was always bragging about how much money his parents had and about all the cool stuff they owned. We'll call him BILLY. Needless to say, we stopped playing with Billy because of said douchery.

But our neighborhood was basically one big circle so we were always riding our bikes passed their house. When we would NOT say hello to him, his parents would say things very loudly (obviously so we could hear) like "It's okay, Billy, they're just jealous." We were not jealous.

But they basically became militant about the fact that none of the kids in the neighborhood liked their son. His mom would even spray us with their water hose if we used the sidewalk in front of their house.

Please note: We never picked on Billy because he was bigger than all of us (even though he was the same age). We just stopped asking him to play with us.

Anyway... FF several months... We were playing in the street NEAR their house (not in front, but near). Billy came out and told us to leave. Their were a bunch of us so I told him to fuck off. He went inside and got his mom. She came out and told us to leave, and we all told her to fuck off too. So she ordered Billy to "get over there" and make us leave.

He marched right towards me-- and I'm not sure what his plan was or what he was expecting, but he was almost 6 inches taller than me and looked pretty menacing-- AND he was talking shit the whole way about beating the crap about me.
As soon as he got within arms reach of me I just beat the fucking shit out him-- and it only took about 8-10 seconds. He was on the concrete screaming and his Mom ran over and shoulder-rammed me onto the ground, then stood over me and screamed at me for beating Billy up.

I was so shocked I couldn't even tell her it was all her fault.

Some parents are just fucking weird. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a little hit high and it was late, and I was in a sub-reddit about gay/lesbian tax reform in germany, and I made a tastless joke-- something to the effect of: "Too bad they started both world wars and killed all those jews because nobody care about their progressive social reform". It was a touch below the belt. Perhaps I shouldn't have said it, but I did. Needless to say this was not a popular comment. But I owned it.

FF a couple weeks... I realize people are still downvoting my comment. So I deleted it. I'm not really ashamed of what I said... I tacked on an edit that said--"Just Kidding". I typically get one or two points per dumb remark/story, but this one got me a whopping -29 points! Yikes. The funny thing is, I have no problem with Germans. It just seemed more funny when I typed it than it did the next day.

The point is... It was an insensitive joke and it cost me some karma (both here on reddit and probably a little bit in real life). Lesson learned.

But I am of the opinion that **concerneddad1965** has done all he can do at this point... Now he is now on the recieving and of ridicuolous accusations from his wife, his kid is not being helped and the Dog is still in danger of abuse.

Call me crazy, but at this point, I think the authorities need to be involved. Clearly, keeping things quiet to preserve the kid's dignity has back-fired. The authorities need to be called in and official records need to begin.

If left untreated, this teenager could very well progress down this sick pathway and end up being a problem for society and not just this family. Knowing what he knows, **concerneddad1965** might be obligated to report his son to the police and force him to get help.

The Wife needs to be overruled, the kid needs therapy and the dogs needs protection... Unfortunatly, the only person who can really ensure all of these things happen is **concerneddad1965** </TEXT>

<TEXT> **STORY 1:** I was walking through the SEARS in North Hollywood, CA and I was strolling down the bathroom/plumbing supply isle looking for a gasket for my toilet. I wasn't watching where I was going and I slammed (pretty hard) into a pleasent looking old man. It was Ernest Borgnine. I recognized him , and he saw that I knew who he was and smiled. I was kind of high at the time, and all I managed to say was "AIRWOLF!" Without missing a beat, he said "Yup". We shook hands and I walked away.

**STORY 2:** I used to work at the Blockbuster Video in North Hollywood, and one day, a shorter black guy wearing a colorful outfit walked in and started asking about Brigitte Nielson movies. I was the go to trivia guy at my store, so I started walking him around and pulling the Brigitte Nielson movies of the shelf and he was holding onto all of them. I said "You must really like Brigitte Nielson " and he responded (in a VERY familiar voice) "Do I like Brigitte Nielson ?" while pulling his shades down. I turned around and realized it was FLAVA FLAV. Apparently he had just wrapped The Surreal Life on VH1 where he and Brigitte had hooked up. He rented RED SONJA, ROCKY 4, COBRA and BEVERLY HILLS COP 3.

**STORY 3:** I was driving down Overland Ave. in Culver City, CA and a dumb ass driver flew accross 3 lanes of traffic to get into the left-hand turn lane and almost t-boned my car. Instead I just got side-swiped. I jumped out of my car screaming "What the fuck??" when I got a good look at the other driver. She was really pretty. When we exchanged information and went about business. Later I realized that she was AnnaLynne McCord from the new 90210 tv show. After I notified my insurance comapny that evening, I got a nasty phone call from her bitch sister (from a private number) who threatens me by saying they were going to file a lawsuit against me-- even thhough she admitted being at fault. So I posted all of her personal info in Facebook. Then I sold the story to TMZ. Later, her insurance company cut me a check for $1200... Turns out the damage she did was only superficial and could be wiped off with a rag.

**STORY 4:** I got on-stage at a GEORGE CLINTON concert in Miami Florida. He apparently liked me so much that he gave me his wedding veil (he was weraing a wedding dress) and invited me backstage to hang out in the green room. After the show I enjoyed the unique privilage of watching George Clinton smoke crack cocaine in front of me. I also scored some free sandwiches. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I woke up in the First Class cabin of an airplane headed for San Antonio.

I was a Freshman in college in Miami, FL. It was last Friday before Spring Break and I was supposed to catch a flight out of Miami International at 6am on Saturday morning.  Around 10pm I was packing when my buddies came to my room and told me we were going drinking.

We started pounding pitchers of beer around 11pm and kept drinking until 2 when the bars closed. We then proceeded to an after hours spot and drank hard liquor for the next couple of hours. Around 4:30am I realized my ride to the airport was leaving our campus at 5-- so we haul ass back to the dorm. Enroute, I vomitted all over myself and the inside of my buddy's vintage Duster.

He helps me inside, helps me change clothes and then loads me into my buddy's rental car. On the way to the airport I barfed in the rental car (but not on myself). My buddy was pissed, so he loaded me onto the bus from the rental car place to the terminal and that's the last hing I remember.

I don't remember getting to the airport, going through security or boarding my plane. I woke up 20 minutes before landing in San Antonio and I was sitting with a row to myself in the First Class cabin. As I opened my eyes I fumbled for an air-sick bag and completely filled it with blown chunks. Before I could even fold up the bag a stewdardess approached with a pitcher of water and traded me for the vomit bag. I asked her what I was doing in first class and she told me I had gotten on a flight that was an hour earlier than my scheduled flight and they bumped me to first class. I didn't even get to enjoy it because I was passed-the-fuck-out.

The worst part was, I got to San Antonio an hour early and had to sit in the airport for an hour waiting for my parents and I was still wasted. When they walked up and found me half-concious, I tried telling them I had the flu, but my dad took one look at me, laughed and said "You're hungover". Then they made me walk around the fucking Alamo all day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We need a better way to respond to mass shooters. Hitting the deck and hoping to not get shot is a poor option.

Before we were taught the simple practice of Stop, Drop and Roll... More people suffered severe burns and death from fire. Stop, Drop and Roll works.

When an anthill is attacked by an invader, the ants swarm en masse and engulf the offender. Could people do something similar to a gunman?

Once a shooting begins, there will never be time for the potential victims (who are also likely to be strangers) to coordinate an offensive. But if we had an AUTOMATIC REFLEXIVE ACTION drilled into us, could we respond without thinking and achieve a more positive outcome?? </TEXT>
