<TEXT> Actually I don't think the US was able to prove the Chelsea Manning publications cost lives during her trial. They had a long time to investigate too. 

Brigadier general Robert Carr, a senior counter-intelligence officer who headed the information review task force that investigated the impact of the Wikileaks disclosures, said they had discovered no specific examples of anyone who lost his or her life in reprisals following publication of documents on the internet.

<TEXT> FOIA actually. A lot of FOIA requests become lawsuits because of the infamous foot-dragging that occurs in the process. E.g., one funny and typical story - ["Justice department 'uses aged computer system to frustrate Foia requests'"](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/16/justice-department-freedom-of-information-computer-system)

There are a lot of examples of FOIA lawsuits emerging from these tactics. In fact, a certain public official was suspected of dodging FOIA requests when they put government correspondence on a private server, and later deleted portions of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Freedom of Information Act actually gives that right with certain exceptions. FOIA requests are in-general resisted through a wide variety of means. E.g., using extremely old hardware   software to process them, some people suspected that a US Secretary of State of storing correspondence in a private location (and later destroying them) as a way to avoid being subject to FOIA requests.

If you look online, a lot of FOIA requests result in lawsuits because of various stalling and avoidance tactics. You can find more examples here if you want: https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=foia </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, that scummy marketing was the biggest reason people were bitter about that game. I was completely out of the loop (I try my best to avoid marketing and pre-release talk) until after it came out, and I think I enjoyed it more partly because of that. However I had a friend who's impression was pretty much the same as yours, so I understand what you mean.

I wish more entertainment realistically explored the topic of societal dependence on technology, because the current real world has a lot of thrilling examples as-it-is. Would only need a little imagination to write quality plots with those tools. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doesn't have to be a conspiracy. Other journalism issues can be cause for a trust fallout. Like, in the NYT case:

[+] a Harvard study showed they were among the sites that used euphemisms to describe American torture programs during Bush

[+] Heavily pushed for the Iraq invasion based on documents a Bush government official leaked about WMDs in Iraq

[+] Was the last news outlet to admit the US bombed a DWB hospital, despite other outlets including the AP having long-said so; and followed it up with an article saying the US was *accused* of bombing a DWB hospital   later a long article explaining why it was understandable that they did.

[+] Refused to publish Mark Klein wiretapping story until after Bush's reelection

[+] Suggested Snowden gave documents to China, based off their official government sources.

[+] Published controversial articles from Snowden's documents, and then accused Snowden of leaking documents that were not in the public interest (even tho he relied on journalists to make that call about what to publish)

I don't mind giving sources later, if you want. At work atm. But people may not like NYT for reasons beyond just Alex Jones and reptilian conspiracies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don't recall, Brown is an award winning journalist, who certainly went deep with Anonymous and other online groups. Eventually that resulted in him being arrested and harassed by prosecutors for sharing a link. When the infamous Stratfor hacks were released, he shared a link to the files to get people to sift through them. Because some of the files included swiped credit card numbers, he was charged with "trafficking" in stolen credit cards. Oddly, right before trial -- realizing how insane it was to charge him over this -- the feds dropped the charges around linking, but pushed forward on other charges because he hid a laptop in a cabinet and (stupidly...) got angry at the FBI when they came to investigate. The odd part is that following a plea deal, the judge sentenced him to an astounding 63 months in jail -- and cited the sharing of the link (again, those charges were dropped, but it sometimes appeared the judge didn't realize that) to explain why.

However, I suspect if you gave the government the power to silence publishers based on what they publish - they aren't going to resist going after journalists who do actual reporting and speak truth to power (and make other journalists more hesitant to follow their example). I doubt they'll going to go after sellout journalists that serve corporate or government agendas, like say, journalists that pushed for invading Iraq because of the leaked fledgling 'evidence' of WMDs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He actually goes into greater depth. I don't have time to talk about Russia's complaints (at work) but I don't think all the blame for the situation is on any one country, and I think there are places for wiggle room if leaders were willing to consider it. There are a lot of things the US does that would totally freak out Americans (and be shouted loudly in media) if Russia did. I mean, for one on military spending and military bases around the world - US hugely outnumbers any other country. Again, I don't have time to cite sources and post a meatier comment - but just wanted to say there is more to this issue than just Russia being bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't understand what you mean, the headline said it was partial for things like research and education. You are aware that the biggest DRM proponents aren't even a fan of that? Like look how hard it is to pass legislation in the US to make it legal for security researchers to break DRM, thanks to the CFAA   DMCA. In that instance alone, there are companies that benefit from preventing researchers from uncovering issues with their software. DRM gives tremendous control the maker in many more ways than that (like forcing mechanics to repair your vehicle with only their parts) and in a world rife with corporate lobbying - this small step from Portugal is praiseworthy. </TEXT>

Read the article for the violent details and see how the guy simply took the beatings, and only said things like 'Why are you doing this?' and 'What kind of example are you making to the kids looking at you?'

One of the comments said this:

I am sure the lesson taken here by DiGiovanni and his ilk is to learn a small modicum of self-control and immediately and fatally shoot the person they decide to molest instead of enjoying a little of the old ultraviolence. They won't talk back after that. Not in court or anywhere else. </TEXT>

Sure, they can take command to defend against a sudden attack or during a war, but that isn't the same as initiating war.

<TEXT> I don't think the article was denying the security advantages. In fact, it talked about that when it described the "network effects" of this - which is the same point you are making.

It more talked about the danger of mandatory centralization of your online identity. Brazil passed a law requiring web services like blogs and forums to require additional identifying information about users, which likely wasn't intended to improve website security.

Also, since this was somewhat a speculative topic - it's possible Spotify's policy didn't work out for it because the alternative is always piracy. Convenience is the biggest killer of piracy, and perhaps making logging in more annoying wasn't helping the site. Or maybe they were too early. I remember years ago, when websites started requiring social media logins - I just stopped going there. Perhaps people will be more comfortable with it over time? </TEXT>

They're negotiated by lobbyists from the biggest players, and certainly not in the interest of a truly free market - and with the side effect that countries can be locked into them for years or indefinitely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Colin Fieman, the federal public defender assigned to Tippens (who also successfully got a similar case dropped in early March) would not tell Ars precisely what information on WikiLeaks he had wanted to introduce in court.

"Although the documents are now public, they are still classified, and I need to be circumspect about recirculating information in them," Fieman e-mailed. "However, I can tell you that some of the documents of particular interest relate to the **government's ability to alter time stamps and other metadata without leaving a forensic trail, and [its ability to] otherwise use malware that evades 'reverse engineering' by defense experts."**

It's kinda funny the ripple effects WLs has. In this case, they made public evidence that the government can frame someone for possessing CP enough to fool experts - and this federal public defender is using it to force the government into either forfeiting cases like this or try to figure how they can deal with that argument. </TEXT>

Since it was 1:30 am, Scott was cautious and answered to door with a gun in his hand, pointed at the floor. He opened the door to see only a "shadowy figure" and began stepping backwards. The shadowy figure was Deputy Richard Sylvester, who immediately shot Scott six times, killing him.

Deputy Sylvester admits he never identified himself as a law enforcement officer. He also claims Scott's movement back into his apartment was perceived by him as a Scott attempting to find cover before opening fire. Perception is all that matters, and only one person's perception really matters: Deputy Sylvester's. </TEXT>

Based on that (and other leaks that occurred under Obama), I don't think they 'benefit from the leaks' except when they believe they can spin the leaks into a narrative they want to spread; and even then - I wouldn't expect them to make solid criticism of the system itself.  </TEXT>

When lawmakers point out that the bill does more harm than good, they'll likely be derided for refusing to "compromise." Granted with the ACA and other Congressional kerfuffles currently taking priority, this bill may take some time before large ISP lobbyists and lawmakers can finally table such legislation. But those of you that care about net neutrality need to understand one thing: net neutrality's death will come disguised as a 2017 bill pretending to save it.

<TEXT> The Putin critic (an LGBT mother who fled Russia) he's sourcing said this:

Meanwhile, while Russia continues to dominate the front pages, Trump will continue waging war on immigrants, cutting funding for everything thats not the military, assembling his cabinet of deplorableswith six Democrats voting to confirm Ben Carson for Housing, for example, and ten to confirm Rick Perry for Energy. According to the Trump plan, each of these seems intent on destroying the agency he or she is chosen to runto carry out what Steve Bannon calls the deconstruction of the administrative state. As for Sessions, in his first speech as attorney general he promised to cut back civil rights enforcement and he has already abandoned a Justice Department case against a discriminatory Texas voter ID law. But it was his Russia lie that grabbed the big headlines.

It's about how important journalism is getting buried under wild allegations. People who have been shown to be disreputable now are getting treated like experts; people like Murdoch writer Louise Mensch. People who started conspiracy theories about Bill Clinton (like David Brock with the Arkansas Project) now play a leading role in the latest conspiracy theories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think he's a BLM member, but after getting fired from The Intercept for falsifying evidence   shoddy journalism - he wrote a five thousand word essay accusing The Intercept   "'New York liberal media'" as being racist.

The River front times did a lot of investigation into the guy, and holy cow is he something. For example:

More recently, Thompson launched a GoFundMe campaign, claiming he was running for St. Louis mayor. (He never filed the necessary paperwork.)

"This election is all about people power," he wrote. "Because only with your voices and your votes and your power can we fight back against Trumpian fascism and socio-economic terrorism." He raised just $25 of his $5,000 goal.

When the NSA thing went down, people were sharing all kinds of information like Microsoft's "NSAKey" and the Office of Information Awareness (started by none other by Admiral Poindexter, man who helped a President route around the Constitution before in the Contra Scandal - and lying to Congress about it). 

Nowadays reddit is a battleground of propaganda and astroturfing.  </TEXT>

Plus, didn't Trump propose a military budget increase that itself is 80% of the entire Russian military budget? The US has the largest military presence around the world. If we have a dispute with a rival, it should be resolved diplomatically - not by dragging us down into nuclear tensions. We've gone this route before and saw the mess it got us in, why repeat history? </TEXT>

So we'll make an effort to make it look natural.

<TEXT> The article says some interesting things about National Security Advisor HR McMaster   Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis.

McMaster:

McMaster has been a vocal proponent of protecting civilians in warzones and avoiding the clash of civilizations approach favored by Trump and his top advisers.

In a speech at the Carnegie Council in 2014, McMaster said that the United States must partner with people in Muslim-majority countries to defeat groups like Islamic State, describing them as the people who are suffering the most from terrorism. McMaster added that to win such conflicts,U.S. forces must understand the history and social dynamics of the countries it is fighting in, as well as have empathy for the people among whom these wars are fought.

McMaster has also criticized agenda-driven D.C. think tanks and foreign policy seemingly driven by the weapons industry. In a 2015 speech at the University of South Florida, McMaster said that the military-industrial complex may represent a greater threat to us than at any time in history.

Mattis

As the commander of the 1st Marine Division in Iraq, Mattis believed that treating Iraqis with respect was essential to American security. He investigated abuses of prisoners in Iraq and helped stop the use of torture at one prison where an Iraqi in U.S. detention had died after being beaten.

On the campaign trail, Trump advocated for the return of waterboarding. A short meeting with Mattis during the transition period in November had Trump reconsidering his stance. The president-elect told reporters that he asked Mattis about waterboarding, and Mattis replied that he never found it to be useful. Instead, Mattis told Trump: Ive always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture. Trump told reporters in January that he would defer to Mattis on the issue from now on. </TEXT>

The law will force internet providers to record every internet customer's top-level web history in real-time for up to a year, which can be accessed by numerous government departments; force companies to decrypt data on demand -- though the government has never been that clear on exactly how it forces foreign firms to do that that; and even disclose any new security features in products before they launch. 

Not only that, the law also gives the intelligence agencies the power to hack into computers and devices of citizens (known as equipment interference), although some protected professions -- such as journalists and medical staff -- are layered with marginally better protections.

[Source](https://theintercept.com/2017/02/13/naacp-trump-netneutrality/)

The "closing the digital divide" is literally one of Pai's talking points that is totally incongruous with what he did immediately upon entering office. In addition, Pai's stance on net neutrality is very very well known:

"On the day that the Title II [net neutrality] Order was adopted, I said that 'I dont know whether this plan will be vacated by a court, reversed by Congress, or overturned by a future Commission. But I do believe that its days are numbered,' [Source](https://www.techdirt.com/blog/netneutrality/articles/20161209/05240636229/fcc-commissioner-pai-says-net-neutralitys-days-are-numbered-under-trump.shtml)

And the rest of the Intercept article shows how these various civil rights groups have opposed net neutrality in the past. E.g., 

The NAACP, which signed letters opposing net neutrality both times the rule was proposed by the Obama administration, has named AT T, Verizon, and Comcast as corporate fundraising partners. After the NAACP endorsed Comcasts merger with NBC, Comcast disclosed that the NAACP was one of the the recipients of $1.8 billion in funds doled out to various community groups.

This is literally what you're defending. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly: 

But Kim Keenan, the president of MMTC, **the group that organized the joint letter, has showered Pai with praise. He is really focused on closing the digital divide.** As an advocate, I feel so much pride that that it is a priority for his chairmanship, Keenan told Multichannel News, a trade outlet.

That should immediately be a red flag if you have been following the developments at the FCC. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is NOT a friend to net neutrality.

Secondly,

They are criticizing the executive branch's tool for accomplishing net neutrality, asking for Congress to "lock in net neutrality." The danger is that Congress is largely controlled by politicians who do not like net neutrality, and may write a bill that sounds like they are saving net neutrality - even though they are actually killing it.

Instead of classifying broadband as a public utility, the letter states, open internet rules should be written by statute. What does that mean? It means the Republican-led Congress should take control of the process  the precise approach that is favored by industry.

None of the civil rights groups that signed the joint letter responded to a request for comment.

While advocating against net neutrality, the organizations on the joint letter have raked in money from the telecom industry. </TEXT>

Targeted bombing is **normally safer** for civilians than indiscriminate bombing. In fact, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said during his confirmation hearing that the U.S. should provide Saudi Arabia with better targeting intelligence and better targeting capability in order to minimize collateral damage.

But the Obama administration, despite its reluctance to offend the Saudis, halted the guidance-systems sales after concluding that the Saudi-led coalition was **targeting civilians deliberately.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Vice President of Comcast](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) has personally pushed agendas with both major party establishments.

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And despite **hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer,** Cohen has **spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress**, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate.

That's just one example, but for some reason people put a lot of faith in what presidential campaigners *say* as opposed to what they *do* and this is an example of the trap we fall into.

We need **better journalism** so more voters are informed on who actually represents their interests, and a heck of a lot more **reform so we don't keep picking the lesser of evils for an office that we all pray doesn't abuse the tremendous power afforded to it.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> What ranking? Freedom House? Freedom of the Press indices ranks the US pretty close to Canada (and way higher than the UK for obvious reason).

"The Human Freedom Index" seems sketch considering they consider the UK the free-est country (ignoring the whole censorship and domestic surveillance thing).

Edit: also what do you think about this:

comedian Mike Ward has been told to pay $42,000 for making an offensive joke about a singer named Jeremy Gabriel. Ward is planning to appeal, but the fact that he's been found guilty of a "human rights" violation seems ridiculous enough. To be clear, the joke was not a particularly nice joke, but still: 

https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160731/17384835121/canadian-comedian-plans-to-appeal-42k-joke-that-insulted-someone.shtml

I don't really know a relevant case of abuse of power in Canada, but Bill of Rights protections are pretty much the only thing protecting Americans -or at least slowing the process undoing those protections. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never heard the Santa Claus thing (I get my news from TechDirt and TheIntercept, and that's it) but regulation on journalistic integrity can be dangerous. There are numerous occasions where msm messes up on the truth (WMDs in Iraq, claiming reading WL's emails is illegal, claimed Snowden gave documents to China - then Russia, claimed US didn't accidentally bomb a hospital), and if regulatory capture occurred - it would only result in their rivals being put down.

People just need to learn the hard way that there is a lot of falsehoods on the internet. I imagine they can fall for only so many nigerian price scams before they realize that. </TEXT>

Edit: Bruce Schneier said this recently:

Right now, we have a defeated majority. Many are scared, and many are motivated -- and few of those are applying their motivation constructively. We need to harness that fear and energy to start fixing our society now, instead of waiting four or even eight years, at which point the problems would be worse and the solutions more extreme. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Vice President of Comcast](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) has personally pushed agendas with both major party establishments.

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And despite **hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer,** Cohen has **spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress**, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate.

That's just one example, but for some reason people put a lot of faith in what presidential campaigners *say* as opposed to what they *do* and this is an example of the trap we fall into.

Neither major party candidate cared about us; one of them entirely expected everyone to vote for an extremely unpopular candidate (one who lost to Donald Trump of all people) after blocking an obviously popular candidate. We need **better journalism** so more voters are informed on who actually represents their interests, and a heck of a lot more **reform so we don't keep picking the lesser of evils for an office that we all pray doesn't abuse the tremendous power afforded to it.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> They wrote a report giving their reasons. Here's one of their points:

Some oppose leniency for Snowden because he violated the law. But many in the national security establishment who committed serious crimes have received little or no punishment. President Obamas decision to look forward, not backward absolved from liability the officials who designed and implemented the torture and extraordinary rendition programs at the CIA and Defense Department during the George W. Bush Administration. It also meant that those who destroyed evidence of these crimes and misled Congress about illegal torture and surveillance would never face charges.

In addition, the government has also been lenient to high-level officials who made illegal disclosures or destroyed classified information. Examples are cases involving National Security Advisor Sandy Berger and CIA Directors David Petraeus and John Deutch.

There are, of course, differences between these cases and Snowdens. But the crucial point is that only in Snowdens case was the motivation behind his illegal activity to benefit America. The three others involved efforts to gain glory or avoid criticism, or simple convenience and simple disregard for the law that put our security at risk. Yet the perpetrators were treated leniently. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Money in politics is a big part of the problem.

[Vice President of Comcast](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) personally pushed agendas with both major party establishments.

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And despite **hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer,** Cohen has **spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress**, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate.

Until this gets addressed somehow (like perhaps more journalism pointing out financial backers), we're going to keep falling into similar situations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're to blame for a lot of problems right now for their failure to inform the public on issues that affect democracy like money in politics, mass surveillance, and transparency. When they're not ignoring an important issue, they're pushing propaganda. 

Remember when one provided justification for invading Iraq (based on faulty intelligence)? When almost all of them accused Snowden of giving documents to China, being a Russian spy, being a narcissist (and ignored all the publications about mass surveillance after PRISM)? Pretty recently, one of them accused Snowden for disclosing programs not in the public interest - that they themselves published (and after Snowden obviously relied on them to publish only programs in the public interest).

Remember the Harvard study that revealed many US media outlets had referred to US brutal torture programs with euphemisms - but not foreign? Or when publishing Mark Klein's revelation of NSA - AT T eavesdropping was explicitly postponed until after a Presidential election? Refused to admit that the US bombed a hospital even after other outlets had, and days later begrudgingly wrote a long piece that admitted it but provided reasons why it was reasonable.

The list goes on   on   on. Heck, the NYT [still has an article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/world/asia/china-said-to-have-made-call-to-let-leaker-depart.html) where they effectively accused Snowden as giving state secrets to China. I could cite all of these examples, but they do it so perpetually that I'd still be leaving out many more examples. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Vice President of Comcast](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) is personally pushing agendas with both major party establishments.

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And despite **hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer,** Cohen has **spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress**, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate.

That's just one example, but for some reason people put a lot of faith in what presidential campaigners *say* as opposed to what they *do* and this is an example of the trap you'll fall into.

Neither major party candidate cared about you; one of them entirely expected you to vote for an extremely unpopular candidate (one who lost to Donald Trump of all people) after blocking an obviously popular candidate. By rewarding that, you're ensuring that such a practice never ceases to end. </TEXT>

They are so firmly ingrained with 'the establishment' that, at most, I expect future candidates that will be better at convincing voters that they are anti-establishment.

Even while mainstream media is cringingly whitewashing President Obama's presidency, I'm pretty sure historians not see him as any better than his predecessor, and possibly worse for codifying certain domestic and foreign policies and tightening secrecy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If that's been a problem for you before, I again highly reccomend The Intercept because they seriously do their research and provide primary source documents. I have the most confidence in them for investigative journalism.
The downside is that they publish articles less frequently than most.

I should add that certain sources are better for certain topics than others. A sign of a good journalist is one that has become a specialist in a topic and can tie current events into past events that the average person likely doesn't know about or forgot. E.g., I like Jim Sterling for games journalism because he frequently cites relevant past anticonsumer practices I may have forgotten or not known.

Also bias is inevitable. It isn't always a bad thing, like being biased against anti-consumer practices. As you become more informed on a topic (whether it's mass surveillance, us deep politics, etc) - you'll start to form your own views and question sources that you usually trust. 

That all said, I sources would recommend include:

1) TechDirt - tech/legal blog that talks about police militarization, anti consumer practices, surveillance, security. For deep politics, I think The Intercept is a better source.

2) Democracy Now! - a liberal news site that talks about issues that- and gives voices to people who- mainstream media largely ignores.

3) Dan Carlin's Common Sense Podcast - a guy who runs a very popular history podcast also has a long running political one. He offers thoughtful exploration on issues that tend to get ignored, ripe with interesting historical allusions (e.g., I learned Admiral Poindexter from the Iran Contra scandal   someone who lied to Congress under oath started the [first known mass surveillance program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office) after entering the private sector). He isn't really left or right, but more pro-constitution   anti-establishment. A lot of complaints heard in this election were things he's talked about for years. He takes a lot of time for each podcast episode, so they come out slowly.

4) Cory Doctorow is a really good source for topics like DRM and related security   consumer issues

5) Jupiter Broadcasting Unfilter podcast often does really good research (existing news articles) on current technology/political events, but one of the cohosts does cringingly spout vague uninformed conspiracy theories. The other guy cross references the articles while expressing reasonable skepticism on what mainstem media reports (also drawing from his technology background)

6) Bruce Schneier is a respected authority in the security field who is also against mass surveillance programs and the like. Offers interesting commentary on different security issues, but more optimistic about establishment politics imo.

7) Speakers at the Chaos Communications Congress can be very interesting and passionate. Jacob Appelbaum (originally from the Tor project   Wikileaks) has some of the best explanations for complicated technical surveillance programs that anyone can understand.

Hopefully this helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a [subreddit post](https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/) that aggregates articles on astroturfing.

Additionally, there was a recent study on creating an algorithm that can [detect astroturfing.](https://www.utsa.edu/today/2016/10/astroturfing.html) It's not a novel approach but interesting none-the-less. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, it definitely did in a relative sense. Way more people were interested in the issue than ever before, e.g. the stories were constantly hitting the reddit front-page before mods started cracking down (leading to the eventual removal of this sub's mods). It's always going to be the case that the reformers are in the minority, especially when the fourth estate that is supposed to inform the public continuously does the opposite. Most of us saw msm's near complete disregard for the huge revelations, in contrast to the heroic journalism occurring at the same time.

In short, although I agree that there is a cultural aspect, I think most people are literally just uninformed; today information like this has to get through some pretty heavy filters before they reach most people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can really feel the energy in this article. Blood pumping words on a huge issue that most of us already know (especially reading recent articles) is rapidly getting whack. 

This year we've been hearing about incredibly ambitious FBI activities (much more than just encryption story), a Court saying NSA collected data is admissible evidence, local police departments abusing their data access, profitable surveillance businesses, rolling out facial recognition in security cameras, Microsoft selling software that can read emotions from individuals in a crowd, Microsoft selling software for police surveillance (see Domain Awareness System, NYC), global legislation   rulings that expand surveillance...

Not even to mention the usual improvements on privacy invasion from the private sector in 2016, e.g., Google's recent policy change, Microsoft Windows 10 data collection, WhatsApp, Facebook announcing tracking nonFacebook users..etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually trust the security team responsible for putting it out there. They've also been pressuring other companies like Symantec. This is their official reason for the 7 day notice:

Our standing recommendation is that companies should fix critical vulnerabilities within 60 days -- or, if a fix is not possible, they should notify the public about the risk and offer workarounds. We encourage researchers to publish their findings if reported issues will take longer to patch. Based on our experience, however, we believe that more urgent action -- within 7 days -- is appropriate for critical vulnerabilities under active exploitation. The reason for this special designation is that each day an actively exploited vulnerability remains undisclosed to the public and unpatched, more computers will be compromised.

Seven days is an aggressive timeline and may be too short for some vendors to update their products, but it **should be enough time to publish advice about possible mitigations, such as temporarily disabling a service, restricting access, or contacting the vendor for more information.** As a result, after 7 days have elapsed without a patch or advisory, we will support researchers making details available **so that users can take steps to protect themselves.** By holding ourselves to the same standard, we hope to improve both the state of web security and the coordination of vulnerability management.

Plus, wasn't it revealed in 2013 that Microsoft was sharing 0-days with the NSA? Wouldn't this be defeating that practice?

<TEXT> Allegedly the original Skype team was exploring the interception capability as early as 2008 in a program called 'Project Chess.' They integrated their program with PRISM in 2010. They had the interception capability in their product before Microsoft even bought them. Microsoft then went on to patent it in 2011. However I remember Microsoft changed Skype even further for those purposes, which was controversial in the security community. I also heard China was intercepting Skype calls from older C3 talks (see the Tor talks on Youtube from around this time period), which cited scary stories of Chinese contacts. If so, Skype may have directly or indirectly harmed people living in autocratic regimes who rely on private communications.

There's actually an article that lists the timeline of events.

<TEXT> What about issues that crop up only when you cannot refund it? And what if we become reliant on a good refund system that can be taken away, weakened or not extended to in-app purchases.

Journalism in-general is pretty bad right now, but those few who have proven their integrity (which isn't so much about neutrality but honesty, information depth, and sometimes risk) play a really important role. Good journalism can be an incredibly positive force. E.g., those who become specialists on a topic can frequently point out past events (either forgotten or not known to audience members) that illustrates a point or raises awareness about a reality (e.g., shady business practices, societal problems, etc).

I empathize with anyone who hates the utter debauchery going on, but I think we'll need good journalists (including game journalists, ie not corporate mouthpieces) even with the promise of refunds. Did I understand your point? What do you think? </TEXT>

I'm sure a lot of us have become more aware of concerns of reliance on corporate controlled mediums for information exchange. Ranging from Comcast   AT T to Google/YouTube and Facebook. In-fact, Facebook has bragged in the past of their capability to give greater visibility to certain information   affect behavior (e.g., voting   mood study).

Hemisphere isnt a partnership but rather a product AT T developed, marketed, and sold at a cost of millions of dollars per year to taxpayers. No warrant is required to make use of the companys massive trove of data, according to AT T documents, only a promise from law enforcement to not disclose Hemisphere if an investigation using it becomes public.

Considering AT T's well known history (including exclusive involvement in FAIRVIEW which collected much more than metadata), it isn't surprising to hear these allegations.  </TEXT>

"Once AT T provides a lead through Hemisphere, then investigators use routine police work, like getting a court order for a wiretap or following a suspect around, to provide the same evidence for the purpose of prosecution. This is known as parallel construction."

This document here is striking, Schwartz told The Daily Beast. Ive seen documents produced by the government regarding Hemisphere, but this is the **first time Ive seen an AT T document which requires parallel construction in a service to government.** Its very troubling and not the way law enforcement should work in this country." </TEXT>

Here are a couple other (definitely not all) highlights:

According to one source, DarkMatters newfound interest in offensive operations coincided with revelations contained in leaked emails that the Italian company Hacking Team had sold surveillance equipment to a large number of repressive regimes. Out of Hacking Teams ashes, DarkMatter rose

But what two sources and several security researchers The Intercept consulted were most concerned about was DarkMatters plan to become a certificate authority.

This was funny, remember that Hacking Team had their emails dumped on reddit:

**After the Hacking Team emails leaked in July, there were loud, angry meetings in CyberPoint offices  people deciding what to do now that their internal operations in the Middle East had been exposed to the world.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Mainstream media* misleads the public much more than it gives useful information.

Remember when one provided justification for invading Iraq (based on faulty intelligence)? When almost all of them accused Snowden of giving documents to China, being a Russian spy, being a narcissist (and ignored all the publications about mass surveillance after PRISM)? Pretty recently, one of them accused Snowden for disclosing programs not in the public interest - that they themselves published (and after Snowden obviously relied on them to publish only programs in the public interest).

Remember the Harvard study that revealed many US media outlets had referred to US brutal torture programs with euphemisms - but not foreign? Or when publishing Mark Klein's revelation of NSA - AT T eavesdropping was explicitly postponed until after a Presidential election? Refused to admit that the US bombed a hospital even after other outlets had, and days later begrudgingly wrote a long piece that admitted it but provided reasons why it was reasonable.

The list goes on   on   on. If you want, I can sit down and cite all of these examples with good sources (and maybe add more to the list as they come to mind). They do it perpetually.

<TEXT> Well, escalating military conflict with a superpower is something to be taken carefully - which I'm not sure is happening. Cold War like scenarios are great for certain industries and tends to be really bad for activism, dissent, and free thought (which might be really bad if you think the US already has growing unaddressed domestic problems).

There's also bound to be an uptick in propaganda   misinformation, which will probably ruin open or informed discussion.

Wouldn't it be awesome though if it did just mean more transparency   accountability? </TEXT>

<TEXT> every establishment politician

Not all are for it. Keep track of votes, there are some who vote against these expansions - but they are in the minority. And Presidential candidates are usually much more vetted by the early political process to ensure we rarely see those types of candidates. So you're right, we cannot rely on voting alone and expect much to happen.

But don't lose hope! There are always people resisting these trends, and doing little things can be cathartic in its own right. Simply opposing them on any level makes me feel better. Whether it's donating to the EFF (which are doing a fundraiser right now) or ACLU, staying up-to-date so I always have information at my fingertips, talking about the issues, or making surveillance harder with privacy or anonymity tools and/or habits, I'm resisting these trends.

Losing hope is the worst because that's exactly what elites stand to gain from; people going silent (from fear, disinterest, disappointment, etc). </TEXT>

It's ruining reddit as the discussions with people who had some spare time to talk about things they care about are being overrun by political   corporate agendas that have much more time to fill the discussion spaces and stymie open discussion.

What's scarier is how much we will not even know about. Those things combined with the possibilities of astroturfing, silencing dissent and manufacturing popularity, is unsettling.

<TEXT> I see more people informed about establishment politics than ever before. The reality is that we'll always be in the minority, especially when factoring in astroturfing. Just look at the Snowden revelations, a huge story about an actual science-fiction reality - but most people do not know anything about the story, let alone the program details and the time mainstream media spent to focusing public attention on the source (ignoring everything after PRISM)   discrediting him (the [NYT even claimed he gave documents to China](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/world/asia/china-said-to-have-made-call-to-let-leaker-depart.html?_r=1)).

However, I think it's empowering to see that with each of these events - more people are becoming aware   having their previously held world views shattered.  </TEXT>

Clinton also told a housing trade group in 2013 that on certain issues, she has a public and a private position. If everybodys watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least, said Clinton. **So, you need both a public and a private position.**

<TEXT> I don't think that's the solution Schneier would ever advocate.

A big issue with that is such an expansion of powers can also cause new levels of damage to be done by secret government tools. If their tools break functionality, what kind of transparency is in place that let the public know?

The new plan to drastically expand the governments hacking and surveillance authorities is known formally as amendments to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the proposal would allow the government to hack a million computers or more with a single warrant. If Congress doesnt pass legislation blocking this proposal, the new rules go into effect on December 1.

But the Justice Department has given the public far too little information about its hacking tools and how it plans to use them. And the amendments to Rule 41 are woefully short on protections for the security of hospitals, life-saving computer systems, or the phones and electronic devices of innocent Americans.

Without rigorous and periodic evaluation of hacking software by independent experts, it would be nothing short of reckless to allow this massive expansion of government hacking.

If malware crashes your personal computer or phone, it can mean a loss of photos, documents and recordsa major inconvenience. But if a hospitals computer system or other critical infrastructure crashes, it puts lives at risk. Surgical directives are lost. Medical histories are inaccessible. Patients can wait hours for care. If critical information isnt available to doctors, people could die. Without new safeguards on the governments hacking authority, the FBI could very well be responsible for this kind of tragedy in the future.

The article continues to mention examples of government hacking tools being used against them and ways things can go wrong such as:

Indeed, damage happens even when changes are straightforward: recently an anti-virus scan shut down a device in the middle of heart surgery.

<TEXT> I'm not sure I'd put it past Microsoft either though. 

[Recent story mentions Microsoft's cooperation with NYC in regards to surveillance.](https://theintercept.com/2016/09/24/a-walking-tour-of-new-yorks-massive-surveillance-network/)

The building is home to the citys Domain Awareness System, which collects and analyzes information from police cameras, radars, license plate readers and more. The Domain Awareness System was built in partnership with Microsoft, which is selling the software to other cities, with New York getting a cut of the profits.

The fact they patented the ability to intercept Skype calls and also sell software to [analyze facial expressions of crowds for political purposes in realtime](https://theintercept.com/2016/08/04/microsoft-pitches-technology-that-can-read-facial-expressions-at-political-rallies/) doesn't strengthen my trust either.

I also remember an Oracle executive defended the surveillance described in the Snowden documents. So I get the feeling most big tech companies are suspect of government ties, but it is interesting reading that many have resisted certain types of government requests. There's definitely complexity to corporate-government relations that we don't fully know about yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> WikiLeaks plans to release documents pertaining to Google and the US electoral system over the next 10 weeks, the organization announced today. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange announced the planned release schedule in a video address at the end of a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday morning, where the organization was celebrating its 10th anniversary.

The upcoming releases would follow WikiLeaks' publication in July of more than 19,000 emails from seven top officials in the Democratic National Convention (DNC). The emails, which included full names, phone numbers, and addresses, suggested that the DNC favored Clinton over her primary rival, Bernie Sanders, and led to the resignation of chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

Asked whether the upcoming releases would "destroy" Clinton, Assange appeared to downplay expectations. "Are upcoming publications significant in relation to the US election? Yeah, we think they're significant," he said. "Do they show interesting features of US power factions and how they operate? Yes, they do."

Assange also denied accusations that he and his organization are specifically targeting Clinton and the Democratic Party. "I certainly feel sorry for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump," he said. "These are two people who are tormented by their ambitions, in different ways."

On the last point, I'm pretty sure he likened the two major party candidates as choosing between "cholera or gonorrhea." Also, can anyone imagine if Assange decided to do this:

Assange originally planned to announce today's release **from the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London,** where he has been living in asylum since 2012. But WikiLeaks canceled his appearance this week, citing "security concerns." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The extremes of the blame the victim paradigm seems a bit odd. I remember when the Intercept interviewed an NSA hacker who talked in a similar way (which isn't unusual) and blamed people for not using Tor for having no privacy. I use Tor, but I know it doesn't afford perfect anonymity - and if I became a victim, surely someone could point out that if I ever enable javascript on a website - I deserved to be a victim.

I think there are so many ways to make a mistake nowadays that there will always be something you can blame victims for not doing. I wonder if we'll eventually blame whistleblowers for getting killed when they don't have their own personal "encrypted insurance" like Wikileaks does. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Their claim is that they were concerned that the company would either ignore the claim (based on what they said of evidence of noteworthy lazy   poor security that persisted for years, and the MedSec CEO also [claims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=curdJoTysF8) that St Jude's has a history for ignoring vulnerability disclosures) or sue MedSec (I'd think for breaking DRM) - which might silence them and keep the information underwraps. Unfortunately, internet of things products are infamous for not investing into security - I think even Dick Cheny may have had his pacemaker's wifi disabled as a safe measure.

By putting financial pressure on the large company while releasing the report, St Jude will have a stronger incentive to address what MedSec considered as serious vulnerabilities   protect many patients who depend on those products. 

**That is their claim anyways.** I might look into the CEO's claim of historical negligence as she provided the years they may have ignored security disclosures. If they are correct, it sounds like they did the right thing. Bruce Schneier has long complained that there are insufficient profit motives for good security in the system as it is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard that the usual failngs of revolving doors can happen at hospitals too. I heard from someone working in a hospital about an individual responsible for supplies, set the hospital up in an very long unpopular contract with a large medical device company - that included replacing all their devices with that particular brand (which made doctors very angry). What made the story shady, and the source nervous to tell me, was that the person later was hired by that company. I think the source said the reason they even knew that was circumstantial, so what's scary is we likely will not know of these dealings.

Since I'm just a pseudonymous redditor who is relating a story from others, take it with a grain of salt. But the revolving door aspect is not a new phenomenon, and I think a ton of people are forced to be dependent on devices that are insecure and 'protected' only by obscurity. </TEXT>

Distorting   surpressing information through astroturfing has gotten so big that people normally detached from that type of drama have recently acknowledged it like [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/09/internet_disinf.html), [Dan Carlin](http://www.dancarlin.com/common-sense-home-landing-page/) (latest podcast), and [Glenn Greenwald](https://theintercept.com/2016/09/06/the-unrelenting-pundit-led-effort-to-delegitimize-all-negative-reporting-about-hillary-clinton/).

I know the intercept's main point was that the stories the WaPo criticized as not important or in the public interest, were mostly ones they had published themselves - one of which they won a Pulitzer for. The hypocrisy is that Snowden openly relied on journalists to filter what is in the public interest (not decide for himself), and the WaPo (one of the receivers of leaked documents) published stories that they criticize Snowden for.

<TEXT> I think the Hillay saga has been, for many, their first introduction to real American politik. As someone who has seen both major US parties as elitists not working in the public interest for years, it's been amazing seeing people seeing through the usual political games   openly talking about it. I think many people who have been outraged by Hillary will see other problems in the institutions, like corporate   foreign influence in US poltics and lacking transparency   accountability etc.

Of course most will not stay informed and before we know it, things will calm down   it will seem like few care at all, but we both know that is normal. People make snide comments about reddit but I think it's historically been a great platform for raising awareness of issues that entrenched interests have no desire to address or honestly discuss. Astroturfing may change that though.

Tl;Dr, don't be surprised people are uninformed on important issues but be excited for when more people start to care about them   inform themselves (I think many have thanks to this rare   unusual election) </TEXT>

I think the Espionage Act was only chosen to make it so he'll only be tried in a secret military court where he will not be allowed to make a whistleblower defense.

Also, I do not think all the documents are public because recently the Intercept used undisclosed documents to verify a recent NSA leak.

Here's just a couple points to hint at what the report entailed (read the article for more complete version with sources):

[1] James Clapper himself admits that Snowden did not download all 1.5 million files he had access to, a number cited frequently in their report.

[2] They cite mass downloading (this is where the 1.5 million files number comes from) as happening before Clapper lied to Congress, but Snowden maintains that the "mass downloading" was what he did as part of his job working under Heartbleed.

[3] The report cherry picks a statement from a Russian politician as admittance of giving secrets to Russia, leaving out the "speculation" portion

[4] To quote the article's response to Snowden not being a whistleblower:

First of all, hiding behind the very technical, narrow legal definition of whistleblower is pretty ridiculous compared to the actual definition that most people use. Snowden revealed a program that involved mass surveillance on nearly all Americans, a program that the intelligence community had directly and officially denied existed. It was, in fact, a program that, from a plain reading of the law, should not exist, and the only way in which it did and could exist was if the government reinterpreted the law, in secret, to mean something completely different. That's pretty clearly whistleblowing. And the fact that the public has spoken out in support of him so much suggests that many people believe this as well.

And that doesn't even mention the fact that after this Congress changed the law to further clarify what the NSA could actually do. In other words, Congress seems to agree that what Snowden did was in the public interest. Even former Attorney General Eric Holder has admitted as much.

And, of course, the claims about "the proper channels" is ridiculous as well. We've written many, many times on what happens to individuals who go through the "proper channels." It often ends with them being put in jail on trumped up charges. Oh, and Snowden, as a contractor rather than gov't employee, had no whistleblower protections under the law anyway. Going through the "proper channels" gets you marked as a troublemaker, and that often leads to more scrutiny and questionable raids... and jail time. And, as if to confirm all this, the guy that Snowden could have reached out to as the "proper channel" had already mocked Snowden and attacked him, so it's not as if that would have been a useful route.

<TEXT> Are you literally just searching "Snowden" on this subreddit? How do you have the time to sit for hours doing this? 

Your list misses the overwhelming programs that were in the public interest to people of a all backgrounds in the US. They weakened critical security infrastructure through tactics like bribes (with the RSA) and engage in numerous mass surveillance programs (which not only scoops up information on millions of Americans but shares them with little filtering with countries like Israel) that have been so heavily reported on, that comments on downvoted reddit posts isn't going to stimulate high-level discussion that you might be looking for (at best). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't have time to give a full critique of your criticisms, but your first point is an ironic one. They actually addressed this. They said that work disputes are not rare or unusual:

I mean, people have email disputes with co-workers all the time. Is that really a sign that you're not a whistleblower, or that you're just "disgruntled?" If that's really the "dirt" that they dug up on Snowden after two years of research, they really must have nothing that actually sticks.

Right after this, they address the implication that this work dispute led to mass downloads.

HEARTBEAT, which seems to be the source of their 1.5m number, was explicited authorized by two levels of my management. I built it.
  Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 15, 2016

In other words, yes, he touched 1.5 million documents. Because he was told to as a part of his job. It's been more than two years since **James Clapper himself admitted that Snowden didn't actually take all of those.**

The fact you skipped over most of the article either is to capitalize on people who do not read the source, or a demonstration of it. I do not understand how you could otherwise miss this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see what you're saying. The original purpose was to prevent dictators (or the like) from unfairly taking from foreign companies. I think the report supports the notion that it is being abused in an unjust manner. Even US officials became concerned about the first ISDS claim that involved the US: 

Apparently, the US gov't (which had supported ISDS strongly) freaked completely the fuck out:

    Soon, top officials in the Justice Department, State Department, and Office of the US Trade Representative were on red alert.

    In meetings, government officials scribbled notes that reveal how rude an awakening the Loewen claim was:

    No one thought about this when NAFTA implementing law passed.

I'm afraid that with the mood and power structures as they are, adding new amendments will go badly. I've talked to one person who said that defending the Bill of Rights is a radical stance, another said that human rights is spoiling children (I kid you not). Civil liberties and checks and balances do not seem to be very important to many people (though I cannot quantify how many people).

<TEXT> One thing that was really underscored by the Snowden material is how close telcos have historically worked with intelligence - dating really far back. That relationship is not expected to change. I apologize this sounds vague but I'm summarizing a lot of information that fits into this larger conclusion (and don't have time to find  sources). Silicon Valley companies might have historic government relationships - but I don't think to the extent telcos have.

In that case it seems the mere threat of an ISDS case caused the government to back down in fear.

Since mentioning the TPP attracts defenders of the ISDS, I recommend checking [this summary of a pretty big recent report.](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160828/23312735376/trade-deals-corporate-sovereignty-how-convicted-executives-escape-punishment.shtml)

Here's merely one example:

In El Salvador, a court found that a factory had poisoned a village  including dozens of children  with lead, failing for years to take government-ordered steps to prevent the toxic metal from seeping out. But the factory owners lawyers used ISDS to help the company dodge a criminal conviction and the responsibility for cleaning up the area and providing needed medical care.

There's a reason a line was carefully drawn between the military and domestics by the US founding fathers, who both lived through the abuses of power   looked into a past where the military often held a political role. I don't see this escalation getting any better for democracy.

Additionally, I highly doubt that all options were actually exercised - especially considering how well armed police are today. E.g., LRADs   tear gas are already used against protesters, why resort to blowing up a suspect?

However, I still continue to see people IRL and online who are concerned and seem to only need more information to bring them to a threshold where they are willing to take action (e.g., using FDroid for FOSS android apps, or any small act of resisting the trend).

Following that observation, I fear astroturfing and other forms of commercial filters on information exchange are the biggest obstacle to greater education on the issue.  </TEXT>

[This thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=irwpnkzm sh=115ca8a6) lists a long list of sources talking about the issue, from sites such as the Guardian.

Even tho the redditor you're talking to claims he's/she's in PR, it's pretty silly to instantly refute all the evidence we've seen of it based on that isn't?

<TEXT> Quick question, were you arguing that Facebook's program would counter the kind of state censorship in India the article talked about? That is what I was arguing against. That one gatekeeper would be no better than another, possibly worse - in the case Facebook might offer it globally.

Additionally, I don't think we're giving enough credit that there can be better solutions to a problem than this - that do not create bigger monsters to deal with. If the only way to better humanity is through undemocratic policies, if there are no alternatives, then humanity has a catastrophic problem on its hands. When tyranny is the only hope for improvement, things can only get worse.

<TEXT> Facebook would have the choice of blocking access to websites they want as part of the limited service. If they were really not self-interested (and if there is even such a thing as a 'free lunch') they'd donate to public libraries to increase information access; not make themselves the gatekeepers to easy access information.

The long term danger to giving those policies any ground outweighs short term gains. If it is true that India's establishment forces opposed Facebook for their own self-interests, I'm glad to hear because in some places - corporations and governments often have the same interests. </TEXT>

But your other points are definitely true, though I think Tor can be trusted in more ways than their alternatives. E.g., larger pool of users which increases anonymity.

<TEXT> Depending on what country you operate in, it can be pretty scary. Countless examples. And hopefully you're not entering for the money, because part of the reason there is so much bad journalism is that honest journalism isn't lucrative (speaking as an outsider, not a journalist myself). [This article](https://theintercept.com/2016/07/22/oil-lobby-paid-washington-post-and-atlantic-to-host-climate-change-deniers-at-rnc/) talks about it a bit.

E.g.  Brazil:

<TEXT> On wikipedia, the origin of the word *allegedly* comes from this quote:

How long is it going to take before lawyers realize that the simple act of trying to repress something they don't like online is likely to make it so that something that most people would never, ever see (like a photo of a urinal in some random beach resort) is now seen by many more people? Let's call it the Streisand Effect.

And I think that interpretation is shared by many people, as it's often cited alongside the line about the internet rerouting around censorship. But you're right in the sense the Wikipedia definition supports your point.

As sad as it is that the idealistic view of an internet that is self-correcting hasn't held up over the years, I do think many of us are willing to fight censorship when we find out about it, and that itself is pretty awesome. </TEXT>

They may not have succeeded at finding the right person, but they are clearly engaging in a criminal investigation of defamation from the website owner. Defamation charges are used to take down content, e.g. Jim Sterling's YT channel experienced a few well-known examples of it. Whether justified or not, it would still be a form of censorship.

Drake estimated that the charges had cost him over a million dollars in legal fees and lost work.

In June, Nehlen said that the TPP alone was enough reason to run against Ryan, saying it would cause the fundamental undoing of America.

This is some real fire and brimstone populism. We might be watching something interesting emerging in US politics. A lot of anger at the system.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's how I'm seeing it. Certain kinds of sudden activity for something as small as a comment strike me as sketch, especially on /r/technology - which doesn't usually get excited about trivial stories based entirely on one alleged comment.

For example on the politics subreddit, for a week all you saw was anger at the DNC email leak revelations, anger that a certain politician hired a Party member after resigning from the scandal in the emails, protests on the DNC floor (anti-war and anti-TPP), discussion of third parties, anger at moderator censorship and so-on.

However it currently has a very different narrative. Pretty much sole attention is on things Trump says or things Hillary says. Even outside of reddit, I see media personalities refer to the DNC as largely smooth   showed 'unity' (which if you look at what happened that week, you'd be scratching your head). It's jarring but I honestly think it's too late to undo the damage done in July. </TEXT>

Following that call, Tang telephoned Yu [the Intercept reporter in Hong Kong] directly in Hong Kong. Speaking with her in Cantonese, Tang was alternately threatening and cajoling, asking Yu to prevent The Intercept from referencing unverified claims on Chinese-language websites that he had been accused of smuggling, tax evasion, and bribery in Shantou. If she did, Tang said, when he came to Hong Kong the following week he would give her **a red packet of 200,000 dollars, so we can be friends, adding, I dont even know why you want to be a reporter, reporters make so little money.** </TEXT>

I wonder in what ways APIC is different from AIPAC, besides the obvious surface layer differences (like APIC is specifically for Asia)?

Also, interesting highlight from the article:

The story of APIC captures the bizarre reality of the U.S. political system: George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush between them appointed three of the five members of the Supreme Courts Citizens United majority; this majority opened up a loophole allowing foreign money to flow into U.S. elections; and this loophole was used to grab foreign money in an attempt to make a third Bush president. </TEXT>

Even usual claims of Republican vs Democrat and Left vs Right, that keep people divided and arguing non issues, isn't holding as much water in this environment. People are seeing the media spin, legal immunities, awkward improvisations from politicians not used to this environment, and political machines noticeably designed to serve a powerful   connected minority influence.

So many people of all backgrounds are seeing this that I doubt even an army of astroturfing can undo the damage done.

I know a lot of people are upset about this election, but for someone who has believed this was a worsening problem for years - it's been very satisfying to see the elites try to play their usual games unopposed. </TEXT>

[+]ISDS allows to undo dumb laws (*cough* sue taxpayers for pushing for unprofitable laws *cough*),

[+]trust me or read it yourself (all 5,000+ pages)

[+]I'm a lawyer so I'm right (in juxtaposition to credible sources that aren't faceless reddit accounts, like [Doctors Without Borders](http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/06/tpp-deal-leaked-pharma-000126)),

[+]it's only spreading existing US law to other countries (except when it's [not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership_Intellectual_Property_Provisions)),

[+]trade negotiations start off in secret (except for corporations involved and that secrecy [still continues](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160506/17281834365/european-parliament-orders-mep-to-take-down-video-about-his-attempt-to-visit-reading-room-trade-documents.shtml))

[EFF animation](https://youtube.com/watch?v=p3KlrfjcjV4) that goes slightly more into the tech side.

Intercept article [countering the claims it is some free trade deal](https://theintercept.com/2016/07/05/despite-what-media-says-tpp-isnt-about-free-trade-its-about-helping-corporations/)

Counter the claims it is merely extending US copyright law with this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership_Intellectual_Property_Provisions) largely based on a couple of studies that contrasts the TPP with US copyright law.

And the secrecy in the process *still* continues, as seen here in this [somewhat humorous situation](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160506/17281834365/european-parliament-orders-mep-to-take-down-video-about-his-attempt-to-visit-reading-room-trade-documents.shtml)

Remember there is way more than what is mentioned in these sources, likely due to the process it was negotiated in   their ambitions; but I hope sharing this helps with expanding your activist utility belt. Simply staying informed on this issue is opposing it, as it is evident that they have tried hard to prevent that (citing the article on secrecy and article on msm spin). </TEXT>

It's them who must do quality investigative reporting on leaked documents or citing financial conflicts of interests when talking about public servants. They are incredibly important to democracy, but often lacking or met with entrenched opposition. In countries including the US they face censorship, surveillance (e.g., Associated Press by DoJ), and mainstream media contempt.

E.g., Journalists had to do a lot of careful digging and studying to make sense of the raw NSA documents to explain to their readers. Glenn Greenwald's reporting (and fierce arguments with msm) is why I regularly read the Intercept, but it's up to us to figure out who to trust.  </TEXT>

There have been plenty of credible reporting (definitely more credible than establishment mouthpieces) on what the TPP really is. 

It isn't even a trade deal. The provisions inside go against even the ideals of free trade, it's just called that to sideline discussion away from the actual contents of the TPP.

In fact, the deals major impact would not come in the area of lowering tariffs, the most common trade barriers. The TPP is more focused on crafting regulatory regimes that benefit certain industries.

So the most consequential parts of the deal would actually undermine the free flow of goods and services by expanding some protectionist, anti-competitive policies sought by global corporations.

This got the subreddit delisted and the mods removed, and the old mods made a huge stink about it for weeks (and verbally countering their petty complaints resulted in dozens of down votes in even obscure inactive threads).

Now main guy who aggregated the original statistics proving the censorship was occurring is a mod there, and they found a way to resolve the complaints the old mods had (that people upvote the same topics repeatedly) without censorship by starting a tag-filter system. So if you ever complain that the subreddit sucks, it's your own fault for not taking advantage of the topic filter buttons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good article showing both sides of the concern on how Kaine will act. Highlights:

Kaines record on energy is mixed. Hes been supportive of offshore drilling in the Atlantic and introduced legislation to speed up liquid natural gas exports. In 2012 he pushed for the construction of one of the nations last new coal plants. And he helped pressure the federal government to lower Virginias greenhouse gas emissions goals under the Clean Power Plan.

In Virginia, the Atlantic Coast Pipelines biggest investor, Dominion, was the largest single corporate contributor to local politicians between 1997 and 2016, and Kaine has accepted his share of the companys cash and gifts: more than $300,000 in total since 2001. When asked what he thought of Kaine, senior American Petroleum Institute lobbyist Louis Finkel told Intercept reporter Zaid Jilani, Hes the best we could have hoped for. Virginias governor and longtime friend of the Clintons Terry McAuliffe supports the pipeline.

Still, many environmentalists consider Kaine someone who can be swayed. After all, he was one of the earliest legislators to declare opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have transported carbon-intensive tar sands oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast.

Last week, Oil Change International, which is dedicated to revealing the societal costs of fossil fuels, released a report that shows how the 19 proposed Appalachian Basin pipeline projects could fail such a climate test. According to the study, the Energy Information Administration projections of fossil fuel consumption suggest that even if the U.S. reduced all coal and petroleum use to zero by 2040, the U.S. would still exceed its climate goals based on natural gas emissions alone. Since pipeline investments would incentivize the production and shipment of natural gas for decades, the report says, the pipelines are inconsistent with the 2-degree climate goal </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this article's cathartic analysis applies to people all over right now. Both major parties are facing huge divisions as people express frustration over the how parties prioritize monied and established interests over their constituents. Part of what made Trump instantly stand out was his rhetoric about corruption and the status-quo. To clarify, I don't think rhetoric is a reliable indicator of policy (where political signalling like appointments is) - but it leads to the next point.

I honestly hope that the two parties do not get better at the deception that usually works for them. It's been amazing seeing people realize ways the system is stacked against them.

<TEXT> Well, neither party or candidate are particularly trustworthy. E.g., why should we believe Clinton when she says she's against the TPP when her VP is very pro TPP? There's a word for that in politics, it's called signalling. You say one thing to the voters, but appoint people with the views you want big financial/political backers to see.

By voting for Clinton, you are also supporting the "rigging of the DNC" shown in the leaked emails this week. In the next election, the Democratic Party will know that sufficiently demonizing an opponent will get enough people to vote for someone they didn't want in office.

And this isn't a defense of the Republican party either, but this is a reminder that both parties are not serving your interests. </TEXT>

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And despite **hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer,** Cohen has **spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress**, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate.

People get stuck on their rhetoric but on many issues, both parties (and the candidates they pick) aren't hugely different from each other. Heck, we have emails showing Hillary trying to promote fracking in other countries.

<TEXT> It [isn't even really about free trade.](https://theintercept.com/2016/07/05/despite-what-media-says-tpp-isnt-about-free-trade-its-about-helping-corporations/)

In fact, the deals major impact would not come in the area of lowering tariffs, the most common trade barriers. The TPP is more focused on crafting regulatory regimes that benefit certain industries.

So the most consequential parts of the deal would actually undermine the free flow of goods and services by expanding some protectionist, anti-competitive policies sought by global corporations.

Claims that it is [merely extending US law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership_Intellectual_Property_Provisions) or about free trade has been a part of a lot of misinformation on this [secretive](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160506/17281834365/european-parliament-orders-mep-to-take-down-video-about-his-attempt-to-visit-reading-room-trade-documents.shtml) agreement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Resistance/activism isn't only about voting. It's about resisting these trends in whichever way we can. It might be informing ourselves of the injustices so that we can angrily cite long lists of transgressions (backed by credible sources). The people responsible for those acts want us to forget them, and merely remembering them and reminding ourselves is an act of defiance.

Resistance might mean finding allies who openly take up these causes - people you can root for and cheer as they face huge challenges. Journalists, whistleblowers, organizations, and speakers.

Resistance might even be as little as changing small habits, e.g. using Tor to make mass surveillance more difficult.

Activism and resistance is about finding carthasis in how we express our growing frustration, not popularity.

And no matter how terrible or hopeless things seem, there are always people who are fighting against it. </TEXT>

Courtrooms across the nation are using computer programs to predict who will be a future criminal. The programs help inform decisions on everything from bail to sentencing. They are meant to make the criminal justice system fairer  and to weed out human biases.

<TEXT> It's also used any case that involves breaking DRM, including security research.

It's also used for a variety of other situations like **price fixing,** believe it or not. If you own a smart car, a mechanic will use a diagnostics tool that has to bypass the car's DRM protection. Thus, the maker of the tool (ie the maker of the car) will force the repair business to sign an agreement to use their diagnostic tool (which will bypass the DRM), which might include that the mechanic can only use parts made by the manufacturer in repairing the vehicle.

EFF member and sci-fi writer Cory Doctorow has talked about the problems of the DMCA at length. [Here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=zlN6wjeCJYk) is a recent talk he made at the Decentralized Web Summit that was hosted by the Internet Archive, graced (ironically) by the appearance of Tim Berners Lee.

I know for a fact Cory talks about it [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=f2IIoHNqJBs). He's a great speaker and I recommend listening to him if you commute anywhere or have time to listen.

<TEXT> What Gingrich failed to mention in his enthusiastic endorsement of the MEK, however, is that the Iranian dissidents previously spent three decades trying to achieve their aim through terrorist attacks, and some of their first victims were Americans. He also avoided talking about the fact that the groups terrorist cell was once based in Iraq, where it was armed and protected by Saddam Hussein.

In recent years, as The Intercept has reported, the MEK has poured millions of dollars into reinventing itself as a moderate political group ready to take power in Iran if Western-backed regime change ever takes place. To that end it lobbied successfully to be removed from the State Departments list of foreign terrorist organizations in 2012. The Iranian exiles achieved this over the apparent opposition of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in part by paying a long list of former United States officials hefty speaking fees of between $10,000 to $50,000 for hymns of praise like the one Gingrich delivered on Saturday in Paris, where the MEKs political wing held its annual Free Iran gala. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't about free trade. Few tarriffs remain between the US and existing trade partners. It's about things like copyright expansion ([not just spreading current US laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership_Intellectual_Property_)). And to this day, it is still being presented in [extreme secrecy.](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160506/17281834365/european-parliament-orders-mep-to-take-down-video-about-his-attempt-to-visit-reading-room-trade-documents.shtml)

In the past, the USTR has admitted that it demands such secrecy because if it had to reveal its positions publicly, the public wouldn't support the agreement.

In the US, this has led to ridiculous situations such as when Senator Ron Wyden, who at the time was the chair of the Senate's subcommittee on international trade, was not allowed to bring a staffer of his, who is an expert in international trade, with him to read the latest text of a trade negotiation. Because that went against the rules.

And it's been standard practice in the US that if a politician does want to see the documents, they can't bring anything with them (not just no staff, but no electronics, no way to write anything down). They can just "read and retain." The EU has been following the US's lead on this, with special "reading rooms" for elected officials where someone watches over their every move. Again, they're not allowed any electronics. They are allowed a pen and are given paper to write on, which is a modest improvement on the USTR's system, but still ridiculous. </TEXT>

Kissinger: Ecevit can be very helpful. Art will see the Germans on the way home and also see Haig to see about getting surplus parts out of stocks. And [Ambassador David] Bruce was helpful.

Esenbel: The Europeans should find ways to meet quick needs; for example, the Air Force needs spare parts. For other items that they can't find in the stocks, maybe you could make a deal with the Dutch or others to send it here. 

Macomber: That is illegal.

Kissinger: Before the Freedom of Information Act, I used to say at meetings, "The illegal we do immediately; the unconstitutional takes a little longer." [laughter] But since the Freedom of Information Act, I'm afraid to say things like that. We'll make a major effort.

I bet there's going to be a lot of misinformation circulated that conveniently ignores the glaring double standard.

However, I wonder what the US intelligence community is thinking - such a double standard must be impossible to ignore considering secrecy is a huge aspect of their work/life. They likely are often reminded of what happens when they break it, even accidentally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm most concerned by the expansion of copyrights. Also the extreme secrecy it is being presented in is telling. [For example](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160506/17281834365/european-parliament-orders-mep-to-take-down-video-about-his-attempt-to-visit-reading-room-trade-documents.shtml)

In the past, the USTR has admitted that it demands such secrecy because if it had to reveal its positions publicly, the public wouldn't support the agreement.

In the US, this has led to ridiculous situations such as when Senator Ron Wyden, who at the time was the chair of the Senate's subcommittee on international trade, was not allowed to bring a staffer of his, who is an expert in international trade, with him to read the latest text of a trade negotiation. Because that went against the rules.

And it's been standard practice in the US that if a politician does want to see the documents, they can't bring anything with them (not just no staff, but no electronics, no way to write anything down). They can just "read and retain." The EU has been following the US's lead on this, with special "reading rooms" for elected officials where someone watches over their every move. Again, they're not allowed any electronics. They are allowed a pen and are given paper to write on, which is a modest improvement on the USTR's system, but still ridiculous. </TEXT>

There are four parties using drones in this area: the U.S., U.K., Russia, and the Iranian groups. It could have been any one of them,

But I'm most doubtful of the numbers they released because, as commenters keep pointing out, they have officially defined in the past 'military combatants' as males that are 16 years old or older.

Still, does that mean 64-116 women or young children were killed by drones outside of warzones? I'm looking forward to hearing adversarial journalism give their critiques. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Coming from /r/technology where there is often active discussion of ads and adblockers, this article somewhat shows (to me) how limited ad money has impacted journalist business models.

E.g., Politico has sponsorships with a few interesting advocacy groups.

Politicos nearly non-stop programming during the conventions is led by the outlets award-winning team of reporters and editors. In both Cleveland and Philadelphia, Politico plans to hold a Caucus Energy Conversation sponsored by Vote4Energy.org, an election effort of the American Petroleum Institute, which is the lobbying arm of Chevron, ExxonMobil, and other major oil and gas companies.

Politico is also hosting a discussion of the economy with the Peter G. Peterson Institute, an advocacy group that pushes for cuts to Medicare and Social Security. Other Politico convention event sponsors include Microsoft, Diageo, Google, and Bank of America.

Vote4Energy is also listed as the underwriter for The Atlantics cocktail caucus during the Democratic convention to explore the nations energy and environment landscape.

Their conclusion sums it up well:

But the role of media outlets in embracing the same strategies is the latest sign that the ethical boundaries of journalism are changing.

As traditional advertising revenue has collapsed over the last two decades, many newspapers and magazines have turned to sponsored events for income. 

Many media outlets have embraced native advertising, an industry term for advertisements that looks like editorial content, except for a small disclosure to identify the content as sponsored. In 2013, the Atlantic briefly hosted an advertorial from the Church of Scientology that promoted controversial leader David Miscavige. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But if the NSL is trying to identify a leaker by targeting the records of the potential source, and not the journalist, the Justice Department doesnt need to be involved.

Wow, that sounds like a rule on how to merely phrase the requirement.

The guidelines also specify that the extra oversight layers do not apply if the journalist is believed to be a spy or is part of a news organization associated with a foreign intelligence service or otherwise acting on behalf of a foreign power. Unless, again, the purpose is to identify a leak, in which case, the general counsel and executive assistant director must approve the request.

Even better, if the requirement claims the journalists are working with Russia - it's okay.

In seriousness, I wonder if that second part was specifically referring to Wikileaks. Whenever a Wikileaks or Snowden appears, it seems like rumors get spread that they're working for China or Russia. 

I get the impression this happens a lot internally because I once read about a FOIA requester who found out that gov officials were spreading rumors internally that the guy was crazy. Going to look for the source.

A number of activists and even charitable organizations have been incorrectly added to the terrorism subcategory of the database, according to a report from Vice. These inaccurate records could be very destructive now that the list has been leaked.

An aspect about privacy and surveillance that tons of people underestimate. </TEXT>

However, I'm not sure if the larger issue is totally resolved thanks to IntelME. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the topic of Intel backdoors, as they played a major role in the controversy: Intel chipsets are becoming increasingly a concern from both a security and transparency perspective. Below I link to a paper written on it that mentions that, among other things, allows for plausible deniability to backdoors.

See here for additonal information: [Recent article](https://boingboing.net/2016/06/15/intel-x86-processors-ship-with.html) [Brief Summary](https://libreboot.org/faq/#intelme), [paper](http://blog.invisiblethings.org/papers/2015/x86_harmful.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6bJ5b8Dgoc)

<TEXT> Of the tech companies, I'm most glad Cisco had their reputation tarnished. Their business with China puts them on a Nestle level of evil.

See Cisco's role in selling surveillance equipment to China that was [**advertised** to hunt down a religious minority](https://www.wired.com/2008/05/leaked-cisco-do/) "that combines meditation and qigong exercises with a moral philosophy centered on the tenets of truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance" ([from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong))

See the [brutalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Falun_Gong) of these people, such as **"some 64,000 Falun Gong prisoners may have been killed for their organs between the years 2000 and 2008"**

How the NSA destroyed their reputation with China was the closest thing to justice I'll probably ever see for what they did. </TEXT>

 "In this article on Declan McCullagh's Politech, **Symantec chief researcher Eric Chien stated that provided a hypothetical keystroke logging tool was used only by the FBI, Symantec would avoid updating its antivirus tools to detect such a Trojan, echoing a similar stance Network Associates allegedly took with its McAfee anti-virus software earlier this week.** 'If it was under the control of the FBI, with appropriate technical safeguards in place to prevent possible misuse, and nobody else used it -- we wouldn't detect it,' said Chien. 'However we would detect modified versions that might be used by hackers.'"

But I'm glad many here already understand that more surveillance won't help considering what the FBI knew about the shooter. Here's [an article](https://theintercept.com/2016/06/25/fbis-secret-surveillance-tech-budget-is-hundreds-of-millions/) about how the FBI has greatly expanded surveillance project funding, with nothing to do with the Orlando events.

Relevant excerpt from [another](https://theintercept.com/2016/06/21/democrats-war-on-due-process-and-terrorist-fear-mongering-long-pre-dates-orlando/) Intercept article on this issue but also mentioning killing Americans without trial etc

consider this 1987 New York Times editorial raging against Reagan Attorney General Ed Meese for arguing that criminal suspects dont deserve Miranda warnings. Meeses rationale: You dont have many suspects who are innocent of crime. Thats contradictory. If a person is innocent of a crime, then he is not a suspect. Said the NYT editors in response: In other words, guilty until proven guilty. Thats exactly what Elizabeth Warren and Chris Murphy believe: **If the U.S. government views you as suspicious, that is proof of your guilt.** Thus, a suspect is the same as ISIS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its unusual for a case to go eight years before reaching this point, called discovery, the routine process by which one party obtains evidence to support their case from another party. But we were barred from conducting discovery since 2008 because the government succeeded in putting evidence gathering on hold while it tried to get the case thrown outthereby preventing us from requesting important information about how the NSAs mass surveillance programs worked. But the government failed to get the case thrown out.

As for others who rarely speak like this, I wonder how relevant something Cory Doctorow said at the Internet Archive's "Decentralized Web Summit?"

"They are people who believed that others would not back their play. That doing the right thing will be self limiting. When we are alone, and when we believe we are alone, we are weak."

<TEXT> Time Warner Cable's Maxx upgrades not only deliver faster top speeds up to 300 Mbps, but a notably overhauled improvement to the company's set top box interface. But Time Warner Cable has been telling company support techs and engineers that the upgrades were actually put on hold as of May 26.

The memo implies Charter is taking inventory of the acquired companies and is busy plotting a course forward.

"The Maxx Internet Speed Increase Program is currently undergoing review by our leadership team," says a memo obtained by Stop the Cap.

"As a result, all speed increases and customer communications were placed on a temporary hold beginning Thursday, May 26," states the internal communication. "Once the updated launch schedule is determined, updated hub schedules will be posted to KEY and area management will be notified. Customers will continue to receive notification when the new speeds are available in their hubs."

The article also warns to expect price hikes to happen later, but besides that - I don't think this article is saying what people are thinking it's saying. Wish they did use the better title you suggested. </TEXT>

[A statement from the source of the Panama Papers:](https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160506-john-doe-statement.html)

...while Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network at the United States Treasury, just announced her resignation to work instead for HSBC, one of the most notorious banks on the planet (not coincidentally headquartered in London). And so the familiar swish of Americas revolving door echoes amidst deafening global silence from thousands of yet-to-be-discovered ultimate beneficial owners who are likely praying that her replacement is equally spineless.

But [Regulatory Capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture) describes only part of the story.

The [Vice President of Comcast](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) has been seen working with Republicans and Democrats.

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And the State Department's efforts to [spread fracking into Poland (which would then hopefully spread to other countries)](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/23/hillary-clinton-fracking/)

An email dated December 3, 2010, shows that the State Department had Poland firmly in its bulls-eye and that companies such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, Marathon Oil, Canadian firm BNK Petroleum, and Italian energy company Eni expressed interest in tapping into Polish shale. One official suggested enlisting Eni to help organize the pro-fracking campaign in Poland, as well as bringing in U.S. companies.

<TEXT> In its documentation of APFS, Apple explains that full disk encryption has been available on OS X since version 10.7 Lion. APFS differs in that it encrypts files individually rather than as a one unit, similar to other encryption mechanisms Apple introduced to its iOS platform in 2010. It also encrypts related metadata  the basic summary attached to each file  and will keen data secure even when the device has been physically hacked.

I am excited for what is coming from Apple as of late. 

Many of the features announced at WWDC expand security of user data, something Apple has been keen to promote as protecting user privacy. Safeguards include running artificial intelligence on the device itself, rather thanin the cloud, and using a technology called [differential privacy,](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/apples-differential-privacy-collecting-data/) which anonymizes data Apple does collect from its customers. 

Also, the article mentions WhatsApp. Surprisingly, [OpenWhisperSystems helped them implement their encryption.](https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/)

Of course, there are still issues with all of these services/technologies (like privacy with WhatsApp, trusting closed source software with Apple) - but it is really nice seeing some of the positive actions they have taken.  </TEXT>

Here's a source for the future you can cite:

and 

https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/04/truecrypt_secur.html

I haven't found any evidence yet to suggest that TrueCrypt is dangerous to use currently. I personally use an open source derivative to TC called VeraCrypt (which adds some extra nifty security features). </TEXT>

<TEXT> TrueCrypt actually went through a [rigorous security audit](http://istruecryptauditedyet.com/) last year.

Schneier [said this about it](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/04/truecrypt_secur.html): 

The security audit of the TrueCrypt code has been completed (see here for the first phase of the audit), and the results are good. Some issues were found, but nothing major.

Nothing that would make me not use the program, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well said. However I think mainstream media is a lost cause. Even in a perfect world where media is forced to 'fact check,' that's an easily abusable requirement. I don't think we ever want anyone to be forced to write something in a particular way. I think it's best to just avoid them and point out the holes in their reporting (e.g., I have [lots of NYT examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4n3sny/according_to_ceo_thompson_of_the_new_york_times/d428qle), and it's easy to point how quickly MSM stopped reporting on the NSA disclosures and focused entirely on Snowden)

There is quality investigative journalism out there, it's often a matter of finding them and keeping up with "what needs to be changed, what terrible new laws or agreements are on their way, and who is a bad actor and needs to be publicly denounced or removed from office" etc.

You're right, there is so much disinformation and obstacles to breaking down traditional world views. Still, I think education/raising awareness has a lot of potential. There are many stories that are undeniably terrible and eye opening to anyone. IRL I've made people reconsider their stance on surveillance and censorship with reliable/strong sources detailing raw   brutal truths, like how UK censorship laws were [abused](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire_toxic_waste_dump) in the Trafigura case to benefit a company that was hurting people.

Despite the cynicism you see in many online comments, rarely are people actually heartless   uncaring. Often they're just uninformed thanks to all those elements you described. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we can somewhat counter it by raising awarenes, online   IRL, that old cards like "Democrats vs Republicans," "liberals vs conservatives," and "us vs extremists" are complete bs. With reliable sources/evidence, we can show the abuses of power, the injustices, and common tricks that elites use to obtain influence   distract the public.

Additionally, I think the astroturfing problem is only going to get worse and posting sources   evidence is the only counter I can think of. The reason being that I still read comments that are heavily downvoted   I bet others do too. If people still end up reading evidence/sources, astroturfing has failed in completely stamping out information from spreading.

Have any ideas about the problems we're facing now   in the future? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Huh? Deep into conspiracies? The Wikipedia article (which is based on the Associated Press articles) I linked on the "journalists have been surveilled and prosecuted by the DOJ" bullet is an example of abusing surveillance power. 

I think you mean dragnet mass surveillance is overrated. I agree with part of that, in that it hasn't been helpful for preventing attacks. However, it can be turned on activists, whistleblowers, and journalists (such as in the above case). It also contains a lot of blackmail or discrediting information that can be used against political opponents. 

Recently [Forty-One Secret Service agents tried to access a Congressman's private data to discredit him,](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160604/13455634625/forty-one-secret-service-employees-punished-illegally-accessing-congressmans-private-data-hopes-discrediting-him.shtml) and the punishments were mostly warnings. 

if an incident occurs, then they winnow in on a specific person and make connections

Somewhat. It depends. If we're talking about their program SKYNET[1], they try to use machine learning algorithms to make predictions about behavior which escalates people on kill lists. Unfortunately, a data scientist has [estimated](http://arstechnica.co.uk/security/2016/02/the-nsas-skynet-program-may-be-killing-thousands-of-innocent-people/) that thousands of innocent people are being misclassified - and possibly killed as a result.


 But to actually get info about a person while on line or the phone? Not possible.

This confused me. Do you mean in terms of their technical capabilities? They already have programs to automate infecting devices such as [TURBINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TURBINE_%28US_government_project%29) and the [QUANTUM programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations#QUANTUM_attacks).

[+] the CIA has resisted the Senate's Intelligence Committee (which serves as an oversight committee) torture investigations by [repeatedly lying to Congress, hacking Senate computers, deleting video evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Intelligence_Committee_report_on_CIA_torture)

[+] people from the executive branch like [Admiral Poindexter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Poindexter) and [James Clapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_R._Clapper) can lie to Congress without consequence, and one of those two even returned with an unpopular [mass surveillance program that was shut down by Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office) that nonetheless continued   expanded under different names

[+] whistleblowers going through proper channels within the executive branch are [hunted down,](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/22/how-pentagon-punished-nsa-whistleblowers) even at gunpoint

[+] journalists have been [surveilled and prosecuted by the DOJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Department_of_Justice_investigations_of_reporters)

and the largest surveillance program in history existed and grew for over a decade without public knowledge.

With such lacking transparency, how do you hold the executive branch accountable? Wouldn't you say credibility is important? If someone is willing to lie now, what will happen when keeping secrets becomes even easier?

I mean, even the [Vice President of Comcast](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) has been seen working with Republicans and Democrats.

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And despite **hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer,** Cohen has **spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress**, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate

It's a game run by   for elites. If we are to protect our civil liberties from unrelenting assault, I think paying attention to this game (not the tabloid trash)   showing others is in our interests.

If you do not wish to read it (or trust the leaked documents), here is a direct quote from Hillary on [State.gov](http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2010/04/140286.htm)

the United States will promote the use of [shale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale_gas) gas. Now, I know that in some places is controversial.

<TEXT> I'm not a leader with an organized plan, but I can suggest trying to find ways to resist this trend. If these things upset you as much as they upset me, you'll get good feelings from little ways you can resist them.

I try to stay informed   track sources, so that I can show others (online   IRL) exactly what is happening - backed with hard to deny evidence. That's something the Internet currently gives us, e.g., primary source documents on NSA programs, articles about thousands of innocent people being misclassified as terrorists under SKYNET (actual name of program), how the UK government used its censorship powers to hide coverage of Trafigura's waste dumping into drinking water, how money is funneled, and many other stories.

There are countless stories that speak for themselves on why certain things are bad. And I've had success changing people's views from even defending censorship   surveillance to realizing they are abusable powers that have already been abused.

Also as a tiny bit of resistance, I use TOR for almost everything. If I can make marketing and government surveillance a tiny bit harder, I am also doing something better than sitting and feeling dread.

There are organizations that are already combating these trends that we can donate to. They are experts in their own fields, like security or law, unlike most of us. </TEXT>

Meanwhile, ["Forty-One Secret Service Employees Punished For Illegally Accessing Congressman's Private Data In Hopes Of Discrediting Him"](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160604/13455634625/forty-one-secret-service-employees-punished-illegally-accessing-congressmans-private-data-hopes-discrediting-him.shtml)

In all, the conduct of 57 Secret Service personnel was reviewed, including 11 at the SES [Senior Executive Service] level. Of those, 41 are receiving some level of discipline. This discipline includes a letter of reprimand to one individual, suspended discipline contingent on no further misconduct for a period of five years, and suspensions from duty without pay for periods of up to 45 days. The one individual found by the Inspector General to have disclosed the private information to an outside source, the Washington Post, has resigned from the Secret Service.

As is often the case, the employee whose misconduct was the worst slipped out the door before the hammer could come down.

Note what the "punishment" was. Heck, the [first known iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office)* of these modern surveillance programs was started by [Admiral Poindexter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Poindexter) - a man who lied to Congress and got away with it.

<TEXT> But there are new tools. The internet is both the biggest threat and biggest opportunity for democracy. We are at the tipping point where this tool can be used by activists to sidestep traditional censored   controlled soapboxes unlike before or by elites to usher in a era of surveillance and censorship unlike ever seen.

We are losing globally but I don't think it's a decided match yet. </TEXT>

In all, the conduct of 57 Secret Service personnel was reviewed, including 11 at the SES [Senior Executive Service] level. Of those, 41 are receiving some level of discipline. This discipline includes a letter of reprimand to one individual, suspended discipline contingent on no further misconduct for a period of five years, and suspensions from duty without pay for periods of up to 45 days. The one individual found by the Inspector General to have disclosed the private information to an outside source, the Washington Post, has resigned from the Secret Service.

As is often the case, the employee whose misconduct was the worst slipped out the door before the hammer could come down.

It seems the consequences for abusing this data are really tough. /s </TEXT>

[Removal of British political speeches](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/13/conservative-party-archive-speeches-internet)

[Campaign promises from US President](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/07/25/obama-promises-disappear-from-web/) - however it has been said that there was no malicious intent in the promises disappearing, still, the Archive makes it much harder to rewrite political history.

There are many more, but don't have time to dig deeper now. I hope it is already clear to most here that censorship is growing on [a global scale](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/government-censorship-21st-century-internet/385528/), and it is in all of our interests that we have the Archive to retrieve what is removed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Literally every one of those things can be learned by having a conversation with someone

I almost agree. There are things some people say online that they wouldn't say in an conversation because they think they have more privacy behind a pseudonym.

The larger point is that the information can be data-mined for future analyses with rapidly improving algorithms in a booming industry.

Most peoples reddit accounts are just a conglomeration of the things that they like to do. Nothing important.

Well, interests are already marketable data and contribute to building profiles on individuals. Behavioral data, like how you speak, if you upvote articles before reading them, etc are data that can also be mined, extracted, and saved as part of a person's history.

I'm not saying that all of these things are currently being done on reddit - but it can be done and has been done for research purposes and by a very large data company. Surely you've heard a few examples? I don't mind citing them if you want. Like I said, it's a booming industry and examples are easy to find. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Facebook doesn't invade privacy. People give Facebook their privacy.

I highly recommend you check [this aggregate list of cases](https://stallman.org/facebook.html) where Facebook has quite indeed taken privacy from unsuspecting people. 

Facebook, as an "experiment", collected the text its useds started to enter as status updates and ultimately did not send. 

This page gives details about how much Facebook tracks browsing, which applies even to users that don't have Facebook accounts.

Facebook's tracking of users through cookies combined with Like buttons violates EU law. [note, social media buttons track online browsing simply by loading a page with the button on it]

Facebook asks its useds to provide their entire list of other people's email addresses.

In addition, Facebook secretly collects useds' phone numbers. [the author forgets to cite a source, so [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/28/facebook-android-app-phone-numbers_n_3518652.html)]

Facebook's mobile app snoops on SMS messages.[more informative source](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/facebook-reading-android-users-texts-well-hold-on/)

It's a huge reason as to why the company has such a sketch reputation. I think you'll be hardpressed to find many real people who truly trust the company.

<TEXT> Speaking of that candidate, I'm nervous what will happen if Correct the Record hijacks threads here on /r/technology. 

[This comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4l5j1n/gop_pushing_bill_that_guts_fcc_authority_kills/d3kqpph) sounded sketch. [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4l5j1n/gop_pushing_bill_that_guts_fcc_authority_kills/d3krnck) points it out and gets the standard response that only "regular people" are contributing to Hillary's campaign. Apparently the [Vice President of Comcast (among others)](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) is just a "regular person" with no ties to Comcast's interests.

 "In this article on Declan McCullagh's Politech, Symantec chief researcher Eric Chien stated that provided a hypothetical keystroke logging tool was used only by the FBI, Symantec would avoid updating its antivirus tools to detect such a Trojan, echoing a similar stance Network Associates allegedly took with its McAfee anti-virus software earlier this week. 'If it was under the control of the FBI, with appropriate technical safeguards in place to prevent possible misuse, and nobody else used it -- we wouldn't detect it,' said Chien. 'However we would detect modified versions that might be used by hackers.'" twitter facebook linkedin

David Cohen is the special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

<TEXT> This subreddit used to censor topics like this one, until a couple redditors [proved](https://reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/22yewf/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are/) that the censorship was occurring. 

The old mods were removed (and they made a huge stink over it) and one of the redditors who revealed this was happening became a moderator here! Amazing story.

Some great [quotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/1zcqvm/7129932470_verizon_ceo_lowell_mcadam_suggested/cfsq39d) from there too, this one from /u/maxwellhill (the same redditor who also posted this story today):

Other mods (not all) disagreed with such topic or domain being in r/technology. I think it is because it's sort of politics related rather than being purely a technology post or the domain is considered blogspam. I am intrigued as to which subreddit it should be if not r/technology. I doubt if it is suitable for politics... any idea?

I still think such posts are precisely what r/technology is about eg. SOPA, net neutrality, Internet-related posts, privacy issues, NSA etc.

Unfortunately such posts are invariably politically related. If we exclude them we miss out on many interesting discussions in r/technology eg the technology used by NSA to eavesdrop etc. But these are just my own opinions which the other mods would probably disagree with.

<TEXT> I agree. The source of the Panama Papers talked on your last point in [this article](https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160506-john-doe-statement.html) You might find the rest cathartic to read as I did.

 In Britain, the Tories have been shameless about concealing their own practices involving offshore companies, while Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network at the United States Treasury, just announced her resignation to work instead for HSBC, one of the most notorious banks on the planet (not coincidentally headquartered in London). And so the familiar swish of Americas revolving door echoes amidst deafening global silence from thousands of yet-to-be-discovered ultimate beneficial owners who are likely praying that her replacement is equally spineless. In the face of political cowardice, its tempting to yield to defeatism, to argue that the status quo remains fundamentally unchanged, while the Panama Papers are, if nothing else, a glaring symptom of our societys progressively diseased and decaying moral fabric.

But the issue is finally on the table, and that change takes time is no surprise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Another redditor gave term for it: [Regulatory Capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture)

Regulatory capture is a form of government failure that occurs when a regulatory agency, created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special interest groups that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating. When regulatory capture occurs the interests of firms or political groups are prioritised over the interests of the public, leading to a net loss to society as a whole. Government agencies suffering regulatory capture are called "captured agencies".

Recently, some members of the US Copyright Office said some [strange things](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160517/17541834469/dozen-bad-ideas-that-were-raised-copyright-offices-dmca-roundtables.shtml) even after the EFF sent them an [excellent list of take down abuses](https://www.eff.org/document/eff-512-study-comments) (see page 12 onwards)

Edit: For anyone who doesn't see powerful minority interests influencing both parties, see [my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4l5j1n/gop_pushing_bill_that_guts_fcc_authority_kills/d3kohcp) where I show a Comcast VP literally working inside both parties (among other people) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't even end there. [From the Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/). 

1.

**David Cohen is the special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast,** overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy. 

And despite hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer, Cohen has spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate.

2.

The Host Committees finance chair is Daniel Hilferty.

Hilferty has also donated heavily to Republicans this cycle, giving $10,000 to Prosperity for Pennsylvania, a Super PAC supporting the re-election of Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa.; $1,000 to the PAC supporting Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; $1,000 to Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.; $2,700 to Chris Christies presidential campaign; $25,300 to the NRCC, a GOP committee designed to re-elect House Republicans; and $2,700 to Jeb Bush. Hilferty also gave $2,700 to Hillary Clintons campaign.

3.

The Philadelphia Host Committee chair, former Gov. Ed Rendell, headed for Wall Street as soon as he left office and has since represented a number of controversial special interests. In 2011, as New York was debating regulations on fracking, Rendell wrote a pro-fracking opinion column in the New York Daily News, while failing to disclose that he was a paid consultant at a private equity firm that had investments in the industry.

That same year, Rendell started providing paid speeches on behalf of the Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK), a fringe Iranian exile group that was considered a terrorist organization by the State Department at the time (it was delisted in 2012).

The former governor also joined the group Fix the Debt  an organization backed by private equity billionaire Pete Peterson that advocates for cutting Social Security benefits  co-chairing its activities alongside Judd Gregg.

And more of us should be paying attention to [AIPAC](https://theintercept.com/2015/11/05/leaked-emails-from-pro-clinton-group-reveal-censorship-of-staff-on-israel-aipac-pandering-warped-militarism/), as their practices seem like a scary threat to self-determination. E.g., donors to the group might succeed in pushing the official future US foreign policy in a particular extreme direction.

Note how in this post, I cited individuals funding Republicans and Democrats. These parties have increasingly represented a powerful minority with deep pockets and connections. </TEXT>

See the [brutalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Falun_Gong) of these people, such as **"some 64,000 Falun Gong prisoners may have been killed for their organs between the years 2000 and 2008"**

Now contrast that with what commenters here were saying [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wikipedia/comments/2ao2m9/falun_gong_is_a_qigong_discipline_combining/)

Top comment (and many more below that one): 
I usually see the Falun Gong defended on reddit, or at least given sympathy, when they smuggle notes into handbags/toilet seats etc saying they are being worked to death in Chinese prisons.

For context, the Falun Gong are straight up insane. They are like the Chinese version of Scientology and like everything in China, it's bigger, crazier and completely illogical. They believe all sorts of insane shit - stuff that would make L. Ron Hubbard blush.

They are evil and twisted. They get no sympathy from me.

<TEXT> Saw this and felt a little sad that the effects of the censorship in 2013 is impossible to ignore in these statistics. The NSA was constantly being discussed on the subreddit from what I could tell at the time.

Anyone not familiar with this can see the subreddit and the redditor who revealed the extent of what the old /r/technology mods did [here](https://reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/22yewf/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of comments here are focusing on the good old 'left versus right' dynamic where the larger issue is that Facebook is doing this at all. Falsely suggesting to people that some things are trending and other things are NEVER trending is propaganda; and while many of us do not use Facebook or trust it - hundreds of millions of people will not ever know this is even happening.

We should all be concerned about how much influence companies like Facebook can have over democracy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are many powerful lines from what 'John Doe' wrote. Here's an one great excerpt:

Reform of Americas broken campaign finance system cannot wait.

Of course, those are hardly the only issues that need fixing. Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand has been curiously quiet about his countrys role in enabling the financial fraud Mecca that is the Cook Islands. In Britain, the Tories have been shameless about concealing their own practices involving offshore companies, while Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network at the United States Treasury, just announced her resignation to work instead for HSBC, one of the most notorious banks on the planet (not coincidentally headquartered in London). And so the familiar swish of Americas revolving door echoes amidst deafening global silence from thousands of yet-to-be-discovered ultimate beneficial owners who are likely praying that her replacement is equally spineless. In the face of political cowardice, its tempting to yield to defeatism, to argue that the status quo remains fundamentally unchanged, while the Panama Papers are, if nothing else, a glaring symptom of our societys progressively diseased and decaying moral fabric. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just did. Argued the essay titled "The Revolution Will Be Digitized" talks about how technological trends may affect the political issues relevant to the panama papers.

Historians can easily recount how issues involving taxation and imbalances of power have led to revolutions in ages past. Then, military might was necessary to subjugate peoples, whereas now, curtailing information access is just as effective or more so, since the act is often invisible. Yet we live in a time of inexpensive, limitless digital storage and fast internet connections that transcend national boundaries. It doesnt take much to connect the dots: from start to finish, inception to global media distribution, the next revolution will be digitized. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes it's funny when you put into context exactly what some of these arguments are okaying. Tons of these programs are targeting millions and millions of people, which totally sounds like 'just governments spying on each other duh, we shouldn't be questioning them /s' Congress even shut down a [very similar program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Information_Awareness) under Bush - and the founder of THAT program is none other than the [man who was caught lying to Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Poindexter) about [a secret program that WAS illegal and unconstitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair)

Among the tons and tons of things in the Snowden documents, NSA actually weakened security standards that companies use. Most infamously was getting NIST to approve an [obviously weak cryptography algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG) (many experts knew at the time, but NIST defended their trash), and then **[bribing RSA $10 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_BSAFE) to put it into one of their security products.**

They also [compromised systems at Google and Yahoo,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSCULAR_%28surveillance_program%29) leeching data from their unwitting users. Officially these companies have denied involvement, which if-true, is another case of the NSA attacking US tech companies. 

[OpticNerve:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_Nerve_%28GCHQ%29) " surreptitiously collects private webcam still images from users while they are using a Yahoo! webcam application. As an example of the scale, in one 6-month period, the program is reported to have collected images from 1.8 million Yahoo! user accounts globally."

The NSA also intercepts packages so they can put hardware backdoors into products in shipments, which has [absolutely tarnished](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140523/18092027352/ups-insists-that-it-is-not-helping-nsa-interdict-packages-to-install-backdoors.shtml) the reputation of sellout corporations like Cisco who once enjoyed selling surveillance equipment to China (see what [role](http://www.wired.com/2008/05/leaked-cisco-do/) they played in [brutalizing these people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Falun_Gong) in China.) </TEXT>
