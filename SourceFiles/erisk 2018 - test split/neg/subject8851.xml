<TEXT>  As someone who LITERALLY studied not only Brian De Palma and Hitchcock, but their STRAIGHT UP influences such as Soviet Film Theory with names like Eisenstein, Kuleshov, etc. You give people like De Palma and Hitchcock too much credit they didnt invent everything they use its called artistic theft, or as it is better known colloquially as their influences. 

Obviously every artist is influenced by others, when did I ever argued otherwise? The fact that De Palma is influenced by Hitchcock (And Hitchcock by Murnau and so on) among others doesn't change the fact that he is major visual artist. 

 I recommend looking into editing theory because a lot of your favorite moments in film are responsible thanks to godlike editors.

Are you serious? This is subreddit for filmmakers and you think it's some kind of reveleation when you tell us that there is such people as editors?

 A lot of your favorite images in the frame are there because of the production designer see the career of Richard Sylbert 

Thank you for that information. Nobody else here knew that there is such a people as production designers. You surely showed us your superior knowledge. /s

<TEXT> Especially because of stuff like HBO and Netflix releasing quality content all the time.

TV is absolute no replacement for cinema. 

Cinema is about atmosphere, TV is about information. Cinema is director's medium, Tv is writer's medium.

TV is ruled by show runners and directors change from episode to episode and every single one of them has to adhere to same visual style that was set on first episodes. There is no freedom for visual stylists like Brian De Palma or Hitchcock.

And that's why I think that movies are vastly superior art form when compared to television. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   What's more, these were mainstream, popular films at the time. Fellini made 8 1/2, one of if not the greatest statement on the creative process and film-making at the height of his career and popularity. There is no 2017 equivalent of Fellini.

This is something that many young people don't seem to understand (Some do, like I'm in my 20s myself, but I read film history). Filmmakers like Fellini and Antonioni were almost household names to the point of being interviewed in Playboy magazine in 1960s. That's pretty big difference to the mainstream recognition of someone like Paolo Sorrentino these days.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You go look at interviews of people like Francis Ford Coppola and they will tell you that financing film like The Godfather would be next to impossible in today's market place. 

You talk all you want about how art is only thing giving meaning to your life, but without someone financing your films, your not gonna make films like The Godfather or Chinatown. Maybe you can DSLR mumblecore films on your bed room without money, but if you have more cinematic ambitions, then the market place matters. And to act like that haven't changed for worse since 1970s is just ridiculous.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>   I remember when I was a teen in 1997, and reading about LA Confidential, a Warner Bros exec said in an interview that he would be really disappointed and worried for film if they couldn't still make movies like LA Confidential anymore. We're slowly getting there.

<TEXT>  You might want to take a closer look at Vera Miles in Liberty Valance. Particularly who she ends up choosing in life and what roles each of those men played in the advancement of civilization in Shinbone.

But is she actually happy with that choice at the end of the film? I mean I'm really not sure, so I'm genuinely asking. I think this film is so much more complex than most of people realize.

 Also, I'm not sure Jimmy Stewart wearing an apron, washing dishes and waiting tables is what would be considered traditional.


Funny thing about Liberty Valance is that this assumedly "unmanly politico" is actually brave to the point of being suicidal while facing Liberty Valance face to face while "real manly traditional western hero" shoots behind the back from the shadows.

But Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is great example to pick, because while on first look it might seem like the most traditional old Hollywood Western, it's actually really progressive film, just like Hawks' Red River, but even more so.

<TEXT> I'd say even the best stuff of now is better than the best stuff of then.

Bullshit. Sure, there are still great films being made, but on average cinema is nowhere near the quality of what it was for example in 70s.

All the following films were released between years 1970-1980:

The Godfather 1   2 , Days of Heaven, Chinatown, Deer Hunter, Heaven's Gate, The Conversation, Nashville, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, McCabe   Mrs. Miller, 1900, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, Taxi Driver, Annie Hall, Alien, All The President's Men, Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, Badlands, The Exorcist, Death in Venice, Jaws, Five Easy Pieces, Last Tango in Paris, The Sting, Klute, Close Encounters of Third Kind, Cabaret, All That Jazz, Raging Bull, The Shining, Apocalypse Now, The Ascent, Carrie, Dogday Afternoon, Don't Look Now, The French Connection, Aguirre, Ali: Fear Eats the Soul, Halloween, The Last Picture Show, Paper Moon, The Killing of Chinese Bookie, The Long Goodbye, Mean Streets, Mirror, The Conformist, The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Stalker, Suspiria, Texas Chain Saw Massacre, A Woman Under the Influence, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, F for Fake.


Good luck trying to make list from last 10 years that can match that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TV, I dont think has taken that place. Not yet, adds Scorsese, whose Boardwalk Empire was lauded but whose high-priced Vinyl was cancelled after one season. I tried it. I had success to a certain extent. Vinyl we tried but we found that the atmosphere for the type of picture we wanted to make  the nature of the language, the drugs, the sex, depicting the rock n roll world of the 70s  we got a lot of resistance. So I dont know about that freedom. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The sheer arrogance of r/movies is astonishing. Here is a legend who has made films in Hollywood over 50 years, some of them most succesful in the history. He has also produced tons of films and has even owned small film studio. He knows probably everyone who is of any importance in film business and even his children are filmmakers so he has frontrow seat to observe what is it like to be young filmmaker these days. So I'd say that when tells you something about filmmaking, maybe shut up and listen.

And while he may have exaggarated little to make a point, the fact is that getting this type of mid-budget films made is getting harder and harder all the time. And it's not just Coppola saying it. Very recently both Scorsese and James Gray said almost exactly the same thing in interviews. Even people like Spielberg and Lucas have talked about the death of mid-budget cinema.

But of course r/movies redditors who have never made a single film in their life are the ones who actually know how film industry has evolved in last decades /s

<TEXT>   I would have expect Cimino would have taken more then two years to both write and direct a film of such epic proportions.

Cimino had written first draft of Heaven's Gate (then called The Johnson County War) all the way back in 1971 but the project was shelved when it failed to attract big-name talent. Later success with The Deer Hunter changed that and Cimino was able to make any film he wanted. The actual filming took place from April 1979 to March 1980.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Is Heaven's Gate really just underrated and worth seeing?

Yes, absolutely. It's the most unfairly treated film in the history of cinema in my opinion. It's film equivalent of Great American Novel.

I have avoided due to 1) it's length

The definitive version approved by Cimino is little over 3 and half hour. The version that was over 5 hours was just work print that was showed for studio executives and it was never shown in public. For some strange reason IMDB misleads public and shows that over 5 hours length as it's official length. Criterion has put out the version approved by Cimino that I suggest you look up if you want to see the film.

2) it's infamous bankruptcy of United Artists 3) awful to merely tepid reviews, particularly Roger Ebert's.

There have been books written about why Heaven's Gate flopped as badly as it did, so I'm not gonna go there in depth. It's combination of many things, none that has to do with the quality of it as a work of art. Ultimately it's film about class war between American Establishment and poor Eastern European immigrants that was released just when the country had voted Ronald Reagan to President, so it's not hard to see why it might not have tapped into the zeitgeist of that moment. 

I see that you love McCabe and Mrs. Miller so I think you definitely should watch Heaven's Gate as well. I copy here  what in some other Reddit thread about Heaven's Gate:


It's an American epic on a scale not seen before or since, or likely ever again, Heaven's Gate is an unfairly maligned masterpiece. Running a colossal 219 minutes, the film is bursting with spectacular visuals, impressive technical work, and a collection of great performances from the likes of Kris Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert, Christopher Walken, and Jeff Bridges.

This film look absolutely stunning. Cimino makes use of light, shadows, dust, and smoke to create some of the most gorgeous shots ever put to film. Sunlight pokes through shutters, windows, and the tops of trees to cast beautiful streams of light across the frame. Clouds roll in, casting everything in shadow before moving on. Dust kicked up by horses and carriages swirls across the landscapes. Smoke billowing off trains, homes, and buildings engulf entire shots. The kinetic movement of the camera flawlessly matches the energy of the scenes it depicts. This is the West as you've never seen it before.

Depicting Johnson County War, a rarely-acknowledged tragedy of American history, Heaven's Gate is uncompromising in its portrayal of brutal violence and shameful corruption. The story is ultimately bleak, but presents the full range of human emotion throughout its run time.

Heaven's Gate is big in just about every possible way. How many extras hired, how many costumes sewn, how many horses used, how many buildings erected, how many languages spoken, how many days were spent making this film happen? Apparently enough to bankrupt United Artists, something for which this film lives in infamy. This bankrupting of the company, combined with the bleak story and the director's singular vision, resulted in the film's horrific reception. It was hacked down to two-thirds it's original length and subsequently crucified by critics. I can't imagine the film packing nearly as much power in such a shortened state. In its original, over three-hour form, however, Heaven's Gate stands tall among all epics of the cinema as the last of its kind, a neglected masterpiece gradually accumulating its due praise.


And here's what Olivier Assays wrote about Heaven's Gate on Criterion website:


I saw this one again a few weeks ago in its incredible restored directors cut. I have always admired Michael Cimino, and I loved Heavens Gate when it was releasedwith some quibbles. Now, I cant believe I could have had any quibble about this masterpiece. Its not just that it ages well; it wipes away any doubt: for some reason the passing of time (remember the only genuinely moving tagline ever? What one loves in life are things that fade.) reveals this film as the extraordinary, transcendent triumph I could not see then. And the way it finally reaches us through the echo of time only makes it more moving, heartbreaking, even.


So yes, definitely watched as soon as possible. I recommend it to everyone, but especially for someone who likes McCabe and Mrs. Miller.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't love it because of technical breakthroughs or historical importance. I love it because:

- Beautiful cinematography.

- Subtle yet powerful score by Bernard Hermann

- Amazing performances, especially by Orson Welles. And maybe the best make-up work I've ever seen. Puts all the CGI agings in recent films shame.

- Great screenplay with memorable dialogue.

- Some of the most organic non-linear storytelling I've ever seen. Only film I've seen that surpasses Kane in this regard is Once Upon a Time in America.

- And all the little touches like image of Kane's sled alone in the snow that still haunts me to this day

- And it's a film that has something to say about life. The most subversive aspect of Citizen Kane, in 1941 and now-because it is still relevant thematically and still devastating in its implications-is the dark light it throws on fame, success, wealth, and the heritage of plutocracy. 

- And most importantly, it always hits me emotionally no matter how many times I see it. I am just baffled when I see that (at least in Reddit) there seems to be this very common narrative that Citizen Kane is just cold technical showmanship that can be only appreciated as part of film history. It couldn't be farther from the truth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is that studios get only around 25% of Box Office gross from China, when they get 50% from domestic markets. And they can only release very limited amount of China. If these two things don't change, I can't see China becoming equal to domestic markets (or even Europe) in Box Office importance. 

Hopefully China will politically/culturally become more "westernized" (I mean at least to degree to a places like Japan), so that American (or other non-chinese) films can play there with same rules than they do in the majority of rest of the world, then China might become really important player. Especially if they become more and more prosperous with wealthy middle class.  I have no idea if that's something that might happen though.

<TITLE> Let's discuss Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 (Novecento) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-14 22:52:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yesterday I watched it for the first time and even though it's over 5 hours long it went by pretty fast. I am not really sure what to think about it. There is real greatness there but at the same time it's clearly flawed too.

First I have to say that [the opening shot of the film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBo3rN6Z1M) is really stunning. Slow zoom out of the painting while Morricone's  Romanzo rises in tempo really puts you into mindset of seeing true epic.

There's gonna be some spoilers below so if you haven't yet watched the film I suggest you do so.

I really liked the first part of the film, and I was really anxious to see the rest when intermission started. If second part would have been as great 1900 would be one of the greatest films ever made. But I gotta say that second part was slight disappointment. I felt like first part of the film really laid groundwork for epic confrontation between workers and fascists/landowners, but then it really never happened. Suddenly fascist were in power and there were some random terror mainly by Sutherland's Attila and suddenly it was liberation day. It's 5 hours film but still it felt like there wasn't enough stuff in it somehow. 

And it was also really dissapointing that Stefania Sandrelli's character was killed off-screen during intermission. She was one of my favourite characters and I would have wanted to see more about her.  Or at least give her more sentimental send-off. 

I didn't really like ending either, it just felt too surreal for this type of film.

Some people criticize this film for being basically propaganda. There's some truth to that especially towards ending, but that didn't really bother me at all. I mean after all most of Einsenstein's films are blatant propaganda and nobody let that diminish their appreciation of his films, so I don't think that it should diminish anyone's appreciation of 1900 either. And while it might be little bit simplistic in it's politics, I think that it's also portrays quite realistically what  life probably was at that time in Italy.

All in all I think that it's a great film that every film buff should see. But it's one of those films  thats are so good that you start getting mad at it for not being great. I just felt that there was potential for being one of the greatest epic films ever made somewhere there but the second part of the film didn't really deliver.

So what are your thoughts about this film? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great analysis. I agree basically with everything you wrote and I've been meaning to write similar post for sometime, so thanks for doing this so I don't have to.

  It seems like it is not as appreciated as other classic movies and to be honest it does't make a great first impression. I really believe that if you have seen The Searchers once, you haven't really seen it.

This was my experience as well. When I first watched it I liked it, but it didn't make that big impression. But then I rewatched it sometime ago and it immediately became one of my all-time favourites. Although it might have been that my first impression was what it was because I was relatively young when I first saw it. If I would watch it first time now I probably would appreciate it more from the get go.

The biggest knock on the film is the dramatic shifts in tone and questionable attempts at humor. I have grown to enjoy the comedic elements of the movie over time but I do understand this complaint. 

This was my biggest complain when I first watched it. Like you said it's shockingly dark western from 50s and then there is "arrow to the butt" type of humour in the mix.  But like you, I've come to appreciate that part of it more as well so it doesn't really bother me anymore.


 This movie alone made me a John Wayne fan, as I think he gives one of the greatest performances ever. Again, there is a ton that is almost impossible to notice on a first viewing, but Wayne's facial expressions tell the real story of the movie. Look at his scenes early in the film with his brother's wife, Martha. Not a word is spoken about it, but the looks and gestures of these two characters indicates an intense longing and passionate history between them, it's incredible how just a few minutes and no exposition can show this.

The Searchers truly is more subtle film than most people realize and it's made to be seen on the big screen. Modern audiences have been so used to exposition trough dialogue that they probably miss lot of the stuff on the film like the relationship between Ethan and Martha that you mentioned. 

Peter Bogdanovich has really great commentary track for The Searchers that's on Blu-ray/DVD that I recommend for anyone who wants to learn more about the film. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Reminds me a lot of the cowboy movies back in the day. They were insanely popular for a few years and then people just got sick of the same thing over and over.

I am not sure why you think that westerns were only popular for couple of years. That's definitely not true. Westerns were the most popular genre for many decades. 

And economics of making westerns back in the day vs superhero blockbusters these days couldn't be more different so I am always baffled when people compare these two genres.

But I agree with you that superhero movies have probably already peaked. At least I hope so.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Without a doubt, Michael Cimino's 'Heaven's Gate'.

It's an American epic on a scale not seen before or since, or likely ever again, Heaven's Gate is an unfairly maligned masterpiece. Running a colossal 219 minutes, the film is bursting with spectacular visuals, impressive technical work, and a collection of great performances from the likes of Kris Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert, Christopher Walken, and Jeff Bridges.

This film look absolutely stunning. Cimino makes use of light, shadows, dust, and smoke to create some of the most gorgeous shots ever put to film. Sunlight pokes through shutters, windows, and the tops of trees to cast beautiful streams of light across the frame. Clouds roll in, casting everything in shadow before moving on. Dust kicked up by horses and carriages swirls across the landscapes. Smoke billowing off trains, homes, and buildings engulf entire shots. The kinetic movement of the camera flawlessly matches the energy of the scenes it depicts. This is the West as you've never seen it before.


Depicting Johnson County War, a rarely-acknowledged tragedy of American history, Heaven's Gate is uncompromising in its portrayal of brutal violence and shameful corruption. The story is ultimately bleak, but presents the full range of human emotion throughout its run time.

Heaven's Gate is big in just about every possible way. How many extras hired, how many costumes sewn, how many horses used, how many buildings erected, how many languages spoken, how many days were spent making this film happen? Apparently enough to bankrupt United Artists, something for which this film lives in infamy. This bankrupting of the company, combined with the bleak story and the director's singular vision, resulted in the film's horrific reception. It was hacked down to two-thirds it's original length and subsequently crucified by critics. I can't imagine the film packing nearly as much power in such a shortened state. In its original, over three-hour form, however, Heaven's Gate stands tall among all epics of the cinema as the last of its kind, a neglected masterpiece gradually accumulating its due praise.


Edit: And honorary mention to Sergio Leone's final masterpiece 'Once Upon a Time in America'. People always talk about his westerns but I think that 'America' is his real masterpiece (or at least it ties with 'West'). It seems that even people who love Leone's westerns haven't often seen this masterpiece. Which is sad because I think that it might be even better than The Godfather.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Lets discuss Sergio Leone's final masterpiece 'Once Upon A Time In America' </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-07 15:02:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just rewatched the 229 minutes version for third time and I am even more impressed than I was before. This film is so criminally underseen. I never see it mentioned here, even though Leone is quite popular director on this subreddit. I honestly believe that this might be greatest gangster film ever made. 

Everything about this film is so great. Set design is immaculate, time periods can truly be felt.And I've never seen non-linear storytelling done so organically. Usually when movies play with linearity it feels like gimmick but here it really works. And I think that Morricone has never been better than in this film (Although 'Once Upon A Time in the West' certainly is great contender'). [Deborah's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuyYc0gINbU) is my personally favourite.

I have to quote one Letterboxd review of this film that I agree.

 People say that Leone must have been crazy to have turned down directing The Godfather to have made this film. I would never say such a thing. Heres what I believe to be true: in maybe fifty years, people will credit Once Upon a Time in America higher than they will credit The Godfather. It will take time - but I honestly believe it will happen. This film is not perfect. No. I dont consider any film to be perfect. But I think this is the closest any American film has ever come to the subjective concept of perfection. Well, as Noodles would say thats how I see things.


So what do you think? Lets discuss this film. And if you haven't seen it, you should immediately watch it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see The Third Man being praised a lot in this subreddit (and for a good reason), but I don't see much of mentioning of Reed's other post-war masterpiece in Criterion Collection, Odd Man Out.

I just watched it first time because I read that it's one of Roman Polanski's favourite movies and one of the reasons why he became filmmaker. And I got to say that I might liked it even better than The Third Man (which I also like a lot)

So if you haven't seen it, you should. </TEXT>

The Big Heat is definitely American film. And big part of classical American Noir films were made by European emigres like Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang and Robert Siodmak etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Of course I'm serious, he was well known in the movie buff crowd but regular people didn't go see his movies based on the strength of his name until after Titanic.

That's just simply not true. Cameron's films have never been just for movie buff crowd and he has been regularly in prime time talks shows like Letterman since 1980s and often interviewed in mainstream magazines like New York Times etc. 

Of course directors aren't most often as famous as biggest movie stars with the exceptions of people like Hitchcock, Polanski or Spielberg (and arguably James Cameron), but when compared to other filmmakers James Cameron has been quite well-known since mid-80s and household name since 90s.  Compare that to Villeneuve who is already 6 years older than Cameron was when Titanic was released and yet he has virtually unknown to general public. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  General public didn't know Cameron before Titanic

You can't be serious. He was absolutely one of the best known directors in the world even before making Titanic. I mean both T2 and True Lies were both most expensive movies ever made at the time and T2 was highest grossing movie of the year. And The Terminator, Aliens and Abyss were not exactly low-profile either.

<TEXT>  I was just saying that studios love those three because they can make money back on their projects

You can't even speak about Villeneuve in same sentence with Cameron and Nolan when it comes to profits of their movies. Cameron has literally made two of the highest grossing movies in the history and Nolan's 4 last films have average Box Office Gross of about $900 million.

 $80 million return.

Box Office Gross  return. Studios get on average 50% of domestic gross and on average 39% of foreign gross. And that $30 mil budget was only for production, who knows how much they used for marketing.  I am not saying it was flop or anything and at the end of the day it probably made nice profit for a film like that but it's not like studios are rushing to produce anything from Villeneuve which is absolutely the case with Nolan and Cameron. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think there are two main reasons this happens (though there are probably more). The first is that you may not have been the right age, or in the state of mind, or interested in concepts/techniques that the film explores the first time you watched it.

For me it's probably been more about life experiences, not about the film techniques etc. I've studied cinema from so young age that by the time I was in high school I had more knowledge of the history of cinema than probably most of people graduating from film school. But what I lacked was life experiences and I think that life lived changes how we see films. 

But then there are films like Chinatown where I rewatched it quite soon after first watch (in a less than year) and yet I appreciated it far more on rewatch. Maybe I just picked more details.  </TEXT>

I was just wondering is it just me or does anyone else have similar experiences where they don't appreciate movie on first watch but later realize that it's a truly great movie? </TEXT>
