<TEXT> I came into my office early to get some work done. I heard my coworker, that works in my department, at her cubical and had a question to ask. She was the only other one in and had no idea anyone else was. I walk over to discover her editing pornographic images of herself. I saw her on all fours, from behind, spreading her pussy lips. It was super embarrassing...But cool as hell. An hour later we went for a smoke and laughed it off.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After a year of duty, my company shut down a number of offices and I have subsequently lost my position. 

They have offered a two week notice, two week severance package.

-Is that enough?
-What should I do next?
-There is an expired date on the initial severance contract (Friday) what does that mean for me if I don't sign?

Any other advice would be great. I know others in the industry have taken months to acquire a new position...

<TEXT> Poo roulette. 
I was out with my, relatively new, girlfriend and her mates. After a night of heavy pre-drinking we made our way to a bar. As soon as we left my stomach was churning. I had recently become addicted to hot sauce and burritos which weren't helping. I knew I made a mistake of not relieving myself at the house. 

At the bar, I do a great job loosening pressure with some well placed farts and many urinal visits. Two urinals and a toilet that was a single stall which was always full and completely covered in piss and shit. I was fearful of exploring that route. 

On our way out I make everyone wait for me at the front while I release some urine induced pressure. During, I fight to rid of a stubborn fart. Red faced I unleash a huge wet shit right into my underwear. I can only assume the guy beside me heard and smelt this which caused him to evacuate. I waddled to the stall, praying no one else came in, ripped off my undies and slammed dunked 'em in the trash. 

Any of the earlier stinks I had laid could have been the bullet in my game of poop roulette.

I walk out with one layer of separation and no one the wiser. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the great, detailed response.

I lived there for the entire time - 1 year, roughly.

One important detail - we broke our 3 year mortgage and paid a hefty penalty.

<TEXT> You and your friend made a business deal (split everything).
Reply: So purchasing a home with someone because we couldn't do so separately means this is a business purchase? 

Invested (bought a house and did reno's).
Reply: Many people do this for both business and non-business.

Sold the investment for a profit ("we made a little money").
Reply: Many people sell their homes and make a profit on them, so that point doesn't hold much weight.

I'm not really seeing your points here. You're just assuming. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The CRA is claiming I didn't live in my home and used it for business purposes. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-12 15:04:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A friend and I purchased a house a few years back with plans only to live and slowly renovate. Everything was split down the middle and we renovated the entire basement in the first year. 

Shortly after, I decided I'd like to sell the house and move closer to work as my commute was taking a toll. Sale completes, we make a little money and we move on. I rent for 3 years and then decide to buy again. 

Now the CRA is claiming we worked together in a business manner and should have taxed our earnings as such.

In their initial investigation I worked with and provided them with various information...really just asking if this was my intent and if I lived there for the duration. We also submitted a letter from our cable provider stating we received service for that time. 

Shortly after I receive a notice claiming I am guilty of negligent tax submission and have to pay a large sum. 

I lived in this house for the entire time as my primary address. Of course people buy houses, renovate and expect a return at some point, but in this case it was a faster than expected turn around. 

Has anyone ran into this issue and have any advice to share? Seems like I'm guilty before proven innocent here... </TEXT>
