<TEXT> This is obviously an advertising article for EndTest: Look at the medium posting history of the author. He is writing articles about web development, where he is linking and recommending this product in nearly all of them (Most hilarious one: "The 10 Most Common Mistakes Web Developers Make" - mistake 4: you don't use EndTest).



If you read this linked article, it becomes pretty obvious. Also, take a look at the posting history of his reddit user. I recommend to downvote or delete this thread. </TEXT>

I think this is where the banks are digging their graves right now: It's ok to follow the law for blocking transactions and be transparent about it, but totally not ok to make up own random rules and refusing to tell me about them. 



I can only recommend to switch the bank as soon as possible, since if they start with this bullshit, they will continue with this in other areas as well. </TEXT>

From my experience, the market for game development tools, especially engines is getting more difficult each day. And more saturated. And you dont earn a lot any more, people now expect mostly everything  to be free.

And browsers still behave differently. And even if it is the same browser, it will behave differently depending on the operating system, device, screen, and so on.

For a bit easier start, try some older 3D engine like Ogre or Irrlicht. Those are a bit more high level, but you still learn very much by using them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just released the game 'PostCollapse' on steam. Redditors from this sub helped me with their feedback so far, some even supported the development with money (big thanks!). I try to create a game which is entertaining but a bit more realistic (no zombies etc). Which is difficult, because the life after collapse isn't actually fun at all. Actually it is rather boring, to be honest.

The game is "early access", that means it is not final and will be improved and tweaked. So any feedback is welcome. Is there something which could be added? Any suggestions, ideas?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm the main developer of the [CopperCube 3D Game Engine](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube). Yesterday, I [started a poll on twitter](https://twitter.com/Ambiera/status/709314281062469632), asking which of the following 3 features people would like to have the most in a (probably even free) upcoming update of CopperCube:

 
 nbsp;
 

* Linux support (Editor AND games)
* Open VR support (HTC Vive etc)
* Modern 3D Renderer (DirectX 12 and/or Vulkan)


 nbsp;




So far, most people seem to be interested in a more modern 3D renderer, and I'm surprised that there isn't much more need for Linux support (especially, because this would also mean for example Steam Machine support for your games). 

To get more people vote on this, I'm posting this here on r/gamedev, maybe you could also vote what you would like to see in our small 3D game engine. Also, any feedback or comment is also much appreciated. You can [vote here directly on twitter](https://twitter.com/Ambiera/status/709314281062469632)


 nbsp;


*Note that this is just a poll. I'd like to see how much interest is there for each of these features. This doesn't mean that any of those features will be implemented. But yes, of course, it is likely that some of those will.* </TEXT>

<TITLE> CopperCube Game Engine 5.4 released </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-17 08:29:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We just released [CopperCube Game Engine](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/) version 5.4. It is a free update. Also available [on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/364970).  


 nbsp;

New features include:

* Heightmap import support for terrain
* Integrated Texture Packer
* Much smaller, compressed files for WebGL
* Much smoother first person shooter style camera
* Full web page WebGL support
* Footstep sounds
* Box testing for "On proximity do something" action
* Nicer 2D image drawing
* New "Recalculate normals" command
* Possibility to update static Phyics geometry
* Pan support for Model Viewer Camera
* Improved .OBJ file loader
* Increased WebGL performance
  
Read a [detailed change log here](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/changelog.html).  


 nbsp;


If you haven't heard of CopperCube yet: Several users described it to me as a very simple version of Unity with excellent WebGL support. I never used Unity myself, so I cannot say if this is true, but since this is what I've been told multiple times, I think it could give you a good idea. Have a look at it, if you like, [on its website](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/). Also, feedback and questions are always welcome! (I'm the main developer, so feel free to ask anything)

<TEXT> I also wrote a webgl library, and doing it like that. Use a second canvas, draw your UI stuff and then copy that into a texture. Works nicely and is quite fast. No significant performance lost.


However, I'm not sure if this is necessary at all. For the game I am currently working on, I noticed that it is easier to just use HTML/CSS directly for the UI. It is ideal for this, so probably not even necessary to integrate UI into your webgl engine. </TEXT>

But still, there were more than a handful successful games created with it. Current best example is Minetest, todays most popular Minecraft clone. Or Octodad. Or Galactic Dream. See a list of more for example on the wikipedia.


Now take a look at most of the other suggested open source 3d engines in this thread, and see if you can find as much finished games with those. </TEXT>

It is easy, and can be done, but because it is the first time you are doing that, all the tools are probably a bit overwhelming, and you would probably need a bit of time for this. I think depending of you understand the programming language / framework already via code academy, making a full app from that and putting it into the app store will take something between 5 and 20 work days.

And I created about 10 small ones ages ago, when the term 'Shareware' was hip :). For other recent games I only worked as contract programmer, so I only observed how marketing was done there, and didn't do it myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I meant is that you can market and sell an expensive app more easily. If it costs you about 6 euros to get a visitor to your website which downloads and tries your app, and then even decides to buy it, that's good, if your app costs 30 euro. Not so if it is just 1 euro, then you have a problem. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tips for Starting your own GameDev Business in 2016 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-02 10:23:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Because this question comes up on my blog frequently, I wrote down a [blog post about how I am making money by creating software / games](http://www.subject46403d.org/pivot/entry.php?id=1483). While writing and editing, the text has become more a list of tips on what to do, in order to make money by developing software or games.

 nbsp;

**Disclaimer**
I do not only create games, but mostly general purpose software, including gamedev tools. Of which one [even made it to Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/364970), if that makes it any better. But the rules are the same. 

 nbsp;

**Summary**

* Developing your game is only 50% of the work. Marketing and sales are at least the same amount of work. 
* You are not likely to create a superstar app, like Minecraft. Plan for that, and you still can be successful.
* Be prepared to fail: It is likely that you won't make any money. Don't be surprised if you do.
* Charge a sustainable amount of money for your software: You won't be able to live from an app which costs only 1 euro. You are a programmer, do the math yourself.
* Use a real payment processor: I suggest not to use paypal. There are better and more safer ones out there. And they don't necessarily cost much more.
* Do your own marketing: Don't just set up a twitter account and hope for the best. Today, with all the amount of games out there, you need to do active marketing, even with 0 budget.

 nbsp;

**That's it**
For some people, all this probably wasn't worth mentioning at all, but I was surprised for how many this short list of tips could actually useful. See the [full blog post](http://www.subject46403d.org/pivot/entry.php?id=1483) for details. Hope this helps someone!

<TITLE> Chrome 47 being slow for WebGL? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-19 13:19:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi,
 I'm working on a WebGL game, and noticed that since Chrome updated to version 47, it has become quite slow. Does anyone have a similar problem?


Details: After my game has generated a big enough world (everyting is procedurally generated), it will nearly freeze, dropping to a frame rate of about one frame per 5 seconds. I made a lot of tests, and I'm pretty certain this is likely caused by Chrome's garbage collector (or something related), which now kicks in more aggressively once your used memory has reached a certain threshold. 

 It works nice for all other browsers like Firefox and older Chrome versions. Interestingly, even Microsoft's Edge browser works nicely with the game, and surprisingly, even IE is faster than Chrome 47 now.

Already reported the problem, but didn't hear back from Google. You can reproduce the issue here: [start the game](http://www.endtime.at), walk 600 meters and turn your head around quickly. 


Anybody had a similar issue with their project?



**Update** This problem has been fixed. In case someone has a similar problem: I'm still unsure what was causing this, but I moved my code to use requestAnimationFrame() instead of setInterval(), and now it is also smooth on Chrome. Strange. Thanks for the feedback in here!

<TEXT> You got upvoted for this comment, but it is clear that you never developed, produced, marketed and sold a successful app entirely by yourself. If you are an indie developer, you need to have a way to contact your customers and be able to do paid upgrades, in order to survive. The Mac App Store prevents this, which is the main criticism of the dev of sketchapp.

If you want only huge corporations create software for Mac OS X, then go on like this. You likely work for one of them already. </TEXT>

If you write plain JavaScript yourself, and use the canvas directly, you'll learn the most generic functionality there is. It isn't even that difficult, Canvas/JavaScript is quite high level already anyway. I wrote quite a few web games myself, and did it that way. Learned a lot of stuff which helps me understand how most of the frameworks do their work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get this question quite a lot recently. Short Answer:


* It is really easy to use. The editor is simple. And no programming is needed.
* CopperCube is really good with WebGL. Where Unity and Unreal produce a huge undebugable binary chunk, CopperCube just needs a 200 KB .js file which downloads and starts pretty much instantly. And is fast. And it's open source, hand written JavaScript, which you can easily extend yourself, if you want.
* No bullshit hidden licensing, royalties or similar. Buy CopperCube once and create and sell as much games as you want.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi r/gamedev,


[CopperCube Game Engine](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/) version 5.3 has just been released.  


*If you never heard of CopperCube: It is a tiny but powerful 3D game engine. Like if Unreal is Google, then CopperCube is DuckDuckGo. CopperCube is pretty nice for WebGL (but does also lots of other platforms), and quite easy to use.*


 New features are:
 
 
* Fog rendering
* Greatly Improved Blender file loader
* Experimental .FBX file import
* Android source code (for pro edition users)
* Performance improvements
* More fine grained sound control
* WebGL pinch detection and dynamic scene loading
* Spanish translation
* New scripting functions
* "Load new mesh from disk..." command
* And lots of other small changes


Details of the changes are [listed here](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/changelog.html). 

CopperCube Basic Edition is also currently is -50% off. [Also on steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/364970). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nice to hear that it worked nicely on the iPad too. I didn't think about support for this, but it was created using CopperLicht which includes support for mobiles. Adding a control for movement on touch devices is just about a line of code, I will do that for the next update. Thanks for the feedback! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help us translating the CopperCube 3D game editor </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-24 05:45:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi,

 it is pretty hard finding people who know game development jargon, and are translators, so I decided to made the translation of the CopperCube 3D editor a community effort. Help us translating the editor, and **you'll get a free CopperCube Professional license, worth 380 euro** as thank-you.  
  
  
So far, we already have translations for Russian, Turkish, German and English. Doing this is pretty easy, but probably a bit of work: There are about 950 strings in the editor (yes, that beast has a lot of features :) ).  
   
  
If you want to help, see [this thread with the details in the CopperCube forum](http://www.ambiera.com/forum.php?t=3889).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The game editor is now available in version 5.2. From the change log:

 Realistic Realtime Water  
 Added realtime reflecting water surfaces. There is now a special scene node which renders water surfaces and can be used to create rivers, lakes, and oceans. It is highly configurable, so it can be used to create various, realistic looking water surfaces. It works on all targets (Windows, Mac OS X, WebGL, Flash and Android)  
  
Procedural Tree Generator  
 There is now an interactive tree generation user interface for creating procedural generated 3D trees  
  
 Lots of smaller changes:  
 - DPAD support on Android  
 - updated and modernized user interface  
 - new prefabs  
 - 21 day trial (instead of 14 before)  
 - Localization (German and English for now)  
 and more  
  
[Details with screenshots](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/changelog.html)  
  
The WebGL backend also has been made open source recently, so this is also useful for programmers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,
 we just made [CopperLicht](http://www.ambiera.com/copperlicht/) - our WebGL 3D engine - free and open source for everyone. If you are planning a HTML5 3D game, maybe this could be interesting for you.


If you ever tried [Irrlicht](http://subject4640.sourceforge.net/), you'll notice that its API is very similar to it, that's because I also wrote that 3D engine originally. 


CopperLicht was originally the WebGL renderer backend for out 3D game editor [CopperCube](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/), so it is quite capable of doing a lot of interesting stuff.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask in here!

You can download the library including its source from its [website](http://www.ambiera.com/copperlicht/) , and use it for every project you like to. </TEXT>

<TITLE> CopperCube 5 released </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-02 09:10:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi,
 I just released version 5 of the 3D game engine/editor I am working on, [CopperCube](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/). There are a lot of new features in this release, like:

* Terrain support, including own terrain editor
* Physics engine for the native targets - Windows .exe and Mac OS X .app
* Video Playback in 2D and 3D - supported for the targets Windows .exe, WebGL, and Flash
* Network communication - scripting support for communication with your own servers and databases
* iOS 8 WebGL support - apps created with CopperCube and the WebGL target now also run on Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, ...) with iOS 8.
* Shader programming - possibility to create own materials during runtime using JavaScript
* Animation blending
* Attaching nodes to animated meshes - useful for example to let characters carry weapons in their hands
* Directional light - both supported by the light mapper and dynamic lighting
* Procedurally generated trees - generates trees (3d model of plants) based on user specified parameters
* Faster Lightmapper, with Mac OS X support - The built-in lightmapper has been rewritten and is now much faster
* Optimized WebGL performance and compatibility
* Custom Icons for Windows Apps
* Possibility to send commands to the AI
* 15 new prefabs
* and a lot more

CopperCube is a nice tool for people who don't want to us programming for creating games, but it's scripting features are also getting better and better. More info about this release can be found on [its website](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/).

Working on the new release of the 3D game editor, not a game, but very gamedev heavy.
About 95% of the work is done, so I hope the new release will be soon. This week I worked on the improved light mapper, character animation and AI refinements. You can see some of these minor new features I've added in the demo below.

<TEXT> I wrote a game engine which is similar to Unity (as I've been told, I never tried unity myself) and is named [CopperCube](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/), it has quite some features already. I started with [subject4640](http://subject4640.sourceforge.net/) as base framework, and extended it from there. Irrlicht is C++ and not C#, but the code is very friendly to extend and getting used to, so I'd say it would be possible. Definately interesting work, but it is also a lot of work. :)

<TEXT> Zombies would really be the obvious choice for this type of game, right. :) It's planned more as simulator game, but since everyone loves Zombies (including me), I'm thinking about adding a selection of apocalypse scenarios to be chosen from in the beginning, including probably also zombies. :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> **EndTime at Home**

Working on this game for only a few weeks now, and just released a tech demo last week. It's a post-apocalyptic simulator game, implemented in HTML 5 (using WebGL), and happens in a huge, entirely procedural generated world. The basics of the world generation engine are implemented, and it already creates simple terrain, trees, houses and streets.

<TEXT> Recently, I get a lot of game press releases wrongly submitted to [gamedevnews.com](http://www.gamedevnews.net/). And they have horrible, horrible content, so I wrote a short blog post about what to pay attention to when promoting your game using a press release here: [Some tips for promoting your game using a Press Release](http://www.subject46403d.org/pivot/entry.php?id=1394)

Very basic tips, but Might be useful.

It's not that bad actually once you wrote a wrapper for unifying the API calls a bit. iOS: Planned, but not sure when. JS in Flash: I first thought about porting one of the JavaScript VMs to Actionscript, but actually, you can just use the VM of the Browser where the flash app is running in easily in Flash, using the ExternalInterface API. </TEXT>

http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/

It is basically a editor for easily clicking together 3D games without programming. But it is also possible to extend it with own JavaScript and Actionscript 3 code. 

It currently can create Windows .exe, Mac OS X .app, Flash .swf and WebGL .html apps, and with the just released version it also now creates Androids .apks.

I'm curious about your feedback, what do you think about this tool? Anything missing? Does it suck? Any feature requests, ideas or wishes? :) </TEXT>

If you kill the banks, there will be other banks, playing the middle man. The fact that the money they are giving out is now mostly coming from states and is 'printed' is another, sad story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> well, not really. You can also place 'layout containers', everything inside them then is relative to each other. Makes it simple to create absolute layouts but also gives the possibility to do dynamically sized stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is done using Adobe Alchemy (http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/alchemy/). Basically, you recompile it using the alchemy compiler which compiles C or C++ code into Actionscript 3 bytecode for the Flash VM. Recompiling is not the only thing, you have of course deal with some of the changes like resource loading, input handling and write a bit of code for this, but it's not that much work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> that's just a moving 2d texture clipped by a circle, no 3d in there. Look at the border of the sphere, the texture doesn't get skewed at all. I wouldn't call this 3D, and it's running impressively slow for such a simple effect. 

And I don't think that just because I'm using Opera? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Same happend to me as well (google terminating my adsense account and keeping all the remaining money without telling me why) and according to the amount of people coming to my blog by searching for things like "banned from google adsense" and similar, this seems to happen a lot.

But when this happened to me, they at least sent me a link to a webform where I could make them recheck teh account manually, and they unlocked the account again after some weeks. Maybe this guy simply overlooked this link?  </TEXT>
