<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's really hard to explain why;
1) The blue area around the crease doesn't really mean anything.

2) Fighting is allowed and celebrated. The  McCarron fight went on for ever, he said it was weird and scary for 20,000 people to so into it.

3) You can just jump on a guy and beat him and only he gets a penalty. Ex. The goalie interference call when Weber and Danault immediately jump on the Leaf player.

He also could never find the puck. It seems following the play is a skill. 
He enjoyed the game but got fed up with all the after the whistle stuff eventually. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How I feel about this game and all the controversy around it. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-07 17:02:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I love this game. Pure role playing at its finest. It look me about 50 games to learn it and another 100 to respect it. In those first 150 games I would leave if I didn't like the role, not write wills properly, not participate in the chat etc... Now however I do everything to make this games fun for everyone. Most importantly I play my role. Every role. I love them all (even disguiser). I find people get caught up in their abilities when everyone's most powerful tool is the chat. I love medium because it forces you to use your brain to help the town. Even if everyone leaves after dying you still have a the tools you need to help win the game and it's the exact same with disguiser. Some of my most enjoyable game have been as Medium. Finding other townies early then organizing things between other townies as I get info (ex. If I get jailed letting the Jailor know who I know are confirmed town are, letting someone know they can trust me ASAP in the game so they can rely on somebody. It really makes a difference. 
I find too many just want to do "cool" stuff or want the role to do all the work. People who leave GF, framer, Medium night 1 don't want to think or play the game. They just want to do cool stuff. 
I love and respect the game and Blankmediagames. I also have patience for those who don't, it just takes time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You make good points, I guess I was being overly critical. I agree with you about the suspensions.  However I think they're just trying to be honest. For example the Pacioretty/Chara hit (watch the video) If he immediately pops back to his feet it's not the sh*tstorm it turned out to be.  Although he didn't get any suspension and  I thought he was dead, so nevermind. I can't defend the NHL on this point.

<TEXT> First this has NOTHING to do with the John Scott situation. I think it's great. 

The All-Star game = joke (admittedly I don't have a solution to this one) 

The yearly awards = same people every year or deserving people overlooked *cough Babcock/Shea Weber* = joke

Hall of fame = everyone gets in = joke 

Coaching  = "old boys network" carousel  = joke

Referees = situational calls = joke

Fighting (for some not me)  = joke

Lockout/Strike every time the CBA is up = joke (get ready for 2020)

I love the game but there's a reason it's as  not popular as it should be. 

Go Habs Go! </TEXT>

<TITLE> I owe some of the greats of soul and R B a huge apology. Especially AL Green, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-11 02:20:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In my youth growing up in the 80's and 90's I thought I knew what good music was. I won"t embarrass myself by telling you what I thought( ahem.. Right Said Fred... ). At the time Al Green was that guy with Annie Lennox singing "Put a little love in your Heart" , Stevie Wonder was that blind guy who waved his head around and sang cheesy love songs and Marvin Gaye sang "Sexual Healing"  then was killed and then became famous because of those singing raisins. 
Last year I joined Spotify and I decided to look in to the history of modern music and my eyes were opened. For starters almost every rap song I loved growing up was sampled from a far superior 60's or 70's song. Even beats I thought were original turned out to be samples ( No diggitty I looking at you.) 
Al Green is remarkable talent with an amazing life story.
Marvin Gaye is my new favorite artist.  Fascinating life filled with ups and downs and the chemisty between Marvin and Tammi Terrell is something I wish I could have seen live in concert. Such A tragic end to promising career (research their history together it's worth it).
Stevie Wonder. I'm really sorry. I never took you seriously. I do now and I ask everyone to listen to his album Innervisions, it is the best single album of the era in my humble opinion. From beginning to end it really gives you feeling of what was happening at the time from a societal point of view.
Anyways with Spotify I am able to listen and discover many artist that i missed growing up. i only wish that I could go back in time and hear these artists in their prime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not saying that android is better. This isn't comparison post. It's simply my thoughts after a week with android. Lg g2 with mod camera is superior to my 4s and I have a the apps I need. Google integration is surprisingly useful. The point of my post is that I immediately thought " must jailbreak" upon putting hands on the phone. It wasn't as necessary as being on an iPhone.
Tl:dr; android is not better or worse. Just easier to customize in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thoughts from a long time iOS user who recently switched to Android. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-24 16:34:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Tl:Dr; made the switch immediately rooted. Realized that I was conditioned to by iOS. Didn't Need to root 90% of wanted "tweaks" available out of the box.

I'll probably get downloaded down to h*ll but here I go:)
I had a 4s with iOS 8.1.1. Jailbroken and tweaked to my liking. Recently I wanted to upgrade my phone. I didn't have the money to buy an iPhone 6 outright and I had a great plan that I didn't want to change so subsiding was out. I was looking for a used phone when came across the LG G2 32gb for a great price. It had a 5.2" screen but no ad slot. Being a Apple user I was used to not having expandable memory. I bought it and started my android journey. My first act was to research and root my phone, Which I did. After playing around I quickly realized that I could do most things out of the box. Themes, installing unsigned apps, changing fonts, system sounds, default apps, icon layout, having more than 4 dock icons, Plex, Chromecast mirroring, stock notifications manager was good and a few more things.
Apple had conditioned me to immediately jailbreak any phone I get. It wasn't necessary with this phone. I love iOS, its great. I gave my wife my new phone and she gave it back after about a minute saying "that's way too complicated for me" Which it was:) I appreciate the guided experience with iOS it's perfect for most people and I still recommend the iPhone to everyone however android is a power users dream.
I did keep root access so I could change the camera driver and to install xposed framework which is similar to Flex.
Anyways the post is just to share my thoughts, when the iPhone 6plus comes down in price I'll probably which back to iOS. Apple simply makes superior hardware. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched ceremony on YouTube because I missed it live. I saw that was 14mins long and I expected to watch some and skip through most of it. However I ended up watching every second of it. I read the comments below of people saying how moving it was and how it brought tears to their eyes and thought they were being dramatic. But when the moment of silence came it was so quiet and I could feel the emotion I found myself sitting their with tears rolling down my face. It was totally unexpected. 
It was so well done and Mr. Beliveau was such a great man that any sports fan should watch it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Goldeneye N64 still rocks!! </TITLE>

<TEXT> I recently brought out my N64 for my son because our Wii was broken.  Played some games and then Goldeneye. I had fun with him. Last night my brother and some friends came over and we played. Once we started we were hooked. Four 40ish old men yelling and arguing like kids ( one of them tried to use Oddjob, we all yelled "No" simultaneously.) We played until 1am.
It reminds of  the one gamer truth. 
A good game is a good game. 

Edit: A good game is a good game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, some of you are not understand this properly. My wife was mad because her son talking about killing and shooting people doesn't make her happy. I'd feel the same why if I came home and found my 6 year old daughter in full make-up and high heels. She is by no means a "bitch" or " my mother" 
She was mad, I understand why and accept it.  Bottom line is we're definitely going to play again, she'll get over it. 
P.S. Back in the day I remember by owned by a 4 year old kid. He was awesome :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU by letting my son play Goldeneye </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-19 17:35:51 </DATE>

<TEXT> My son is 5 years old and loves video games. We don't let him play often, only on weekends, because he gets carried away and he cries when he has to stop. (We understand that he's a kid..) We have a Wii but it's broken right now. He's been really good so last weekend I bust out my N64 for him to try. We play some Mario Tennis, F-Zero, Snowboard Kids and Conker's Bad Fur Day multiplayer. Now Conker's was borderline inappropriate but it was still "cartoony" so it was OK. 
Then I see Goldeneye. Those of you of a certain age know about Goldeneye, it was the COD of our time. Great memories were made ,4 people one screen... ahh the good old days. Anyway I decide to share this experience with my son. We play, we have hunting each other down with machine guns, proximity mines, grenades, sniper rifles. After about 20 mins we stop and put it a away.
My wife comes home from the store and my son runs up to her and tells her all about the new games I found. Of course his favorite is Goldeneye and he goes on and on about how we shot each other and blew up people and how is favorite gun is the gold one because it kills the fastest. 
My wife is listening, nodding , smiling but   she gives me the "look". 
Now I'm in the doghouse, no lovin' tonight ;) I know it was not appropriate for him but it was damn fun though. 

TL;DR: Played  N64 FPS Goldeneye with my too young 5 year old son. We had fun. He told Mom gory details. I'm in doghouse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I dislike the freemium model, I have played candy crush and have enjoyed it.  I know plenty of people who are definitely not "gamers" but have put many many hours into it without spending a time. These same people don't understand why I can put so much time in to FF3, Super Hexagon or Device 6. Personally I believe that freemium games = Adam Sandler movies, I get why people enjoy them and why  they make a lot of money.   </TEXT>
