<TEXT> Hey guys

Im making this thread because im just in a array of negative emotions. Im a 30 year old man ,who has a penchant for music and writing. I post on this music website forum and it spark interaction with various people. I met a online friend and we developed a relationship sort of long distance relationship.

The bad or rather sad thing is i lied to this friend because i felt inadequate in her eyes (i work a very very menial job and i still lived ith my parents). Oddly enough she accepted my situations. This made me like her more , however it was as if things got worse. 

I come from a strict household. My parents they are hard on me even at my age. hen i first met this girl they seemed happy but its started seeming like they didnt like her for whatever reason. 

before meeting this girl it felt like i didnt have a purpose, didnt feel like, didnt feel attractive, my self-esteem just was low. She motivated me, made me happy.

I was so caught up in my on feeling i forgot about her own and as she said self-absorbed. Mainly because it felt surreal and arbritary to me. I forgot important days New Years and Valentine Days was both disaster . I was mad at her on NY and i didnt take her calls and on V-Day, my mom ruin it (lets just say i didnt have my own phone and was using my mothers at the time).


Ive shared personal things with her i never shared with anybody. She got me to open up about my aspirations and it felt super good. Cause for once someone gave a damn. 

We started having verbal arguments and it lead to her asking for space, wish i gave her (although we were communicating not as frequent though). Recently, a situation happen where she was disrespected and i addressed the situation and the person who disrespected her. We started talking all over again and i just felt this attraction. She was at work and told me about a meeting . I told her okay, but she later text me and said she wasnt going to text me. 

I know i lied
I know i made mistakes
but i like her

Right now: it like im empty, she wont talk to me and i have no one to talk to. Its like i have no one at all, my parents at their age they dont give a damn. My father he is harder on me than what my mother is. 

*BTW im hope im making since with what im saying. </TEXT>

Here's the Cliff Notes all according to True Master...

True Master was charged with escape after his arrest. He claims that he was escorted by an officer through 4 different corridors and released. He went home and there were police patrolling outside of his house because they broke the door earlier to arrest him. He saw the police and they saw him. He left and came back and saw them again. When word got out that he had escaped, those officers rearrested him and put it in their report that he did not look like he was trying toflee. Later on, that police report was changed to say that he was seen trying to sneak back into his house by hopping a fence in to the back. Also, the video footage that would have shown whether he was released or if he escaped was mysteriously deleted and no longer exists.

His DNA, saliva or semen were never found on/in the woman. She claims he put his hand in her with KY and that must have acted like a glove preventing DNA from being left behind. It was never tested for KY by the prosecution. Once True Master was acquitted, he paid to have it tested and there was no KY found in the sample.

She claimed while she was fighting him off, he dropped a wine glass and it broke. They prosecution said that they never tested the glass for fingerprints. After he was aquitted, True Master paid to have the glass fingerprinted. Not only were his fingerprints not found on the broken glass, the independent lab found materials on the glass that proved the prosecution HAD tested the glass for fingerprints and when they didn't find his, they lied to cover it up.


The escape charge was thrown out and he was found not guilty of the sodomy charge (forcing her to blow him), but he could be retried for attempted rape (penetrating her vagina) and unlawful imprisonment charges because they were declared a mistrial because the jury was deadlocked and one of the jurors was going on vacation and couldn't serve any longer.

<DATE> 2017-02-24 18:21:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *sorry if it reads like im rambling im real upset*

Im a 30 yr old male and for the last couple of months, ive been in a situation with someone we'll call Dionne. I met Dionne online on a Internet forum. She spark my interest with her comments on various subjects and it lead to private PMs and eventually the exchange of phone numbers.

I found out she was living in Florida and me living in Louisiana. I've been in long - distance relationships before , but never like this.

We both develop a attraction - a sexual one as well. However i made a couple of mistakes. I'll explain

When we first started talking i lied to her and told her i was living on y own. Reason why is because in my own eyes i felt inadequate. Like i couldnt match up.  

She stayed

I had situations with her where i could always reach her cause of my phone and living in a area that is out of range.  However i found a way to communicate.

Recently my father came into some property and want to move us out of New Orleans. This lead to a sort of conflict. Also with my mom, being overprotective and interfering in our relationship. (I'll explain later) 

Guys she is incredible, beautiful , sweet, nurturing. She want to deal with me, it feels odd. 

I further dig myself a grave because i made a false accusation that lead to e and her not speaking on New Years and blowing her off. the one time i do in fact decide to try and be there my mom barges in and interferes, this lead to a argument with her and it lead to a argument with me mom.


Right now im deep in the friendzone but im trying everything to win her back. Just dont know what to do then i wake up to a text message from her that says:

"Today is bad   toxic. I'm angry:

-That I allowed myself to abandon my good judgement and get emotionally invested when the signs were clear not to. Now, I have to work to fix myself - mind   emotions...figure out why I thought this was OK to do to myself. 

-That you came into my life to give me more lies, disappointment, pain   confusion than to add kindness, companionship, joy   pleasure. More negative experiences than good. All for nothing. You knew what you had going on in your life.

-That you say you need a lot of time but still in contact. Go live your life. Time waits for no one. 

-Friends? 
A true friend in honest, loyal, trustworthy   caring. In hindsight, we weren't really friends when we were together but I'm conflicted now because I know that you as a platonic friend is highly valuable. That opportunity is in jeopardy now too.

-That you constantly pushed me away and rejected me and now you say you are fighting to win me back. Let me be. You don't want me and because of that I don't want you. I want peace of mind more."


im just sad, depressed, scared and angry that i let her down. i dont want her to go guys. what do i do?

<TEXT> British heavyweight sensation Anthony Joshua wants to see his American counterpart Deontay Wilder step his competition up.

Joshua (18-0, 18 KOs) turned professional less than four years ago, but will face future Hall of Famer Wladimir Klitschko in April.

Wilder (36-0, 35 KOs), whos been around nearly nine years, will face Gerald Washington in his next fight.

While Joshua kept it respectful, he made his feelings clear: the Gerald Washingtons of the world will no longer do.

Many boxing pundits, fairly or unfairly, agree. Wilder has been criticized for his level of opposition as hes ascended into the heavyweight hierarchy.

I think Wilder needs to fight better opposition, Joshua exclusively told Sky Sports. Washington is good, but hes up and coming still. It was a last minute call-up as well.

Wilder has been a professional for around eight to nine years and I want to see a bit more, and there is nothing wrong with that, said Joshua. Good luck against Washington, but I think the other contenders in the heavyweight division need challenging as well, so I think it would be good for Wilder to force these type of fights, rather than taking easy pickings.

<TEXT> DOPE FIEND FEAT. DEBUT OF 50 CENTS SON SET FOR WORLD PREMIERE AT NEWARK INTL FILM FESTIVAL
EURPUBLISHERSEPTEMBER 4, 2016

*Brooklyn, NY  Dope Vision, the production team behind the film, announces the official world premiere of its highly anticipated film  a slick and powerful piece that has both critics and film fans near-fiending for more.

Dope Fiend is scheduled to debut at the Inauguration season of the 2016 Newark International Film Festival, which will be held in Newark, New Jersey on September, 10th at 7pm.

The trailer and movie mark the onscreen debut of Marquise Jackson, the son of rap legend 50 Cent.

Dope Fiend tells an important story that shouldnt be forgotten, being based on true events, commented a spokesperson from the film. The gentrification of Brooklyn wasnt something as smooth and clean as many people would like to think or suggest, and the line between hero and villain in NYC is often a very surprising one. Dope Fiend delivers the brutal truth in these areas, while never losing track of the people caught up in the conspiracy and chaos, their friendships, betrayals and very real love. Were looking forward to the films release. We think its going to provoke some real thought and discussion, in addition to being very exciting and entertaining.
