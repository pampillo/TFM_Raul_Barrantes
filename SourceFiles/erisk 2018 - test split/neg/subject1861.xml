<TEXT> I wanted to roast some cherry tomatoes in the oven instead but they were out of stock, so had to make do with the usual tomato. It might not be enough meat for you but I was asking if anyone wanted to take some off my plate cause I was so full! (Someone else piled about 3 times more bacon than me onto their plate though, so there was enough food for seconds if you were worried). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi OP! I'm living away from my family (at Uni) so learning how to cook simple meals is a must. 


Quick Breakfast Ideas:
- Banana milkshake (banana + milk + sweetener like honey if you need it)

- Yoghurt with a bunch of fruits and nuts (e.g. avocado, pine nuts, chia, cherries, banana) and honey if you need a sweetener

- If you wanna bulk up during the weekends try making sausages, beans, eggs, toast, mushrooms and bacon by frying them separately. You can also make pancakes or French Toast which are very carb-loaded.


Lunch/Dinner ideas
- Fried rice (use spam/bacon and eggs, and day-old rice) 

- Cream based pasta with mushroom and chicken (this is a house favourite - fry up bacon and mushrooms, then use the drippings to make a sauce by adding double cream) 

- Potato salad: boil potatoes and eggs, cut and mix with mayo, bits of ham, olive oil, cherry tomatoes, etc. 

- Curry: buy instant curry packs (you can find them at regular/asian supermarkets but I like Japanese curry the best) - cut up some veggies and add the roux and water. Let boil and then reduce to a simmer for 20 min. Goes great with rice, pasta etc. You can store leftovers as well. 

- Olive oil based pasta (I add lemon juice, pepper, garlic and shrimp that is precooked) 

- Carbonara 

I don't have a cast iron skillet so I just put my steaks into bake mode for 15 mins at 200 degrees, creates a great medium-rare steak. You can pair it with blue cheese onion sauce, etc. or eat it as is. You can also put salmon in the oven along with some carbs (oven fries?) as well as pork tenderloin and chops. The oven is your best friend (if you're too lazy to pan fry stuff). 


If you want to use the frying pan, I'd suggest making some pan fried beef, fish, pork. If you want more oriental stuff oyako-don is really easy to make, as well as Chinese sesame chicken. 


I don't really have snacks but I do like a cup of hot chocolate. I do bake so I eat those from time to time (brownies, cookies can be done in an hour/ 1.5 hours easily). If you really want to carb-load you can try making bread as well but it's more time consuming. However, I do find that I'm more motivated to make food that tastes food (vs quick food) if I want to eat more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to say, it's much tastier than chicken and waffles (but also more expensive). I think it's mainly because (I went to have a look at the recipe book on Amazon) they cure and bake the duck in the oven (confit style) before they fry it so it makes for a much juicier meat. Also the egg they used was a duck egg - I never thought of putting a flakier salt on top of it (I'm guessing Maldon but I'm not sure) but it makes a real difference. I told my boyfriend after the meal that I was converting to duck eggs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Reddit, 


Sorry for the long post. 



Background: I come from an Asian household and am living abroad in the UK. I am not close to my godfather as I am to my immediate family. That being said, I don't talk to them on the phone regularly - I speak to my grandma on the phone maybe once a fortnight, and to my parents once every one or two months because I simply wasn't brought up to use the telephone as much. I don't even call my best friends (we just whatsapp and meet up when I'm back for the summer). In the UK I don't even get a phone plan, relying on top-ups for data instead.



2 years ago, I went for a short holiday stay with my godfather's friends X and Y (70s M,F) along with my cousin. They were nothing short of welcoming and I really enjoyed staying there. When I got back, I emailed them a few times but never called. I felt that this was going out of my way because I would never do that to my extended family (cousins etc - my family has never been close, maybe it's a cultural thing) but did it because my godfather said that he emails them a lot. My emails (to wish them well for the holidays, CNY, update them on my life etc) were never answered. 



The following year, my cousin told me over whatsapp that she was going to call to ask them if she could celebrate the holidays again with them. She invited me to join her and although I had other plans in mind, I didn't mind and said sure. My cousin had never called as well but after her talk with Y, she texted me to say that Y was extremely upset that I never called her, and said that I was ungrateful and that I was uninvited for Christmas. Thinking that it was not probably a good time to call, I emailed her to clarify, went on with my other plans and called after she had cooled down in a few months. 



This has led to a cooling between our relationships on both parts. We've talked on the phone once every two - three months but Y still remains cool. Throughout this time, X's health has been deteriorating due to cancer. I have not talked to X for the past 2 years because even if he did answer the phone, he would just pass it to his wife and did not seem to want to talk to me either. X is on his last days and my godfather has asked my cousin and/or I to be there at the funeral since he has a holiday planned (in SE Asia) and will not be able to make it during this period. Y has been distraught, and refuses to talk to me at all over the phone (I talked with her daughter instead to express my condolences).



I'm in a dilemma whether to go as I have to represent my family and my cousin may not be able to make it on some days. However: 


- I am nowhere as close to them as my cousin, have only met them once, and have been getting feelings of hostility from Y dragged over years.


- It clashes with the busiest time of the school year: this is my final year and I'm taking 7 modules in a block format, 6 hours per day with no rest days. If the funeral falls on a weekday, I'll have to miss at least 6 hours of the same module and won't be able to catch up with the rest of the module that's being taught the next day, not to mention upcoming group projects and assignments. Moreover it's a 5 hour round trip and train prices are around 100. I can try applying for college leave but doubt that will be of any use because they're not family or immediate family. 



I guess I'm confused as to what I should do but am afraid it will strain relationships once more. 



  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Family friend's funeral coming up soon, am expected to go, but his wife has been hostile to me and it's coming at an inconvenient time. What should I do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> DUCK GAME. This game is seriously underrated. My roommate back in college (2 years ago) got it on Steam and literally 6-8 of us would gather every night to play/spectate (it can host up to 4 players) and we would play from 11 pm - 5 am after exams. Every night. Our sleep cycle got so screwed up because of that game. I was upset that it doesn't support Mac and am eagerly anticipating the release on Switch. 

Highlights:

- you kill each other with weapons. Different weapons have different amounts of ammo. You can get creative with your weapons (will not say more to prevent spoilers)

- In the steam version, online play and creation of your own maps 

- There's a button dedicated to quacking.

There's some youtube videos of Duckgames if you'd like to check it out.

Edit: with regards to other games that I haven't tried out, I'm looking forward to Snake Pass, Yooka Laylee, Hollow Knight, ARMS, Splatoon 2 and the Indie game Flipping Death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Amazon's (UK) page now reads this: 

Amazon has sold out of our week 1 allocation of Nintendo Switch.

We are expecting to receive more stock in March. Customer orders will be fulfilled in the order they are placed. You will receive email confirmation once we have visibility of when youll receive your order. Stock may be available to purchase via 3rd party sellers.

You can now purchase it at a whopping 350 (encouraged by Amazon on my webpage). 

Anyone in Central London knows where to get a switch? All my local Argos are sold out and Toys R Us apparently "doesn't sell them". I'm pretty much out of luck until end Mar/April. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Living in central London, ordered in February from Amazon. Their delivery date was always 3 March, until 2:30 am this morning. I woke up at 6 to check my email and they sent me an email saying it had been "unexpectedly delayed" until Tuesday. Couldn't take time off work in time, and Toys-R-Us and Argos were completely wiped by lunchtime. If they had told me in advance I could've explored other options and that really pissed me off. They'll either deliver by Tuesday night (which doesn't work very well for me cause I go to Copenhagen on Wednesday and Thursday, and don't have a case to take the Switch with me) or will further delay it again (which wouldn't surprise me since I've zero trust in Amazon right now). Emailed Amazon, got a shitty 5 voucher. Never again. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My housemate [23/M] keeps using my scooter [21/F] every day </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-24 13:46:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi reddit,

One of my housemates [23/M] asked if he could borrow my scooter as he was late to college. 

I bought a scooter at the start of last year to ride to school. However, I found that the scooter placed more strain on my ankle and caused it to hurt badly whenever I needed to brake. This has led me to walk to college daily instead and to use my scooter recreationally (once every month or so) and when I'm running late to college (not often). 

I thought that him using the scooter was a one time thing, but he has started using my scooter every day to ride to college which makes me feel uncomfortable as it would wear the scooter down and when I wanted to use it this week, it wasn't there to my annoyance.

I have brought it up to him, but he brushes it off saying that "it's fine" and since I don't use it that often, it's okay if he uses it. I have suggested that he gets his own but he does not want to (he's not in financial difficulty at all). Any advice on what to do?

TLDR: Housemate uses my scooter every day, does not want to back off even when I tell him I don't feel comfortable with him using it every day. </TEXT>
