<TEXT> The thing that should truly scare everyone is that if the Steele dossier is accurate...the leverage the Russians have on Trump now just exponentially increased.

Even the smallest leak of corroborating information would bring down the Trump family empire.

You have to think at this point, what wouldn't Trump do in order to protect himself and his entire family. </TEXT>

Louise Mensch is getting her info directly from the intel community.

When it comes to her "insider" info, it's been pretty spot on. I mean she had the Carter Page FISA info in Nov of last year.

It's pretty obvious that she is being fed information by sources very high up in the intel community, and I've yet to see anything significant she's reported to turn out false. 

She's basically providing context/detail about the Steele dossier...both are constantly being proven to be accurate. </TEXT>

As a future warning, a lot of companies in the Webdev/hosting world use similar tactics...sign-ups for extremely cheap prices to upsell. Only to find out later (with no visible warning on their sites) that choosing a new plan negates all your "promo" benefits.

Cloudways is very similar with their "promo" credits. Siteground also will upsell with fairly deceptive language. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah Fox news is still very much in the tank for Trump and trying to discredit all of the Russian connection stories. 

Watched Fox for a minute last night and they had some "Russian expert" guest on. Both he and Tucker kept talking about how there's no real consensus that the email hack was done by the Russians and that Clapper cleared Trump of any involvement (neither are true).

He also laughably tried to assert that his expertise in studying Putin only confirmed how none of the of stories being published are true...because he knows how Putin operates and none of this is in character (LOL).

For people who only get their news from Fox...I wouldn't be surprised if they think that Trump was actually vindicated this week...thats pretty much how Fox is trying to portray the last week. </TEXT>

The Feds move really slowly and methodically on routine charges...now compound that normal process with trying to take down a President, who has a political party that controls Congress, and as Nunes has so clearly demonstrated....and will do pretty much anything to protect him....add to that an Attorney General who's openly lied about his involvement with the Russians as well.

You're going to see evidence laid out slowly and methodically piece by piece to be vetted and digested by the American public for weeks/months.

Rand Paul is as dishonest, and despicable as they come, he's just better at manipulating his image and playing the media (like his searching for the healthcare bill stunt).

It's hilarious to see people touting Rand Paul and his dad as "outsiders." Ron was a career politician, and yet he accomplished nothing and passed no meaningful legislation.

You're not buying that OP simply decided to abandon his sure fire way of making millions in order to develop a service that would teach others how to take over this sure fire business for him?

Instead of spending the last few months expanding this sure fire money making business to increase his revenue, he decided to start a SaaS business that would actually directly compete with his business model of selling Amazon Merch....

I mean it's pretty clear that he ISN'T trying to simply get his SaaS blog post to Rank 1 by stuffing this post with garbage image links every other line.....

OP is a natural teacher...a humanitarian...he clearly enjoys teaching others how to succeed more than making $$$$.

Also, don't be distracted by the fact that OP can't design a website that doesn't contain broken links....

I'm sure his ability to run a SaaS is completely independent from things like making sure the basics of his website works.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Siteground shared hosting was extremely slow in my experience. I had the growbig plan and load times were 3.5+ seconds consistently for months with minimal traffic as the site was brand new.

Spent some time looking up info on Reddit, reading Digital Ocean tutorials, Googling, etc. and set up my own stack (1 gig VPS on Digital Ocean)...

Now the exact same site/theme loads under 1s consistently. 

If you don't have the ability/desire to DIY (and I probably wouldn't with an ecommerce site), I'd look into a managed VPS (not Cloudways though). Sorry don't have anyone to recommend (other than skipping Cloudways) because after a very bad, brief experience with Cloudways i just decided to do it myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> GGG don't want to implement an AH because doing so will expose how rampant bots are....

Botting is far more rampant than the average player realizes, and I can only imagine that the addition of the Russian player base increased the numbers exponentially. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People should probably also be aware that /u/rm-rroot PMs pretty much every "noob" on here trying to sell them packages on his hosting provider under the guise of offering "help" via rocketchat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You guys are falling for GOP tactics 101.

Intentionally misusing a term in order to try and redefine it.

The more they can intentionally equate "voter suppression" to things that are OBVIOUSLY allowed, the less likely the public will be outraged in the future when legitimate instances do occur.

Whoever reported this article took the bait hook, line, and sinker. 

The result is that this will just be categorized by many as another example of the "media bias/dishonest media" based on the headline and the actual content of the article. </TEXT>
