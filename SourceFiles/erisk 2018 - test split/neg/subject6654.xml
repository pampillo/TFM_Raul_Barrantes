<TITLE> Our Sasquatch experience in Washington State. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 18:49:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 
Background- We're at an AirBnB in Washington State, not far from Mt Rainier National Park.


Our AirBnB host was outside on her horse pasture feeding her horse. We all went outside to greet her and thank her for accommodating us. She lived across the street, so she offered to show us her other property- with more horses and a few other farm animals. We pass her house and are now in her backyard. Our host, let's call her Michelle, gets us in a circle and whispers, "so, do you guys want to go back home with a story?". Intrigued, we say yes. And we had no idea what we were in for.


She takes us past one of her two barns and we walk into her wooded backyard along a foot trail that she takes her horses on daily. About 100 feet in, she stops us. "Look down", she says. We see what appears to be a foot print, yet wider and longer than that of a humans. It was especially long, so whoever left the print must have slipped in the mud- there were toe imprints as well.


She then begins to tell us that this imprint was made by none other than a Sasquatch.  While huddled around the imprint, she tells us how she got her house and then her second property across the street (our AirBnB). "You might think I'm crazy. But if I knew about their existence, I would have never had moved here. Do you want to see more?"


Of course we (a group of four 20-something year olds) do, so Michelle takes us further down the path. At this point, I was feeling a bit uncertain about what was coming or about to happen. Hair stood up on my arms and I got the chills. I kid you not- seconds later, Michelle says to us "Right about this point here is where you might feel some chills or your hair sticking up. She was spot on here, and I was feeling very uneasy about going forward. Yet, we walk a little bit further down the path.


"They had asked me to bring you guys here, they wanted to say hello.", Michelle told us. "I've never brought any of my guests back here before but it seemed important to show this to you guys."

We had no idea if we were going to see anything, as it was getting darker and darker out. We stop for some more conversation, when Michelle stopped us from talking. "Shh." We didn't hear anything. We're all still quiet, when Michelle asks us something peculiar- "Has any of you recently lost a brother? "Or have any of you ever experienced psychic abilities?" We all say no, it felt a little awkward and we moved on.


We go to the last point in our walk and she was astonished- she had laid some sticks down earlier in the day, and the arrangement of sticks had changed. "They're always mischievous and like to move things around to mess with us", Michelle explained. She also was saying how she left a deceased chicken right at that spot and it was gone- the Sasquatch people must have taken them. She said she often leaves them gifts (usually food) here, and they're gone before she knows it.


At this point, I'm feeling skeptical about all of this. I'm not a believer, but I also didn't have any reason *not* to believe any of this.


We were all quiet. Out of nowhere, we hear a noise far back into the woods. It sounded like an owl's hoot, but very, very far away. Michelle said, "Oh that's just an owl", but then she took it back when we heard the next noise. I can't recreate the noise in person, nor can I recreate it in my head, but I'll do my best do describe it. It sounded like a Monkey's "ooh ooh aah aah" mixed with the laugh of a hyena. Michelle assured us they meant no harm, and that was definitely them talking to us. She yells back in English to greet them, because they can understand our language as well.


We head back to the AirBnB and talk about nothing other than our experience for no less than 2 hours (while drinking, of course). I'm with my best friends and one of them makes it their mission to go back into the woods to search for the Squatch himself. The other one tags along, but I stay back because I didn't really want much to do with it. They leave, and I go grab a joint to smoke out on the deck. It was silent- nothing but me, the cabin, and the beautiful Washington State wilderness.


Then I heard it again. The same owl hoot in the distance, followed by the eerie sounding monkey noises. I was alone and stayed up another hour until my friends returned, and told them I had heard it again. Yet strangely, they didn't.


Before I went to bed, I googled something along the lines of "Washington state creepy laugh animal" and the first result was an article titled, "Bigfoot or animals? Hair raising sounds coming from a swamp on Indian reservation in Oregon". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi- I'm looking into options for keeping my front bumper safe from rock chips and always thought about a 3M Clear Bra, but what about a transparent plasti-dip job?  Is there a clear plasti-dip available to get the job done nicely, and is this a route you would take?  Or would you just bite the bullet and pay up to $500 for a real clear bra? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Transmissions are pretty solid.  In a way they're sorta meant to take a beating (regular use over a long period of time).  The first thing to do is to *not* think you're gonna ruin the tranny/clutch, because with that mindset you'll never learn the correct way to use it.  

As for going from 1st to 2nd...  just let off the clutch slowly and it shouldn't be jerky. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Driving from Seattle to Mt Rainier! Roads? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-02 17:42:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi All!  I'm visiting your beautiful state this week and will be renting a lodge in Randle, and am driving from Seattle.  I was hoping to take the 410 to 123 to 12 to get to Randle and drive right through the mountain pass to see some awesome sites, but Google Maps is saying that 410/ Mather Memorial Parkway is closed in the winter.  


My question is if the road is open yet at this time of year?  Not sure where WA draws the line between seasons as your winters are probably a bit more intense than mine on the east coast.


If the 410 is still closed, what are some other driving roads to check out with some great views?


Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sometimes cam with my iPhone, but from my experience it's best just to not cheap out and get a real dash cam.  Decent ones go for just $50.

The problem I have using my cell phone as a dash cam is that the lens isn't fish eye or wide.  So you only get a recording of what is right in front of you, not what's on your right or left. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Different career paths? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-02 14:35:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all, 


I've been working in Desktop Support for 3 years now and I always thought my career path would go something like Desktop Support - Server admin - Network admin (then possibly management, idk) , but lately I'm not too sure about it.  

My main problem really is dealing with the users.  At first I thought it wasn't too bad but lately it's just the same problems over and over again and I feel like I want to steer my career away from being end-user support as it is honestly taking a toll on my life.

What other options do I have?  I know IT is a very broad career path so there are a lot of options.  For reference, I'm not a programmer, I'm not a DB designer/developer, and I'm not a systems analyst.  I have a BS in Computer Science and Information Systems (with a concentration on the latter).  I have a CompTIA Security+ Cert, but being I'm only 22, I have very limited experience in that field other than the certification.  

Security might be the way I want to go in the future, being that there is such a large need for it.  But what other "roads" can I go down with IT?

<TEXT> Not a question, but I genuinely hope the hardest days are behind you and that you're looking forward to the future.  One of my best friends was diagnosed with grade 3 Anaplastic Astrocytoma December 2015, and after chemo/radiation therapy (and 5 brain surgeries later), the tumor still grew.  It is now grade 4 and they're calling in for hospice services because no treatment is working and he is only getting weaker.

It's a terrible thing that the family and all friends have to go through.  I'm so very sorry that you have to go through this and I'm praying for you and your loved ones.  You got this! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hoping someone can point me in the right direction here because this is the fourth time this sort of thing has happened to me.

I'm a temp IT employee at the company I work for.  I work 40+ hour weeks, but do not have any benefits/PTO because I'm still a temp.  This Winter was kind of rough on me, because we had 3 snow days and because I'm not "full-time", I don't get paid when I don't work.  

Now, the company is closing this week early (3:00pm let out instead of 5pm this Friday), which is nice because you can spend time with the family etc, but I'm not getting paid for it.  I know we're just talking about a couple of hours here, but this is messing up my already pretty tight budget.  How can I ask for this time back/ask to be paid for this time?  It's not like I deliberately took time off for this, if you get what I mean.  The company is shortening its hours and I feel that it's not fair to hourly employees like myself.

The company is pretty notorious for stringing temps along in hopes that full-time will be offered, but because they never offer it, the turnover rate is ridiculously high (and I'm looking elsewhere for a backup job as well).  

But not getting paid for these hours are pretty annoying, is there anything I can do about it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Positive.  That's the first thing I thought too...  So I drove the last week very modestly (shifting around 3-4krpm) to test it out and I was still getting very low numbers.  The width did change, I went from 215s to 225s and kept my wheels the same.

<TEXT> I recently got a set of high performance summer tires for my car.  After driving with them for a few weeks, I noticed my average mpg went from about 29 all the way down to 20.  It's important to note that different tires will be more efficient than others, but this isn't what I'm talking about here.


8mpg was too much for me to be losing in an economy car like mine, so I dug a little deeper.  I noticed that OEM tire pressure should be 32, and the tire shop inflated mine to 44psi (44psi is SUV/truck territory, cars should be around 30-35 psi).


I deflated my tires by 12 psi to OEM spec of 32 and my mileage has slowly been coming back.

Usually higher tire pressure means better gas mileage, but my case was the opposite.  Make sure your tires are at the right spec!

<TITLE> Why I hate applying to ANY IT job (rant) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-10 20:10:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First of all let me get out of the way that yes, finding a job initially is always difficult. My experience in IT recruiting has always been poor.


What ever happened to just working for a company? Literally every place I'm applying to now is actually me just applying to a consultant company acting as the middle man between me and the company I want to work for. Although this method is beneficial for the consulting company and the hiring company, I cannot express how many headaches it has given me. Maybe there were 3 out of the 50 I applied to yesterday that it was the actual company representing themselves.


The process: You apply. They call you from a 1800 number (or better yet- an "Unknown" number) with no way of you getting back to them. They tell you about the job description but they CAN'T TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE COMPANY because of "confidentiality reasons". What if I'm trying to do some background research on the company? I can't until the middle man submits me for the position so they can tell me the name. Then I can do research only to find out, "Oh, I don't want to work for this company after all".
Then there's the fact that middleman recruiters don't know anything technical- Sure, they can read the job description right off the screen in front of them, but any time you have a question about it, they can't answer it to save their lives- or they'll say to ask them at your interview.


here's a personal example:
The last company I worked for (for only 3 weeks)- the middleman recruiter gave me an incorrect job description. They said I would be working on a Desktop Support/Help Desk team for one of the "Big Four". Ok sweet, a job similar to what I had in the past. Set up computers, maintain them, assist users, etc. They never informed me that my *sole* job requirement would be to work in a call center and answer calls all day like a robot. Some "IT" job for sure. When I called up my recruiter to tell them this isn't what I had in mind/what they said it would be, I basically got a "Yeah if you can stick with it that'd be great". The next day I quit, and spoke with the recruiter once more who was cursing me out over the phone and TBH I couldn't give a shit because of how pissed off I was at the job in itself.


I just hate how impersonal this whole process is. Finding a job is difficult enough, and I know that there are others out there like me that graduate university and are intimidated by finding a job. I wish we could make this, as a whole, much easier.


Ok, rant done. </TEXT>

What is the best way to split up the times so we don't get too tired of driving / bored of driving?  I don't want to take 8 hour shifts like I did last road trip.  I'm thinking of splitting it into about 9 3-hour shifts.

<TITLE> TIFU by picking my nose at the doctor's office. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-06 14:10:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This one will be quick... literally just happened.

So I'm at the doctor's office, waiting in an examination room for the doc to come in. He's taking a while, and my nose felt stuffy- so naturally I went digging for gold up there. I'm getting into it and then the doctor knocks on the door rather loudly (maybe even banging on the door?). Anyway, me being so indulged in digging my way to China, this banging scares the shit out of me and my nail digs into the wall of my nostril causing a nose bleed that would not stop for the entire length of the exam. He laughed, I laughed (embarrassingly) and it finally stopped when I got to my car.



TL;DR: Went to the doctors office, picked nose in the exam room, doc knocked on door, scaring me shitless and leaving me with a bloody nose with as much power as the Nile itself.

edit: formatting

<TITLE> Stop spam calls? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-05 16:05:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On a daily basis, I receive up to 10 solicited calls from different scams/telemarketers.  These include "Senior Benefits", "Solar electricity", "Lowering my credit card interest", 100,000 mile car warranty...  etc.  

Every day, they are calling from a different number.  If I call the number back, it goes doesn't go through and I get the "your call cannot be completed as dialed".  Anyway, to the point.

I am waiting on legitimate calls and these calls are a nuisance and a waste of my time to be honest, not to mention getting my hopes up for it to be a legit caller.

I called Verizon about this and they offered to block the numbers calling in, or change my phone number.  Changing my number is not an option, and the numbers that call every day are different so giving them a list of numbers wont help them.

Im seriously fed up with these calls.  How can I get them to stop without changing my number?

<DATE> 2017-04-03 00:04:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Was driving today, shifting from 1st to 2nd.  Car was in gear (2) and I wasn't on the clutch, at this point I thought I was fully in 2nd gear.  Tried accelerating as normal but it was an abnormally slow acceleration.  Then followed by a gnarly waft of burning clutch smell (no smoke though).  This has never happened to me before, I'm not sure what I did or what happened.  Then I stopped at a light and went on, and it was just fine.


I'm usually very modest with my clutch use but this got me worried.  Thoughts? </TEXT>

My STi wheels are the same 17x7, but they weigh a little less than the stock subaru wheels IIRC.

<TEXT> I left a company last year in early November (in NJ).  I had about a weeks worth of sick time and another week of vacation.  Is it a requirement that companies pay you what you have earned in PTO?  I never asked for my PTO when I quit, and it's probably too late (5 months later) to ask for it now...  But for future reference.  Must a company pay you your PTO, or is that up to their discretion?  When leaving a company, how do you collect your PTO?

Edit:  is it too late to go back to said company and request my saved up PTO? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> With warmer weather around the corner, I'm considering throwing on a set of PSS.  A few questions though..

I'm a modest driver but every now and then like to get the tail end loose.  Will I still be able to oversteer/drift with PSS?  Or is the grip too much for the engine to break the wheels loose?

Also, I remember reading somewhere that the stock wheels (17x7) are designed for 215's, but 225's fit it too.  Is going with the 225's any bit risky?  The tire shop I go to are very hesitant to put on 225's when they know the stock fitment is 215mm.

Thanks! </TEXT>

As far as the snow...  Get some blizzaks and you'll have more fun in the winter than you do in the summer with this car!  But really, it's very snow capable with the right set of tires and a little common sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I post to every comment about the brz in the snow:


Just went on a 1200 mile road trip from Philadelphia to Lake Placid NY and back. Stock BRZ with WS80 Blizzaks.


We did it all. Plowed through the snow, started on snow covered hills, uphill, downhill, curvy roads, snow filled parking lots, sheer ice. At one point, we drove through about 5 inches of UNPLOWED white stuff. We did not get stuck once!!


I really had my doubts about this car in the snow. Rear drive, light weight in the snow isn't the best formula. We didn't have much in the trunk aside from our cargo.  All you need are the right tires and a bit of common sense.


This car amazes me.

<TEXT> My corporate office is upgrading laptops (i.e. Dell Latitude E7270) to Windows 10 and we have found that with Windows 10, they can't connect to our wifi.  We have a MAC filter in place, and our WLAN Policy Server is tied into AD for authentication.  Nothing has changed other than going from Windows 7 to Windows 10.  We keep getting the very vague, "Can't connect to this network".

<TITLE> Switching my car insurance to another carrier. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-07 21:26:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My family and I will be switching to another car insurance provider in search of lower rates.  My policy consists of my parents and me (22 year old male).  I have my own car that I'm making payments on, and the car is solely registered to me (NJ).  

We're browsing for new insurance plans, and in order for me to be on my parent's policy (to make my premium lower) the insurance company we're looking at requires my car to be put in my father's name (transfer of ownership??).  Must this be done?

The car is registered to me.  I have about $8500 left on the loan, my dad co-signed the loan so my interest rate is low.  

As I am still making payments on my car, I do not have title-in-hand (yet).

I'd hate to have to re-register my car to my dad, only to switch it back after a few years.  Does this legally make my car have more than one owner if I switched the name? 

Or, does switching the registration have anything to do with who owns the car?  Does the insurance want me to switch ownership, or registration of the car?

Multiple insurance companies aren't giving me straight answers here.  Currently, the car   registration is in my name and that is fine with my current provider who allows this to be part of my parent's policy.

Thoughts?

<DATE> 2017-03-03 14:33:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just recently listened to a song that I loved when I was a senior in high school (5 years ago now).  I tried playing the song today while working, but the nostalgia factor kicked in and my mind put me in a place that was identical to how I was feeling 5 years ago.  I felt the feeling that I had walking down the hallway to class, doing homework at lunch, or driving my car out of the lot at the end of the day.

This feeling was incredibly surreal and gave me chills.  I had to stop the song and switch it to something else before anything else happened, lol.

Music is incredibly powerful.  Anyone else experience a feeling similar to this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Quad core is always the better option for applications like this.  I don't have a newer model MBP to say from experience, but that's typically the way it goes.  Sure, the 13" can process the video, but you're asking a lot from a chip that wasn't made for this kind of data processing.  Other things will slow down, things will get hot and it will sound like your computer has asthma (from the fans).

I'd go 15" for this use case- the dedicated graphics are meant to handle this. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Secret Security Clearance and finding a job? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-20 03:47:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all!  I'm entertaining the idea of moving to D.C. within a few months.  First things first, I need a job.  I work in IT, dealing with computers, infrastructure, network etc.  Every job posting I've come across asks if I have "Secret Security Clearance" or "Special Security Clearance" (I forget what it was called).

Can someone shed some light to what all of these job applications are talking about?  I assume it's regarding confidential information and whatnot.  Is there any certification/clearance I must obtain to get a job in the city?  How do I get said clearance?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I work in IT, which really is a service job when you you think about it.  I'm servicing the company's computers/other IT equipment, and the users with their computer problems.  

So today I'm working with a user (let's call her Lisa) who is having troubles with her email.  While working with her, another user comes up to me for help (let's call him Phil).  

Some background on Phil:
Phil is in his mid 50's/early 60s, and he thinks he's "all that".  He isn't even a full-time employee, he's just a contracted temp.  He'll always try to get assistance first, and always asserts his way through.  I've had to stop what I've been doing multiple times just to help him and shut him up.  He's one of those people who says "thank you, I really appreciate it" but means none of the sorts.  

So back to the story.  I'm helping Lisa with her email and Phil comes up to me with a "pressing issue" that I have to reach out to an external vendor *immediately* because he screwed up (essentially throwing me under the bus, making me clean up his work).  Keep in mind that it isn't even my job to do this.

Phil rudely interrupts my conversation with Lisa, and at first I ignore him because I'm obviously working with someone else.  This annoys him and he says "hello?" to me to blatantly steal my attention away from Lisa.  

That's when it happened.  I stood up for myself for the first time in what feels like forever.  I said to him (in a talking-down tone, the tone you'd use while disciplining your kid), "I'm working with someone now, can you wait until I'm done with this?"  He replies sadly with "Yes."

He then waits directly outside of Lisa's cube for me.  That's when I said to him "You don't have to babysit me.  I will get to you when I get to you."  Phil stormed off furiously because he didn't get the attention that he thinks he deserves.  

Lisa stood there with her mouth open, and when he walked away, she mentioned how rude of him that was and how well I handled that.  

I got back to him 30 minutes later only to find out he fixed the issue on his own.  Oh, the glories of working in IT.

This is the first time I stood up for myself in a while and it felt great.  I'm 22, and stood up to a borderline senior bully.  I have no regrets!

TL;DR- Stood up to rude employee at work after dealing with his BS for a while and I've never felt better. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Skin Concerns] Cut on lips not healing- help? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-13 20:57:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It happened once again (same thing last year)... It was November, I was eating some food when I bit my lip. No big deal, I'll just keep applying bacitracin to it. 3 months later it's still there... the harsh cold makes it so hard to keep my skin (let alone lips) hydrated, and the heal times are killer.


It's gotten to the point where my lower lip is in a lot of pain most of the day, and after 3 months, I want my smackers to look like they used to. Last year, I went with the combination of Neosporin, Campho Phenique, and carmex religiously and my issues were cleared up within a week or so. This time around, not so much.
I'd like to avoid going to the dermatologist if I can help it, but I need something that'll clear this up soon. Don't really want to post pics, it's not gruesome but you don't really see what's going on through a photo.

<TEXT> I've worked a Desktop Support job for the past 2-3 years now (working for the in-house IT department) and am on the job search once more.  A lot of the jobs I am coming across are traveling jobs- i.e., you're a traveling IT tech, supporting and traveling to small businesses who don't have an in-house IT department.  I like the idea of being an in-house tech better, and not traveling all over the state as part of my job.  What are your opinions of this type of job?  

On the upside, this job has pretty good benefits and pay you back for your travels.  Plus, I'll be getting a lot of experience that I'm not currently gaining.  But then again, I'd rather not be traveling to different clients.

<TEXT> Actually, it really works.  My dad switched us to shared data last year by accident, and told me.  I called up verizon that day to reverse the plan change, and while they were *incredibly* hesitant to give us our unlimited data back, they did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> IIRC, they throttle you on the old UDP anyway.  There have been times where I was at about 10gb within the first week of my billing period and my LTE speeds were sloooooooow.


Edit:  I know where you're coming from...  I've had it for 6 years too, once the iPhone finally came to Verizon.  I hope now my upgrade process will be a bit easier, so I don't have to take my dad's upgrade and vice versa. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just switched to the new unlimited plan from my old, grandfathered plan.  My parents and I all had unlimited (grandfathered).  Switching to the new unlimited plan saves us over $160 a month, so I think it's  safe to say we made the smart switch.  And if we don't like it, there's a 30-day grace period to switch it back.

<TEXT> As the title says...

I reimaged a problematic machine, put it on the domain, logged the user in, connected to shares, etc.
Took a look in Active Directory, but the new computer doesn't show up.  The computer thinks it's on the domain but it really isn't?

This is preventing services such as Skype for Business, as well as UNC-ing into the machine.


I looked up this problem but anything on google didn't have any helpful answers.

The computer isn't hidden in any sort of OU.  It should just be part of the entire directory.

To troubleshoot, I took it off the domain and put it back on (2x already).

Any thoughts?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will **always** recommend winter tires, especially on a car like this.  Here's my experience:

Just went on a 1200 mile road trip from Philadelphia to Lake Placid NY and back. Stock BRZ with WS80 Blizzaks.

We did it all. Plowed through the snow, started on snow covered hills, uphill, downhill, curvy roads, snow filled parking lots, sheer ice. At one point, we drove through about 5 inches of UNPLOWED white stuff, and didn't get stuck once.

I really had my doubts about this car in the snow. Rear drive, light weight in the snow isn't the best formula. We didn't have much in the trunk aside from our cargo. 

All you need are the right tires and a bit of common sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was a complete detail job.  I only waxed it after a total wash (2 bucket method), and a clay bar session to get 100% of the road salt off.  

In this application, I used Maguire's Carnauba wax.

Apply the wax, let it dry, then wipe it off with a microfiber cloth.

Rydeen Duo feels like a rock, and is very solid/waterproof too.  I wouldn't trust a $28 camera for the same job if I want it to look and function as if it were OEM.

I would just get the Rydeen, total for it plus the harness was about $102.  10/10 would buy again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started a new job with a company that doesn't use a ticketing system, and I have asked my boss if we can implement one..  Not to say that I *like* tickets, but it's a much more unified way to solve user problems instead of everyone coming to the office and making me work on their problem right away.  I've had users fight with each other for my assistance because they came to the IT office at the same time.  Just trying to save myself this reoccurring headache.

What ticketing system do you use/like to use?  Possibly one that ties into AD (not a requirement though).  Can be browser-based OR a standalone app.  

What are your recommendations?

Every time, Lenovo sent out this tech that was in his 60s/70s, had long hair and was legit always high when he came in (red eyes, smelt like weed).  We called him Shaggy.  Then I asked Lenovo to stop sending him.

He replaced a motherboard but still didn't fix the issue.  and somewhere along the lines, he lost a key so he had to come back with a new keyboard.  I told him not to, and to just send me the part to replace myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ha ha...  When coworkers would go on vacation, we'd do funny shit to their desk.  Wrap everything in wrapping paper?  Each individual keyboard key?  You bet.

One of our colleagues left for a better opportunity.  On their last day, we decorated his desk with many, many naughty toys, such as dildos and penis lollipops.  A couple of blow up dolls too.

My favorite prank though?  That'd have to be when one of my team members went on vacation.  Because of the kind of retail Spencer's is, you can get product samples rather easily if you know who to ask.  Long story short, I poured out some of his purell and substituted it with some clear lube.  He's a germaphobe so he uses hand sanitizer constantly.  That was a good one.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just went on a 1200 mile road trip from Philadelphia to Lake Placid NY and back. Stock BRZ with WS80 Blizzaks.

We did it all. Plowed through the snow, started on snow covered hills, uphill, downhill, curvy roads, snow filled parking lots, sheer ice. At one point, we drove through about 5 inches of UNPLOWED white stuff. We did not get stuck once!!

I really had my doubts about this car in the snow. Rear drive, light weight in the snow isn't the best formula. We didn't have much in the trunk aside from our cargo.  All you need are the right tires and a bit of common sense.

This car amazes me.

<TITLE> TSX ECU / Electrical system haywire? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-10 19:47:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all, I had to drive my mom's TSX last week and I noticed something odd that I think needs to be looked at ASAP.  Something is a bit wrong with the electrical system of the car (I think?).

Examples:  
Rolling the windows down, they roll up

Increasing volume (from steering wheel controls) changes radio input/channel

Cruise control acting up as well.

Even though these are just minor things, I don't want anything incredibly important to fail because of a electrical problem while my mom is driving.

Thoughts?

<TEXT> When you first start up the car.  It's almost a grrrr / revving noise, coming from the dash board area just for a second.  It makes the same noise when you turn the car off and open the door.  

My only guess is that it's the ECU starting up/shutting down?  I'm not sure, my dad's Acura does the same.  

edit:  it's not an engine-related noise.

Edit 2:  https://vimeo.com/198880987

Anyone know what this noise is? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's my experience with my BRZ in the snow (copy/paste from r/ft86), album here http://imgur.com/a/tjztP:


Just went on a 1200 mile road trip from Philadelphia to Lake Placid NY and back. Stock BRZ with WS80 Blizzaks.

We did it all. Plowed through the snow, started on snow covered hills, uphill, downhill, curvy roads, snow filled parking lots, sheer ice. At one point, we drove through about 5 inches of UNPLOWED white stuff. 

We did not get stuck once!!

I really had my doubts about this car in the snow. Rear drive, light weight in the snow isn't the best formula. We didn't have much in the trunk aside from our cargo. This car amazes me.

And of course, we got very tail happy! 

TL;DR: If you plan on driving this car in the winter, get winter tires. I went all out with the Blizzaks with no ragrets.

<TEXT> Not sure about you but that was an incredibly beautiful segment.  Probably one of the best ones to come out of Top Gear/Grand Tour.  Incredibly informative and the way it was put together made me feel like I was watching a top-notch, 20-minute documentary.  May's segments were always good, but this one was in a league of its own.  

On the other hand, yes this show is very scripted.  But that segment was so well put together that I didn't even think/care about whether it was scripted or not. </TEXT>

Cake day, so why not post this awesomeness?  Just went on a 1200 mile road trip from Philadelphia to Lake Placid NY and back.  Stock BRZ with WS80 Blizzaks.

We did it all.  Plowed through the snow, started on snow covered hills, uphill, downhill, curvy roads, snow filled parking lots, sheer ice.  At one point, we drove through about 5 inches of UNPLOWED white stuff.  We **did not get stuck once**!!

I really had my doubts about this car in the snow.  Rear drive, light weight in the snow isn't the best formula.  We didn't have much in the trunk aside from our cargo.  This car amazes me.  

And of course, we got very tail happy!  Just look at the (almost) 180 spin in the main photo :)

TL;DR:  If you plan on driving this car in the winter, get winter tires.  I went all out with the Blizzaks with no ragrets. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Misplaced my Swiss Army knife. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the past couple of weeks, I seemed to have been missing my Swiss Army pocket knife.  Nothing fancy, just the mini $15 one that has the knife, scissors and nail file.  The last time I remember having it was when I drove in to Brooklyn a few weeks back.  

I put the knige in my backpack's water bottle holder, which I soon found out has slits in it to expand and accommodate bigger bottles.  I drove my mom's car into the city and threw my bag in the trunk.  When I got back home, I learned that my knife was not in my bag, and I knew *exactly* where it was.

For all this time now, I have known it's just in the trunk waiting for me.  But I went ahead and bought another one on Amazon because I'm that fucking lazy and didn't want to venture to the driveway.  I wonder if I'll be lively enough to get the package tonight at the door when it arrives.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> About to swap out the stockies for a set of Blizzak WS80's.  How do snow tires 'feel' on this car while daily driving (i.e., not when snowing, just when cold)?  Will I feel any difference in the way the car drives/handles?  From what I understand they'll grip the road better in the colder months.  I'm making this comparison to the stock OEM tires.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> My people believe there are spirits on the moon. Would you please take them a message from me? (x-post from r/space) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-22 16:44:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the surface of the moon. In the months leading up to their expedition, the Apollo 11 astronauts trained in a remote moon-like desert in the western United States. The area is home to several Native American communities, and there is a story  or legend  describing an encounter between the astronauts and one of the locals.

One day as they were training, the astronauts came across an old Native American. The man asked them what they were doing there. They replied that they were part of a research expedition that would shortly travel to explore the moon. When the old man heard that, he fell silent for a few moments, and then asked the astronauts if they could do him a favor.

What do you want? they asked. Well, said the old man, the people of my tribe believe that holy spirits live on the moon. I was wondering if you could pass an important message to them from my people. Whats the message? asked the astronauts.
The man uttered something in his tribal language, and then asked the astronauts to repeat it again and again until they had memorized it correctly.

What does it mean? asked the astronauts. Oh, I cannot tell you. Its a secret that only our tribe and the moon spirits are allowed to know.

When they returned to their base, the astronauts searched and searched until they found someone who could speak the tribal language, and asked him to translate the secret message. When they repeated what they had memorized, the translator started to laugh uproariously. When he calmed down, the astronauts asked him what it meant. The man explained that the sentence they had memorized so carefully said, Dont believe a single word these people are telling you. They have come to steal your lands.

<TITLE> Just picked up a helpdesk analyst job... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-09 01:54:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all, I just started a job as a helpdesk analysts working for one of "The Big Four".  I'm 22, and I am coming from a Desktop Support Technician job for a mall-retail chain.

The helpdesk job I picked up is a contracted position, strictly phone-based support and live chat.  Where I used to work, we did phone support for our field users and would go around the building assisting users with their respective needs.   I am coming from an environment working with hardware, networking aspects (i.e. TCP/IP, working on patch panels/switches/routers etc), and face-to-face contact with other individuals.  The new position I picked up is nothing like that- just 100% on the phone.  

I know this isn't the right attitude going into the job (especially being my first week here), but this honestly does not seem like the right job for me.  I really took the job to "get my foot in the door" with an amazing company, and to possibly getting to a desktop support role here.  Turns out, that takes a lot, and a lot of time (I asked around, up to 5 years from what I've gathered).

The work I'm going to be doing now seems very tedious, repetitive, and frankly, does not seem challenging.  For example, I was told that the only use for going into Active Directory is to unlock an account/change a password.  Where I'm coming from, we not only did this, but did user account creations, file/folder path mappings, group policy, managing computer groups, etc.  We also orientated users with their equipment, deployed computers, repaired hardware- all aspects of work I like to be doing.  That just won't be happening at this new job.

I just don't want my previous skills going to waste by not exercising them regularly like I used to at the last job.  In the meanwhile, I have already been applying to other jobs just to get out of this boat ASAP.  I know it's sounds crazy being I just started, but I know what I want in a job, and this is **most certainly** not it.

I know I'm only 22, but I have a lot of knowledge and skills, degrees and most recently certifications that I highly value.  I don't want to be putting them to shame by not being able to use them.

I guess I just wanted to go on a rant and vent about this to someone.  

Thoughts?




edit: Thanks for the replies!  I have 3 interviews elsewhere tomorrow! </TEXT>

I also have experience with working with computer hardware and networking, user training/orientation, computer deployments, etc.  However, this will not be the case at the new position, and I'm afraid this job isn't what I'm looking for.

The thing is, this help desk spot is at an incredible place to work for; one of "The Big Four".  If anything, it's something to put on my resume and a job in the meanwhile.

So, those of you who strictly work phone support at a help desk, how do you like your job?

<TITLE> Was recently offered a helpdesk position at one of the "Big Four"... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-15 02:27:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all, as the title says, I was offered a helpdesk position at one of The Big Four, working on a team of about 60 others.  Contract position at first, with intent to hire if things go well.  I'm currently working as a Desktop Support Technician, with a team of 3 people.

The helpdesk job that is being offered to me is 100% phone support, dealing with people all over the country.  Although I am used to this already, I am also used to working in an environment with people on an in-person basis, not just over the phone.  

I also like dealing with hardware and networking fundamentals, but this is not what I will be doing at this new job.  For example, at my current job, I was working on a patch panel in the building the other day.  In my new role, I would not be doing anything like that.  Just solely tech support over the phone.

I feel that I am going backward in my career if I take this job (granted, I'm only 22), because in order to be a Desktop Support tech there, you have to be *promoted* from the help desk, which could take months, even years, although there is room for advancement.

Ideally, I want another job in Desktop Support or hopefully networking within a few years.  

The helpdesk job is more than I'm making now.  It's with an amazing company to work for, as well as to put on a resume.  It doesn't sound too bad, but why am I just not sold on this?

They have to know if I accept the offer by Monday and I haven't got the slightest clue what I'm going to tell them. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's 11:15 and about time I took my morning break.  I went to the gym we have in the office to ride on the bike for a bit.  There's a rule about the office gym, which is to leave it as you found it.  The lights were off and I didn't see anyone in there.  So, I left the lights off and got on the bike.  Once the workout was set up, I put on my music.  I hit 'Shuffle Play' on Spotify, and "Rape Me" by Nirvana came on.  
As I was getting into my workout, I started singing.  It got intense.  Rape me...  Rape me...  RAPE ME.

Turns out I wasn't the only one in the gym.  Also turns out that I have a date with HR tomorrow morning. </TEXT>

I know I am working backwards here, but how does Net+ compare to Sec+ in terms of difficulty?  I know the subject matters are different, just curious to how they compare in terms of how hard they are to pass. </TEXT>

I have a beard, rather short but a beard nonetheless. Should I shave it off for the interview? Like I said, it's an IT position. Almost every place I've worked in, I've had team members with facial hair.
Just looking for your two cents! Thanks! </TEXT>

When the car is on, I can't seem to lock it with the remote.  I have to use the physical key and door lock to lock the car, and even that gets hairy.  

Is this a security feature of some sort?  Can I turn this off?  FWIW, it's a Limited BRZ with push-start </TEXT>

I should mention that I'm not looking for a raise, as I'm not looking to stay at this company much longer at all; I've already interviewed with other places closer to home.  


Tomorrow, I have a meeting with my boss to go over my performance reviews. During this meeting, can/should I bring my concerns up to him? I'm not putting in my two weeks at the meeting, but I think he should know it's not going to work out for me much longer. The job I currently have requires a bit of knowledge of our system, so I feel it is the better, more moral thing to do than to just give only two weeks of notice. Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recent college grad here. Just got a job and am now living on my own, never had too much luck with the ladies.  I'm single, 22 and a virgin.  

I've been on dating sites and apps (Tinder, Bumble, OkCupid to name a few), but honestly, the area I live in (South Jersey) is really sparse when it comes to women on social dating sites.

Honestly, the main problem here is just finding people. Due to finances, I'll be moving back at home soon for a bit.  Hopefully it'll be easier because it's a much more populated area, but this just gets me more depressed every day.

<TITLE> Passed SY0-401 with an 806! Here's what I did to study. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-22 19:19:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just took the exam and passed with an 806/900, and wanted to share my experience!  About this time last year, I took a Cyber Security class in college which taught right  out of the CompTIA textbook for Security+.  I wanted to take the exam in February 2016 but couldn't because of unforeseen circumstances.

I studied for this from the beginning of July to yesterday (09/21).  I watched Professor Messer's videos, while taking notes on everything.  My textbook came with a voucher to "Certblaster", so I had some practice questions to work with.  I also purchased GCGA's 30-day access with mock exam questions.  Also took use of examcompass.com.  Lastly, when I purchased the exam from CompTIA, I took the 2-exam bundle with CompTIA's CertMaster access.  I had quite a bit of resources for this exam.

My exam had 72 questions and 4-5 simulation questions.  It was hard to say the least.

I was halfway through the exam and I was pretty confident I failed it already, as many of the questions I had to answer with educated guesses.  After submitting the exam and taking CompTIA's post-exam survey, I was so shocked that I passed with such a score.  

That's my experience guys, thanks for all the help and good luck to you all!

<TEXT> Have you considered the power of the 86?  It's not the fastest car out there, it's pretty laughable.  These things you call "features" are more-so factors put together to make a car that handles as well as this one does.

<TEXT> Like many others have said on this post, although you say it must be sporty, perhaps it's really *not* what you're looking for.  

For it's price range, the 86 is one of the best handling vehicles on the market.  There are better cars to sit in traffic in.  This one is loud and things rattle inside the cabin.

I saw your post in r/cars, you didn't even know this car was RWD.  RWD isn't necessary for racing per se, but it's essential to a great-handling car.  

Have you looked at some sedans on the market?  There's plenty of sporty ones out there.  

I honestly think you should do a bit more research on what you want to be your next car.

<DATE> 2016-09-02 00:02:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Little bit of a back story. I'm a recent college graduate who is turning 22 on Sunday. It took me until now to come to senses with how I've been feeling lately.

Because my college internship hired me full-time, I accepted the job because it was employment right out of school. When we all graduated (my roommates and best friends), we moved out of our college house and parted ways. I stayed in the area for my job, and found an apartment to rent. My summer was great, because one of my other friends from school roomed with me for before he had to go back to school. As of last Wednesday, I've been living on my own for the first time in my life.

I don't know many people in the area, and my phone sure isn't buzzing like it used to. Besides the fact that I don't have a significant other (or never have for that matter), I'm not the most social person. I'm living in a pretty rural area and finding people (not only someone to date, but friends also) is hard to come by- even dating/meetup apps have been not helpful for me.

It's taken me until now to realize, that I really don't have anything in my life besides work. Work is starting to become a bother, because I'm incredibly underpaid for my field and my take net take home is about $200-$300 at the end of the month (after all expenses). If my parents weren't able to help me out with my groceries, I would be going into my savings to work at a job I'm not happy with anymore. I plan to have a new job before the start of next year. A lot of the time I question why I didn't just find a job back at home and live with Mom   Dad for a year or so.

I've dealt with depression in the past, and have been prescribed SSRI's which I did not like. I felt that they didn't work for me and I felt mad at the fact that I had to take a drug to make me feel "normal".

Tears are beading down my face as I'm writing this post, as it looks like I'll be spending my 22nd birthday alone- the first birthday I've ever spent not in the presences of friends or family.
I really don't know what I'm expecting from this post. Maybe some advice, or a feeling of comfort. Mainly just to vent out because I haven't had anyone in my personal life to talk to about things like this for a while now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heard this song at my friends house while I was mid-waking up, so I didn't think to Shazam it.  All I remember is that its chorus went something like "It doesn't have to be like this".  Searching Google did no help for me.  It sounded like a modern rock kind of song (I think).  Thoughts? </TEXT>

1) You could go the expensive route and replace the front bumper if it's that much of a bother.  
OR you could check out Bumper Plugs.  https://www.bumperplugs.com/index.php?route=product/category path=1_11

2) No clue.

3) Good luck finding 0% ethanol on the east coast

<TEXT> Hi all- this should be quick.

Started talking to this girl that I'm pretty into now, we're not official yet but have gone out a few times.  She tells me she doesn't drink because of family history with alcohol and all.  I don't have a problem with this as I'm not a heavy drinker, but personally, I'd like to get drunk with my girlfriend every once in a while.

Would this deter you from a relationship with someone you liked?

<TEXT> Completely wrecked my STi passenger-side side skirt because I was impatient, drove around someone who was stopped in the middle of the street for whatever stupid reason.  Didn't even see how close to the curb I was until it was too late and the skirt was destroyed.  Scared the shit out of me.  Those things are a bitch to replace, but I'm glad I didn't fuck up the wheels.

Just goes to show how low to the ground these cars are, and now I'm much more careful with mine.  Lesson learned. </TEXT>

One tip- Make sure you can really afford it.  Yeah, you're out of college and might have a full-time job but if you don't put enough down in the beginning, those payments will haunt you for years to come.  Unless you just buy it with cash in full.  If you have a car that works and is paid off, run it till it won't run no more. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Diminished Value claim. Where do I begin? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-22 16:08:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Was recently in an accident (rear ended) and was obviously not at fault.  My car was in the shop for a week and after $1500 in repairs, it looks good as new.  In the end, it was really only a fender bender with no frame damage.  I was okay.

It's a new car, and had only 12k miles on it.  It was probably worth $22-23k prior to the accident.  

The repairs are now complete and they look great, but I obviously have to deal with the fact that it has an accident on its record and the  diminished value that comes with it.  I'm going to get an appraisal sometime soon, but my guess is that when I try to sell it in the future, I'm going to run into some problems i.e., getting less than it should because of the accident.  My first thought is to contact my insurance to get as many details as possible, then contact the other insurance company involved.

I want to settle this as soon as possible, where do I begin?

<TEXT> This.  All of this.  As a recent college graduate (21) who just bought an 86 in February, I can easily say I definitely enjoyed my Altima during school much more than I would have my BRZ.  Although I did have it the past spring semester.

Bottom line, for a first car, start with something more practical.  I run into challenges fitting people/things into the thing, so there are definitely more people-friendly options out there.  

What is it that you want essentially?  RWD?  Manual?  You might want to look into some older   used German cars. </TEXT>

I'm on my parent's insurance policy and they have good coverage so I'm not worried.  It's gonna need a new bumper and aero kit.  I'm just upset that it now has an accident under its belt.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Car payments... Pay off now or continue monthly payments? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-06 18:13:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi!  I just bought a new car back in February.  I'm 21, and I paid the majority as a down payment (trade in, $7k and about another $12k down) and thus my monthly's are just about $150, with 2.49% financing.

Although I have the savings to pay it off, I chose to go with monthly payments to give myself some breathing room.  I have just under $10k that I owe on the car.

I have about $22,000 saved up (and in my mind, it's really $12,000 of savings and $10,000 of debt).  My question is, should I just pay it off?  The benefits I see here is that I don't have to pay the interest and that the monthly payments go away (by obviously paying off $10k).  Thoughts? </TEXT>

I've been studying the vocabulary/key terms from each chapter, but on the exam, will there be any questions regarding **just the definition** of such terms?  Or are they all situational based questions that you have to apply the vocabulary?

i.e., might I see a question as such?:

Honestly, the main problem here is just finding people.  What would you recommend, being that dating sites really are not too powerful in this area? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thoughts? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-02 01:41:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ever since a young age, I've noticed weird coincidences in my life.  I think of a song, I'll hear it on the radio.  Think of a particular TV episode?  That's on TV that day.  Sometimes I think of what someone might say (mid conversation), and they'll say it (or something along those lines).

A few weeks ago, my roommate and I were in our backyard when he noticed an interesting looking spider.  I said to him, "remember the time we saw that black widow here"?  And what do you know, a black widow crawls right in front of my feet.

Today, I went to the bank for a deposit.  My friend from high school, Brett worked there so I thought I would see him and say hi.

I didn't see Brett working.  Then when I'm pulling out of the bank, there he was.  But here's the catch- He doesn't work there anymore!  I just happened to see him going to the ATM. 

Also today, I was thinking about watching a special of a comedian I enjoy.  That exact special was on the Laugh Radio channel.

I don't know if this is "psychic" behavior, but there are definitely more coincidences in my life than I can count.  They have been happening to me more and more recently, and I'm not sure who to talk to about it or to see if it should be looked into.  
I've always thought of higher beings (God) and spirits, and I don't know if this is one's way of trying to connect to me.  I have always felt that I have had someone or some force looking over me.

I am more spiritual than I am religious (Judaism).

What are your thoughts?  Any input is appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad and I both have unlimited data on our iPhones. Come the next time we upgrade, that $30/month for unlimited will jump to $50/month. Unlimited data is great and all, but I'm missing out on features like mobile hotspot, early upgrades etc.

If we get a shared data package, it will stay around the same price, but we will have that data cap now. Also will be sharing with my mother. I use the most data between everyone due to streaming and other things.
Is it really worth keeping unlimited at the current point in time? It's been great having it for 5 years but is it beneficial over shared data anymore?

Honestly, it mainly comes down for my need of a mobile hotspot, which I will need sometimes.  If I wanted to get the feature added, it costs $30 for 2gb of data. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 10.11.4, but have had this problem for a while now.  Mid 2012 MBP, 16GB + SSD.  Whenever I wake my Mac from sleep, it tries to connect to WiFi.  You see the wifi bars loading animation like it's trying to connect.

Any internet-related application will pinwheel and go into "not responding" mode.  It will do this for up to 3 minutes or so, but by then I just kill it and do a hard reboot (if it comes to that).  This happens daily.

Does anyone have this issue?  It seems like the computer is just confused when trying to reconnect to the network so then everything else goes with it as well. </TEXT>

<TITLE> When anxiety strikes. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-27 19:23:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Whenever something big happens in my life, my body goes into full 100% anxiety mode. Mainly over the fear of the unknown. This is no exception, because right out of college I was offered a full-time job. Great! However, I will be moving into my own place without any roommates, and the thought of being alone like that honestly scares the hell out of me. For the first time in my life, I will be living alone. The only thing I will have in life is work, and no one will be there when I get home at the end of the day.

When anxiety strikes, my whole body is affected. I get depressed and lethargic, not to mention that I lose my appetite, get nauseous, and lose any motivation to make food or even eat. Has anyone else run into this issue? What can you do? Force feeding doesn't work, doing so just makes me gag and possibly throw up.

For those really intense panic/anxiety attacks, I use Xanax (prescribed) but I really only like using them for those purposes.

Do you guys have any advice? Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Working in a corporate environment and recently upgrades our Macs to El Capitan.  Last night's upgrade went fine, but the Mac will not display images properly (pictures show up as a little blue box with a question mark in the middle).  

We thought this was just an issue with Microsoft Outlook, but it's more widespread and affects other apps such as Safari and Mail.  The machine (rMBP 15") is on 10.11.4, and we're not updating to 10.11.5 until we test the build to be sure it is stable.  

Anyone else have this issue?  What would you do?  It's currently affecting 2 of some 25 users. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right...  A bit *too* right actually.  Yeah, I'm really not interested in being a POS tech.  It's a pretty big step in the wrong direction at the moment.  But, assuming a desktop position opens up, this is the best route to get there.  

But in financial terms...  I would probably be saving around $10k/year as opposed to saving upwards of $50k at home...  It's really not hard to tell that this isn't the best option for me.  Even if a desktop spot opened up, I'd be saving a similar amount to that of POS (but a little bit more).

Back at home, I pretty much have a desktop/help desk job lined up already.  Essentially, what it looks like it comes down to is that I'll be missing out on making an additional $40k just to *not* live with my parents. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there- I'm a recent college graduate, major in Computer Science   Info Systems, concentrating in Information Systems.  For the past year, I have been working a Desktop Support tech for a retail chain's corporate offices, as an intern, then a temp associate.  Due to my recent graduation, it looks as I'll be moving back home because they can't hire me full-time (at the moment).

Although the full-time desktop gig isn't available, my boss offered me a full-time job as a POS Support technician, which works on the store POS systems.  I'm considering it because in about half a years time, it is likely that there will be a full-time spot open on the Desktop Support team.  This is what my boss told me, as he is trying to keep me on.

Only thing is...  I feel that I would be selling myself short if I took this POS job.  Studying Computer Science for the past 4 years and really not apply it post-grad is not ideal for me.  But I could be wrong.  What would you recommend?

<TEXT> Graduating from a no-name university this Sunday (BS in Computer Science   Info Systems, concentration in Info Systems). I have been working an IT Internship/Co-op in a corporate office for a retail chain (Desktop Support/Help Desk) for the past year, but I'm not staying with the company post-graduation due to the department's budgets.

I've been applying like a mad man to jobs all around the Greater NYC area, and all are a similar position to what I have now.
I know certifications are important too, and I'm already studying to take Security+ from CompTIA. Security might be the area I want to end up in, I'm not entirely sure yet.

My question is, right out of college, can I expect to find a higher-tier job than just working at a help desk? I understand the longer I stay with it, the more experience I will have and will be able to move onto greater positions, such as network and server administration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all-  I might be moving to Philly soon!  In either the Poplar/Northern liberties area (I believe)- right next to the highway and not far from center city. 

Thing is, I just bought a new car and I'm not sure how comfortable I am living in the city with it.  Keeping the car is a high priority, but so is finding a place to live.  Ideally, I wouldn't be driving to work if I work in Philly.  

How do you guys fair having a car in Philadelphia?  To make things that much more annoying, it's a manual transmission- which will probably never see passed 4th-5th gear due to city driving.  

Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! Just got a callback for another interview regarding an IT Tech position at a high school. Because of my distance (still away at Uni until graduation), we have done one Skype interview, and I believe the next interview will be over Skype as well.

One thing I haven't brought up previously was the salary I would be making. I feel that waiting until the 2nd interview to inquire about compensation is the more professional thing to do, to make it look like I'm not only in it for the money.

If I feel comfortable enough during the interview, I want to bring up the inquiry about how much I will be making (keep in mind, this is my first "real-world" job right out of college, excluding internships). How can I do so in a professional and humble way?
Thanks! </TEXT>

Open ended lug nuts

Spacers

Question, what Extended ARP Studs and open ended lugs are compatible with stock wheels?  Or is that all standard?

Also...
20mm-25mm will make you "flush"

Do you mean 20mm front, 25mm rear?

<TEXT> Something caught my eye on the roof of my car; what looked to be dried tree sap actually seems to be a drop of clear coat over an un-touched up crack in my paint. Whatever, the dealership did a crappy job and I'm not going back there to get it redone (distance too far). Thoughts?

What I might do (once I get the equipment) is wet sand the hump of clear coat down a bit then wax it all over. I don't think there's any sense of adding any touch up, because the cracks have been filled in by the previously applied clear coat. I unfortunately don't have a picture at the moment.

What would you do?

<TITLE> Auto Loan: Pay off now or continue monthly payments? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-26 21:55:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all!  I just purchased a new car.  I had enough aside (plus a trade in) to make the down payment the majority of the payment, and only financing about $10k @ 2.49%.  This comes out to a very low $154/month.  I recently came into a bit of money and was wondering what to do.  I can increase my monthly payments and pay off the loan sooner, or I can even just pay it off in full now if I wanted to- and save myself the interest, while still having some savings left over.  What would you do in this situation?  The interest rate doesn't pose too much of a threat to me but I'd rather pay off my loan sooner than later.  
Any advice is appreciated!  Thank you </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've watched this video a few times in preparation for touching up a few nicks on my car.  In the video, he wet sands the area so touch up is flush with the regular paint.  Then, he waxes away the wet sand marks.  
My question is, why on earth would you put sandpaper up to your paint, even if you're wet sanding?  Doesn't this just rip apart the clear coat?
And if it does take away the clear coat, how does the wax restore its shine?  Thanks!

<TEXT> My 6s has been running poorly lately and I want to restore and start from scratch (not a backup).  Before doing so, I would back up all my photos to my Mac, then transfer them back to my phone post-restore.

I tried this as a test with live photos, but when I sent them back to my iPhone from my Mac, they were just still images.  How can I preserve the live-aspect of the live photos during the transition to a fresh OS?

Thanks!

Anyone have recommendations what paint to buy/where to buy it from for a the best match?  Some sites I've found sell paint kits, which includes all tricoat layers; basecoat, midcoat and clearcoat.  I've looked at paintscratch.com which seems to be the safest bet.  Also, would you recommend getting the touch up pens, or opt for the paint-brush style?

That ship has sailed; I've tried countless times to like her in a "relationship way" but I can't seem to do it.  I just don't like her that way, and I can't force an attraction as such.  I've expressed how I don't want a relationship.  Then she goes and posts this on facebook:

<TEXT> I've always been annoyed by people chewing in a disgusting manner.  That includes chewing with your mouth open or like a slob, obnoxiously crunching and the dreaded gum chewers.  Today I was in my quilting class, which is arranged so that four students sit at each table.  As we were working on our projects, I noticed the girl across from me chewing and cracking her gum like she was getting paid to do so.  Instinctively, I plug in my headphones and tune her out.  Seconds later, she asks me "is our conversation not good enough for you?  Why would you put on your headphones in class?" to which I reply (keep in mind, I was about to explode) "BECAUSE YOU CHEW YOUR GUM LIKE A FUCKING COW."  Everyone looked up.  Professor looked up.  Then everyone went about their business. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Appetite Problems </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-23 13:49:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ever since I was young, I've had major anxiety throughout my life.  Overthinking things, being too cautious, you name it.  There are even some times when the anxiety becomes too great and I lose my appetite.  
I'm approaching graduation from Uni and leaving my best friends, current job and living arrangements.  Needless to say, it's been quite the anxious wreck for me.  Not to mention that I really haven't had a full meal in days.
I can't bring myself to eat.  As much as I try to force-feed myself, it will just come back up.  My stomach is growling because of its emptiness, but when I look at food it makes me want to throw up.  It's a Catch-22 because I'm trying to help myself but my body won't allow it.  Even drinking water is a bit hopeless.
I'm noticing I'm getting very tired, exhausted, and losing a little weight.  All things I don't want to be doing..  but it's very hard to come out of this "food strike".

Any advice?  Thanks! </TEXT>

I've looked at the guide on ft86club.com (http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showthread.php?t=35621) but the pictures are no longer on the thread and I have no idea what the guide is referring to.  Is there a better guide or video showing how to do this?  I'm a car noob and don't want to fuck anything up. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Graduating with a BS in Computer Science and Information Systems... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-12 18:02:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> With a concentration on Information Systems.  Come graduation, what kind of entry-level jobs can I expect to get?  Here's some background experience I have from the courses I've taken:
 
    -Programming knowledge (a little bit of Java/VB)

     -Database

     -Systems Analysis and Design 

     -Networking

     -Security (I plan on taking CompTIA Security+ in a month or so)

I don't plan to be a programmer.  It's not my forte, I know I would work better in other areas of IT.  Ideally, I'd like to be a system administrator or Network admin.

I've been working a couple of help desks during my undergraduate studies...  the help desk at University, and a Desktop Support internship (over the summer) that I continue to work at to this day.

What kind of entry-level positions can I expect to find in Network/System administration?  I'm possibly looking to move to the west coast post-graduation...  Portland OR, specifically, and help desk jobs there don't have such great starting salaries.  I need to be making somewhere around $50k-$60k+ for relocation to make sense.

Thanks!

<TEXT> Hi! Looking to buy my own car (BRZ!) and stop driving around the one "mommy and daddy" gave me. I've been saving money all my life (I'm 21 yo) and have close to $20k saved up. Looking to finance a car that's close to $25k, and trade in the current car worth around $7500 now. Is this possible to do? Here's a little more background info:

-I'm a 21 year old about to graduate college. I have $0 of debt and no student loans (very fortunate).

-If I put enough down, including the trade in, I can probably get the costs to (hopefully) less than $250/month.

-I don't think money is too much of an issue here, because once I graduate and get a full-time job with a nice salary (Computer science major, heh), payments shouldn't be all that bad. I already have job offers so I'm not worried. Even if I'm without a job, I have enough savings to not worry about the car for at least two years.
Am I crazy, or is this something that I can fit in my budget?
Thanks!

<TEXT> Hi all- Going to graduate this spring with a BS in Computer Science   Info Systems...  might as well get started on my certs!  I'm looking to do the CompTIA Trio; A+, Net+, and Security+.  
I just took a course last semester called "Information Assurance and Security"...  professor basically just taught straight from the CompTIA Security+ textbook (CompTIA Security+ Guide to Network Security Fundamentals, 5e).  I've been training myself with Professor Messer (taking notes while watching videos), while using the book as a second source of studies.  Typically I'll watch one section of Professor Messer per day (pacing myself).  I plan to take the exam sometime mid-February.
This textbook also gives me access to certblaster.com for practice exams and drills.
I have been taking four years of computer-related courses, which includes Networking, so I have a somewhat decent background there.  My professor told me to take the Security+ ASAP, while the information is fresh in memory.  I agree with him and am going to do so; but I'm just wondering how anyone else fared by taking the Security+ exam first.  Thanks!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Question] iPhone tethering, not jailbroken? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-30 23:53:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all!  I'm anxiously awaiting the 9.2 jailbreak like everyone else, but mainly for one specific reason; making my iPhone a mobile hotspot.  With Verizon and Unlimited data, this option is not available unless you jailbreak/find an app with hidden tethering functionality.  Does anyone know of such an app that is available at the moment?  Or another way to tether without paying the ridiculous additional $30/month?  I need internet connectivity to continue work in a remote location without internet access.  Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey there, just deposited some old savings bonds from around when I was born.  Two $50 bonds, one $100 bond and one $500.  They have earned $33.02, $66.04, and $330.20 in interest, respectfully.  How come their total value is $58.02 for the $50's, $116.04 for the $100, and $580.20 for the $500?  What does their interest have to do with this number, and what happens to that interest that was never given to me from the bank? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not how loud it sounds...  but its attraction; specifically towards coppers.  I'm a modest driver looking to get a BRZ soon, but coming from driving a Nissan Altima, the BRZ is definitely more of an attention grabber for the police I'm assuming.  What has your experience been like?   </TEXT>

Unfortunately I haven't seen any in my area (east coast, NJ)...

<TEXT> Not entirely sure if this is the correct subreddit to post to, but it's worth a shot I suppose..  I bought a Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse (bluetooth, no dongle) for my Mac.  It's an awesome mouse that I use daily, but the one thing about it that I don't like is the vibrating feedback when you scroll with it.  Is there any way to control the settings from a Mac?  I understand there is a Windows application where you can control its settings, but even through a virtual machine, the settings don't cross over to the Mac.  Any thoughts?  Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some background info... Met this girl last year. We hooked up a couple of times back then but she wanted a relationship, and I just wasn't there. Fast forward to now, we started talking again recently. Her intentions are the same; she wants a relationship. I have no idea why, but just don't feel like I want to date her. There's nothing wrong with her- she's nice and pretty.  All my friends think I should go for it.  On paper, she's probably perfect for me, but theres just some underlying lack of attraction that I can't do anything about.  And I feel like I'm just leading her on if I continue to talk to her, and I don't want to feel bad about it anymore.

Can someone please explain my feelings to me?  Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> iPhone 6s Battery Problems (Samsung Chip) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-25 18:43:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let me start out by saying since I got my iPhone 6s (Samsung chip -__- ), the battery life has been poor since day one and the phone gets incredibly hot.  The other day, my iPhone was at a 75% battery level. I put it down to cook some food and came back not 20 minutes later only to find my battery dropped by 23%. The only open app was Spotify, and no music was being played, nor was anything occurring in the background.  Back to the unit getting super hot...  Especially on a phone call, the glass gets too warm to the touch and actually feels uncomfortable on my cheek. Sometimes it's in my pocket doing nothing and my right thigh feels like it's on fire.  

Finally -get this- yesterday, I plugged in my phone to charge it up (using Apple wall adapter and Apple lightning cable) from 55%. Checked back on it not five minutes later and the battery was at 52%.  I finally stopped being lazy and called up Applecare about this.  I was tired of these problems that my previous iPhone 6 never had (not once).  

The representative ran a diagnostic on my phone and it showed that the battery life was in the realm of where it should be.  But something stuck out to her while analyzing the diagnostic- the iPhone was reaching temperatures of 139 F (I knew it felt uncomfortable to use for some reason...).  She then tried to schedule an appointment at the Genius bar for me, but the closest Apple store is in Atlantic City which is a pain to get to.  So she set up an express replacement on my phone and I should be getting a new unit (TSMC PLEASE PLEASE) this week.  
Not trying to rant to this subreddit, but if you have any problems similar to the one(s) I've had, don't hesitate to call Applecare.  They will get you taken care of.  All the best!

<TEXT> Hi there, I'm looking to join the 86 club!  I'm currently looking at a 2015 BRZ Series.Blue with ~15,000 miles on it, asking price is $26,800.  I understand that this car is rather small, and interior space can get quite crammed.  I'm coming from a Nissan Altima, with plenty of extra space that I feel I don't need.  Only problem is that once I get the BRZ, I feel that I will greatly miss the extra room.  Owners of an 86 (any model of it) that came from a slightly larger car, how do you feel about the lack of space?  Do you regret the purchase, or does the car make up for it with that huge smile it puts on your face?  Thanks! </TEXT>

Looking at it's fuel economy, it shows that the 2016 model is less fuel efficient than its predecessor (34/25 vs 30/22).  Can someone explain these price and fuel efficiency differences to someone who really doesn't know all that much about cars?  Thanks!

<TEXT> Been trying to restore my 6s to a backup I made earlier today. First I wiped the phone clean then tried to restore from backup.  iTunes has been stuck at 2 minutes of time remaining, which is slowly increasing.  It is now up to 6 minutes remaining with no signs of progress.  Has this happened to anyone else?  What would you do?  I would think to kill the restore, then restore it to original factory settings again.  Then to try another restore from backup?  I'm not sure.

I'm going to let this sit for another 20 minutes, and if there are no signs of improvement, will try the process over once again. </TEXT>

I deleted the gmail1 account through google, but how do I unlink the youtube and gmail1 accounts now so that i can put my new gmail address on it?  I'd be very surprised if you can't do this.

<TEXT> When my roommates and I moved into our house, we had to have internet services installed.  When the Comcast representative started doing his work, he commented on our collection of old video games.  I replied to him saying, "Yeah, they're great.  It's crazy how nostalgic they make you feel".  He didn't know what "nostalgic" meant.  He didn't admit it, but he he had no idea what I was talking about.  This happened in front of my roommates, and the room was silent but just filled with awkward.  You could tell immediately that he regretted not going to school.  Stay in school kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there.  At uni, one of my good friends is trying to get me to join the Kappa Sigma fraternity.  From what I understand, it is very well-respected in the greek life world.  I just never saw myself as a fraternity brother...  just not my kind of thing I guess.  My friend (who is on the executive council) has been bringing me out to the welcome week events that Kappa Sigma hosts, to get to know the brothers prior to pledging.  I'm still feeling pretty "meh" about it..  I don't have a reason to join but at the same time, I don't have a reason to not join.  I guess I always found people in fraternities/sororities to be a bit pretentious about the whole greek life subject matter...  but who am I to judge.  Being that my friend is an executive, I shouldn't have any problems getting in; it would actually make the process easier as he tells me.  Anyway, I guess what I'm asking here is for opinions?  What has greek life done for YOU?  Why would you recommend it? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help me help my father get more business! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-15 01:45:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My father operates a small Ball Bearing shop in NYC.  Over the past 10-15 years, many (approximately 60% of his customers from the 90's) electric motor companies and automotive shops have closed and it has definitely affected the business.  We recently put up a website (for inquiries, not e-commerce) that displays the products and brands we carry, for the end-user to be familiar with our stock.  We also joined an email marketing company to send out product lists to business that might be interested in what we're offering.  
     Long story short, our marketing endeavors really haven't been of much help.  We've received a few inquiries here and there, but most people are marking the mail as spam.  Others have even complained that "we should be fined for the amount of emails we send".  We're just trying to bring in business so we don't have to close our business.  
     We're starting to come to the conclusion that we might be at a loss...  but there's got to be more that we can do.  My mother searches daily for businesses around the tri-state area, as well as the rest of the country that might be interested in what we have to offer, but we have just recently been informed that this sort of soliciting is illegal.  
     I guess I'm here asking for ideas to bring in more business (that seems to be the golden question anyway, right?).  Every night I see my dad come depressed, because it's always the "same old" lack of business that he deals with on a daily basis.  I've stopped asking him how his day was at work because I don't want to upset him any more than his business does, and it kills me on the inside.  

Any advice is appreciated...  Thank you (:


Edit:  Thanks for all your input!  Just a thought, would it be effective to hire a marketing agent to help us out here?  Obviously we're trying all we can to save money, but if this will bring in more business, we're willing to give it a shot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A strange thing happened to my roommates and I when we plugged in our vacuum to the power outlet.  When you flip the switch to turn on the vacuum, the light switch turns on. The vacuum, however, does not.  It might be important to note that the light switch and the power outlet are in the same wall socket.  
We tried plugging in different devices such as a pair of clippers, a lamp, and an external battery, none of which acted the same as the vacuum.  And no, no one is flipping another switch to make this happen.  We're completely dumbfounded.  
Any thoughts?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi All, I'm in the market for a new Macbook Pro.  I'm looking at the baseline configuration of the 15" Macbook Pro with Retina Display (2.2GHz, 256GB SSD, 16GB RAM).  However, this configuration doesn't meet my storage criteria.  I'm looking to have 512GB of storage.  I know I can configure this on the checkout page, but the 512GB upgrade costs a whopping $400.  Is there any place to find what I'm looking for?  I understand that the SSD has to be PCI-e based, but I'm not sure about how compatible the ones I'm finding on NewEgg or OWC are with this Macbook.  Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a 15" 2012 MBP (non retina, HRAG) w/ 16GB and a 512GB SSD, running 10.10.5.  I started noticing something weird when connecting it to an external display.  I plug the machine into my TV via HDMI cable and an HDMI-to-thunderbolt adapter.  All goes well, as long as the displays are mirrored.  The second I set the arrangement to extend the display of the laptop, the screen flashes (as normal) and reconfigures itself.  Once the displays are up and running, the color on my MBP's screen gets all out of whack.  The TV displays normal colors, but the Macbook's screen seems to have the Hue settings wrong (all my blues turn to orange).  Change the mode back to mirror, and all is good in the world.  I even messed around with the color calibration, but that did nothing for me.  The profile on my my Mac reads "Color LCD", as it should.

I have reset the PRAM, as well as the SMC.  Any thoughts on what I could be experiencing, and how I can fix it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The company I work for recently ordered a few new MacBook Pros for new users. The only problem is that these machines are running Yosemite. Normally, we would just roll the machine(s) back to Mavericks. We have tried many things- wiping the drive and installing Mavericks via network boot and USB boot, among others. Any time we try to boot these machines into a Mavericks installer, we get the image displayed on the screen (http://imgur.com/c8wV1xn). Could it have to do with the force touch trackpad being only used on Yosemite and above? Would that be an issue? Is it at all possible to roll these back to Mavericks? Thanks!

<TEXT> So my dad dropped the unlimited data on our lines in favor of the 10gb/month shared data plan.  Needless to say, I'm annoyed because I've been hanging onto my unlimited data for years.  According to Verizon, I have 60 days to change the plan back, but shared data has one thing attractive about it- included personal hotspot.  The only thing I don't like about shared data is that we now all have that dreaded data cap.  Does anyone have experience with switching from unlimited data to shared data?  It would save us about $70/month, but is that worth dropping something you can never get back?  Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's my situation. I'm a 20-year old Computer Science student (with a concentration in Information Systems). I go to a small liberal arts school in New Jersey, which isn't known for its computer science related degrees. I have a strong technical background, and am the go-to person when people have a problem with their equipment. Come September, I'll be a senior on track to graduate in May. I've also picked up a summer internship working in the corporate offices of a retail store chain. I work in their IT department --Desktop Support, to be specific-- repairing laptops (and other equipment), setting up desktop workstations, deploying software and fixing any issues that associates come across. Although I love this internship, I can't see myself doing this much longer once I graduate... The pay isn't quite where I need it to be (starting salary ~30k... I'm looking to make at least double that once I graduate). I'm not good at coding (it's just not my forte- I know this for a fact), but I want something more technical than what I'm doing right now. What should my next move(s) be? I know I should get myself Cisco certified, among others. Also, come time for graduation, what kind of job position should I be looking for? Preferably something within IT management. Any answers are appreciated, thank you!
