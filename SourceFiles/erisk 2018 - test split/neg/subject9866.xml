<TEXT> This looks like a Japanese deer. There's a park there, Nara maybe? I'm on mobile and too lazy to look it up. In Nara Park the deer are treated extremely well and have become fairly tame so it's common to be able to walk up and pet one. Even more so with young deer who are more curious and less nervous around humans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've recently taken up nature photography as a hobby and I've been posting the photos to relevant Reddit subs and my Instagram feed (it's @fillsyourniche if you're interested).  There's also some lab dissection in there so fair warning if that's not your thing, but it's pretty far back in the feed.

Anyway! I end up posting a little blurb about each organism and through this, I am having a great time getting to know my local flora and fauna much better than I ever have. Even when I was doing field work I was only really focused on the endangered birds I was studying so now I am getting to know other organisms. I was thinking about making a blog out of it, but I'm not sure where to start. I'll also be starting a Ph.D. this Fall which will be ecology-related so I'd probably add research stuff in as well.

Do any of you have science blogs? What are yours about? I'm thinking about tieing it in with this username because I use it for everything; Twitter, Instagram, here and Flickr. Another thing to worry about is Doxxing myself, but I'm not sure I'm worth stalking and I only post things here that I wouldn't be ashamed of connecting to my real name. I'm pretty PC and PG-13 rated for the most part.

That was long-winded! Any advice is welcome. Thanks, ladies! </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Full and free journal article ink.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347217301124)

**Highlights:**

* We assess whether a great tit breeding population is structured by personality.
* Network analyses were conducted on a 6-year data set from this wild bird population.
* Males show positive assortment, nesting nearer to similar personalities (bold/shy).
* This assortment was not found to be related to local environmental variation.
* We discuss implications for natural and sexual selection on personality in the wild.


**Abstract:**

Animal personalities can influence social interactions among individuals, and thus have major implications for population processes and structure. Few studies have investigated the significance of the social context of animal personalities, and such research has largely focused on the social organization of nonterritorial populations. Here we address the question of whether exploratory behaviour, a well-studied personality trait, is related to the social structure of a wild great tit, Parus major, population during the breeding season. We assayed the exploration behaviour of wild-caught great tits and then established the phenotypic spatial structure of the population over six consecutive breeding seasons. Network analyses of breeding proximity revealed that males, but not females, show positive assortment by behavioural phenotype, with males breeding closer to those of similar personalities. This assortment was detected when we used networks based on nearest neighbours, but not when we used the Thiessen polygon method where neighbours were defined from inferred territory boundaries. Further analysis found no relationship between personality assortment and local environmental conditions, suggesting that social processes may be more important than environmental variation in influencing male territory choice. This social organization during the breeding season has implications for the strength and direction of both natural and sexual selection on personality in wild animal populations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello! Thanks for the great question.

Plankton feeders are their own category; [*planktivores*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planktivore).

There are four different groups of plankton; Phytoplankton (*phyto* = plants),  Zooplankton (*zoo* = animal), Bacterioplankton (*bacterio* = bacteria + archae), and Mycoplankton (*myco* = fungi). If you want to be super specific, it depends on what type of plankton the plankivore is eating to determine whether or not it's a carnivore, omnivore or herbivore. Really though, most filter feeders will swallow up whatever is in the area without really discriminating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Ig Nobel is for novel research that is unusual or trivial, but not a joke [Via Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize):

The Ig Nobel Prizes are parodies of the Nobel Prizes given out each autumn for 10 unusual or trivial achievements in scientific research. They have been awarded since 1991, with the stated aim to "honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think". The awards can be veiled criticism or satire, but are also used to point out that even absurd-sounding avenues of research can yield useful knowledge.

The researchers for this study still published their findings, under peer review, as the article [*Alteration of the platelet serotonin transporter in romantic love.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10405096) If the research was not sound it would never have been published in a reputable journal.

I've published my own research and it's not an easy process or trivial.

Here is the abstract:

**Abstract:**

**BACKGROUND:**

The evolutionary consequences of love are so important that there must be some long-established biological process regulating it. Recent findings suggest that the serotonin (5-HT) transporter might be linked to both neuroticism and sexual behaviour as well as to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The similarities between an overvalued idea, such as that typical of subjects in the early phase of a love relationship, and obsession, prompted us to explore the possibility that the two conditions might share alterations at the level of the 5-HT transporter.

**METHODS:**

Twenty subjects who had recently (within the previous 6 months) fallen in love, 20 unmedicated OCD patients and 20 normal controls, were included in the study. The 5-HT transporter was evaluated with the specific binding of 3H-paroxetine (3H-Par) to platelet membranes.

**RESULTS:**

The results showed that the density of 3H-Par binding sites was significantly lower in subjects who had recently fallen in love and in OCD patients than in controls.

**DISCUSSION:**
The main finding of the present study is that subjects who were in the early romantic phase of a love relationship were not different from OCD patients in terms of the density of the platelet 5-HT transporter, which proved to be significantly lower than in the normal controls. This would suggest common neurochemical changes involving the 5-HT system, linked to psychological dimensions shared by the two conditions, perhaps at an ideational level. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist flying in. You're God damn right it is!

This example would fall under the "[sexual selection](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_28)" category of natural selection; where females choose the brightest, most stand-out male they can (in this case, it's not always).

This seems counterintuitive because the males will stand out to predators as well. The reasoning behind this is even though this beautiful, loudly colored male is bright as Hell, he has avoided predation into his reproductive years. A male like this must have some pretty impressive genes to keep it alive with all the attention it must be getting.

It's the same concept with peacocks and their giant, unwieldy, heavy tails. A male is going to have a hard time maneuvering, but if he makes it to reproductive age there must be something special there. 

I love it! Definitely ! </TEXT>

The students that I am seeing are not very informed, which I am assuming is why they take my class, but very willing to listen and understand the data. I haven't had any outright deniers, only a few who just weren't sure because again they were uninformed.

It's imperative that the next generation has this data available to them and not only at a college level. This should be taught in middle school and high school. Maybe it is? I'm not sure, but most of my students only knew what they read on social media - which is pretty alarming. The government trying to hide this is just disgusting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those interested, here is a link to the full and free journal article, [*Osteology of Galeamopus pabsti sp. nov. \(Sauropoda: Diplodocidae\), with implications for neurocentral closure timing, and the cervico-dorsal transition in diplodocids*](https://peerj.com/articles/3179/).

**Abstract:**


Diplodocids are among the best known sauropod dinosaurs. Numerous specimens of currently 15 accepted species belonging to ten genera have been reported from the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous of North and South America, Europe, and Africa. The highest diversity is known from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the western United States: a recent review recognized 12 valid, named species, and possibly three additional, yet unnamed ones. One of these is herein described in detail and referred to the genus Galeamopus. The holotype specimen of Galeamopus pabsti sp. nov., SMA 0011, is represented by material from all body parts but the tail, and was found at the Howe-Scott Quarry in the northern Bighorn Basin in Wyoming, USA. Autapomorphic features of the new species include a horizontal canal on the maxilla that connects the posterior margin of the preantorbital and the ventral margin of the antorbital fenestrae, a vertical midline groove marking the sagittal nuchal crest, the presence of a large foramen connecting the postzygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossa and the spinopostzygapophyseal fossa of mid- and posterior cervical vertebrae, a very robust humerus, a laterally placed, rugose tubercle on the concave proximal portion of the anterior surface of the humerus, a relatively stout radius, the absence of a distinct ambiens process on the pubis, and a distinctly concave posteroventral margin of the ascending process of the astragalus. In addition to the holotype specimen SMA 0011, the skull USNM 2673 can also be referred to Galeamopus pabsti. Histology shows that the type specimen SMA 0011 is sexually mature, although neurocentral closure was not completed at the time of death. Because SMA 0011 has highly pneumatized cervical vertebrae, the development of the lamination appears a more important indicator for individual age than neurocentral fusion patterns. SMA 0011 is one of very few sauropod specimens that preserves the cervico-dorsal transition in both vertebrae and ribs. The association of ribs with their respective vertebrae shows that the transition between cervical and dorsal vertebrae is significantly different in Galeamopus pabsti than in Diplodocus carnegii or Apatosaurus louisae, being represented by a considerable shortening of the centra from the last cervical to the first dorsal vertebra. Diplodocids show a surprisingly high diversity in the Morrison Formation. This can possibly be explained by a combination of geographical and temporal segregation, and niche partitioning.

Our giant friend here would have difficulty attacking the diver from that angle unless it changed course to come straight at him. Coming up from underneath and alongside the rail the diver is behind makes it difficult for the shark to grab him given the shark's size. He's a brave man, but fairly safe here.

A little more about this amazing animal! Her name is *Deep Blue* and she is a 20 foot long Great White shark (*[Carcharodon carcharias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white_shark)*) . The reason she looks so massive here is because she is very pregnant. She was videoed off the coast of Mexico's Guadalupe Island by  shark researcher Mauricio Hoyos Padilla.

Here are a few articles on her, though they will all be pretty similar:

* [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3194207/The-real-life-Jaws-World-s-largest-shark-nicknamed-Deep-Blue-flashes-razor-sharp-teeth-new-awe-inspiring-video.html) with several close up photos and a little more backstory. For some reason, hopefully a typo, Daily Mail called her a mammal. Of course she is not a mammal! All sharks are members of Class [Chondrichthyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrichthyes) and are cartilaginous fishes. 

* [Discovery channel](http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/shark-week/shark-feed/learn-more-about-deep-blue-one-of-the-biggest-great-white-sharks-ever-filmed/)

* [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/International/video-footage-reveal-largest-great-white-shark-caught/story?id=33038151)



On a side note; I know Great whites, especially this big momma here, are scary. Great whites are listed as "vulnerable" though on the [International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/3855/0), meaning the species is likely to become endangered unless conditions improve. These amazing animals need our support and help and it is important to remember every animal has a place here regardless of how scary/ugly/creepy/etc. they may be.

Great Whites get a bad rep, but they don't cause nearly the amount of attacks we think they do. According to the [International Shark Attack File](http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/Statistics/statistics.htm#white), Great White sharks have been implicated in 280 unprovoked attacks on humans globally between 1876 and 2013. That's only about 2 attacks worldwide per year. Or for an easier read here is the [USA Today article from July 4th](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/04/great-white-sharks-rebound/29711213/). </TEXT>

There's a lot going on in the video, it's really something amazing to watch! 

I love the color display happening here. It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells that reflect light and hold pigment and are found just below the skin. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and some insects also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a small sack full of pigment (black, brown, orange, red or yellow) which can stretch. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear more dull. Aside from chromatophores some cephalopods also have [iridophores](http://en.termwiki.com/EN/iridiophore) and [leucophores](http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2646). Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates which create iridescent colors (greens, blues, silvers and golds) which you can see in [this photo](http://www.the-scientist.com/images/February2013/Fig1A_Loligo-Overview---pic-from-Grayson-Hanlon.jpg) of *[Loligo paeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longfin_inshore_squid)*. Leucophores mirror back the colors of the environment, helping the animal blend in with its surroundings.
Some cephalopods can change the texture of their skin by manipulating [muscular hydrostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat). Hydrostats can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. [Our tongues have muscular hydrostats which allow us to stretch it out.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopus-arms-human-tongues-intertwine-for-science/) According to a [paper published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.20221/abstract):

The octopuses [in the study] had three dedicated types of muscles that control their on-call skin protrusions, or papillae. One set are shaped in concentric circles to lift the skin vertically away from the body. Another set pulls this form together, to determine the shapewhether it will be a round bump or tall spike. And a third group seems to pull the raised section back toward the surface, spreading out its base.

There's also some inking at the end. Cephalopods release ink when escaping predators, or stunning their prey, but  these cuttlefish are using it in battle! The ink comes from a [sac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_sac) located between the gills of the cephalopod. It's actually an extension of the animal's gut. All cephalopods aside from those dweeling very deep within the ocean have ink sacs. They aren't necessary where there is no light. Depending on the type of cephalopod you will get a [different ink color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod_ink); black for octopuses, blue-black for squid and brown from our friends here, the cuttlefish. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can read more about the fight in this news article [*Wild cuttlefish love triangle caught on film for the first time*](http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2017/05/02/Wild-cuttlefish-love-triangle-caught-on-film-for-the-first-time/1621493747885/).

There's a lot going on in the video, it's really something amazing to watch! 

I love the color display happening here. It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells that reflect light and hold pigment and are found just below the skin. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and some insects also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a small sack full of pigment (black, brown, orange, red or yellow) which can stretch. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear more dull. Aside from chromatophores some cephalopods also have [iridophores](http://en.termwiki.com/EN/iridiophore) and [leucophores](http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2646). Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates which create iridescent colors (greens, blues, silvers and golds) which you can see in [this photo](http://www.the-scientist.com/images/February2013/Fig1A_Loligo-Overview---pic-from-Grayson-Hanlon.jpg) of *[Loligo paeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longfin_inshore_squid)*. Leucophores mirror back the colors of the environment, helping the animal blend in with its surroundings.
Some cephalopods can change the texture of their skin by manipulating [muscular hydrostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat). Hydrostats can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. [Our tongues have muscular hydrostats which allow us to stretch it out.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopus-arms-human-tongues-intertwine-for-science/) According to a [paper published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.20221/abstract):

<TEXT> Clemson University's article about the research [*35-year South Carolina alligator study uncovers mysteries about growth and reproduction*](http://newsstand.clemson.edu/mediarelations/35-year-south-carolina-alligator-study-uncovers-mysteries-about-growth-and-reproduction/?utm_source=homepage).

[Journal article link.](http://www.asihcopeiaonline.org/doi/abs/10.1643/CH-16-430?=)

**Abstract:**

The perception that crocodilians exhibit indeterminate growth is common in the general reptilian literature. However, this assumption is frequently based on observations of immature and young adult animals and therefore lacks a complete understanding of adult growth patterns. Long-term mark-recapture studies appear to be the most certain method of determining growth patterns of adult crocodilians. From 19792015, we conducted a mark-recapture study of an American Alligator (*Alligator mississippiensis*) population on the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center (YWC) in coastal South Carolina to examine long-term growth patterns and the influence of age on multiple reproductive parameters. We found no discernible linear growth in 19 of 31 adult female and 7 of 19 adult male alligators over periods of 533 years. The mean maximum reproductive lifespan for female alligators on the study site was 46 years, and females continued to reproduce for an extended period of time after reaching maximum size. The Schnute growth model predicted that male alligators grew at a faster rate and attained a greater estimated mean terminal snoutvent length (SVL) than females (males = 186.9, CI0.95 = 184.5, 189.3 cm; females = 135.9, CI0.95 = 134.1, 137.8 cm) at the hypothetical age 75. In addition, the model predicted that males exhibited a greater estimated mean size (SVL = 182.0, CI0.95 = 179.6, 184.4 cm) and age (43 years) at which growth essentially ceased when compared to females (SVL = 131.4, CI0.95 = 129.5, 133.2 cm; 31 years). However, actual growth records of individual alligators suggested that the growth model may have overestimated the age at which male alligator growth ceased. The estimated mean earliest age at sexual maturity was 11.6 years (CI0.95 = 10.5, 12.8) for males and 15.8 years (CI0.95 = 14.5, 17.1) for females. We also documented that alligators on the site commonly live to 50 and can possibly live to 70 years of age. This study provides evidence that both male and female American Alligators in a population in coastal South Carolina exhibit a pattern of determinate growth and adds to a growing list of studies suggesting crocodilians as a group exhibit this growth pattern rather than indeterminate growth. Our findings are important for modeling population growth and determining sustainable harvest rates, particularly for alligators living near their northern distributional limit where growing seasons may be shorter and onset of sexual maturity later than in more southern portions of their range. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist peeling in! 

This both a ridiculous and wonderful gif. Terrestrial crabs feed on a wide variety of foods, sometimes peeling bark back from trees to find insects or to eat rotting vegetation. I think this little jerk is doing just that. A second option is it's tasting the paint and deciding it's not food, but given crabs are not very smart it just keeps going. They're running on instinct here.

I can't believe this mess! I love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your comment has been removed. We do not tolerate rudeness here in our happy sub. Not everyone would inherently know bats do not have an appendix. It's actually incredibly fascinating for a mammal to be missing a digestive organ. Considering we often view things from a human-centric view it's important to take into account how other organisms have evolved and why.

Please take your negativity elsewhere. Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha what a ridiculous gif. It looks like the crab might be tasting each piece, deciding it's not food, and dropping it but it's hard to see. Because with each new chip it leaves a jagged piece to grab still on the pipe the crab just keeps going! Terrestrial crabs eat a wide variety of foods, sometimes insects, so it could be confusing the paint with tree bark. I think this is more likely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The research was published in the journal *Soft Matter* which gave me a giggle. 

This research goes nicely with the finding that most mammals [take roughly 21 seconds](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24425-universal-law-of-urination-found-in-mammals/) to empty their bladders. 

The journal article [*Hydrodynamics of defecation*](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/sm/c6sm02795d/unauth#!divAbstract) is behind a paywall, but here is the abstract:

Animals discharge feces within a range of sizes and shapes. Such variation has long been used to track animals as well as to diagnose illnesses in both humans and animals. However, the physics by which feces are discharged remain poorly understood. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we investigate the defecation of mammals from cats to elephants using the dimensions of large intestines and feces, videography at Zoo Atlanta, cone-on-plate rheological measurements of feces and mucus, and a mathematical model of defecation. The diameter of feces is comparable to that of the rectum, but the length is double that of the rectum, indicating that not only the rectum but also the colon is a storage facility for feces. Despite the length of rectum ranging from 4 to 40 cm, mammals from cats to elephants defecate within a nearly constant duration of 12  7 seconds (N=23). We rationalize this surprising trend by the model, which shows that feces slide along the large intestine by a layer of mucus, similar to a sled sliding through a chute. Larger animals have not only more feces but also thicker mucus layers, which facilitate their ejection. Our model accounts for the shorter and longer defecation times associated with diarrhea and constipation, respectively. This study may support clinicians use of non-invasive procedures such as defecation time in the diagnoses of ailments of the digestive system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The relationship between pollinating insects and brightly colored flowers is a very intimate one. Flowers used to be green and brown, drab, and their pollen was a source of food for insects. You lose some that way, but it's still better than relying solely on the wind for reproduction. Early on beetles and flies were pollinators, attracted to plants that stunk like rotting meat. As time went on flowers transitioned into something more attractive; bright colors and the evolution of petals (I think magnolias and water lilies were the first to evolve petals - bright white). From here the plants specialized to attract specific pollinators and became brighter to outdo each other in attractiveness. I'm not sure on the evolution of UV vision in insects, but I think it's a fairly old trait. Later, we finally get nectar production which was a game changer. Now insects are eating the Nexus instead of pollen, which allows for more pollen to be spread around for reproduction. Nectar allowed for insect mouthpart specialization - long proboscises in butterflies, moths, and flies or somewhat long in bees. Bees became so specialized and reliant on flowers nectar and pollen are their only food source. Much different than butterflies, moths, and flies who have larval stages that do not eat nectar.

It was a long road to pollinating and not any one trait it transition that caused the switch. Remember Evolution is a process with many steps. There was a niche to be filled as plants evolved and bees were incredibly successful at filling it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of this according to a new study. I love new research! 

The main point of the article is actually the relatedness between ants and Apoids, but I loved the evolution aspect of wasps and bees. Apoids are the closest living relatives to ants. They all share an order, [Hymenoptera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenoptera), but for the first time, we have DNA evidence of just how closely related they all are.

For anyone interested [here is the link](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\(17\)30325-1) to the full and free journal article.

Or for the quick and dirty:

**Highlights**

* UCE phylogenomics provides a highly resolved phylogeny of the stinging wasps
* Ants are the sister group to bees and apoid wasps
* Bees are nested inside crabronid wasps and sister to Pemphredoninae+Philanthinae
* Outgroup choice and taxon sampling can strongly impact phylogenomic inference

**Summary**

The stinging wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) are an extremely diverse lineage of hymenopteran insects, encompassing over 70,000 described species and a diversity of life history traits, including ectoparasitism, cleptoparasitism, predation, pollen feeding (bees [Anthophila] and Masarinae), and eusociality (social vespid wasps, ants, and some bees) [1]. The most well-studied lineages of Aculeata are the ants, which are ecologically dominant in most terrestrial ecosystems [2], and the bees, the most important lineage of angiosperm-pollinating insects [3]. Establishing the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees helps us understand and reconstruct patterns of social evolution as well as fully appreciate the biological implications of the switch from carnivory to pollen feeding (pollenivory). Despite recent advancements in aculeate phylogeny [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], considerable uncertainty remains regarding higher-level relationships within Aculeata, including the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees [5, 6, 7]. We used ultraconserved element (UCE) phylogenomics [7, 12] to resolve relationships among stinging-wasp families, gathering sequence data from 800 UCE loci and 187 samples, including 30 out of 31 aculeate families. We analyzed the 187-taxon dataset using multiple analytical approaches, and we evaluated several alternative taxon sets. We also tested alternative hypotheses for the phylogenetic positions of ants and bees. Our results present a highly supported phylogeny of the stinging wasps. Most importantly, we find unequivocal evidence that ants are the sister group to bees+apoid wasps (Apoidea) and that bees are nested within a paraphyletic Crabronidae. We also demonstrate that taxon choice can fundamentally impact tree topology and clade support in phylogenomic inference. </TEXT>

Summary:  

Two luminous arches stretched across the dome of the sky on this northern spring night. After sunset on March 29, the mountain view panorama was captured in 57 exposures from Chopok peak in central Slovakia at an altitude of about 2,000 meters. The arc of the northern Milky Way is visible toward the right, but only after it reaches above the terrestrial lights from the mountain top perspective. Though dusk has passed, a bright patch of celestial light still hovers near the horizon and fades into a second luminous arch of Zodiacal Light, crossing near the center of the Milky Way. Dust in the ecliptic plane reflects sunlight to create the Zodiacal glow, typically prominent after sunset in clear, dark, skies of the northern spring. Almost opposite the Sun, Jupiter shines brightly near the horizon toward the left. Since Jupiter lies near the ecliptic, it appears within the slight brightening of the Zodiacal band also opposite the Sun called the Gegenschein. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dragonflies don't have any stinging appendages, as bees or wasps do. They can bite you, as they have some pretty serious [mandibles](https://bybio.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/12-spotted-skimmer-face.jpg), but even then unless they get you on the webbing of your finger you probably won't notice. If you catch a dragonfly you might notice them opening and closing their mouthparts repeatedly.

Females have what might look like something that they can sting with at the end of their abdomens, an [ovipositor](http://wongchunxing.com/DragonFly/Ovipositor/Zyxomma_petiolatum5.jpg). They're not used defensively, but a female could mistake your leg or arm is a plant (especially if you're near or in water) and accidentally try to lay eggs. Again, it's not a defensive strategy, it's a mistake and likely pretty rare. </TEXT>

Also, saying you have a partner is a gentler way of saying you're not interested, this way it's not an outright rejection of the other person.

**Abstract:**

At sufficiently high temperature and energy density, nuclear matter undergoes a transition to a phase in which quarks and gluons are not confined: the quarkgluon plasma (QGP)1. Such an exotic state of strongly interacting quantum chromodynamics matter is produced in the laboratory in heavy nuclei high-energy collisions, where an enhanced production of strange hadrons is observed2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Strangeness enhancement, originally proposed as a signature of QGP formation in nuclear collisions7, is more pronounced for multi-strange baryons. Several effects typical of heavy-ion phenomenology have been observed in high-multiplicity protonproton (pp) collisions8, 9, but the enhanced production of multi-strange particles has not been reported so far. Here we present the first observation of strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity protonproton collisions. We find that the integrated yields of strange and multi-strange particles, relative to pions, increases significantly with the event charged-particle multiplicity. The measurements are in remarkable agreement with the pPb collision results10, 11, indicating that the phenomenon is related to the final system created in the collision. In high-multiplicity events strangeness production reaches values similar to those observed in PbPb collisions, where a QGP is formed. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The genomic changes underlying both early and late stages of horse domestication remain largely unknown. We examined the genomes of 14 early domestic horses from the Bronze and Iron Ages, dating to between ~4.1 and 2.3 thousand years before present. We find early domestication selection patterns supporting the neural crest hypothesis, which provides a unified developmental origin for common domestic traits. Within the past 2.3 thousand years, horses lost genetic diversity and archaic DNA tracts introgressed from a now-extinct lineage. They accumulated deleterious mutations later than expected under the cost-of-domestication hypothesis, probably because of breeding from limited numbers of stallions. We also reveal that Iron Age Scythian steppe nomads implemented breeding strategies involving no detectable inbreeding and selection for coat-color variation and robust forelimbs. </TEXT>

It doesn't. This is not a conscious decision to look like a snake. This is all happening at the genetic level; mutations that together start looking like a snake. It's random and there are only so many genetic combinations that will create only so many types of morphological outcomes. None of this is planned and again it takes many many generations, thousands. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist popping in here! Someone summoned me further down but I figured I'd share here too. This is a masterpiece of evolution. :)

This species is *Hemeroplanes triptolemus* (family [Sphingidae](http://www.butterfliesandmoths.org/taxonomy/sphingidae), more on them [here](https://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/nature-blows-my-mind-caterpillar-looks-like-snake-hemeroplanes-triptolemus.html)). Mimicry is a pretty fantastic and fascinating part of evolution! This caterpillar is the larval form of Hemeroplanes triptolemus a moth of the family Sphingidae (more on them here). These guys are found in parts of South America, Africa and Central America.

This type of mimicry is called [Batesian mimicry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batesian_mimicry), where a harmless organism mimics a harmful organism. In this case, the caterpillar is mimicking a tree viper.

This process is very very long and takes several generations. Don't forget about all of the caterpillars that hatched and didn't make it, there are a lot of failures along the way here. So for this path to snake looking caterpillars, I'll explain this as plainly as possible; a few caterpillars hatch and grow, maybe some sort of resemble the coloring of this snake or have better overall camouflage than their brothers and sisters. They survive to breed and with others who also have advantageous morphology. From there those that look even closer to the snake survive and so on and so forth. It's usually *a very slow* process that takes generations for them to mimic something on such an impressive level. It's not always only one mutation that does this either, it may take many mutations to really get it "right."

Batesian mimicry is an incredibly successful form of mimicry! The other kind is [*Mllerian mimicry*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_mimicry), where two or more harmful species that look similar in appearance mutually advertise themselves as harmful. An example here would be many [wasps and hornets](http://www.wildones.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2013/09/BeeAndWaspChart.jpeg) having black and yellow striping to advertise they are unpleasant to be stung by or [poisonous tropical frogs](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/cb/41/ab/cb41ab5d510e2e2808c8286caada9852.jpg) having similar patterns and bright coloration. Fun thing about wasp coloration they are also part of the Batesian mimicry scheme of other harmless organisms such as [this hoverfly](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Wasp_mimicking_hoverfly.jpg) or this [robber fly](http://bugguide.net/images/raw/LQB/R3K/LQBR3KVR3KNRYKWRI01R70CQM0BR3K1RRQCQ20CQG0VRHQJQYKBRXQAR3K1RHQFR90FQU0S0P0OR.jpg).

**Abstract:**

Recently rediscovered black phosphorus is a layered semiconductor with promising electronic and photonic properties. Dynamic control of its bandgap can allow for the exploration of new physical phenomena. However, theoretical investigations and photoemission spectroscopy experiments indicate that in its few-layer form, an exceedingly large electric field in the order of several volts per nanometre is required to effectively tune its bandgap, making the direct electrical control unfeasible. Here we reveal the unique thickness-dependent bandgap tuning properties in intrinsic black phosphorus, arising from the strong interlayer electronic-state coupling. Furthermore, leveraging a 10nm-thick black phosphorus, we continuously tune its bandgap from 300 to below 50meV, using a moderate displacement field up to 1.1Vnm1. Such dynamic tuning of bandgap may not only extend the operational wavelength range of tunable black phosphorus photonic devices, but also pave the way for the investigation of electrically tunable topological insulators and semimetals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist walking in here. I really love this gif! If ever there was a reminder of how closely related we are, here it is. I never make two trips either if I can help it. My man RandyMagnum here is speaking with some insight.

As we all know, we share [98.8%](http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/human-origins-and-cultural-halls/anne-and-bernard-spitzer-hall-of-human-origins/understanding-our-past/dna-comparing-humans-and-chimps/) of our DNA with these amazing animals. Though I see that percentage change depending on the source, but not by much. It's incredible to think such a tiny number of nucleotides separates us. 

There are two species within the genus *Pan*: [Common Chimpanzees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee) (*Pan troglodytes*) and [Bonobos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo) (*Pan paniscus*). They diverged from a common ancestor around [2 million years ago](https://www.eva.mpg.de/3chimps/files/apes.htm) and are very different in the way they look (morphologically) and behave. I have no idea which species our fruit carrying friend here is, I'm not a *Pan* specialist. I do know, however, their social structures are very different as is their behavior in general.

Bonobos are much smaller than the Common chimpanzee and used to be called "Pygmy chimps" before Bonobos. They have redder lips, are more slender and their faces are black. Females also have very large clitorises which makes sense given their common sexual behavior. Bonobos have a female dominated hierarchy, fighting is rare between males and females, males are fairly tolerant to young even those from other males, and they have an interesting sociosexual dynamic. Bonobos frequently use sexual behavior to promote bonding, after fights to sooth relationships and tension, between members of the same sex, and aside from humans they are the only other animal to engage in face-to-face sex. They are considered the "nicer" of the two species.

Contrastingly, the common chimpanzee can live in several social groups of all males, females with young, or both sexes. Males form a dominance hierarchy and tend to be very aggressive. They also do not exhibit the sociosexual relationships Bonobos have, but they do care for their young, play and have warm relationships with each other.

I linked this above, but the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](https://www.eva.mpg.de/3chimps/files/apes.htm) has an awesome table listing out their differences. I recommend giving it a look.

Both species are incredibly fascinating and there are a ton of articles out there if you're interested in learning more. I've shared really the bare minimum here because I am writing this comment and making pancakes, sausage, and bacon. :) I type a little between flipping. If you're into it, you might like /r/ScienceFacts or my [Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/fillsyourniche/?hl=en) which is all nature and facts about the organism in my photos.

<TEXT> Ecologist popping in here.

I can certainly understand why everyone is so upset, but this headline is really fishy (sorry, no pun intended). Polar bears are naturally solitary, as /u/Iamnotburgerking has stated. They actively avoid each other in the wild because they will cannibalize each other's cubs. [As far as I know it is male bears that do this](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/dramatic-footage-shows-polar-bear-cannibalizing-cub/), I'm not aware of females but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen - I haven't read about it. A heads up on that link, it does contain a video you may not want to watch of a male bear chasing down a cub, but the article describes males eating cubs. If that makes you uncomfortable the video doesn't start playing unless you click on it, so you can ignore it. I'm only using it as a source for my claim.

That being said, putting two females together will still be stressful though certainly not as stressful as with a male partner. I see from articles that the female who died was 21 and lived in the zoo for 20 years. She may be a little more used to company if she was raised in this situation, but that built in discomfort of being around another bear doesn't go away. That's part of the species and to assume it doesn't exist because they lived together for 20 years is incorrect. We have to remember bears are not humans and not even social which would change their dynamic greatly. If we were talking about animals that were social and lived together in groups, as many primates do or elephants or even wolves then this would be another story. 

PITA is anthropomorphizing these bears which can be very dangerous. Anthropomorphizing can lead to putting animals in stressful and dangerous situations because we assume they think and feel as we do, but in all honestly they don't. I can't stress enough that solitary animals together in a small enclosure is not healthy.

Another point to be made, a 21-year-old polar bear is a very old bear. On average polar bears [live 15-18 years in the wild](https://polarbearsinternational.org/polar-bears/polar-bear-faq/), and can live longer in captivity. That is not a guarantee they will and it doesn't take away from the fact that 21 is still quite old. Elderly animals get stressed much easier and their bodies have a harder time responding to that stress than a younger animal. This does not mean the bear was heart broken, it means her daily routine has been interrupted and she cannot cope with it. We have no way of knowing exactly what that bear was feeling and jumping to conclusions doesn't do anyone any good here. Least of all these polar bears if we continue to pair them up when they should be alone or honestly not in zoos at all. Polar bears have incredibly long ranges in the wild and keeping them in a relatively small enclosure is not healthy at all.

Finally, Sea World is not known for taking excellent care of its animals. :/ I won't speculate or jump to conclusions myself without knowing exactly what that enclosure was like and how the lives of those bears went, but knowing their work with Orcas I don't have a lot of faith in Sea World.

I know you guys are concerned and seem to love the bears. I understand. We have to think with clear heads here though. There are a lot of factors to consider in the death of this bear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A frill-necked lizard was featured on the reverse of the Australian 2-cent coin until 1991. Some folks keep them as pets.

These lizards are actually fairly large at 85 cm (2.79 ft) in total length. They flair their frills out like this when they are trying to scare off a predator to make themselves look larger. 

[National Geographic fun fact](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/frilled-lizard/):

Besides defense, this lizard's colorful frill may be used to help regulate body temperature.

[The babies are actually pretty cute!](http://rivista-cdn.reptilesmagazine.com/135105802.jpg?ver=1400005992)

Some folks even keep them as pets. Reptiles Magazine has a [Care Sheet](http://www.reptilesmagazine.com/Care-Sheets/Frilled-Lizard-Care-Sheet/) on them. </TEXT>

The discovery of planets orbiting double stars at close distances has sparked increasing scientific interest in determining whether Earth-analogues can remain habitable in such environments and how their atmospheric dynamics is influenced by the rapidly changing insolation. In this work we present results of the first three-dimensional numerical experiments of a water-rich planet orbiting a double star. We find that the periodic forcing of the atmosphere has a noticeable impact on the planets climate. Signatures of the forcing frequencies related to the planets as well as to the binarys orbital periods are present in a variety of climate indicators such as temperature and precipitation, making the interpretation of potential observables challenging. However, for Earth-like greenhouse gas concentrations, the variable forcing does not change the range of insolation values allowing for habitable climates substantially. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist flying in.

While hummingbirds enter torpor in the evening (a short form of hibernation), this poor thing has definitely gone on to meet its maker. Hummingbirds are prone to heart attack given their accelerated heart rate and metabolism. It is also especially likely right now as we are in full swing for migration season. According to [this journal article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01920240?LI=true)

Small hummingbirds achieve the highest known mass-specific metabolic rates among vertebrate homeotherms.

That takes a toll on the heart and circulatory system. Adult humming birds of the species *Eupetomena macroura macroura* have resting heart rates of [428 to 460 beats per minute on the average](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.1091590402/full). Compared to the average adult human resting heart rate of [60 to 100 beats per minute](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/heart-rate/faq-20057979).

It could have also waited too long to get food, or could be injured from a fight. There are a lot of variables here.

Seriously though, there's nothing wrong with canon. First, calling things you don't like "autistic" is pretty lousy. Second, I love that the new media all fit together within the Universe. Why not bridge the gaps and create a cohesive storyline? It works just fine. Everything is timed out to work so yes "that shit can happen." </TEXT>

A scene in high contrast this thoughtful night skyscape is a modern composition inspired by M. C. Escher's lithograph Phosphorescent Sea. In it, bright familiar stars of Orion the Hunter and Aldebaran, eye of Taurus the Bull, hang in clear dark skies above a distant horizon. Below, faintly luminous edges trace an otherworldly constellation of patterns in mineral-crusted mud along the Uyuni Salt Flat of southwest Bolivia. The remains of an ancient lake, the Uyuni Salt Flat, Salar de Uyuni, is planet Earth's largest salt flat, located on the Bolivian Altiplano at an altitude of about 3,600 meters. Escher's 1933 lithograph also featured familiar stars in planet Earth's night, framing The Plough or Big Dipper above waves breaking on a more northern shore. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The relationship between dinosaurs and other reptiles is well established1, 2, 3, 4, but the sequence of acquisition of dinosaurian features has been obscured by the scarcity of fossils with transitional morphologies. The closest extinct relatives of dinosaurs either have highly derived morphologies5, 6, 7 or are known from poorly preserved8, 9 or incomplete material10, 11. Here we describe one of the stratigraphically lowest and phylogenetically earliest members of the avian stem lineage (Avemetatarsalia), Teleocrater rhadinus gen. et sp. nov., from the Middle Triassic epoch. The anatomy of T. rhadinus provides key information that unites several enigmatic taxa from across Pangaea into a previously unrecognized clade, Aphanosauria. This clade is the sister taxon of Ornithodira (pterosaurs and birds) and shortens the ghost lineage inferred at the base of Avemetatarsalia. We demonstrate that several anatomical features long thought to characterize Dinosauria and dinosauriforms evolved much earlier, soon after the birdcrocodylian split, and that the earliest avemetatarsalians retained the crocodylian-like ankle morphology and hindlimb proportions of stem archosaurs and early pseudosuchians. Early avemetatarsalians were substantially more species-rich, widely geographically distributed and morphologically diverse than previously recognized. Moreover, several early dinosauromorphs that were previously used as models to understand dinosaur origins may represent specialized forms rather than the ancestral avemetatarsalian morphology. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Jurnal article link.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X17300638)

**Highlights**

* We estimate lunar core composition using geochemical constraints.
* We determine phase equilibria for three compositions in FeNiSC system.
* A low S and C core has a high temperature liquidus but remains partially molten over lunar history.
* A core with 0.5 wt% S and 0.375 wt% C might provide an explanation for lunar paleomagnetic and seismic data.
* Core composition is consistent with available geochemical and geophysical data.

**Abstract**

Multiple lines of geochemical and geophysical evidence suggest the Moon has a small metallic core, yet the composition of the core is poorly constrained. The physical state of the core (now or in the past) depends on detailed knowledge of its composition, and unfortunately, there is little available data on relevant multicomponent systems (i.e., FeNiSC) at lunar interior conditions. In particular, there is a dearth of phase equilibrium data to elucidate whether a specific core composition could help to explain an early lunar geodynamo and magnetic field intensities, or current solid inner core/liquid outer core states. We utilize geochemical information to estimate the Ni, S and C contents of the lunar core, and then carry out phase equilibria experiments on several possible core compositions at the pressure and temperature conditions relevant to the lunar interior. The first composition is 0.5 wt% S and 0.375 wt% C, based on S and C contents of Apollo glasses. A second composition contains 1 wt% each of S and C, and assumes that the lunar mantle experienced degassing of up to 50% of its S and C. Finally a third composition contains C as the dominant light element. Phase equilibrium experiments were completed at 1, 3 and 5 GPa, using piston cylinder and multi-anvil techniques. The first composition has a liquidus near 1550C and solidus near 1250C. The second composition has a narrower liquidus and solidus temperatures of 1400 and 1270C, respectively, while the third composition is molten down to 1150C. As the composition crystallizes, the residual liquid becomes enriched in S and C, but S enrichment is greater due to the incorporation of C (but not S) into solid metallic FeNi. Comparison of these results to thermal models for the Moon allow an evaluation of which composition is consistent with the geophysical data of an early dynamo and a currently solid inner and liquid outer core. Composition 1 has a high enough liquidus to start crystallizing early in lunar history (4.3 Ga), consistent with the possible core dynamo initiated by crystallization of a solid inner core. Composition 1 also stays partially molten throughout lunar history, and could easily explain the seismic data. Composition 2, on the other hand, can satisfy one or the other set of geophysical data, but not both and thus seems like a poor candidate for a lunar core composition. Composition 3 remains molten to temperatures that are lower than current estimates for the lunar core, thus ruling out the possibility of a C-rich (and S-poor) lunar core. The S- and C-poor core composition studied here (composition 1) is consistent with all available geochemical and geophysical data and provides a simple heat source and mechanism for a lunar core dynamo (core crystallization) that would obviate the need for other primary mechanisms such as impacts, coremantle coupling, or unusual thermal histories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've posted this before here, but in case some folks missed it.

He did a great job with what he was given. He didn't want to act Vader the way Lucas wanted him to.
Taken from the book "The Complete Vader":

However Christensen soon expressed dismay over certain aspects of the Episode II screenplay. In a 2005 Rolling Stone interview, Lucas recalled, "[Christensen] said, 'I don't want to be this whiny kid.' I said, 'Well you are. You gotta be a whiny teenager.' He said, 'I want to be Darth Vader.' I said, 'You gotta be a petulant young Jedi. You're not going to be the guy you thought you'd be when you signed your contract.'

There's another paragraph I remember reading, but can't find, where Hayden mentioned he wanted to bring that seriousness and darkness out in Anakin and Lucas fought him on that too preferring the whiny teen angst angle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This behavior is so odd because normally octopuses are pouncers.

According to Dr. Roy Caldwell at U.C. Berkeley who studies this species:

Octopuses typically pounce on their prey or poke around in holes until they find something. When this octopus sees a shrimp at a distance, it compresses itself and creeps up, extends an arm up and over the shrimp, touches it on the far side and either catches it or scares it into its other arms.

For more information please see Berkeley's press release [here](http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/08/12/octopus-shows-unique-hunting-social-and-sexual-behavior/).

I love cephalopods in general and have commented on them many times before. They are incredibly fascinating animals and their camouflage is amazing which we don't see much of in this gif, but I've talked about ti before in other posts.

Cephalopods can change the color *and* texture of their skin! It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells that reflect light and hold pigment and are found just below the skin. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and some insects also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a small sack full of pigment (black, brown, orange, red or yellow) which can stretch. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear more dull. Aside from chromatophores some cephalopods also have [iridophores](http://en.termwiki.com/EN/iridiophore) and [leucophores](http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2646). Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates which create iridescent colors (greens, blues, silvers and golds) which you can see in [this photo](http://www.the-scientist.com/images/February2013/Fig1A_Loligo-Overview---pic-from-Grayson-Hanlon.jpg) of *[Loligo paeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longfin_inshore_squid)*. Leucophores mirror back the colors of the environment, helping the animal blend in with its surroundings.

Aside from mesmerizing prey and camouflage cephalopod colors are also used to attract mates and warn potential predators or rivals that the organism should not be messed with. For example male Caribbean reef squid (*[Sepioteuthis sepioidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_reef_squid)*) turn red to attract females and white to repel other males. Interestingly they can actually [split the coloration of their bodies down the middle to attract a female on one side and repel a male on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YViRSgYys1o). Another example, Humboldt (*[Dosidicus gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_squid)*) [squid will flash red and white to warn predators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NDwGAeHnyQ).

There was a [study in 2015](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/2/161.2) where scientists strapped cameras onto Humboldt squid to try to decode the communication. I didn't see anything super conclusive in the article, but I would assume they are working on it. It's a really great topic.

Some cephalopods can change the texture of their skin by manipulating [muscular hydrostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat). Hydrostats can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. [Our tongues have muscular hydrostats which allow us to stretch it out.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopus-arms-human-tongues-intertwine-for-science/) According to a [paper published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.20221/abstract):

The octopuses [in the study] had three dedicated types of muscles that control their on-call skin protrusions, or papillae. One set are shaped in concentric circles to lift the skin vertically away from the body. Another set pulls this form together, to determine the shapewhether it will be a round bump or tall spike.

New Scientist has a blurb about it [here](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15420771.600-frog-defies-gravity/). Here is Wikipedia's page on [Magnetic Levitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_levitation) for more information.

[Dr Geim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Geim) is the only scientist to win both a Nobel Prize (his is in Physics) as well as an Ig Nobel Prize.

I'm not familiar with this part of Physics beyond the very basics, so I'm afraid I can't really field any questions, but if we have any physicists in the sub today please pop in and start a discussion! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This behavior is so odd because normally octopuses are pouncers.

According to Dr. Roy Caldwell at U.C. Berkeley who studies this species:

Octopuses typically pounce on their prey or poke around in holes until they find something. When this octopus sees a shrimp at a distance, it compresses itself and creeps up, extends an arm up and over the shrimp, touches it on the far side and either catches it or scares it into its other arms.

For more information please see Berkely's press release [here](http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/08/12/octopus-shows-unique-hunting-social-and-sexual-behavior/).

I love cephalopods in general and have commented on them many times before. They are incredibly fascinating animals and their camouflage is amazing which we don't see much of in this gif, but I've talked about ti before in other posts.

Cephalopods can change the color *and* texture of their skin! It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells that reflect light and hold pigment and are found just below the skin. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and some insects also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a small sack full of pigment (black, brown, orange, red or yellow) which can stretch. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear more dull. Aside from chromatophores some cephalopods also have [iridophores](http://en.termwiki.com/EN/iridiophore) and [leucophores](http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2646). Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates which create iridescent colors (greens, blues, silvers and golds) which you can see in [this photo](http://www.the-scientist.com/images/February2013/Fig1A_Loligo-Overview---pic-from-Grayson-Hanlon.jpg) of *[Loligo paeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longfin_inshore_squid)*. Leucophores mirror back the colors of the environment, helping the animal blend in with its surroundings.

Aside from mesmerizing prey and camouflage cephalopod colors are also used to attract mates and warn potential predators or rivals that the organism should not be messed with. For example male Caribbean reef squid (*[Sepioteuthis sepioidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_reef_squid)*) turn red to attract females and white to repel other males. Interestingly they can actually [split the coloration of their bodies down the middle to attract a female on one side and repel a male on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YViRSgYys1o). Another example, Humboldt (*[Dosidicus gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_squid)*) [squid will flash red and white to warn predators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NDwGAeHnyQ).

There was a [study in 2015](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/2/161.2) where scientists strapped cameras onto Humboldt squid to try to decode the communication. I didn't see anything super conclusive in the article, but I would assume they are working on it. It's a really great topic.

Some cephalopods can change the texture of their skin by manipulating [muscular hydrostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat). Hydrostats can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. [Our tongues have muscular hydrostats which allow us to stretch it out.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopus-arms-human-tongues-intertwine-for-science/) According to a [paper published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.20221/abstract):

The octopuses [in the study] had three dedicated types of muscles that control their on-call skin protrusions, or papillae. One set are shaped in concentric circles to lift the skin vertically away from the body. Another set pulls this form together, to determine the shapewhether it will be a round bump or tall spike. And a third group seems to pull the raised section back toward the surface, spreading out its base.

More on that in [this Scientific American article](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/how-the-octopus-creates-instant-3-d-camouflage-on-its-skin/).

<TEXT> Ecologist climbing in! These are [Spurelli's leaf frogs or gliding tree frogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliding_tree_frog) (*Agalychnis spurrelli*) as the gif states. 

I see the video is a .ch, so taken in Switzerland which does not have tree frogs of this species. Gliding tree frogs are found in Central America and northern areas of South America. 

While I am not familiar with this species specifically, I know [wood frogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_frog) (*Lithobates sylvaticus*) have some [pretty serious orgies](http://gizmodo.com/wood-frog-mating-is-a-competitive-watery-orgy-1704284178) when they come out of hibernation. Other species of tropical tree frog also gather together as males scramble to find females. There was a Planet Earth episode on a species of flying tree frogs that showed this that Snoop Dogg [did some commentary on for Plizzanet Earth](http://latenightfeud.com/video/plizzanet-earth-with-snoop-dogg-tree-frogs/). It was the [episode](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074tgb) on Jungles.

User Glazed_BEagle also mentioned the struggle male tree frogs have to find the highest spot in order to call for females. This is also a very likely scenario and I believe what's happening in the gif. I wish it wasn't so short! [Here's a video he provided.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxYPi8p8YYk). I completely forgot about this behavior, I'm getting old. :) So a big thank you to him.

As climate change dries out more areas that were once wet, amphibians are projected to suffer the greatest casualties. Frogs need moist environments to mate, lay their eggs and then for their tadpoles to progress into adults. Sir David Attenborough discusses their fragility in this video [*Rare frogs   endangered species*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lWQLd5U0g8). 

For more information, the US Forest Service has a great article [*Amphibians and Climate Change*](https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/topics/amphibians-and-climate-change).

To help you can look into amphibian conservation groups such as [Amphibians.org](http://www.amphibians.org/) or  the [Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project](http://amphibianrescue.org/). There are usually volunteer opportunities with your state and local conservation groups as well.  </TEXT>

Taken from the book "The Complete Vader": 

However Christensen soon expressed dismay over certain aspects of the Episode II screenplay.

<TEXT> No one is reducing other species to feel more important. Please read the article links provided. The article specifically mentions territory, mating and predators. It didn't mention being social for an enjoyment aspect. Do fish enjoy being around each other? Yes, some species do, but in this context, that's not what's being discussed in the journal article or news article. Some fish have reduced stress levels when in groups. It's hard to know if this is really similar to our happiness. 

Frankly, it's offensive you would even say that. I'm an ecologist, I study animal behavior for a living. Non-human animals are fascinating and complex, no matter the species. I have great respect for the natural world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many animals are more social than most folks give them credit for. It's important to note humans are not special when it comes to wanting to be around each other or other species.

Also important to know that this article isn't necessarily saying the fish are being social or engaged with each other. The calls blend together like a terrestrial rainforest at dawn. All those birds are not singing to each other out of mutual enjoyment, but to claim territory, communicate predator locations or find a mate. This mostly says the coral reef is the rainforest and the fish are the birds of the reef system. </TEXT>

The nest is close to a wooden foot bridge and easy to photograph without disturbing them. Hopefully, this is the nest they stay at, sometimes they make a few before deciding. I'll see what's up this coming week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist chomping in. Bush scissors, very creative! Piranha are some fairly serious fish, but not the monsters we usually think they are.

There are about 20 species of piranha and [many are actually pretty docile](https://msu.edu/~torresm2/piranhabehavior.html)! The aggressive species we usually think of is the [Red-bellied piranha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-bellied_piranha) (*Pygocentrus nattereri*) ([here's a photo of our friend](http://bransonswildworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Piranha.jpg)). Their bad reputation comes from the U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt who went on an expedition to South America in 1913. According to [the Smithsonian Institute](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/14-fun-facts-about-piranhas-180951948/) he said this about piranha:

They are the most ferocious fish in the world. Even the most formidable fish, the sharks or the barracudas, usually attack things smaller than themselves. But the piranhas habitually attack things much larger than themselves. They will snap a finger off a hand incautiously trailed in the water; they mutilate swimmersin every river town in Paraguay there are men who have been thus mutilated; they will rend and devour alive any wounded man or beast; for blood in the water excites them to madness. They will tear wounded wild fowl to pieces, and bite off the tails of big fish as they grow exhausted when fighting after being hooked.

[Mental Floss wrote](http://mentalfloss.com/article/50356/how-teddy-roosevelt-turned-piranhas-ferocious-maneaters) about the locals fancying the situation up for Teddy by demonstrating piranhas eating a cow carcass. They caught a bunch before he arrived, kept them in a tank without feeding them, then tossed a dead cow into the river.

All that being said they do have a pretty impressive bite force, National Geographic has [a video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIWdFDLBzbY) where they measure the bite force of one species.  Not something I'd want to trim any part of my body with! Gregory Erickson of Florida State University measured several bite forces in crocodilians and determined the most powerful bite recorded from a living animal belongs to the [saltwater crocodile](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/s/saltwater-crocodile/) (*Crocodylus porosus*) (as of 2012) with a bite force of 16,414N.

Continuing on that line of thought there is an extinct species of giant piranhas, *Megapiranha paranensis*that were up to 3ft (1m) long with an estimated bite force of 1,240-4,749N. All of this bite force information comes from a BBC news article you might like to read called [*One creature had a bite more powerful than any other*](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160817-one-creature-had-a-bite-more-powerful-than-any-other). It gives the bite force of several interesting species, including Great White sharks and Hyenas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Full and free journal article.](http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674\(17\)30344-6)

**Highlights**

* Unlike other taxa, cephalopods diversify their proteomes extensively by RNA editing
* Extensive recoding is specific to the behaviorally complex coleiods
* Unlike mammals, cephalopod recoding is evolutionarily conserved and often adaptive
* Transcriptome diversification comes at the expense of slowed-down genome evolution

**Summary**
RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and transcriptome plasticity highlights the importance of RNA recoding as a strategy for diversifying proteins, particularly those associated with neural function. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist swimming in. This is so adorable.

Dolphins are very intelligent and one of the few animals to pass the ["Mirror test"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test) which helps to determine if an animal is self-aware (important distinction, it can give a positive but not a negative. If an animal fails the test it does not necessarily mean it is not self-aware). The test was done on [Bottlenose Dolphins](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/bottlenose-dolphin/) and not this species, which looks like a [Dusky dolphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusky_dolphin) (*Lagenorhynchus obscurus*). Don't be fooled by the "smile", it's just the shape of the mouth and not an indicator of pleasure. [Here's the journal article](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/10/5937.full?sid=418d7011-efc6-4c7f-b45c-3e35c1918e95) for the Bottlenose dolphin test.

Play is an important part of many animals' lives as it helps them develop skills that are important for survival in a safe and enjoyable way. Many, many species play and some are kind of surprising. Science News had a fun write-up about surprising animals [here](https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/five-surprising-animals-play). If you check out the article, I loved the crocodilian examples. 

Back to dolphins though! This guy or gal is ["Bow Riding"](http://www.dolphindock.com.au/behaviours/bow-riding/) or using the wave the boat creates as propulsion. This is very common, though that doesn't take away from how fun it looks no matter how many videos or gifs I've seen. :) Dolphins also sometimes play with whales! They'll hitch rides on the whale's back or the whale will lift the dolphin into the air. [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC3AkGSigrA) explaining the behavior and a [news article about it](http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/15712/20150718/dolphins-riding-whales-exactly-new.htm).

Another note on dolphins, which I'll never get over how amazing this is, is that some species have been documented having "names" or specific signature whistles all their own. Here is the [National Geographic article](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/07/130722-dolphins-whistle-names-identity-animals-science/) and a quote about the study:

The research was performed by a group of scientists on a boat off eastern Scotland who joined up with a group of wild dolphins. When one of the dolphins announced itself with its signature whistlethe equivalent of "Joey!" for instancethe researchers recorded that sound.

Later, the team played that same "Joey!" call back to the dolphins, and a significant portion of the time, the dolphin they called Joey responded with the same callas if Joey was saying, "Yup, I'm here."

Nat Geo said the journal article was published in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, but I haven't been able to dig it up yet. I'll try to find it for those interested.

<TEXT> Beautiful photo! 

This beautiful bioluminescence is caused by [phytoplankton](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/phyto.html). There are two main classes of phytoplankton; [dinoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate) and [diatoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom). Dinoflagellates are our bioluminescent phytoplankton! A common species is the [*Noctiluca scintillans*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctiluca_scintillans), commonly known as the sea tinkle (I know, it's adorable). [Here's what it looks like up close](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/64/94/e9/6494e9f7bab8586dccae2f15c44cc7e8.jpg).
The bioluminescence is produced throughout the cytoplasm by a [luciferin-luciferase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin#Dinoflagellate) reaction in organelles called [scintillons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate#Bioluminescence).  

As I am sure you know, some marine animals also bioluminesce! Common examples are:

*  the squid [*Abralia veranyi*](http://ocean.si.edu/sites/default/files/styles/blog_photo/public/photos/2.09_P08_G10_Abraliabigger.jpg?itok=KYQhDjVX)
* various species of [lantern fish](http://biolum.eemb.ucsb.edu/organism/pictures/myctophid1.jpg)
* [angler fish species](http://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/984/135/50544_1_1280x720_640x360_177552451962.jpg)
* [googly eyed glass squid](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lm0f9j7AQA1qin08mo1_500.jpg) (*Teuthowenia pellucida*)
* [vampire squid](https://media.giphy.com/media/s62zb1ouMjHxK/giphy.gif) (*Vampyroteuthis infernalis*)
* many many jellyfish or jellies (both words are still used, obviously they are not fish); [*Aequorea victoria*](http://www.dmlim.net/img/aeq/RaskoffAequorea.jpg), [*Aurelia aurita*](https://1nlbgh367fhx33e65vxs7rl8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Moon-JellyFish.jpg), [*Bolinopsis infundibulum*](http://68.media.tumblr.com/312506db6d05e9ce8962a26f9bac91fd/tumblr_nviwvrGW1K1ue1k7zo1_1280.jpg), etc.

For more information on bioluminescence check out [Smithsonain's page on it](http://ocean.si.edu/bioluminescence).

These guys are literally !

**Summary:**

Subterranean biodiversity in Europe is spectacularly rich, with the Western Balkans being home to about 400 cave species, representing the highest number of species per area worldwide [1] . Nonetheless, cave fishes, which are the most commonly found vertebrates in underground habitats [2] , have not been described from Europe so far [3] . Here, we report the first European record of a cave fish population, a loach of the genus Barbatula ( Figure 1 ), found in the DanubeAach system, an underground karst water system in Southern Germany [4] . The fish exhibit traits typically observed in organisms adapted to subterranean life including reduced eyes and pale body coloration [5] . The newly discovered population also represents globally the northernmost cave fish found so far. The geological history of the region implies that the DanubeAach system was colonized post-glacially. A recent origin of the cave fish is supported by genetic analyses, because the subterranean population shares COI gene haplotypes with adjacent surface stone loach (Barbatula barbatula) populations ( Figure 1 D). Nonetheless, population genetic analyses based on microsatellites indicated that cave fish are genetically isolated from populations in surface habitats ( Figure 1 E) and exhibit reduced genetic variability. Hence, the newly discovered European cave loaches do not represent individuals displaced from surface populations, but they follow a unique evolutionary trajectory towards cave life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dead horse is so dead. Which is a shame because horses are beautiful and fascinating animals.  Their eye placement allows them to see nearly 360 degrees around them. Pretty handy as a prey animal, though they don't have a lot to worry about in this age. They can also [sleep lying down and standing up](http://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/how-many-animals-can-sleep-standing).

Horses' teeth take up more space in there heads thn their brains, as an [adult horses brain weights 22 oz](http://www.theequinest.com/random-horse-facts/) - about half that of a human.  

According to the [American Museum of Natural History](http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/horse/the-evolution-of-horses/) the earliest known horses evolved 55 million years ago and for much of this time, multiple horse species lived at the same time, often side by side.

<TEXT> Ecologist pawing in. Trash pandas are adorable! Those hands are pretty freaky though.

Those creepy digits are very dextrous and while their thumbs are not opposable they do look quite humanlike as they have five digits. They are great graspers, can open jars, turn handles and lift lids with little issue.

Raccoons ([*Procyon lotor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon)) are members of family [*Procyonidae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procyonidae) which they share with coatis, ringtails and several other beautiful animals but with harder to spell names on mobile. ;) [According to PBS](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/raccoon-nation-raccoon-fact-sheet/7553/)  the English word raccoon is an adaptation of a native Powhatan word meaning animal that scratches with its hands.

Raccoons are nocturnal and frequent visitors to our trash cans and bird feeders. In the wild they'd normally travel several miles in one evening, but we've made things easier on them in urban and suburban areas.     

Raccoons are not super long lived in the wild, living to about 2 or 3 years, but they can live up to [13 years in captivity](http://wdfw.wa.gov/living/raccoons.html) or up to 20 depending on a few others websites. They are primarily solitary, but will come together if there is an abundance of food. 

If you're a raccoon fan check out Planet Earth II. They were featured in the urban environment episode. A female was teaching her cubs how to get along in people's yards. It was adorable!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are around 6,000 species in family [Nymphalidae](http://bugguide.net/node/view/192) and while many do feed on rotting fruit, animal carcasses, dung, mud and sap, not all do. Some still feed on nectar from flowers or a combination of food sources. Their diet is about as varied as their habitats and species! Some are brightly colored like [*Morpho didius*](https://www.butterfliesandthings.com/images/company_assets/1c9376c1-3b43-4475-b17c-9384f32f7ec8/product_catalog/Mor210-Morpho-didius-didius-5.JPG), some are well camouflaged like [*Kallima inachus*](http://www.learnaboutbutterflies.com/Kallima%20inachus%200451-001a.jpg), some are mimics, etc. You can't really generalize an entire family that is broken up into so many species.

 They are a remarkable family though. [Interestingly, sub-family Heliconiinae collect pollen in their proboscises and absorb its proteins.](http://www.toledo-bend.us/index.asp?bfly4_info) There's a lot of weird, neat stuff going on out there!

<TEXT> The full and free journal article [*A new tyrannosaur with evidence for anagenesis and crocodile-like facial sensory system*](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep44942).

**Abstract:**

A new species of tyrannosaurid from the upper Two Medicine Formation of Montana supports the presence of a Laramidian anagenetic (ancestor-descendant) lineage of Late Cretaceous tyrannosaurids. In concert with other anagenetic lineages of dinosaurs from the same time and place, this suggests that anagenesis could have been a widespread mechanism generating species diversity amongst dinosaurs, and perhaps beyond. We studied the excellent fossil record of the tyrannosaurid to test that hypothesis. Phylogenetic analysis places this new taxon as the sister species to Daspletosaurus torosus. However, given their close phylogenetic relationship, geographic proximity, and temporal succession, where D. torosus (~76.775.2Ma) precedes the younger new species (~75.174.4Ma), we argue that the two forms most likely represent a single anagenetic lineage. Daspletosaurus was an important apex predator in the late Campanian dinosaur faunas of Laramidia; its absence from later units indicates it was extinct before Tyrannosaurus rex dispersed into Laramidia from Asia. In addition to its evolutionary implications, the texture of the facial bones of the new taxon, and other derived tyrannosauroids, indicates a scaly integument with high tactile sensitivity. Most significantly, the lower jaw shows evidence for neurovasculature that is also seen in birds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Science Journal Article [*The role of infrequent and extraordinary deep dives in leatherback turtles \(Dermochelys coriacea\)*](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/16/2566).

Article summary for the busy:

Infrequent and exceptional behaviours can provide insight into the ecology and physiology of a particular species. Here we examined extraordinarily deep (3001250 m) and protracted (1h) dives made by critically endangered leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the context of three previously suggested hypotheses: predator evasion, thermoregulation and exploration for gelatinous prey. Data were obtained via satellite relay data loggers attached to adult turtles at nesting beaches (N=11) and temperate foraging grounds (N=2), constituting a combined tracking period of 9.6 years (N=26,146 dives) and spanning the entire North Atlantic Ocean. Of the dives, 99.6% (N=26,051) were to depths 300 m with only 0.4% (N=95) extending to greater depths (subsequently termed `deep dives'). Analysis suggested that deep dives: (1) were normally distributed around midday; (2) may exceed the inferred aerobic dive limit for the species; (3) displayed slow vertical descent rates and protracted durations; (4) were much deeper than the thermocline; and (5) occurred predominantly during transit, yet ceased once seasonal residence on foraging grounds began. These findings support the hypothesis that deep dives are periodically employed to survey the water column for diurnally descending gelatinous prey. If a suitable patch is encountered then the turtle may cease transit and remain within that area, waiting for prey to approach the surface at night. If unsuccessful, then migration may continue until a more suitable site is encountered. Additional studies using a meta-analytical approach are nonetheless recommended to further resolve this matter. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

**Summary**
Background   aims
Legumes, a low-energy, nutrient-dense and low glycemic index food, have shown beneficial effects on glycemic control and adiposity. As such, legumes are widely recommended in diabetic diets, even though there is little evidence that their consumption protects against type 2 diabetes. Therefore the aim of the present study was to examine the associations between consumption of total legumes and specific subtypes, and type 2 diabetes risk. We also investigated the effect of theoretically substituting legumes for other protein- or carbohydrate-rich foods.

**Methods**
Prospective assessment of 3349 participants in the PREvencin con DIeta MEDiterrnea (PREDIMED) study without type 2 diabetes at baseline. Dietary information was assessed at baseline and yearly during follow-up. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for type-2 diabetes incidence according to quartiles of cumulative average consumption of total legumes, lentils, chickpeas, dry beans and fresh peas.

**Results**
During a median follow-up of 4.3 years, 266 new cases of type 2 diabetes occurred. Individuals in the highest quartile of total legume and lentil consumption had a lower risk of diabetes than those in the lowest quartile (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.96; P-trend = 0.04; and HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.460.98; P-trend = 0.05, respectively). A borderline significant association was also observed for chickpeas consumption (HR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.46, 1.00; P-trend = 0.06). Substitutions of half a serving/day of legumes for similar servings of eggs, bread, rice or baked potato was associated with lower risk of diabetes incidence.

**Conclusions**
A frequent consumption of legumes, particularly lentils, in the context of a Mediterranean diet, may provide benefits on type 2 diabetes prevention in older adults at high cardiovascular risk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For anyone interested, here is the full and free journal article [*A new tyrannosaur with evidence for anagenesis and crocodile-like facial sensory system*](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep44942).

**Abstract:**

A new species of tyrannosaurid from the upper Two Medicine Formation of Montana supports the presence of a Laramidian anagenetic (ancestor-descendant) lineage of Late Cretaceous tyrannosaurids. In concert with other anagenetic lineages of dinosaurs from the same time and place, this suggests that anagenesis could have been a widespread mechanism generating species diversity amongst dinosaurs, and perhaps beyond. We studied the excellent fossil record of the tyrannosaurid to test that hypothesis. Phylogenetic analysis places this new taxon as the sister species to Daspletosaurus torosus. However, given their close phylogenetic relationship, geographic proximity, and temporal succession, where D. torosus (~76.775.2Ma) precedes the younger new species (~75.174.4Ma), we argue that the two forms most likely represent a single anagenetic lineage. Daspletosaurus was an important apex predator in the late Campanian dinosaur faunas of Laramidia; its absence from later units indicates it was extinct before Tyrannosaurus rex dispersed into Laramidia from Asia. In addition to its evolutionary implications, the texture of the facial bones of the new taxon, and other derived tyrannosauroids, indicates a scaly integument with high tactile sensitivity. Most significantly, the lower jaw shows evidence for neurovasculature that is also seen in birds. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

We analyze a radius bone fragment of a raven (Corvus corax) from Zaskalnaya VI rock shelter, Crimea. The object bears seven notches and comes from an archaeological level attributed to a Micoquian industry dated to between 38 and 43 cal kyr BP. Our study aims to examine the degree of regularity and intentionality of this set of notches through their technological and morphometric analysis, complemented by comparative experimental work. Microscopic analysis of the notches indicate that they were produced by the to-and-fro movement of a lithic cutting edge and that two notches were added to fill in the gap left between previously cut notches, probably to increase the visual consistency of the pattern. Multivariate analysis of morphometric data recorded on the archaeological notches and sets of notches cut by nine modern experimenters on radii of domestic turkeys shows that the variations recorded on the Zaskalnaya set are comparable to experimental sets made with the aim of producing similar, parallel, equidistant notches. Identification of the Weber Fraction, the constant that accounts for error in human perception, for equidistant notches cut on bone rods and its application to the Zaskalnaya set of notches and thirty-six sets of notches incised on seventeen Upper Palaeolithic bone objects from seven sites indicate that the Zaskalnaya set falls within the range of variation of regularly spaced experimental and Upper Palaeolithic sets of notches. This suggests that even if the production of the notches may have had a utilitarian reason the notches were made with the goal of producing a visually consistent pattern. This object represents the first instance of a bird bone from a Neanderthal site bearing modifications that cannot be explained as the result of butchery activities and for which a symbolic argument can be built on direct rather than circumstantial evidence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Science Blog's article [*Why would a leatherback turtle dive 1000m deep?*](http://scienceblogs.com/deepseanews/2008/08/08/why-do-leatherback-turtles-div/).

Science Journal Article [*The role of infrequent and extraordinary deep dives in leatherback turtles \(Dermochelys coriacea\)*](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/16/2566).

Article summary for the busy:

Infrequent and exceptional behaviours can provide insight into the ecology and physiology of a particular species. Here we examined extraordinarily deep (3001250 m) and protracted (1h) dives made by critically endangered leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the context of three previously suggested hypotheses: predator evasion, thermoregulation and exploration for gelatinous prey. Data were obtained via satellite relay data loggers attached to adult turtles at nesting beaches (N=11) and temperate foraging grounds (N=2), constituting a combined tracking period of 9.6 years (N=26,146 dives) and spanning the entire North Atlantic Ocean. Of the dives, 99.6% (N=26,051) were to depths 300 m with only 0.4% (N=95) extending to greater depths (subsequently termed `deep dives'). Analysis suggested that deep dives: (1) were normally distributed around midday; (2) may exceed the inferred aerobic dive limit for the species; (3) displayed slow vertical descent rates and protracted durations; (4) were much deeper than the thermocline; and (5) occurred predominantly during transit, yet ceased once seasonal residence on foraging grounds began. These findings support the hypothesis that deep dives are periodically employed to survey the water column for diurnally descending gelatinous prey. If a suitable patch is encountered then the turtle may cease transit and remain within that area, waiting for prey to approach the surface at night. If unsuccessful, then migration may continue until a more suitable site is encountered. Additional studies using a meta-analytical approach are nonetheless recommended to further resolve this matter. </TEXT>

The difference here is tens of thousands of years ago when the herpes virus was coming together as we know it now humans a. were very different than we are now culturally, b. very likely did not keep other primates as pets and c. were in competition with other apes for resources. I can't imagine trying to have sex (for many reasons) with a wild ape of any kind. Their strength is so much greater than ours it would be incredibly dangerous.  

Really the likelihood of this being sexually transmitted is immensely unlikely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [NASA's explanation of the image:
](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170328.html)
This rock structure is not only surreal -- it's real. The reason it's not more famous is that it is, perhaps, smaller than one might guess: the capstone rock overhangs only a few meters. Even so, the King of Wings outcrop, located in New Mexico, USA, is a fascinating example of an unusual type of rock structure called a hoodoo. Hoodoos may form when a layer of hard rock overlays a layer of eroding softer rock. Figuring out the details of incorporating this hoodoo into a night-sky photoshoot took over a year. Besides waiting for a suitably picturesque night behind a sky with few clouds, the foreground had to be artificially lit just right relative to the natural glow of the background. After much planning and waiting, the final shot, featured here, was taken in May 2016. Mimicking the horizontal bar, the background sky features the band of our Milky Way Galaxy stretching overhead. </TEXT>

I would have either left it alone or transported it to shade. Depending on the temperature of that water it could be extremely jarring to get suddenly covered in cold.

<TEXT> Snakes sun themselves in the morning to warm up, they need the Sun's energy as they cannot produce heat on their own (they are [ectothermic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectotherm)). So if you are out on a hike I'd keep an eye on sunny spots along the trail. Otherwise, they really want nothing to do with us! Most snakes flee as soon as you get too close. Know the species in your area that are potentially harmful and just be vigilant. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist slithering in! Usually I'm more of an insect or bird commenter, but I have a lot of respect and love for our reptile friends as well. I owned quite a few snake species and enjoyed catching them when I was a young girl.

It's always cobras and they are always in the most inconvenient of places! Living in the Northeastern United States the worst I deal with are [Copperheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agkistrodon_contortrix), very rarely [Water Moccasins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agkistrodon_piscivorus) depending on where I am or maybe if I'm lucky to see one, a Timber rattlesnake.

I can't imagine what it's like dealing with cobras all the time and because of the rat population in local towns how easy it is to find them in common places. Cobras are also [religiously worshiped or revered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81ga) in parts of India by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains, so that would also aid in their more robust urban population. Luckily for this overheated guy or gal they've got some friends here!

[King Cobras](http://indialookup.in/king-cobra/) (*Ophiophagus hannah*) can get up to a length of about 18 feet! They're beautiful, but I'm not sure I'd really want to handle one. King cobras are incredibly helpful animals as they mainly prey upon other cobras and are generally not super aggressive towards humans.

According to WalkthroughIndia.com [20,000 people in India die](http://www.walkthroughindia.com/wildlife/the-6-most-venomous-snakes-in-india/) due to venomous snake bites each year. It's a difficult number to digest, but remember as of 2016 India had a population of [well over 1 billion people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_India).

The Indian Subcontinent is so plagued by snake bite fatalities they have [*The Big Four*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(Indian_snakes\)) who cause the most snake bite cases each year. 

* [Indian cobra, *Naja naja*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cobra)
* [Common krait, *Bungarus caeruleus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_krait)
* [Russell's viper, *Daboia russeliil*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_viper)
* [Saw-scaled viper, *Echis carinatus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echis_carinatus)

If bites weren't enough, there are also [spitting cobras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting_cobra)! So no worries if you're out of range of a strike you could always get venom sent directly to your eyes. These are some cobras of the genus [*Naja*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naja) which have fangs that have a rifled opening which allows the venom to propel or spray from the fangs instead of the usual injection. Some species "spit" their venom as far as 6.6 ft (2 m).

I am making a note here because I see this confusion a lot: venomous animals inject venom and poisonous animals need to be ingested (or skin contact for some species) to do harm.

If venomous is not your thing they also have nearly 10 foot long [Indian Pythons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_molurus) (*Python molurus*). Again due to their rat problems this would not be too uncommon to find hiding under someone's home.

I love snakes, they get kind of a bad rep, but honestly they are just trying to live their lives like the rest of us. We just make it either a little harder or a little easier depending on the circumstances.       

If you love science you might enjoy /r/Sciencefacts which is sort of a TIL for science only. :) I'll have to add some snake facts after seeing all of this love!           

I also post nature photos on Instagram and Twitter from @fillsyourniche with facts relating to the organism if you're into that sort of thing. With Spring here should be a lot of new photos soon!              

Edit - A few users have mentioned King Cobras' signature growl! Awesome work, team. [Here is a video to listen to.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7uubQH-Hzc)   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist swimming into this very popular repost. Great photos!

I really love the deep sea stuff and have a BS in Marine and Environmental Biology and Policy. Though working more with birds and arthropods after my BS, I love returning to my Marine Biology roots. :)

Here's the run-down of animals in the photos:

1. A type of chimera shark ([Order Chimaeriformes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimaera))
2. Sea spider ([Class Pycnogonida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_spider))
3. [Black scabbardfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_scabbardfish) (*Aphanopus carbo*)
4. Grenadier also called Rattail  [\(Family Macrouridae\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenadiers_\(fish\))
5. Is my favorite, some kind of Lumpsucker [Family Cyclopteridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpsucker)
6. Looks like a [*Lophius* spp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lophius) angler fish

<TEXT> An interesting quote from the news article:

"It's important to understand the role that wolves play in ecosystems and to not assume that smaller predators ... perform the same ecological functions," Benson said. "If coyotes start hammering white-tailed deer, and deer start to decline, then (coyotes) can just eat rabbits or squirrels or garbage but continue to prey on deer, too. So we think that could be a destabilizing element.

It's important to remember when an animal is no longer a major player in an ecosystem that vacuum needs to be filled and it doesn't always fill with the best choice. Large predators such as wolves are incredibly important when it comes to controlling the population of large herbivores which in turn control the populations of plant life and plant biodiversity which can completely change the ecological landscape. 

Every organism is so intimately connected, it's a house of cards. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Understanding the ecological roles of species that influence ecosystem processes is a central goal of ecology and conservation biology. Eastern coyotes (Canis latrans) have ascended to the role of apex predator across much of eastern North America since the extirpation of wolves (Canis spp.) and there has been considerable confusion regarding their ability to prey on ungulates and their ecological niche relative to wolves. Eastern wolves (C. lycaon) are thought to have been the historical top predator in eastern deciduous forests and have previously been characterized as deer specialists that are inefficient predators of moose because of their smaller size relative to gray wolves (C. lupus). We investigated intrinsic and extrinsic influences on per capita kill rates of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and moose (Alces alces) during winter by sympatric packs of eastern coyotes, eastern wolves, and admixed canids in Ontario, Canada to clarify the predatory ability and ecological roles of the different canid top predators of eastern North America. Eastern coyote ancestry within packs negatively influenced per capita total ungulate (deer and moose combined) and moose kill rates. Furthermore, canids in packs dominated by eastern coyote ancestry consumed significantly less ungulate biomass and more anthropogenic food than packs dominated by wolf ancestry. Similar to gray wolves in previous studies, eastern wolves preyed on deer where they were available. However, in areas were deer were scarce, eastern wolves killed moose at rates similar to those previously documented for gray wolves at comparable moose densities across North America. Eastern coyotes are effective deer predators, but their dietary flexibility and low kill rates on moose suggest they have not replaced the ecological role of wolves in eastern North America. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The importance of understanding the geographic distribution of the full annual cycle of migratory birds has been increasingly highlighted over the past several decades. However, the difficulty of tracking small birds between breeding and wintering areas has hindered progress in this area. To learn more about Kirtland's warbler Setophaga kirtlandii movement patterns throughout the annual cycle, we deployed archival light-level geolocators across their breeding range in Michigan. We recovered devices from 27 males and analyzed light-level data within a Bayesian framework. We found that most males wintered in the central Bahamas and exhibited a loop migration pattern. In both fall and spring, departure date was the strongest predictor of arrival date, but in spring, stopover duration and migration distance were also important. Though stopover strategies varied, males spent the majority of their spring migration at stopover sites, several of which were located just before or after large ecological barriers. We argue that loop migration is likely a response to seasonal variation in prevailing winds. By documenting a tight link between spring departure and arrival dates, we provide a plausible mechanism for previously documented carry-over effects of winter rainfall on reproductive success in this species. The migratory periods remain the least understood periods for all birds, but by describing Kirtland's warbler migration routes and timing, and identifying locations of stopover sites, we have begun the process of better understanding the dynamics of their full annual cycle. Moreover, we have provided managers with valuable information on which to base future conservation and research priorities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist swimming in. I love this gif! I've seen it all over Reddit and it never gets old.

Cardinalfish (family [Apogonidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogonidae)) swallow [ostracods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracod) accidentally while looking for plankton. They are herbivorous and not really into snacking on crustaceans. To avoid being digested the ostracods evolved a pretty amazing defense; lighting up which brings full attention to whatever just swallowed them. Since the cardinalfish is translucent (which is usually beneficial in the dark depths), their glowing bodies make them easy targets for predators. Once the fish lights up it spits out the ostracod to save itself from predation.

A bit about our friends the ostrocods: bioluminescent light is produced as the result of a chemical reaction, typically the oxidation of a photon-emitting compound known as [luciferin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin). Some ostracods have a light organ which produces the luciferin known as coelenterazine. More on bioluminescence in [this *How Stuff Works* article](http://animals.howstuffworks.com/animal-facts/bioluminescence2.htm).

There was a decent article from Gizmodo on this video [here](http://gizmodo.com/what-kind-of-demon-sorcery-created-this-laser-spitting-1631483648/1631636301). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist jumping in. Cheetahs are so beautiful and probably my favorite big cat.

[Cheetahs](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/cheetah/) are pretty scary, but out of the big cats of Africa I'd much rather be face to face with a cheetah.

The cheetah is the only living (extant) member of its genus, *[Acinonyx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinonyx)*. These beautiful cats are generally friendlier towards humans than the other big cats. This may be due to their smaller size (77 to 143 lbs vs 265 to 420 lbs [African lion](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/african-lion/?source=A-to-Z)!) and that we are nothing like the fast moving prey they are used to hunting. If you don't run (act like prey) they likely won't treat you like prey. And if you do run, cheetahs can reach a top burst speed of 70 mph so good luck!

Cheetahs also have [non-retractable claws](https://susieweeksphotography.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/16-cheetah-claws.jpg). This means they stay out all the time, like a dog or wolf's claws. You can see in the photo they are sharp, but much blunter than say [a lion's claws](https://christiansperka.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/20130513-cs2_0028-e-sig.jpg) (you can see the claw sheath clearly in the photo, just like your house cat's!). They lose some of that edge by constantly being out and worn down as the cat walks or runs.

Cheetahs become pretty friendly with their handlers when in zoos and seem to do well in big cat sanctuaries. Around 1700 B.C., ancient Egyptians became [the first to tame the cheetahs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah#Taming). They were used by Pharaohs as hunting companions. This is not to say they would make good pets! No big cats should ever be pets. They're wild and unpredictable and even zookeepers get mauled on occasion. It only takes one cheetah tantrum to lose a hand or worse.

All that being said, it is certainly not unheard of for people to be attacked by cheetahs:

Poor [Adam Sandler](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2360372/Adam-Sandler-attacked-cheetah-African-safari-I-thought-I-going-die.html) bent down near a watering hole which seemed to trigger a predatory response in a cheetah while he was visiting Africa.

And a [woman who was working at a big cat conservation center](http://www.today.com/id/23914554/ns/today-today_ncheetah ews/t/cheetah-mauling-victim-says-she-assumed-risk/#.VaAYE_m6f-s) was mauled in 2008. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Journal article link.](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/12/E2385.abstract)

**Abstract:**

The origins of the five groups of living seed plants, including the single relictual species Ginkgo biloba, are poorly understood, in large part because of very imperfect knowledge of extinct seed plant diversity. Here we describe well-preserved material from the Early Cretaceous of Mongolia of the previously enigmatic Mesozoic seed plant reproductive structure Umaltolepis, which has been presumed to be a ginkgophyte. Abundant new material shows that Umaltolepis is a seed-bearing cupule that was borne on a stalk at the tip of a short shoot. Each cupule is umbrella-like with a central column that bears a thick, resinous, four-lobed outer covering, which opens from below. Four, pendulous, winged seeds are attached to the upper part of the column and are enclosed by the cupule. Evidence from morphology, anatomy, and field association suggests that the short shoots bore simple, elongate Pseudotorellia leaves that have similar venation and resin ducts to leaves of living Ginkgo. Umaltolepis seed-bearing structures are very different from those of Ginkgo but very similar to fossils described previously as Vladimaria. Umaltolepis and Vladimaria do not closely resemble the seed-bearing structures of any living or extinct plant, but are comparable in some respects to those of certain Peltaspermales and Umkomasiales (corystosperms). Vegetative similarities of the Umaltolepis plant to Ginkgo, and reproductive similarities to extinct peltasperms and corystosperms, support previous ideas that Ginkgo may be the last survivor of a once highly diverse group of extinct plants, several of which exhibited various degrees of ovule enclosure. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Bone strength is influenced by bone geometry, density, and bone microarchitecture, which adapt to increased mechanical loads during growth. Physical activity (PA) is essential for optimal bone strength accrual; however, less is known about how sedentary time influences bone strength and its determinants. Thus, our aim was to investigate the prospective associations between PA, sedentary time, and bone strength and its determinants during adolescence. We used HR-pQCT at distal tibia (8% site) and radius (7% site) in 173 girls and 136 boys (aged 9 to 20 years at baseline). We conducted a maximum of four annual measurements at the tibia (n=785 observations) and radius (n=582 observations). We assessed moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and sedentary time with accelerometers (ActiGraph GT1M). We aligned participants on maturity (years from age at peak height velocity) and fit a mixed-effects model adjusting for maturity, sex, ethnicity, leg muscle power, lean mass, limb length, dietary calcium, and MVPA in sedentary time models. MVPA was a positive independent predictor of bone strength (failure load [F.Load]) and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) at the tibia and radius, total area (Tt.Ar) and cortical porosity (Ct.Po) at the tibia, and negative predictor of load-to-strength ratio at the radius. Sedentary time was a negative independent predictor of Tt.Ar at both sites and Ct.Po at the tibia and a positive predictor of cortical thickness (Ct.Th), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and cortical bone mineral density (Ct.BMD) at the tibia. Bone parameters demonstrated maturity-specific associations with MVPA and sedentary time, whereby associations were strongest during early and mid-puberty. Our findings support the importance of PA for bone strength accrual and its determinants across adolescent growth and provide new evidence of a detrimental association of sedentary time with bone geometry but positive associations with microarchitecture. This study highlights maturity-specific relationships of bone strength and its determinants with loading and unloading. Future studies should evaluate the dose-response relationship and whether associations persist into adulthood.  2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist flying in. I love the reference!

Crows are highly intelligent birds and with that intelligence comes a need for stimulation. So aside from stealing food, they sometimes exhibit behaviors like this for amusement. They get bored, just like we get bored or any other animal with free time not devoted to foraging, mating or sleeping.

Crows are frequently seen doing silly things to keep themselves amused. For instance:

[Rolling down a snowy car's windshield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ta33bMB70)

**Abstract:**

Theria comprises all but three living mammalian genera and is one of the most ecologically pervasive clades on Earth. Yet, the origin and early history of therians and their close relatives (i.e., cladotherians) remains surprisingly enigmatic. A critical biological function that can be compared among early mammal groups is mastication. Morphometrics and modeling analyses of the jaws of Mesozoic mammals indicate that cladotherians evolved musculoskeletal anatomies that increase mechanical advantage during jaw rotation around a dorsoventrally-oriented axis (i.e., yaw) while decreasing the mechanical advantage of jaw rotation around a mediolaterally-oriented axis (i.e., pitch). These changes parallel molar transformations in early cladotherians that indicate their chewing cycles included significant transverse movement, likely produced via yaw rotation. Thus, I hypothesize that cladotherian molar morphologies and musculoskeletal jaw anatomies evolved concurrently with increased yaw rotation of the jaw during chewing cycles. The increased transverse movement resulting from yaw rotation may have been a crucial evolutionary prerequisite for the functionally versatile tribosphenic molar morphology, which underlies the molars of all therians and is retained by many extant clades. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The influence of fission-fusion dynamics, i.e., temporal variation in group size and composition, on social complexity has been studied in large-brained mammals that rely on social bonds. Little is known about birds, even though some species like ravens have recently received attention for their socio-cognitive skills and use of social bonds. While raven breeders defend territories year-round, non-breeders roam through large areas and form groups at food sources or night roosts. We here examined the fission-fusion patterns of non-breeding ravens over years, investigating whether birds meet repeatedly either at the same or at different locations. We combined four large datasets: presence-absence observations from two study sites (Austria, Italy) and GPS-tracking of ravens across two study areas (Austria, France). As expected, we found a highly dynamic system in which individuals with long phases of temporary settlement had a high probability of meeting others. Although GPS-tagged ravens spread out over thousands of square kilometres, we found repeated associations between almost half of the possible combinations at different locations. Such a system makes repeated interactions between individuals at different sites possible and likely. High fission-fusion dynamics may thus not hinder but shape the social complexity of ravens and, possibly, other long-term bonded birds. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

In the setting of profound ocular blindness, numerous lines of evidence demonstrate the existence of dramatic anatomical and functional changes within the brain. However, previous studies based on a variety of distinct measures have often provided inconsistent findings. To help reconcile this issue, we used a multimodal magnetic resonance (MR)-based imaging approach to provide complementary structural and functional information regarding this neuroplastic reorganization. This included gray matter structural morphometry, high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) of white matter connectivity and integrity, and resting state functional connectivity MRI (rsfcMRI) analysis. When comparing the brains of early blind individuals to sighted controls, we found evidence of co-occurring decreases in cortical volume and cortical thickness within visual processing areas of the occipital and temporal cortices respectively. Increases in cortical volume in the early blind were evident within regions of parietal cortex. Investigating white matter connections using HARDI revealed patterns of increased and decreased connectivity when comparing both groups. In the blind, increased white matter connectivity (indexed by increased fiber number) was predominantly left-lateralized, including between frontal and temporal areas implicated with language processing. Decreases in structural connectivity were evident involving frontal and somatosensory regions as well as between occipital and cingulate cortices. Differences in white matter integrity (as indexed by quantitative anisotropy, or QA) were also in general agreement with observed pattern changes in the number of white matter fibers. Analysis of resting state sequences showed evidence of both increased and decreased functional connectivity in the blind compared to sighted controls. Specifically, increased connectivity was evident between temporal and inferior frontal areas. Decreases in functional connectivity were observed between occipital and frontal and somatosensory-motor areas and between temporal (mainly fusiform and parahippocampus) and parietal, frontal, and other temporal areas. Correlations in white matter connectivity and functional connectivity observed between early blind and sighted controls showed an overall high degree of association. However, comparing the relative changes in white matter and functional connectivity between early blind and sighted controls did not show a significant correlation. In summary, these findings provide complimentary evidence, as well as highlight potential contradictions, regarding the nature of regional and large scale neuroplastic reorganization resulting from early onset blindness. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being used globally to conserve marine resources. However, whether many MPAs are being effectively and equitably managed, and how MPA management influences substantive outcomes remain unknown. We developed a global database of management and fish population data (433 and 218 MPAs, respectively) to assess: MPA management processes; the effects of MPAs on fish populations; and relationships between management processes and ecological effects. Here we report that many MPAs failed to meet thresholds for effective and equitable management processes, with widespread shortfalls in staff and financial resources. Although 71% of MPAs positively influenced fish populations, these conservation impacts were highly variable. Staff and budget capacity were the strongest predictors of conservation impact: MPAs with adequate staff capacity had ecological effects 2.9 times greater than MPAs with inadequate capacity. Thus, continued global expansion of MPAs without adequate investment in human and financial capacity is likely to lead to sub-optimal conservation outcomes. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Research has indicated that many video games are saturated with stereotypes of women and that these contents may cultivate sexism. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between video game exposure and sexism for the first time in a large and representative sample. Our aim was also to measure the strength of this association when two other significant and well-studied sources of sexism, television exposure and religiosity, were also included in a multivariate model. A representative sample of 13520 French youth aged 1119 years completed a survey measuring weekly video game and television exposure, religiosity, and sexist attitudes toward women. Controlling for gender and socioeconomic level, results showed that video game exposure and religiosity were both related to sexism. Implications of these results for future research on sexism in video games are discussed. </TEXT>

I'm on mobile so I'll find other sources later, but [this link here](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Doubts_about_behavior_gorillas_coast) is a discussion about this behavior (and this video is linked) by a primatologist graduate student (in 2016 who had been studying them since 2009, specifically behavior) who mentions the spinning as play.

Thank you for your concern!  

Edit - 

[Primate Info Net](http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/aboutp/behavior/gorillas2.html) has an entire list from several published journal articles about gorilla behavior. Spinning is listed under play in several papers within this giant list.

Here is a paper called [*Play Behavior in Infant Western Lowland Gorillas
\(Gorilla gorilla gorilla\) at the Lincoln Park Zoo*](http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1153 context=uhp_theses) which mentions spinning in infants on page 14.

[Daily Mail article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3538040/Is-new-Prima-te-Ballerina-Incredible-moment-young-gorilla-dances-perfect-pirouette-inside-enclosure.html) about a juvenile spinning for play. While the Daily Mail is total garbage, they do have quotes from the zookeepers.

[A news article about the same gorilla](http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/video-gorilla-dancing-twycross-zoo-gets-viewed/story-29106263-detail/story.html), again with quotes from the primate keeper at the zoo. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Demographic data on wild chimpanzees are crucial for understanding the evolution of chimpanzee and hominin life histories, but most data come from populations affected by disease outbreaks and anthropogenic disturbance. We present survivorship data from a relatively undisturbed and exceptionally large community of eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. We monitored births, deaths, immigrations, and emigrations in the community between 1995 and 2016. Using known and estimated ages, we calculated survivorship curves for the whole community, for males and females separately, and for individuals 2 years old when identified. We used a novel method to address age estimation error by calculating stochastic survivorship curves. We compared Ngogo life expectancy, survivorship, and mortality rates to those from other chimpanzee communities and human hunter-gatherers. Life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 32.8 years, far exceeding estimates of chimpanzee life expectancy in other communities, and falling within the range of human hunter-gatherers (i.e., 2737 years). Overall, the pattern of survivorship at Ngogo was more similar to that of human hunter-gatherers than to other chimpanzee communities. Maximum lifespan for the Ngogo chimpanzees, however, was similar to that reported at other chimpanzee research sites and was less than that of human-hunter gatherers. The absence of predation by large carnivores may contribute to some of the higher survivorship at Ngogo, but this cannot explain the much higher survivorship at Ngogo than at Kanyawara, another chimpanzee community in the same forest, which also lacks large carnivores. Higher survivorship at Ngogo appears to be an adaptive response to a food supply that is more abundant and varies less than that of Kanyawara. Future analyses of hominin life history evolution should take these results into account.

**Abstract:**

Cyanogenesis denotes a chemical defensive strategy where hydrogen cyanide (HCN, hydrocyanic or prussic acid) is produced, stored, and released toward an attacking enemy. The high toxicity and volatility of HCN requires both chemical stabilization for storage and prevention of accidental self-poisoning. The few known cyanogenic animals are exclusively mandibulate arthropods (certain myriapods and insects) that store HCN as cyanogenic glycosides, lipids, or cyanohydrins. Here, we show that cyanogenesis has also evolved in the speciose Chelicerata. The oribatid mite Oribatula tibialis uses the cyanogenic aromatic ester mandelonitrile hexanoate (MNH) for HCN storage, which degrades via two different pathways, both of which release HCN. MNH is emitted from exocrine opisthonotal oil glands, which are potent organs for chemical defense in most oribatid mites. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is frequently confusion when deciding on the pluralization of animal names given scientists use both Greek and Latin. 

There is a similar issue with Octopus pluralization, which is *octopuses* not *octopi* if you want to be grammatically correct. Even *octopodes* is better than *octopi* because you are not mixing the Greek word *Octopus* with a Latin plural *Octopi*. The English plural is *Octopuses* and the Greek plural is *Octopodes*.

Statins have been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol levels and cardiovascular events in large outcome trials, findings that have made them the therapeutic cornerstone of clinical practice.1 Despite the proven efficacy of statins, there is considerable variability in individual responses to these drugs.2 Furthermore, some observational data suggest that as many as half of persons who begin statin therapy discontinue it within a year.3 Moreover, among patients receiving statin therapy who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease and who have persistent elevation of LDL cholesterol levels, the rates of cardiovascular events remain high, necessitating the development of additional therapies.
The discovery that the serine protease proprotein convertase subtilisinkexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes the degradation of the LDL receptor affords an additional route through which LDL cholesterol levels in plasma can be controlled.4 Initial therapeutic approaches to reducing circulating levels of PCSK9 have focused on the use of monoclonal antibodies. This approach sequesters virtually all PCSK9 in the reticuloendothelial system, thus preventing it from binding to the LDL receptor.5,6 Circulating PCSK9 is derived almost entirely from the liver7; hence, therapeutic approaches that target hepatic production of PCSK9 may offer an alternative to the use of monoclonal antibodies.
RNA interference and related RNA silencing pathways provide an opportunity to harness a highly specific endogenous mechanism for regulating gene expression.8 Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) selectively and catalytically silence the translation of their complementary target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in a sequence-specific manner through the formation of effector RNA-induced silencing complexes.9,10 Inclisiran is an investigational, chemically synthesized siRNA molecule that has produced sustained hepatocyte-specific, PCSK9-specific RNA silencing in healthy volunteers to 84 days after administration.11 Here, we present the results of the phase 2 ORION-1 trial, a dose-finding trial evaluating the efficacy of different inclisiran dosing regimens among patients who have elevated LDL cholesterol levels despite receiving the maximum possible dose of a statin and who are considered to be at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Within the limits of the trial, we also evaluated the safety and efficacy of inclisiran in lowering LDL cholesterol levels. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

**Background**
Obtaining population-level estimates of the incidence and prevalence of dementia is challenging due to under-diagnosis and under-reporting. We investigated the feasibility of using multiple linked datasets and capturerecapture techniques to estimate rates of dementia among women in Australia.

**Methods**
This work is based on the Australian Longitudinal Study on Womens Health. A random sample of 12,432 women born in 19211926 was recruited in 1996. Over 16 years of follow-up records of dementia were obtained from five sources: three-yearly self-reported surveys; clinical assessments for aged care assistance; death certificates; pharmaceutical prescriptions filled; and, in three Australian States only, hospital in-patient records.

**Results**
A total of 2534 women had a record of dementia in at least one of the data sources. The aged care assessments included dementia records for 79.3% of these women, while pharmaceutical data included 34.6%, death certificates 31.0% and survey data 18.5%. In the States where hospital data were available this source included dementia records for 55.8% of the women. Using capturerecapture methods we estimated an additional 728 women with dementia had not been identified, increasing the 16 year prevalence for the cohort from 20.4 to 26.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.2, 26.8%).

**Conclusions**
This study demonstrates that using routinely collected health data with record linkage and capturerecapture can produce plausible estimates for dementia prevalence and incidence at a population level. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

A more anteriorly positioned foramen magnum evolved in concert with bipedalism at least four times within Mammalia: once in macropodid marsupials, once in heteromyid rodents, once in dipodid rodents, and once in hominoid primates. Here, we expand upon previous research on the factors influencing mammalian foramen magnum position (FMP) and angle with four new analyses. First, we quantify FMP using a metric (basioccipital ratio) not previously examined in a broad comparative sample of mammals. Second, we evaluate the potential influence of relative brain size on both FMP and foramen magnum angle (FMA). Third, we assess FMP in an additional rodent clade (Anomaluroidea) containing bipedal springhares (Pedetes spp.) and gliding/quadrupedal anomalures (Anomalurus spp.). Fourth, we determine the relationship between measures of FMP and FMA in extant hominoids and an expanded mammalian sample. Our results indicate that bipedal/orthograde mammals have shorter basioccipitals than their quadrupedal/non-orthograde relatives. Brain size alone has no discernible effect on FMP or FMA. Brain size relative to palate size has a weak influence on FMP in some clades, but effects are not evident in all metrics of FMP and are inconsistent among clades. Among anomaluroids, bipedal Pedetes exhibits a more anterior FMP than gliding/quadrupedal Anomalurus. The relationship between FMA and FMP in hominoids depends on the metric chosen for quantifying FMP, and if modern humans are included in the sample. However, the relationship between FMA and FMP is nonexistent or weak across rodents, marsupials, and, to a lesser extent, strepsirrhine primates. These results provide further evidence that bipedal mammals tend to have more anteriorly positioned foramina magna than their quadrupedal close relatives. Our findings also suggest that the evolution of FMP and FMA in hominins may not be closely coupled.

**Abstract:**

The anterior position of the human foramen magnum is often explained as an adaptation for maintaining balance of the head atop the cervical vertebral column during bipedalism and the assumption of orthograde trunk postures. Accordingly, the relative placement of the foramen magnum on the basicranium has been used to infer bipedal locomotion and hominin status for a number of Mio-Pliocene fossil taxa. Nonetheless, previous studies have struggled to validate the functional link between foramen magnum position and bipedal locomotion. Here, we test the hypothesis that an anteriorly positioned foramen magnum is related to bipedalism through a comparison of basicranial anatomy between bipeds and quadrupeds from three mammalian clades: marsupials, rodents and primates. Additionally, we examine whether strepsirrhine primates that habitually assume orthograde trunk postures exhibit more anteriorly positioned foramina magna compared with non-orthograde strepsirrhines. Our comparative data reveal that bipedal marsupials and rodents have foramina magna that are more anteriorly located than those of quadrupedal close relatives. The foramen magnum is also situated more anteriorly in orthograde strepsirrhines than in pronograde or antipronograde strepsirrhines. Among the primates sampled, humans exhibit the most anteriorly positioned foramina magna. The results of this analysis support the utility of foramen magnum position as an indicator of bipedal locomotion in fossil hominins. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The evolutionary reasons for variation in nose shape across human populations have been subject to continuing debate. An import function of the nose and nasal cavity is to condition inspired air before it reaches the lower respiratory tract. For this reason, it is thought the observed differences in nose shape among populations are not simply the result of genetic drift, but may be adaptations to climate. To address the question of whether local adaptation to climate is responsible for nose shape divergence across populations, we use QstFst comparisons to show that nares width and alar base width are more differentiated across populations than expected under genetic drift alone. To test whether this differentiation is due to climate adaptation, we compared the spatial distribution of these variables with the global distribution of temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity. We find that width of the nares is correlated with temperature and absolute humidity, but not with relative humidity. We conclude that some aspects of nose shape may indeed have been driven by local adaptation to climate. However, we think that this is a simplified explanation of a very complex evolutionary history, which possibly also involved other non-neutral forces such as sexual selection. </TEXT>

**Highlights**

* -Aging quantifies determinants of individuals appearing younger/older than peers
* TMEM106B and GRN variants interact genetically in the regulation of -aging
* The role of TMEM106B in aging appears CNS region and life-stage selective
* TMEM106B modulates CNS inflammatory and degenerative changes independently of disease

**Summary**
Human age-associated traits, such as cognitive decline, can be highly variable across the population, with some individuals exhibiting traits that are not expected at a given chronological age. Here we present differential aging (-aging), an unbiased method that quantifies individual variability in age-associated phenotypes within a tissue of interest, and apply this approach to the analysis of existing transcriptome-wide cerebral cortex gene expression data from several cohorts totaling 1,904 autopsied human brain samples. We subsequently performed a genome-wide association study and identified the TMEM106B and GRN gene loci, previously associated with frontotemporal dementia, as determinants of -aging in the cerebral cortex with genome-wide significance. TMEM106B risk variants are associated with inflammation, neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits, even in the absence of known brain disease, and their impact is highly selective for the frontal cerebral cortex of older individuals (65 years). The methodological framework we describe can be broadly applied to the analysis of quantitative traits associated with aging or with other parameters. </TEXT>

I see you edited your "Doctor heal thyself" bit out. I have no stake in this, I don't have children and will likely not have children.

<TEXT> One *possible* take-home seems to be people without children face deficits in support towards the end of their lives and having children keeps that issue at bay. Having a child take care of you leads to a longer lifespan.

**A reminder to please keep on topic**, whether or not you personally want children is not relevant to the discussion about this study.

Full and free journal article [*Payback time? Influence of having children on mortality in old age*](http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2017/01/30/jech-2016-207857).

**Abstract:**

**Background** It is known that parents have lower mortality than childless individuals. Support from adult children to ageing parents may be of importance for parental health and longevity. The aim of this study was to estimate the association between having a child and the risk of death, and to examine whether the association increased at older ages when health starts to deteriorate and the need of support from a family member increases.

**Methods** In this nationwide study, all men and women (born between 1911 and 1925 and residing in Sweden), as well as their children, were identified in population registers and followed over time. Age-specific death risks were calculated for each calendar year for individuals having at least one child and for individuals without children. Adjusted risk differences and risk ratios were estimated.

**Results** Men and women having at least one child experienced lower death risks than childless men and women. At 60 years of age, the difference in life expectancy was 2 years for men and 1.5 years for women. The absolute differences in death risks increased with parents' age and were somewhat larger for men than for women. The association persisted when the potential confounding effect of having a partner was taken into account. The gender of the child did not matter for the association between parenthood and mortality.

**Conclusions** Having children is associated with increased longevity, particularly in an absolute sense in old age. That the association increased with parents' age and was somewhat stronger for the non-married may suggest that social support is a possible explanation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is the safe assumption, I agree. The article mentions that the more the chick begs the more attention it receives until the adult has reached a level of stress that is its maximum; triggering the selfish response. So still appropriate parents, but there is a limit.

There are plenty of organisms though that do sacrifice themselves to save their offspring during stressful times, but generally they do not have more than one or two chances to reproduce within their lifetime which isn't the case with auks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Full and free journal article link.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10336-016-1382-y)

**Abstract:**

Long-lived seabirds are good models to study the mechanisms that mediate the parentoffspring interactions. Contrary to studies under natural conditions, experimental manipulations allow us to assess the birds reactions in a short time period. We used the stress hormone corticosterone as an independent experimental factor to simulate the stress reaction, to examine changes in the behaviour of Little Auk chicks and parent birds. In the first experiment, we hypothesised that after enhancement of the corticosterone level Little Auk (Alle alle) chicks intensify their begging performance and attain a higher pre-fledging body mass than the control chicks. In the second experiment, we hypothesized that parent Little Auks with an increased corticosterone level feed their chicks less frequently and spend less time at the colony than their untreated partners and the control birds. We also expected that chicks with one parent implanted with corticosterone fledge later and with a lower body mass than chicks of two untreated parents. The obtained results supported the above hypotheses. We demonstrated that modification of begging performance in Little Auks constitutes an adaptive mechanism that guards against the decrease in the chicks body condition during stressful periods. Even though the provisioning rate in Little Auks can be regulated according to the chicks needs (expressed by the intensity of the begging display), it appears that adult birds regulate their provisioning strategy primarily according to their body state. The results suggest that parent Little Auks under stressful conditions will decrease their parental effort and redirect the available energy towards self-maintenance. The study provides novel insights into the behaviour of long-lived alcids using an experimental approach on free-living birds. </TEXT>

<TITLE> When parent little auks are stressed, they reduce offspring feeding and spend more time searching for themselves. If their own chance of survival is reduced due to food shortage or weather conditions they focus on themselves and spend more time looking for their own food than for their chick. </TITLE>

<TEXT> It's always okay to ask questions, never apologize for that!

It would not have happened anyway as we have moved past any natural warming cycles.

According to the [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/norock/science/retreat-glaciers-glacier-national-park?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects), retreat of this magnitude is due to global climate change. The park has become a big focus on what climate change can do and is doing. 

While there would be a natural retreat and then advance in a cooling vs warming cycle, we have gone far beyond what we would consider normal based on past climate information gathered through ice and soil cores, records of oxygen isotopes, and other means. There's a wonderful Ted Talk [here](http://www.ted.com/talks/lee_hotz_inside_an_antarctic_time_machine) on ice core data I showed my students this week; I recommend it if you have 9 1/2 minutes to spare. It shows the effort scientists are going through to accumulate this type of data.

The [National Parks Service also has a great explanation here](https://www.nps.gov/glba/learn/nature/climate-change.htm).

[Here is another article](http://www.alternet.org/environment/why-glacier-national-park-poster-child-climate-change) with photos showing the difference over the years.          </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are several species of birds referred to as guillemots or murres. I am fairly certain the species pictured in the gif are [Common murres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_murre) (*Uria aalge*). This species has one chick at a time and once it hits the water the males will take care of the chick full time until it can go off on its own.


Eureka alert article [*Why guillemot chicks leap from the nest before they can fly*](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-03/mu-wgc030917.php).

Journal Article link for the article [*Variation in Growth Drives the Duration of Parental Care: A Test of Ydenbergs Model*](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/691097)

**Abstract:**

The duration of parental care in animals varies widely, from none to lifelong. Such variation is typically thought to represent a trade-off between growth and safety. Seabirds show wide variation in the age at which offspring leave the nest, making them ideal to test the idea that a trade-off between high energy gain at sea and high safety at the nest drives variation in departure age (Ydenbergs model). To directly test the model assumptions, we attached time-depth recorders to murre parents (fathers [which do all parental care at sea] and mothers;  of each). Except for the initial mortality experienced by chicks departing from the colony, the mortality rate at sea was similar to the mortality rate at the colony. However, energy gained by the chick per day was 2.1 times as high at sea compared with at the colony because the father spent more time foraging, since he no longer needed to spend time commuting to and from the colony. Compared with the mother, the father spent 2.6 times as much time diving per day and dived in lower-quality foraging patches. We provide a simple model for optimal departure date based on only (1) the difference in growth rate at sea relative to the colony and (2) the assumption that transition mortality from one life-history stage to the other is size dependent. Apparently, large variation in the duration of parental care can arise simply as a result of variation in energy gain without any trade-off with safety. </TEXT>

Good question, and one that researchers are still trying to answer. They know Cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and cuttlefish) match their skin to their surroundings using their eyesight. But whats perplexing is that octopuses are actually colorblind. Its possible they can distinguish between different polarization of light better than humans can, but the exact method for how they identify color is unknown.

<TEXT> It's not a learned behavior, so very unlikely we will ever naturally form this adaptation. Frogs and toads are unique in having rods with two different sensitivities, which is not found in any other vertebrates. 

Given frogs and toads are frequently found in dark crevices, burrows, dens, passages, etc. it is imperative they can find their way out in what we would perceive as total darkness. We do not have the same environmental stressors to cause this type of adaptation. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The presence of two spectrally different kinds of rod photoreceptors in amphibians has been hypothesized to enable purely rod-based colour vision at very low light levels. The hypothesis has never been properly tested, so we performed three behavioural experiments at different light intensities with toads (Bufo) and frogs (Rana) to determine the thresholds for colour discrimination. The thresholds of toads were different in mate choice and prey-catching tasks, suggesting that the differential sensitivities of different spectral cone types as well as task-specific factors set limits for the use of colour in these behavioural contexts. In neither task was there any indication of rod-based colour discrimination. By contrast, frogs performing phototactic jumping were able to distinguish blue from green light down to the absolute visual threshold, where vision relies only on rod signals. The remarkable sensitivity of this mechanism comparing signals from the two spectrally different rod types approaches theoretical limits set by photon fluctuations and intrinsic noise. Together, the results indicate that different pathways are involved in processing colour cues depending on the ecological relevance of this information for each task. </TEXT>

[NASA's page about the photo.](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170310.html) Explanation:

The galaxies of Abell 2666 lie far beyond the Milky Way, some 340 million light-years distant toward the high flying constellation Pegasus. Framed in this sharp telescopic image, the pretty cluster galaxies are gathered behind scattered, spiky, Milky Way stars. At cluster center is giant elliptical galaxy NGC 7768, the central dominant galaxy of the cluster. As the cluster forms, such massive galaxies are thought to grow by mergers of galaxies that fall through the center of the cluster's gravitational well. Typical of dominant cluster galaxies, NGC 7768 likely harbors a supermassive black hole. At the estimated distance of Abell 2666, this cosmic frame would span about 5 million light-years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll let OP answer the meat of your question, but there are parrot sanctuaries in many states if you are in the US. Some zoos will also take unwanted pet parrots, but I'm not sure where you are located to check. As an example, the [New England Exotic Wildlife Sanctuary](https://www.fosterparrots.com/) takes in parrots as does the [Popcorn Park Zoo](http://www.ahscares.org/page2.asp?page=popcornpark) in New Jersey, which takes any rescue animals from all kinds of situations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello and thank you so much for being here to speak with us today.


We've done something similar with wolves in Yellowstone in the past; replacing them with a close sub-species (Northern Rocky Mountainswolf(*Canis lupus irremotus*) vs the Mackenzie Valleywolf (*Canis lupus occidentalis*) though not the original to keep the ecosystem healthy. While I understand the difference between a species and sub-species is minimal, I'm glad to see it seems to be working well so far. 

Island ecosystems seem to be much more fragile however. How difficult is it choosing the correct fill in species? It's easy for non-natives to run amok.

Can you share some your successes and failures of these projects? 

You're doing fascinating work and now more than ever conservation should be on our minds. Thank you again for sharing with us today.    </TEXT>

Rays are absolutely beautiful animals! This is an awesome gif. Manta rays ([*Manta* spp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manta_ray)) are actually fairly gentle and do not have stingers like their smaller cousins the [stingrays](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/stingray/) (by smaller I mean not by a whole lot, [here's a story](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/03/150311-giant-stingray-largest-freshwater-fish-thailand-whiptail-animals/) about the largest freshwater stingray).

Mantas can get very large, such as the [Giant Oceanic Manta Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_oceanic_manta_ray) (*Manta birostris*) which can grow to 7 m (23 ft) and weigh about 1,350 kg (2,980 lb).

These beautiful, majestic animals are filter feeders ([here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c7PFsosGSk) of one feeding through a school of fish)! They do not have teeth, but instead [rows of tiny plates](https://a-z-animals.com/animals/manta-ray/) that funnel [plankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton) into their mouths as they move. [Here is a photo](http://otlibrary.com/wp-content/gallery/manta-ray/manta-ray-feeding-mouth-wide-open-maldives.jpg) of a Manta ray from the front, mouth open.

Mantas are found in the open ocean as well as along reefs; the [Reef manta ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reef_manta_ray) (*Manta alfredi*) being another large example growing up to 4 m (13 ft) and found, you guessed it, near coral reefs. Our big friends the Giant oceanic manta rays spend most of their lives far from the shores and out in the wider ocean and according to Wikipedia is associated with offshore oceanic islands (which was news to me, I was only aware of the outer ocean habitat). 

Manta rays are a great Eco-tourism resource and you can frequently swim with them as a part of vacation and cruise packages! I swam with a few in the Carribean and it was an experience I will never forget. They were very curious!

They do need our help as far as conservation goes and life will only get more difficult as we see Climate Change advance, so if you are interested in lending a hand please check out these resources:

<TEXT> Ecologist swimming by.

Those "feet" are actually the "penises", or [claspers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clasper), of the string ray. Through mating, the male inserts one clasper into her [cloaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca)(all purpose orifice for reproduction and waste removal) for insemination (having two makes it easier when you're floating/swimming, sharks have these as well). Usually, the male is a little smaller or the same size as the female as their mating attempts can be..well..vigorous..and you don't want to hurt the female. 

I've made a larger comment about rays in general in this post, but I'll add that comment here as well:

<TEXT> Larger Pacific striped octopus, missed a word in the title.

This behavior is so odd because normally octopuses are pouncers.

According to Dr. Roy Caldwell at U.C. Berkley who studies this species:

Octopuses typically pounce on their prey or poke around in holes until they find something. When this octopus sees a shrimp at a distance, it compresses itself and creeps up, extends an arm up and over the shrimp, touches it on the far side and either catches it or scares it into its other arms.

For more information please see Berkely's press release [here](http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/08/12/octopus-shows-unique-hunting-social-and-sexual-behavior/).

I love cephalopods in general and have commented on them many times before. They are incredibly fascinating animals and their camouflage is amazing which we don't see much of in this gif, but I've talked about ti before in other posts.

Cephalopods can change the color *and* texture of their skin! It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells that reflect light and hold pigment and are found just below the skin. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and some insects also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a small sack full of pigment (black, brown, orange, red or yellow) which can stretch. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear more dull. Aside from chromatophores some cephalopods also have [iridophores](http://en.termwiki.com/EN/iridiophore) and [leucophores](http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2646). Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates which create iridescent colors (greens, blues, silvers and golds) which you can see in [this photo](http://www.the-scientist.com/images/February2013/Fig1A_Loligo-Overview---pic-from-Grayson-Hanlon.jpg) of *[Loligo paeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longfin_inshore_squid)*. Leucophores mirror back the colors of the environment, helping the animal blend in with its surroundings.

Aside from mesmerizing prey and camouflage cephalopod colors are also used to attract mates and warn potential predators or rivals that the organism should not be messed with. For example male Caribbean reef squid (*[Sepioteuthis sepioidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_reef_squid)*) turn red to attract females and white to repel other males. Interestingly they can actually [split the coloration of their bodies down the middle to attract a female on one side and repel a male on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YViRSgYys1o). Another example, Humboldt (*[Dosidicus gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_squid)*) [squid will flash red and white to warn predators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NDwGAeHnyQ).

There was a [study in 2015](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/2/161.2) where scientists strapped cameras onto Humboldt squid to try to decode the communication. I didn't see anything super conclusive in the article, but I would assume they are working on it. It's a really great topic.

Some cephalopods can change the texture of their skin by manipulating [muscular hydrostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat). Hydrostats can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. [Our tongues have muscular hydrostats which allow us to stretch it out.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopus-arms-human-tongues-intertwine-for-science/) According to a [paper published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.20221/abstract):

The octopuses [in the study] had three dedicated types of muscles that control their on-call skin protrusions, or papillae. One set are shaped in concentric circles to lift the skin vertically away from the body. Another set pulls this form together, to determine the shapewhether it will be a round bump or tall spike. And a third group seems to pull the raised section back toward the surface, spreading out its base.

<TEXT> Technically it is the highest mountain above sea level, but not the tallest mountain on Earth!

Mount Everest has a peak of 8,850 meters (29,035 feet, this varies slightly by source) above sea level. No other mountain on Earth has a higher altitude. 

Other mountains are taller as taller means "the total vertical distance between their base and their summit."

[Mauna Kea](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/vis/visiting-mauna-kea/visiting-the-summit.html) is the tallest mountain on Earth (starting as an island) with an altitude of [4,205 meters (13,796 feet\)](http://geology.com/records/highest-mountain-in-the-world.shtml). Mauna Kea is over 10,000 meters tall compared to 8,850 meters for Mount Everest - making it the "world's tallest mountain."

<TEXT> Most solar radiation is absorbed by Earth's surface (48%) and the rest by the atmosphere (23%) ([NASA Source](http://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page4.php)). If the incoming solar radiation is greater than the outgoing solar radiation the Earth will continue its temperature increase. This will then result in an increase in the outgoing radiation (please refer to the[Stefan-Boltzman law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StefanBoltzmann_law) which states *outgoing radiation* increases faster than the temperature). The hotter the object, the more heat it puts off. Eventually the Earth will emit (outgoing) as much radiation as it is receiving and aradiative equilibriumwill be achieved.

Currently this is all kinds of borked due to greenhouse gases which are trapping the outgoing radiation and/or reflecting it back to the surface creating a feedback loop (in several ways).    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist swimming in. Cephalopod camouflage is awesome!

Cephalopods can change the color *and* texture of their skin! It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells that reflect light and hold pigment and are found just below the skin. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and some insects also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a small sack full of pigment (black, brown, orange, red or yellow) which can stretch. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear more dull. Aside from chromatophores some cephalopods also have [iridophores](http://en.termwiki.com/EN/iridiophore) and [leucophores](http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2646). Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates which create iridescent colors (greens, blues, silvers and golds) which you can see in [this photo](http://www.the-scientist.com/images/February2013/Fig1A_Loligo-Overview---pic-from-Grayson-Hanlon.jpg) of *[Loligo paeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longfin_inshore_squid)*. Leucophores mirror back the colors of the environment, helping the animal blend in with its surroundings.

Aside from mesmerizing prey and camouflage cephalopod colors are also used to attract mates and warn potential predators or rivals that the organism should not be messed with. For example male Caribbean reef squid (*[Sepioteuthis sepioidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_reef_squid)*) turn red to attract females and white to repel other males. Interestingly they can actually [split the coloration of their bodies down the middle to attract a female on one side and repel a male on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YViRSgYys1o). Another example, Humboldt (*[Dosidicus gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_squid)*) [squid will flash red and white to warn predators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NDwGAeHnyQ).

There was a [study in 2015](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/2/161.2) where scientists strapped cameras onto Humboldt squid to try to decode the communication. I didn't see anything super conclusive in the article, but I would assume they are working on it. It's a really great topic.

Some cephalopods can change the texture of their skin by manipulating [muscular hydrostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat). Hydrostats can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. [Our tongues have muscular hydrostats which allow us to stretch it out.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopus-arms-human-tongues-intertwine-for-science/) According to a [paper published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.20221/abstract):

The octopuses [in the study] had three dedicated types of muscles that control their on-call skin protrusions, or papillae. One set are shaped in concentric circles to lift the skin vertically away from the body. Another set pulls this form together, to determine the shapewhether it will be a round bump or tall spike. And a third group seems to pull the raised section back toward the surface, spreading out its base.

More on that in [this Scientific American article](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/how-the-octopus-creates-instant-3-d-camouflage-on-its-skin/).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> [NASA's picture explanation](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170223.html):

Seven worlds orbit the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, a mere 40 light-years away. In May 2016 astronomers using the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope (TRAPPIST) announced the discovery of three planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. Just announced, additional confirmations and discoveries by the Spitzer Space Telescope and supporting ESO ground-based telescopes have increased the number of known planets to seven. The TRAPPIST-1 planets are likely all rocky and similar in size to Earth, the largest treasure trove of terrestrial planets ever detected around a single star. Because they orbit very close to their faint, tiny star they could also have regions where surface temperatures allow for the presence of liquid water, a key ingredient for life. Their tantalizing proximity to Earth makes them prime candidates for future telescopic explorations of the atmospheres of potentially habitable planets. All seven worlds appear in this artist's illustration, an imagined view from a fictionally powerful telescope near planet Earth. Planet sizes and relative positions are drawn to scale for the Spitzer observations. The system's inner planets are transiting their dim, red, nearly Jupiter-sized parent star. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Summary for the busy:

 A new WCS study in India shows that three carnivores  tigers, leopards, and dholes (Asian wild dog)  seemingly in direct competition with one other, are living side by side with surprisingly little conflict. Usually, big cats and wild canids live in different locations to avoid each other.

Yet in four relatively small reserves in Indias wildlife-rich Western Ghats region, WCS researchers have found that they are co-existing, despite competing for much of the same prey, including sambar deer, chital, and pigs.


[Journal article link.](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1848/20161860)

**Abstract:**

Species within a guild vary their use of time, space and resources, thereby enabling sympatry. As intra-guild competition intensifies, such behavioural adaptations may become prominent. We assessed mechanisms of facilitating sympatry among dhole (*Cuon alpinus*), leopard (*Panthera pardus*) and tiger (*Panthera tigris*) in tropical forests of India using camera-trap surveys. We examined population-level temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal segregation among them across four reserves representing a gradient of carnivore and prey densities. Temporal and spatial overlaps were higher at lower prey densities. Combined spatio-temporal overlap was minimal, possibly due to chance. We found fine-scale avoidance behaviours at one high-density reserve. Our results suggest that: (i) patterns of spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal segregation in sympatric carnivores do not necessarily mirror each other; (ii) carnivores are likely to adopt temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal segregation as alternative mechanisms to facilitate sympatry; and (iii) carnivores show adaptability across a gradient of resource availability, a driver of inter-species competition. We discuss behavioural mechanisms that permit carnivores to co-occupy rather than dominate functional niches, and adaptations to varying intensities of competition that are likely to shape structure and dynamics of carnivore guilds. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

A new species of dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus shethi sp. nov., of the C. medius group is described from the dry and
transitional forests of northern Madagascar. This species can be found along the forest corridor from Ankarana Special Reserve
east to the Analamerana Special Reserve down to the Bekaraoka forest in the Loky-Manambato Protected Area. This species is
genetically distinct from other members of the C. medius species group and is sister to a poorly known lineage in Sambava. The
identification of this new species highlights the importance of northern Madagascar as a reservoir of biodiversity.

47 Tucanae (also known as NGC 104 and Caldwell 106) is a globular cluster located in the constellation Tucana.

47 Tucanae is the second brightest globular cluster in the sky (after Omega Centauri), and is noted for having a very bright and dense core. It is one of the most massive globular clusters in the Galaxy, containing millions of stars. The cluster appears roughly the size of the full moon in the sky under ideal conditions. Though it appears adjacent to the Small Magellanic Cloud, the latter is some 210,000 light-years distant, over 10 times farther away. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

There is a growing focus on child wellbeing and happiness in schools, but we lack self-report measures for very young children. Three samples (N = 2345) were combined to assess the psychometric properties of the How I Feel About My School (HIFAMS) questionnaire, which was designed for children aged 48 years. Testretest reliability was moderate (intraclass correlation coefficient = .62). HIFAMS assessed a single concept and had moderate internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha values from .62 to .67). There were low correlations between scores on the child-reported HIFAMS and parent and teacher reports. Children at risk of exclusion had significantly lower HIFAMS scores than the community sample (mean difference = 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) = [1.6, 3.2]; p  .001). Schools contributed only 4.5% of the variability in HIFAMS score, the remaining 95.5% reflecting pupil differences within schools. Girls scores were 0.37 units (95% CI = [0.16, 0.57]; p  .001) higher than boys, while year group and deprivation did not predict HIFAMS score. HIFAMS is a promising measure that demonstrates moderate reliability and discriminates between groups even among very young children. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Opening section for the busy:

A long-standing mystery among marine biologists is why otherwise healthy whales, dolphins, and porpoises  collectively known as cetaceans  end up getting stranded along coastal areas worldwide. Could severe solar storms, which affect Earths magnetic fields, be confusing their internal compasses and causing them to lose their way?

Although some have postulated this and other theories, no one has ever initiated a thorough study to determine whether a relationship exists  until now. NASA heliophysicist Antti Pulkkinen, who works at the agencys Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, has teamed with the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, or IFAW, to determine whether a link exists.

Strandings occur around the world, involving as few as three to as many as several hundred animals per event. Although a global phenomenon, such strandings tend to happen more often in New Zealand, Australia, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, said project collaborator Katie Moore, the director of IFAWs global Animal Rescue Program. Headquartered in Yarmouth Port, Massachusetts, IFAW operates in 40 countries, rescuing animals and promoting conservation to secure a safe habitat for wildlife.

These locations share some key characteristics, such as the geography, gently sloping beaches, and fine-grained sediment, which we think all play some role in these events, she said. </TEXT>

Some moons wouldn't survive the collision. Tethys, one of Saturn's larger moons at about 1000 kilometers in diameter, survived the collision, but today exhibits the resulting expansive impact crater Odysseus. Sometimes called the Great Basin, Odysseus occurs on the leading hemisphere of Tethys and shows its great age by the relative amount of smaller craters that occur inside its towering walls. The density of Tethys is similar to water-ice. The featured image was captured in November by the robotic Cassini spacecraft in orbit around Saturn as it swooped past the giant ice ball. Cassini has now started on its Grand Finale Tour which will take it inside Saturn's rings and culminate in September with a dive into Saturn's thick atmosphere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this is really interesting because it means their genome was undisturbed or changed by any incoming genetic flow until the easterly migrations of the Bronze Age. Everything they learned about farming came through communication with outside groups and not from genetic lineage or through marrying outsiders. That would suggest trade and relative "peace" with other societies at the time. Very cool article!

The journal article *The Neolithic Transition in the Baltic Was Not Driven by Admixture with Early European Farmers* can be found [here](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822\(16\)31542-1?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982216315421%3Fshowall%3Dtrue). 

**Highlights:**

* A degree of genetic continuity from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic in the Baltic
* Steppe-related genetic influences found in the Baltic during the Neolithic
* No Anatolian farmer-related genetic admixture in Neolithic Baltic samples
* Steppe ancestry in Latvia at the time of the emergence of Balto-Slavic languages


**Summary:**


The Neolithic transition was a dynamic time in European prehistory of cultural, social, and technological change. Although this period has been well explored in central Europe using ancient nuclear DNA [ 1, 2 ], its genetic impact on northern and eastern parts of this continent has not been as extensively studied. To broaden our understanding of the Neolithic transition across Europe, we analyzed eight ancient genomes: six samples (four to 1- to 4-fold coverage) from a 3,500 year temporal transect (8,3004,800 calibrated years before present) through the Baltic region dating from the Mesolithic to the Late Neolithic and two samples spanning the Mesolithic-Neolithic boundary from the Dnieper Rapids region of Ukraine. We find evidence that some hunter-gatherer ancestry persisted across the Neolithic transition in both regions. However, we also find signals consistent with influxes of non-local people, most likely from northern Eurasia and the Pontic Steppe. During the Late Neolithic, this Steppe-related impact coincides with the proposed emergence of Indo-European languages in the Baltic region [ 3, 4 ]. These influences are distinct from the early farmer admixture that transformed the genetic landscape of central Europe, suggesting that changes associated with the Neolithic package in the Baltic were not driven by the same Anatolian-sourced genetic exchange.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Conjunction of Four by Maxime Oudoux](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170204.html)

NASA's description:

On January 31, a waxing crescent Moon, brilliant Venus, and fainter Mars gathered in the fading twilight, hanging above the western horizon just after sunset on planet Earth. In this combined evening skyscape, the lovely celestial triangle is seen through clouds and haze. Still glinting in sunlight, from low Earth orbit the International Space Station briefly joined the trio that evening in skies near Le Lude, France. The photographer's line-of-sight to the space station was remarkably close to Mars as the initial exposure began. As a result, the station's bright streak seems to leap from the Red Planet, moving toward darker skies at the top of the frame.

<TEXT> Please don't downvote him or her. They are correct that usually there is an issue. With an animal this young though it's likely exhaustion and separation from their pod.

I came across a dead Humpback whale and that was a big issue for another story.

**Abstract:**

Social relationships can have important consequences for fitness in animals. Whilst numerous studies have shown that individuals often join larger groups in response to perceived predation risk (i.e. fear of predation), the importance of predation risk in driving the formation and stability of social relationships within groups has been relatively ignored. We experimentally tested how predation threat influenced fine-scale social network structure using Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). When perceived predation risk was high, individuals developed stable and more differentiated social ties compared to when perceived risk was low. Intriguingly, social differentiation coincided with shoals being somewhat smaller under high-perceived risk, suggesting a possible conflict between forming stable social relationships and larger social groups. Individuals most at risk of predation (large and bold individuals) showed the most exaggerated responses in several social measures. Taken together, we provide the first experimental evidence that proximate risk of predation can increase the intensity of social relationships and fine-scale social structure in animal populations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For anyone interested here are the Highlights and Abstract from the journal article found in the journal [*Circadian Entrainment to the Natural Light-Dark Cycle across Seasons and the Weekend*](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822\(16\)31522-6?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982216315226%3Fshowall%3Dtrue).

**Highlights**

* Living in the modern electrical lighting environment delays the human circadian clock
* The human circadian clock adapts to seasonal changes in the natural light-dark cycle
* A weekend camping trip prevented the typical weekend circadian and sleep delay

**Summary**

Reduced exposure to daytime sunlight and increased exposure to electrical lighting at night leads to late circadian and sleep timing [ 13 ]. We have previously shown that exposure to a natural summer 14 hr 40 min:9 hr 20 min light-dark cycle entrains the human circadian clock to solar time, such that the internal biological night begins near sunset and ends near sunrise [ 1 ]. Here we show that the beginning of the biological night and sleep occur earlier after a weeks exposure to a natural winter 9 hr 20 min:14 hr 40 min light-dark cycle as compared to the modern electrical lighting environment. Further, we find that the human circadian clock is sensitive to seasonal changes in the natural light-dark cycle, showing an expansion of the biological night in winter compared to summer, akin to that seen in non-humans [ 48 ]. We also show that circadian and sleep timing occur earlier after spending a weekend camping in a summer 14 hr 39 min:9 hr 21 min natural light-dark cycle compared to a typical weekend in the modern environment. Weekend exposure to natural light was sufficient to achieve 69% of the shift in circadian timing we previously reported after a weeks exposure to natural light [ 1 ]. These findings provide evidence that the human circadian clock adapts to seasonal changes in the natural light-dark cycle and is timed later in the modern environment in both winter and summer. Further, we demonstrate that earlier circadian timing can be rapidly achieved through natural light exposure during a weekend spent camping. </TEXT>

General Statement on posts - Please read at least the abstract before drawing any conclusions from the news source. News often misses important or interesting points and to really understand what the researchers were getting at it's important to understand the journal article. This is of course meant in no offense to the article's writer, but it is a common issue with only reading the news source.

And as always, please direct all comments at the specific content of the original post, or the specific scientific article it is based upon and do not post anecdotal comments.

<TEXT> Scientific terminology, yes, they are all Cetaceans. Porpoises and dolphins and whales are differentiated in common terminology due to size, tooth shape and a few other characteristics. I made a comment about differentiation before, I'll copy and paste here:

Size isn't the determining factor between what is a whale and a dolphin (though all are [Cetaceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacea) and technically whales). 

Dolphins have sizes that range from 5 ft to 30 ft whereas whales range from 10 ft to 115 ft. You can see the overlap in size between the two differentiations. 

Dolphins belong to different families than whales; [Delphinidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_dolphin) (oceanic dolphins), [Iniidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iniidae) (river dolphins), [Platanistidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian_river_dolphin) (South Asian river dolphin), [Pontoporiidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Plata_dolphin) (La Plata dolphin), and [Phocoenidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porpoise) (poirposes). Whales are separated into two sub-orders; [Mysticeti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen_whale) (baleen whales) and [Odontoceti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothed_whale) (toothed whales, which includes all of the dolphin families). Beluga whales belong to family **Monodontidae** in sub-order **Odontoceti**.

Some whales have baleen, all dolphins are toothed whales. Dolphins and whales are also shaped a bit differently (their heads for one) and dolphins have [flat, spade-shaped teeth](https://aqua.org/~/media/Images/Animals/Atlantic%20bottlenose%20dolphin/animals-dolphin-slide2-web.jpg) as opposed to [cone-shaped teeth](http://cdn1.arkive.org/media/52/52BB8F48-E222-4CDF-8E72-95DCC4440D91/Presentation.Large/Pygmy-sperm-whale-mouth-and-teeth-detail.jpg) (the photo is a Pygmy Sperm Whale) of other whales. Adding to the differences list, all baleen whales have [two blowholes](http://i.imgur.com/ZcsCcmm.jpg), whereas toothed whales (so not just dolphins) only [have one](https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Bottlenose_Dolphin_KSC04pd0178_head_only.JPG).

This little cutie is not a whale, but a ~~porpoise~~ dolphin (whoops mistype). It's a [Heaviside's dolphin](http://www.arkive.org/heavisides-dolphin/cephalorhynchus-heavisidii/) (*Cephalorhynchus heavisidii*). Easy to ID with that dark body and little white stripe. Kind of looks like a baby Orca!

These beautiful animals have a really short range, occurring only off the west coast of South Africa and Namibia. They live in family groups, or pods, of 2 to 10.

<TEXT> [NASA's page on the photo and summary:](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2017/hubble-captures-brilliant-star-death-in-rotten-egg-nebula)

The Calabash Nebula, pictured here  which has the technical name OH 231.8+04.2  is a spectacular example of the death of a low-mass star like the sun. This image taken by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows the star going through a rapid transformation from a red giant to a planetary nebula, during which it blows its outer layers of gas and dust out into the surrounding space. The recently ejected material is spat out in opposite directions with immense speed  the gas shown in yellow is moving close to one million kilometers per hour (621,371 miles per hour).

Astronomers rarely capture a star in this phase of its evolution because it occurs within the blink of an eye  in astronomical terms. Over the next thousand years the nebula is expected to evolve into a fully-fledged planetary nebula.

The nebula is also known as the Rotten Egg Nebula because it contains a lot of sulphur, an element that, when combined with other elements, smells like a rotten egg  but luckily, it resides over 5,000 light-years away in the constellation of Puppis. </TEXT>

Given their very limited range and how long it takes them to be sexually mature, they are listed as *endangered* on the [IUCN Red List](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7664/0). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Quick summary:

Its not quite Jurassic Park: No one has revived long-extinct dinosaurs. But two new studies suggest that it is possible to isolate protein fragments from dinosaurs much further back in time than ever thought possible. One study, led by Mary Schweitzer, a paleontologist from North Carolina State University in Raleigh who has chased dinosaur proteins for decades, confirms her highly controversial claim to have recovered 80-million-year-old dinosaur collagen. The other paper suggests that protein may even have survived in a 195-million-year-old dino fossil.

<TEXT> Ecologist sauntering in. Because this very cool pupil contraction is a form of courting ritual!

The [flame bowerbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_bowerbird) (*Sericulus aureus*) is, as you can see, absolutely breathtaking! I love the vibrant colors. Bowerbird males build shelters called *bowers* to attract females. Depending on the species the structures will differ some, but most form an archway and are decorated with brightly colored doodads. 

You can see a few examples here: [Photo 1](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--7p8NNLQFf0/UhbhP0rP6RI/AAAAAAAAClA/AgYenZqxP3k/s1600/bower+bird+3.jpg), [Photo 2](http://www.viralforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Satin-Bower-Bird-Nest.jpg), [Photo3](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/23/32154075_b242c23aa8_b.jpg). The more elaborate, the more the ladies are impressed! Once they lure a female they begin their courtship dance. 

These differ by species, but for the flame bowerbird a big part of the dance involves a wheezing call and the pupil fluctuations you can see in the gif.

The BBC Earth video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XkPeN3AWIE) and just one on the flame bowerbird [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT4kpr2efEs).

<TEXT> The article [*The life review experience: Qualitative and quantitative characteristics*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27840285) can be found in the journal *Consciousness and Cognition*.

**Abstract:**

**BACKGROUND:**
The life-review experience (LRE) is a most intriguing mental phenomenon that fascinated humans from time immemorial. In LRE one sees vividly a succession of one's own life-events. While reports of LRE are abundant in the medical, psychological and popular literature, not much is known about LRE's cognitive and psychological basis. Moreover, while LRE is known as part of the phenomenology of near-death experience, its manifestation in the general population and in other circumstances is still to be investigated.

**METHODS:**
In a first step we studied the phenomenology of LRE by means of in-depth qualitative interview of 7 people who underwent full LRE. In a second step we extracted the main characters of LRE, to develop a questionnaire and an LRE-score that best reflects LRE phenomenology. This questionnaire was then run on 264 participants of diverse ages and backgrounds, and the resulted score was further subjected to statistical analyses.

**RESULTS:**
Qualitative analysis showed the LRE to manifest several subtypes of characteristics in terms of order, continuity, the covered period, extension to the future, valence, emotions, and perspective taking. Quantitative results in the normal population showed normal distribution of the LRE-score over participants.

**CONCLUSION:**
Re-experiencing one's own life-events, so-called LRE, is a phenomenon with well-defined characteristics, and its subcomponents may be also evident in healthy people. This suggests that a representation of life-events as a continuum exists in the cognitive system, and maybe further expressed in extreme conditions of psychological and physiological stress. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to amend the title and say by "stable" I mean not a flat line on a graph. Hovering is still relatively stable.

Some populations that overshoot carrying capacity (K) can crash, which is an abrupt decline from high to low population density as resources are exhausted.

In my part of the U.S. (and many other parts of the U.S.), we see this with [White-tailed deer](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/w/white-tailed-deer/) (*Odocoileus virginianus*) populations in the winter. Without natural predators ([Grey wolves](http://www.nwf.org/wildlife/wildlife-library/mammals/gray-wolf.aspx), *Canis lupus*) to stabilize their numbers, the deer populations rocket up in the Spring and Summer and then due to starvation crash come winter.

Unfortunately, this not only affects deer but the habitats they live in. When one organism goes unchecked it can wreak havoc on the organisms they feed on, share resources with and even the soil and other [abiotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiotic_component) (non-living) resources around them. [Here is an example graph](http://www.msudeerlab.com/img/dynamics/dynamics6.jpg) of what an unchecked deer population does to the [ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never get tired of hearing about new species and how their lineages have affected organisms alive today. Their name means *Mighty traveler from Egg Mountain*. 

According to the article, if you just want a summary:

In the many-branched tree of lizard evolution, Magnuviator comes out as an iguanomorph. This is the broad  group that includes the anoles, basilisks, and iguanas that skitter around the American tropics today. But back in Cretaceous time, DeMar and coauthors write, the closest relatives of Magnuviator lived in Asia. The fossil stem from which today's iguanas and anoles sprung used to be spread in a different pattern over the planet, setting part of the foundation for what we see around us today.

Journal article *A new Late Cretaceous iguanomorph from North America and the origin of New World Pleurodonta (Squamata, Iguania)*.

Abstract:

Iguanomorpha (stem + crown Iguania) is a diverse squamate clade with members that predominate many modern American lizard ecosystems. However, the temporal and palaeobiogeographic origins of its constituent crown clades (e.g. Pleurodonta (basilisks, iguanas, and their relatives)) are poorly constrained, mainly due to a meagre Mesozoic-age fossil record. Here, we report on two nearly complete skeletons from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian) of North America that represent a new and relatively large-bodied and possibly herbivorous iguanomorph that inhabited a semi-arid environment. The new taxon exhibits a mosaic of anatomical features traditionally used in diagnosing Iguania and non-iguanian squamates (i.e. Scleroglossa; e.g. parietal foramen at the frontoparietal suture, astragalocalcaneal notch in the tibia, respectively). Our cladistic analysis of Squamata revealed a phylogenetic link between Campanian-age North American and East Asian stem iguanomorphs (i.e. the new taxon + Temujiniidae). These results and our evaluation of the squamate fossil record suggest that crown pleurodontans were restricted to the low-latitude Neotropics prior to their early Palaeogene first appearances in the mid-latitudes of North America. </TEXT>

*Bigger Is Fitter? Quantitative Genetic Decomposition of Selection Reveals an Adaptive Evolutionary Decline of Body Mass in a Wild Rodent Population*.

DOI: dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002592

**Abstract:**

In natural populations, quantitative trait dynamics often do not appear to follow evolutionary predictions. Despite abundant examples of natural selection acting on heritable traits, conclusive evidence for contemporary adaptive evolution remains rare for wild vertebrate populations, and phenotypic stasis seems to be the norm. This so-called stasis paradox highlights our inability to predict evolutionary change, which is especially concerning within the context of rapid anthropogenic environmental change.

*Bigger Is Fitter? Quantitative Genetic Decomposition of Selection Reveals an Adaptive Evolutionary Decline of Body Mass in a Wild Rodent Population*.

DOI: dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002592

**Abstract:**

In natural populations, quantitative trait dynamics often do not appear to follow evolutionary predictions. Despite abundant examples of natural selection acting on heritable traits, conclusive evidence for contemporary adaptive evolution remains rare for wild vertebrate populations, and phenotypic stasis seems to be the norm. This so-called stasis paradox highlights our inability to predict evolutionary change, which is especially concerning within the context of rapid anthropogenic environmental change. While the causes underlying the stasis paradox are hotly debated, comprehensive attempts aiming at a resolution are lacking. Here, we apply a quantitative genetic framework to individual-based long-term data for a wild rodent population and show that despite a positive association between body mass and fitness, there has been a genetic change towards lower body mass. The latter represents an adaptive response to viability selection favouring juveniles growing up to become relatively small adults, i.e., with a low potential adult mass, which presumably complete their development earlier. This selection is particularly strong towards the end of the snow-free season, and it has intensified in recent years, coinciding which a change in snowfall patterns. Importantly, neither the negative evolutionary change, nor the selective pressures that drive it, are apparent on the phenotypic level, where they are masked by phenotypic plasticity and a non causal (i.e., non genetic) positive association between body mass and fitness, respectively. Estimating selection at the genetic level enabled us to uncover adaptive evolution in action and to identify the corresponding phenotypic selective pressure. We thereby demonstrate that natural populations can show a rapid and adaptive evolutionary response to a novel selective pressure, and that explicitly (quantitative) genetic models are able to provide us with an understanding of the causes and consequences of selection that is superior to purely phenotypic estimates of selection and evolutionary change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The site in France is called Abri Blanchard and has a sister site Abri Castanet. Both are considered among the oldest sites in Eurasia bearing artifacts of human symbolism. The slab bears a complex image of an aurochs (wild cows) surrounded by rows of dots. 

I love prehistoric findings like this, they are a window into our past and help us better understand how culture and spirituality arise in humans.

DOI: 10.1016/j.quaint.2016.09.063

**Abstract:**

In the excitement of the widely publicized new finds of Aurignacian art from Chauvet, from the Swabian Jura and from as far afield as Pestera Coliboaia in Romania, it has almost been forgotten that a rich corpus of Aurignacian wall painting, engraving and bas-relief sculpture had been recognized and studied before World War I in the Vzre Valley of SW France. Scientific knowledge of the chronological and cultural context of that early-discovered graphic record has been limited by the crude archaeological methods of that pioneering era, and the loss and dispersal of many of the works discovered. In 2011, we launched new excavations and a re-analysis of one of the key sites for such early discoveries, the collapsed rock shelter of Abri Blanchard. In 2012, we discovered in situ a limestone slab engraved with a complex composition combining an aurochs and dozens of aligned punctuations.

This new find, recovered by modern methods and dated by molecular filtration and Hydroxyproline 14C, provides new information on the context and dating of Aurignacian graphic imagery in SW France and its relationship to that of other regions. The support is not a fragment of collapsed shelter ceiling and is situated in the midst of quotidian occupational debris. The image shows significant technical and thematic similarities to Chauvet that are reinforced by our reanalysis of engraved slabs from the older excavations at Blanchard. The aligned punctuations find their counterparts at Chauvet, in the south German sites and on several other objects from Blanchard and surrounding Aurignacian sites. In sum, we argue that dispersing Aurignacian groups show a broad commonality in graphic expression against which a certain number of more regionalized characteristics stand out, a pattern that fits well with social geography models that focus on the material construction of identity at regional, group and individual levels. </TEXT>

The [North Pacific wolf eel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_eel) (*Anarrhichthys ocellatus*) is a species of wolffish (Family Anarhichadidae). They are found, well in the north Pacific ocean and can grow up to 8 ft long. 

While they look vicious and have a face only a mother could love, wolf eels are excellent parents! Females [lay up to 10,000 eggs](https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animal-guide/fishes/wolf-eel) at a time and then coil around the clutch to protect them. They also mate for life.

As adults, they prefer crunchy food, such as crustaceans, sea urchins, mussels, snails and sand dollars.

Well this isn't so much a space topic as a light/photon topic. Where I teach, and I believe most universities in the US, students of all majors are required to take a basic introduction to biology course. How light works, especially in relation to ecosystems/photosynthesis/trophic levels/color perception etc. is mentioned at least briefly. I go over it in my lecture when we get to each relevant chapter.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a great question I'm surprised no one has asked me before!

In the case of Orchid bees I knew about their proboscis, colors and their gathering volatile oils to attract the ladies. I was not aware of the Florida population or the parasitism, so thank you National Forest Service!

I have a general working knowledge of a lot of insects, arachnids, and birds because I've done research with them and I love them. I also have a degree in Marine Biology and grew up doing a lot of fishing and have marine scientist friends, so I'm alright with a good amount of marine life (at least to initially identify). I'm full of random facts. I read *all the time* and love nature documentaries. I also teach Climate Science, Environmental Science, and Biology and learn a lot to keep class interesting.

From this cloud I know where to look for deeper information to get a larger story for each organism I comment on. I'm also great at identifying organisms because I love taxonomy and the relationship between familial groups.

I try not to reference journal articles because that's a little much for the general public, but I usually know of a few websites that can back up the fact or two I remember, and then add on to it.

I do not have a great working knowledge of plants or fungi, they are much harder for me to comment on. I've got some field guides though and I'm reading papers in my spare time to broaden my general knowledge. I can't wait for Spring to get out in the forests and get hands on! My husband bought me a new camera for Christmas I've been getting used to, my Instagram feed @subject9866 is full of birds, so I'm excited for more time. I find a general knowledge of a lot of things gives me more to work from when doing specific research.

So TL;DR I remember a little bit about a lot of things then find my sources to create a broader picture. If I have done research on that organism I remember almost everything I've worked on, but still find resources because no one should have to take my word for it. 

If anyone says they know everything about a topic and especially all from memory, they are not being honest.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Journal Article link](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916307431)

**Highlights**

* Behavioral and psychiatric differences between men and women suggest that the human amygdala is sexually dimorphic.

* Systematic review of the literature identified 46 studies reporting amygdala volumes in 58 age-matched samples of males and females (6726 individuals).

* Meta-analysis of matched raw volumes demonstrates a moderate-sized sex difference and average bilateral amygdala volume about 0.3 cm3 (10%) larger in males, comparable to the 1112% larger overall volume of males brains.

* By contrast, meta-analysis of volumes normalized for overall brain size demonstrated no significant sex difference in amygdala volume.

* The frequent claim that the amygdala is proportionally larger in males was not supported.

**Abstract:**

The amygdala plays a key role in many affective behaviors and psychiatric disorders that differ between men and women. To test whether human amygdala volume (AV) differs reliably between the sexes, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of AVs reported in MRI studies of age-matched healthy male and female groups. Using four search strategies, we identified 46 total studies (58 matched samples) from which we extracted effect sizes for the sex difference in AV. All data were converted to Hedges g values and pooled effect sizes were calculated using a random-effects model. Each dataset was further meta-regressed against study year and average participant age. We found that uncorrected amygdala volume is about 10% larger in males, with pooled sex difference effect sizes of g=0.581 for right amygdala (=28, n=2022), 0.666 for left amygdala (=28, n=2006), and 0.876 for bilateral amygdala (=16, n=1585) volumes (all p values  0.001). However, this difference is comparable to the sex differences in intracranial volume (ICV; g=1.186, p.001, 11.9% larger in males, =11) and total brain volume (TBV; g=1.278, p0.001, 11.5% larger in males, =15) reported in subsets of the same studies, suggesting the sex difference in AV is a product of larger brain size in males. Among studies reporting AVs normalized for ICV or TBV, sex difference effect sizes were small and not statistically significant: g=0.171 for the right amygdala (p=0.206, =13, n=1560); 0.233 for the left amygdala (p=0.092, =12, n=1512); and 0.257 for bilateral volume (p=0.131, =5, n=1629). These values correspond to less than 0.1% larger corrected right AV and 2.5% larger corrected left AV in males compared to females. In summary, AV is not selectively enhanced in human males, as often claimed. Although we cannot rule out subtle male-female group differences, it is not accurate to refer to the human amygdala as sexually dimorphic. </TEXT>

What an absolutely stunning kingfisher, *Ceyx erithaca*! There are so many beautiful  birds in Thailand that they also call this one the [Black-backed kingfisher](https://www.thainationalparks.com/species/oriental-dwarf-kingfisher). As far as birds go here though, in my neck of the US, it's stunning! The [Rufous-backed kingfisher](https://www.thainationalparks.com/species/rufous-backed-kingfisher) (*Ceyx rufidorsa*) is sometimes considered a subspecies. [Check out how beautiful these guys are!](http://www.ourbreathingplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3-4.png)

They are found in found in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

Kingfishers are forest birds usually found near lakes. Some specialize in eating fish, as it says in their name, but depending on the region they will also eat small mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and insects. 

They are cavity nesters and prefer [burrows in the ground](http://www.akellyphoto.com/html/wildlife/bird_gallery/kingfisher/Kingisher-Burrow-sm.jpg). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Extends from the surface up to the numbers given. I can clarify in my original comment if it looks confusing.

Wikipedia -

The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about 12km, although this altitude actually varies from about 9km (30,000ft) at the poles to 17km (56,000ft) at theequator,

My numbers come from the text book I am teaching out of, I trust that more that Wikipedia and it's what my students will be going off of so those are my notes numbers. It does get lower near the poles, but on average that's the height.      </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well-preserved otter material of giant size, including crania, mandibles and postcranials, was recently unearthed from the latest Miocene lignite beds of Shuitangba in Yunnan Province.

Alive during the Miocene these giant otters were around for our giant crocodilians and other reptiles, and a myriad of other large and small mammals. 

[Full and free journal article](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14772019.2016.1267666)

**Abstract:**

Otters (subfamily Lutrinae) are semi-aquatic predators in the family Mustelidae. Modern otters have a worldwide distribution but their fossil record is poor, often consisting of fragmentary jaws and teeth. Multiple lineages have developed bunodont dentitions with enlargements of molars, usually for cracking molluscs or other hard foods. Some lineages have evolved badger-like teeth and, as a result, were often confused with melines (Old World badger clade). Siamogale thailandica Ginsburg, Invagat,   Tassy, 1983 from the middle Miocene basin of Mae Moh in northern Thailand is one such species, whose fragmentary dental remains have thus far impeded our understanding. A new species of fossil otter, Siamogale melilutra sp. nov., represented by a nearly complete cranium, mandible and partial skeletons of at least three individuals, was recovered from the latest Miocene (6.2 Ma) lignite beds of the Shuitangba Site in north-eastern Yunnan Province, south-western China. Computed tomography (CT) restoration of the crushed skull reveals a combination of otter-like and badger-like cranial and dental characteristics. The new species belongs to the Lutrinae because of its possession of a large infraorbital canal and ventral expansion of the mastoid process, among other traits. A distally expanded M1, however, gives a badger-like appearance. In overall morphology the Shuitangba otter is closest to Siamogale thailandica. A previously described jaw (Lutra aonychoides) from the early Pliocene of the Yushe Basin in north China is also here referred to S. melilutra. No previous attempt has been made to provide a global phylogenetic framework for otters. We present the first combined morphological and molecular (nuclear and mitochondrial DNAs) character matrices of five extant (Pteronura, Lontra, Enhydra, Aonyx, Lutra) and eight extinct genera (Tyrrhenolutra, Paralutra, Paludolutra, Enhydritherium, Siamogale, Vishnuonyx, Sivaonyx, Enhydriodon) to better understand the evolution of bunodont otters. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses consistently recover an eastern Asian clade that includes forms from Shuitangba, Yushe and Mae Moh, all of which are referred to Siamogale. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whoops, that order is lowest to highest!

I'm teaching an intro course on Climate Science this semester, so prepare for some Climate-related facts as we move on peppered in with the rest. I'll throw some of my notes in the comments to expand on concepts.

**Troposphere**

* Earth's surface to 16 to 18 km (52,000 to 59,000 ft)
* *Tropo* means to turn or change
* Layer closest to the Earth
* 80% of the total mass of the atmosphere
* Green-houses gasses are concentrated
* Tropopause separates it from the Stratosphere
  * Without the stability of the Stratosphere there would be no Troposphere

**Stratosphere**

* 50 km (30 mi)
* *Strato* means layers
* Gases here are layered and do not mix
* Contains most of the ozone within the atmosphere
  * Ozone absorbs UV light
 * Life did not spread from water to land until about 400 million years ago, with the development of the ozone layer
* Temperature increases with altitude as ozone absorbs UV light
* Air is thin here and does not contain moisture
* Supersonic jets fly here!

**Mesosphere**

* 85 km (50 mi)
* *Meso* means middle
* Increasing in altitude temperature decreases
* Coldest layer of the atmosphere, -93oC (-135oF)
 * Fewer molecules to absorb UV rays
* Weather balloons fly here!
* Meteors burn up here

**Thermosphere**

* 500 km (300 miles)
* *Thermo* means heat
* Increasing in altitude, temperature increases
* 1,000oC (1832oF) or higher
* Charged partials cause auroras
* Meteors and satellites fly here!

](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170120.html)
On January 18 a tantalizing sunset was captured in this snapshot. Seemingly sliced into many horizontal layers the Sun shimmered moments before it touched the horizon, setting over the Pacific Ocean as seen from the mountaintop Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. Pink hues of filtered sunlight were created by the long sight-line through the hazy atmosphere. But the remarkable layers correspond to low atmospheric layers of sharply different temperature and density also along the line of sight. Over a long path through each layer the rays of sunlight are refracted strongly and create different images or mirages of sections of the setting Sun. </TEXT>

This taxon was formerly known as *T. spectrum*, but, Brandon-Jones et al. (2004) argued that *T. spectrum* is a junior synonym of *T. tarsier*, and this has since been confirmed by Groves (2005). </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Source Arkive page](http://www.arkive.org/spectral-tarsier/tarsius-tarsier/)

The [spectral tarsier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_tarsier) (*Tarsius spectrum* or *Tarsius tarsier*) is a species of tarsier found in Indonesia. Tarsiers have the largest eyes, relative to body weight, of any mammal! These large eyes help them gather as much light as possible at night, as they are mostly nocturnal animals. You can tell by the gif that they are insectivores, but they will also eat small lizards.

Tarsiers in general, are the smallest of primates. Their genus name *Tarsius* comes from their elongated tarsal or ankle region.  

Spectral tarsier young are fairly [precocious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial) (young are up and moving at a very young age, not like humans) and able to climb at just a day old and hunt alone by 26 days. [Here is a photo of a mother with her young.](http://s3.amazonaws.com/mongabay/indonesia/600/sulawesi-tangkoko_0991.jpg) They are pretty adorable!

[IUCN Red List](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/21491/0) lists the spectral tarsier as vulnerable and is protected by law in Indonesia. According to [Ecology Asia.com](http://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/mammals/spectral_tarsier.htm):

The Spectral Tarsier only occurs on the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi and some smaller nearby islands including Peleng and Selayar. Two other species of Tarsier occur in other parts of Southeast Asia - these are the Western Tarsier, which occurs in Borneo and Sumatra and the Philippine Tarsier in southern parts of the Philippines. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brief summary:

The scientists have now studied three different parts of the divergent ridge (area where the ocean plates are slowly sliding away from each other) that crosses Iceland from southwest to northeast. The slow movement and separation of the ocean plates can cause cracks in Earth's crust, through which hot magma from the planet's interior rises to the surface. As a result, a large number of volcanos have emerged along the divergent boundary.

'The study includes data with extremely high precision. Data from 1967 to the present, together with the very best modelling software, have yielded the best picture to date of the anatomy of the divergent boundary,' says Md. Tariqul Islam, lead author of the article, which has been published in Journal of Geophysical Research. </TEXT>

Like an illustration in a galactic Just So Story, the Elephant's Trunk Nebula winds through the emission nebula and young star cluster complex IC 1396, in the high and far off constellation of Cepheus. Also known as vdB 142, the cosmic elephant's trunk is over 20 light-years long. This colorful close-up view includes image data from a narrow band filter that transmits the light from ionized hydrogen atoms in the region. The resulting composite highlights the bright swept-back ridges that outline pockets of cool interstellar dust and gas. Such embedded, dark, tendril-shaped clouds contain the raw material for star formation and hide protostars within. Nearly 3,000 light-years distant, the relatively faint IC 1396 complex covers a large region on the sky, spanning over 5 degrees. This dramatic scene spans a 1 degree wide field, about the size of 2 Full Moons. </TEXT>

At least eight species can squirt an aimed stream of blood from the corners of the eyes for a distance of up to 5 fet (1.5 m).They restrict blood flow leaving thier heads which increases blood pressure and ruptures blood vessels around the eyelids. This is not only confusing to predators, but the blood tastes pretty nasty to canine and feline predators. It apparently has no effect against predatory birds.

More on that from this BBC article [*If it has to, a horned lizard can shoot blood from its eyes*](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151105-if-it-has-to-a-horned-lizard-can-shoot-blood-from-its-eyes).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist flying in.

The term [*cuckold*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckold) comes from the [Cuckoo family of birds, *Cuculidae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo). Cuckoos (and a few other species such as the [Brown-headed cowbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-headed_cowbird)) lay their eggs in other birds' nests. We call this [*brood parasitism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite). The host bird either doesn't realize the new egg is not theirs, or in some cases the cuckoo comes back and destroys the host eggs if they try to remove the cuckoo eggs.

The cuckoo eggs usually hatch first and the chicks start pushing the host eggs out of the nest ([Here is a video of a Common cuckoo ejecting a Reed warbler egg from the nest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO1WccH2_YM)). If a host egg manages to hatch the cuckoo will kick the chick out. The host bird will continue to feed the interloper until they are adults and fledge.

For more information here are a few articles:

General Statement on posts - Please read at least the abstract before drawing any conclusions from the news source. News often misses important or interesting points and to really understand what the researchers were getting at it's important to understand the journal article. This is of course meant in no offense to the article's writer, but it is a common issue with only reading the news source.



And as always, please direct all comments at the specific content of the original post, or the specific scientific article it is based upon and do not post anecdotal comments.

**Abstract:**

Numerous behavioral paradigms have been developed to assess tinnitus-like behavior in animals. Nevertheless, they are often limited by prolonged training requirements, as well as an inability to simultaneously assess onset and lasting tinnitus behavior, tinnitus pitch or duration, or tinnitus presence without grouping data from multiple animals or testing sessions. To enhance behavioral testing of tinnitus, we developed a conditioned licking suppression paradigm to determine the pitch(s) of both onset and lasting tinnitus-like behavior within individual animals. Rats learned to lick water during broadband or narrowband noises, and to suppress licking to avoid footshocks during silence. After noise exposure, rats significantly increased licking during silent trials, suggesting onset tinnitus-like behavior. Lasting tinnitus-behavior, however, was exhibited in about half of noise-exposed rats through 7 weeks post-exposure tested. Licking activity during narrowband sound trials remained unchanged following noise exposure, while ABR hearing thresholds fully recovered and were comparable between tinnitus(+) and tinnitus(-) rats. To assess another tinnitus inducer, rats were injected with sodium salicylate. They demonstrated high pitch tinnitus-like behavior, but later recovered by 5 days post-injection. Further control studies showed that 1): sham noise-exposed rats tested with footshock did not exhibit tinnitus-like behavior, and 2): noise-exposed or sham rats tested without footshocks showed no fundamental changes in behavior compared to those tested with shocks. Together, these results demonstrate that this paradigm can efficiently test the development of noise- and salicylate-induced tinnitus behavior. The ability to assess tinnitus individually, over time, and without averaging data enables us to realistically address tinnitus in a clinically relevant way. Thus, we believe that this optimized behavioral paradigm will facilitate investigations into the mechanisms of tinnitus and development of effective treatments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a general message I post every time I link a journal article after approving a post. Sometimes it applies better to certain articles than others, but it is important to at least give the abstract a run as a lay person. Some writers do sensationalize.

I understand the audience of the sub, I've been posting here for years (other name). Again, it's a general statement to give the journal article a chance or at least the summary and see if both the news and the science lines up. I don't think you're giving the audience here enough credit on what they can glean for themselves by giving it a try.

It's also a reminder to stay on topic as comments tend to stray in most posts. Again, it's a general message, as this post is not getting too much attention right now. It's for everyone, I wasn't singling out your post or this particular news article. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The [spectral tarsier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_tarsier) (*Tarsius spectrum* or *Tarsius tarsier*) is a species of tarsier found in Indonesia. Tarsiers have the largest eyes, relative to body weight, of any mammal! These large eyes help them gather as much light as possible at night, as they are mostly nocturnal animals. You can tell by the gif that they are insectivores, but they will also eat small lizards.

Tarsiers in general, are the smallest of primates. Their genus name *Tarsius* comes from their elongated tarsal or ankle region.  All of their digits have flattened nails, except the second and third toes, which are equipped with a [toilet claw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grooming_claw) (also called a grooming claw, but toilet is pretty fun), used in grooming ([Source Arkive page](http://www.arkive.org/spectral-tarsier/tarsius-tarsier/)).

Spectral tarsier young are fairly [precocious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial) (young are up and moving at a very young age, not like humans) and able to climb at just a day old and hunt alone by 26 days. [Here is a photo of a mother with her young.](http://s3.amazonaws.com/mongabay/indonesia/600/sulawesi-tangkoko_0991.jpg) They are pretty adorable!

[IUCN Red List](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/21491/0) lists the spectral tarsier as vulnerable and is protected by law in Indonesia. According to [Ecology Asia.com](http://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/mammals/spectral_tarsier.htm):

The Spectral Tarsier only occurs on the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi and some smaller nearby islands including Peleng and Selayar. Two other species of Tarsier occur in other parts of Southeast Asia - these are the Western Tarsier, which occurs in Borneo and Sumatra and the Philippine Tarsier in southern parts of the Philippines. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium bovis and still remains one of the world's biggest global health burdens. Recently, engineered polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biobeads produced in both E. coli and Lactococcus lactis displaying mycobacterial antigens were found to induce significant cell mediated immune responses in mice. We observed that such PHA beads contained host cell proteins as impurities which we hypothesized to have the potential to induce immunity. In this study we aimed to develop PHA beads produced in mycobacteria (mycobacterial PHA biobeads, MBB) and test their potential as TB vaccine in a mouse model. As a model organism, nonpathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis was engineered to produce MBB or MBB with immobilized mycobacterial antigens Ag85A and ESAT-6 on their surface (A:E-MBB). Three key enzymes involved in the poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) pathway, namely -ketothiolase (PhaA), acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB), and PHA synthase (PhaC), were engineered into E. coli-mycobacteria shuttle plasmids and expressed in trans. Immobilization of specific antigens to the surface of the MBB was achieved by creating a fusion with the PHA synthase which remains covalently attached to the polyester core, resulting in PHA biobeads displaying covalently immobilized antigens. MBB, A:E-MBB and a mycobacterial vector control (MVC) were used in a mouse immunology trial, with comparison to PBS vaccinated and BCG vaccinated groups. We successfully produced MBB and A:E-MBB and used them as vaccines to induce a cellular immune response to mycobacterial antigens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really they tend to burp more than fart methane.

[Journal article link](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b04395)

**Abstract:**

Onion extract is used as a feed supplement for the diet of dairy cows, acting as inhibitor of methane production; however, its properties could alter sensory attributes of milk. In this work, we propose a method to evaluate the influence of this extract on milk properties, using propyl propane thiosulfonate (PTSO) as a marker. PTSO is extracted using a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe procedure and monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. The method was applied to milk samples obtained from 100 dairy cows fed during 2 months with enriched feed. In addition, a milk tasting panel was established to evaluate the PTSO residue that should not be exceeded to guarantee milk sensory attributes. It was established that a value of PTSO lower than 2 mg kg1 does not alter milk organoleptic properties. This fact makes onion extract an interesting alternative as a feed supplement to control the methane emissions without any influence on milk attributes.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Full and free journal article [*How Ants Use Vision When Homing Backward*](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\(16\)31466-X).

**Highlights:**

* Backward-walking ants rely on celestial but not terrestrial cue memories
* Correction of direction based on terrestrial cues occurs after peeking forward
* The retrieved direction can be transferred into a compass frame of reference
* Ants can decouple their travel direction from their body orientation

**Summary:**

Ants can navigate over long distances between their nest and food sites using visual cues.

Our results suggest that ants do not adjust their direction of travel based on the perceived scene while going backward. Instead, they maintain a straight direction using their celestial compass. This direction can be dictated by their path integrator but can also be set using terrestrial visual cues after a forward peek. If the food item is too heavy to enable body rotations, ants moving backward drop their food on occasion, rotate and walk a few steps forward, return to the food, and drag it backward in a now-corrected direction defined by terrestrial cues. Furthermore, we show that ants can maintain their direction of travel independently of their body orientation. It thus appears that egocentric retinal alignment is required for visual scene recognition, but ants can translate this acquired directional information into a holonomic frame of reference, which enables them to decouple their travel direction from their body orientation and hence navigate backward.

<TEXT> Brief summary:

The *Arkansaurus fridayi* was discovered in 1972 by a man named Joe Friday who was reportedly searching for the missing bovine when he spotted a fossilized foot on his land in Lockesburg. Crews had churned up tracts of earth to build a road, and Friday noticed a few long toe bones poking through the soil, said ReBecca Hunt-Foster, a paleontologist with the Bureau of Land Management.

The fossils, named after Friday, were sent to the University of Arkansas, where they were studied, reconstructed and displayed in a museum for years.

Now, Hunt-Foster wants *Arkansaurus fridayi* to be recognized as a distinct type of dinosaur, fit with its own scientific name. She recently submitted a paper making her case to a journal for review.  </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Nonhuman primates, our closest biological relatives, play important roles in the livelihoods, cultures, and religions of many societies and offer unique insights into human evolution, biology, behavior, and the threat of emerging diseases. They are an essential component of tropical biodiversity, contributing to forest regeneration and ecosystem health. Current information shows the existence of 504 species in 79 genera distributed in the Neotropics, mainland Africa, Madagascar, and Asia. Alarmingly, ~60% of primate species are now threatened with extinction and ~75% have declining populations. This situation is the result of escalating anthropogenic pressures on primates and their habitatsmainly global and local market demands, leading to extensive habitat loss through the expansion of industrial agriculture, large-scale cattle ranching, logging, oil and gas drilling, mining, dam building, and the construction of new road networks in primate range regions. Other important drivers are increased bushmeat hunting and the illegal trade of primates as pets and primate body parts, along with emerging threats, such as climate change and anthroponotic diseases. Often, these pressures act in synergy, exacerbating primate population declines. Given that primate range regions overlap extensively with a large, and rapidly growing, human population characterized by high levels of poverty, global attention is needed immediately to reverse the looming risk of primate extinctions and to attend to local human needs in sustainable ways. Raising global scientific and public awareness of the plight of the worlds primates and the costs of their loss to ecosystem health and human society is imperative. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

Drosophila platonic (plt) males court females, but fail to copulate. Here we show that plt is an allele of scribbler (sbb), a BMP signalling component. sbb knockdown in larvae leads to the loss of approximately eight serotonergic neurons, which express the sex-determinant protein Doublesex (Dsx). Genetic deprivation of serotonin (5-HT) from dsx-expressing neurons results in copulation defects. Thus, sbb+ is developmentally required for the survival of a specific subset of dsx-expressing neurons, which support the normal execution of copulation in adults by providing 5-HT. Our study highlights the conserved involvement of serotonergic neurons in the control of copulatory mechanisms and the key role of BMP signalling in the formation of a sex-specific circuitry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brief summary for the busy:

In the Namib desert, the land is patterned with mysterious circles, arranged in a regular pattern. Across the expanse, rings of high grass cordon off empty spots of sandy orange ground. The origins of those circles have never been determined.

For years, scientists have debated the cause of these fairy circles, and recently a sharp divide has separated partisans of two competing theories. One gives credit for creating the circles to sand termites; the other to the plants.

Now, a new paper published in Nature suggests that both theories could be true and that the behavior of both sand termites and plants could contribute to creating the haunting pattern that has obsessed so many scientists.

**Abstract:**

An intact forest landscape (IFL) is a seamless mosaic of forest and naturally treeless ecosystems with no remotely detected signs of human activity and a minimum area of 500 km2. IFLs are critical for stabilizing terrestrial carbon storage, harboring biodiversity, regulating hydrological regimes, and providing other ecosystem functions. Although the remaining IFLs comprise only 20% of tropical forest area, they account for 40% of the total aboveground tropical forest carbon. We show that global IFL extent has been reduced by 7.2% since the year 2000. An increasing rate of global IFL area reduction was found, largely driven by the tripling of IFL tropical forest loss in 20112013 compared to that in 20012003. Industrial logging, agricultural expansion, fire, and mining/resource extraction were the primary causes of IFL area reduction. Protected areas (International Union for Conservation of Nature categories I to III) were found to have a positive effect in slowing the reduction of IFL area from timber harvesting but were less effective in limiting agricultural expansion. The certification of logging concessions under responsible management had a negligible impact on slowing IFL fragmentation in the Congo Basin. Fragmentation of IFLs by logging and establishment of roads and other infrastructure initiates a cascade of changes that lead to landscape transformation and loss of conservation values. Given that only 12% of the global IFL area is protected, our results illustrate the need for planning and investment in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation efforts that target the most valuable remaining forests, as identified using the IFL approach. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist swimming in! Me too. What a beautiful gif.

The flickering or flashing we're seeing is a warning. It says "Predator, I know you're here! Don't try anything."

Cephalopods can change the color *and* texture of their skin! It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells that reflect light and hold pigment and are found just below the skin. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and some insects also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a small sack full of pigment (black, brown, orange, red or yellow) which can stretch. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear more dull. Aside from chromatophores some cephalopods also have [iridophores](http://en.termwiki.com/EN/iridiophore) and [leucophores](http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2646). Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates which create iridescent colors (greens, blues, silvers and golds) which you can see in [this photo](http://www.the-scientist.com/images/February2013/Fig1A_Loligo-Overview---pic-from-Grayson-Hanlon.jpg) of *[Loligo paeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longfin_inshore_squid)*. Leucophores mirror back the colors of the environment, helping the animal blend in with its surroundings.

Aside from mesmerizing prey and camouflage cephalopod colors are also used to attract mates and warn potential predators or rivals that the organism should not be messed with. For example male Caribbean reef squid (*[Sepioteuthis sepioidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_reef_squid)*) turn red to attract females and white to repel other males. Interestingly they can actually [split the coloration of their bodies down the middle to attract a female on one side and repel a male on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YViRSgYys1o). Another example, Humboldt (*[Dosidicus gigas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_squid)*) [squid will flash red and white to warn predators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NDwGAeHnyQ).

There was a [study in 2015](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/2/161.2) where scientists strapped cameras onto Humboldt squid to try to decode the communication. I didn't see anything super conclusive in the article, but I would assume they are working on it. It's a really great topic.

Some cephalopods can change the texture of their skin by manipulating [muscular hydrostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat). Hydrostats can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. [Our tongues have muscular hydrostats which allow us to stretch it out.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopus-arms-human-tongues-intertwine-for-science/) According to a [paper published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.20221/abstract):

The octopuses [in the study] had three dedicated types of muscles that control their on-call skin protrusions, or papillae. One set are shaped in concentric circles to lift the skin vertically away from the body. Another set pulls this form together, to determine the shapewhether it will be a round bump or tall spike. And a third group seems to pull the raised section back toward the surface, spreading out its base.

More on that in [this Scientific American article](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/how-the-octopus-creates-instant-3-d-camouflage-on-its-skin/).  

Edit - Folks are asking how they know what colors to change. We actually are not sure. There was a great [Mental Floss interview](http://www.mentalfloss.com/article.php?id=61532) with an aquarist:

Good question, and one that researchers are still trying to answer. They know Cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and cuttlefish) match their skin to their surroundings using their eyesight. But whats perplexing is that octopuses are actually colorblind. Its possible they can distinguish between different polarization of light better than humans can, but the exact method for how they identify color is unknown. 

Also, not Unidan! I'm a woman (Uni is a guy) and I've been around and answering comments and questions (on another account /u/Alantha) at the same time and with Unidan. He's a great guy. We'd bounce comments off of each other before he was chased out. There are many many scientists who are happy to talk about their profession and saying we are all Unidan is insulting. We all went to school, worked relevant jobs, maybe published research or taught or whatever. We worked hard and continue to work hard and deserve to be our own people. Calling every scientist who pops in Unidan is lazy and old hat. Leave the dead horses alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Summary for the busy:

Karen Kapheim and Makenna Johnson tested a variation of the reproductive ground plan hypothesis, a long-examined theory in studies of evolution of social bees, in solitary, ground-nesting bees of south central Washington state. 

"This variation of the reproductive ground plan hypothesis suggests division of labor - the ways social bees cooperate to complete all tasks necessary to keep the colony running - evolved from ancestral gene networks that function to align a female's dietary preferences with the nutrients she needs during different phases of her reproductive cycle," says Kapheim, assistant professor in USU's Department of Biology and the USU Ecology Center.

<TEXT> Ecologist digging in!

What a very cool gif! I think most people have a weird idea as to what a barnacle is, but let me break it down for you! 

[Barnacles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle) are arthropods (which means jointed foot) and are crustaceans. Like crabs, lobsters, shrimp, etc. These little guys are suspension feeders when adults, but actively swim when larvae.

Inside that nifty shell the animal is laying on its back and sticking its feathery limbs out from the carapace to pull in food. They have 6 pairs of limbs, two antennae, one eye (which likely only sense light/dark changes) and not much else going on outwardly.

[Here is a pretty amazing model of what the animal looks like within the carapace.](http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/model-of-barnacle-with-cutaway-showing-internal-organs-closeup-picture-id90116602?s=170667a) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Link to the [full and free journal article](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13854).

Please read at least the abstract before drawing any conclusions from the news source. News often misses important or interesting points and to really understand what the researchers were getting at it's important to understand the journal article. This is of course meant in no offense to the article's writer, but it is a common issue with only reading the news source.



And as always, please direct all comments at the specific content of the original post, or the specific scientific article it is based upon and do not post anecdotal comments.

**Abstract:**

Negative racial stereotypes tend to associate Black people with threat. This often leads to the misidentification of harmless objects as weapons held by a Black individual. Yet, little is known about how bodily states impact the expression of racial stereotyping. By tapping into the phasic activation of arterial baroreceptors, known to be associated with changes in the neural processing of fearful stimuli, we show activation of race-threat stereotypes synchronized with the cardiovascular cycle. Across two established tasks, stimuli depicting Black or White individuals were presented to coincide with either the cardiac systole or diastole. Results show increased race-driven misidentification of weapons during systole, when baroreceptor afferent firing is maximal, relative to diastole. Importantly, a third study examining the positive Black-athletic stereotypical association fails to demonstrate similar modulations by cardiac cycle. We identify a bodybrain interaction wherein interoceptive cues can modulate threat appraisal and racially biased behaviour in context-dependent ways. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello and thank you for taking the time to speak with us here today.

Do you have the opportunity to still be creative in the private sector? As scientists we often have questions of our own not directly related to what we are working on currently. Do you have the freedom to pursue anything a little differently or do you have to stick to what the company needs? Often new discoveries are made from unplanned experimentation.

Thank you again for your time, it's appreciated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't mind at all! I grew up with a father who had a great love of nature and the outdoors. He taught me nothing is gross; no spiders, no insects, no slugs, fish or toads or frogs. All things are amazing! I grew up in the New Jersey Pine Barrens and only 20 minutes from the ocean. 

I brought home many animals; snakes, frogs, toads, fish, insects, box tortoises, etc. My father set up a kiddie pool in our backyard and whatever I brought home we'd keep for a day or two and learn as much as we could about that animal. Then we'd return it, well fed, to where I originally found it.

In high school I took as many science courses as I could; marine bio, biology, earth science, environmental science, etc. I then went to college and received my B.S. in Marine and Environmental Biology and Policy. I worked for my state's Fish and Wildlife program studying endangered shore birds. I worked in a mosquito genetics lab for a couple of years afterward. Then I worked as an environmental scientist for a few years, left, worked with endangered grassland birds and moved on to graduate school. In grad school I studied arthropod sensory ecology and how predator cues affect prey behavior; I worked with wolf spiders, pill bugs, potato bugs (terrestrial isopods), German roaches and field crickets. I received an M.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Now I teach a few courses at my local university and am currently working on two research projects while considering getting my PhD. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist galloping in!

[Gelada baboons](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/gelada/) (*Theropithecus gelada*) are definitely one of the more  baboon species. I love their manes!

They are also called the "bleeding heart baboons" because of this amazing [skin patch](https://thedeepestlove.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/rod-waddington-from-kergunyah-australia-simien_mtns_6174572833.jpg) on their chests. They look incredibly majestic, in my opinion.

Endemic (found only in) to the high mountain meadows of Ethiopia they are found all over the steep mountains and sleep together on ledges. 

They eat grass and are the last surviving species of ancient grazing primates ([grass blades make up to 90% of their diet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelada#Range_and_ecology)). They live in small family groups run by a dominant male, though when he is too old the dominant female has the last word in kicking him out, to be replaced by a younger more fit male. He doesn't usually go without a fight!

Like most primates, they communicate with sound and facial expressions, spend a lot of time [grooming each other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelada#/media/File:D%C5%BEelady.jpg) and are prone to squabbles. The gif is from a [Nato Geo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDT0xSsrVIg) and is showing a dominant male protecting his harem from a bunch of interloping young males. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist flying in! I made a post with this gif in /r/batty and /r/batfacts yesterday. If you love bats, please check those subs out!

Happily, according to the [IUCN Red List](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/10985/0) these beautiful animals are of "least concern" though in South Asia this species is locally threatened by habitat loss, largely through commercial logging and the conversion of land to agricultural use. It is also threatened by conversion of plantation lands to make way for human settlements and changes in cropping pattern.

They are insectivorous and nest in small groups of 2 - 6 and their roosts can be found in the suspended nests of weaver finches and sunbirds or under the eaves of huts.

<TEXT> Ecologist flocking in.

Starling murmurations are so amazing! The flow of the starlings as they move together is really something to behold. It's spellbinding!

[Starling wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling)

Cornell's All About Bird site has a wonderful article about Starling Murmurations [here](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/how-do-starling-flocks-create-those-mesmerizing-murmurations/). Dr. Grainger Hunt describes the usual why in the article:

Almost always, Hunt writes, these aerial spectacles are caused by a falcon near the edge of the flock. It turns out that the beauty of a murmurations movements often arises purely out of defense, as the starlings strive to put distance between themselves and the predator..

For even more reading Wired has an easy to understand article on murmuration [here](https://www.wired.com/2011/11/starling-flock/) as well. </TEXT>

That very angry little guy or gal is a [frilled-neck lizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydosaurus) (*Chlamydosaurus kingii*), also known as "Frillies", and native to...wait for it....Australia (and New Guinea)! Like most of the sassy animals I see here and in other subs. A frill-necked lizard was featured on the reverse of the Australian 2-cent coin until 1991. Some folks keep them as pets.

These lizards are actually fairly large at 85 cm (2.79 ft) in total length. They flair their frills out like this when they are trying to scare off a predator to make themselves look larger and it looks like it's not working so well for this man or lizard. ;)

[National Geographic fun fact](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/frilled-lizard/):

Besides defense, this lizard's colorful frill may be used to help regulate body temperature.

[The babies are actually pretty cute!](http://rivista-cdn.reptilesmagazine.com/135105802.jpg?ver=1400005992)

It is also threatened by conversion of plantation lands to make way for human settlements and changes in cropping pattern. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist flocking in.

Starling murmurations are so amazing! The flow of the starlings as they move together is really something to behold. It's spellbinding!

[Starling wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling)

Cornell's All About Bird site has a wonderful article about Starling Murmurations [here](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/how-do-starling-flocks-create-those-mesmerizing-murmurations/). Dr. Grainger Hunt describes the usual why in the article:

Almost always, Hunt writes, these aerial spectacles are caused by a falcon near the edge of the flock. It turns out that the beauty of a murmurations movements often arises purely out of defense, as the starlings strive to put distance between themselves and the predator..

For even more reading Wired has an easy to understand article on murmuration [here](https://www.wired.com/2011/11/starling-flock/) as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ecologist swimming in! As much as I love the ocean, I'd also be a little freaked out surfing at night.

This beautiful bioluminescence is caused by [phytoplankton](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/phyto.html). There are two main classes of phytoplankton; [dinoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate) and [diatoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom). Dinoflagellates are our bioluminescent phytoplankton! A common species is the [*Noctiluca scintillans*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctiluca_scintillans), commonly known as the sea tinkle (I know, it's adorable). [Here's what it looks like up close](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/64/94/e9/6494e9f7bab8586dccae2f15c44cc7e8.jpg).
The bioluminescence is produced throughout the cytoplasm by a [luciferin-luciferase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin#Dinoflagellate) reaction in organelles called [scintillons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate#Bioluminescence).  

As I am sure you know, some marine animals also bioluminesce! Common examples are:

*  the squid [*Abralia veranyi*](http://ocean.si.edu/sites/default/files/styles/blog_photo/public/photos/2.09_P08_G10_Abraliabigger.jpg?itok=KYQhDjVX)
* various species of [lantern fish](http://biolum.eemb.ucsb.edu/organism/pictures/myctophid1.jpg)
* [angler fish species](http://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/984/135/50544_1_1280x720_640x360_177552451962.jpg)
* [googly eyed glass squid](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lm0f9j7AQA1qin08mo1_500.jpg) (*Teuthowenia pellucida*)
* [vampire squid](https://media.giphy.com/media/s62zb1ouMjHxK/giphy.gif) (*Vampyroteuthis infernalis*)
* many many jellyfish or jellies (both words are still used, obviously they are not fish); [*Aequorea victoria*](http://www.dmlim.net/img/aeq/RaskoffAequorea.jpg), [*Aurelia aurita*](https://1nlbgh367fhx33e65vxs7rl8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Moon-JellyFish.jpg), [*Bolinopsis infundibulum*](http://68.media.tumblr.com/312506db6d05e9ce8962a26f9bac91fd/tumblr_nviwvrGW1K1ue1k7zo1_1280.jpg), etc.

<TEXT> Ecologist running in!

That very angry little guy or gal is a [frilled-neck lizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydosaurus) (*Chlamydosaurus kingii*), also known as "Frillies", and native to...wait for it....Australia (and New Guinea)! Like most of the sassy animals I see here and in other subs. A frill-necked lizard was featured on the reverse of the Australian 2-cent coin until 1991. Some folks keep them as pets.

These lizards are actually fairly large at 85 cm (2.79 ft) in total length. They flair their frills out like this when they are trying to scare off a predator to make themselves look larger and it looks like it's not working so well for this man or lizard. ;)

[National Geographic fun fact](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/frilled-lizard/):

Besides defense, this lizard's colorful frill may be used to help regulate body temperature.

[The babies are actually pretty cute!](http://rivista-cdn.reptilesmagazine.com/135105802.jpg?ver=1400005992)

Some folks even keep them as pets. Reptiles Magazine has a [Care Sheet](http://www.reptilesmagazine.com/Care-Sheets/Frilled-Lizard-Care-Sheet/) on them. </TEXT>

Evolution definitely rules. It's one of my favorite courses to teach! This little [kangaroo rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_rat) also rules. 

These little guys and gals are native to western North America. They are excellent jumpers, as we've seen, and can jump up to 9 feet (2.75m) in one jump! They also have excellent hearing and can [detect even the relatively silent flight of owls](https://www.desertmuseum.org/kids/oz/long-fact-sheets/krat.php).

This gif is from the first high speed video capture of a Mohave rattlesnake ([*Crotalus scutulatus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotalus_scutulatus)) lunging at a Merriam's kangaroo rat ([*Dipodomys merriami*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam's_kangaroo_rat)) in the New Mexico desert.

<TEXT> Crows are highly intelligent birds and with that intelligence comes a need for stimulation. They get bored, just like we get bored or any other animal with free time not devoted to foraging, mating or sleeping.

Crows are frequently seen doing silly things to keep themselves amused. For instance:

[Sledding down a roof on a piece of plastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRnI4dhZZxQ)

[Rolling down a snowy car's windshield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ta33bMB70)

[Annoying a dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0xwX5iOFok)

[Playing ball with a dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqLU-o7N7Kw)

<TEXT> The ants in the video are of the genus [*Leptogenys*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptogenys) as described by Dr. Terry McGlynn from California State University at Dominguez Hills. What's fascinating is, at the time of this video, this is [the first time ants have been seen to use a daisy-chain system](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/scientists-cannot-explain-this-crazy-ant-behavior-but-they-love-it/379390/) to transport large prey. Not that they have not chained together in other ways, but this is a first for daisy chains. 

According to the Atlantic article, I linked above:

Helen McCreery, a Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado, [recently published a paper on all kinds of cooperative transport strategies in ants](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00040-013-0333-3). In it she explains that at least 40 genera of ants work together to transport things, from two ants grasping something together to [weaver ant workers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AweT5kro6jY) who band together to collectively carry birds, bats, and snakes vertically up tree trunks.

<TEXT> A little back story necessary for the engagement story:

When we first started dating we went bowling with a group of friends. He bought me a silly zebra striped acrylic ring from a vending machine. I promptly lost it a week later. Thus began a 5 year joke of "How can I buy you a real ring if you can't even hold onto a 25 cent ring?"

It was the weekend before Christmas and my then boyfriend and I were exchanging early Christmas gifts to avoid dragging presents to another state.

He provides me with my final gift. It's a small red box, filled with acrylic rings in plastic bubbles. My eyes tear up and I say "I can't believe this is still a joke. You're ridiculous. He says I should put them all on, so I begin opening bubbles and putting on a dozen or so rings, laughing the entire time.

He then says I missed a bubble. I look down and he must have snuck in one more. Inside it is not an acrylic ring, but a diamond engagement ring.

I start crying. He squeezes me hand and asks the big question.

/r/ISaidYes

Bonus: He couldn't get the right amount of plastic bubbles to put the rings in (which came from Amazon) so he went to the local grocery store and with the help of a little kid who was there with his mother, proceeded to get a dozen or so toys out of the machine. He gave the toys to the kid and kept the plastic bubbles. </TEXT>
