<TEXT> Sounds like a nice idea to get a feel for the maps for new players. If you wanna get a feel for the maps just play as much as you can starting with Terro hunts like u/sdfsefsdf said and then get into casual. It took me a while to get used to all the maps aswell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Roamers and Trappers may not have the time time to reinforce during prep phase or maybe roamers just wanna get out of the Obj room. This leaves a breachable hatch or wall that can easy be breached giving the attackers and additional entry point possibly costing the game.

Give defenders the option the drop their Reinforced wall to allow other operators to pick them up and put them to use.

Comment if this is a good or bad idea.

Edit: Attackers cannot pick them up (Duh). </TEXT>
