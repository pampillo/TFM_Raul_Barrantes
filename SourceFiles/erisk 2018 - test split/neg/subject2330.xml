<TITLE> What happened to 'Half in the Bag'? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 16:33:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't always agree with these guys, but they always make me laugh. They haven't posted anything in the last 4 months or so. Didn't know if anyone had any information on if they're doing anything new. Are they planning to do a 'Rogue One' review?   
Also what's up with this 300 character limit? I'm literally only asking to meet the requirements of submitting this post. Seems silly to make me type out an extra lengthy explanation when my original question is quite short and to the point. I'm also not going to count every single character at this point and I hope that I have typed enough. But just in case I haven't I suppose I should write just a little bit more to meet this arbitrary quota. I don't like to eat pop corn at the movies as I used to work at one, and the smell drives me nuts. 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> About two years ago it took me a little over a year to track down every issue including The Morning Star option which was a limited series before the real comic began. Now there's 3 large paperback collections of all issues but I can't bring my self to buy it because I love my individual issues. I had no faith when Fox picked it up but god damn. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dude, please. I absolutely love the comic Lucifer and read that as well as Sandman once a year. You want to talk about an adaptation that's gone off the rails? Fox's version of Lucifer spits in the face of anyone who read the comic. American Gods(although not exactly what you want) ain't that fucking bad.  

As far as your concerns over buckets of blood and raging cocks, maybe you're just too sensitive for the material? Everything I've seen so far in both episodes has been necessary and quite stylish.  

Pretend the book was just a synopsis for this series and let it rest deep down in the back of your mind. You'll enjoy the show a little more. It's the only one you're getting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can understand him not wanting to go back because he couldn't. I just couldn't understand why he had to kill her but then I remembered he's a fucking god(little g) and a sociopath. If she's dead there's no reason to return. I guess I'm just so used to movies explaining themselves that I expected more explanation than he had already given. I actually appreciate this exchange even more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Someone please show me the scripture that says anything about Satan being an angel. There isn't any. Satan or Shaitan was just a creature that lived on the Earth. Nowhere does it say anything about him being a fallen angel. If you want to get into Sammael an actual angel but no connection, or Lucifer(never said to be an angel) then I'd be interested.   

The Antichrist was never said to be angel, that's all Renaissance poetry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The show was about a pissing and moaning rich guy who couldn't use his powers. The entire season should have been the first 3 episodes with growth from there. The story is about a guy who becomes a monk and trains for 15 years but he can barely fight. Most of the characters motivations don't make any sense. Danny was completely irresponsible and let people with little to no experience tag along on his missions. In the old comics Luke Cage and Iron Fist are great friends, I have no idea how they will ever convince me that Danny Rand isn't anything but a bleached(seriously who was dying his hair?) blond, self-centered twat.   
That being said I'm glad you enjoyed the show but as far as your 'untrained' eyes go, I come to these shows for some action. The choreography is terrible.   
Let me ask you this, did you enjoy Jessica Jones? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok so from everything I've read and watched tires almost do nothing in the game at all accept for a handful that benefit with off-road tires. So I've always just thrown off road tires on all my cars because I've grown to like how they look. My source is broughy1322 on youtube.

<TEXT> I wish I would have loved this film, or even liked it more than I actually did. The action was great  and the gore was what I've been asking for for 20+ years. I really hated X24 and everything about it. Before he appeared on screen I kept anticipating something big and and felt deflated when he arrived. The movie is beautiful and I suppose a decent send off but I can't support the praise. I hope everyone enjoyed their experience, and got something from it but it just totally fell flat for me. 6/10. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you really going to sit there every day up until release and think "this movie is ruined, this movie is ruined, this movie is ruined.."? If you want to see it, see it. If it's written well enough, accidentally finding out a plot point won't destroy the entire experience. This fucking crying over spoilers world we live in now is ridiculous. I wouldn't go out of my way to ever purposely ruin a movie for someone, but you are in a thread that's discussing a film that's been released. You're here at your own risk. The guy should have been more careful with plot points, but seriously grow up. ^^Rosebud ^^is ^^his ^^sled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't believe this was ever confirmed, but there are many who believe the creatures from 'Signs' are demons. It's not that water hurts them, but blessed or holy water. The little girl who leaves the water around the house has blessed it through touch. Later in the movie it says something about how people in Jerusalem or something found an ancient method of killing the creatures which is probably holy relics or blessed water.  

Also I've never believe for a second that Dad's weakness is water. If you'd remember in 'Unbreakable' the teacher tells David he frowned and died for 5 minutes. I think this actually activated his latent abilities. When he falls in the pool at the end he only believes he's screwed but we don't get to see if he'd actually drown. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-01-23 21:28:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am a 30 year old man living in Southern New England. I've worked in many jobs in my life but I'm not satisfied with the direction I'm heading in. I used to love remodeling my house with my father, and doing some play production in high school. After much consideration I decided that I wanted to become a carpenter.  

I tried to apply with the New England Carpenters union and made it through the interviews twice, only to be rejected. For the last year I've been applying to every helper position I could find but I'm not getting responses. I fear that employers see my age an believe that I'm going nowhere, and this is just another job. But that is not the case at all.  

I have no criminal record at all, and I can pass a drug test on a moments notice.. I'm just looking for some advice as to where I should be looking and applying, and to get started. I know I'm not going to make much money in the beginning but that's okay.  

Where did you get your start, and how can someone like me get into this career?  

Edit: I just wanted to let you guys know(if anyone cares) that I actually got a response from craigslist.  
I went and did a working interview in their shop and they decided to take me on! It's going to be a bit of a pay cut but I'm okay with it, because this is what I want to do.  
Thanks for everyone who responded.

One of the characters does a photoshoot for a magazine and their bf/gf gets mad and thinks they were hanging all over the other model.

<TEXT> For the same reason they love Nightmare before Christmas. It's quirky and dark and has a love story that's not perfect. Not saying fit girls can't fantasize, but anyone who is below average/overweight/unnatractive is going to fantasize more heavily about opportunities they wish they had. Harley is a powerhouse yet at the same time she's very vulnerable and has been a victim to the Joker.  

I know exactly where you're coming from with this, there's a lot of specific stories and characters that for some reason are very popular with overweight females and these are the only correlations I've found. People will disagree and get pissy but I've seen a pattern. </TEXT>

One of my builds that I really loved was a white mage who could not kill. I took Uthgerd as a follower her and married her. I know it's not exactly what youre asking for but I came very close to being Uthgerd's follower and all I was allowed to do was heal and buff her.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wish so bad from the first time I saw RotS that we never saw Vader's suit. I had always imagined Vader's look in ANH to be his refined almost ceremonial equipment. I wanted to see a very gritty Anakin, burned, and more machine than man. I think Lucas just rushed the Vader look to sell more toys. Why the hell would he look so polished? Palpatines just had these perfectly fitting pieces of gear lying around to reconstruct a man?  
I wanted to see the monster that Anakin was truly to become. Decked in mech, deformed/burned and a black cloak, hunting down the final Jedi. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure if this has come up in Hulk history, or if there's a what-if sub. Just talking to friends over a few drinks about the difference between Banner and Hulk. I don't believe Hulk's skin could be punctured to accept adamantium, and Banner wouldn't last long into the procedure before becoming Hulk.   
Anyone have any insight or ideas on these silly thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe the plan was one season of each(Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Iron fist) and then get them together for the Defenders. They wanted to establish their characters before just throwing them in a team. What happened was Daredevil did so well we all cried out for a second season! Now the Punisher was so good we want more from him too. You can't rush these things.   
I'm hoping once defenders starts there won't be anymore individual series unless it's for a new character. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would describe it as a GTA set in 1942 occupied Paris with really awesome climbing. Alot of people I told about the game they wrote it off as just a GTA clone but it was so much more than that. Also from what I understand it was the sawn song of the company Pandemic which is really a crime. GTA with the Assassins Creed climbing mechanics is what this world needs. </TEXT>

This is the set in question and I suppose you're right, it doesn't have the logo of the film on it. I'm guessing parents wouldn't have been happy with the word 'suicide' on the box. The set does contain Killer Croc, Katana, and Capt. Boomerang who are characters in the film but I guess that's just coincidence.  
Also it should be pointed out the Batmobile in the set does not match the footage we've seen, but I believe the Joker chase is a flashback. Not sure when SS is set but as we know bat's car was destroyed in BvS, so maybe new design for upcoming solo film? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  theory has been on here alot and popped up when we got the trailer for BvS and Suicide Squad. Also recently (Suicide Squad possible spoilers) [Red Hood is in the new Lego set for Suicide Squad.](#spoiler)That may not be confirmation but recently Giant man was in a Lego set before Captain Americanized Civil War was released.

It's interesting but as I said it was brought up a lot around here.

<TEXT> Just to slightly add to your theory, Ozymandias says his 35 minute line at 11:59pm(New York time and one minute to midnight ;) ) meaning he launched his attack at 11:24. John 11:24 says  "Martha answered, 'I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.'" Adrian's plan was sort of to ressurect peace from his massive destruction.  

We could do this all day and find hidden meanings in any numbers but I thought it was fitting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Book of Job is probably my favorite book of the Bible. Nothing fantastic really happens, a guy just loses his entire family, his health, and every thing he ever owned. He writes a few letters back and forth to friends about how he doesn't hate God, but loves him even more so. Christian's love this story and use it as an example of how faith works.  

The best part of the book is the whole subplot of God and Satan's conversation. Satan essentially tells God that Job only loves him, because God has given **everything** to Job. It's never clear if God himself takes part in the atrocities in Job's life or just lets Satan commit the acts. In the end all that really matters is God pretty smugly says to Satan, "Job has lost everything and he still loves me", while sticking his tongue out. Satan says, "*well I guess I was wrong*" while sort of shrugging his shoulders and fucking off into the sunset.  

What a great tale. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Would you buy a console version of Dissida? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-13 14:54:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Back around Christmas of 2009 I thought my Final Fantasy days were over. I was 10 when FF7 came out and I fell in love. Over the next 10+ years I played the entire catalogue over and over but could never get in FFXIII.  

My sweet grandmother who could never accept that I was getting older(22) bought me a PSP and Dissida for Christmas. I was so grateful because I was about to realize a dream I had had since I was 10, Final Fantasy 7 in my pocket.  

I ignored Dissida because I didn't really understand it for the first month. After 100% completion of FF7 I bought a guide for Dissida and really dug in. The story was OK, but what really shined through was the actual mechanics and fighting system. I was hooked and started convincing all of my FF fan friends to get the game. The summer of 2010 was just amazing being able to be a kid again sitting around with my group of friends, fighting our favorite characters.  

The point of this post basically is that I'm obviously in love with Dissida. I feel as if it's the best fighting game I have ever played. Mortal Kombat/Tekken/Street Fighter do not compare in my opinion. Ever since that summer I've been longing for that experience again. I believe a console based online fighting game like Dissida could make ridiculous money for Squenix.  

My question is, would you buy it? Is there any real interest in a console release? I think the possibilities are endless. I don't care if they remake the first game, just want a game where I have RPG elements in a fighter. They could potentially release the game with 20 characters and then later release over time through DLC every character from FF history.  

**TL;DR** Dissida is the GOAT fighting game. Would you drop $60 to beat your friends ass as Onion Knight and all your other iconic Square friends? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Major Star Wars TFA spoilers. Please do not enter unless you have seen the film. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-18 12:23:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Im still going to mark spoilers just incase you didnt read the fucking title.  


If you've seen the movie you know that [Han Solo](#spoiler) dies. Now [Harrison Ford](#spoiler) famously almost quit the franchise back in the early 80's. He's been so happy on all of his appearances leading up to this movie because he knows he's officially done. I'm sure some where deep down in his black heart he appreciates the franchise(I hope so atleast), but I'm sure he was even more happy to cash one more check. Hell, Alec Guiness also famously hated being Obi-Wan and begged Lucas to kill him off early, to keep his performance minimal. I propose that [this](http://i.imgur.com/PCsOA7M.jpg) is a shit eating grin.

<TEXT> I'm talking big budget and low budget films that may have had a great cast/director/writers, that just ended up terrible in the end. 

I think a great example for me would be The Dark Knight Rises. I'll just say that I did not expect Anne Hathaway to do a great job, but then she blew me away with the bar scene alone. But the rest of the cast/team had previously knocked it out of the park, and it just didn't pan out for me at least.


Another example would be Gangster Squad. Holy shit, the cast list had me hyped when I first saw the trailer, and then it fell flat. </TEXT>

I'm on NG+ with a particular character at 20mil SM and I can't get Alonne captain armor. Every other character I have as at least one of this chest pieces. I used 4 ascetics last night on a NG character in the DLC to get a certain chicken wing, and nothing. 


I have all of the appropriate gear for item find and occasionally pop the coins, but I truly believe that the game can peer into my brain disable drops that I want. This tinfoil hat is itchy, but I hope it helps!

<TEXT> This is probably common knowledge but I feel like a fool. I have several characters I PvP with, by my Butcher has been my favorite for a while now. Whenever someone whips out the old MonScim I always use the slightly unique R2 combo to kill them.

Well today someone parried that attack. They only hit me for very little damage and I still won the fight, but I literally gasped when it happened. I'm assuming because of the slow wind up it's just hard to time a parry on the move and I've been skating on this ice this whole time.

<TEXT> I've played through hundreds of hours of DS2, beat it on everything from NG-NG+7 with many different builds, and the DLC on NG-NG+6 as of today.


I've never tried a parrying/fencer build ever. What it comes down to is I suck at parrying. I started a new character today and picked up Ricards rapier. I already have the required Dex, and 105 agility. What I'm looking for is some tips on how to make this play through, and possibly some PvP, not torture. Any suggestions are welcome, from equipment and fashion, to stats and strategy. 


Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

This actually happened by accident when I found the peasant hat.

Edit: If anyone cares I'm making a very similar build right now. It's essentially Bruce Wayne becoming Batman. All you need is an imagination and the desire to punish yourself even more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently purchased Lego Marvel, and I love it. I know I've seen some play sets at wal mart and such but I'm wondering if anyone knows where I can buy just the figures. I'm 27 and don't really have the extra funds to be spending on Lego play sets at this time. But if I could have some of the figures for my desk and what not, it would make my day. </TEXT>
