<TITLE> How to Stop Your Walls from Bleeding </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 23:31:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I tossed and turned in bed, now half asleep.  I could feel my cotton sheets twisting and winding around my legs as I moved.  I could almost see the faint red glow of my alarm clock through my eyelids.  I could hear the soft, gentle ticking of my wristwatch.  Gasping for breath, I opened my eyes and bolted upright in bed.  Sweat plastered my hair to my head, my shirt to my body.  I blinked and tried to catch my breath.  I rubbed my eyes and glanced at my alarm clock.  A:G7, it said.  I knew that couldnt be right.  I also knew what that meant.  The walls were bleeding again.  Fuck.

I yawned and stretched and pressed the Indi-Glow button on my wristwatch.  3:33 AM exactly.  Of course.  I leaned over and switched on my bedside lamp.  Sure enough, thick, chunky blackish red blood was oozing from my walls.  Specifically, from the part where the wall and the ceiling met, as well as every nail hammered into the wall to hold up a photo.  The blood was splashing onto my bureau, leaving little puddles behind as well as streaks on my mirror.  It was staining my brand fucking new plush white carpet.  Double fuck.  I had literally just gotten that cleaned earlier in the week.  Seriously, how long did it take to clean it last time?  And Im pretty sure I cant make another insurance claim, what with the end of days deciding to happen outside of my apartment building.

Oh yeah, thats apparently a thing, too.  I keep seeing all these zombie-type creatures wandering around outside.  They look rotted and mangled and exactly like youd expect corpses that had been safely buried underground to look should they decide to claw their ways free and explore the neighbourhood.  Also they moan quite loudly.  I get it, you want brains, but Im trying to sleep here.  Guess no sleep for me tonight anyhow, now that my walls are bleeding and the splashing is really starting to get loud.

Occasionally I will even see the random ghost float on through, but when I glanced up I was fortunate enough to only get a glimpse of spiders traversing around in complex patterns on the ceiling.  This was a new one.  I really fucking hate spiders.  They leave all these webs and they take forever to clean up.

This is my life, now, I guess.  Im not really sure exactly what happened.  Something about the government wanting to try to recreate antimatter in a loop generator, tearing the fabric of space and time  I could really care less.  I just want to sit in my nice, quiet, clean house.  The rest of my family is out of town.  (Or somewhere, Im not even sure because Dooms Day has been going on for, near as I can tell, 3 days and the phones arent exactly working correctly.  Im not even sure how I have wi-fi but its probably because I make sure to meticulously dust and vacuum daily.)  So, fuck you spiders, zombies, and bleeding walls, Im going to enjoy this me-time!

Just as I swing my feet over the side of the bed, deciding enough is enough  a loud howl starts coming from what might actually be in my basement.  I could feel something inside of me snap.  I wanted to sleep so that I could wake up tomorrow and clean up this annoying blood.  I start stomping my bare feet as I head down to the basement, my pale green nightshirt barely covering the goods, but I just DONT CARE ANYMORE.

I threw open the basement door.  The howling intensified.  I took a deep breath and I screamed from deep down within me, WILL YOU PLEASE JUST SHUT UP AND CONTINUE THIS AT A DECENT HOUR?  DO YOU THINK THAT BLOOD IS GOING TO CLEAN ITSELF UP?  I SWEAR, IF I HAVE TO COME DOWN THERE I WILL MAKE YOU CLEAN UP THIS BLOOD YOURSELF!  I was panting and gasping again.  Because damn, that took a lot out of me.

Suddenly there was a strange, un-hellspawn-like hiss of surprise.  I heard all kinds of odd sucking noises, then silence.  Seething with rage I headed upstairs to find the spiders all gone and most of the blood has rolled back up into the ceiling and from wherever else its come from.  All of it except the blood that had streaked the mirror.  Something had smudged its finger in there to leave me a message.  Me sorry for disturbing you.  Leave you alone.  Please no yell again.  Eventually that, too, faded away.

I inspected my rugs and walls once more before climbing back into bed.  Even the zombies outside seemed quiet, but I didnt lift my blinds to check.  The alarm clock read a perfectly normal 4:00 AM.  I proceeded to snuggle back down into my pillows.  Dooms Day can come as it may, but not before I get my sleep.

Anyway, I thought Id post this here in the hopes that if anyone is left out there, you could use it to make your cleanup a breeze.  Enjoy what time you have left, after all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As much as I'd prefer titles like, "The Long Walk Home" to "I Walked Home in the Dark and Something Followed Me" I find myself clicking on the longer titles first.  Yes, I eventually get to the shorter titles that maybe don't grab my attention quickly, but unless it's a favourite author of mine, they are usually the last to come by. </TEXT>

Don't feel guilty about that break.  Nobody thinks you can't handle it - you're doing a great job, even if you don't think you are, lol.  Moving is a huge pain the ass w/o kids!!

Deep breaths, so you *can* handle it when you're back at it again :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> BabySpawn is 16 mo and still takes 2 naps.

So, around that age, he, too, was waking up earlier and earlier, but we made a point to keep him up until what his normal naps would be - 10:30/11 and again around 4:30/5 - with bedtime at 8:30.  

I asked the pediatrician about it, too, and she explained that she thought it was just BabySpawn waking up, realizing I wasn't there, missing me, and wanting me to give the cuddles.  The first couple of nights I went in to soothe (and make sure he didn't pee his diaper out) but then I started waiting a few minutes and he would fall back asleep.  Eventually, he stopped waking up and crying.

It took a couple of weeks, but it worked itself out and how it's back to normal.  (Whatever that is, lol.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome back :)

/r/wownoob will probably help you best for things like this!  However, Broken Shore quests are the "newest" dailies to be doing right now.  You can get some nice gear from that, but it is a bit of a grind.  Make sure you're also doing the other WQ, LFR, heroics, M+, etc.  www.icy-veins.com will provide a useful guide.

Good luck. </TEXT>

But, then you'd need more than one, so I guess that's not very practical.  I've had XBoxes, Nintendos, and Segas.  My personal opinion is that Nintendo systems are the most family friendly out there.  All the Mario Parties, Mario Kart, Super Smash, etc...

Heck I could even said go old school and get an SNES!!!  Literally such a thrill to play a lot of games there, even today.  I will occasionally break out the N64, GameCube or Wii, but somehow I feel drawn back to SNES. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ever since BabySpawn arrived on this Earth, we've done "nice, nice" while gently caressing his face, or using his hands to gently touch our faces.  Somehow within the last couple of weeks, BabySpawn has decided to rub the sides of my face saying, "Nieee, nieee" (which is him trying to say "nice") then immediately trying to gouge my eyeballs out _  (Come to think of it, maybe he's trying to say "die"...)

I've tried to pretend cry and say he's hurting mommy, telling him no, distractions, etc but he just LAUGHS at me.  (Tbh I'm lol'ing as I write this, but still.  I don't laugh at him while correcting him.)  So, how can I stop this, b/c my poor eyeballs T_T  Or am I raising SatanSpawn?! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the dog exchange, I sent a link to a very expensive dress w/ puppies on it.  I said something along the lines of, "I don't expect you to buy this for me, but this is an example of something I'd wear and what my style is."  I also requested no Pop figures b/c I don't have space for them.  My giftee was able to nail it based on that.

Anyway, I just think it's super rude to assume you're going to get something expensive from a random gift person.  Smh. </TEXT>

/r/woward is a very awesome group to join if you're Horde.  They do some lowbie stuff, but you need to be appropriately geared.

This forum has a Discord that I've seen some good groups forming, but I have yet to try anything with anyone there.

If you're Alliance/US, you can feel free to PM me your B-tag and we can run stuff sometime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't want to know the gender of my 1st kiddo - I wanted it to be a surprise.  I said outright that I hoped it was a boy but I didn't care so long as the baby was healthy.  If/when I have #2, I hope it's a girl so that I can have 1 of each, but again, that doesn't matter either.

With my son, he plays with his cousins' princess horses and their pink cooking set.  He plays with trucks and cars.  I brush his hair and take real joy in picking out super adorable outfits.  I want to sign him up for sports.  We dance together to music.  (I'd sign him up for dance class if he wanted; I just really hated it so I guess that's why I hesitate.)

The only real "complaint" I had was that b/c I chose to have his gender be a surprise, I had a hard time finding clothes.  My "theme" was puppies, stars, and moons.  Do you know how hard it was to find not-blue puppy items??  1/2 of the stuff baby had was blue b/c there were no options.  Annoying.  And, if/when I have #2 and it's a girl, she's wearing "boy" clothes as well as "girl" dresses.  B/c why not?  I wear "boy" clothes sometimes.  I'm looking at you, shorts that are always so short they show off my butt cheeks so I have to wear men's shorts.  xD </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes and no.  It's a very big adjustment time.  Once you find your rhythm again, things will smooth out.

You will be sleep deprived, but hopefully you have some kind of support system that will come over and watch the baby while you catch up on some sleep.  Night and day will cease to mean anything to you for a while :P  But, I made it a point to go out with baby as much as possible so he'd get used to being around people, noises, etc.  He'd just fall asleep whenever, whatever.  Now that kiddo can sleep through an explosion, lol.

I never once had to poop or shower while wrangling the kiddo.  I did those things when he was napping, or when my husband was on Baby Duty.

This might be slightly different if you are nursing.  I only nursed for a month.  Not having to stop and nurse or pump made things a lot easier.  I didn't have to plan things around these sessions.

SAFE bed-sharing is also a lifesaver.  Check up on that, if you're into it.   </TEXT>

I'm not entirely sure I believe it, but you're not entirely wrong either.  I've given a gift to a stranger expecting nothing else in return b/c I knew it would make him feel great.  Yes, seeing his reaction gave me pleasure, but that was not *why* I gave him the gift.  I didn't want him to feel left out - I wanted him to be included.

<TEXT> Open-minded person here.  I come from a family of Roman Catholics.  Not super-pushy or anything, but let's put it this way - I was the only 1 not to be married in a church.  If I had to "label" myself, I'd say Pagan.  Husband.JPG is agnostic; bordering now toward atheism.

We've decided to raise BabySpawn to live by the mantra "Be excellent to each other."  If he asks questions like, "Who is Jesus?" I will tell him he's a great example of a good person who tried to help people when he was able.  Stuff like this.  If he asks other questions, I want to be honest with him.  If he wants to go to church with my dad, that's fine.  Really I want him to follow what is right in his heart.  Even if he decides he wants to be an atheist.

I guess what I find shocking is that people don't understand that you can be an atheist and *still* be an awesome, great person, just like you can be religious and be a horrible person.

<TEXT> I am 34 and I have only have my license for 2 years.  I failed the practical (road) test 2x before I passed.  It wasn't that I did anything especially poorly, it was that I was afraid and nervous.  Visibly so.  Shaking.  I told the instructor I was nervous, hoping that he'd have mercy on my Soul.  Nope.

The 3rd attempt I literally faked it.  I was still nervous.  My tummy was so upset I thought I was going to shit myself.  (I actually photo-finished it to the local Wawa after my test, RIP the person in the stall next to me T_T)  But I just was polite to my instructor and said almost nothing, despite how I actually felt.  While we were waiting our turn to parallel park, he asked me why I never had my license before, and I said I never really needed it, but I wanted to have a baby so I needed to do this.  I was so far away from the curb when it was my turn to park, but still, I faked confidence.

When my instructor passed me, I literally almost kissed him full on the mouth.  I was so, so excited.  And now, 2 years later I'm no longer nervous.  It's no big deal, and I wish I could tell my younger self the same thing.

TLDR:  Just be confident (even if you aren't, pretend you are!) and take your time.  Good luck with your test!!!! </TEXT>

And our USELESS MANAGER is blaming me, even though I've explained the problem several times.  I've physically SHOWN him your negligence.  Nothing has changed.

And I can't get a new job b/c I'm too "overqualified" for anything.  I need to make at least the small amount I make now to be able to afford to live should I try to go anywhere else.  This has been my life for over a year.  I fantasize almost daily about sitting here and just not doing my work to see what would happen.  I fantasize about going over my immediate manager's head to the next level manager to tell her all of the bullsh*t that's been going on.  I fantasize about outright quitting.

I'm going to snap very soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ooh if you like to hike outside of Geocaching then you def should get one.  I've heard some horror stories on the Geocaching boards, lol.  Depending on how into Geo you get, there's local factions of message boards that you can get onto, and they have local meetups.  I went to a local BBQ once and it was SO MUCH FUN!!!  And I did a Halloween party that was hilarious.  Even my then-lazy lump husband did the stuff and actually enjoyed himself, so you never know ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm finishing up my last two weeks of community college. I'm graduating with honors.

Honestly, good for you for not quitting.  That's amazing that you were able to balance a kiddo and school, b/c I don't think I could have done that.  Heck, I could barely handle my life in general when BabySpawn was first born!!  And that's awesome your next step is a free ride!!  That is such a huge load off your mind (and pocket, lol.)

I totally get that whole "next kid" thing - uhhh it's not really that person's decision to make.  e_e  Every family has at least one of those asshats, I've found!

<TEXT> Has your doctor said that your kids are overweight or unhealthy?  B/c if not, then I'm not sure I'd make an overly huge deal about it.

I do agree that everyone needs to be moving around and at the very least taking a walk once a day, just to unwind and relax and get the blood flowing.

You said that your kids aren't into sports - have you had them try them out, or they haven't shown interest?  B/c I remember my parents signing me up for t-ball, soccer, and dance w/o my ever having asked.  They did stop signing me up for dance when I expressed more interest in soccer/softball.  Could try to doing something like that.

Also - a really great and fun way to get out but it doesn't seem like exercise - GEOCACHING!  It's a global treasure hunt.  Some are easy peasy in a parking lot, but there are lots in parks that you have to walk or hike to, so that can be fun.  There are tons that are child friendly, too!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, this question 

It's hard but not impossible.  I used to keep BabySpawn in a little bouncy seat so he could watch me play.  Usually he just fell asleep watching me.  Mostly the first couple of months, it's eat, poop, cry, sleep.

It gets better when they get older and start sleeping through the night.  Now, at 1 year, 4 months - BabySpawn goes to bed at 8:30 so there's plenty of time to raid.  And on the weekends, he plays with his toys in the computer room while I play.  Sometimes he sits on my lap and watches me.

In the beginning, I'd rather sleep than play WoW, but let me tell you coffee does wonders :)  Yes, you will be playing less at first, but you will be back in action before you know it.

EDIT:  A word. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm one of those lucky people who's parents paid for her college, and I have a savings account (sadly not with $30k in it, though lol) but I still have a few money worries.  I work a full time job (40+ hrs a week) but I still barely make anything.  I couldn't afford benefits through my work after this latest "revamp of the system" so I now have that through my husband.  I make enough to keep us where we need to be.  I have little left over, but I still always try to deposit $10.00 a paycheck to my savings.  It sucks, but I would rather have it in a real emergency rather than a week's worth of coffee.  Some paychecks, I have to choose this.

Have you ever thought about talking to a financial advisor/planner?  You don't need to be rich to do it.  He can help you save and set up a budget to get what you want later in life, as well as manage your debit. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Game Freezing - AddOn Help/Just the Server Lag? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-01 16:27:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This week, for some reason whenever I /reload or switch characters my game lags out and freezes so that I have to alt+f4 out of it.  Not entirely sure why.

When I disable all addons, it still takes a while to log out, but it doesn't freeze.  If I enable just 1 addon, it lags out and freezes.  It doesn't matter what addon that I enable.

Is this happening to anyone else, or is this just related to the strange server lag that I've seen several posts about?  Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is the correct keto forum to post it, but I'm going to give it a shot.

I downloaded the Total Keto Diet app b/c I was wanting to try out some different foods and recipes instead of the same 5 variants I'd been eating.

But, I had a really hard time *finding* the ingredients in my local Shoprite.  They weren't anything crazy, things like almond flour, sugar free chocolate chips, etc.  I managed to find the almond flour but it was $10.00 for a very small bag!!  And they didn't even carry 100% cacao chips.

Where do you guys shop?  Is there anyplace that has a good variety of keto-friendly products like almond flour, etc?  (Or hey, just someplace where I can buy keto-friendly, ready-made muffins xD)

EDIT:  I'm in NJ </TEXT>

<TEXT> My son had torticollis, probably from the way he was laying inside the womb.  You can ask the doctor, and it will be documented.  Our dr sent us to a PT, which was a group of 3 different ladies.  They gave us a few exercises to try.

* Place your baby in the crib facing the wall.  She will naturally want to turn away toward the action.  So, it will help her stretch to her left.

*  Place baby on the floor or on a mat.  Jingle bells and make interesting noises on her left to encourage her to turn her head that way.

* Place baby on the floor or on a mat.  Gently turn her head to the left and hold for 5 seconds.  Repeat 5x.  (If she's like my son, she will probably get mad and not enjoy it, but it honestly helps.)

Also, be aware that if she continually is laying down on that side, her head might get a flat spot.  Baby did, and so we ended up needing to get a helmet for most of a year to correct it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No.  My mom actually had to have a C-section with me b/c I was stuck to the left and the doctor couldn't get me out.  Also I was on time-ish.  My brother was pretty standard, just a bigger baby.  not sure if he was early/late.

Baby's birth was only a couple of days early and other than the cord being wrapped around his neck, it was pretty normal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My then-boyfriend at the time picked me up from my house 3 hours earlier than we'd planned, so I wasn't ready.  I was a little surprised but I threw some stuff in a bag and said I would just shower and get ready at his house.  His shower was vile and filthy.  I tried not to cry as I showered, trying to keep myself from touching any parts of the walls.  He didn't buy me a gift or a card.  He dragged me out to eat at *his* favourite restaurant, and then back to his place where he just got shit-faced drunk.  We had to wait until he sobered up enough to drive me home, b/c I didn't have my license at the time   it was too far to walk.  When he dropped me off, I told him that he ruined my birthday, that it was literally the worst birthday ever.  He shrugged at me and said, "Who cares, it's just another day anyway." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Growing up I always asked for an allowance but I was not given one.  My parents always said that "I got what I needed when I needed it." - which is to say they bought me some things when I asked, rather than give me $$.  Whenever we got money for birthday, a holiday, rewards for good grades, etc the money was taken to the bank.  For Christmas/birthday, though my mom would put away 1/2 and we could spend 1/2 at Toys R Us.

I didn't have any issues with learning what money is, or how to save or anything like that b/c my parents also took the time to explain it to me, how checks work, how to pay bills, how to save money, etc.

So my thought here when BabySpawn is old enough is that yes, I will give him an allowance if he does all of his chores.  His chores (  eventually schoolwork) are his "job" just like my going to the office is a job.  From there I will teach him to save a percentage, and have some pocket money, too. </TEXT>

I mostly use Reddit on a PC anyway.  I really enjoy seeing the different themes and such.  One of my subreddits even changes their theme monthly to fit whatever is going on at the time.

Actually, that is one thing I wish for this forum - seeing the CSS updated more with different themes.  Maybe feature a different character from Legion every month or so.  Colours generally don't matter.  Black or white is fine with me. </TEXT>

If you are leveling an alt that starts out wearing leather, but then later can wear mail, that could be where the "new" gear came from, as you won't be able to xmog it if you can't use it.  Some items also have character level restrictions.  If you're level 20, you can't use gear that says "Level 50" on it. </TEXT>

He didn't recognize me; only messaged me b/c he saw that I was a cute gamer girl and that we lived in the same town.  He asked a clueless me out 3x (1 I was going on vacation with my family, and the second time I had raid; I wasn't missing that shit) - before we finally got together.

If you had told me high school self that I'd be marrying him someday, idk if I'd have believed you!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last night when I was singing Twinkle Star to BabySpawn before putting him down to sleep, he leaned in and kissed me on the lips.  Twice.  With a little "lipsmack" sound.  Guys.  I literally lost my train of thought mid-song and just kind of lamely sung the first verse 3x over and over before putting him down - I was so shocked b/c though we give him tons of kissies, he has never once ever tried to kiss us back.  I teared up and told Husband.JPG that we should have another baby, b/c all the feels.  *Rainbows and glitter and love to everyone today, pls!* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just based on some of your replies that I've read in this thread.  I would not have been mad about his going to a bikini barista place, but I would have been furious if he lied about it.  That is the major issue here, not the barista place.

You should try to have an open conversation with him, and try to be calm (hah!) about it.  Ask him to come clean about everything - this is his 1 chance.  Let him talk it out, apologize, etc.  Then (if you feel he hasn't done any major violations) forgive him, while telling him that if he lies to you again, there's going to be very serious repercussions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone just wants to get shit done ASAP. No time for words, nor emotes, nor stopping to help.

I almost always say hello when I join a group, will say random BS if needed, and say thank you when done.  If I am able, I will stop to help kill a mob or help someone getting ganked.  (Though if I'm being honest, if Horde is killing you, I'm probably just going to keep moving; I'm not very good at PVP so I generally avoid it when possible.)

Most people probably don't chat much in dungeons and such b/c they are probably on Discord together.  If you want to have a more social time, join a decent guild.  It may be difficult to find one, but they are out there.  What server are you on?  US/EU?  There is a guild recruitment thread you can check out and possibly find a place that works for you.

I've played consistently since 2008 and a big part of that is the social interaction.  I've made friends here that I would never have met otherwise. </TEXT>

I was very sheltered when I was growing up   I lived on a busy road so there weren't any kids to play with like there would be in a neighourhood.  I was a very good kid, high grades, behaved well, etc, but I was almost never allowed to go out and do things with other kids, so I had no friends.  If BabySpawn proves himself to be responsible, I will give him those freedoms (of course within moderation) that I did not have - such as sleepovers, getting to swim at friends' houses, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know how you feel.  I was 100% "omg I need to breastfeed my baby" and when I simply couldn't do it (for various reasons) I decided to first supplement, then switch completely to formula.  And I *did* feel like I failed myself.  And my baby.  I was literally crying in the pediatrician's office when I told her I started supplementing.  She took my hand and told me in the calmest, kindest voice ever, "Fed is best.  They all grow."  And though I knew this, I used to *say* this to everyone...hearing her say that touched me and I just felt relief.  So, whatever you decide to do, I applaud you.  But just know this: **you are not a failure**.

Talking and posting here will def help you.  I only wish that I had known what Reddit was when I had a tiny newborn.  It would have probably saved me SO much suffering.

<TEXT> When I started working at AcmeCorps, I was introduced to everyone on my shift by my supervisor, and given a little blurb about what he or she did.  Ronnie was mostly professional when describing everyones functions and providing a little anecdote about their personalities.  Everyone smiled and laughed.  But when he came to Betty, he wrinkled his nose and gave a stilted, short statement  She sends faxes and orders supplies.  No joking or kidding there.  Betty didnt acknowledge us, either, but instead kept herself busy with her paper filing.

After wed moved past the intros and back into Ronnies office to go over the last bits of remaining paperwork, I cautiously broached the topic.  So.  That Betty is the quiet one in the office?

Ronnie looked me dead in the eyes.  Leave her to her own devices.  She doesnt get along with anyone, but she hasnt really given me a reason to fire her.  Ronnie seemed annoyed, but I let it go.  I was new, and I didnt want to make waves.  We finished our paperwork and Ronnie took me back out to the main floor.  He seated me at a computer in my new, small office and showed me how to complete a few invoices.  When I was done, I was to give all of my invoices to Betty.

After completing all of my tasks, I took my small stack of papers to Betty.  Hey, Betty.  Im Gerald.  Im the new guy.  Just wanted to give you my work for faxing.  Should I leave it anyplace in particular?  She looked up from her tasks, pale yellow sweater smudged with some dust and an almost animal wariness in her eyes.  Right over there in the inbox.  Thanks, she responded curtly, then she went back to her work.

Okay, great, no problem, thanks for taking care of these, I replied.  What can I say, I may not want to create waves, but Im not rude either.

Betty didnt seem too weird, shoved in a corner with towering boxes of old invoices waiting to be shipped away to a long-term storage facility.  Her desk looked like it didnt belong there, but it was the only place they could put her, away from everyone.  Despite the warnings, I felt bad for her.  So, every day for the next couple of weeks I made it a point to make small talk with her.  At first, she barely responded, but she eventually warmed up to me.  We started to eat lunch together.  I talked openly about my family; my wife and 2 kids.  She just sat and listened.

Betty started to talk to me during the day on the floor.  Shed call over to me to ask if Id bring her a coffee, if Id made sure fresh paper for the day had been brought out, things like that.  People started to tease me about her being my work wife but never, ever in front of her.  I laughed at their jokes and agreed.

One Friday night Betty and I had to work late because of a snowstorm.  Everyone had either worked from home or left already, but I had volunteered to stay.  I didnt realize Betty had, either.  Everything was pretty usual until I brought my paperwork over meaning to fax everything myself.  There sat Betty at her desk behind the boxes.  I hadnt seen her until then.  She was wearing a lacy red bra and panties and nothing else.  Im your work wife, arent I? she whispered.  I gasped.  Before I could react, she stood and wrapped her arms around me.  My paperwork fluttered to the floor.  She kissed me fiercely.  I tried to resist.  I dont think I kissed her back.  Im still not sure.  But I did break free.

B-BettyIm married, and I dont think this isappropriate, I managed to say.  I backed up and ran down the hallway, out front door and into the snow.  I dove in my car and locked the doors.  Snow flew inside with me, soaking everything.  Dimly, I could see movement through the snow swirling around outside.

Holy crap, it was Betty still wearing only that lacy underwear and following me to my car.  She started pounding on the windows for me to let her in.  She was crying.  After a few minutes, she wasnt slowing down and I didnt want her to freeze to death, so I opened the door.  She climbed in, shivering.  I reached into the backseat and threw her a blanket, which she wrapped around herself.  She reached for me again, and I gently pushed her back.

Betty, you have made my days here wonderful, but you are just my friend.  Im sorry that we can never be more than that.  I hope, somehow, we can still remain friends.  Im willing to forget this ever happened, and I wont mention it to anyone.  Nobody will ever know, I said, my eyes searching her face.

As I spoke, the fire left Bettys eyes and she stared at me dully.  Of course, Gerry.  Iunderstand.  I was wrong.  Her voice was flat, and her shoulders sagged.  Her body conveyed complete and utter defeat.  I patted her shoulder gently and offered to walk her inside.  She did not resist or comment.

While Betty got dressed, I completed the rest of my work and tidied up my office.  I chatted with her as normally as I possibly could as she faxed the paperwork.  I kept glancing out the window, hoping the snow would subside enough for me to try to make it home.  She followed my line of sight.  Hey listen.  Why dont you head home?  I can finish up this faxing and Ill lock up.  I smiled at her and said my simple, quick goodbyes.  I cleaned off my car and slowly made my way home.

The weekend went well.  Building snowmen with the kids, enjoying my family.  I really had all but forgotten the strange encounter with Betty.  When Monday rolled around I headed into my building holding a box of donuts for everyone.  I set the box down in the front of the room and headed to my office.  I opened my door and switched on the lights.  My brain refused to register what happened next.  All I remember is that I first gagged, then started yelling and the rest is kind of a blur.  Ronnie filled me in later.

You see, sometime after I left, Betty had changed back into her red lacy panties and entered my office.  She had carved the words work wife into her stomach with my letter opener and proceeded to slit her wrists.  Somehow she had managed to cut deep enough to bleed out, but not so deep that it was instantly.  She had time walk around my office, and touch everything.  In her own blood, she had smeared on my wall, You will never forget.  But thats not the strangest thing.

Apparently Betty had taken my family portrait and had pasted her face over my wifes.  She took the photo of my wife sitting on our deck and Betty drew all kinds of swiggles and x-marks all over it.  On the back of the frame, Betty had written, Soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You might be too low/high to queue for instances, but maybe you can get a group of friends to run it with you a couple of times to get the requirements you need.  Or, you can do a couple of quests or buy some gear on the AH.

I've never not had this problem when leveling, unfortunately.  Especially, I think, b/c I use the heirloom gear and that ilvl isn't always comparable to the gear that actually drops out of instances, even if it is "better."  Usually I get stuck around MoP though.

Good luck, though!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello,

I am new here.  Just found this sub and I've been lurking for a week or so.  I started doing a keto diet in April of last year.  I've gone from super strict to kind of loosely following it and back to strict again, and in that time, as of today, I have officially lost 36 lbs!!  It's amazing, and I'm thinner in a way I never have been before.  Though I have weighed less in the past, my measurements are much different!  It's shocking and amazing.

I started my journey doing Transformation 360.  I had no idea that it was actually a "thing" outside of that program until my husband saw my success, wanted to join in, then found and told me about this sub.  I'm really looking forward to reading more and getting some ideas about different things to eat.

Thank you for this community, and for allowing me to be a part of it :) </TEXT>

But, the previous story said
Im homeless because I was a stubborn twenty-year-old trying to make it out on my own. I had family waiting for me back home, but I wasnt ready to crawl back to my family yet. Like I said, Im a stubborn guy. I would rather die than beg my parents to take me back.

As far as Lularoe, I hated it -- at first.  I thought all of the patterns were ugly (  this is coming from someone who has a very unique and funky style sense) - UNTIL ONE DAY I found a pair of Space Invader leggings.  WELL, now it's my personal quest to find all the leggings like that xD

I don't like/wear any of the other options, but some of them are cute.  Actually in one of the groups I'm in shows one of the dress-things as work-wear.  I guess it's all in how you accessorize lol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, mom who did the helmet stuff here.

Firstly, I'm sure you know that having a flat spot does not in any way harm your son's brain.  He will be just fine that way.  Secondly, if your doctor said there was nothing to worry about, I'm sure he's probably correct.  Ours talked to us b/c it was pretty extremely noticeable.  (Even more so when we saw the "before" and "after" scans when everything was said and done.)  After all of the helmet and therapy we did, it's still not perfect.  We didn't expect it to be, but now it's not noticeable to anyone except us.  And the little it's off now?  Can be disguised with a haircut.  (Or not, b/c that kid has so much freakin' hair.)

Did you ever Google what some flat spots can cause kids to look like?  Sooo...I'm sure you're baby's head is nothing like that :P  And some flat-ness is extremely common these days b/c of the whole "Back to Sleep" campaign.  Additionally, most of that *does* correct itself by the time the kiddo is 3.

You'll be fine, and so will he.  Don't beat yourself up about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's hard to say without knowing his reason for doing this.   But I like to hope that most people aren't total jerks, so I'm going to guess he just doesn't like chowder.  (Which is stupid, bc yum.)

Did you mention you were cooking chowder for dinner beforehand?  If he doesn't like it, I don't think it's rude that he doesn't eat it.

For example, I LOATHE tunafish.  Like, my throat will close off and I will gag and I just can't ew it stinks.  Nope.  Went down the shore w/ best friends.  Said I wanted to go out to eat in front of everyone.  Nobody said anything contrary to this, nobody said they were going to make dinner.  Dinnertime comes, and tuna salad is served.  I cannot even sit at the table b/c I cannot take the smell.  I mumbled an apology, and I left to get my own food.

I guess what I'm saying is maybe it's the same for him and he doesn't want to offend you?  And he thinks he's helping by making (  paying for) his own stuff?

I saw that you mentioned he doesn't clean up well - just flat out say you don't mind if he makes his own food, but just be sure to clean up after himself. </TEXT>

Yes, he decided to download his teeth into the natural wood frame and now has taken a noticeable CHUNK out of it (  I guess swallowed the splinters?!)  I tied some cloth around the spot to prevent him from getting to it again (it's only this one spot; I guess it was the most flavourful?) but like, WHAT?

On the plus side, I do feel little bits of tooth coming in on tops and bottoms, so hopefully those molars will be bustin' out soon! </TEXT>

I'm not entirely sure about the comments of your post, though.  I guess an unofficial perk of being in a guild is that you can be carried through dungeons and funneled gear you didn't necessarily earn.

Imo, this person doesn't sound like someone you should worry too much about.  Block and move on to working on your guild. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You pay to play.  You should be having fun.  If you're not, then you're essentially paying to suffer.  For those guildmates that you're both friendly with, add them to your B-Net   explain why you are leaving if you'd like.  Then, leave.  You owe the rest of the guild nothing.  If the game is not fun for you but they are enjoying themselves, having your dps shouldn't make or break them.

Join that other guild that offered you a spot.  Or try out a couple different guilds until you find one that fits.  You still have plenty of time before ToS so you should find someplace that works for the both of you :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Breakfast I made 2 scrambled eggs (can be any style though) with some combination of onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, asparagus, or spinach.  Cooked with a small amt of vegetable oil.  I use various different Mrs. Dash spices.

Lunch is always a salad b/c it's the easiest to make and take to work.  Lettuce, onions, carrots, mushrooms, celery, usually chicken (but sometimes steak or hamburger, depending on what was for dinner the night before.)  Apple Cider Vinegar and Vegetable Oil for dressing.

Dinner is a meat (chicken, steak, salmon, lean hamburger no buns!), and a veggie.  (NO CORN!  String beans, peas, broccoli, onions, mushrooms, etc.)

There *are* vegan versions of this, if that's your thing, but I don't know what they are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll keep mine brief but if you're wanting more details please feel free to inbox me.  I started a keto diet at the end of last April.  I've been on-and-off strictly faithful to it (usually in about 3-month chunks, then I will take a couple of weeks or so and eat all the things b/c hey, I like to holiday and birthday lol.)  In that time (what will actually be a year at the end of this April) I have lost 35 lbs and kept it off, even with the cheat-times.  I am skinnier in a way that I never was before, even when I had time to go to the gym and run 2 miles a day.  I feel better mentally and physically.  When I'm on it 100% I do not have lingering pain in my hip that I sometimes have.  I have more energy.  I feel like I'm in high school again.  My skin looks amazing.

Starting it sucks.  Hard.  The first 2-3 weeks are sheer hell as you first get through your sugar/carb cravings and adjust to portion control.  You might stab someone.  But you get through it and you feel so much better; you do not crave; you actually feel FULL after eating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for posting this, b/c I often think about it but I haven't really asked about it as I'm still quite a bit aways from this.  This is what I've been thinking myself.  I did not have a lot of freedoms when I was growing up (though I was a very good kid, never got into trouble) so I was pretty sheltered, whereas my husband had virtually no restrictions (and yet somehow he was a basically good kid, would only occasionally get into trouble.)  We want to have a happy medium of the 2 styles of parenting.

1.)  I was thinking I'd let BabySpawn play in our backyard alone around 5, maybe next door with the neighbor kids, though there is a couple of years' age difference, so I'm not sure they'd even be interested in him.  Also he'd be out there with our dog.  We live in a quite, nice neighbourhood.

2.)  10 years old for a quick 15-20 min, 12+ for longer.  (There are no laws in my state for a minimum age to be alone.)

3.)  6+, but I would have to meet the parents first, and I'd be dropping BabySpawn off.

4.)  Our walk to what will be BabySpawn's K-4th grade isn't very far but I intend to walk with him at least until 4th grade.  This one I probably won't even stop doing unless he asks to walk alone.

Overall though I think it will depend on BabySpawn's mentality and behavior when he's old enough for this even to matter. </TEXT>

That's a really good idea.  I need to steal this.  When BabySpawn would cry in his seat and nothing I could do would help, I would just turn up the radio to try to drown him out.  Most of the time he would stop and listen.  Which is prob why when the Backstreet Boys came on the other day, he was singing with them, "Bye-bye." bye-bye-bye lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to agree with the ladies who posted here.

1- Take care of yourself.  Please go see a doctor and get meds if you need them.  When you are in a better frame of mind, you can face so much more than you ever thought.  Speaking from experience...just taking daily vitamins (and yes, one of them is Vitamin D!) helped me do a mental 180^o

2 - Set a routine for Baby.  Doesn't matter when you do it, or what exactly you do, but the main thing is that you are consistent.  (We do snack, bathtime, jammies, story, Twinkle Star, bed.)  We start at the same time every night and BabySpawn is generally in the crib at the same time every night.  If your sleeping is happening during the day, invest in a room-darkening shade.  The difference of sleep between having this vs not is freaking shocking.  I have personally witnessed it myself.

3 - Good luck.  You are brave and strong and incredible for taking care of a baby alone.  Please remember this. </TEXT>

Sure, we'd be colouring or something in front of it, but it was always on.  Didn't bother us at all.  We turned out fine.

Heck, even now I will put BabySpawn in front of the computer or TV with cartoons on so he can watch and I can get some chores done.  It's not that big a deal. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Celebrating Easter (The Basket, the Eggs, the Stuff!) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-06 19:09:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Kiddo is 15 months old, and this year I want to start an Easter tradition (even though my husband and I are not Catholic) with the basket, hiding eggs, stuff like that.

But, I don't want to go too crazy b/c he's only 15 months and I'm not really sure how much he'll be interested.  (He was 12 mo at Christmas and could care less about presents.  I honestly hoped he'd rip paper or something, but no lol.  So I don't want to set my expectation bar too high.)

I was thinking of getting a basket with a new swimsuit (which would be a thing until he was older; then maybe a highly desired sweatshirt or something), a box of snacks (again, this could evolve to preference with age), and a new toy for outside (yet another thing that could 'grow' with the kiddo.)  I want to do a super-mini Easter Egg Hunt - literally hide like 2 eggs and walk him over to them to show him.

My question is, is that enough?  Will he "get" it?  Will he be even remotely interested, or should I just shelf this until next year and he's over 2? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I almost never vote at all.  I will only down-vote if the story doesn't make sense and has a ton of grammatical flaws.  (Please note when I say "doesn't make sense" I don't mean that I don't get it.  I read the comments if I missed something and if I still don't understand, I'll just leave it alone.)  I only up-vote if the story really, really gets to me.  Though, I've gotten better with using my "power" lately, throwing more positive up-votes out there b/c now I realize that there's not some kind of limit on how much you can up-vote.

It is really, really crushing when I post a story and it's getting nothing but down votes right away, so they got almost no attention.  Actually I've noticed for the past month or so this has been the case.

I don't believe that everything I write should have thousands of upvotes, but I really wish I knew why that was happening.  Are my stories not dark enough?  Not believable?  Did you just not like it?  Where am I missing the mark?  I feel like the stories I try on get nothing but the bullshit ones I write get upvotes.  It's weird and makes it hard to improve. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Clog in My Pipes is Pretty Serious </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-03 23:09:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> No joke.  Its April 1st and my second wife of only 4 months is doing laundry.  Shes trying to finish cleaning the house because shes having people over for my birthday later tonight.  When suddenly, the pipe backs up, expelling soapy water all over the floor of our basement.  When the previous owners of our house remodeled, they thought that it would be a good idea to leave the grey accordion pipe of the washing machine unattached and just placed into a larger black pipe that attaches to the sewer pipe.  This is where all that water came spilling from.


To my wifes credit, she cleans it up herself while Im at the hardware store buying a new doorbell, but she doesnt know how to fix the clog.  I really love her.  She's stunning, but not that bright.  We met by chance at a local bar.  She was new in town, and I was her first new friend.  Then, something more.


I dont know what happened, she tells me as I come through the front door.  I didnt realize the water was spilling out, and now I keep hearing a strange snuffling noise coming from the pipes.  Like I said, gorgeous but not too bright.


I tell her not to worry.  Ive had this happen in the past, so I know I can handle this.  I place an old paint tray under the pipe access cap and use my pipe wrench to loosen the cap.  Foul, swamp-smelling water starts pouring out over the edges in little rivulets.  For smelling like it does, the water is surprisingly clear.  As the paint tray fills, I replace the cap and dump the water into a bucket.  I repeat this process a few times, until Im able to dump a little Drano into the opening.  I hear some moaning.  Just the air in the pipes, I reassure my wife.


After about 20 minutes, I fill the bucket with hot water and head to the kitchen sink.  I tell my wife to place her hand over the opening of the black pipe where the water originally spilled from, and she complies.  I start dumping the hot water down the drain.  At first nothing happens, but I know things will start moving along soon enough.  I hear my wife gasp in surprise from downstairs.  I-its starting to suck my hand a little, she calls.  I assure her that this is natural.  The water still floats in the kitchen sink, but I can see the clog is going to be loosening soon.  She cries out again.  The hot water starts to move, swirling in the sink.  The suction is now strong, very strong.  She sobs.


I run down the steps to check our progress.  I see that her left hand, the hand that she had placed over the pipe opening, has now been sucked down the pipe.  Her arm is now down that pipe up to her elbow.  Red blood has sprayed against the white paint on the wall.  She is pulling, pulling.  But so is the suction.  She turns to me, eyes wide with shock.  Every time she tugs back, more of her arm gets pulled down the pipe.  She pulls up a bit; I can see bone.  All her flesh has been melted away.  P-pleasehelp mee she begs.  I lick my lips.  I hear crackles and snaps.  That would be her bone, I think.


Her arm is yanked even further down, now to mid-bicep.  The flesh is purpling, bruising, practically bursting with blood with no place to go.  Another tug and her arm is gone up to her shoulder.  At this point shes screaming, so its a good thing were in the basement.  Somehow, it pulls, and pulls, and suddenly shes missing her arm completely.  Blood is spraying everywhere, incredibly red.  She struggles feebly as I hold her open wound over the pipe, and her blood is sucked down the drain.  After an eternity, it seems like she stops struggling.


I drag her to the manhole cover in my basement.  That was another lovely edition from the previous homeowners.  I unlock the cap, and roll my wifes body into the opening.  The growling from the pipes is louder without the lid, but it stops seconds after I hear the wet plop of my wifes body landing on something.  I love you, honey.  Until next time, I call down as I carefully replace the cover and lock.  My first wife can be so serious sometimes, especially about eating.  She never has time for small talk during that time.


I leave the grey accordion pipe out of its larger black pipe hookup.  Good thing the tentacles will come out and clean up the blood, before my family  no, my fellow cultists  come over.  After all, its my birthday. </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU By Wanting to Clean My House... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-03 17:13:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Well actually it was yesterday, but now I can laugh about it b/c it was yesterday.  (Mostly.  I am still crying inside.)

Friday night BabySpawn was throwing up at my parents' house.  It only lasted a few hours, but it sucked.  Saturday I didn't feel quite right, but I didn't throw up or pee out of my butt.  Mostly lazed around the house.  Sunday I decided that I was going to give our house a much-needed spring cleaning before my family comes over for birthday cake.  (Tuesday is my birthday.)  Therein lies my fuckup.

I scrub my bathroom and powder room.  I'm talking wipe down all the little spots you never do on a weekly basis.  I lovingly clean like I used to when I was single and bored.  I'm so proud of myself.  I've cleaned both bathrooms and changed the sets (matching shower curtain, soap dispensers, etc.)  I breathe a sigh of relief.  I vacuum, and steam clean our floors.  (Meanwhile Husband is upstairs taking a nap and BabySpawn is in his highchair eating lunch and watching Bubble Guppies, laughing and happy.  DogSpawn is underfoot, waiting for the inevitable food to drop.)

Husband wanders into the bathroom pale af.  Moans a few times, saying he's going to be sick.  I tell him to relax, and I leave b/c guys, I cannot handle puke.  WELL...A GROWN ASS MAN manages to miss the toilet and pukes all over my freshly cleaned WALL and toilet.  NOPE.COM - I tell him as nice as possible to plz clean up the chunks b/c I cannot.  (Which he does.)  He goes back to laying down.  RIP my clean bathroom.  I wipe down everything he just destroyed.  BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE.

I go to check the dog and baby, wanting to put DogSpawn outside so he can potty.  I notice DogSpawn is covered in some kind of weird brown splatters.  Which I don't understand b/c BabySpawn was eating buttered pasta; nothing brown like that.  I go over to BabySpawn, who is still laughing to Shimmer   Shine...I notice the same brown goo all over his sock.  AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW - IT WAS POOP!

I drag the dog outside and hose him off, then let him loose in the backyard.  I pick up BabySpawn from the chair and take him directly to my freshly cleaned tub ;_; wherein brown water starts to immediately seep from BabySpawn's pants...(*Dies*)  I strip BabySpawn and start rinsing his clothes and give him a bath.  DURING THIS...Husband rushes in, mumbles, "I'm sorry...BAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRFFFFFFFFF!"  (At least he got it all in the toilet.)  I start gagging but I hold it all in by some miracle.  Husband runs away again.  I finish up with BabySpawn, get him all dressed as a I text my family to not come over b/c Husband is not feeling well.  I take all the padding off the highchair and throw it in the washing machine.  I take my bathroom rug that now has poopy footprints from BabySpawn all over it and wipe it off as best as I can, and throw that in the washing machine.  I bleach my tub (again.)  BUT WAIT THERE IS MORE!

I go into our bedroom to tell Husband that we're just going to go to my parents' house instead, I need to hop in the shower b/c I feel like I'm covered in puke and poop.  "Okay,' he mumbles.  "But just so you know, while you were washing BabySpawn, I had really bad diarrhea in the power room downstairs."

And that, folks, is why I am never spring cleaning my house again.  T___T </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't play Neopets when I was 11.  I started when I was maybe 16?  I rarely went to the boards even then b/c I wasn't interested in it.  I wasn't implying 11-year-olds are infants, so not sure where got that idea..

The main points I was trying to make is that board-access isn't "required" to play so if OP doesn't want to make a new account or ask her niece's parents to sign the form, it's not a huge deal.  The second point was that maybe, being 11, she wouldn't care and only want to play he games or what-have-you.  e_e </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there!

If you're considering WoW you might want to check out /r/wownoob to find other newbies or have your questions answered.

Having said that, you might enjoy playing a Rogue or possibly Shaman, though Shaman do have magic they are melee with a tiny bit of ranged.  There's no *real* difference between races.  It's mostly visual, so just pick what design you like the best.  (Master Draenei race, though.) </TEXT>

My brother, who dates some chick that drives an ambulance or something, is about as different from me as night is different from day.  Yeah.  Its clich but Im not a writing major.  Im a Sophomore in high school and I dont care what you think about how I write.  Im doing my best to actually type out all the words correctly because normally I type 1yk3 d15 0nl1n3.  No, Im not trolling you.  All of the people in my guild do it, because its funny mess with n00bs.


So my brother goes out and does his thing but I like to stay home and play video games.  Doesnt matter what game, I do it.  All I ever ask for on my birthday or Christmas is a new gaming system or new games.  Or computer part upgrades.  (Because PC Master race, amiright?!  Lolol kekekek huehuehue)  And guess what?  My parents buy them for me because Im a god-mode student.  I get straight As in my Honors Classes.  Some of them I earned.  Maybe one or two I fixed using my knowledge of Photoshop.  They were Bs that could have been As but I cant miss my raid times, and I cant miss my Call of Duty war games so I guess I have to miss studying sometimes.


The only thing my parents really say to me is that they wish Id go outside more, maybe play a sport but yeah right, I dont want to strap 10 pounds of pads to my skinny ass frame (thanks, genetics!  I can eat what I want and it doesnt matter!) just to get tackled by some big fatty.  No thanks.  And besides I can always play sports games on any of the systems I have.  I rarely do, but I CAN.  Other than that they leave me alone.


Well, yesterday I turned 16 so my parents thought it would be nice to buy me a new cell phone (??) because we got this new carrier called P-Mobile.  Not exactly what I wanted, but so far the app selection is pretty interesting.   Theres a few in here that I havent heard of before.  I downloaded a couple of the free versions.  I messed around with the phones features.


This phone came standard with a VR (virtual reality for you non-1337 p33p5) program and headset.  I turned it on and tried it out.  It was just a free trial.  It showed me in a warehouse.  I looked around and I saw a couple of werido, rotting corpse things standing in the corner.  As I noticed them, they noticed me.  Zombies!  I laughed and cheered because this was going to be awesome.  But as they drew near, the game kind of froze and an ad popped up, asking if I wanted to download the full version, bonus levels, if I wanted to order some special gun weapon controllers.  Um, yes?  I took the VR set off my head and ordered a few things.  Set that to ship to me overnight.  Cause my parents want me to be happy, right?  Happy 16th birthday!


The next day my packages come and I tear right into them.  I hefted the first gun up, admiring it.  It was made of this heavy plastic-ish stuff.  I strapped the fake knife to my thigh.  And yes, before you criticize me, I took it out of the sheath and ran it over the ball of my thumb.  It was plastic and didnt cut anything.  Sheesh.


I go ahead and insert this little simcard thing into my phone  the full version of the Zombie Apocalypse game.  (Weird, I didnt know phones even had that feature and Im pretty 5M4rT when it comes to this stuff.)  The phone gives a little ping! notification when its done, and it took like 5 seconds to install.  I strap it into the VR set and I sit down in my chair in my bedroom.


I enter the game in the same weird warehouse.  I look around and start moving all while sitting in my chair.  Guys  I didnt fucking move I swear from that chair.  I go about demolishing zombies and shit and its great.  Highscore!  Hell yes Ill post this to my InstaFace account!  Let me drink in the likes from my fellow gamers and jealous classmates.  I played for a long time.  I got maybe, halfway through the game.  I was destroying zombies left and right, finding more ammo, plowing through it all.  I found some snacks in the game, like soda and pizza that I would eat and it replenished my healthbar.  Basic, but I could almost taste the flavours on my tongue.  All the while trying to explore this building, and I guess find a way out?  I collect a few quests along the way, like one from a cute NPC girl in the beginning who died (RIP LOLOLOL) about finding a cure or some junk.  Im going through and I just realized that I had lost track of time.  The game seemed so real.


I switched the game off, and laid my weapons down and removed the VR set from my head.  Man, my palms were sweaty af holding onto that gun and knife so tightly.


WAIT.  WHAT IS THIS?  My arms up to my elbows are covered in blood.  Like, red and green blood and bits ofgreyish squishy stuffthat might just bezombie brains??  I looked around my room again, and saw zombie bodies piled up around my chair.  Some with knife wounds.  Some with bullet holes.  All not moving.  Blood all over the walls.  My bed was knocked over.  But Ithe game is off!  I glanced next to me, and on my little TV tray where crumbled cans of soda and pizza crusts.  GuysI didnt have snacks with me when I started.  The soda didnt have a brand name on it.  It was just a red can.


I kind of greyed out here for a bit.  When I looked around again, the sun was shining very brightly in through my window, which was weird because it only does that in the morning.and I started playing this game in the early afternoon.  I cautiously looked around again, literally petrified of what I was going to see.


My room looked.completely normal.  No zombie corpses.  I wasnt covered in blood.  My bed was neatly made in the corner.  (What?  Im a gamer not a savage!)  Had I justfallen asleep?  I glanced at the TV tray.  Aside from a few crumbs, it was empty.  


I shifted in my chair, and I could feel the cramps of siting in a chair all night complaining.  Maybe I needed to take a break from this game.  I mean, I didnt even remember falling asleep.  Placing my cell phone and VR headset on the tray, I stood up and stretched.  My foot kicked something.  I looked down.  It was a crushed red soda can.  Sticking from the mouth opening was a piece of notebook paper.  I bent down and picked it up.  It had 4 tasks written down in my hand writing; one of them was crossed off:


*  Completely explore the warehouse.
*  Rescue 5 survivors.  Bonus:  Rescue 10 survivors.
*  Discover cure vial.
*  ~~Collect 3 zombie eyes.~~


I touched my pocket softly.  It squished.  I reached in and pulled out 3 faded, cataract clouded eyes.  I gagged.  What was this?  In my confused time of stress, all my poor mind could come up with was this  My cell phones VR is incredible!  I felt sanity slip.  I passed out again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He was my best friend, and I killed him.  If I am to be honest, I must say the truth, even if it hurts.  I must give this confession now, before it is too late.  Only the gods know when it will be too late.

Dolan was a blonde haired, blue eyed farm boy.  Me, I am a brunette half-angel.  Back then my wings were pure white.  We met each other by the blessing of the Sun God.  We were both training to be Paladins of the Light.  We, along with several others, heard the call and decided to dedicate our lives and Souls to Him above all other gods.  Paladins are special warriors that are adept at weaponry, but are also able to call down our chosen gods powers to assist us in small ways.

We made our way through our training with little problem.  We helped each other learn our spells, and I helped Dolan master some more complex swordplay.  When we were to graduate and adventure on our own, it was only natural that we decided to travel together and spread the word of the Sun God to all who would listen.

And so it was, for several years.  In my eyes, we were just two best friends.  Nothing more.  I never saw that Dolan wanted more than this.  I never had a clue.  I guess I did not know him as well as I thought I did.

Then came that fateful week.  We arrived just after dark to a small village in the middle of a forest.  It was not marked on our maps, but that was not unusual for us.  Oftentimes little villages would spring up out of nowhere.  We were welcomed by the villagers with open arms, but one villager in particular caught my attention.  When the villager and I made eye contact, I could feel an unfamiliar yet not unpleasant tingling all over my body.  I blushed faintly.  From the moment I saw him, I knew hed be something special to me.  

He had blonde hair so light it was almost white, pale skin, the small and pointed ears of his Elven race, and hypnotic green eyes.  The first night he kept his distance, standing in the back of the crowd as we spoke about who we were and why we were there  to spread the teachings of the Sun God.  Though I tried to look at everyone in the crowd in turn, my eye was constantly drawn back to that man.  When we were done our introductions and headed toward the villages only inn for the night, Dolan was looking at me strangely.  I had no idea what could possibly be wrong, so I imagined he was just tired from our travels.

The next week went by pretty uneventfully.  Other than my blossoming friendship with Lucius, that is.  He would always meet up with Dolan and I in the evening.  Dolan would make some choked excuse and head off most times, but I happily stayed and talked to Lucius.  He told me all about his life, and how he came to be in this village.  Finally on Friday he confessed his feelings to me.  I was ecstatic!  I ran to tell Dolan that I thought it would be a good idea to invite Lucius to travel with us.  After all, Lucius had been extremely interested in us and our Sun God.  Lucius had even said that he was considering becoming a paladin as well!  I could be his sponsor!

Unfortunately, Dolan did not take the news so well.   He cried and screamed and begged, saying that he loved me, that I should be with him, and not to trust Lucius.  Dolan insisted that Lucius was hiding something.  I began to get angry as well.  I had told Dolan before that we were and would always be just friends.  That we could be nothing more.  I left the inn room after that and lingered downstairs in the common area for a while.  I never saw Dolan leave the room.

Sighing, I decided to head toward the clearing in the woods that we had come across before we entered the village with the idle thought of hoping that Lucius would show up.  That was probably foolish, because it was well past midnight, but sleep was going to be evading me for a while.  Maybe I would just sleep in the clearing itself

I knew something was wrong the moment the small clearing came into view.  The moonlight streaming down and filtering through the maple tree leaves seemed innocent enough, but I noticed that there were no sounds.  No scuttle of animal feet as they foraged for food.  No sweet music of crickets chirping.  Nothing.  The air itself seemed to hold its breath, as if waiting for me.  Instinctively, my hand fell to my sword as I walked forward, fully on the defensive.

Slowly, I edged up to the clearing, but didnt quite enter it.  Crouching behind a rose bush, the scent filling my nostrils with a heady feeling, I saw Dolan standing over Lucius, Dolans sword drawn and dripping with Luciuss blood.  Gasping softly, I hesitated for only a moment as anger washed over me.  Before I could react, Dolan drew breath to speak.

You lied to her, and I will expose you for the villain that I know you to be, Lucius!  You may have blinded her, but not so with me!  I will show her the truth, and your terrible plotting will be revealed!  Dolan shouted.  Then muttering to himself, he said, And she will love me for it.

Chuckling softly, Lucius drew a deep breath, and a new light lit his eyes.  You are more of a fool than she is, you know.  You have no idea, absolutely no idea, what you are dealing with, do you, boy?
	
Dolan clenched his sword tighter and moved toward Lucius.  In a flash, I was on my feet and running toward my friends, pulling my sword out of its sheath as I neared the two.  Expertly, I parried Dolans downward slash and stood guard in front of Luciuss fallen form.  Behind me, Luciuss eyes glittered.  What in the Nine Hells are you doing, Dolan?  How could you go so far as to openly attack Lucius?  Are you so blinded by your own feelings that youd sink so low?  My voice was all steel.

Dolan stared into my face with disbelief.  Still, you doubt me?  You would protect thisthing, this abomination!  Why should I ever lie to you, Crystal?  I only want to keep you safe!  You know this is true.  You know how I feel  you know I love you!

Watching the moonlight fall on Dolans hair and face, something inside my stomach tightened and I faltered for a moment. Dolan, I began, my tone soft.  I  Behind me Lucius coughed feebly, and I snapped back to reality.

Lucius was going to die, unless I defended him.  The elf I loved was going to die, because of another mans jealousy.  No, Dolan.  Love is not this way.  You have it all wrong.  But I respected you, once, and because of that, I will give you one chance to walk away.  Just go.  Do not look back, and do not ever try to come into my life again.  I have made my choice, and I am happy.  If you cannot be happy for me, then it is time we went our separate ways.  I brought my sword to bear in front of me.  I have always been the better fighter, Dolan.  Please dont make me force you to go.  Please, just go for me.

Tears started streaming down Dolans face, and seeing them made me begin to cry as well, but my grip on my sword did not waver.  Eyes on the blade, Dolan took a step forward and extended his hand.  Crystal, take my hand, and we can go together.  Leave him, you dont need him.  Hes a *vampire*, the very personification of that which we strive to destroy.  Come back to me, and come back to the Sun God.  He took another step forward and gripped his sword tighter.  Lets take care of this together.

Tensing, I swore under my breath and took my own step forward, but what happened next is forever unclear in my mind.  The next thing I knew, my sword was plunging downward into Dolans chest.  Everything seemed to slow down in that instant.  Dolan was falling.  My hands slid from my sword and moved to catch him as he fell to the ground.  Dimly, I heard laughter  was that Lucius?  did he trip me?  no, of course not, thats just being silly.

Numbly, I fell to the ground beside Dolan, his warm blood colouring the ground, my hands, everywhere, it seemed.  Slowly, Dolan turned his head to me, and his fingertips brushed my face, leaving a small bloody trail in their wake.  Y-youare so stubborn.  Im s-sorry I couldnt keep you safe this time.  Im sorry I failed, Im sorry I love His hands fell from my face and his head fell back, vacant eyes staring at the uncaring moon.  Anguish unlike any I had ever known ripped through every pore in my body, every fiber of my being.  Even my wings felt too heavy to carry me away.  I nearly blacked out from the rending pain that coursed through my body.  Time passed weirdly, and I felt a cold hand on my shoulder.  My confused mind groped for an explanation.  Ah, Lucius.  My love, come to comfort me, to tell me it was not my fault, that everything was going to be okay.

It never gets old, you know.  It always gives me a new thrill to see it.  But I think this time was my favourite.  The hand moved to my face and wiped away Dolans blood from my cheek.  It was Luciuss hand, I noted.  Turning slightly, shifting Dolan to the ground, I stared.  Lucius licked the blood from his fingertips like a spoiled cat.  Well of course he was totally right, dear.  You really should listen to your friends more carefully.  And hey, I dont want you to think were not still friends.  Im pretty much all youve got in this world now, because I dont think your precious Sun God will want the likes of you back after a murder-

Accident.  My interrupting voice was level.  It was an accident.

Oh no, I saw it with my own two eyes in vivid, delicious colour.  You slaughtered him.  You took one step and drove your sword right on through him without even hesitating.  Definitely not an accident, my dear.  Lucius laughed cruelly.

My patriarch will hear me out, he will understand!  He will help me through this, he will!

Oh, I highly doubt hed want to see you right now, looking the way you do.  But I must say, those black wings are so much better than the way the used to be.  White was never really your colour, girl.

My wings?  I turned my head slightly and moved my left wing into my vision.  The tip of it was black, and it seemed that the stain was spreading upward at each passing moment.  I sobbed.

Well, now, dont think youre all alone in this.  I have plans for you, and so does someone else Id like you to meet.  Now, dont be all worried about this, Im pretty sure that you and my boss here will be the best of friends.  Lucius stared me dead in the eyes.  In fact, Id bet my eternal life on it.

Whimpering softly, I stared at the blood on my hands.  Lucius pulled a cloth from his back pocket and wrapped it around his hand.  Placing a foot on Dolans chest for leverage, he pulled out my sword and dropped it, steaming, onto the grass beside me.  Ill just take care of this for you, help you out here, okay?

Slowly I nodded, still unable to comprehend all that had happened.  Where did I have to turn?  Where else could I go?  Lucius was right  my Patriarch would be horrified at what had happened.  Even if it was an accident, clear as day, he wouldnt want to hear it, wouldnt want to listen.  No, there was no place for me in town any longer.  Better to go with Lucius, meet this boss of his.  Who knew what kind of Demon or Devil would be a vampires boss, butPerhaps he would take care of me.  Hide from the Sun.  The dark was safer.

It wasnt until years later that I realized how foolish and childish that hope was.  I killed my best friend, and lost my innocence all in one breathless minute.

<TITLE> I Accidentally Killed My Best Friend </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> He was my best friend, and I killed him.  If Im to be honest, I must say the truth, even if it hurts.  I must give this confession now, before its too late.  Only the gods know when it will be too late.


Dolan was a blonde haired, blue eyed farm boy.  Me, Im a brunette, green eyed girl.  Back then my Soul was pure white.  We met each other by a stroke of luck.  We were both training to be entertainers.  We, along with several others, heard the call and decided that maybe the circus life might be for us.  Maybe its corny, but we enjoyed acting and doing stunts.  We were thrill seekers.


We made our way through our training with little problem.  We helped each other learn our acts, write our skits, and I helped Dolan master some more complex wordplay.  Comedy was never his strong suit.  His delivery time was awful.  After graduation, it was only natural that we decided to travel together and try to get famous doing our 2-man show of comedy and drama that wed perfected over the years wed been in school.  We figured wed try this before joining up with a huge organization.  Ah, youth.


And so it was, for several years.  In my eyes, we were just two best friends.  Nothing more.  I never saw that Dolan wanted more than this.  I never had a clue.  I guess I didnt know him as well as I thought I did.


Then came that fateful week.  We arrived just after dark to a small town by the side of a dusty, forgotten road.  It wasnt marked on our maps, but that didnt deter us.  After all, we enjoyed adventure.  We were welcomed by everyone with open arms, but one man in particular caught my attention.  When he and I made eye contact, I could feel an unfamiliar yet not unpleasant tingling all over my body.  I blushed faintly.  From the moment I saw him, I knew hed be something special to me.  


He had blonde hair so light it was almost white, pale skin, and hypnotic green eyes.  The first night he kept his distance, standing in the back of the crowd as we spoke about who we were and why we were there  to put on a little show in the park if we were able.  This town didnt get many visitors, so they were excited.  While speaking, I tried to look at everyone in the crowd in turn, but my eye was constantly drawn back to that man.  When we were done our introductions and headed toward the towns only inn for the night, Dolan was looking at me strangely.  I had no idea what could possibly be wrong, so I imagined he was just tired from our travels.


The next week went by pretty uneventfully.  Other than my blossoming friendship with Lucius, that is.  He would always meet up with Dolan and I in the evening.  Dolan would make some choked excuse and head off most times, but I happily stayed and talked to Lucius.  He told me all about his life, and how he came to be in this town.  Finally, on Friday he confessed his feelings to me.  I was ecstatic!  I ran to tell Dolan that I thought it would be a good idea to invite Lucius to travel with us.  After all, Lucius had been extremely interested in us and had previous acting experience.  I had seen a few newspaper clippings with his reviews, though they were all from this tiny towns theater.  Everyone starts somewhere, right?


Unfortunately, Dolan didnt take the news so well.   He cried and screamed and begged, saying that he loved me, that I should be with him, and not to trust Lucius.  Dolan insisted that Lucius was hiding something.  I began to get angry as well.  I had told Dolan before that we were and would always be just friends.  That we could be nothing more.  I left the inn room after that and lingered downstairs in the common area for a while.  I never saw Dolan leave.


Sighing, I decided to head toward the towns small park with the idle thought of hoping that Lucius would show up.  That was probably foolish, because it was well past midnight, but sleep was going to be evading me for a while.  Maybe I would just sleep in our old, dusty car


I knew something was wrong the moment the open field of the park came into view.  The moonlight streaming down and filtering through the maple tree leaves seemed innocent enough, but I noticed that there were no sounds.  No scuttle of animal feet as they foraged for food.  No sweet music of crickets chirping.  Nothing.  The air itself seemed to hold its breath, as if waiting for me.  Almost of its own violation, my hand strayed to the small pocketknife I carried with me at all times.


Slowly, I edged up to the parks field, but didnt quite enter it.  Crouching behind a rose bush, the scent filling my nostrils with a heady feeling, I saw Dolan standing over Lucius, Dolans hands clenched into fists and dripping with Luciuss blood.  Gasping softly, I hesitated for only a moment as anger washed over me.  Before I could react, Dolan drew breath to speak.


You lied to her, and I will expose you for the villain that I know you to be, Lucius!  You may have blinded her, but not so with me!  I will show her the truth, and your terrible plotting will be revealed!  Dolan shouted.  Then muttering to himself, he said, And she will love me for it.


Chuckling softly, Lucius drew a deep breath, and a new light lit his eyes.  You are more of a fool than she is, you know.  You have no idea, absolutely no idea, what you are dealing with, do you, boy?


Dolan clenched his fists even tighter and moved toward Lucius.  In a flash, I was on my feet and running toward my friends, pulling my feeble pocketknife free as I neared the two.  I figured I was going to have to bluff my way through this.  I had no intention of actually using that dinky little blade.  I yelled as I ran at them, and came to stand guard in front of Luciuss fallen form.  Behind me, Luciuss eyes glittered.  What in the Nine Hells are you doing, Dolan?  How could you go so far as to openly attack Lucius?  Are you so blinded by your own feelings that youd sink so low?  My voice was all steel.


Dolan stared into my face with disbelief.  Still, you doubt me?  You would protect thisthing, this abomination!  Why should I ever lie to you, Crystal?  I only want to keep you safe!  You know this is true.  You know how I feel  you know I love you!


Watching the moonlight fall on Dolans hair and face, something inside my stomach tightened and I faltered for a moment. Dolan, I began, my tone soft.  I  Behind me Lucius coughed pathetically, and I snapped back to reality.


Lucius was going to die, unless I defended him.  The man I loved was going to die, because of another mans jealousy.  No, Dolan.  Love is not this way.  You have it all wrong.  But I respected you, once, and because of that, I will give you one chance to walk away.  Just go.  Dont look back, and dont ever try to come into my life again.  I have made my choice, and Im happy.  If you cant be happy for me, then its time we went our separate ways.  I brought my little knife in front of me.  Please dont make me force you to go.  Please, just go for me.


Tears started streaming down Dolans face, and seeing them made me begin to cry as well, but my hands holding the pocketknife didnt waiver.  Eyes on the blade, Dolan took a step forward and extended his hand.  Crystal, take my hand, and we can go together.  Leave him, you dont need him.  Hes a *vampire*, the very personification of darkness and vileness.  Come back to me, and come back to someone who loves you.  He took another step forward.  Lets take care of this together.


Tensing, I swore under my breath.  Was this an act?  Were Dolan and Lucius practicing a new skit for the show?  Had Dolan changed his mind?  Becausevampires arent real  I took a step forward meaning to give voice to my silent questions, but what happened next is forever unclear in my mind.  The next thing I knew, my pocketknife was plunging downward into Dolans chest.  Everything seemed to slow down in that instant.  Dolan was falling.  My hands slid from my hilt of the pocketknife and moved to catch him as he fell to the ground.  Dimly, I heard laughter  was that Lucius?  did he trip me?  no, of course not, thats just being silly.


Numbly, I fell to the ground beside Dolan, his warm blood colouring the dirt, my hands, everywhere, it seemed.  Slowly, Dolan turned his head to me, and his fingertips brushed my face, leaving a small bloody trail in their wake.  Y-youare so stubborn.  Im s-sorry I couldnt keep you safe this time.  Im sorry I failed, Im sorry I love His hands fell from my face and his head fell back, vacant eyes staring at the uncaring moon.  Anguish unlike any I had ever known ripped through every pore in my body, every fiber of my being.  There was no way; it shouldnt have been possible for such an insignificant blade to reach his heart.  I nearly blacked out from the rending pain that coursed through my body.  Time passed weirdly, and I felt a cold hand on my shoulder.  My confused mind groped for an explanation.  Ah, Lucius.  My love, come to comfort me, to tell me it was not my fault, that everything was going to be okay.


It never gets old, you know.  It always gives me a new thrill to see it.  But I think this time was my favourite.  The hand moved to my face and wiped away Dolans blood from my cheek.

You really should listen to your friends more carefully.  And hey, I dont want you to think were not still friends.  Im pretty much all youve got in this world now, because I dont think youve any friends or family leftor so I remember you telling me.  A strange girl in a strange townhow many folks will stand up for you when they learn about this murder-


Accident.  My interrupting voice was level.  It was an accident.


Oh no, I saw it with my own two eyes in vivid, delicious colour.  You slaughtered him.  You took one step and drove your pocketknife right on through him without even hesitating.  Jealous of his acting talents.  Definitely not an accident, my dear.  Lucius laughed cruelly.


The-the police will hear me out, they will understand!  They will help me through this, o-or a lawyer will!


Oh, I highly doubt that youd even be able to afford a decent enough lawyer for something like this.  And thats if you even get a trialthis being such a remote, small town.  They will take my word over anything you can say.  After all, Im the only witness, and Im from here.


I could feel my sanity slowly start ripping like a fragile fabric.  The world seemed to spin sideways, and I swayed on my feet.  I nearly passed out.


Well, now, dont think youre all alone in this.  I have plans for you, and so does someone else Id like you to meet.  Now, dont be all worried about this, Im pretty sure that you and my boss here will be the best of friends.  Lucius stared me dead in the eyes.  In fact, Id bet my eternal life on it.

Placing a foot on Dolans chest for leverage, he pulled out my pocketknife and dropped it, steaming, onto the grass beside me.  Ill just take care of this for you, help you out here, okay?


Slowly I nodded, still unable to comprehend all that had happened.  Where did I have to turn?  Where else could I go?  Lucius was right  small town mentality.  Id read about it.  I was screwed.  Even if it was an accident, clear as day, nobody wouldnt want to hear it, nobody would want to listen.  No, there was no place for me in town any longer.  Better to go with Lucius, meet this boss of his.  Who knew what kind of Demon or Devil would be a vampires boss, or what possible use he could have for me, butPerhaps he would take care of me.  Hide me.


It wasnt until years later that I realized how foolish and childish that hope was.  I killed my best friend, and lost my innocence all in one breathless minute. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a cool website, www.skinnytaste.com, that you might be interested in.  They have a 30 minute meal section, (  possibly a crock pot section, too.)

I recommend for you either a FitBit (you can log your calories on your phone, or online) or My Fitness Pal (but I think I read that didn't work well for you) - or even just a regular old copybook that you write down what you eat.  Honestly that was the biggest game changer for me was seeing all the shit I was eating all day written out.  It wasn't enough for me to struggle to bend over to tie my shoes or shave my legs.  It wasn't enough that I couldn't fit into any of my clothes anymore.

Personally I am doing "Transformation 360" which involves a lot of meal prep and no exercise required.  (I prep lunches for me   my husband on Sunday nights,   breakfasts the night before.  I take something out of the freezer for dinner the night before, too.)  I don't go to the gym (though I do run/play sports).  It primarily focuses on portion control/no carbs.  If you're interested, send me a PM!

Otherwise, good luck with everything :3  I hope you find a program that works for you!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> BabySpawn is just about 15 months old now, and for the last week or so, for some reason he's decided that 6:30am is a great time to wake up screaming at the top of his lungs.  (He used to sleep until about 8:30-9am before, and had been doing this for a very long time.)  Just when I thought it wasn't going to get worse, IT DID and he decided to wake up at 5:30am screaming bloody murder today.  Well, I guess we didn't need to sleep for 2 more precious hours before work.

Not sure why my previously beautiful sleeper has gone rogue, but omg plz don't tell me this is forever /3  Please send all the coffee. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-03-22 22:20:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello, I am a 23-year-old recess supervisor at a local school.  I normally use Reddit for all kinds of cute things, like little crafts to do on rainy days and fun snacks to bake for kids.  A friend told me about this place, and encouraged me to share my story.  So, here it is.


I have been working at this job for two years, and I honestly love it.  I love kids, but as I havent found that special someone yet (not to mention that Im still kinda young, haha) I knew doing something involving children would be a great career for me.  Im working my way through college to be a Kindergarten teacher, so this recess supervisor job is a great way to get my foot in the door.  I figured that the staff would already know me, should a position open up once Im finished my degree.


Plus, being a recess supervisor is pretty easy.  Watch the kids play, make sure they arent beating each other up or doing anything especially unsafe, make sure they dont wander away unsupervised.  Occasionally get asked to be a judge or referee for a pickup game of kickball.  Rarely get invited to join in.  Its only for a couple of hours a day, too, so I have plenty of time to get my schoolwork done.


So, anyway last month I noticed two new little boys in the school yard.  One was about eleven or twelve, and the other was maybe five or six.  Both had the same sandy blonde hair and blue eyes.  I could only imagine that they were related; most likely brothers.  The older boy was being tailed by the younger boy.  I noticed that they were loners, not really playing with the other kids, but I didnt think that was too strange because they were new here.  The older boy read a paperback book during recess, while his little brother mostly skipped around him and played in the dirt.  Older Brother didnt acknowledge Little Brother, but again, I know how that goes, being the youngest of three.


For the next week, this same thing repeated until it seemed Older Brother made a few friends and would join in a football game.  Younger Brother still hung by his brothers side.  The older kids all ignored him and I thought that was sad.  I even saw a couple of times when Younger Brother was wide open for a pass, but Older Brother didnt throw him the football.  He didnt even glance his way.  When this continued daily it sort of broke my heart, even though Younger Brother didnt seem bothered by it.  He always capered happily around Older Brother.


Yesterday, Older Brother got tackled a little too hard during their football game.  I ran over and saw that his arm was bent at a weird angle, so I called an ambulance.  As we waited I tried to make him comfortable.  I pointed to a boy in red and told him to get the school nurse, and I pointed to a boy in blue and told him to let Mrs. Reynolds, the schools secretary, know what had happened, so she could call this boys parents.  The rest of the kids pressed close and I waved them back.  Little Brother was sitting right next to Older Brother.  I smiled at him and said that everything was going to be okay.  Little Brother looked at me with huge eyes.  Older Brother scrunched his face up in pain.  I talked to Older Brother, who told me his name was Tommy, trying to distract him from the hurting until help came.


By the time the ambulance came, the rest of the kids were back in class but Little Brother still lingered.  I didnt mind him staying by his brother, and I guessed that his teacher would know his brother was hurt and thats why hed be missing from class.  Once the ambulance took Tommy away, I stood to the side with Younger Brother for a few minutes until their mother arrived looking very tired and frazzled.


I told her not to worry.  I told her the hospital where Tommy was being taken.  I pointed to Younger Brother sitting on the curb.  Your other son is right there.  I tried to talk to him, but he just wouldnt answer me.  He just wanted to hug that football.  He might be in shock, but I told him his brother was going to be just fine.


The mother looked at me like I was crazy.  What are you talking about?  Is this a joke?  Itsits not funny.  Tears formed in her eyes.  Tommys little brother died a month ago.  W-we moved to get away from the bad luck.  Her voice trailed off as she turned and headed to her car in a fog.


I stared after her open-mouthed.  When I turned around to look at Little Brother, he was nowhere to be found, but I could see the football hed been holding lying on the curb where he had been.  Confused and worried that Little Brother had run off, I checked into this with Mrs. Reynolds.  Tommy did not have a little brother or any siblings enrolled in school with him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly, I'm so sorry that you're dealing with this.  Your husband seems like a real dink :(

I agree with /u/poidipoidi though, and I speak from experience.  You need to let your husband take care of the kids, even if it's not the way you want him to do it.  Like, mine would bathe BabySpawn if I asked, but he doesn't do it like I do and it would make me nervous.  I sat myself down and I thought, well, sure it's not the same as I do it, but at least he's DOING it.  I need to be happy that he's participating in his own way.  He's not doing anything *really* wrong or bad, just not my way and I have to realize that's okay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would prefer the stories have more "book-like" titles sometimes.  B/c I totally don't understand why some of the titles I've seen are not considered click-bait.

I don't need the title to give me a summary of the entire story.  "Omg I Saw a Guy in the Woods and He's Scary and Idk What To Do" - why not "The Guy in the Woods" - kind of want to know more.

Nothing against any authors, but it seems that click-baity titles get more upvotes.  Idk.  Ultimately it doesn't matter to me.  I'm just giving my thoughts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He was my best friend, and I killed him.  If I am to be honest, I must say the truth, even if it hurts.  I must give this confession now, before it is too late.  Only the gods know when it will be too late.

Dolan was a blonde haired, blue eyed farm boy.  Me, I am a brunette half-angel.  Back then my wings were pure white.  We met each other by the blessing of the Sun God.  We were both training to be Paladins of the Light.  We, along with several others, heard the call and decided to dedicate our lives and Souls to Him above all other gods.  Paladins are special warriors that are adept at weaponry, but are also able to call down our chosen gods powers to assist us in small ways.

We made our way through our training with little problem.  We helped each other learn our spells, and I helped Dolan master some more complex swordplay.  When we were to graduate and adventure on our own, it was only natural that we decided to travel together and spread the word of the Sun God to all who would listen.

And so it was, for several years.  In my eyes, we were just two best friends.  Nothing more.  I never saw that Dolan wanted more than this.  I never had a clue.  I guess I did not know him as well as I thought I did.

Then came that fateful week.  We arrived just after dark to a small village in the middle of a forest.  It was not marked on our maps, but that was not unusual for us.  Oftentimes little villages would spring up out of nowhere.  We were welcomed by the villagers with open arms, but one villager in particular caught my attention.  When the villager and I made eye contact, I could feel an unfamiliar yet not unpleasant tingling all over my body.  I blushed faintly.  From the moment I saw him, I knew hed be something special to me.  

He had blonde hair so light it was almost white, pale skin, the small and pointed ears of his Elven race, and hypnotic green eyes.  The first night he kept his distance, standing in the back of the crowd as we spoke about who we were and why we were there  to spread the teachings of the Sun God.  Though I tried to look at everyone in the crowd in turn, my eye was constantly drawn back to that man.  When we were done our introductions and headed toward the villages only inn for the night, Dolan was looking at me strangely.  I had no idea what could possibly be wrong, so I imagined he was just tired from our travels.

The next week went by pretty uneventfully.  Other than my blossoming friendship with Lucius, that is.  He would always meet up with Dolan and I in the evening.  Dolan would make some choked excuse and head off most times, but I happily stayed and talked to Lucius.  He told me all about his life, and how he came to be in this village.  Finally on Friday he confessed his feelings to me.  I was ecstatic!  I ran to tell Dolan that I thought it would be a good idea to invite Lucius to travel with us.  After all, Lucius had been extremely interested in us and our Sun God.  Lucius had even said that he was considering becoming a paladin as well!  I could be his sponsor!

Unfortunately, Dolan did not take the news so well.   He cried and screamed and begged, saying that he loved me, that I should be with him, and not to trust Lucius.  Dolan insisted that Lucius was hiding something.  I began to get angry as well.  I had told Dolan before that we were and would always be just friends.  That we could be nothing more.  I left the inn room after that and lingered downstairs in the common area for a while.  I never saw Dolan leave the room.

Sighing, I decided to head toward the clearing in the woods that we had come across before we entered the village with the idle thought of hoping that Lucius would show up.  That was probably foolish, because it was well past midnight, but sleep was going to be evading me for a while.  Maybe I would just sleep in the clearing itself

I knew something was wrong the moment the small clearing came into view.  The moonlight streaming down and filtering through the maple tree leaves seemed innocent enough, but I noticed that there were no sounds.  No scuttle of animal feet as they foraged for food.  No sweet music of crickets chirping.  Nothing.  The air itself seemed to hold its breath, as if waiting for me.  Instinctively, my hand fell to my sword as I walked forward, fully on the defensive.

Slowly, I edged up to the clearing, but didnt quite enter it.  Crouching behind a rose bush, the scent filling my nostrils with a heady feeling, I saw Dolan standing over Lucius, Dolans sword drawn and dripping with Luciuss blood.  Gasping softly, I hesitated for only a moment as anger washed over me.  Before I could react, Dolan drew breath to speak.

You lied to her, and I will expose you for the villain that I know you to be, Lucius!  You may have blinded her, but not so with me!  I will show her the truth, and your terrible plotting will be revealed!  Dolan shouted.  Then muttering to himself, he said, And she will love me for it.

Chuckling softly, Lucius drew a deep breath, and a new light lit his eyes.  You are more of a fool than she is, you know.  You have no idea, absolutely no idea, what you are dealing with, do you, boy?
	
Dolan clenched his sword tighter and moved toward Lucius.  In a flash, I was on my feet and running toward my friends, pulling my sword out of its sheath as I neared the two.  Expertly, I parried Dolans downward slash and stood guard in front of Luciuss fallen form.  Behind me, Luciuss eyes glittered.  What in the Nine Hells are you doing, Dolan?  How could you go so far as to openly attack Lucius?  Are you so blinded by your own feelings that youd sink so low?  My voice was all steel.

Dolan stared into my face with disbelief.  Still, you doubt me?  You would protect thisthing, this abomination!  Why should I ever lie to you, Crystal?  I only want to keep you safe!  You know this is true.  You know how I feel  you know I love you!

Watching the moonlight fall on Dolans hair and face, something inside my stomach tightened and I faltered for a moment. Dolan, I began, my tone soft.  I  Behind me Lucius coughed feebly, and I snapped back to reality.

Lucius was going to die, unless I defended him.  The elf I loved was going to die, because of another mans jealousy.  No, Dolan.  Love is not this way.  You have it all wrong.  But I respected you, once, and because of that, I will give you one chance to walk away.  Just go.  Do not look back, and do not ever try to come into my life again.  I have made my choice, and I am happy.  If you cannot be happy for me, then it is time we went our separate ways.  I brought my sword to bear in front of me.  I have always been the better fighter, Dolan.  Please dont make me force you to go.  Please, just go for me.

Tears started streaming down Dolans face, and seeing them made me begin to cry as well, but my grip on my sword did not waver.  Eyes on the blade, Dolan took a step forward and extended his hand.  Crystal, take my hand, and we can go together.  Leave him, you dont need him.  Hes a *vampire*, the very personification of that which we strive to destroy.  Come back to me, and come back to the Sun God.  He took another step forward and gripped his sword tighter.  Lets take care of this together.

Tensing, I swore under my breath and took my own step forward, but what happened next is forever unclear in my mind.  The next thing I knew, my sword was plunging downward into Dolans chest.  Everything seemed to slow down in that instant.  Dolan was falling.  My hands slid from my sword and moved to catch him as he fell to the ground.  Dimly, I heard laughter  was that Lucius?  did he trip me?  no, of course not, thats just being silly.

Numbly, I fell to the ground beside Dolan, his warm blood colouring the ground, my hands, everywhere, it seemed.  Slowly, Dolan turned his head to me, and his fingertips brushed my face, leaving a small bloody trail in their wake.  Y-youare so stubborn.  Im s-sorry I couldnt keep you safe this time.  Im sorry I failed, Im sorry I love His hands fell from my face and his head fell back, vacant eyes staring at the uncaring moon.  Anguish unlike any I had ever known ripped through every pore in my body, every fiber of my being.  Even my wings felt too heavy to carry me away.  I nearly blacked out from the rending pain that coursed through my body.  Time passed weirdly, and I felt a cold hand on my shoulder.  My confused mind groped for an explanation.  Ah, Lucius.  My love, come to comfort me, to tell me it was not my fault, that everything was going to be okay.

It never gets old, you know.  It always gives me a new thrill to see it.  But I think this time was my favourite.  The hand moved to my face and wiped away Dolans blood from my cheek.  It was Luciuss hand, I noted.  Turning slightly, shifting Dolan to the ground, I stared.  Lucius licked the blood from his fingertips like a spoiled cat.  Well of course he was totally right, dear.  You really should listen to your friends more carefully.  And hey, I dont want you to think were not still friends.  Im pretty much all youve got in this world now, because I dont think your precious Sun God will want the likes of you back after a murder-

Accident.  My interrupting voice was level.  It was an accident.

Oh no, I saw it with my own two eyes in vivid, delicious colour.  You slaughtered him.  You took one step and drove your sword right on through him without even hesitating.  Definitely not an accident, my dear.  Lucius laughed cruelly.

My patriarch will hear me out, he will understand!  He will help me through this, he will!

Oh, I highly doubt hed want to see you right now, looking the way you do.  But I must say, those black wings are so much better than the way the used to be.  White was never really your colour, girl.

My wings?  I turned my head slightly and moved my left wing into my vision.  The tip of it was black, and it seemed that the stain was spreading upward at each passing moment.  I sobbed.

Well, now, dont think youre all alone in this.  I have plans for you, and so does someone else Id like you to meet.  Now, dont be all worried about this, Im pretty sure that you and my boss here will be the best of friends.  Lucius stared me dead in the eyes.  In fact, Id bet my eternal life on it.

Whimpering softly, I stared at the blood on my hands.  Lucius pulled a cloth from his back pocket and wrapped it around his hand.  Placing a foot on Dolans chest for leverage, he pulled out my sword and dropped it, steaming, onto the grass beside me.  Ill just take care of this for you, help you out here, okay?

Slowly I nodded, still unable to comprehend all that had happened.  Where did I have to turn?  Where else could I go?  Lucius was right  my Patriarch would be horrified at what had happened.  Even if it was an accident, clear as day, he wouldnt want to hear it, wouldnt want to listen.  No, there was no place for me in town any longer.  Better to go with Lucius, meet this boss of his.  Who knew what kind of Demon or Devil would be a vampires boss, butPerhaps he would take care of me.  Hide from the Sun.  The dark was safer.

It wasnt until years later that I realized how foolish and childish that hope was.  I killed my best friend, and lost my innocence all in one breathless minute.

/u/kneeod sent me here; I'm excited to get everyone's feedback.  Basically looking for critiques to this writing in general, and if this story is considered "horror" enough for NoSleep and similar forums.  If not, what can I do to make it more horror?  Trying to go for a psychological angle of horror here; this woman believed she was pure and good but lost it all.  Tyvm! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a story that I want to post to NoSleep, but I'm not sure if applies.  It's high fantasy, but I think it could be horror as well.  Basically it's about a woman who accidentally kills her best friend, betraying everything she stands for in her life.

If this isn't "horror" (I was thinking it may be for the psychological element of the story...and not to mention the antagonist is secretly a vampire), what other subreddits could I post this to?  I tried the search bar, but I've found that my fav boards come from others' recommendations.

Thanks =) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted a link to a dress w/ doggies on it for the dog exchange.  I said that it was very expensive (it's like $75.00) but it was just an idea of something that I'd wear, if my Santa was lost.  I said that I didn't expect him to buy it for me, but it's an example of how quirky I am fashion-wise :P

Is there anything similar to what your Ron match asked for?  If your match asked for Season 1 of Parks   Rec, can you maybe instead send a comic book or book?  (If such a thing exists, idk, I didn't sign up for that one b/c I was pretty clueless on who it even was ._.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I post that quite frequently, and I'm glad to explain why.  It's specifically directed to my brother   SIL.  Constantly they (well, tbh, it's *her* 99% of the time) want to hang out/double date/spend time together.  Me   my husband's work schedules NEVER change.  SIL's doesn't change.  My brother's rotates.  I told them to pick a date *any* date they want.  THIS after literally 2 years of "trying to hang out" even once.  I understand that yes, sometimes things come up.  Things happen.  But when, 100% of the time we have **SET PLANS** to do something, and YOU bail, then welll, like I said - You make time for those that you really want to make time for.  I'd rather her just say she doesn't have time or that she doesn't want to (I suspect it's this) rather than constantly bitching out on me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can only tell you what we did, and what worked for us.  We did a modified CIO.  At 8pm, I give BabySpawn a bath, wash him and let him play a little.  I'd dress him in PJs and give him a bottle with the lights all out in his room, just the hallway light on so I could see.  After that, he'd be in that "drowsy but awake" mode.  I'd sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to him while I burped him, kissed him, then laid him in his crib, turned on a white noise machine, and said goodnight.  The first couple nights we waited 5 min before going in and reassuring him, patting his back, etc but not picking him back up.  Then we waited 10 minutes for a couple nights, repeat.  Then we waited 15 minutes.  That was only one night, b/c after about 2 weeks, he didn't even make it until 15 min, he'd fall asleep and mostly sleep through the night (except a week or two when he only wanted a nighttime bottle, which we'd just give him and he'd fall asleep very quickly after this.  I guess maybe it was during growth spurts, but now that he's getting table food, he grew out of it on his own.)

Now, at almost 15 months he doesn't get the right-before-bed-bottle anymore.  So when I put him down he kind of lays there talking to himself or playing with his stuffed animals and falls asleep on his own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes.  He eats what we eat for dinner.  Luckily he hasn't refused anything, but I can definitely see what his favourites are.  I will not cook a completely separate meal for BabySpawn.  But, for example, if down the line he doesn't like breaded chicken, but the rest of us do, I will make a couple pieces plain for him and breaded for the rest of us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand.  Before and during pregnancy I said I wanted 3 kids.  I guess I didn't realize how hard having a baby actually is.  BabySpawn is a pretty awesome, laid back baby, but he still needed things at all hours of the night/day in the beginning and oh gods I was not prepared for the amount of no sleep I'd be getting.  I even had a very decent support system, but, I'd lament, where were they at 3am?  Minutes and hours and days dragged on.  I dreamed about running away and disappearing.  (I wish to gods I'd known about Reddit back then; might have saved myself some tears, I think, b/c even though I wanted to talk about these feelings, I just couldn't form the words.)  I was a definite "no" to having more kids then.

But now, over a year later, we've gotten into a "groove" of sorts and I know things will still be harder at times, I feel like I could entertain the thought of having possibly one other Spawn-Kid.  I also know how I felt after BabySpawn, so I will be able to talk to my doctors and let them know about it before it gets "too hard" to talk to people.

My point is that, you might think you want one now, and that thought may not change.  That's fine.  But, in time, you might also rethink it.  That's also fine.  Whatever choice you make, it will be what's best for you :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our area was hit with a snowstorm.  (As I'm sure you may have heard.)  It started as snow, but changed to ice, so everything has a good coating.  So, the neighbour's tree branch snapped and fell on our deck.  Husband starts ranting about how he should have just cut all the branches hanging over our property down (though the offending branch wasn't over our property; it's just how it snapped and the wind blew), how the house is "endangered" and how he's SO MAD ABOUT THE DAMAGE.  (Thankfully there's none.  Maybe a scratch or two on the deck that we almost never use.  Oh, no! /s)  Also the neighbour came over and apologized, offered to help us move the branches off our deck if we needed it, etc.  Literally not a big deal.

Then, he decides he wants to drive me to work b/c it's so icy, which I do appreciate b/c even though the streets are mostly clear, I haven't had my license for very long and I am a bit uncomfortable.

SO THIS MEANS NOW that he has to clean off both cars and shovel the whole walkway and driveway.  For some reason.  So that makes me even later.  And apparently my trying to help is just getting in the way.  Welp, I will 100% never offer to help you again, even if you were dying.  Okay...In the meantime, a small branch falls from one of our trees onto our roof.  WELL NOW SHIT - it's all my fault b/c I didn't want to cut the tree down and now the roof is "destroyed" and "leaking" - I very highly doubt this is the case, b/c last summer we cut down all the big branches.  e_e  BUT IT'S MY FAULT FOR WANTING TO KEEP THE TREE THERE B/C I DIDN'T WANT SPEND ANOTHER $800.00 on a perfectly healthy tree! YES!

Proceeds to drive me (  BabySpawn, lest we forget) to work, cursing the whole way.  Demanding to know how I will remove the branch from the roof, b/c since this is MY FAULT I will be the one to take care of it.  (Okay, I'm not scared,  I will climb up there tonight if it's SO important.)  Meanwhile he's driving and not cleaning off the windshield, tailgating, trying to do 50 - um, the roads are clear but they are very slippy and wet and other drivers are going slow.  We almost rear-ended a truck and there was NO reason for it.

But yeah, I'm endangering BabySpawn but not cutting down that tree.  You know, not the person literally freaking out for almost no reason and driving like a douche bag.  And tonight I'm quite sure he's going to ask for a blow job.  Nah, bro.  I'm mad enough to bite. </TEXT>

<TEXT> BabySpawn is still a bit of a ways off for this, but I imagine that I will help him, as my parents helped me in my time.  If my kid wants some ideas on how to get started, we could brainstorm together.  If he wants help with the layouts of the poster board, I will show him how to plan it out on a bit of scrap, then have him go on the final product.  He will type his own paper, but I will proofread it, then show him where he needs to correct it, and why it isn't correct grammatically.  I don't want to leave him completely on his own, especially when he's young, but I don't want to do the whole thing for him, either.  I also image the older he gets, the less he will need/want my help, and that's okay, too. </TEXT>

I was in a guild once where, long story short this hunter was always on, talked about how he was excited to be going on the first date w/ this girl he really liked.  Logged off that night and was gone for 2 weeks.  We laughed and said they ran away together.  Turns out he actually got into a severe car accident and almost died :/  We didn't kick him.  He was our hero after that.

I'm glad you dodged a bullet here, though!  I hope you found a nicer guild, too. </TEXT>

That's so not fair.  You also deserve you time.  This is prob my #1 pet peeve omgggg but I'm just going to leave it at that.

I think it's great that you have a plan for this weekend.  Hopefully he will be receptive and open to listening to you.  As far as meal prep/diet - personally I hate it, but it is so helpful in losing weight that I suffer for an hour every Sunday to get lunches ready for me and my husband lol.

I lost 30 lbs in about 4.5 months through diet alone.  (I don't have time to go to the gym currently, though with BabySpawn now getting older, I'm going to see about fitting it into my schedule.)  If you're interested in hearing what I did, please send me a message.  If not, that's okay too.  I am sending you good vibes and support hugs.  You got this, mama :D :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1.)  Accept the fact that after you have the baby, holding your pee will be next to impossible.  You can work on this, but it's still going to happen.

2.)  You can (and should) making noises around your sleeping baby.  I was afraid I'd breathe too loudly and wake him up.  That never happened xD  I was afraid to turn the TV up when BabySpawn was upstairs sleeping.  Behind a closed door.  You can turn the TV up w/in hearing range.  You won't wake your baby up :P

3.)  Get out and walk around when you are able.  Helped me feel better, helped shake off some depression.

4.)  Don't feel guilty about leaving your baby.  You *NEED* time away.  It will make you a better person, I promise you this.  Try to keep up with 1 or 2 hobbies that you enjoy.  It will help you keep your sanity.

5.)  Your whole view on life will shift in a way that I can't explain.  You will know what I mean one day out of the blue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was a real person, and I understood now that they had always been real people behind their monitors somewhere in the world.

OP, this line gave me chills.  I am an avid online gamer.  I have borne witness to the cruel trolling, teasing, and tormenting of people many times.  It's heartbreaking, b/c people *forget* that it's a real person, with real feelings.  You were able to see something bigger than you in the end.

It starts out small.  A little taunt to a stranger (the kick), it gets a little more specific (the punch), it literally rips you apart (the stab), then it hits home in the worse way (the father), and just when you are about to go someplace that you can never return from (your death), you see the error of your ways.  I teared up a little.  There is a fantastic lesson to be learned here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I keep puking, and thanks to this being my second pregnancy, every time I puke I also piss my pants.

Oh, the things nobody tells you but you wish they did.  Yeah that was a shock for me, too - whenever I sneeze I pee.

Hope you feel better mama!!  And congrats, too. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My guild has been downing this boss for a couple of weeks now, but for this boss in particular I'm getting carried hard.  My ilvl is 896, and I'm an Enhance Shaman.

My issue seems to be that I'm having a hard time seeing the adds and boss with all the orbs, floor puddles, and domes so I can't target what I need to when I need to.  Even if I'm targeting the correct mob, I'm having a hard time seeing if I'm actually *facing* the mob to be dps'ing it.  This is literally the only boss I'm having an issue with seeing.

As a result I'm lucky if I make 280k dps with food and flask buffs.  It's horrifying.  Does anyone have this problem, or suggestions to help? </TEXT>

<TEXT> By the end of my pregnancy I was over 200 lbs at 5'4" so, I can relate to you that way.  Four months later I started to diet (and only diet b/c while I loved the gym, I currently don't have time to go) and I lost 30 lbs in about 4.5 months.  I managed to keep that weight off for a year, and now I'm back to it again so I can get the last 30 off me.  Literally all I did was change my eating habits.  I meal prep my lunches on Sunday afternoons.  (Since your daughter is 8, maybe she can help you do it!!)  If you (or anyone else) wants to know more, plz feel free to send me a PM, or leave a comment.

Also if you figure out that "think yourself thin" thing can you plz let me know, b/c I like chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream more than I like salads.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read that article that /u/gileshasatv linked.  It says that your doctor can possibly help you w/ a physical therapist, and yes, a "tummy tuck" may fix it.  Like I said, maybe there's a way your doctor can write it up so it's medically necessary to have done.  You'd probably have to go through the therapy first.

IMO, if you're serious about wanting to do something to feel better in your own skin (  you def owe it to yourself to feel this way!!) you should start with talking to your doctor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every day, my husband makes a comment about BabySpawn's hair.  Says he looks like a hippy, that it's too long, that he looks like a girl (he doesn't; not one stranger has once called him a girl), it's getting in his eyes (it's not, I style it to the side and it mostly stays there), etc - the list goes on and on.  In fact, most random people come up and compliment his hair and say how beautiful it is!!  Yes, it's thick, and there's a lot but it's managed.  I don't want to cut it.  I love how it's curling at the edges.  Just...stahhhhhp.  It's going to break my heart to cut it T____T </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suppose it's possible, but I'm not a doctor.  Did you have a C-section?  I believe that can cause your tummy to look "off" but if you do exercises it can help bring it back to normal.  Is it possible to talk to your doctor about your skin and stomach?  I'm not sure, maybe there's a way it can be written up to be medically necessary to have it removed?  Not sure about your breasts, though....don't think they cover that unfortunately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As others have said, you can purchase a Battlechest for about $20.00 and that includes everything from WoW Vanilla up to WoD, and you will be able to level 1-100.  Legion will cost you about an additional $40.00.  This will get you from 100-110.  You don't need to buy Legion right away, if this will help you save money or space out the costs.  I think the Battlechest comes with a free boost to 90, and buying Legion comes with another boost to 100.  Yes, the game is worth playing.  It's fun :)

When you join up, make sure you check out /r/wownoob b/c hey, we all start somewhere! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is often a frequent lucid dream of mine, and it's a signal to me that it's a dream.  For example, I will be in my parents' kitchen, but the colours and dcor is off.  At this point I start looking all around the house, outside, at what was my old room to look at the clothes, I even look in the mirror to see myself.  Some of the alternate worlds are quite sad (my brother died at age 18 in one, for example) but some of them are interesting (my house was literally on the beach and I could see the ocean from my window.)

I've heard some people think you can travel to parallel universes in dreams, so who knows?  That's why once I realize what I'm doing, I try to explore and look around and see what's different. </TEXT>

Zipping up my coat and unfurling my umbrella as I headed out the front door, I breathed a sigh of relief.  I just got off work for the day, and it was a tough one.  Being an EMT can be extremely rewarding and extremely draining.  Most of the time Im lucky enough to get to where I need to be in time and save the day, so to speak, but of course other times Im not so fortunate.  Those are the hard days.  Today was one of those days.

My last call of the day was to a car accident involving a blue SUV and a black sports car.  The cars driver left the scene pretty banged up, but at least he was alive.  The woman in the SUV was not so lucky.  I remembered glancing at the forlorn carseat buckled in the backseat of her vehicle.  At least she didnt have the kid with her.  Idont like to think about that.  Those are the days that I open up the hard liquor.

My thoughts turned toward my own mother then.  Shes been gone now maybe 10 years.  A long time.  But I still miss her.  She died in my arms.  She was sick, so it wasnt unexpected, but I was little more than a teenager at the time.  I needed her then.  Days like these, I needed her now.

I made my way to my car, folded my umbrella down, and tossed it inside.  I got in and started the car up, turning the heat up to full blast.  I fished my new cell phone out of the glove box.  I kept it there so I didnt worry about it during my shifts.  After all, there was nobody who would really be calling me.  I lived alone, and I wasnt dating anyone.  So I was quite surprised to see that I had 2 missed calls and 1 voicemail.

I didnt bother to check the call logs.  I dialed right to the voicemail.  I hoped it was someone getting in touch with me about another job Id applied for a couple days ago.  I checked my mirrors and prepared to drive home when the voicemail finally went through.  My blood ran cold when I heard the voice.

Hi, Daisy.  I was thinking about you today.  Wondering how youve been so I thought Id call and check up on you.  I just wanted to say Im proud of you.  I dont know if Ive said that enough.  Ill call again, chirped my dead mothers voice.

I stopped in my tracks and tore the phone from my ear.  I pressed replay, wondering if Id have heard wrong.  No, that was definitely my moms voice.  I would know it anywhere.  I had longed to hear that sound more than any otherand yet now that my secret wish had come true, I was wishing Id never asked for this.

I checked the missed call log and saw that somehow the call had come from my moms cell phone number.  I stared at the entry: Missed call from Mom Cell :) Yes, my dead mothers cell phone number was still stored in my contacts.  I couldnt bring myself to delete it.  Hell, I couldnt bring myself to cancel her number.  I still paid the bill every month.  I kept her old phone in a drawer in my bedroom under my socks.  Funny how we hang onto the weirdest things, isnt it?

I decided to shrug it off.  Today had been awful enough.  It must have been some glitch; it must have been a voicemail that got lost in cyberspace or wherever cell phone voicemails come from and it had only now been delivered.  I didnt receive any more strange phone calls, and I put it out of my mind for a while.

*****
A few weeks later, things were going better.  I had actually met someone!  We had gone on 2 dates so far and we were getting along well.  Obviously too soon to tell, but I really felt good about this one.  And my partner and I were being recognized at work next month for our exemplary actions and response time.  I was especially proud of that because Id been trying for a promotion, and this would be a great example of how dedicated I am.  It was the kind of day I wish I could share with my mother.

Once again after work I pulled my cell phone from my glove box.  (Old habits die hard.)  And I saw 2 missed calls, 1 voicemail.  I assumed it was Greg calling to confirm our dinner plans for that night, so I glanced at the call log.  Imagine my surprise when I saw Moms Cell :) in the call log.  Twice!  Shaking, I dialed the voicemail.

Hi, Daisy!  I just wanted to tell you how proud I am of you!  Getting recognized at work.  Meeting that new boy.  I really like him.  He reminds me of your father.  I know you two will have a fine future together.  Ill call again, she sang, cheerful as ever.  As if she wasnt dead and buried in the ground and incapable of making this phone call.

I threw the phone down on the passenger side seat and decided to do a sanity check.  I drove home.  Though my drive was short, it gave me plenty of time to curse myself for falling victim to a possible scam.  P-Mobile seemed too good to be true.  All this unlimited data for so inexpensive.  I rolled me eyes.  Did I really think my dead mother was making calls from beyond the grave?

I got out of the car, stuffing my cell phone into my back pocket.  I let myself in and marched myself right up to my bedroom.  I pulled open my top drawer and searched under my socks for my moms old cell phone.  The familiar weight of her Nokia in my hand, I breathed a sigh of relief.  I studied it, saw that it was completely dead and uncharged and incapable of making any phone calls.  I was about to chalk it up to another extremely weird glitch when suddenly my cell phone started to vibrate.

I reached into my back pocket and checked the display screen.  Moms Cell :) was clearly displayed.  I glanced at her old, dead, uncharged cell phone in my other hand.  My finger hovered over the Accept Call Button.  I held my breath.  I had to know.  I hit accept.

*****

UPDATE.  Now that I've had some time to collect my thoughts, I just want to briefly mention what happened.  It was my mom, alright.  Sounded just the same as she did my entire life.  Asked the same "mom" questions.  Whenever I tried to ask how this was possible, she laughed and said that phones have existed forever, this isn't new technology.  When I asked her where she was, the call would kind of, I don't know....fuzz out.  When I asked her rather awkwardly if she remembered being sick, she paused and responded that yes, she remembered but she got better and moved away to a milder climate to help alleviate some lingering pain.  It was just...surreal.  We're supposed to talk again in a day or so.  I don't why; I can't explain it.  But my mom is somehow back... </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, this happened a long time ago.  I must have been at least 18, no older than 20.  (Am now 33; Reddit didn't exist back then, but now I am discovering so many awesome boards where I can post about things!!)

I was sleeping on my back in my bed in my parents' house where I lived, when I suddenly woke up from a deep, dreamless sleep.  I opened my eyes and a male, humanoid shadow seemed like it pushed itself up from *laying on top of me.*  It seemed surprised that I woke up, interrupting whatever it was doing.  It wasn't anything sexual; if anything it was, not sure how to describe it...like, "feeding" or "scanning me" I guess makes the most sense and I know both of those are sort of at odds with each other.  It swooped back at me in a rush and I fell back asleep instantly.  I woke up about 2 hours later than my normal wake-up time and I felt okay, just a little sluggish.  I never saw it again.

Um, what? </TEXT>

<TEXT> 6am comes and my Spawn wakes up crying b/c he's peed through his diaper.  My husband actually gets up to check on him and comes back to bed, telling me Spawn is soaked through.  Okay, did you change him?  Oh...no.  I really need another 30, can you deal with it?  (Am slightly annoyed, but I honestly don't mind b/c he has a much longer commute that I do.)  But I do need his help to hold Spawn while I change his soaked through bed sheets.  "Why don't you just put him back to sleep on the dry end?"  Okay, that made me mad, but I figured at 6am we're not fighting; I will address it later.

Back to sleep for another hour or so.  When.  "I don't have any clean socks."  Yes, you do.  They are in the bottom of the laundry basket.  I haven't had time to fold all of the laundry, so there are neat stacks of clothes on top.  Just take the stacks off and get your underwear/socks.  Apparently that's too hard to do, so he starts cursing.  And throwing the stacks on the bed, right on top of me so I have to wake up.  He knocks one of the stacks over which breaks the closet door.  At this point I'm struggling not to laugh in his face as he's throwing a temper tantrum.

He starts screaming that he has no clean shirts (he does; I had no idea the 5 or so remaining are too small for his fat ass) and why didn't I get them from the tailors?  (Uh well I didn't have extra money b/c your fucking asshole self hasn't paid any of my credit card THAT I BOUGHT YOUR ENTIRE FUCKING FAMILY'S CHRISTMAS GIFTS WITH) so there's that.

Now doors are slammed and he's purposely pounding up and down the stairs almost like he *wants* to wake up Spawn at this point.  I'm just kind of staring at him b/c if I say one word I will literally start laughing at him even though I'm furious.

Snatches his jacket up off the hook, slams out the door w/o saying goodbye.  Tears out of the driveway.  (I hope he crashes.)

I am cruising a hot wave of hate right now, and I honestly don't care if he sees this b/c I am just so fucking angry/annoyed and I can never put it into words, never DISCUSS it b/c he throws a tantrum like he's fucking 3.  Please give me reasons not to plot his murder.  x_X

UPDATE:  He called and apologized profusely...Said he wasn't really mad at me, just w/ some stuff he'd been thinking about with work, etc.  Still reserving the right to murder at a later date ;) </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Cell Phone Service Is Fantastic </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-14 23:27:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My cell phone was not really holding a charge anymore, and my wifes camera took grainy photos.  We both seemed to have a lot of dropped calls for some reason, too.  I wanted to surprise my wife with a new phone with an amazing camera so she could take better pictures of our new infant daughter to post on FaceBook.

I researched several phones online, as well as several cell phone carriers, but unfortunately, I couldnt find anything we could afford.  I sighed, because I knew this phone would be everything to my wife, and honestly I needed it as well because I relied on my phone for work.  Im proud to say that I drive full time for Uber, and part time for Lyft.  It pays the bills, but there just isnt enough for any upgrades right now, especially with my wife out on maternity leave.  I let the thought of new phones fade into the background of my mind for a while.

A few weeks later, or maybe a few days(its really hard to tell, sleep deprivation will do that to you and you quickly learn all about that when you have a newborn) I happened to be awake at 3AM surfing the Internet.  It was my turn to take care of our daughter so that my wife could get a little bit of sleep herself.  I must have been dozing at my computer chair, because Im not sure how I managed to bump my speaker volume up to full.  I was startled awake suddenly to the sound of an excited ad  NEW CELL PHONES, GREAT PRICES!!  NEW SERVICE NOW IN YOUR AREA!

I looked blurrily at my computer screen as I fumbled to turn the volume down to a less-baby-waking level.  I glanced at my daughter, magically somehow still asleep in her Rock n Play, then back to the wildly flashing ad.  Thoughts of new phones for me and my wife bubbled to the surface, so I clicked on the ad and was brought to a pretty basic yet modern looking website for a cell phone company called P-Mobile.  I smirked a little, but I clicked around a little bit.

Turns out I would not only be able to afford two new Androids, but also a better data plan.  I almost thought this was too good to be true.  I may have been sleep deprived but I wasnt a complete fool.  I noted the physical address of a shop the next town over, and I decided Id drive over the next day and check it out for myself.

The next day I happened to pick up a quick fair that took me close to the new P-Mobile store, so after I dropped him off I headed there.  The front of the building was again simple, professional, and modern.  Inside was more of the same, and the salesperson helped me so efficiently, was so friendly and informed, that before I knew what had happened, hed switched me over to the new carrier and I was heading out the door with two brand new Androids.  He even promised wed never have any problems with dead zones again.  Well, my wife was definitely going to freak out when she heard this.

I surprised her the moment I came in the door and she was beyond happy.  She started taking pictures of our daughter immediately.  I was glad I could bring a smile to her face.

I sat down and started looking through the app store, downloading what Id need for work.  As I scrolled, I saw one Id never heard of before  [Life Is Beta](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5pmu3w/my_strange_experiences_with_an_app_called_life_is/)  but it didnt sound like something Id be interested, so I just passed it by.  At that moment, our little daughter decided to awaken from her nap with a loud cry that could only mean she needed a new diaper.  I put the phone down and said that Id take care of her.  My wife smiled gratefully.

I took our daughter upstairs and prepared to change her when I discovered we only had one clean diaper left!  I changed her quickly and brought her back downstairs.  Honey, I have to go to the store for a minute to pick up more diapers.  Were all out.

Oh dont worry, Im actually about to head out anyway.  I need to pick up something for dinner, she responded.  I smiled and acquiesced, knowing that she valued time away from the house.  She slipped her coat on and headed out the door.

About 45 minutes later, my wife texted me.  Bad accident on Main Street.  Going to be delayed.  I love you xoxo.  I responded that it was no big deal, but to hurry as it was nearing my time for me to leave and drive for Uber.  I will really try to be home for you, she replied.

Twenty minutes later, she still hadnt turned up so I called our neighbor and asked her to come over and sit with my daughter so that I could leave for work.  When the neighbor arrived, I thanked her and assured her that my wife would be here soon.  I said my goodbyes and switched my Uber app on.

Almost instantly I received a notification for a pickup.  It was close by Main Street, a few roads over.  I drove toward the fair, squinting as I passed the intersection over Main Street and seeing flashing lights in the distance still.  My fair was glad to see me.

Im glad you arrived so quickly!  That accident is pretty bad, I thought I was going to be late to work because nobody could get to me.  Apparently, some jerk in a sports car cut off a woman in an SUV.  They say the woman was killed instantly  My heart leaped into my throat but I didnt really want think about it.  Plenty of people drive SUVs.  My wife drives a blue SUV in fact, but she had been texting me.  She texted me *after* the accident.  No way it was her.  I sighed and drove my fair a few blocks down the road.  As he was leaving, my phone rang.

It was my wife, and I released a breath I hadnt realized Id been holding.  I pulled over to the side of the road and answered my phone.  Hi, babe, are you finally out of that traffic jam? I answered.

Well yes, but it turns out Im going to miss dinner.  Im really sorry.  I should have been more careful, I should have looked both ways but I just wanted to get back to you guys, she sobbed.

Honey, calm down.  We can have dinner when you get home, the time doesnt matter.  Just let me know so I can head home myself.  Our neighbor is with the baby.  My heart started thudding in my chest again.  I felt uneasy.

I cant go home anymore.  I have to stay here now, but its okay, the cell phone service is amazing.  You sound so clear.  I will probably be able to call you often!  My phone beeped; call waiting.  Oh, you probably want to take that call, hon.  Its important.  But dont worry.  Call me back.  She hung up.

Dumbfounded, I answered the phone.  It was the police, telling me what I guess I knew in the bottom of my heart.  My wife was in a fatal car accident today on Main Street. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tried asking this on actual Neo, but as of last night I didn't get any responses...

I got a Neomail from TNT saying I'd correctly guessed the Mystery Pic, along w/ some Neopoints.  I did not get the item, so I would guess I wasn't in the top 250.  But how do I know what's happening with the trophy?  I have one from a previous win a long time ago.  How do I know where I "placed" - like what number correct guess was I?  Will it change colour, or will it say x2 CHAMPION, something else?  Will it change at all?

Thanks guys =) </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Dear Diary,*

*I got a new job.  Me.  Finally.  Its perfect for me.  I work nights, so I can sleep in!  Haha.  Whatever, its empowering, but Im not going to be a hoe about it.  I have some standards*

I sighed and closed my diary.  I sat cross-legged on my twin bed in the near-dark.  The only light was coming from a small pink desk lamp on my second-hand end table.  Well, I may not have much but at least I will be able to pay my rent and afford a small car payment.  And its all anonymous, at least.  

*****

Id had a decent night at work.  I made an extra $500.00 more than my usual haul of $200.00 or so.  All for pretty much just talking.  Sure, he asked for more but I have never done things like that and I never plan to.  He was okay with that.  Most of them are.  I did my private dance for him and we talked a bit.  Every once in a while you get a creep that expects you to do more, but in that case I would just whisper that Id get another girl whod do whatever it is hed wanted.  If he wouldnt take no for an answer, I would press the button for the bouncer to come.  That only happened once when I first started about a year ago, and I didnt know how to look for warning signs.  Ah, ignorance.

The other girls at the Kitty Kat Lounge said I was a fool.  That I should do the little extras to be able to afford a nicer life.  After all it was just me, and what should I care?  I did care, because despite my poor little flat that I lived in and my old Prius, they were mine and I owned them.  I was dreaming of a better life, sure, but I was going to make it my own way and not by being something I wasnt.  My attitude was considered funny, so they teased me.  Candy, the Sweet You Can Never Taste.  It really was just teasing, nothing catty at the Kitty Kat Lounge.  Believe it or not, the 5 of us really stuck together like an extended family or something.

After closing I changed into a plain white t-shirt and jeans.  I pulled on a black hoodie and I headed to my car.  I opened the door and slid inside.  I slipped the key into the ignition and I took a deep breath, trying to decompress.  I looked forward to my 45-minute drive.  Its my way for me to relax and unwind and symbolically leave Candy behind me.  I can transform myself back to Mary.  Just Mary, the good girl.  The one whod never be a stripper.  Well, I almost had enough money in my savings now to go to back to school like Id always wanted to do!  I went over in my mind again the nights events.  Standard, except for the last guy.  It was nice to just talk sometimes.

A few minutes later I pulled out of the parking lot and onto the lonely road home.  I glanced at my cell phone sitting forlornly in the cup holder, 2:30AM.  I glanced up and noticed a car behind me pull out as well.  Strange, because I hadnt noticed another car in the parking lot with me, but that didnt mean anything.  It could have been one of the other girls, but I was not really paying attention as I left.  Id been thinking about the extra money.  I glanced down again and saw my phone light up, but I didnt pay much attention to that.  I generally dont answer the phone this late, anyway.  I figured it was one of the girls from work, but they know I dont answer the phone while driving.

I drove on for about 5 minutes when the car behind me suddenly turned up its high beams.  I sighed.  I really hated it when people did this.  I mean, I drive the speed limit, but I dont speed.  Safety first!  The lights kept on steadily so sped up a bit and they turned off.  I continued on and the car behind me sped up; flicked the high beams on again. 

I tried to look into the rearview mirror, but I could see nothing in the glare of its halogen bulbs.  What the heck was this guys problem?  Now I was doing about 10 mph over the speed limit.  My mind flitted back to the man, the last man in my private booth.  Hed be a little awkward.  Thin greasy hair on top with a bit of dandruff.  Glasses, overweight, smelled like BO.  Id been nothing but my candy-coated self the entire time, and even though I did get a slightly weirdo vibe from him, I didnt press the bouncer button.  

Hed just wanted to talk about his wife a little, about how she made him so mad that he wanted to kill her, just to get away.  He said I was so nice and understanding.  That I reminded him of how his wife was before she became a mean-hearted shrew.  He asked me out to dinner, and he shyly asked me for some other things right there that I said flat out no to, but not unkindly.  He had let it go at that, but did I miss the signs?  Did I miss anger in his eyes?

I sped up even more and fumbled for my cell phone.  The car behind me pressed on, kept the high beams blaring, tailgating me.  I glanced away from the road and dialed 911.  I wasnt dealing with this.  My mind started to race.  I swerved a little as I dialed, but I was able to correct.  I heard my bag of extra clothes hit the door with a dull thud.  When the dispatcher got on the line I burst into tears.

Please help me, Im trying to drive home from work and there is someone behind me, following me!  Im scared, I begged.

The dispatcher was kind and calming.  After telling her about where I was, she gave me quick directions to a parking lot where I should pull into.  She assured me that there would police waiting for me.  I hung up and really laid the pedal to the metal.  I couldnt quell visions of the greasy man attacking me when I pulled into the parking lot.  I cried harder, but I made it the parking lot, mystery car hot on my tail.

It felt like an hour, but it was really only 30 seconds.  Three police cars pulled into the parking lot behind both of our cars, lights blaring.  They swarmed in and at the car behind me.  I cautiously put my car in park and glanced into my left rearview mirror.  I saw them pulling not the greasy man from earlier that night, but Diamond from her car!  Now what the heck was my coworker from the strip club doing following me like that?  I

Movement in the corner of my eye and I twisted around.  It was a good thing I did, because looming up behind me from the backseat of my car was Mr. Greasy himself, wielding a wicked-looking butcher knife.  See, I just wanted to take you out, he whispered, leering at me.  You remind me sooo much of my wife

I screamed and somehow managed to open my drivers side door.  I fell out of it and ran toward the police officers, a hysterical mess.  I was screaming and pointing to my car.  After a moments confusion, they ran over to my car and found Mr. Greasy in between the center console with his wrists slit by his own hand.  I didnt care if he lived or died then I dont care now.

Diamond ran over to me as I bawled on parking lot ground, gravel digging into my palms.  She put her hand on my back.  Honey Im so sorry, I didnt know what to do.  I saw him in your car but you didnt answer your phone and I guess you didnt see him.  I followed you and flicked the high beams on.  Whenever I did that, he ducked back down behind your seat!

Of course I didnt see him, Id be lost in my own little world.  Thank you, Diamond.  I looked up then and noticed that were we in an old church parking lot.  Stressed as I was, I snorted laughter and pointed to the building.  Diamond smiled, too.

I took the hint from the universe.  Enough was enough.  I quit the next day. </TEXT>

"My friends have 2 cats.  When they brought their first baby home, the cats peed all over the floor our of jealousy.  The carpets were never fully cleaned, just some spray put on the spots where the cats peed.  The cats have stopped peeing on the floor now, but the house still really smells like cat pee.  Now, almost 2 years later, their kid is walking around and playing on the floor.  Some of her toys are right where the offending cat-pee-spots are.  So, I thought maybe it would be a nice thing to do....When they go on vacation this spring, I will go into their house and clean their carpets and try to get the smell out as a nice surprise."

<TITLE> The Friendship Lamp </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-25 23:39:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Forgive me, Redditors, for coming here and crying to you, but I need to talk to someone.  Anyone.  Would talk to a pet, if I had one, but Im allergic to most animals so thats not an option.  Im also incredibly shy yet I fear being alone.  Its a little weird, but its me.  At least this way I can be anonymous; that is the wonder of the Internet.  I can be anyone, or I can be no one.  Ok, so the reason why Im here.  I really need to get this out.

My best friend committed suicide this morning.   I didnt see it coming.  I dont think anyone did.  I wonder if this makes me a bad friend.  It literally makes me alternately mad at myself for not noticing and mad at her for leaving me here, all alone once again.  She was probably the only real person in the world that I was friends with and I couldnt help her even though shed helped me so many times in the past.  Its just.so wrong.  It all feels wrong.

Our meeting wasnt anything special.  My parents were in the air force and often stationed all over the world.  Every couple of years or so Id be uprooted.  So there I was a Sophomore in a new high school, and she was assigned to be my student ambassador.  I hated that some schools did this, because usually the ambassador didnt want to really be bothered with me, since I barely spoke.  Anyway, she showed me around for the first week.  She was all blonde hair, green eyes, athletic body, bubbly persona.  Me?  I was all dark hair, dark eyes, slightly chubby, incredible introvert.

I dont really know why, but Shauna took a special interest in me.  She still would walk up to me in the hallway after our week together was up, and ask how I was going.  I barely was able to mumble replies to her as she stood there wearing the latest fashions and expensive perfumes while I, in contrast, stood there in faded black jeans.  I thought that eventually shed get bored and move on but she stuck with it.  It took her a month or so, but eventually she asked me to hang out with her sometime.  I reluctantly agreed.

Shauna came to my house and my parents were floored to see an actual person had come to see me!  An actual friend, a girl my own age.  They knew enough not to ask any strange questions, though, so we headed up to my room.  I had a poster chart of Morse Code on my wall, and a couple Air Force logos, but other than that my room was pretty sparse and maybe a little odd, especially for a teenage girl.  She didnt judge me.  She sat on my bed and talked about everything and nothing.  This became our weekend ritual every Friday night.  For the next three years.

Needless to say Shauna and I became best friends.  She was a closet nerd, and I just felt super comfortable around her.  Though I was truly shy, I could tell her anything, and she would tell me anything, too.  Our senior year was when it got weird, I guess, now that Im thinking of it.

We were about a month away from graduation, and Shauna couldnt stop talking about this boy she met online named Mike.  So cute (he was), so nice (his texts seemed nice) but he lived a couple of states over.  She was planning to meet him after graduation.  I was happy for her.

That month flew by, and I got ready to give Shauna what I thought was the coolest gift ever  Friendship Lamps.  They were these 2 blue matching lamps that looked like stained glass.  The edges and base were black.  When you touched one, the other would light up no matter how far away they were from each other.  I synced them together and had them both set up to show her yesterday.

She came over, I showed her, but we got into an argument about Mike.  Some of his texts seemed a littleoff.  He wanted her to come out to see him, he had something so great to show her.  It was going to be a surprise so he was going to pick her up at the train station.  That was why he wouldnt give her his home address. Ookay.  He couldnt wait to feel her hand in his, to hug her closeI dont know, I cant describe it, it was just a vibe I was getting, okay?  Anyway she left in a rage, and forgot her present.  She left early the next morning.

And later this afternoon, Shaunas mom called and told me the terrible news.  She didnt give many details, only that theyd found her at the train station, and that shed taken her own life.  I let this news sink in and headed upstairs to my bedroom.  I looked at the Friendship Lamps that would never work; that wed never get to play with together.  I thought coming to Reddit to tell my story would help my grieving process, so typed this all up.  I fell asleep staring at the lights.

I woke up around 3:00 AM.  I saw one of the Friendship Lamps was lit on my computer desk.  I thought that strange, because its twin was sitting right next to it, dark.  I walked over to them both, when the lit lamp began blinking in a seemingly erratic pattern.  The air chilled.  I felt it get colder.  I shivered.  I blinked twice, then realized the light was not blinking randomly.  It was blinking in Morse Code.  I grabbed a pencil and sheet of scrap paper from my desk and began to write.

.. - / .-- .- ... -. .----. - / ... ..- .. -.-. .. -.. . .-.-.- the light said.  It wasnt suicide.

I set my pencil down and stared at the message.  I couldnt believe it.  I read it over twice.  The light stopped blinking.  Shauna, I dont know what happened.  But Im going to find out.  With this thought in my mind, the air abruptly resumed its normal temperature.  The chills faded.

This is my chance to repay her for her kindness.  So, I am posting this here.  As hard as it is to ask you strangers for help.  Does anyone have ideas as to how I can start looking for information?  I already plan to talk to her mom more about what exactly happened in the morning.  I want to see what I can find out about Mike.  If thats even his real name.  I know Shaunas password to her computer.  Maybe I will check that out.  Because I believe that message. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Firstly, I just want to thank each and every one of you who has helped me in the past.  I really appreciate your input and thoughts.  Yes, I Google a lot of things, but nothing really beats personal "real people" experiences, and your opinions/perspectives, especially if they are different from mine are really helpful.  I feel like such a dork sometimes asking things that seem like they should be common sense.

So, (idk how closely you guys follow everything that goes on here) as you may or may not know I just switched my son over to table foods, whole milk, and some watered down juice.  The only time he gets a bottle w/ formula is for bedtime, and that's going to go once I'm finished with all the opened formula containers.

Now, how can I tell my son is getting enough hydration?  B/c for example today he had milk with breakfast, watered juice with his snack   lunch, then milk with dinner.  Then he was CRYING and saying "cup, cup" like he was begging for something to drink.  After about 30 min of almost non-stop whining I gave him cup of water, which he drank completely and he seemed happier, at least he stopped crying.

Go to change his diaper and it was completely dry (the yellow stripe turns blue when it gets wet so that's how I know for sure) - this diaper was on him for about 3 hours...is this normal?  Am I overreacting, lol?

Ehh the next new chapter of my kiddo's life e_e  Just when I was adjusted to the bottles/cups of food - something new comes up.  I guess at least #2 (if that ever happens!) will have it a lot easier lol!  Anyway thanks again!! </TEXT>

My son has recently started taking lots more table food and it's working out great.  However I am not much of a cook and we don't get home during the weekdays until 6:30-7:00 so prepping dinner in time for my son's bedtime (8:30) can be a little hairy.  What are some easy (yet relatively nutritious) fast things I can give him?  Can I make him sandwiches?  (Ie jelly, lunchmeat, etc) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tried out the new recommended talents/rotation with Enhance Shaman last night in Normal Nighthold and it's kind of weird.  I feel like the rotation is a lot more involved than it was previously.  I went from being at the top of the DPS chart to the bottom, just above the tanks.  Anyone have any tips or macros they'd like to share? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dog Keeps Eating Socks and Baby Toys...*Sigh* </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My husband and I got our dog, Dax about 4 years ago.  He is a Beagle/Bulldog mix.  He is "my" dog in that he was always closer to me, from puppyhood to adulthood.  I have always been the one to feed and water him and do the "deep cuddle sessions" with him.  (On the couch or him sleeping next to me in bed.)  Dax would occasionally eat my socks or undies, and while frustrating, it was really only once in a while.

NOW, a year after we had our son, Dax is losing his mind.  He is not interested in the baby at all.  Which is fine, he has never been aggressive toward our baby, and he is ALWAYS supervised when with the baby.

But Dax keeps eating the baby's toys and my socks....seems like more and more each day.  Dax has gotten to the point where he will go the hamper and work out my socks/undies through the little vents in the sides!!  ONLY MINE - never my husband's.  Dax will sneak off with some of the baby's small toys and chew them up, sometimes long after the baby is asleep, sometimes when the baby is playing with a couple parts but that's less common.  It's happening now pretty much every day.

I still feed   water him.  I still do the cuddles, and if anything it seems like Dax eats socks/undies/toys MORE when I cuddle him.  We're at a loss and I'm running out of $ to keep replacing my unmentionables.  Please help!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is my story.  I thought I could handle this myself, but I cant.  Im glad I found this place b/c now I can talk about it, and I know people here will believe me.  Maybe, if Im lucky people will read it and someone out there will be able to help me.  At the very least, its not about mushrooms at all.  So, theres that.

I was excited to be going away for the weekend with my Girl Scout Troop to the mountains for an indoor waterpark adventure and hiking.  I wasnt really friends with any of the other 13-year-old girls, but I was hoping that maybe this weekend would change everything.  I was going to really try to be cool, gnarly, whatever.  I wanted to fit in in the worst way.  As my mom helped me pack my bags, she was going on and on about being careful, being smart, dont do anything silly.  Yeah, mom.  I get it.  I sighed.

One of the reasons why I wasnt popular is because I was very bookish and shy.  Other girls giggled about makeup and New Kids on the Block (or whatever, I dont know what fashionable music is.  I listen to classical), while I thought it was kind of lame.  I preferred fantasy stories and drawing to these activities.  And Id clearly been excited about this trip, because Id been researching hiking in the library.  What kind of snacks to bring, what clothes to wear, etc.  I even did a mini-presentation at the last Scout meeting before we left.

Anyway, the Troop left the following Friday after school.  Everyones suitcases were packed into one of the four cars of the lucky moms that were coming to help chaperone.  As our little caravan pulled onto Highway 7, I sat in the front seat of the troop leaders car with a paperback because nobody wanted to sit next to me.  It wasnt a big deal though because I really wanted to read more of my book.  A story about a girl who was really a princess but she ran away from her father and now was living in the forest with this magical deer as her companion.  And I could probably finish it, because that highway was always crowded.

The commute was standard, nothing exciting.  Everyone divided up the beds in the three bedrooms and went to bed early in order get up early for hiking in the morning.  (I was on a pull-out couch in the corner.)  Even the next days hiking adventures went over well.  I managed to chat with every girl for a couple of minutes without having anyone laugh at me, and one girl, Kim, even complimented my suggestion of trail mix as a snack.  She even invited me to come to her bedroom that night to hang out with the rest of the girls.  I might have just wandered in anyway without an invite, but this--!  I smiled and I agreed, mentally promising myself I wouldnt say or do anything silly while I was there.

We all returned home and had a simple dinner.  The whole time everyone was chatting easily.  It almost felt like I was really fitting in and I had managed not to say or do anything too weird.  I could feel myself relaxing, not being so worried.  Eventually the dishes were cleared away and it grew dark.  Girls started slipping off to the master bedroom to hang out while the adults relaxed in the main room.  I was the last to make my way there.  All 10 pairs of eyes turned to face me as I walked into the room.

Oh hey, Danni, come on in here, called Kim.  I smiled shyly as I sat next to her on one of the cots and let my eyes wander briefly around the room.  There was 1 full-sized bed in the middle of the room and 2 cots pushed up against walls leaving most of the room open.  Everyone was sitting on a bed or cot.  Girlish chatting resumed for another 15 minutes or so, when suddenly Kim clapped her hands together.

Alright, its 10 oclock so nows the time.  Who wants to go first? Kim whispered.  My eyes widened.  I had no idea what she was talking about, but of course I didnt want to admit that.
I will! exclaimed Karen.  She was one of the cooler, popular girls in the troop.  I blinked, relieved that I would be able to watch whatever it was that was about to happen.  Karen, a little blonde wearing a purple Hypercolor t-shirt stood up and went to the middle of the room.  Kim got up and stood behind Karen, a little off to the left.  Karen took 10 big, deep breaths.  She held her breath.  Kim reached over and put her hands on Karen, where the shoulder meets the base of the neck and started pushing.  Eyes as wide as saucers now, I gaped.  I could see some of the girls watching me out of the corners of their eyes to see what I would do.  I sat on my hands and leaned forward, debating calling out for a parent.  Was this a test?  Was this a prank?  Kim slowly counted down from ten to one, and released Karen.  Karen took one step forward.  I held my own breath.  Karen laughed.

Nope, nothing happened!  everyone started giggling.  I exhaled loudly.

II, okaywhatwas that supposed to be? I cried, barely holding back tears.  Cursing myself for those tears.

Oh, its a GAME, silly.  You do this and youre supposed to pass out or something, Kim scoffed.  The mocking was back.  That foolish feeling.  Were all going to give it a go, and you should too, if you really want to be cool.

I was too shocked to talk, so I just mutely nodded.  I tried to think if it was even possible for you to pass out playing this game and where it might have come from.  I was half paying attention as we went around the room, each girl taking the breaths and Kim holding their throats.  Nothing happened, everyone laughed.  And then it was my turn.

Are you ready? Kim looked at me, honestly curious to see if Id go through with it.  I again couldnt find my voice so I nodded.  I took my position up in the middle of the room and took 10 deep breaths, holding the last one.  I could feel Kims hands, her cool palms pressing into my skin.

I woke up on the floor, scratching my head.  Kim?  Why are you in my dream?  We already drove home and the trip is over.  Wait.  No.  Whathappened?  I pushed myself up into a sitting position.  Kim was looking at me, terrified.  The rest of the girls were staring at me open-mouthed.  Great, I thought.  What have I done now?

Y-you are such a FAKER!  That is NOT how you play!!  Its just a game thats supposed to scare you, its not real!  Kim shouted.  She must have realized how bewildered I looked myself, because she lowered her voice and spoke again.  When I let you go, you fell forward on your face and didnt move for almost a minute.  I almost got my mom!  You scared the crap out of us!  Diddid it actually work?

II saw something.   I thought it was part of the dream.  I saw a line of cars.  I saw clothes floating in the air.  I saw some people running.  And then you were there, I whispered.  I shrugged and stood up, unsure of what to do.

Kim stared at me.  Are you going to tattle?  I shook my head no, and headed for bed.  I wish I had tattled, but I dont know possibly would have come from that.

My dreams were restless that night, and have been ever since.  I kept seeing terrible things.  Bad accidents.  Murders.  Things I didnt often dream about.  I chalked it up to an overactive imagination and didnt think anything of it.  Everyone avoided me for the rest of the day.  Business as usual.

A few weeks later, I was home alone after school one day.  I wandered into the kitchen, preparing to make myself a snack.  I flipped on the TV and to my horror, I saw the image from my dream.  A line of cars, clothes fluttering on smoky wind, and a few people running in the opposite direction of where the smoke looked like it was coming from with terrified expressions on their faces.  I gripped the side of counter.  My phone rang on the wall.

I jumped almost 10 feet in the air, but I went over to answer.  It was Kim, speaking so softly and almost kindly.  It was a tone Id almost never heard from her before.  Though she wasnt necessarily a friend, she was a life raft in my sea of terror at this point.  Danni, are youseeing this?  Its on all the channels.  Some crazy terrorists set off a huge car bomb on Highway 7 during rush hour.  Didwas. this what you saw?

I was silent for a long time.  What game were we playing?  Where did you hear about it from?

I-I dont know, I thought I just made it up!!  Weve played before at slumber parties, but it has never worked like that before!  Was it what you saw?? she demanded.

Kim, youve got to help me. yesyes it was what I saw, right down the colour of the shirts.  And, Ive dreaming ever since.  How do I know what else will happen? </TEXT>

<TITLE> FFS, Can You Back Off...[MIL RANT, Long] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-11 17:50:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My MIL is a really nice lady, and I really do like her.  She helped me out a lot when my son was first born.  She stayed over our house 2 days a week overnight to take care of the baby at night so my husband and I could get some sleep, and I'm forever grateful for that.

But.  Yes there is always a but.

Long story short, MIL was in Florida for a while, but now she's back in NJ and wants occasionally watch our son during the week.  Sure, it's great b/c it saves on babysitter costs.  Except...I MUST LIST ALL THE ANGER.  B/c I have specifically TOLD her not to do these things and I know she's f*cking doing it anyway.  Wait until you read the last one.

* Constantly holds son pretty much ALL DAY.  Almost no floor time.  Which messes up AJ b/c after 2 straight days of being held he thinks we're going to do that too, but we aren't.

* Refuses naps.  I explained MORE THAN ONCE that AJ needs 2 naps, and about the times he should be put down.  She puts him down, but if he whimpers even once, she decides he's not ready and plays with him even more.  (He's literally whining for sleep.)  It got so bad at one point that AJ was waking up every couple of hours at night that I said if you don't give him naps, you can't see him anymore b/c JUST NO.

* Feedings.  We are weaning AJ from formula/bottle.  I said he gets 2 bottles, 1 morning, 1 dinner (then 1 at night but she's gone by then).  She tries to give him another bottle in between morning, lunch, and dinner.  NO.  Most recently, I told her that AJ should only have Breakfast: 1 bottle, cereal.  Lunch:  Fruit cup, Dinner:  1 bottle, Veggie/meat cup.  As much watered down apple juice in his sippy cup as he wants.  NO SNACKS, NO OTHER FOOD.  (B/c he's taking an antibiotic that gives him the poops and I explained this to her.  Patiently.  Three times.)  Come to CATCH HER stuffing PEAS into AJ's face last night as I was getting his tub ready for bed.  ("Oh he's crying b/c he's hungry" -- NO HE'S NOT HE'S CRYING B/C HE IS TIRED.  Also, he can choke on peas, like....WHYYYY.)

* Weirdly opens toys that we have put away until he's older.  We have several toys that we have put away in his closet to bring out later, to rotate toys or b/c they are too old for him right now.  They aren't easily visible.  She goes in there and digs them out.  _

* Laundry holy hell.  Changes AJ's outfit like 4324239 times a day b/c he gets 1 tiny food particle on him.  Or he "messes" and then complains that my drawers are organized in a confusing way.  (Have also explained the drawer layout several times.  Patiently.  Twice.)  So he grabs all different pieces of his ALREADY MATCHED outfits and he looks messy af.  Yes, I understand sometimes you have change him if he gets poo on his clothes but OMG WOMAN HOW ARE YOU SO MESSY THAT IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

* Let's Cook Dinner.  (I work full time.  I barely cook.  If I do it's quick, healthy.)  "Oh well let's FRY ALL THE MEAT and make all these incredibly starchy foods - what do you mean you can't eat them, what do you mean you don't cook huge meals every day?"

I don't want to deny her seeing AJ, but I am considering just saying she can only watch him 1x a week.  I would literally rather pay the babysitter to watch him than have her there.  It's so freaking frustrating and when I try to talk to my husband about it he gets all weird b/c it's his mom.

Ok wow this is so long but damn I feel better venting.  Thanks.

TLDR - MIL making me crazy. T_T e_e </TEXT>

<TEXT> When my son was born, I wanted to breastfeed in the worst way and I tried so hard, so damn hard.  In the end it didn't work out b/c he couldn't latch.  When he tried to nurse it hurt so badly and he wasn't getting enough so after a month of struggling to pump even 6oz after a full day, we switched for formula.  I had asked in the hospital when he was born and when we went to our first couple of well-baby visits if he possibly had lip ties, and I was told constantly no.

WELL HAHAHA.  My son had his first dentist apt on Thurs and I asked the dentist.  GUESS WHAT.  He has an upper lip tie.  (She doesn't want to do anything with it for now, to see if his teeth grow in properly, etc.)  BUT NOW I KNOW I WASN'T A FAILURE.  I just wanted to celebrate thisssssss 3 3

And also to let other moms who may be struggling with this, or feeling this way - you are not alone! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, all.  I am a long-time lurker, so I'm sure nobody here really may recognize me.  Anyway, one of my New Year's resolutions is to do things that scare the shit out of me, but I've always wanted to try.  (Within reason, I haven't completely taken leave of my sanity.)

So, I wrote and submitted my first story to NoSleep.  I'm wondering if you kind readers of this forum can take a look at it, and give me some constructive criticisms and comments on it?  Tell me what you liked, what I did right, and where I missed the mark, or if I should just give it up.

I don't want that single story to be the only one submit here, but I cannot grow if I don't ask for assistance, either.  (And btw, the asking *also* scares the crap out of me.)

Story:  https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5mgr90/fires_in_the_distance/

And if this isn't allowed, I'm really sorry - can someone point me toward where I can find help for this from people who generally aren't tools? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Fires in the Distance </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-06 23:42:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was in my 2014 RAV 4 LTD.  A gift from my husband last Christmas.  I hadn't asked for a new car, but he had purchased it for me a surprise because we had a child on the way and I needed a "family" car.  A black Chevy truck wasn't going to cut it with a car seat.  He was right.  And besides, he specifically found a car in my favourite colour  Deep Red.

My husband was driving us down a dark, unlit road through the part of town where the farms were located.  My town, East Depton, was big enough to be almost totally houses and business, but about a third of it was still farmland.  They do call New Jersey the Garden State for a reason, after all.

It was fall and the cornstalks were growing on either side of the road.  I loved fall, the smell of fresh air and fires faintly burning in the distance.  Neighbours having bonfires next door, farmers cleaning up their fields.  The multi-coloured leaves and the crunchy noises theyd make when you stomped on them.  Sweater weather, cold enough to cuddle but not so cold that you couldnt stay outside for more than few minutes before you really started to shiver.

I wasnt worried about it being so dark.  The headlights on my SUV were brand new, and besides wed been down this road so many times before.  He was chatting about something, work, I think.  He was up for a promotion, and he wanted to have another child.  He loved our son, and he wanted our family to grow again.  With this new promotion, wed be able to comfortably afford it.  He was excited.  To be honest, I was only half listening.  I wasnt sure I wanted another child.  I thought I wanted four, and though our son was a great baby, I didnt know if I could handle the emotional stress of everything all over again.  Those first couple of months of practically sleepless nights almost killed me.  I almost lost myself.

I had cracked the window in the passenger side of the RAV 4 to smell the autumn air, the fires in the distance.  Everything was silent, other than my husbands chatting.  Suddenly there was a sharp report, a few seconds then silence.  I laughed to myself, thinking it sounded like some kind of gun fire.  I turned to mention this to my husband, when I realized the silence was total.  He had stopped talking.  He was slumped in his seat.  The car kept on.

I gasped, as we came up over a hill in the road, cornstalks giving way to charred fields, fires and houses burning on the horizon, skeletons of trees smoldering.  I could see tiny holes in the roof of the SUV over my husbands head, but I refused to look to closely at him.  I could see what looked like a helicopter swooping out of site.  Soundless.  Impossible.  My husbands foot slipped on the gas and we began to accelerate.  I gasped.  We approached a t intersection.  I grabbed the wheel, unable to stop us, hoping only to control us.

We crashed through the intersection, through a field of burning corn.  My mind clouded, hazed with smoky indecision.  Did I try to jump from the car, or try to crash into a burning tree that was quickly coming up in our path?  What do they do in movies?  Whats the safest way?  Should I just tuck and roll?  My thoughts swirled.  As the tree loomed closer, I made my choice.  I held my breath, unclicked my seatbelt, threw open the passenger side door, and jumped from the car.  As I rolled through the smoldering corn and the car crashed into the tree, I had enough time to wonder if my son had been in the back seat of the car before I passed into oblivion, the smell of fires in my nostrils, on my clothes, on my skin.... </TEXT>

<TITLE> Insurance </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-04 22:54:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am on my husband's plan as well as my own plan through my work, so basically I have 2 health insurances.  We did this b/c we were planning a baby and wanted to avoid as much out of pocket costs as possible.  I made all the phone calls, ensuring that each insurance company knew about the double coverage.  All of this was taken care of before we even started trying.

Prior to delivery I filled out all the forms carefully and provided copies of BOTH insurance cards.  After delivery I again provided all of this information.

FLASH FORWARD to now, just over a year later.  The insurance companies are STILL arguing with me over the bills.  I have called and explained this already 6 times.  The last time I called the hospital (a few months ago) they said I owed nothing.

So ummm...I'm not really sure what to do now.  At the time of his birth my son was "grandfathered" for a month under BOTH of our insurances.  WHY do I have to keep calling, and how long do I have to keep this up?  Should I just wait and see when/if the hospital will send us a new bill?  WHY IS THIS SO STUPID - we have insurance so we don't have to pay huge bills...Thankfully we are generally healthy so our insurances almost never have to pay anything out for us - ANGERRRRR.

Please someone help me lol. </TEXT>

The rematch never commented/posted that she received the gift but I see that it was delivered b/c I tracked her package and I also provided shipment proof.  My current SS messaged me to say he received it, but he did not post to the gallery.  (I am currently "pending" my shipment verification.)

Here are my questions.  Aren't you *supposed* to post to the gallery?  Since neither of them have bothered to do it and I provided verification, I will get my credits back right?  Has anyone else had their giftees not post their presents? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I made a paladin with full plate.  She lives in and has grown up in the jungle.  The other PCs berate me (somewhat seriously) for doing this b/c they claim plate would not work in the jungle.  I hadn't see any rules about this, so I'm not sure *why* this would be?  If I had went with lesser armour, wouldn't I have died quicker as I was to be the front-liner fighter?  I argued that since I grew up in the jungle I was used to wearing the armour.  It actually almost ended in a "real" fight that it shouldn't be allowed, it would be too hot, etc.  Like what?  Pretty sure as a 1/2 elf I already wouldn't be "realistic" soooo....can anyone give me some insight? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure how to simply explain this without going into too many details, so I will try my best to keep this short.  My husband is agnostic.  I was raised Catholic but I have relinquished that title and now would probably be qualified more as pagan, if anything.  Both of us don't believe in organized religion.  (But hey if that's your thing, we are totally respectful of it!!)

My parents are pushing us to baptize our son.  At first I was open to it, but then I thought...where will it end?  Will they push the issue of confession, confirmation?  It's one thing if my son says he wants these things, or is curious about them when he's older...

My mother has claimed that she will "just take him and do it without us" - like what?  (This is even more amusing b/c she only goes to church on Easter and Christmas...)

I don't know what else to say, other than we want to raise AJ to live by the "be excellent to everyone" motto.  If he has specific questions, we will answer him.  I...I don't even know what my original question was, I guess how do I deal with this?  I'm so stressed and upset about this :/ </TEXT>

Today I when I get home it's dark except for my porch light and Christmas lights...so, I can see but not really.  I check my mailbox and I see a pink, foiled package inside.  My stomach flops with excitement!  I'm hype.  I feel like I'm 5.  I stuff the package under my arm and carry in my bags and other stuff.

The second I'm through the door I throw the bags to the side and hold up the pink, sparkly envelope...only to see that it's my Ipsy order.  I died a little inside, then started laughing so hard my SO came upstairs to check on me.  Well, RIP - but tomorrow is another day :D

TLDR - Saw sparkly package in mail.  Thought was gift.  Was not, in fact, gift. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm working on a project using this technique (it's a little stuffed football!) and it's coming along but it looks a little crude in some places.  I was just wondering if anyone had some advice for this...I can post a pic later tonight if needed.

1.)  When I have to m1, the stiches are very noticeable.  Is there some way I can reduce this?

2.)  The part where the stitches are split on the needles is REALLY wide even though I'm tugging them closer together.  It's not so wide that the stuffing will fall out, but it doesn't look pretty.

Thanks :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have played WoW since 2008 and a huge part of that reason is the friends I've made while playing this game.  Being in a guild is, for me, an extension of my family.  I'm outgoing and friendly so even if I join a guild that I didn't already know someone in previously (as sometimes happens when other guilds would break up) I would have no problems joining groups and getting to know the other guildmates.

So my question is this.  To those of you that don't join guilds - why?  Why do you prefer to play a game that seems to be made to play together with friends solo? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Is it me, or has tab targeting gotten a bit wonky lately?  I used to have little to no problem tabbing in melee.  It would choose the next reasonably close mob in the pack and I could keep attacking w/ little interruption in my rotation, but now it seems like whenever I hit tab it targets a mob 1/2 way down the hall and nowhere close to the action.  Did I accidently change a setting someplace or is this just broken?

<TITLE> 1 Year Old: All the Weaning...[Help] </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At the end of the month, my LO will be 1 year old.  From what I've read and what my pediatrician has said, lots of things will be changing.
* No more pacifier
* No more bottle
* No more formula (he's EBF)
* No more nighttime bottle
So, I'm just asking for how you handled the above.  Here's what I *think* will work...plz feel free to give advice.
* No more pacifier - He doesn't use it much, only when tired.  So I will start by only giving it to him at nap/bed time for a month, then just bedtime, then after another month, stop all together.
* No more bottle - He's already using a sippy cup somewhat.  I think I will give him all milk in this throughout the day, then a final nighttime bottle.
* No more formula - I'll begin by transitioning...his morning cereal will be mixed with milk   his morning bottle will be milk, then after a week I will replace his lunch bottle with milk, then another week all 3 of his bottles will be milk.  (Is that *too much* milk?  I'm not really sure.)
* No more nighttime bottle - Okay well I have no idea how to swing this one.  He gets 7oz before bed.  Maybe drop it 5, then 3, then none?  :/

Thanks, parents!! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was (until recently) on a pvp server that was very Alliance-heavy.  Now it seems that we have been secretly merged with a couple of servers that are Horde-heavy and now we are vastly outnumbered.  So here's my questions about server merging in general:

*When Blizz merges a server, why don't they dissolve server A and B and create server C?

*How does Blizz decide what servers merge together?

*Does Blizz always announce what servers are going to merge?

*Is the entire game now cross-realm?  (Maybe my server hasn't been merged at all and they've just made it this way?)

*Does Blizz merge servers to give players more of a chance to interact, or b/c it helps keep their systems from working too hard, perhaps preserving their resources? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Entering Return to Kara Bug...? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last night I was trying to finish up Kara.  (We only had Viz up, idk if this matters.)  We formed the group, and whenever the tank would try to zone in, he'd die instantly and be ported out.  He was automatically released and then had to rez, then it would happen again and again.

It took us 3 tanks before we figured out a kind of work-around.  You have to enter literally 1 step at a time until you get the loading screen.  That is, the tank couldn't just run into the instance.  He had to walk One.  Step.  At.  A.  Time.

Anyway, has this happened to anyone else while trying to complete Kara, or any other instance?  I wasn't sure if it was a bug somehow related to my lockout or just Blizzard in general, or some other third thing. </TEXT>

I had been feeling so confident that I bought myself a pair of long, wide legged pants to wear to my office.  Well, getting all dressed up took a few extra minutes so I found myself running behind and that I was going to miss the bus unless I seriously hustled.  I saw the bus coming down the road.  I decided that now would be the perfect time to start running.  As I started moving, I felt really good.  I was going to make it!  I wasn't even winded or breaking a sweat.  I'm at the corner now, just have to cross the street and I will make the bus!!  UNTIL.  My foot got tangled and caught in the wide bell of my pant leg and I fell --no, I dove head first into the middle of the road and skidded to a stop.  I disentangled myself from my pants only to look up and see the bus HAD to stop, or else I was going to get ran over.  (RIP)  I picked myself up, pulled little pebbles from my palms and, well yeah, at least I wasn't late for work.... </TEXT>

Search checks, heal checks, spot checks, etc and that you will be successful in the end, so it's worth it to take the extra time.  Now, he's not *totally* wrong, but if you're searching for a trap, wouldn't a "1" mean you've set off the trap?  Or if a character is at -8, taking 20 to heal would mean the character would die before you've had a chance to sufficiently heal him, wouldn't he?  Please share your opinions on this...

I've changed a couple talents, and now I have gear (852 ilvl) but I only average about 170k dps.  I have WeakAuras, things are enchanted/gemed (except my neck I will admit, I'm too poor for a 20k+ enchant right now, heh).  I feel like I'm missing something, but I don't know what.  (Tried talking to the other Enhance Shaman in the guild but he completely blew me off.)  So, I turn to you...was anyone else in this situation?  Were they missing something simple?
