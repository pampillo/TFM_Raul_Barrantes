Regardless of how the GT2 shakes out, the one bit of good news is that Preuninger was adamant that manual transmission options on GT cars are here to stay. 


What was the short hand saying?  GT3 is 99% track focused, the GT2 is a turbo'd version of the GT3 that is given an allowance for driving on the road?

That's what I assumed would be the case going forward.   </TEXT>

1 Racist South.  The Magnum was seen as "a black person's car" (whatever the hell that meant/however the hell people came to that conclusion) so all the racist shit heads would turn their nose up at it.  Playing blues shows in redneck bars.  They can listen to black music but I can't drive "a black car"?  Get the fuck out of my face.

2 FCA product, so my decent people in my social circles who were car folk bummed on it for being FCA.

3 The rest of the people just thought it was ugly.  And honestly, it kinda was.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is TxTag running a racket? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-06 02:16:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Seems every few months I get a notice in the mail about unpaid toll and toll violations, violation fees, etc.  

Today I received a letter in the mail from a collections agency over unpaid tolls from September of last year.

The problem is is that I have an online account and an associated bank account that auto drafts for my fees and even drafts an additional $40 buffer amount.  I have transponders on both cars, I pulled my TxTag statements from the time frame last year and the month afterwards both showing I have 0 late payments, fees, or violations.  I've eMailed the collection agency those two statements as well as my most recent statement showing 0 violations and that my account is in good standing.  It also shows both of my vehicles passing tolls and being charged without a problem.

This happens every few months and every time in the past it's been a "Oh it must have been a glitch in the system we'll just square up the tolls and delete the violation fees".

I'm gonna call TxTag Monday, see if they have a record of the last time I called in, ask them why they didn't advise me of violation fees then, etc.

Any other advice would be appreciated.  .



edit

The collections agency is closed on the weekend but someone got back to me via eMail.  Basically said they're 100% hands off, just take the info that TxTag sends them.  They told me I can call TxTag and if it gets sorted out on their end then they're automatically updated on theirs.  We'll see what happens Monday.



edit

Yup.  "Sorry, system error.  We'll take the fee off and you'll only have to pay the actual toll." 

Same song and dance.  I got a confirmation number this time though.

<TEXT>  What is Alfa waiting for?

For the QV and Stelvio to release properly, them to sell out or sell all of the first run/reserved.  

There's a bunch of demand for these.  Alfa San Antonio had a QV on display only.  I stopped by to check it out and there were at least another 12 there.  I was told that reservations were lacking.

They called me the other day to let me know they'd have a Stelvio in for inspection as well, not even the Quadrifoglio.  I'm not gonna show up for that but it's in demand as well.

No point in running a special on a vehicle they can't provide just yet.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  that every UBI game is a failure

Depends on how you define it.

Sales only?  Complete success.  But sales isn't the barometer anymore, but instead, a long and healthy community buying post release content.

In that regard, Ubi ain't doing so hot.  Division sold a ton and then the community died.  Same for Wildlands.  For Honor has less active players than both.  

They probably are NOT hurting financially.  But given that they're about to be taken over by a corporate overlord their track record of being unable to build games that foster lasting communities is going to be a mark against them.  </TEXT>

Probably not.  997 has the better reputation than the 996, but it depends on the model.  997.1S manuals and 997.2 manuals and PDK will probably hold pretty well.  Especially the Turbos.

The NA engines will probably see a big benefit in value due to the swap over to an all turbo/small engine platform. </TEXT>

A better way of going about it would have been to solicit feedback and prompt people to voice it via an off site anonymous poll.  

Instead you took the advice of a very small minority and framed the issue as one of appeasing them first and not the actual community.

Also, who cares if they get downvoted?  It's part of Reddit and it is of absolutely no consequence.  Mods aren't here to shield people from feeling hurt due to a down vote.  </TEXT>

Leslie - Cross dressing hippie from Austin, TX who basically OG kept Austin Weird.

So you take something like Monk Fish liver.  It's kinda fishy but it's pretty good but otherwise inoffensive. 

Or Crispy Ray Fin which is basically just fried manta ray.  Good, flaky, not funky at all, totally Kenny G.

Then you take something like the Salted Cod Row which is both strange and funky cause it's fishy and salty.  Way up there.  Weird and different like Leslie.

And then you have Natto, which looks like thick slime colored edamame that is covered in bonito (dried fish) flakes and tastes like the scum you could scrape off the bottom of a dumpster.  AKA you nasty for eating this.   </TEXT>

BMW uses Grade A materials, but the design is very conservative and iterative and dated.  

Maybe this will make sense:  BMW's Interior is to Audi's Exterior.  

Or something like that.  I tried to remember that "antonym game" I played in grade school where you:to the::thing:like this but I don't remember the "rules".  Know what I'm talking about?  

Anyway, that's my philosophy on car interiors.  They're like grade school word games.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're not "bad", and my Saab comment is a bit tongue in cheek, but like Saab versus the competition back in its day and BMW now, I don't think they hold a candle, **especially** since Audi and MB have updated their design language significantly.  Audi, Volvo, Mercedes, and Porsche have all drastically updated their interiors.  The new 5 series interior is just a refresh of the existing one.

A buddy of mine had a late 2000s 9-3 convertible.  Probably the best looking car they had, probably the best interior they ever made, and even though it got rid of those super ugly air vents, it still wasn't great.

Seats were comfy though.

<TEXT> Literally.  Wife's boss called me a few weeks back to pick my brain over a new car.  All his kids are finally gone and he got to buy *something fun*.

"Well, if you got the cash, then a 911, Boxster, or 718 is the way to go man."

He texted her to tell me to check his FB.  He bought a TTS.

So why'd you get the TTS?

"I liked the styling better, I liked the interior more, and while the Porsche drove better in the end, it didn't drive 30k better."

He made a good and well informed choice after test driving the various vehicles.  Glad he got the TTS, it's a hell of a car.  If they made an actual TTS cabrio instead of a roadster I'd consider one of them over a 718 myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cocktails were on point.  I had the old fashioned and the gin drink and tequila based drink that comes in the tulip glass.  Well mixed and balanced.

Did not get the ramen or BBQ, but we plan on going back again this weekend.  I'll have one of the ramen bowls or we'll see if the rest of the table would like to split the BBQ boat.

Chicken Heart - Basically red meat chicken.  Flavor was great but it was room temp when it got to the table.  Offal needs to be good and warm when served.

Corned Beef Tongue - On the specials menu, also very well balanced, incredibly tender as well.  The pickled onions were so-so but I really dug the pickled mustard seed.

Squid fritters - Forgot what they're called.  Come with some tortilla strips and a spoonful of chili.  Could use more chili and the fritter was more fritter than squid.  Only disappointment the whole night, really.  

Street corn - Surprisingly good, actually.  Comes covered in mayo, fish flakes, lemon, and something else.  Probably not bonito, but maybe?  Not really fish flakes but shaved strands of something that is fishy which I assumed to be bonito.

Munkfish liver - It is what you think it is.  Very fishy pate.  Incredible texture, served at the appropriate temperature.


Things I didn't try that I want to try:

Dank tofu.  Dank due to the blue cheese and not because it is stinky tofu, which it isn't.  I don't like stinky tofu!

Natto - I don't like stinky tofu, and I'm pretty sure this is just the king stank of stinky tofu, but I want to be able to say I tried it.

Dipping ramen - I hear it's the best way to have their chili and I've never had dipping ramen before.

Puff puff pass - Communal alcohol drink.  Looks fun.  



I definitely dug it.  It will probably go on my list of regular meeting places for when me and some friends get afternoon drinks/snacks when we're in that area.  Usually we just hit up Whip In.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Xiaolongbao are a similar size but don't have lots of juice inside

What?  Of course they do.  

Tangbao are "bao" sized, like shenjianbao, or the size of a fist.  The wrapper is a bit similar to xiaolongbao though.  Tangbao is often served with a straw for you to drink the soup out of the middle.

 Neither is served in a soup

This is correct. </TEXT>

If I'm highway cruising?  No, but then if I'm highway cruising, I'd be in 7th in the Porsche anyway, so it's a wash.  Most of my driving is on city through-ways where the speed limit is around 50.  So hit it to 50 and keep the revs high for merging/etc.  

The C300's torque is something like 280 at 2500, the C43 is something like 380 at 2000.  Carrera S is 325 5600.  C43 beats it out there, but there's a 50hp difference in the Carrera's favor, so while I'd feel it to a degree between the C43 and the S, the 0-60 is pretty much the same on both.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cooking for some friends this weekend and I want to try and make one of my favorite dishes from one of my favorite restaurants.  [Here's a pic of it I grabbed from Yelp](http://i.imgur.com/nrHrnTQ.jpg).  Menu lists: "Seafood" Nam Jim, mint, cherry tomato, cilantro, lemon grass, kafir lime.

So what stumps me a bit is that I think the menu listing is incomplete.  For one because they also serve it with watermelon radish, and for two there is a definite floral note on the dish that I can't place.

Also, I know that basic nam jim is more or less fish sauce + lime juice + sambal + sugar.  I wonder what makes this a "seafood" fish sauce.  I know they use ground dried shrimps in a few of the menu items but those usually add a very fishy/seafood flavor to those dishes, definitely not here.

[Here's the menu](http://i.imgur.com/jaLZbMF.jpg) for anyone interested.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cross shopped a ton of these in 2015.  Well, the 328i and not the Volvo or the Giulia.

I came away:

C300

328i

A4

ATS

Jag

Infiniti

Lexus



C300 had the more "spirited" engine and better or on par handling over the majority.  328i had an amazing transmission.  Infiniti won out over the Lexus simply because it had a slightly less jank interior. 

I also looked into a Ghibli and cross shopped the A6, S4, 528, and test drove a Quattroporte and Panamera, but I wanted to make sure I could end up with my current 3 car setup so passed on those.

I prefer RWD and think Audi is too conservative in their styling though.  

I did the same with my C300.  Tested the A4, didn't particularly care for it.  The C300 will probably be replaced with a Giulia in another year.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue with turbo lag in slightly older cars isn't so much as the turbo lag being the problem but the slower automatic transmission.  It sometimes takes about a second to shift from high gear down to low, and then maybe a half second to build up enough RPM to get that turbo torque.  That's what you feel the most and is the biggest problem.

<TEXT> My previous car was a 4300 pound Hemi that was awesome and while I consider tracking one down again, the C43 has been a significantly more fun and more agile car to drive.  Other than the Hemi being a station wagon, the C43 seems to be significantly more usable in day to day situations. 


edit

And the C43 has a much better transmission compared to the C450/C300.    </TEXT>

If this were at a restaurant that has those "lazy susan" type round tables, which has been my experience 100%, you just spin the plate back in front of the mother and insist.

But don't blame the girl either.  Judgemental Asian Parents are impossible to please.  If they so deem it there will not be any correct behavior.   </TEXT>

Bzzzzt.  You're offered to eat first, but the etiquette is that you then take what is offered to you and insist on lao ma enjoying it before anyone else.

If you're coming from a C63 then yeah, you'll notice it.  However, I wouldn't get too worked up over it not "feeling quite right".  People complain about that since the industry has gone from NA 8 to forced induction sixers.  C43 is a fast enough car, you're only gonna miss out on torque and that v8 sound.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't jack shit about Linux Routing so I'm gonna ask some I Don't Know Jack Shit comments to figure this out.  Please forgive me.

 set interfaces ethernet eth0 vif 30 address 10.7.50.5/24

Performed on R1 and R2.

This tags eth0 with vlan (virtual interface?) tag 30 with the ip address of 10.7.50.5.  You essentially did the same thing on R2 but instead changed the IP to 10.7.50.6.



 set interfaces bridge br0

 set interfaces ethernet eth0 vif 24 bridge-group bridge br0

Performed on A and C

Top command creates the bridge0 interface and the bottom command associates the eth0 interface with vlan tag 24 as well as bridge0.


Now these commands:

 edit interfaces vxlan vxlan0

 set bridge-group bridge br0

 set group 239.0.0.241

 set vni 241

These are run on both A and C.  Why do you use edit interfaces instead of set for creating the vxlan interface?

Wouldn't you also need to run the above commands on R1 and R2 as well to bridge the virtual layer 2 doman across R1 and R2? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a revelation to me but maybe you all knew it already.  Seems like right around the time I saw a Chipotle or two pop up we suddenly had three or four competitors within six months.  

Now the same is happening with Poke and Ramen.  

The best thing is when you get local places that jump in with a similar offering to compete as well.  Though we had a home grown ramen place here first and now we have Jinya opening up and two others (Agu and one more chain I can't recall).  Same with Poke.

We even have a local Panda Express clone here called General Tso'boy which basically adds sandwiches to the menu.   </TEXT>

I got brought on to relieve some other SEs who are over worked but not much is actually thrown my way, so I basically spend my days taking cert practice exams and not actually working.

<TEXT> Curious if this would make a great little cruiser from time to time, reliability, etc.  Looking at the market though, prices seem to be absolutely all over the place regardless of quality.  I see some low mileage ones in solid condition in the 20s, I see a low mileage one slightly better interior for 100k+ on eBay.

If the Bonneville isn't a good option for whatever reason, what's another option to look at?

I am not opposed to a Cadillac DeVille either.  



Mid 60s to mid 70s.  Though in the case of the Caddy and the Pontiac the late 80s models aren't terrible to look at either!   </TEXT>

Panamera.

"It drives almost like a 911."

I'll be the judge of that.

Holy shit it does feel like a Panamera.


2015 C300 refresh.  Transmission is a bit lazy but everything else about that car blows the BMW equivalent out of the water.

Also the C43  The 335/340.  C63 doesn't have shit on the M3 though, and performs even worse up against the M2.   :(



Unpleasant -

Audi A3 -  It's a Volkswagen and not even the good one.

Audi Q5 - Helped a friend pick out an SUV for herself.  The Q5 was decent and she almost went for it but the interior was garbage and the VW Outback was ultimately the better driving car.

<TEXT>  Was it malicious?

Mao had seen what the concentration of industry in major cities did to China pre Revolution.  He saw what it did to the Soviet Union.  It left the cities comparatively comfortable while the countryside remained poor as dirt and incredibly ignorant.  The peasants had 0 chance of ever becoming anything other than a peasant and lived their lives hoping for some good old "trickle down" economics to drip out of the cities.

The industrialization drive during the GLF was an attempt at "democratizing" access to industry, to prevent the solidification of the peasant class, and to make all of China equal in production.

They just kinda went about it the wrong way.

Or, maybe if they had the internet where information was known instantaneously instead... </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The popularity of carrot cake was revived in Great Britain because of rationing during the Second World War.[5] Carrot cakes first became commonly available in restaurants and cafeterias in the United States in the early 1960s. They were at first a novelty item, but people liked them so much that carrot cake became standard dessert fare.[citation needed] In 2005, the American-based television channel Food Network listed carrot cake, with its cream-cheese icing, as number five of the top five fad foods of the 1970s. Carrot cake was voted as the favourite cake in the United Kingdom, according to a survey in the Radio Times in 2011.



I find this suspect.  The article requires a citation itself and I remember my grandmother talking about how they would eat carrot cake during the depression, well before the 1960s.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have a Prius as a baby driver.  My wife was "not a car person".  She bought a Fiat, which was garbage, and then a Prius for the space and gas mileage and was happy with that until she drove my C300 and then she kinda realized why one would want a German car (responsiveness, handling, comfort, etc).  So she would increasingly leave the house for work earlier than I and would take the C300, stranding me with the bathtub.  

I drive significantly less miles than she, work from home often, so I figured I'd get something as a weekender/occasional daily for myself and ended up with the C43.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you have a baby?  No?  Don't need the E class.


Do you give a shit at all about how your car sounds?  Do you drive your car hard at all?  You want something that is torquey as fuck?  C43.

Just want something stylish and comfortable to drive?  C300 and take the run flats off of it.  Actually, if it is in your budget, take the run flats off of whatever you choose.

Considering getting a completely fucking loaded C43?  Suck it up and spring for the C63.  

The engine on all of these cars is fantastic, and the new 9 speed is pretty good, but the 2016 and below with the 7 speed?  7 speed is super fucking lazy.  So if you are an enthusiast then I'd get 2017 and stick with it.  If you don't care and it's never gonna leave Comfort mode it doesn't matter.

MY2015 C300 has the best interior.  E Class didn't update until this year, the 2016 have the really old interior.  Thing still has a phone number pad on it.  Looks like an Atari controller.

I have a C43 Cab and a C300.  Really considering getting rid of the C300 and getting a Panamera.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Will Afla's uniqueness and apparent quality travel upstream and benefit Maserati? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-02 01:33:03 </DATE>

<TEXT> Just curious.

Was looking at Mas' a while back and the "Italian Engine wrapped in a Chrysler 200" reputation was *well* deserved.  It was a complete **joke** that they were asking for as much money as they were given all the corners they cut, parts and style wise.

Too bad what with the exterior styling being on point, performance being decent, and the engine sounding fantastic.

I had completely written off Alfa as well.  I test drove a 4C when our local dealership got the first one in.  Cramped, unnecessarily underpowered, and a bit expensive.  Wife bought a Fiat and we ended up selling it 10 months later due to problems with the computer and the car magically getting stuck in auto-manual shifting mode, which lead to some closer redlines more than once.  And the general Fiat offerings being kinda garbage.

So basically I expected 0 out of Alfa.  But the Giulia and the Giulia Quadriwhatsit have gotten some astonishingly great feedback.  Their SUV seems to be reviewing very well.  The interiors are actually pretty damn amazing as well.  Other than the fact that the front of the cars looks like a fucking emoji ( :- ) I'd be on board.

So what would this mean for the bigger sister marque?  Surely Maserati can do better than to spruce up a garbage econobox and then ask 80k for it.

<TEXT> Yeah, I keep gauging the difference between an older 997 turbo, a first gen NA 991, or just going all out and murdering my bank account and picking up a 991.2 as soon as they start flooding the CPO market.

In my head it's all "280 horse power at 4500.  I just KNOW I'll feel that" yet I'm pretty sure at no point in time have I ever gotten into a tuned NA engine and felt "not enough torque this thing is slow".  A first gen base 991 still has a quicker 0-60 than my turbo'd C43.  Gotta keep reminding myself that whenever I start looking at sticker price and performance.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Out of curiosity I checked out their site. Nothing seems worth the price tag. You can price up an MKZ with a 400hp turbo 3.0l V6 for $50k... with front wheel drive. The only other option is all wheel for another $3g's. They seem nice overall, but geez that seems to be a lot for a front wheel drive sedan.

Pretty sure the 400hp option is AWD only, FWD version of that is limited to 350hp.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Diners have commitment issues, it seems.

The places I routinely return to do one of several things:

1 Act like they care.  Even trendy and hip places that drop the pretense and just act like they're your friend after you've come by a few times goes a long way.  First time I ever ate at Uchiko it was my and my wife's anniversary.  Tyson Cole was there that night, over heard us talking about it, introduced himself, and made us a few things off menu.  "We're thinking of adding this to our menu, what do you think?"  

The sushi place we frequent the most is pretty good but nothing ground breaking.  But the night my wife gave birth she wanted sushi and this place was right behind the hospital.  I walk in and they see the admittance bracelet on my arm.  "Oh another one of these guys!"  They congratulated me with a free drink and comped a few things on my bill.  Now we stop by two, maybe three, times a month and it's fun to joke around with the guys and gals who helped me relax and laugh after a very stressful 24 hours.

2 Have *real* stuff on the menu.  My favorite Thai place?  It has trendy fusion stuff.  But it also has real deal unadulterated stuff like ground pork sauteed in it's own blood + shrimp paste + fish sauce.  And it's served in a trendy way but it's still a fully authentic dish.  It's like the drink Fernet.  I take a shot, don't like it, and then a week later start finding myself thinking about it and then I go back and get it again, until it's something I like and eat without making a face every time.

3 Amazing god damned food for an amazing god damned price.  Back in my home town in the deep south this Vietnamese place opened up.  Sandwiches were four bucks, they baked their own bread, and the restaurant was a dude running the register and the 65 year old 80 pound grandmother in the kitchen.  Service was slow as fuck but they were such a quaint couple and the food was so god damned good that it didn't matter, we went all the time.  We just called in ahead.




There are plenty of places that are 5/5 and fantastic experiences that I will only go to one time.  I'm impressed with all the wild shit people are doing with pork face now days, but only so many restaurants can have that on their menu before they all start running together. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I left a 3/5 Yelp review for a restaurant. They PM'd me, want to send me a gift cert and invited me to ask for them directly next time I visit. What do? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-04 04:46:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was not scathing in my review.  My problem with them is slow dinner service.  Lunch service is always reasonably timely and the food has been great every visit. 

Been to dinner service 3 times, each a Friday night.  First two times it was slower than I am generally okay with but not a deal breaker.  Last visit, however, it took approximately 30 minutes to get our first round, almost an hour for our apps, and then another 30 minutes for our entree.  All in all, a table of six was there for almost three hours.  

Still not a deal breaker as we'll be back.  But maybe not for dinner service.  And that's why I mainly posted the review, some folks just don't have time for three hours + travel time some nights.

I was not scathing and mentioned the food was great every visit, listed my favorite options.

So they asked if I thought it was a problem with FOH or kitchen.  I let them know that a table of four next to us had similar timing, and a table of two received slightly quicker service.

I don't want a gift cert as I didn't write the review to "extort" one out of them, and if I do go back for dinner service and things are better I'll make sure to update.  I certainly don't want to meet a manager or have them dote over me either and they got better things to do than to babysit me.  I know they'd like me to change the review and I will if my next experience is better.

Should I ignore the last PM?  Should I tell them thanks but no thanks?  Should I suck it up and accept their graciousness?  Should I just delete the review?  

I do certainly appreciate them at least making the effort of wanting to improve their service.

<TEXT> Talking with someone earlier today, who seems to know their stuff, they advised to not believe the fud you see regarding the 991 versus the 997.2 (worse handling, mainly).

But I've also seen people compare the torque curves to both.  I don't know what the 991's torque looks like at @ 4400 on it's climb to 5600.  997.2's peak torque was 288 @ 4400, 991.1 is 287 @ 5600.

Just curious if the issue with the 997.2's torque peaking and then bottoming out was addressed with the 991.  </TEXT>

The Prius is a good tool here as well.

<TEXT> A Cab?  Or a 2012?



They're generally more expensive than the equivalent coupe going by what I see on the Porsche finder.

I want a cab because I've always had a convertible of one type of the other, except for the past 6 or 7 years or so.  It was something I always enjoyed having and taking one out on the weekend is a "simple pleasure".

It's something I've missed and now that things are stable it's something I'd like to pick up again.  So why not do it with a Porsche?

<TEXT> Everyone else has given you good advice, but also look for a car that *you feel confident in*. "Enthusiasts" will poop on an SUV but people like them because they both feel more sturdy **and** have higher sitting positions so you have a better view of the road and what is around you.

If that's what it takes to get you feeling good about driving, then consider it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Have you owned a Mercedes, if you have did you have any major issues?

C300 and  C43 Cabrio.

C300 has a slightly lazy transmission when in sport+, but that's just the transmission and not particularly a problem.  I think if you have the new 9 speed you avoid that.  Also, the solenoid that shifts/clicks into park/drive is loud.  Some issues with the interior as well and the C300's stock stereo system is obviously made for old men to listen to talk radio.  

I'm one of the lucky ones who has a C300 before they neutured the hard shifts in sport+ mode.

Haven't had the C43 long enough to know of any outstanding issues and it may get traded for a GLC43 Coupe.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, same platform.

The way I always read it/hear it is that if you take a German car and get it's maintenance preformed at the proper intervals you'll be able to make it last.

That said, someone posted a link on this sub not long ago that rated the top 10 engines currently on the market and the C 300's engine was on it.

The M274 platform has been out there for quite some time, since at least MY 2012.  Other than wrist pin problems for early 2015 cars 2.0 liter variant, I haven't heard of any significant issues.

<TEXT> Bought my mom a 2017 Civic Coupe.

I wanted to put her into a Mazda 3 but there was only one Mazda dealer in her State that wasn't a 4 hour drive and their sticker was higher than the other dealerships.  They wouldn't budge.

So I wanted to buy a Mazda but Mazda wouldn't sell me one.

Depending on end of 2017 I may just get a 718 if there's a good CPO out there.

Or just trade the baby-mobile in and get a Cayenne GTS.

<TEXT> Not particularly.  If after all of your expenses and savings a month, a car is 40% or less of the remaining funds, then you're good IMO.  

After taxes/401k you bring home 6k?  1500 goes to rent/mortgage, 1000 goes to utilities/cell/etc.  Another 1500 goes into savings, that gives you 2k left for fun expenditures.  

A 70k car depending on down payment can run around 650 a month.  

If you're the type that really cares about the car you drive and aren't a bar hopper/foodie/gamer/etc, that's a perfectly reasonable financial situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it ever possible to to get them to readjust the residuals higher?

Wouldn't that lead to leasing a CPO being a good thing?  Residuals on a CPO would be a much smaller % difference between sticker price and, say, three years out than residuals on a new car off the lot.   </TEXT>

I was sinking 1500 into my 06 Dodge Hemi every other month due to constant issues.  It was 10 years old and had 200k miles, but still.

I was hoping to get one more year out of it before she was hit and killed by a drunk driver. </TEXT>

Otherwise, it's not a bad vehicle for a first car.


 People say the car feels stiff, what does that mean?


Stiff suspension, definitely compared to a Prius (my wife has one and I have a C300).  Run flats make it a more bumpy ride.  But it isn't unbearable.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> 991.1 to 991.2 owners, how has the change been? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-21 16:07:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm still biding my time before making the jump into a 911.  I was originally looking at a CPO 2014 4 Cabrio.  But now I'm not so sure, and am thinking of waiting a few years to catch the 991.2 when it starts hitting the CPO market.

Why?

I've almost exclusively driven turbo'd cars and have gotten spoiled by the instant torque availability and the light touch/sensitive throttle mapping.  The last natural intake car I had was a 6.1 liter Hemi.  I loved that car and it was a beast to drive but you had to work for it, constantly.  

That's how I feel when I've driven any non Turbo Porsche, and probably can expect the same for the 991.1.  

Granted, my Hemi had something like 900 pounds on a 911 so its not a 1:1 comparison.

For those that drove, or daily'd, a 991.1 and then swapped to a .2, how different is it?  Is it such a change that you couldn't imagine going back to a 991.1?  Does the 991.2 just feel quicker than the 991.1? </TEXT>
