<TEXT>  But precisely! They DIDN"T actually assess infants with caregivers who weren't of their race! Meaning - this has nothing to do with preference for MATERNAL race, and everything to do with preference for CAREGIVER race.

So they didn't assess one factor that could be relevant to the findings, therefore that *must* be the only factor? That's not how science works. 

The reason I've pointed this out TWICE now (you know, 'keep resharing'), is because YOU are the one who is making assumptions about the study by claiming this has anything to do with preference towards own race. 

Actually no. All I've done is share the press release from the study, the claim that "infants have preference toward their own race" is a finding of the researchers. 

There are other studies that support this finding too. The real claim from this study is that it occurs *earlier* than previously expected. </TEXT>

You actually *don't know* that because, as you point out in the comment you keep resharing, they *didn't* actually assess infants with caregivers who weren't of their race.

You're right about the limitations of the study, but your answer to these findings is still hypothesizing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Positive people don't ignore the negative emotions, quite the contrary. People who choose the positive reaction experience the negative emotion, but let it pass like a fart in the wind. They don't dwell on it and let it ruin their day. They simply say "shit happens and I'll be happy anyways".

Sometimes negative emotions are worth sitting down with and digesting. It's not always appropriate to just brush them off and say "shit happens." Properly managing your negative emotions can be much deeper than that.

I'm certainly not against a positive or optimistic outlook, but there's a balance too. This article is specifically referring to people who feel like they *always* have to be positive and plaster on a smile no matter what. That's the type of unhealthy avoidance / suppression of negative emotions that is being referred to in the article.

Giving yourself the time and space to digest negative emotions can paradoxically make you less negative overall. Because you understand the process of your emotions and you let them run their course, they end up having less power over you.

This is essentially what "equanimity" refers to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very true. Though I think taking responsibility for other living things can be equally beneficial. I just finished reading [The Power of Meaning](http://amzn.to/2nDXAv3) today and it mentions a study about how senior citizens who were given a plant to take care of also reported better mental health symptoms and increased longevity. Having responsibility over something - *anything* - can be a great motivation to live. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Factors that enable an effective Democratic Socialist state:

- Small population (Most of the top 10 is countries under 10 million people, compare that with the United States' 330 million. This can make a big difference when trying to organize a government bureaucracy that is functional and not corrupt. The economist Hayek's insights into the "Socialist Calculation Problem" are particularly relevant here. Population size matters. Think about the difficulty between organizing a party for 10 people vs. a party for 100 people.)

- Homogeneous (It's been shown that countries that are more homogeneous are more willing to pay higher taxes to fund social welfare program like "free education" or "free healthcare." I remember first reading about this in the book [Blue Zones](http://amzn.to/2mM2Nwl). Norway, for example, is 97% European descent and 93% Norwegian)

- High IQ (Nations with higher IQs tend to produce more wealth, have higher social trust and social cohesion, and have less corrupt governments. Check out the book [Hive Mind](http://amzn.to/2n48irE) if you'd like to learn more about the influence of IQ on a national level)

All of these factors are a big reason why the United States is hardly comparable to the top nations. It's not just a matter of difference in policy, there are real demographic factors that exist. </TEXT>

A hot-cold empathy gap is a cognitive bias in which people underestimate the influences of visceral drives on their own attitudes, preferences, and behaviors. The crux of this idea is that human understanding is "state-dependent". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Identity politics:

a tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances

There's nothing in this definition that specifies "classes that aren't advantaged."

Advantaged or not, whites have distinct interests, values, and experiences and they would rather live in a society that reflects those values - just like every other group.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) Goleman is certainly a psychologist. He has done research and run programs for Yale University, University of Illinois, and currently co-directs the "Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations" at Rutgers University.

2) There *are* ways EQ is measured. Here is a [list of several different measures](http://www.eiconsortium.org/measures/measures.html).

3) I really like Jordan B. Peterson, but this isn't the first time I've seen him take a hard stance on something he doesn't appear to understand. Especially since he is someone that still draws a lot of his work from a psychoanalytic framework, which isn't exactly known for its scientific robustness.

4) There are legitimate reasons to question the robustness of certain EQ measures - it's still a fairly new concept and more research is definitely needed. Though I think *intuitively* we all understand that some people manage their emotions better than others. </TEXT>

Some of these are more serious/darker than others (Louie/Bojack/Wilfred). The rest are super light and easy to watch.

<TEXT> I don't think Watts' point was that the child should be allowed to jump in the puddle (obviously there are practical reasons to not allow them to, and the very next paragraph mentions this is a "completely understandable scenario"). I think Watts' point was that this *exemplifies* an early "divide" between social pressures and individual will. 

To clarify: The difference, for Watts, is when we become an adult and need to finally take responsibility for our choices. As he says in another quote in the article: "It is all very well to believe that, Mother is always right until you yourself are a mother.

Feel free to let me know where I might be wrong or if I'm misinterpreting Watts somewhere.

<TEXT> Not really. The question was specifically "In what cultures is it okay to cry in the office?" 

Based on what I've read in *The Culture Map*, Americans tend to be more emotionally expressive than the Swedish. I was actually expecting him to mention Russians, Italians, or some South American countries, which are even more emotionally expressive than Americans.

[Here's a good graph of how countries differ psychologically in business](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2015/11/R1512E_MEYER_COUNTERPART.png) (from *The Culture Map*)

The whole "How are you?" thing is definitely cultural, but it's a verbal formality more than anything else. Generally, Americans are actually more emotionally expressive than the Swedish in business settings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It in no way turns over the many, many larger studies showing the efficacy of combination CBT/pharmacotherapy.

Can you share some of these studies with me? I've seen a lot about CBT/medicine combo being effective for depression and other disorders, but not much about social anxiety specifically.

EDIT: I'm not trying to be obtuse, I'm genuinely curious of other studies about social anxiety and medication. I did a quick search right now for "social anxiety medication study" and came up with a [meta-analysis](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-03661470329-3/abstract) from 2014 that seems to support the study mentioned in the article:

Individual CBT (which other studies have shown to have a lower risk of side-effects than pharmacotherapy) is associated with large effect sizes. Thus, it should be regarded as the best intervention for the initial treatment of social anxiety disorder. For individuals who decline psychological intervention, SSRIs show the most consistent evidence of benefit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My opinion of course, but I have to disagree.

I think Aesop is a lot easier to listen to than most other rappers who are getting acclaim this year. He has a clear flow, he enunciates all of his words and is easy to understand, and his beats are fire. His lyrics can get weird and quirky, sure, but I think people can enjoy his lyricism just as much as any other rapper (if not more). He's intelligent and maybe artsy/pretentious-sounding for your average listener, but his name recognition is enough for me to think a lot of critics would eat this release up. 

**I'm just surprised he's not on a *single* list so far according to [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/feature/critics-pick-top-10-best-albums-of-2016).**

Counter-example: Danny Brown. I love him and I think his album is top 10, but he comes off way more inaccessible to me (and, I think, has less name recognition). His voice can be borderline irritating at times (for most people), the album was all over the place stylistically (I don't mind personally), and extremely weird. Yet, he's received a lot more attention from critics top 10 list.

I think the more likely reason Aesop is being over-looked this year is because his release was much earlier in the year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, but I would say most /r/hiphopheads and /r/indieheads would know him and love him - and this was a super solid release by him. Hell, Pitchfork gave this an 8.2 and it's nowhere to be found on their top 50. And not a single mention on any critics list according to [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/feature/critics-pick-top-10-best-albums-of-2016)? He's not *that* underground or niche. This is being looked over. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anywhere blacks are in the world, they end up having increased crime rates compared to the general population (for example, see [race and crime in UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_crime_in_the_United_Kingdom#Race_and_crime_in_London) - which has less of a history with oppressing blacks than the US). 

Don't get me wrong, poverty can certainly play a causal role (it certainly doesn't help), but it's not the *only* factor (and it could also be a symptom of other factors). IQ (and the heritability of IQ, which is established to be between 50-80%) also matters. Culture (especially one parent households, which is another correlative factor to poverty and crime) also matters.

There's actually a huge web of factors (likely both nature and nurture) that cause blacks to generally be more crime-ridden. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In truth, political polarity has been increasing since the Bush years and continued under Obama. Here's one [graph](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/09/17/opinion/17campstops-chart2/17campstops-chart2-blog480-v4.jpg) that shows "warmth toward other party" decreasing for awhile now. It's from Jonathan Haidt's recent keynote at APA called [What Is Happening To Our Country?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAE-gxKs6gM), which I highly highly recommend if you're serious about understanding the divisions in this country. </TEXT>

I really didn't care about going anywhere else with the interaction, I just wanted to overcome my fear of people. For that purpose, it worked - though I did get some weird stares and reactions when people realized what I was doing.

We are all at different points in our path of self improvement. Sometimes you just have to power through that awkwardness to overcome a hurdle.

<TEXT> Maybe narcissists are just more honest admitting they value physical attractiveness - which can be kind of taboo to say for more "polite" or "sensitive" people.

There's some evidence narcissists are fairly honest about what they think. For example, in one [study](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/socially-relevant/201601/how-profile-narcissist-one-simple-question), it was found that simply asking people "Are you a narcissist?" is a reliable way of determining if someone is a narcissist or not. 

Narcissists can be very transparent (especially about their opinions). They don't feel the need to hide themselves because they think they are the shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's true. The fantasies will often be better than the reality. That's one thing we need to look out for as well: [magical thinking](http://www.socialtransformation.us/social-anxiety/avoid-magical-thinking-relationships/) (which often increases the more distanced we are from someone). 

I know I've personally idealized a bunch of people inside my head, who then turn out to be nothing like I thought they would be in person.

Is it healthy to choose these "fantasies" over "real relationships" though? I'm not so sure about that.

<TEXT> Coincidentally, I did mention Kanye West as another example.

In regards to Trump, I can personally see it both ways. I think he truly says what's on his mind and he's taken a lot of criticism for it that he hasn't backed down from. That to me takes a tremendous amount of balls. I know if I was him and I was receiving the amount of media hate, I'd probably kill myself. It's like a teenager suffering from online bullying x 1000.

Sure, he fights back, which could be seen as "caring a lot what people think" but I also see it as another example of not being willing to take shit lying down. So I'll just have to agree to disagree with you on this one - but I totally see where you're coming from.

I knew the example of "Trump" would be divisive though. But then again so would Kanye West, who plenty of people hate as well. I think the "not caring what people think" attitude *always* creates both lovers and haters. It comes with the territory. 

Thanks for the comment. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those are completely valid concerns, but I think you're being overly critical.

Even just practicing your presentation out-loud in an empty room can help you become more comfortable with presenting the material and seeing how it flows. While we should be mindful of bias among friends/family, they can still provide useful feedback as well (especially if you actively encourage it - ask "What do you think I need to work on the most?").

I'm not sure what the alternative would be, rounding up a bunch of strangers? I test out jokes/stories all of the time among friends, even if it's just a casual setting like sitting at the bar or talking on the phone. I personally find it helps me perfect my story-telling ability. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely some truth to this. 

Democracy only works when choosing priorities among shared values. It doesnt work when there is an inherent conflict of values. If I start a book club, it makes perfect sense that we can vote each week on what book to read next. But if movie fanatics who dont read books start joining the club, out-numbering us, and then voting for movies instead of books - you have fundamentally changed the nature of the club. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're talking about the Reinhold study - it's just one study that didn't replicate. Cuddy has done dozens of studies and you can see her response to this study [here](http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/dana_carney/pdf_Summary_Expansiveness.pdf):

In this review we list the 33 published experiments based on 2,521 participants demonstrating the embodied effects of expansive versus contractive nonverbal postures. We discuss a new addition to this list that found an embodied effect of nonverbal expansiveness on self-reported feelings of power but no effect on risk-taking, cortisol, or testosterone. **Taken together, the body of work demonstrates support for the embodied effects of expansive nonverbal postures.** However, multiple experiments have found that the postural effects appear to be bounded by social context, culture, and participants awareness of the hypothesis. Fruitful avenues for future research are suggested. 

Also, considering the [facial feedback hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_feedback_hypothesis) is already a well-documented effect in psychology, I think it logically follows that a "body feedback hypothesis" would likely hold weight as well.

Of course, it's reasonable that only a single 2 minute "power pose" session would have a small (if any) effect, but an interesting future study would be to see how multiple sessions spread over an extended period of time (a couple months) would work. 

You wouldn't expect one dose of a medication to cure depression, so why would we expect one single power pose session to have a massive effect? I've been practicing power posing for several months now and I definitely feel a significant change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you feel negative that is what you will attract.

This isn't always true from my experience.

Sometimes when I let myself be negative and let myself digest negative feelings, they serve their purpose and I can more easily move on.

I can't imagine how depressed and trapped I'd be if I felt I had to fight every negative feeling I had.

Giving myself permission to feel negative sometimes was one of the most freeing things I've ever done.

<TEXT> Here is a short on how did I attract child abuse: https://youtu.be/C1f6jOxUYS8

That was a very underwhelming explanation to me.

"You were offering a vibration but you didn't realize it."

Really? The child was offering a negative vibration that led to them being abused? 

What about: sometimes bad things happen to good people that they don't deserve. The end.

Also, to the extent that "free will" exists, I think it's obvious that a child definitely has less choice than an adult does.

"We cannot say you're the creator of your reality sometimes and sometimes you're not."

Sure we can. In fact, the whole basis of the philosophy of stoicism is that *some* things are in your control and *some* things are not. Your power over your life doesn't have to be "black" or "white" (you are in complete control or you have no control). There are actually grey areas in life.

**To be clear: I do think some things in life ARE a "self-fulfilling prophecy" (and that idea can be very helpful). But the law of attraction definitely takes this belief to an extreme.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a final note I'd make here, in terms of the studies they've passed over, they have passed over a surprising number of studies written by economists of great repute -- for example, they skipped a positive pointing study by Giovanni Peri.

Yes, that study finds a correlation between ethnic diversity and economic growth in metropolitan areas - but it could very well be that growing economic areas attract ethnic diversity, and there's no causal relation at all.

Do you have any other studies that may have been missed in the podcast? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Functionally-speaking, why and how exactly should we suppose that these are different?

You can easily tease apart different intellectual backgrounds (biology, mathematics, psychology, engineering) vs. different ethnic backgrounds.

Here in Europe, "ethnic diversity" usually also has a strong linguistic component to it. Most of our ethnic minorities are also linguistic minorities. If nothing else, this implies that a more diverse work staff will be able to work in a broader range of languages (a skill which european employers put a very large premium on)!

Sure, but that's a problem that only arises in diverse populations in the first place. In a more homogeneous population, that extra demand for a diverse working staff wouldn't even exist. 

AFAIK, Groupthink is something that can be undermined and chipped away at by ALL kinds of diversity. 

According to the evidence presented here so far, that doesn't appear to be the case.

<TEXT> Also, if it's culturally biased (toward Westerners), why do East Asians always perform very highly?

The [Ravens Progressive Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices) is an IQ test that is generally considered the least amount of cultural bias because it's just recognizing visual patterns. 

You should try asking your question in /r/AskScience. I can't promise better answers, but I know anthropologists almost always underestimate biological factors and overestimate cultural factors. And the top comment here ("IQ has been thoroughly debunked") is flat-out wrong.

You might also be interested in checking out the book [Hive Mind: How Your Nations IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own ](http://amzn.to/2aoAosS). It's a great breakdown of various IQ research. It doesn't focus on "ethnicity" at all, but it does show differences between nations and how this can have influence on economics, governments, and other social institutions. </TEXT>

The logic is that wealth makes people more self-sufficient and less dependent, therefore there is less of a need for group cohesion.

<TEXT> "Borders are analogous to property lines. Both are arbitrary social constructs which exist only by convention. Both nevertheless exist because Darwin rewards people who practice their use. (And punishes those who do not.)

Property lines exist when individuals claim territory and succeed in defending it.

Borders exist when groups claim territory and succeed in defending it.

If property lines are the boundaries between property holdings, borders can be thought of as the boundaries between property regimes.

In practice, you have the property and property rights that the people around you are willing to concede that you have. One man cannot stand alone against the world.

But a few in confederation can hold the looting hoards at bay indefinitely.

Property and property rights are obtained in exchange. You recognize and uphold mine and I'll do the same for yours.

But to this basic condition, others can be added to protect the long term viability of the confederation which gives it force.

And first among these must be "don't let the looters in."

One condition people may demand for recognizing and upholding your private property is help in upholding shared borders.

You don't have to assent to that condition, but if not, you might find your position very lonely."

<TEXT> It's less than a standard deviation but sure, 2 points could be significant - we have a very large and diverse population. On average, however, we're certainly not the epitome of "stupid."

You can see countries ranked by IQ here: https://iq-research.info/en/page/average-iq-by-country

The site also offers a version of the Raven's Progressive Matrices here: https://iq-research.info/en

(It's considered one of the more "culturally fair" IQ tests since it's completely based on pattern recognition and no language/verbal questions.)

<TEXT> No. 

Ive been thinking about this a lot lately, so let me try to share my perspective as best as possible.

I find people who believe love is the solution to all of our problems show a sign of emotional immaturity. Its the same as thinking we should only experience happiness and never sadness. 

Ultimately, this is rooted in a fear of negative emotions.

Hate can be a productive emotion though. It means you know where your values are and you know when something stands against your values. Its the flip-side to love. You cant have one without the other.

And honestly, whenever I see people who say love is the solution to all of our problems they end up, upon closer inspection, to hate plenty of things.

I think the anti-Trump movement is one of the biggest current examples of this. Many of my friends say if only we loved everyone, but they also deep-down want to see Trump die. I certainly dont see them extending any of that love toward Trump. And thats fine, if youre being honest about your values and that not everyone shares them.

However, I would try to draw a distinction between hating people vs. hating ideas/behaviors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, I literally just finished Ryan Holiday's book "Ego is The Enemy" and it mentions this idea of an [imaginary audience](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/destroy-your-ego-before-it-destroys-you-and-how-we-make-bad-situations-even-worse). Check out the third section of my article:

As the psychologist David Elkind has famously researched, adolescence is marked by a phenomenon known now as imaginary audience. Consider a thirteen-year-old so embarrassed that he misses a week of class, positive that the entire school is thinking and murmuring about some tiny incident that in truth hardly anyone noticed. Or a teenage girl who spends three hours in front of the mirror each morning, as if shes about to go on stage. They do this because theyre convinced that their every move is being watched with rapt attention by the rest of the world. Even as adults, were susceptible to this fantasy during a harmless walk down the street. </TEXT>

It's likely you guys are already familiar with me as a moderator of /r/ZenHabits, /r/Psychology, and /r/Mindfulness. I also frequently share content from my website [The Emotion Machine](http://www.theemotionmachine.com), which nowadays is mostly reviews of various books in psychology and self improvement.

As far as my story, I'm a 27 year old male currently in New York (though I'm moving somewhere else soon). I worked at a music and arts venue in Brooklyn for a couple years, but mostly since college I've just been focusing on my own goals and eventually becoming self-employed.

But usually when we watch TV we get very absorbed in the characters and storyline, getting sucked up in the dialogue and emotions, and not exactly being "mindful" of what we're doing (sitting on a couch, watching TV, laughing at a joke). Instead, you think you're on a plane with snakes, or whatever - living in your imagination and not in the moment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He throws his primary base under the bus, knowing that they won't vote for Clinton regardless, and turns this election from a left-right conflict to a populist-establishment one.

He's already been making this pitch for a long time now. 

He calls himself a "commonsense conservative" (which I'm sure he'll drop in the general election), but he's made it clear he doesn't really care about the GOP or conservatism in general. He's already started positioning himself to the left of Hillary when it comes to war and foreign policy, and he's already taken a more "tolerant" stance on LGBT, planned parenthood, and other social issues compared to other conservatives who can't let that stuff go.

The "establishment" vs. "the people" theme has been with Trump's campaign since the onset. He's only played the card more as the GOP and media have treated him worse and worse. He even says nice things about Sanders getting screwed by the establishment.

In the primaries, he's already attracted a lot of moderates, independents, and Blue Dog Democrats. I imagine he will only double-down on those demographics once we hit the general election.

<TEXT> While I appreciate the "correlation isn't causation" sentiment. Some things to consider:

It could tell us that being psychopathic leads to being more creative, it could also mean that being more creative leads to greater psychopathy.

Of these two choices, which do you think is most likely?

It could also mean that both variables are caused by a range of other variables.

Sure. But do you have any in mind?

<TEXT> Yeah, I think "pathological altruism" may be an extreme form of "feel good altruism." Not being able to be satisfied with yourself unless you give, give, and give. 

The paradox is by never drawing boundaries or taking care of yourself, you often end up hurting both yourself and the very people (or animals) you're trying to help.

Animal hoarders are a common example of "pathological altruists." They can't say "no" to a wounded animal, so they end up taking in way more than they are capable of taking care of. As a result, it ends up creating an unhealthy and destructive environment for everyone. </TEXT>

Though they have very limited options - only about 5-7 charities listed. However, according to them, these charities do significantly more "good per buck" than your average charity.

I'm most interested to donate to GiveDirectly, because I think the potential economic and psychological impact could have a good multiplier effect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> None of the plans they've modeled has ever been implemented AFAIK

They can't apply their models to plans that are already in place?

Say they projected a 1% increase in growth but growth increased by only .5%, that doesn't necessarily mean they were wrong, because there could have been other factors that produced a .5% drag.

If there are other factors that influence the outcome you're trying to predict, then that's a weakness of your model.

<TEXT> "Hypersensitivity" might be a good term too.

But why is it not possible to be too attuned to others? If you are swept away in every person's emotions, that could cloud your judgment and become maladaptive. 

For example, it could mean you have trouble saying "no" to people, because you don't want to disappoint them or hurt them. Or it could mean you're compelled to help every single person you come across, which can lead to burnout and emotional fatigue. 

That's not empathy in the sense of just "understanding" people, but allowing everyone's emotional burden to become your emotional burden. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe it isn't the empathy that is the issue, but a failure to see the consequences of the actions they decided to use to fulfill that empathic urge.

What if the "empathic urge" *is* the reason you fail to see the long-term consequences of your actions. Intense emotions can often make it harder to think clearly and reason through our actions (think about the things you say when you're in a heated argument). If the "empathic urge" gets credit for sparking the good deeds, it should be equally responsible when it sparks the bad deeds.

I'm sure we have no problem admitting that "anger" - however natural and justified - can still be destructive in high doses. I don't see why we can't extend that same sense of balance to "empathy."

But I think we agree on one thing, which is most important: Reason is the intermediate factor here. </TEXT>

I think empathy is clearly a very valuable tool, but like all tools it can be misused and abused. Empathy without a leash can be unintentionally destructive and short-sighted, sometimes you actually need to curb your feelings and act from a more rational standpoint.

One thing to consider is that as groups get larger, you need to think about them in more abstract terms. When we talk about 320 million people in the United States, we can't possibly empathize with all those people (your brain can't possibly do it, ie "Dunbar's Number"). To make intelligent decisions about large groups of people, you often have to weigh statistics over feelings.

I'm sure there is a significant percentage of people here who also suffer from social anxiety, yes?

I understand what you're saying though. My friends are more narcissistic than the average person, but they are also smarter and more accomplished than the average person. They may not be your "typical" narcissist who is more impulsive or superficial. High IQ narcissists are probably more entertaining for me than low IQ narcissists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True. Narcissists think they are better than others. That can lead them to treat people poorly, but it can also motivate them to pursue goals that other people wouldn't normally think they are worthy of.

<TEXT> As someone who is fairly narcissistic and has a big ego (though probably doesn't have NPD), I can attest that I do like hanging out with other people who are narcissistic and have big egos.

The reason? I generally don't have to tip-toe around big egos. We both say whatever we want, we can tolerate arguing and debating, and there's less "beating around the bush" when it comes to sharing our thoughts and opinions.

In fact, I tend to admire my more narcissistic friends. They are generally more goal-oriented, ambitious, and confident - they are more likely to have drive and purpose.  And I'd rather be with someone like that than someone who is kind but spineless (and boring). </TEXT>

Another pet peeve of mine is when people outright dismiss sample sizes when it comes to fMRI studies, which are generally very expensive to conduct and that's why sample sizes tend to be smaller. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once an hour seems a little excessive to me, but if you are going to practice a [STOP Meditation](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/stop-daily-injections-of-mindfulness-1) the general protocol is:

**How to Practice STOP Meditation**

- STOP what youre doing.

- TAKE a few deep breaths, focusing on the sensations of your breathing. This helps reconnect you with the present moment and also creates a buffer between your thoughts and your actions.

- OBSERVE what is going on. Ask yourself:

 -What am I thinking?

 -What am I feeling?

 -What am I doing?

 -What are my intentions?

- PROCEED with your day with this new sense of mindful awareness (based on how you answered the questions above).

It's not complicated. Just a few seconds to step back, breathe, and reflect on what you're doing. 

After this short meditation, you may find that you should be doing something "better" with your time (for example, you caught yourself searching Facebook while at work) - or you may just proceed with exactly what you were doing before.

Hope this helps a bit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where these biases really come into play - and hurt the social sciences - is when it comes to seeking research grants on certain topics and getting published in peer reviewed journals when getting results that don't fit a certain narrative. That's why it matters that liberals make up 80-90% of the academics in social sciences. There's an inherit group bias there, especially in fields that are already very politically-motivated. (It's pretty ironic that the same people who preach skin-level diversity have such an intellectual monoculture, and don't see how their own biases have become systematic and self-reinforcing). We see this most notably in sociology, which consistently undermines biological influences and favors theories of social constructivism (essentially, as a rule). It's an actual problem. Diversity in ideas should be a primary goal at colleges. E.O. Wilson had the right idea bringing biology and evolutionary theory more into the social sciences, Steven Pinker has been carrying that torch now too, but there's still a lot more work to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This distinction is also why, as a former libertarian, I'm very sympathetic toward nationalism. 

I believe in the principle of *decentralization.* I have a strong individualist mentality (always have, it's in my biology), but I still see the value in siding with the local community over the state government, or the state government over the federal government, or the nation-state over globalism.

As groups get bigger, it's harder to manage them (see Hayek). There's a value in decentralizing power, the use of knowledge, and giving people the power to make decisions that affect them personally (or their "local sphere").

Applying this to nationalism, American people are allowed to side with themselves, they don't need to save the whole world.* This desire also brings out our imperialistic tendencies - it's why we make "bad deals" all over the world. But we are *allowed* to choose America over "world government." (and I don't mean that in a conspiratorial way)

Honestly, it comes down to respecting differences in how people govern themselves. Progressives are globalists though, they think their idea of "rights" is just true, and that's that. They can't recognize that other people may want to live under different moral codes.

*P.S. - We don't actually have the knowledge or capabilities to save the whole world. </TEXT>

 a person who you like and enjoy being with

<TEXT> Interestingly enough, James does argue in favor of a belief in "God" or "Oneness" from a pragmatic viewpoint (providing feelings of comfort and security), as long as the belief doesn't get in the way of pursuing other forms of truth. This is why one big component of pragmatism is the notion of "pluralistic truth." 

As a soft atheist, I've come to a similar conclusion myself. I think the concept of "God" *works* for some people, and there's nothing wrong with that, as long as it doesn't get in the way of understanding science, or other philosophies and scopes of truth, too.  </TEXT>

This is *exactly* why I started by asking you, "Where are you fighting against slavery?" I *realize* slavery still exists in parts of the world, but now we're getting somewhere more concrete than mere virtue signaling: boycotting the 2022 Olympics.

No, I don't believe it's "wrong." It's just kind-of pointless since the majority of people are disgusted by slavery already. It's not like you're really sticking your neck out to change public opinion. So I don't think it's a signal that really needs to be *boosted* in most of today's world.

Do you never indicate you favor certain ideas?

I do. I definitely signal, everyone does. And I'm certainly signaling right now.

But usually I signal when I have something unpopular that needs to be said, because I believe it needs to be said. I'm trying to *boost* signals that I feel need *boosting*. 

Signaling for obvious truths that literally everyone is taught non-stop in schools is not my idea of a good use of signaling. </TEXT>

For example, a "free market" that values science, technology, hard work, and education is going to look radically different than a "free market" that values nothing but drug abuse, sex, and temporary highs - even if in both cases all market actors are interacting voluntarily.

**Please note:** Before you jump the gun, I'm not saying "Use force on all the drug addicts and lock them up!" I'm saying, "Culture matters to markets, so shouldn't libertarians be more interested in spreading certain social values beyond *just* freedom?"

<TEXT> I'm definitely not denying the usefulness of skepticism or epistemology (or philosophy). I'm a habitual devil's advocate - I think strongly challenging and testing beliefs plays an important role in discovering where a belief fits in our "scope of truth." 

However, when I mention the Matrix, I'm thinking specifically about the [brain in a vat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat) problem ("We're all in a simulation!"). It's an interesting idea that plays off of an "obvious" truth (we can't step outside of our minds), but it doesn't provide much practical value beyond intellectual fancying (which is fine, but it's nothing more than that). I feel a similar way about David Chalmers [philosophical zombies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie) too. 

Don't get me wrong, I think thought experiments *can* be valuable (I like many of the ones Daniel Dennett describes in his book [Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking](http://amzn.to/1JQ4Kgr)), but they also have a tendency to come off more insightful than they really are. 

I recognize philosophy as very important and very practical to know (in general), but some philosophy is definitely *more* practical than others. That's the lesson I gain from pragmatism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Full disclosure: I wrote the article and I've always had an affinity for pragmatism.

I do think there are some limitations to pragmatism, however:

- According to James, if a belief makes us "feel good" it could be considered pragmatically valid. I'm generally OK with this, I don't get super upset if people believe in "God" or "Oneness" as long as it doesn't get in the way of them pursuing other truths.

- Technically, telling a lie may bring you a desired result, even though you are telling a lie. So if a parent tries their child's broccoli and says out-loud, "Mmm..this is really good!" - it is a subtle form of lying, even though it may eventually lead to the child eating their broccoli. The pragmatic value of "lying" is probably one of the better arguments against the truth of pragmatism.

However, overall I think pragmatism is a mindset we have to keep in mind whenever we philosophize. I don't mind diving into abstract ideas, thought experiments, and intellectual curiosities, but I think getting *too* caught up in these things without recognizing any practical consequences can be a trap.

Curious to hear your guys thoughts. This post got a little beat up on [/r/decidingtobebetter](https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3yxevz/when_philosophy_cant_be_applied_to_our_real_world/) and [/r/zenhabits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZenHabits/comments/3z2baq/when_philosophy_cant_be_applied_to_our_real_world/), though I think a big part of it is that I used a badly worded quote for the headline of the submission. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, thanks for the feedback, I will try my best to address some of your points.

It talks about how useless conjecturing about abstract ideas is as it conjectures about abstract ideas.

I don't think James (nor I) reject the use of abstract ideas. We just feel that, at the end of the day, those abstract ideas ultimately need to be recognized in concrete and experiential terms.

It also makes the assumption that unless we directly experience these 'real' benefits and identify them, they don't exist. Meaning in order to actually benefit from a thing you have to be conscious of the benefit it has on your life.

No, I don't assume that at all. I think most people aren't aware of the benefits (or costs) of their beliefs, except on maybe a surface level. 

Pragmatism certainly *recommends* trying to be more aware of the consequences of your beliefs, but it doesn't assume that is automatically the case. 

 I prefer to side with Kant on this topic wherein I believe that philosophy provides a mental model through which we experience the universe and make decisions. If you think about the human mind and thought in terms of an energetic system, it requires energy to make decisions, energy to apply judgements, energy to know which judgements to apply. Mental frameworks reduce this energy. You don't have to think about the afterlife if your framework has an answer for you. You don't have to go through the effort of finding out what the goal of existence is if your framework says there's no goal in existence. These frameworks make thought more efficient, giving us more energy to make more decisions.

I agree with all of this. 

Frameworks ("belief systems") provide utility, and yes, I think a big part of that utility is saving mental effort from having to consciously think out every situation we encounter in our lives. 

In general, we don't need our frameworks to be right all the time (they aren't, and probably never will be) - we just need them to be right *enough* to not cause us any serious problems. Most of the time, it's only when we get a real "shock" from life where we are motivated to change our existing framework in a big way. 

I'm not sure James' thoughts on Kant exactly.

Thanks for the reply. It's helping me think out these ideas more thoroughly.

<TEXT> No, I don't know quantum mechanics well at all. And neither do most people who use it to promote the "consciousness creates reality" idea.

What I do know - however - is that laws which are true at one scale of reality aren't necessarily true for other scales of reality. Newtonian mechanics is true for a lot of our everyday experiences, but those physical laws don't necessarily translate to quantum mechanics.

I find the idea that the behavior of particles is representative of the whole of reality tends to be an overly reductionist approach that ignores these different "scales" of reality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> William James would probably say perception and reality are interdependent.

It's true that your mind adds, subtracts, and distorts reality to fit a certain point-of-view. But it's also true that reality has a component that isn't completely subjective. We know this because we can observe the same phenomenon across different minds (gravity isn't a creation of your mind, everyone experiences it).

There was actually a relevant quote about this from James I was going to include in the article but didn't:

"Does the river make its banks, or do the banks make the river? Does a man walk with his right leg or with his left leg more essentially? Just as impossible may it be to separate the real from the human factors in the growth of our cognitive experience."

So this quote acknowledges that mind and matter are entangled phenomenon, but it does *not* imply that mind is the sole creator of reality. 

Buddhism has a similar view on interdependent origination.

<TEXT> This is a good point. William James actually does entertain the argument that beliefs in God or "Oneness" can be pragmatically valid because they make people "feel good." 

I guess the real kicker is getting lost in these abstractions when they *don't* make us feel good, but instead make us worry and endlessly contemplate. "Is there really a God?" / "Am I just living in a simulation?" / etc.

<TEXT> I know it's popular in some circles to hate Rand, but I stand by this choice wholeheartedly. I find there is a lot that is compatible between Rand's writings and self improvement. And in many ways her philosophy embodies the whole "man is his own hero" ideal. 

If you want a direct example of the connections between self help and Ayn Rand, check out the classic "Six Pillars of Self Esteem" by Nathaniel Branden, who was a long time associate of Rands and was very influenced by Objectivism.

I also recommend checking out Anthem before jumping to conclusions, it's only 50 pages. It's all about the dangers of conformity and celebrating mediocrity and ignorance (it takes place in a future "dark ages" where everyone uses candles and the protagonist rediscovers electricity).

Rand's not perfect, and say whatever you want about her politics, but not being able to see *any* connection between her ideas and self improvement sounds a bit shortsighted and dismissive to me. </TEXT>

You can be proud of things and enjoy people's success even though you didn't play a direct role in it, simply because you feel connected to them and you know them and you like to see them do well.

<TEXT> Their last album Sunbather was a big hit with the Pitchfork/hipster crowd, lots of people thought it was a unique blend of black metal/shoegaze/post-rock. 

I actually liked Sunbather too. Though the highlights for me were the post-rock interludes. </TEXT>

Basically, Trump is a symptom of a cultural war more-so than a political war - and that's a war that the left started. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's definitely not what I'm saying. It's still possible to do your own research and learn more about a subject through articles, books, documentaries, videos, etc.  You don't have to just take "science man" at his word. 

Dogmatism means believing in something without looking at the evidence. You don't have to be a scientist or expert to not be dogmatic, but you should actually care about the facts and not just regurgitate something because popular science guy on TV says so and that's that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't say "you have to read all the scientific studies." Of course it's perfectly reasonable to err with the experts when it comes to a subject you don't know much about. I don't have a problem with that.

However, the type of liberal I'm thinking about probably can't even name a single expert in climate science. All they do is "like" and "share" Neil Degrasse Tyson and Bill Nye quotes on the "I fucking love science" Facebook page. That's the extent of their scientific knowledge and activism. And, at its worst, they often do this with the attitude that they are so much "smarter" and "above" conservatives because they can science.

Every movement has its fair share of dummies, and every movement can become dogmatic on certain things. Yes, even liberals. 

(As a related side note, many environmentalists also dabble in the whole organic, gluten free, anti-GMO trends that are mostly bullshit. And the worst of them go into new age, crystal worship stuff.)

<TEXT> But "science says!" doesn't demonstrate an understanding of the facts. I've met many liberals who have never read a single study about climate change or looked at any numbers, they are merely relaying information from authority*. That's a type of dogmatism to me.

*To clarify further: It's one thing to side with the experts on a subject you know nothing about. It's another thing when you probably can't even name a single expert in that subject, and instead just "like" and "share" catchy Bill Nye quotes on the "I fucking love science" page.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found this bit particularly interesting:

What makes these violations of moral rules so instructive is how societies choose to deal with them. Ultimately, it all comes down to gossip. More than tool-making, art, or even language, gossip is a human universal that is a defining feature of our species (though this could change if we ever learn to translate the complex communication system in whales or dolphins). Gossip is intimately connected with the moral rules of a given society, and individuals gain or lose prestige in their group depending on how well they follow these rules. This formation of group opinion is something to be feared, particularly in small rural communities where ostracism or expulsion could mean death. Public opinion, facilitated by gossiping, always guides the bands decision process, Boehm writes, and fear of gossip all by itself serves as a preemptive social deterrent because most people are so sensitive about their reputations. A good reputation enhances the prestige of those individuals who engage in altruistic behavior, while marginalizing those with a bad reputation. Since prestige is intimately involved with how desirable a person is to the opposite sex, gossip serves as a positive selection pressure for enhancing traits associated with altruism. That is, being good can get you laid, and this will perpetuate your altruistic genes (or, at least, those genes that allow you to resist cheating other members of your group). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mindfulness is usually about focusing your awareness *toward a specific thing*.

For example, the most common exercise is "mindfulness of breathing" = just paying attention to the motions of your breathing. 

Sure, your mind *will* get distracted and drift toward other things. But the point is to catch yourself when you get distracted, take a mental note ("I got distracted"), then *refocus* your attention back to the object of meditation.

A great beginner exercise is to start with what I call the "[100 breaths meditation](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/100-breaths-meditation)."

(P.S. There's another form of meditation which I call [open mind meditation](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/open-mind-meditation) which is just watching whatever enters your consciousness, but this is a more advanced exercise.)

<TEXT> There are different types of meditation designed for different things. Here are a few of the main ones:

- **Mindfulness Meditation:** Cultivating awareness of the present moment through active focus and concentration (such as focusing on your breathing). This meditation can improve "mindfulness" of other daily activities, which is why mindfulness is a separate thing from "mindfulness meditation."

- **Contemplative Meditation:** Thinking/reflecting/contemplating ideas. This type of meditation is mostly verbal and not so much focused on cultivating awareness of the present (though you can be *mindful of thinking*, which is slightly different than *active contemplation*).

- **Metta Meditation ("Loving Kindness"):** Often this meditation is focused on repeating different types of mantras like "I wish all beings find happiness" or "I wish all beings become free from suffering" etc. It could also include elements of visualization (imagining the faces of people in your head as you repeat each mantra).

There are different types of mantra meditations and visualization meditations. Your "guided meditation for weight loss" is probably in this category ("visualize yourself eating less" or "tell yourself 'I don't need that piece of cake'"), and not necessarily related to cultivating mindfulness. 

I hope this clarified some things. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing I've slowly realized over the past few years is this: liberals aren't more tolerant than conservatives, they are just tolerant of different things. 

Jonathan Haidt's [The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided By Politics and Religion](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307455777/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8 camp=1789 creative=390957 creativeASIN=0307455777 linkCode=as2 tag=theemomac-20 linkId=OGAEFDIPREJ3HRP2) goes over this beautifully. He describes how everyone has their own moral impulses, and liberals and conservatives tend to get moral impulses from different "moral taste buds."

One example is while liberals have a moral taste bud for "equality" and "egalitarianism," conservatives have a moral taste bud for "authority" and "order." Neither is necessarily seen as right or wrong, it's a difference in *preferences* (or "moral tastes").

Haidt - a self-proclaimed progressive - does a great job at describing conservative morality in a non-biased way, and actually admits by the end of the book that he's learned that "liberal morality" doesn't always apply to all types of people and cultures.

Honestly, this book is *essential* reading if you want to become a more self-critical liberal or progressive. You can also get a good taste for some of his ideas in this lecture: [Why So Many Americans Don't Want Social Justice and Don't Trust Scientists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b86dzTFJbkc)

EDIT: Oh, and another related that is worth checking out: [I Can Tolerate Anything Except the Outgroup](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depression is an actual illness, not an event or state of mind.

Depression is definitely a real illness. But it's experienced moment-to-moment like everything else - and even as a depressed person you get your share of "ups" and "downs".

I don't mean to trivialize depression. I understand it can be a chronic illness for many and it never completely goes away. 

I do think it helps however to look at all of our passing "moods" (including "moods" experienced by someone with depression) as different phases that are always changing. </TEXT>

No single program explains immigrants' higher overall welfare use. For example, not counting subsidized school lunch, welfare use is still 46 percent for immigrants and 28 percent for natives. Not counting Medicaid, welfare use is 44 percent for immigrants and 26 percent for natives.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This quote couldn't be further from the truth. 

Republican rhetoric is often explicitly about economic issues rather than social issues ("cutting waste" + "tax breaks" are front and center on anyone's platform). The only reason they talk about social issues at all is because they are constantly being attacked from the left ("Republicans don't really care about minorities and women" is a common selling point for Democrats).

This is because Republicans are generally "out of touch" and unfavorable on social issues (they've already lost on gay marriage, and are losing on pro-choice). If they had their way, they would probably avoid talking about social issues entirely (especially race and gender).

EDIT: Is /r/worldpolitics not familiar with American politics? Or is reddit just really that knee-jerk "Bernie Sanders is right about literally everything."

<TEXT> Americans see themselves as temporarily inconvenienced millionaires. 

This is a very common phrase that originates from a [fake Steinbeck quote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck#Disputed). 

Unfortunately, most people even use this fake quote out of context. The original quote actually points out how most "socialists" / "communists" are privileged upper middle class:

"Except for the field organizers of strikes, who were pretty tough monkeys and devoted, most of the so-called Communists I met were middle-class, middle-aged people playing a game of dreams. I remember a woman in easy circumstances saying to another even more affluent: 'After the revolution even we will have more, won't we, dear?' Then there was another lover of proletarians who used to raise hell with Sunday picknickers on her property.

"I guess the trouble was that we didn't have any self-admitted proletarians. **Everyone was a temporarily embarrassed capitalist. Maybe the Communists so closely questioned by the investigation committees were a danger to America, but the ones I knewat least they claimed to be Communistscouldn't have disrupted a Sunday-school picnic. Besides they were too busy fighting among themselves.**" 

Ever since the Frankfurt school, most socialists realized that you could never bring socialism through revolution, because most people in America were just too wealthy and comfortable already. </TEXT>

I agree the trend to disprove free will is concerning, that's not what I intended when it comes to "Cognitive Agency." I just think it's misleading to say we have *complete* control over our thoughts. 

But at the end of the day, I'm a compatibilist. There's a way to acknowledge our limits of cognitive agency and square it with "free will" - I like the term [free won't](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/free-wont-why-you-shouldnt-take-any-single-thought-too-seriously). </TEXT>

<TEXT> All mental activity correlates with changes in the brain.* The article doesn't dispute that, so there is no need to evoke  mind/body dualism.

The point being made isn't a metaphysical one, but an epidemiological one. While genes and biology can influence the onset of many disorders, it's also true that psychological, social, and environmental factors can influence the onset of disorders too.

For example, "addiction" - while some people can be more biologically prone to it than others - is largely a "learned disorder." It's often caused and perpetuated by your childhood, your habits, and your environment. Ignoring these factors is going to make it hard to treat the disorder.

<TEXT> The existence of a claim can not be used as evidence of the claim being made. Me saying "I own a dragon" is not evidence that I own a dragon.

Testimonial evidence is weak evidence, but it is evidence. Certainly with an extraordinary claim like "I own a dragon," it doesn't hold much weight.

However, when people tell me "I have a dog," I usually assume they are telling me the truth, but that's not as wild of a claim so it's easy to take that "weak evidence" and assume it's true. 

Testimonials are certainly considered evidence in court. But yes, they are incredibly prone to error - which is why skepticism, interrogating, and cross-examination are needed to. The same could be said about the role of testimonials in science.

(The statement "I have a dog" mixed with the knowledge that 1. Dogs exist, and 2. People commonly own dogs as pets, makes the testimonial fairly trustworthy. Unless the person is a pathological liar, it's safe to say they are being honest.)

Stories at face value can be very misleading. But I believe stories corroborated with other evidence can add something to the pool of understanding.

<TEXT> Yeah, the "anti-anecdote" part seems to be the one that most people have a problem with.

I totally understand that personal observations are biased and the whole point of science is to protect against these biases. That's basic philosophy of science to me. I get it.

However, I don't see this as a reason to dismiss all anecdotes at face value. So often people tell about their own experiences with depression, anxiety, or mental illnesses and people just dismiss it as, "Well, that's just anecdotal evidence."

Yes, it's true that anecdotes are not as robust of observations as measurements and statistics. They certainly could never *replace* or *invalidate* a scientific study. For example, I hate when people respond to a study and say, "Well I'm X, and Y isn't true for me! Therefore this study is wrong!" That's not what I mean here. 

**However, I think people's personal experiences can *add* to scientific research. Especially when personal experiences *fit* with statistical data, it can often give us a little more context. We get a chance to see how certain principles "play out in the real world." And that can be insightful.**

I wish I could give a specific example.  But consider Daniel Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow" or any good book on psychology. Yes there are studies, and statistics, and theoretical concepts. But there are also many *stories* that elucidate those scientific principles. 

It's one thing to know what the "planning fallacy" is, it's another thing to hear some examples of the way it can manifest itself. Like when Kahneman talks about him and his team overestimating how quickly they could finish a new textbook. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree wholeheartedly. 

I think your sleeping schedule should fit your biology and personality. "Night owls" and "early birds" are sleep preferences that are at least partly influenced by genetics (actually some [research](http://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/youve-heard-of-owls-and-larks-now-sleep.html) shows there 4 different sleep chronotypes).

Also, even as an early bird myself who likes to be productive in the morning, I naturally wake up around 7-8am. 

There's no reason for me to *force* myself to wake up earlier, I get plenty of waking hours throughout the day and I get within the recommended range of sleep hours. 

I remember having to wake up at 6am for school and it was awful for me. I hated needing an alarm and not waking up naturally. Just being forced to wake up 1.5 hours before my "natural" wake up time through me completely off for the rest of the day. I never really adapted to it during my school days.

Now I've been sleeping without an alarm or forced sleep schedule for years now, and it's become a very natural and steady pattern (typically go to bed at 11pm-12am on weekdays and wake up between 730am-830am). My sleep patterns have never been healthier.

If waking up at 5am works for you, great. But I think people's sleep schedules should ideally be shaped by individual differences and preferences. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really like this idea! So often we try to fill that "emptiness" with something meaningful, but that can become a trap.

<TEXT> Yes. I think it's also insightful to watch physical pain too - even just a small ache, or soreness, or itch. 

Mindfulness can show you how "impermanent" the sensation is. The sensation changes as you watch it - it intensifies, it decays, it changes shape, it comes back in waves, and sometimes it just disappears.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think half of being mindful is just knowing when I'm being distracted.

Sometimes it helps to just step back for a second and ask:

- What am I *trying* to do?
- What am I *actually* doing?

If those things are disconnected, then I need to go back to the present moment.

For example,

- "What am I *trying* to do?" I'm at work and should be focusing on writing this new article. 
- "What am I *actually* doing?" I'm writing a comment on reddit.

Conclusion? Back to focusing on work.

Thanks for the distraction. Bye. :)

<TEXT> It's difficult. Not impossible. 

Just one anecdotal example, but I used to have a huge fear of flying as a kid. Then when I learned I was engaging in availability bias (it's easier for me to remember a tragic plane crash than a car crash), and found out that statistically planes are actually much safer than cars, my fear had gradually faded away.

I don't know if that's the case for all biases. But I do know some biases can be overcome with the right information and right attitude. Now I don't think "identifying the bias" is the *only* thing you need to do - our minds are a little stickier than that - but it's a good first step.

In general, people change their beliefs all the time. It may not be as common as we'd like, but it happens. People here who identify as "skeptics" are probably more open to this than others. Can you think of anytime you changed your mind about something? I bet you can. </TEXT>

It's definitely true that wrong information can "stick" in our brains even if we are exposed to information that contradicts it. 

If these beliefs are ideological-based (politics/religion), some studies even show beliefs become *stickier* when presented with contradicting evidence (we cling to them harder, sometimes called [the backfire effect](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/)).

As you say, confirmation bias is definitely a big influence here. We tend to focus on information that confirms our beliefs, and ignore information that doesn't.

Another probable influence is [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring): If your first experience hearing about X is learning Y, then that initial knowledge is going to make it harder to integrate new information about X that may not fit Y. This is the closest term I can think of for what you are describing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All participants chose from a fixed set of traits selected by a US researcher. This is already a source of bias.

Do you have any specific criticism of the sampling? Or do you just really want this study to be misleading and wrong?

Looking at different cultures tells you nothing about whether these cultures represent a good sample of Homo sapiens (potential) diversity or not.

It's not perfect. But a sampling of different cultures is *better* than a sampling of one culture if you want to find something generalizable to homo sapiens. 

Yes, we can talk about self-report bias, sampling bias, stereotype threat, and all of these potential flaws of the study. No single study is going to be perfect. No single study is going to represent a completely "objective picture." And culture, in part, will always play some role in people's attitudes.

But answer me this: what criteria would convince you that these differences in sexual attitudes are (at least in part) innate or biologically influenced?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Part 2 on Cultural Evolution](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/08/cultural-evolution-2-thanks-for-the-meme-rise/) is worth checking out too:

Cultural evolution can happen when one group in a society outbreeds another. The Amish population has increased twenty times faster than the non-Amish American population in the past century. At a constant growth rate, itll be only another four hundred years or so before America is an Amish-majority nation. More seriously, some people expect something like this to happen with high-fertility-rate immigrant populations, like Latinos and Muslims. In cases of strong differential fertility rates, cultural evolution becomes a race to see if the faster-growing minority can reproduce faster than the majority can assimilate them. However, despite dire predictions of all of us being crushed under the Amishs quaint hand-made boots, people had trouble thinking of historical examples of something like this happening. Sure, populations have replaced other populations  like the Anglo-Saxons replacing the Celts in England  but its tended to occur alongside military invasions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many phobias are learned too, that doesn't mean they aren't real mental disorders. 

Just because the brain is plastic doesn't mean that it always changes in adaptive ways, sometimes it changes in maladaptive ways. PTSD is one of the most extreme examples of this, and I'd doubt you'd consider that not a real disorder.

The article kinda falls into a "biological trap." Most psychologists recognize that mental disorders can be caused by a variety of biological, social, environmental, and psychological factors. This is why the proper term is "disorder," not "disease." 

"Disease" is a semantic trick here. It implies that all mental disorders have to be rooted in purely bottom-up biological causes. Which isn't true. And most psychologists understand this.

General rule of thumb: "A neuroscientist says..." articles are typically unsubstantiated bullshit. Just because one professional thinks X doesn't mean it's true. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Between 2001-2011 there were roughly 176k homicides, and 88k black victims, 80k white victims. White people are not dying at ten times the rate of black people.

But 50% of those homicides were committed by blacks, even though they make up 15% of the population. And an overwhelming majority of those black victims had black perpetrators.

Blacks in America disproportionately kill compared to whites. Fact.

Now we can most certainly mention that poverty is a big influence here - and more blacks suffer from poverty and dismal circumstances that push them to murder and crime. The War on Drugs is also a big influence here, as people in poverty tend to get pushed into the black market where many disputes end up being settled through violence.

But why do you have to twist every fact to fit one narrative? Why can't you accept a piece of evidence as is - even if it doesn't tell the whole story? (and no single fact tells the whole story) 

I agree the article oversteps by saying this is proof that the "racism narrative is false," but it still brings up some relevant evidence that I think we should be willing to accept and talk about, not just try and explain away.

When I first saw these statistics, I was very surprised. I think most people would be. The news puts a huge emphasis on white on black crime, and I would've never guessed that blacks actually commit a disproportionate amount of overall homicides.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Your position that an attack on and seizure of a military fort by an organized army is not an act of war is patently absurd.

The fort was barely functional as is and no one even died in the attack. It's obvious that the US didn't think the secession was legitimate, but secession isn't an act of war in-itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Although it wasn't ordered by Lincoln, a U.S. Army Major sent troops down to Fort Sumter days *after* the secession. That alone can be considered an act of aggression.

2. Confederates demanded a surrender of the fort (since they were seceding and didn't feel comfortable with union troops around) *before* they initiated attacking. 

3. It takes more than "first shots" to start and continue one of the bloodiest wars in America's history. Lincoln was persistent that his goal was to preserve the union at all costs.

Well to be fair, the infographic doesn't mention online "brain training games" per se. "New environments" and "learning a new language" are *pretty good* research-supported recommendations for improving (or at least maintaining) cognitive ability. I think the key is to keep your mind stimulated with new things. Doing sudokus everyday probably isn't going to cut it.

I do agree however that "neuroplasticity" is essentially a buzzword. Every new habit is going to change your brain in some way, and it's not necessarily a good thing.

<TEXT> I'll share my comment from /r/zenhabits here too:

Yes, I think meaning and purpose are important.

I first noticed this when I became an atheist as a young teen. Like many newborn atheists, I fell into a "nihilistic trap." If life is just nature, evolution, and random chaos, how can it have any intrinsic meaning? Surely, any meaning we do find in the madness is all "make believe?"

Needless to say, this perspective made me very depressed. I felt like a meaningless cog in a wheel, without any real control over my life or what happens to me. Life is what it is and I'm just a passive observer.

My problem was I was looking for meaning "out there." I wanted an answer to life, the universe, to God - and all the big ideas that are seemingly ungraspable.  

But what I should've been doing was looking for meaning "in here." What's meaningful *to me*? Meaning is an inherently subjective and contextual thing. 

Now when I think about meaning, I always remind myself to ask, "Meaningful to who?" 

Meaning is a product of consciousness. That doesn't mean it isn't a "real" thing though. It took me awhile to make it over that hurtle in my thinking.

In general, I think a sense of meaning and purpose are a great buffer against daily stress, and this is why they are associated with both physical and mental benefits. 

**Having a sense of purpose reminds you that you're contributing to a "bigger picture" (your family, your relationships, your work, your community). It reminds you that you're *not* just a passive observer, but an active participant in this world - even if it's only within your small sphere of influence.**

A friend of mine recently said, Nihilism is one infinitesimal grain away from being true, but that grain makes all the difference. I believe that grain represents our own daily choices and actions, and the small influence they have on the world we live in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One way I try to "learn" from the psychopathic mentality is by watching good TV and movies that portray highly functional psychopaths.

For example, I love watching scenes with characters like Walter White, Hannibal, or Frank Underwood. Their ability to keep their cool in high risk situations, their social charm and rapport building, and their clever, off-the-cuff thinking when met with unexpected challenges are - by themselves - really interesting traits that I think we all wish we had.

Am I saying I like meth dealers, cannibals, and corrupt murderous politicians? Of course not! I don't think finding something good about a person means I think they are a perfect moral human beings.

(I also understand that fictional psychopaths aren't the best examples of average psychopaths. But that doesn't really matter to me, I'm trying to dissect characteristics I admire in other people, fiction or not). </TEXT>

EDIT: No, my interpretation isn't "contradicted" by the actual conclusions (and TheEmphaticPotato even agrees it's "true to a degree").

<TEXT> I think a big reason for the growth of NRx is also the rise of left libertarianism, especially the spreading of feminism and multiculturalism into American libertarian/anarchocapitalist rhetoric. 

There seems to be an unquestioned consensus that free markets and libertarian economics will naturally serve progressive values. But that's not necessarily the case - and that's not necessarily a bad thing either.

Unfettered markets lead to unequal outcomes. And that's something that left libertarians are having trouble coming to terms with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, as a basic rule of thumb, I consider all psychological traits as on a spectrum. [Trait theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_theory) is actually one of the more dominant theories in personality psychology these days.

If you can conceive of autism on a spectrum, with "functional" on one end and "nonfunctional" on the other, I don't see why a similar spectrum can't be applied to psychopathy.

To be clear: saying that there are "functional psychopaths" doesn't downplay the seriousness of "criminal psychopaths" anymore than saying that there are "functional autistics" downplays the seriousness of "nonfunctional autistics." </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you take the assumption that our society is well-designed and functions well then your position makes sense.

No, my belief doesn't require that assumption. Mostly because I don't hold it. 

Like all people, I think society could be better. But functional psychopaths running society is nothing new, and it's not merely a byproduct of current systems.

**My aim is *understanding* why people in power are in power, not *justifying* it. I think this is important to understand because if you want to change society, you need to first know how power is created and maintained (at both an individual + group level).**

For example, I wonder how Bernie Sanders or Rand Paul would rank on the psychopathy scale. Though they are individuals who want to "change society for the better" - in their own different ways - they are also supremely focused, ambitious, non-conforming, and have the social skills and social charm to gain significant followers.

<TEXT> Now that I've written that, I do think the idea of sociopathy as a spectrum is interesting, but is this current psychiatric theory? I had always read you either are one or you aren't, and to talk of non-sociopaths as having similar traits of sociopaths is to confound the idea of a sociopath.

There are indeed psychologists who conceive of "psychopathy" as a personality trait that lies on a spectrum. And there are tests designed to measure these traits in a normal, non-clinical population. See: [Psychopathic Personality Inventory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathic_Personality_Inventory)

<TEXT> "Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand." - Homer Simpson

There's interesting evidence in the book that psychopaths can be very good at empathizing, they just don't sympathize. This is what is meant by "cold empathy" vs. "warm empathy."

One study showed psychopaths are better at picking up microexpressions. Another study showed psychopaths are especially good at picking up on other people's negative emotions (like fear).

Empathy (and "emotional intelligence") are just tools for understanding others. They don't automatically lead to moral behaviors. One interesting article on this idea is: [The Dark Side of Emotional Intelligence](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-emotional-intelligence/282720/)

Psychopaths, believe it or not, can be incredibly emotionally intelligent. That's a big reason they can be so manipulative and persuasive.

<TEXT> *To elaborate, I have a strong bias against sociology.

Clearly. And I totally understand that bias - it's a good heuristic - but I feel like you're kneejerking a bit here, maybe falling trap to your own "memeplex." (ie: social sciences = progressive propaganda)

For starters, you're never going to be able to study society in the form of "controlled experiments." The best we can do is collect social data and try to find patterns and draw inferences based on that. There's always going to be some level of interpretation. And no study is going to paint the full picture.

Sociology is particularly bad not because of the social data collected, but the narrative they constantly form around it. Specifically, they favor evidence that fits one narrative, and are against evidence that goes against that narrative. 

As you mentioned, this study doesn't explicitly say what I am suggesting it says ("Ethnic cohesion = healthy"). If it did, it probably wouldn't have been published. That's part of the sociological bias.

However, I do think one task of NRx is to take social sciences and re-interpret them.

We're rarely going to see a psychology or sociology study that explicitly points toward a NRx idea. But the truth is: a lot of the data doesn't fit the progressive narrative, and we need to highlight that when we can. </TEXT>

Assuming the sample is representative of the population, you can generalize the results to "Detroit." That's how science tends to work. If you think the sample is not representative, at least explain why.


Don't wed yourself to this study just because it confirms your preconceived worldview. It is a common temptation, but junk science is junk science.

Yes, that's why I said "in Detroit" - where whites are a minority.

Blacks showed no difference in telomere length between poor and non-poor samples. And for the Mexican group, those in poverty were more likely to be immigrants or maintain ties to their Mexican heritage, such as speaking Spanish at home, which the paper theorizes is why telomere lengths were actually *longer* in poor vs. non-poor Mexican samples.

These results, to me, hint at the importance of social identity and ethnic cohesion when it comes to health and community. Albeit, it's just one small finding.   </TEXT>

I've already submitted two of his campaign memes to /r/badeconomics ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/37cqjh/bernie_sanders_condemns_existence_of_23_different/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/369wde/bernie_sanders_do_you_even_diamondwater_paradox/)). It could've been a lot more.

Even if you agree with his policies and his general sentiment to "cut down on corruption," you can't deny that his economic reasoning is a lot of empty populist platitudes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Typical Sanders zero-sum game economics. He effectively believes that having a lot of consumer options when it comes to deodorant or shoes *is* a reason people are still poor. 

Honestly, it's irrelevant how you think wealth should be distributed if you don't care how it's created in the first place. And Sanders really doesn't care how wealth is created. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugh. If that's true, how do you explain black markets?

Agreed. You can argue that laissez-faire capitalism needs to be reigned in by the state, but there's no doubt that markets are a fairly natural consequence of human interaction. If you put a large group of people with different interests together, and violence is kept in check, you're going to get some form of a marketplace.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the passage for those interested. It does include a study in addition to the speculation, but it's hard to say for sure without measuring suicidal intent while the attempt is happening (which is obviously hard to do):

But its also true, in most Western countries, that more women attempt suicide than men. One reason a higher number of males actually die is their choice of method. While men tend toward hanging or guns, women more often reach for pills. Martin Seager, a clinical psychologist and consultant to the Samaritans, believes this fact demonstrates that men have greater suicidal intent. The method reflects the psychology, he says. **Daniel Freeman, of the University of Oxfords department of psychiatry, has pointed to a study of 4,415 patients who had been at hospital following an episode of self-harm; it found significantly higher suicidal intent in the men than the women. But the hypothesis remains largely un-investigated. I dont think its been shown definitively at all, he says. But then it would be incredibly difficult to show.**

<TEXT> I'm confused. Do you think conservatives are against food security, parental education level, school quality, or the ability of parents to provide enriching activities outside of school? This sounds more like economic disagreements, not psychological ones.

Conservatives talk frequently of the influence of traditions and cultural values - they most certainly acknowledge that outside forces play a role in social outcomes. Most of them aren't nearly as "rugged individualist" as they pretend to be - they are cultural warriors coming from a different point-of-view.

First, it's true that conservatives tend to *overestimate* the role of personal responsibility, but that doesn't mean that it plays no role - or that people are completely powerless over their circumstances. There are other factors that correlate to success too: willpower, grit, delayed gratification, growth mindset, etc.

Second, "personal responsibility" isn't the only socially conservative value. They also tend to value things like "hierarchy," "authority," "family," and "sanctity" - and in certain contexts, these aren't necessarily bad social values (again, see Haidt's "The Righteous Mind").

Hell, even as an atheist, I have to admit religion has shown to be beneficial toward psychological and community well-being. And that's something that tends to be a conservative talking point.

Critical thinking tip: If you think someone has absolutely nothing to offer to a conversation, you're probably the one who is biased.

<TEXT> I'd wager it's because it's very hard to remain a conservative once you know what social psychologists know. Not without an enormous cognitive dissonance.

Do you have any examples in mind? 

Also, have you read Jonathan Haidt's "The Righteous Mind?" Because even as a staunch progressive he has some really great psychology-based criticisms against certain liberal values and in favor of certain conservative values.

<TEXT> Evolutionary psychology is definitely filled with a lot of speculation. It's hard for it not to be. We're in a vastly different environment today than our ancestors were, but that doesn't mean evolutionary instincts don't play out in new ways (Or even, that culture itself isn't a byproduct of evolutionary tendencies).

Unfortunately, I feel like a lot of people take this "all evolutionary psychology is speculation" and then conclude, "ergo it's all socialization." And that to me is just as bad of a reach.

Sometimes, I really just want to grab people, shake them, and say:

- "Dear feminists, evolution plays a role in human behavior!"

- "Dear evolutionary psychologists, culture plays a role in human behavior!"

I thought the nature-nurture debate was "settled," and we agreed it was a mixture of both. But it seems whenever we start talking about gender than the shit throwing comes back between both sides.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Diamond Water Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_value)

The paradox of value (also known as the diamondwater paradox) is the apparent contradiction that, although water is on the whole more useful, in terms of survival, than diamonds, diamonds command a higher price in the market. 

Basically, just because X is being sold at a higher price than Y, doesn't mean society thinks X is inherently more important than Y. Prices are influenced by many factors (including supply and demand), not just raw perception of "value." It's like thinking water should be sold for a million dollars per bottle because it's *so* important and essential to life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree I would like to see specific citations of studies, but it appears the article is based on the book [Warriors and Worriers: A Survival of the Sexes](http://amzn.to/1cDIhbY) by psychology professor Joyce F. Benenson. 

On the page, the book also has an endorsement by E.O. Wilson, who isn't exactly a no-name when it comes the intersections of biology and sociology.

It's not controversial that men have more testosterone than women. And there are a slew of studies that show how testosterone is linked to higher risk-taking. Here's [one](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/10/financial-risk-taking-behavior-is-associated-with-higher-testosterone/) when it comes to financial decisions. 

In general, I think these biological differences do have some say in the economic differences between men and women, though certainly society and culture have an influence too. 

I like to just play it safe and say it's "50/50" when it comes to nature/nurture, but depending on your field there tends to be a bias (feminism = bias toward cultural factors, evolutionary psychology = bias toward biological factors). </TEXT>

For those that may not know, this is often the reasoning behind the "dodo bird verdict" - the idea that most therapeutic models are equal, and instead there are [common factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_factors_theory) at work behind all therapies that make them effective.

I think there is a lot of truth behind this. It doesn't matter how effective the model is if you don't really care about the well-being of your client and don't truly listen to them. At the same time, I think psychologists can use the tools of CBT, DBT, and psychodynamic therapy (all "evidence-based") to help improve their practice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   In that context, the re-appropriation of black art often ends up diluting the impact of the original work because it has been co-opted by a far larger group, in this case it's white people who benefit the most from this system.

Please. These are just people making harmless covers on YouTube. No one is really "benefiting" from covering an acoustic version of a rap song. They certainly aren't taking any money from the original rap artists, or stealing fame, or diluting the original work (not anymore than any other cover is).

On top of that, I'm always very skeptical of claims of "cultural appropriation." Where is the line between borrowing from other cultures and appropriation? From my experience, it almost always comes down to arbitrary and subjective tastes - and the end-result is just restricting the free flow of ideas.

Hip hop especially borrows from ALL sorts of cultures, including European cultures (sampling classical pieces, pop songs, etc.) Afrika Bambataa's infamous "Planet Rock" sampled both Kraftwerk (Germany) and Yellow Magic Orchestra (Japan). Hip hop is one of the most "appropriating" forms of art out there. But that's also why it's so diverse and awesome.

<TEXT> I get why people think this is silly (and Jezebel seemed to have a field day over this), but there are countless studies that show children who grow up in single parent households do worse than children who grow up with both parents. This is especially a problem in black communities, where single parent households are statistically way more common. It's definitely a factor in what keeps blacks in perpetual poverty and crime, though it usually means more when it comes from within the black community. 

EDIT: As far as bringing in Rand's personal history, it shouldn't take away from the overall message. And anyone who is being honest knows a few parent mishaps isn't nearly as bad as a child literally never seeing their father, ever. All things considered, the Rand family is doing quite well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I'm the author of the article. You're right that a lot of this advice doesn't help with people with personality disorders. My sister has an extreme version of BPD (throws tantrums, breaks stuff, threatens to kill, etc.). 

There are unfortunately not many easy answers for dealing with these types of people, but I've been trying to keep the "silence or violence" in mind - and the second I notice signs, I step back. At the very least those signs may be a good indicator when to just walk away. But yeah, not a cure-all. I'm just trying to improve how I interact with her in anyway. 

It's hard for me *not* to go into my own version of "silence or violence" around her, so at the very least maybe I can control that better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. That's also why there is a difference between saying "Gamers are sexist" vs. "Sexists use video games to be sexist."

Perceived anonymity, lack of consequences, high arousal state - all of those conditions make video games a particularly "good" place for sexists to be sexists. That can make sexism seem prevalent among gamers even if it's only being committed by a loud minority.

It states that ~40% of children born at the very bottom will stay there, and ~40% at the very top will stay there. That's of course a significant influence, but that still means the *majority* of children born at the very top and the very bottom won't stay there into adulthood.

This policy came to public attention in March 2013 when Smith rejected the application of a trans woman named Calliope Wong.

It's pretty easy to square it if you know where he's coming from. 

Rand supported the Civil Rights Act sections on prohibiting forced segregation by government (Jim Crow laws), but disagreed with it in one section: private business are allowed to discriminate, based on property rights.

You don't have to agree with that, but it's not hard to see where he is coming from, especially from a libertarian viewpoint.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the study:

These statements were based on those utilised in the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) (Raskin   Hall, 1979). The NPI is a viable tool for the measurement of the general construct of narcissism and is the most common measure of narcissism validated for use with nonclinical populations (John and Robins, 1994 and Raskin and Terry, 1988). 

Don't forget that narcissism is also measured as a personality trait. This doesn't mean that women prefer men who literally have Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

makes it sound like some moronic red piller saw a study he didn't understand and wanted to write about it...

The study itself uses the word "narcissism." This isn't a "red piller" interpreting a study to fit what he wants. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's a personal criticism of one of Haidt's points.

At the end of the book, Haidt acknowledges the "miraculous" effects of free markets, while at the same time acknowledging that some government is necessary to suppress the "superorganism" of corporations from becoming too powerful.

A few things he doesn't consider: 

- There's no "superorganism" greater than government. If corporations need to be kept on a leash by government, what must exist to keep government on a leash? I assume he'll say something about democracy here.

- The "superorganism" of most corporations is actually a mixture between big business and government. So it's erroneous to think of these superorganisms as *solely* a product of the market. Haidt actually acknowledges how corporations "capture" government regulations (but doesn't consider that it's the regulatory process itself that allows "regulatory capture" to happen in the first place).

- Who is to say businesses that are a product of the free market couldn't be better, more adaptive superorganisms than government? Why does government inherently have to be the biggest "superorganism?"
