<TEXT> I'm sorry to hear that. I can't defend the actions of every Muslim community. Islam doesn't tell us to harm or take advantage of people just because they aren't Muslim. Muslims have a higher percentage of violent extremists today, but that has more to do with the political    social context the Muslims are in today. There is also a strong correlation with poverty and certain crimes. Even looking back 25 years ago, it wasn't this bad in several Muslim countries.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was a Shia cleric. If i remember correctly, the Orlando attacker was Sunni and had some communication with Isis before the attack. I'm pretty sure the attacker wasn't attending a Shia mosque.  Also, the Shia cleric was mentioning capital punishment that was applied historically in certain Muslim lands for the sin of sodomy. I have yet to find a single Muslim group in America that is openly enforcing capital punishment or demanding capital punishment to be done to gay Americans.

 That's simply not true, from what we know of Orlando and San Bernardino.

It's inconclusive whether anyone from the San Bernardino shooter's family knew beforehand of the attack. The wife of Orlando shooter knew he was going to do something a few hours before. Check the Boston bombers or several other attackers. It's rare for the family to know about it, if anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In his sermon/lecture in the YouTube audio below, Qadhi begins by calling Christians shirk for being polythesists who believe in the Triune God (three persons in one God), instead of Islams monotheist god Allah.

Muslims believe in strict monotheism. Worshiping other deities is not allowed in Islam.  Obviously that would mean Muslims therefore believe other religions that encourage polytheism to be wrong. I'm not sure why you think this is so surprising. Muslims don't worship other than the Abrahamic God; what Muslims however reject is the concept of Trinity. Can Muslims still live with Christians and other religious groups in peace? Absolutely yes.

 Qadhi declares that the prophet Mohammad  and by extension all Muslims  has been commanded to do jihad.

Yasir Qadhi clarified and said "*This audio clip is a shoddy cut-and-paste job from a lengthy theological series (around 15 hours of audio) I gave many years ago, discussing the reality of the Islamic concept of shirk (associating partners with Allh). The series had absolutely nothing to do with politics or jihad. Rather, some theological statements from that lecture have been taped together and made to look political. The audio recording as it stands is a complete distortion. Someone literally took sentences from different parts of that series and constructed a very menacing sounding paragraph in my voice. As such, that paragraph in the audio clip is a complete fabrication.[ ] I am a Muslim theologian and teach (and preach) the theology of Islam, but I have never called for violence against any group or religion*".   

It's important to watch the full speech, not a segment of few seconds.  [Here's a uncut lecture  of Yasir Qadhi explicitly condemning terrorism.](https://youtu.be/3y8i3hVtUYw?t=1m55s) He also explains some factors that lead to such groups and how to combat against them.

[Another lecture, talks about his beliefs regarding Jihad, monotheism, etc INSIDE A CHURCH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=updtj99Fp80).

<TEXT> American Muslim here. I've been to several mosques, attended various Islamic programs here in America.  Mosques in America don't radicalize young people, the few individuals who do end up becoming terrorists are often loners, young ~20 year old men who are sometimes influenced by online foreign recruiters if anything. Even their own families don't know about their extremist views until it's too late.  The thought that some mosques are secretly plotting, grooming or even sympathizing with terrorists just doesn't happen, at least not in this country.

<TEXT> Summary:

 Local business owner, Mike Hager flies to Iraq to bring his mother back home to the US for medical treatment. But under President Trump's ban on immigration, he was forced to leave his family behind.  Hager said he didn't expect it to be a problem for the family to travel since they all had green cards and had lived in the United States for 20 years.  

 "I was just shocked. I had to put my mom back on the wheelchair and take her back and call the ambulance and she was very very upset. She knew right there if we send her back to the hospital she's going to pass away - she's not going to make it," Hager said.

<TEXT> **Aboubaker Thabti (44):**
Born in Tunisia, Mr Thabti is reported to have moved to Quebec a decade ago and worked in a pharmacy. He was married with two young children, his brother said "He's so kind; everyone loves him - everyone."

**Azzedine Soufiane (57) :**
Born in Morocco and settled in Quebec three decades ago. He ran a grocery store in the suburb of Sainte-Foy. Mr Soufiane had helped many newcomers in Quebec City. "When I arrived here eight years ago, [his shop] was the first place I learned about and pretty much all of Quebec's Muslims did their groceries there," Mr Elabed told Canadian media.


**Khaled Belkacemi (60)**: 
Mr Belkacemi studied chemical engineering in his native Algeria before moving to Canada in the 1980s. He taught food at Quebec's Laval University and was married to a fellow professor there. 
He is described as "an extraordinary person" who was "always smiling" and "an outstanding teacher who loved his graduate students". He has 3 children.

**Abdelkrim Hassane (41):**
Studied information technology in Algeria before emigrating. A colleague said Mr Hassane had lived in Paris and Montreal before settling in Quebec City.
Mr Hassane worked in IT for the Quebec government. The colleague, Abderrezak Redouane, said he was "a very peaceful, sensitive man". He had three children.

**Brothers Mamadou Tanou Barry (42) and Ibrahima Barry (39):**  Both were born in Guinea in West Africa. They are described as IT workers. Mamadou Tanou was a father of two and was reportedly sending money home to Guinea. "Tanou lost his father three years ago, so it became his responsibility to support not only his family here but also his family in Africa. Now that's all been cut," a family friend told the Globe and Mail. Ibrahima worked for the province's health-insurance agency and had four children.

<TEXT> Are you denying that people experience species dysphoria?  There are many other psychological phenomenon i could have brought up. And i've come across the studies about brain structure of transgendered people before. If i remember correctly, it was basically some brain similarities among transgendered people which was very flimsy evidence anyway. And this isn't hard science, since psychological phenomenon can't objectively be measured. This is why we will never have an   objective way to determine gender based on measuring brain structure.  But you bring up another interesting point. When transgendered people refer to themselves as a gender different to their biological sex, and more to how they feel or more closer to the gender role they associate in society (as another commenter also pointed out) then they are just reinforcing gender stereotypes.  Are transgendered people in favor of reinforcing stereotypes? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Gender identity is why a transgender person is a transgender person. They identify with a gender that is different from the one they were assigned at birth. Regardless of how they were raised, regardless of how they might individually perform or not-perform their gender or how they might conform or not-conform to either socially constructed gender role, they still identify with a specific gender.

By doing this, aren't transgendered people then just helping maintain gender stereotypes? And i still don't see your point is. What's the big deal if people are misgendered then? Perhaps you can give me another example, because i still don't get the significance of what you're saying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is only hard-science behind biological sex, which is why we use it to designate living things as male and female. There can be no hard measurable science behind social constructs, such as gender (using the definition of gender defined above).  Gender dysphoria is one of many psychological phenomenon. There is also such a thing as species dysphoria, but that of course doesn't make the person experiencing to be a different species, and it doesn't mean we should start referring to people as different species. </TEXT>

   If you're a dude but for some reason for your entire life everyone has referred to you as a girl and woman, this wouldn't be very fun for you.

Your example doesn't work. If i was born a biological male and was referred to as a girl or woman my entire life, then i would be perfectly fine with it because that's the social construct i'm growing up with. I would feel exactly the same way as i do today where a person is referred to as a boy or a man if their biological sex is male. </TEXT>

Muslims in America are commonly lower-middle class citizens, pay their taxes, follow the laws and tolerate people of different faiths and lifestyles (of course, there will always be a few exceptions). I lived in NYC most of my life; the city is very diverse and every ethnic group brings a bit of their own culture and own lifestyle when they come to this country and i don't see how any of this is a problem as long as they follow the laws. That's what makes the city beautiful.  To me, these immigrants have assimilated and integrated just fine. The crimes people often associate with migrants (like rape and theft) are just crimes more commonly done by people living in poverty.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Snopes is a fact-checking website. Even if you disagree with it, you can just check the sources. Or you could have ignored the entire article and read the rest of the points i mentioned and Google what i said for yourself.

And why trust Eva Bartlett? I already pointed out how she says misleading things.  The Syrian government only allows independent journalists who spew their propaganda to go there, or else they will kick them out. https://www.cpj.org/2016/12/swedish-journalist-expelled-from-syria.php.  Because if you haven't realized yet, there is war propaganda being used to tell people that Assad is beating all the evil people and "liberating" the innocent people of Syria (who were actually supporting him all along).  I could show you an independent journalist who visited the rebel side who reports of Bashar's crimes. Would you accept that? probably not.

There are many Syrian people who have left and spoke out against Bashar, there are also family members of Syrians living in other countries who have spoken out. There are also several people who were on Bashar's forces but the deserted the army because they didn't want to kill innocent people. You can read all these accounts and more online.

Kim Jong Un also won with 100% of the vote, That doesn't mean it was a fair election. It takes common-sense to realize that you cannot have a fair election when there is a civil war going on, and you only count votes from particular regions that support Assad that the government has control over.

 You need to cite your source for the claim that "much of the country hated him".

Google it for yourself. If i cite any source, you'll likely just reject that too. I mean you rejected a fact-checking website, so i don't know what you accept.  There were mass protests against Assad in 2011-2012. One protest in particular, in April 2011 in Homs had ~100,000 people.  Many of Bashar's followers are Alawites (religion), and they were the minority in Syria. Most of those who opposed Bashar were Sunni Muslims and they made up [almost 75% of Syria.](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2006/71432.htm)  </TEXT>

She is also a contributor at RT, a news site funded by the Russian government. She makes a number of mistakes including her claim of Al-Quds Hospital never being bombed. She also misleadingly states that Assad won democratically. Assad has been president for 16 years straight.  In 2000, Bashar won with 99.7% of the votes. He was the only candidate and Political opposition to the president was not allowed. The 2014 Syrian election could only be held in areas that were pro-Assad due to civil war. Rebel-held areas as well as Kurdish areas and others were deprived of the vote. 88.7% of the people able to vote in 2014 voted for Assad. The second-place finisher was a puppet opposition that fell apart right after the election. You can't really expect to have a fair election in middle of a civil war anyway. Contrary to what you might, much of the country hated him. There were large protests against him during 2011 which Bashar responded to very harshly eventually leading to a civil war.  A common point of criticism Assad/Putin  supporters like her make is that supporting the rebels is supporting terrorists. This is a really weak point because anyone who fights against the Syrian state is a terrorist by definition. No one is calling Bashar and Putin as 'terrorists' because they are state leaders, despite all the deaths they are responsible for. Yes, there is an al-qaeda presence as well, but there are various other groups.  For many of the rebel fighters, this is their first war that they are participating in.  Nearly half million have died, millions more have migrated and [Aleppo right now is under siege.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-un.html) These are facts, that some pro-Assad/Putin supporters act like is not even happening.

<TEXT> Yeah i don't know what the solution is either, and it all depends on what sources you trust.  If you think American news is bad, take a look at RT news on the Syrian civil war. They aren't just biased, they have a clear agenda where Putin   Assad cannot be blamed for the war despite the deaths of hundreds of thousands. And it makes sense since to Russia to show only one side of the war since they are more involved in this war than any Western country. 

Just want to point out, that woman doesn't represent Canada's view. She's speaking at a pro-Syrian government event. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The name of the journalist is Eva Bartlett.  [She was refuted by snopes.](http://www.snopes.com/syrian-war-victims-are-being-recycled-and-al-quds-hospital-was-never-bombed/) She's a pro-Assad journalist and was speaking in that video at a pro-Syrian government event.  She is also a contributor at RT, a news site funded by the Russian government. She makes a number of mistakes including her claim of Al Quds Hospital never being bombed. She also misleadingly states that Assad won democratically. The 2014 Syrian election was only held in areas under government control. Rebel-held areas as well as Kurdish areas and others were deprived of the vote. 88.7% of the people able to vote in 2014 voted for Assad. The second-place finisher was a puppet opposition that fell apart right after the election. 

A common point of criticism Assad supporters make is that supporting the rebels is supporting terrorists. This is a really weak point because anyone who fights against the Syrian state can be considered a terrorist by definition. No one is calling Bashar and Putin as 'terrorists' because they are state leaders. Yes, there is an al-qaeda presence as well, but there are various other groups and al-qaeda was never a monolithic group like Isis.  For many of the rebel fighters, this is their first war that they are participating in.  </TEXT>

If you watch the news about the war on Russia TV, it's like you're seeing a completely different war than what's shown on almost all other international stations.


Unfortunately our conversations on reddit about the Syrian war have become really watered-down. *"But they are terrorists! and they have Al-Qaeda on their side!"* The rebel forces have various armed-groups on their side, and saying that they are "terrorists" is meaningless here, because anyone who fights against the Syrian state can be considered a terrorist by definition.  For many of the rebels, this is their first time participating in a war. </TEXT>

 The assault took place on Monday morning as the victim, 45, was heading to work on the subway, CBS New York reported. The suspect followed her off the train and shoved her down the stairs, police said.
 
 Sources told CBS New York the suspect allegedly called the victim a terrorist and said she shouldnt be working in the city. She was wearing a Muslim head covering at the time of the assault, and was treated at a Manhattan hospital for ankle and knee injuries. 
 
 Authorities say a good Samaritan intervened, and police are looking for the man who committed the crime.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I meant that it's not realistic to have Muslims who are fully engaged in such a weekly program.  Imagine if it was just 1 full $50 day course with a scholar.  You are more likely to attract Muslims who are more engaged, more interested, more involved with the course and with each other. Spending time with such a gathering has much benefit, and you get much more out of it than just going over some material that you could get from reading class notes or watching a video.  If you can do this in your local area with a local scholar, even better.

<TEXT> If you can get a group of passionate Muslims to learn together and teach each other for a significant amount of time, than that's great. I just don't see it as something practical.  We even have for example, a weekly group-watch of Yasir Qadhi's Seerah series on r/Islam. It started out with plenty of people interested to try this, but it's slowed down quite quickly, because most people were just able to follow  along. It's not that Muslims on this sub aren't interested in learning, it's that we have our own schedule and watching a video series wouldn't make it that much of a priority, especially when we could be doing other things more beneficial.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In reality, I've found there to be Muslims wanting to improve themselves and increase their knowledge in every community I've lived in.

I don't disagree with this. But to have a setup similar to a free intensive class on your own, and have online videos in replace of a teachers; i think it would be hard to have everyone organized that way and i don't think you would get  the same atmosphere. I mean, i'm interested in learning but i would be much less interested if you don't have a knowledgeable teacher to teach the course.  I've participated in several Islamic classes and programs, some of which were free. And i think i benefited most from the classes/programs that were the most expensive and most structured. And i found students who were more passionate to learn in those classes.


But like i said, i can't speak for this program. Never been to it. But i really don't see the cost of a class as a reason why one shouldn't attend (unless one doesn't have the money). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sadly we have a large number of Muslims who think Islamic teachers and scholars don't deserve money for teaching or that they should get the bare minimum. They rely on money just like everyone else. Institutions also need money to provide their resources, accommodate students and provide new programs that other people can benefit from.  Now we have so many mosques that rely on fundraisers and desperate pleas, because people don't want to pay for anything non-secular.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't speak for this intensive program, but i was in some other similar (but shorter) programs which i was really grateful for and i believe i benefited immensely from those types of programs. I watch many lectures online too, but getting involved in these programs is nothing like watching YouTube videos.  You get so much more from sitting with knowledgeable Muslims and scholars.

  Get together with fellow Muslims in your community and have a group watch + discussion and food every Friday evening. Make it a potluck. Invest in your local community, build those bonds of real brotherhood and sisterhood.

You do this and you'll likely get a lot of Muslims who aren't interested or be temporarily involved. The type of atmosphere that you're looking for (ambitious Muslims eager to learn and share ilm) would actually be in those types of programs. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Ruqyah sessions can go for no charge up to 1000 per session. Let me tell you there are a lot of Muslims willing to part with their money if they feel jinns, sihr and other things are involved in their lives.

How many Imams have you honestly seen making even close to that much money doing Ruqyah? This is not something most Imams would do or be able to make enough from.

 As for conferences organisers pay for accommodation, travel and small expenses for those who participate. It's very lucrative especially imams who are scholars as they can fly abroad to give talks.

Again, this is not something doable for the most Imams. It usually works for a few well-known Muslim speakers, and even then they get criticized for "making money from Islam". If we need someone to spend 30-40 hours a week in the masjid, provide 10-20 hours a week of counseling, and on top of that be constantly on-call for marriages, funerals, and other emergencies, then a pay structure should be built to reflect that.  </TEXT>

None of which are lucrative enough, and the Muslims who do those, still get criticized for "making money from Islam".

 Some imams get no salary, others rely on donations.

Which is a big problem.

<TEXT>  But surely that only applies to your own religion.

Every religion has their own sources.  As far as i know, all Ahmadis accept Tadhkirah and accept the words of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.  If they don't, they can correct me and i'll accept my mistake. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Ahmadiyya group makes an effort to interpret Islam to appeal to the opinions of modern society and to progressive values.  So far example, they will denounce all Jihad and commonly quote "Love for All, Hatred for None" even though Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote a lot of hateful stuff about the Christian community during his time. They will also interpret Quran ayat very differently and ignore all hadith which goes against their beliefs.  What they also don't tell you is all the bizarre things their prophet has said. [Here are some quotes from just one book.](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1vltgo/some_questions_for_the_ahmadiyya_community/)

<TEXT> I'm not saying that you shouldn't post these type of news stories here, but that you should accompany these stories with ways for us to help the people as well or at least find some way to do  something productive about it.

It can be counterproductive to post emotional incidents like this repeatedly and give no avenue for people to do anything about it. I'm not talking about this story in particular, but when you have stories of oppression repeatedly shown to people, then this can cause people to become depressed or enraged, which is not good. This is also how some people fall into extremism, justifying harming other innocent people on the opposing side.   </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-07-02 21:39:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm noticing 2 common types of news topics posted in this sub, but they often go without any benefit: 

1. "Muslim victim" articles

2. "Muslim did something wrong" articles

Regarding the first category, Muslims are oppressed every single day all over the world. So why post specific incidents of Muslims getting hurt in this sub? How about we do something about it instead of getting angry and emotional over it?  If the incident is local, try to see if you can do something beneficial about it, perhaps contact the media, proper authorities, or Muslims groups. Do what you can do in your area to prevent such things from happening again. Muslims already know about the oppression we go through, but non-Muslims may not know about it. So post the story to /r/worldnews  or /r/news  or other subs so that non-Muslims can also be aware of the level of Islamophobia that's going on, or try to raise awareness in some other way.

For the second category, it can be important to address news articles that are popular in current events in which Muslims engaged in some bad activity. We can explain how the action of the perpetrator is against Islam in a clear and precise manner. If this is common mistake done by Muslims, then we can discuss on how to prevent it from happening again. Sometimes we also have be careful not to jump to conclusions and backbite, keeping in mind that it's very possible that important details might have been left out and that we don't know the full story.

My point is that we should be productive about our posts, rather than simply react and be emotional about it. Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Uhh ok. Because "go and" makes all the difference when it comes to "kill ahmadis", a group which has been killed time and time again without justice being met.

It didn't say to "kill ahmadis" either. The only thing the leaflet commanded was to not socialize with Ahmadi's (which i don't support). It's just another exaggeration by these Ahmadiyya articles to say that the leaflets were commanding Muslims to go and kill Ahmadis.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In that case, then the original article is just as baseless because it comes from an anti-Ahmadi guy.

Anyone who disagrees with Ahmadiyya or talks about how it's wrong is labeled "anti-ahmadiyya". This is how my questions were first dismissed when i asked at /r/ahmadiyya and my posts were removed. 

 Additionally, Akber's statements in this article are alarming because he said that there is nothing illegal in a leaflet that clearly says, "kill Ahmadis".

And he's right. Not that i agree with the leaflets, but it doesn't say that you should "go and kill ahmadis".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're posting from an ahmadi-apologist news source which predictably uses the same rhetoric to dismiss any fault from the Ahmadiyya leadership.   It even starts off in their first point with a typical character-assassination attack, to weaken Akber Chaudry's point. The author is supposedly linked to Khatme Nabuwwat which supposedly sent out a "go out and kill Ahmadis" leaflet, which wasn't even true.

<TEXT> Thanks for the link.

 Alas, our simple Muslim brethren! Now what are the obligations  your, mine and that of every Muslim? What does our honour demand? It demands at least to have faith in the truth of Islamic Shariats decree on this issue, viz., capital punishment for an apostate and dualist-infidel. But it is up to the Government to respond to the Shariats call. However, this much is within our reach that we cut off all social connections with them and dont let them enter our gatherings and face them boldly everywhere.

 There is a lot of things you can call capital punishment for but I was looking for text that explicitly tells Muslims to go out and kill ahmadis which is what one article seems to suggest. This just says to cut off social connections from them.

Do you consider Islam to be suppressed in Saudi Arabia? And what do you suppose we do about countries where Islam is suppressed.

 Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Turkey, are all places where Islam has been suppressed during different times. Egypt, Algeria, and Turkey had coups because of that very reason.

I think that was only part of the reason why the uprisings occurred. And it's not like those countries are doing much better now. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   Even if it is a mistake in interpretation by a lunatic (or many groups of lunatics), a perfect text would acknowledge and account for this risk. That's if it's a mistake, these radical Islamist groups seem to have no trouble finding Surah and Hadith that unambiguously justify their actions. What's so hard to get about this?


I've researched a lot about terrorist groups and i can tell you that it's not as simple as "the religion says we should do it, therefore we should do it", there is almost always a large political motivating factor as well, but i don't want to go into yet another side topic and talk about terrorism now. 

I don't agree with your opinion however, that a religious scripture (or any text at all) should be blamed because of someone's misinterpretation. You can misinterpret even the most simplest sentences. I can interpret your comment as a physical threat to me and call the FBI and tell them you want me dead.  You however will not be charged with a crime, because my misinterpretation alone does not put you at fault. 

 Alright, let's ignore new issues, 

lol then please stop bringing up new issues like the narration about killing apostates which Muslims don't consider authentic anyway. It just makes me question your intention and where you learned about Islam. I ignored the rest of your comment which lead into tangents.

 It is dishonest to make somebody believe something that isn't true. You can make someone believe something that isn't true by saying something untrue- let's call that a lie.

Let me clarify further: A lie is **saying something untrue**.
For example, if i pretend like i'm struggling trying to carry a box and throw it to my friend, when it's actually just a empty box. I did not lie, unless if i were to verbally mention that "the box is heavy". You could say that i "mislead" my friend or i "tricked" my friend.  Or even "deceived" my friend, (although personally i use the word "deceive" if you are intending to cause harm).  Can you give an example related to the original context (New Muslim convert) that fits under the definition of a lie? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Sounds like it's already a moot point. So claiming to be of any religion is pretty pointless, as it's basically meaningless?

I gave you a clear example twice already. Someone can claim to be of a religion (Muslim, Christian, Jew, etc) and we can accept them as such, but that doesn't mean all their actions are favored by their own religion. What's so hard to get about this? 


 What the translation 'literally' says (barring that there's something lost in translation, which is possible) is that 'those different from you' are universally described as having 'hatred already appeared from their mouths.'

No it doesn't. No Muslim i know would ever make a silly mistake like that. If you started from the beginning of the Quran and sequentially when upto chapter 3:118, then you should know that that's not how the Quran describes those who aren't Muslims. Not even close.

 By which you mean, read it after growing up in a culture shaped by it and having your sense of community and belonging depend on your accepting it?

Everyone has to watch out for being biased. What religion did you grow up in?

 Soooooooo.... it's only perfect if you're trying to convince yourself it's perfect?

I basically said the opposite; that you should NOT hold biases like this.  And you continue to misinterpret not only the Quran, but most of what i said throughout this entire conversation. The fact that it took me nearly 10 responses to explain to you how /r/islam wasn't "*explicitly condoning lying about religion*" says a lot, and i'm still not sure if you accepted your mistake on that issue. Also i  don't see why you keep bringing up new issues when you can't agree with what i said before. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I appreciate your sentiment, but you basically just said that every Islamic terrorist group counts as being Islamic.

I was trying to explain that there is a difference between Islam and Muslim.  Muslims can do actions that are against Islam, just like Christians can do actions that are against the teachings of Christianity. Being a Muslim doesn't mean that all of your actions will be Islamic. I can consider someone a Muslim if they say the declaration faith, but that doesn't necessarily mean that doesn't i accept their actions or say that all their actions are Islamic. 

 It's easy to say that 3;118 only counts for people whom "hatred has already appeared from their mouths,"

Because that's literally what the translation says.  As mentioned earlier, any sentence in any language can be misinterpreted or misunderstood. You're basically questioning the essence of communication   language. Or are you asking why can't God just said us revelation that we could all understand without effort? Or even better, why can't God just make us all believe in Him? If He wanted to, He could have made us all accept Him but this is not part of God's plan.

I would say that a good portion of the Quran, especially the main themes of the Quran, are clear. But if you want to understand the Quran, then you have to be sincere and fair with yourself. And put aside any preconceived notions or any bias prejudices you may have while you read. It helps to understand the Quran if you read in sequential order, (even better would be to read in the original language), and if you have trouble, you can ask someone more knowledgeable for clarification or check a commentary of the Quran.  If you are reading the Quran with the intent of finding flaws and mistakes, then that's what you will likely see in the Quran, (the same can be said about reading any book). You need to come with the proper intent/purpose. So why are you interested in reading the Quran? What do you hope to get out of it? </TEXT>

<TEXT>   But, there is a difference between someone believing something false about you as a result of miscommunication or innocent assumption, and believing something false about you because you're intentionally trying to make them believe something false about you- that's the line between misunderstanding and dishonesty.

But since you can never know the other person's intention, you can never know for sure if a person is intentionally trying to make you believe something false or if it's just a misunderstanding. I could assume you're lying and there would be no way for you to prove to me that you weren't anymore. You could try to explain, but i could always assume that to be lie too or just part of another lie. That's not even how we typically use the word "lie" in common vernacular today.

 Creating a false belief in others without actually speaking a falsehood is just something really skillful liars do to protect themselves while still deceiving.

They aren't lying if they aren't speaking falsehoods. And i wouldn't say it's creating false beliefs in others, it's more like ignoring to answer questions or changing the subject. Like if someone asked me if i was a Muslim, and i chose to not answer. Then that's not a lie, regardless of the other person's interpretation, and regardless of me wanting to keep it a secret.

 "Just be quiet and you'll be safe." That attitude is the brick and mortar of tyrants. Or, would you argue that Islamic theocracies never abuse the power they get from forbidding criticism? 

I would say it's allowed to talk in private but usually just public declaration of blasphemous speech is forbidden. And yes, of course  there are some Muslims who have abused this rule and forbid any criticism or hurt people unjustly. Muslims should be open to intellectual criticism, IMO.

 Honestly, I'm in favor of prison reform, and I think public lashing needs more consideration as an alternative to incarceration.

Some countries like Turkey do go with the prison route instead.

 Okay, this is gonna sound pretty meta, but... how can you tell if you're a Muslim? Any discussion of Islam's problems will prompt a chorus of how the offending party is "not really Muslim," which proves that it's possible to follow Islam and believe the teachings and consider yourself Muslim and yet you are "not really Muslim."

It's not really about who is or isn't Muslim, it's about what actions are and aren't Islamic. For some reason many people believe that if someone is a Muslim, then all of their actions must be Islamic, which is not true. The average Christian commits many sins according to their own religion and even Christian priests make mistakes, sometimes big ones, so why assume Muslims are all perfect in their religion? If someone says they are Muslim, than i'll accept them as a Muslim by default.

  Quran 3;118 seems pretty clear in saying that "real Muslims" aren't allowed to have kaffir friends, so a non-Muslim pretending to be Muslim around Muslims is about as Muslim pretending to be non-Muslim with his non-Muslim friends. After all, you can never know for sure what their real intention was.

Of course we can have friends who are non-Muslims, we can even marry certain non-Muslims. I don't know of any notable Muslim scholar who has said that we cant be friends with non-Muslims. 3:118 is talking about not being intimate with those whom "hatred has already appeared from their mouths", more can be said from this from the context. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You could, although it would be the result of innocent misunderstanding, as I have not been intentionally convincing you to have an untrue belief, whether by speech or lack thereof.

Well that's part of the problem. I could assume you're lying and you could say it was never your intention. But i can never know for sure what your real intentions was. I could also assume that you lied about your "real attention".  

 Cool! I just got my first Kindle, this'll be a great way to try it out!
Thanks for taking the time to speak with me, this is very informative!

Glad to hear it, i hope you get something out of it.

 Afterthought; Are you allowed to lie about not being Muslim? I know many Islamic countries have a death penalty for apostasy, so if you were raised in Islam and stopped believing, you could die if anyone found out.

The death penalty that happens today is exaggerated IMO. True, certain Muslims countries say they have the death penalty for apostasy but it's actually more about freedom of speech than disbelieving. You are not allowed to say blasphemous speech in public, like saying "Islam is wrong/evil", etc. I've been to a couple of Muslim countries, and i can tell you that there are many people there including Saudi Arabia, that don't believe in Islam, but they won't be executed or face any punishment or anything. Unless they were to, for example, make a public rant on the internet about how bad Islam is or something. Then they might be flogged or lashed, but even that may not always be as harsh as it sounds. [Public lashing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYS_nduLkdU).

  If you're allowed to lie about being Muslim for your own safety, is the reverse true?

It would be irrelevant, since you already aren't a Muslim, why would the rules of Islam matter to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Khalid Yasin is NOT talking about isis. That's why i said to talk about general rules and not real world, because he isn't talking about any Muslim group attacking. ISIS didn't even establish their caliphate until after this speech was made...

Muslims =/= ISIS. ISIS is just one Muslim group that is fighting other Muslim groups. Why are you putting all Muslims together with ISIS? Why not put all the Muslims together with any of the Muslim groups ISIS is fighting against? Either case would be wrong.  It's like me lumping all Christians together with the Army of God (Christian group which uses violence to fight abortion).

 Generalizations only work until it comes to the real world and you learn that generalizations don't work.

General rules do work but only when you apply them properly.

 Perhaps Yasin doesn't understand the broadness of what he is conveying to all these people, however if just one person in the audience took what he is saying as a green light to attack the USA or Germany or the UK it is one too many.

It's not the speaker's fault for your misinterpretation.  It's like me interpreting your comment to mean that it's fine to attack Muslims, but it's never fine for Muslims to fight back. That would be really messed up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well i gave you a dictionary definition of lying. If you define "lie" to mean something else, then go ahead. But Islam does not permit lying according to the definition i gave ("saying something incorrect").  So if someone were to ask me if i was a Muslim and i don't respond, then that's not a lie using the definition i gave. 

The problem with your definition is that it leads to interpretive problems (which i think you hate). If i assume your a Christian this whole time, and you are an atheist, then i can claim that you lied to me. You deceived me by not being open to me about your lack of faith. You could claim that you weren't trying to act Christian, but i could claim the opposite and there is no objective measure that we both could agree on to always determine who in fact is right here.

 Can you recommend some? From what I've seen, most of Islamic history is an expansion of conquest and subjugation that makes the British Empire look like the Salvation Army.

More like the opposite. Here's a highly recommended biography:

Lying is a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood, for simplicity i would consider it a "false statement". Choosing not to talk about a subject is NOT lying about it.  You don't have to "lie by omission", you just don't have to talk about it. Also, "lying by omission" is not necessarily a lie depending on the example.   

 I know almost no Islamic history

And you've already made plenty of wrong assumptions. I suggest learning from Islamic sources if you're interested. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Given the low threshold by which muslims in western nations will claim persecution, that's basically saying they'll lie whenever.

lol, you're trying to hard to avoid the fact that you were wrong. Ironically you're the one lying here. 
You said *"most of the people in the thread were explicitly condoning lying about religion for convenience"*. Cmon, you should be able to admit that you were wrong here, I mean you can check the topic again for yourself when the proof is right in that topic.  I only see 2 comments that mention lying, one which mentioned "significant persecution" and the other mentioned "Moors during the Spanish Inquisition".  Yes, sometimes Muslims do go through severe persecution for their beliefs. It happens.  We don't know what OP's situation exactly is. Please be honest and fair.


 there's nothing in the Ayah about what they 'really believe,' only what they say. 

In the Arabic, Inna (Indeed) is used to emphasize something for confirmation. And it wouldn't make sense to refer to Muslims as "shaitain".
I just found out that another Muslim corrected you on these same verses and said basically the same thing as me. It's very clear from the Arabic, and even the English translation with context, that it's talking about people pretending to be Muslims, and not the other way around.

 A perfect text can be translated without needing to interpret it or make assumptions about what the author intended to say.

This is the issue with any language or with any text. Any sentence can be interpreted differently.

No, those verses are only talking about ~~Muslims pretending to be non-Muslims~~ non-Muslims pretending to be Muslims, not the other way around.   *but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say: "We are really with you: We (were) only jesting."* - this is talking about the hypocrites pretending to be Muslims. When they go back to their own group of  evil ones, they admit what they really believe.  It doesn't make sense if it was the other way around.

The Muslim community that is being addressed can be divided into two: those who believe, and those who are pretending to believe, the latter being discussed here. Also like i said, Islam doesn't allow lying so you can't lie and say that you don't believe (except for in rare circumstances like persecution according to some scholars). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Astronomer here!  A lot of ELI5 requests on gravitational waves, and what this means.

Gravitational waves were predicted by Einstein to explain how two things millions of miles apart can be aware of each other (think, why the Earth goes around the sun).  Basically, it is a ripple in the fabric of space-time itself that everything with mass gives out, and bigger things give off bigger ripples.  These ripples are predicted to travel at the speed of light- so, to go back to the Earth-Sun example, if the Sun disappeared this second you would have a 7 minute delay where the Earth would keep going on its orbit *as if* the Sun were still there.

Now, LIGO.  These guys did an amazing experiment where they basically had two stations, one in Louisiana and one in Washington State, where you're basically shooting a laser down a several mile long tunnel in a hope to see a ripple as a gravitational wave passed through.  This is *insanely* precise work- as in, as precise as a human hair's diameter *over three light years from Earth*.  What's more, this is only sensitive right now to the biggest, strongest gravitational wave signatures right now, such as black hole mergers- so we are not detecting planets with this anytime soon for example- but hey, gotta start somewhere!

Finally, I can't emphasize how *huge* this is!  We are literally going into a new era of astronomy right now, and I think that's no exaggeration.  Think of it this way, most of astronomy right now has been done with light, ie electromagnetic waves- with some exceptions, like cosmic rays or space missions- but pretty much all astronomy has only been with EM waves.  Now we will literally have a new tool in our toolkit and will likely learn all sorts of new things we won't have even expected.  I can't wait!

This passage appeared in the first English edition (published 1976, reprinted 2004), but for some reason it was removed in the second English edition (2009).

[You can see it here in Tadhkirah, Year 2006](http://i.imgur.com/vIl9KEz.jpg)

[But that same passage is removed from Tadhkirah, Year 2009](http://i.imgur.com/fatLI8X.jpg)


You can also find it in the Urdu version:

<TEXT> We don't accept [Mirza Ghulam Ahmad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Ghulam_Ahmad) as a prophet. His followers keep spewing the same generic rhetoric, about how they follow "true Islam" and the real peaceful and loving teachings of Islam. They often focus on preaching secular and progressive values as being part of their faith, making it easier for them to proselytize.  What they don't tell you is all the [bizarre and erroneous writings of their prophet](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1vltgo/some_questions_for_the_ahmadiyya_community/) and how differently they interpret the Quran and hadith from mainstream Muslims.  For a quick explanation, you can watch [this brother's videos on how he left Ahmadiyya.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qadiani/comments/37ymyc/shahid_kamal_leaves_ahmadiyya_group_and_becomes_a/) I have also studied their religion for myself and reached a similar conclusion.

And if any of them tries the excuse about how we should unite,  keep in mind that the Ahmadi prophet himself said that anyone who rejects him is not a real Muslim.  </TEXT>

Obviously there have been other sexual assault cases, but there was never any proof for this particular case. A 13 year old girl simply claimed that she was raped. Her story was believed and was shown all over the news. But evidence revealed that her story was not accurate and she admitted that she had lied. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **tl;dr**: The girl claimed she had been kidnapped and raped by a group of men who appeared to be Middle Eastern migrants. The story didn't gain traction until it was broadcast by a Russian state television channel.  On the Russian-speaking Internet, news of the outrage soon spread, and the case was taken as a sign that a tolerant attitude to refugees and migrants had created a public safety problem in Germany.  This was followed by public outrage, with protests outside asylum-seekers' homes.  German foreign minister accused Russia of using the case as "propaganda" to inflame domestic tensions about refugees and migrants in Germany.

<TEXT> Keeping a Dog

Whoever would keep a dog for other than hunting, herding or farming will lose a great reward every day. (Bukhari)

The majority of scholars agree that an analogy can be made for all dogs of benefit, such as guarding the house or helping the blind. The ruling according to the majority is that it is haram (forbidden) to keep a dog simply as a pet/companion. (Al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah)

The Maliki opinion is that the hadith does not indicate prohibition, rather it is makrooh (disliked). There is also a rare opinion from a handful of Malikis that all of the prohibitions on owning a dog were abrogated, and thus keeping a dog as a pet is permissible. (Kifaya al-Talib al-Rabbani)

Perhaps the second hadith on this subject is somehow related to the first.

The angels (of blessings) dont enter homes with statues, drawn pictures of live beings or dogs. (Bukhari/Abu Dawood)

This hadith indicates that for some reason, angels of blessings (not protection or writing deeds) do not like to go into homes with dogs. The hadith seems to support the Maliki ruling of dislike, but still, it is not something a Muslim should do, since it is frowned upon by authentic scripture. For this reason, and God knows best, it is best for a Muslim only to keep a dog for some necessity mentioned in the first hadith. After all, if you must have a pet, you can always get a cat or a fish. That being said, those who insist upon keeping dogs as pets in their house have some  albeit small  support in the classical interpretations; it is not something that is established as a sin based on a clear, explicit text that would make someone a heretic or deviant for breaking the rule while deeming it permissible.

http://www.virtualmosque.com/islam-studies/faqs-and-fatwas/mans-best-friend-the-islamic-view-on-dogs/

Also the dogs the Arabs were familiar with 1400 years ago were wild dogs which are not like the many breeds of domesticated dogs that exist today.  I'm not saying this changes any rulings, but it can help understand how past Muslim scholars viewed the maintenance of dogs. </TEXT>

Frequency makes no difference. If a belief system condemns an action, then the belief system shouldn't be blamed when the action is done. 

 but 99.9% of terrorist attacks globally are committed by Muslims. 

That's not true at all. Sure, in our times, Most terrorist attacks can be considered to be by Muslims but if you learn just a little bit of history then you'll know that this isn't a Muslim dominated crime.

<TEXT> I wish more people would take the time to read long thorough, well articulated responses from Muslims, but the fact is many people won't take the time to do that.

 That just antagonises people. 

I could have had a better title, but practically any criticism could be regarded as antagonizing.  I didn't think this post was unfriendly or sarcastic when posted and it was posted in /r/islam to a generally Muslim audience and not /r/worldnews after all. Perhaps you could show me how you would respond when Islam gets criticized unfairly? </TEXT>

Here is a comment of yours from 6 days ago:

 the rape culture of islam codified in the quoran has been known for centuries a. Nevertheless the latest imigration/white guilt/ race baiting trends of the left has allowed this phenomenon to develop. And its only getting worse. Weirdly enough i can guarantee that a lot of these women woud have probably been the first ones to tell yuo how islamophobic and racist you are for being against islam. Oh well enjoyed getting raped. Because it will happen in increasing numbers and the race baiting culture the left has created will shelter the rapists. Keep in mind that the leaders of the child rape gangs in the UK were yelling to the judge that he is islamophobic for convicting them for rape of children. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  And when Catholic priest Luigi rapes a boy, Christianity is to blame.

No, Christianity is NOT to be blamed, unless Christianity advocates  those kind of actions (which it doesn't).

 When an Atheist murders Muslims, Atheism is to blame.

Atheism doesn't get blamed.

 When a Muslima in hijab gets mistreated in France, the French are to blame.

No, they aren't to blame either. 

 Somehow, nobody here contests that. I wonder why.

Maybe because we don't say those things.

<TEXT> Like i said, a 2-state solution isn't enough.  It almost seems like a joke because of what Israel is doing.

Gaza is under a chronic power shortage due to the siege; Israel has severely limited the fuel supply needed to operate the only power plant in the territory. Only 46 per cent of Gaza's electricity needs are being met currently; this has triggered rolling power outages of 12 hours everyday. Amongst other things, this lack of power means that hundreds of crucial medical devices at hospital are non-functional, including Gaza's only MRI machine.


Israel's siege has meant that it is virtually impossible for Gazans to leave the occupied territory. They can't even leave to visit their relatives in the West Bank, let alone in Israel. Gazans with spouses in Israel or the West Bank are forced to live in separation; simple matters such as raising a family are rendered impracticable. Permission to leave even for severe emergencies is rarely given.

By dividing Palestinians, Israel successfully employs the 'divide and conquer' strategy like colonial powers of the past. The people of Gaza can't even seek asylum in other countries due to this restriction on movement. Even students are prohibited from going abroad, or even the West Bank, for higher education; visas of several winners of U.S. Fulbright Scholarships have been revoked in the past.

The Israeli army conducts weekly incursions into the Gaza Strip to destroy the land it has declared as 'no-go zone.' Its tanks, bulldozers and military jeeps, accompanied by helicopters and drones, systematically destroy fruit bearing trees and agricultural land in the Gaza strip. Civilian infrastructure in this area is also demolished; this includes hundreds of houses, wells and chicken farms  mosques and schools are demolished as well.

The Israeli army created a 'no-go zone' along the Israel-Gaza border that Palestinians cannot enter. This 'buffer region' extends up to 1,500 meters at times into the Strip and includes some of its most fertile land. As a result, 35 per cent of the agricultural space in Gaza is off-limits to farmers. This has seriously damaged the food economy and harshly penalized innocent farmers. Palestinians are fired at arbitrarily if they try to enter this region; farmers suffer serious injuries, and at times death, as a result of this indiscriminate firing.

Israel has announced that access to the sea six nautical miles beyond Gaza's shore is prohibited for fisherman. This means that 85 per cent of fishing waters granted to Palestinians under the Oslo Accords is now inaccessible; this has severely impacted Gaza's coastal economy. Similar to the restricted areas on land, Palestinian fishermen are regularly exposed to warning fire by Israeli naval forces, their fishing boats are intercepted and they are detained  all for the harmless act of fishing.

This is a short list of the some of the unspeakable crimes Israel commits on a defenseless population; they are at the root of this conflict. Rocket attacks from Gaza are a desperate response to these injustices  how does our government manage to omit this when brazenly expressing support for Israel ?  In light of the above, let's try to counter some of the nonsense coming out of the foreign affairs office: No people would ever tolerate an oppressive occupation and an unjust siege, so why should the Palestinians?

Of 1.5 million people living in Gaza, 1.2 million are registered refugees spread across eight camps. These refugees are made up of Palestinians, and now their decedents, who were expelled from present-day Israel in during the mass expulsion or Nakba in 1948. Since the newly created state of Israel denied the right of return to these refugees, they have been trapped in the refugee camps for the past 66 years. These refugee camps are overcrowded, cramped and under utter disrepair  unlivable by any standards.  Attempts to rebuild or renovate the camps have been restricted due to the siege. The humanitarian crisis in the camps is only magnified compared to the rest of Palestine; unemployment is high, food is scarce and fuel is scant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just be careful when you post a topic like this because it could lead to more harm. Harms like backbiting or pointless arguments or being crossposted to another sub, leading to more arguments.

 I wanted to comment on how frustrated I am that a movement that got a ton of traction turned out to be a PR stunt (if that's what it is).

Why are you assuming it was a PR stunt? A month ago, i've heard various theories on the internet like how he really intended to bomb the school, or how his dad with the help of Obama orchestrated the whole thing to get sympathy from the media or how his sister also used a hoax bomb and they were just waiting for the media to give them attention. Now some people are saying that his plan was to make money the whole time. But all of these theories are based on speculation, not facts.  

- It wasn't a briefcase, it was a pencil case.

- We have no idea how much he actually tinkered with his project, people were just speculating based on a single picture. 

- His sister never brought a hoax bomb to school, she was just in trouble for a different reason years ago. 

- No proof that father is still running for president.

- Ahmed's engineering teacher really did have an assignment for him. 

- Ahmed really did show his clock to his engineering teacher before getting in trouble with another teacher. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to historian Michael B. Oren, in his book Power, Faith, and Fantasy, Bartholdi would carve the likeness of an Egyptian peasant woman holding aloft a torch of freedom. The monument, twice as high as the Sphinx, would guard the waterways entrance and perhaps double as a lighthouse. Its name would be Egypt (or Progress) Bringing Light to Asia.

Thus, as the Daily Beasts Michael Daly pointed out on Wednesday, the nations symbol of all-American freedom and charity was in fact originally conceived as an Egyptian  and by default in those times, a Muslim.

For the next two years, Bartholdi worked on sketches and tried to persuade Ismail Pasha, the then-khedive (viceroy) of Egypt, to finance his project. But the viceroy was bankrupt by 1871 and in no condition to support a monument as large as two sphinxes.

This compelled a distraught Bartholdi to take solace in a cruise to America. As he sailed into New York harbor, he saw the egg-shaped Bedloes Island and started considering a new location for his majestic vision, imbued with new meaning.

Not long before, Bartholdi had a conversation with the French abolitionist and fervent supporter of the the North in the Civil War, douard Ren de Laboulaye, who proposed that France offer the United States a gift in recognition of the end of that conflict. After years of negotiation, it was decided that America would pay for the Statue of Libertys pedestal and France for the statue itself.

The dedication of the completed monument took place in October 1886. Oren describes the occasion in the following way:

 *The thousands of spectators who listened as President Grover Cleveland pledged not [to] forget that liberty here made her home gazed up at a creation that bore little resemblance to the one Bartholdi had visualized for Egypt. The Muslim peasant had been replaced by an idealized Western woman and the name of the piece changed from Bringing Light to Asia to Liberty Enlightening the World. Only the torch remained, unextinguished.*

 *Over the next forty years, Lady Liberty would provide millions of immigrants with their first glimpse of America, kindling their hopes for better lives and beckoning them with the possibility of freedom. For Egyptians, though, as for the many Middle Eastern peoples destined to come under foreign rule during that period, there would be no such illustrious symbols.*

So when politicians such as Ted Cruz suggest that only Christian Syrian refugees should be allowed to enter America, and critics respond with the ideals that the Statue of Liberty stands for, their statements have a particular historical resonance.

<TEXT>  And by saying this only applies to heathens of that lived then and there, then prayer only applies to Muslims who were talking to the prophet at the time he revealed the verse that demanded prayer

I'm not claiming that it only applies to one specific time. I'm saying that you have to know the context: People who broke the treaty and are at war with you.  This is the context which does not exist today for the Muslim world. A lot of verses from chapter 9 wouldn't apply today for the Muslims because the context is entirely different. 

If the Muslim world supposedly did establish a caliphate properly and if they did made a treaty with a non-Muslim nation, and if that non-Muslim nation did break that treaty, then you could argue that some of those verses from chapter 9 apply today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's good that you are restricting yourself from what might cause harm, as one narration says *"The world is a prison for a believer and Paradise for a non-believer"*.  But i think it's also critical for Muslims to still have a halal way to chill and enjoy life.  Maybe find a hobby, play sports, games, read books, etc.  Meet other Muslims to hangout with, try to find the right balance.

Recently, Saudi Arabia was criticized by a lot of people in the West for not helping any Syrian refugees, when [the reality was that they had helped probably more than any European country](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anhvinh-doanvo/europes-crisis-refugees_b_8175924.html).  Part of the problem is that people base their view on those countries based on some negative stories in the media. Saudi Arabia along with other Arab countries have a very bad image in American media. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I only said that science agrees that paradox can exist because science can't explain paradox even though it exists.

What existing paradox are you talking about that science agrees that can exist? Science doesn't deal with paradoxes. 

 Logically possible in case of God, but not logically possible for us. 

Which is exactly why it's NOT a paradox.

 Paradox is logically possible for God

It was never a paradox for God to bring things into existence from nothing.  </TEXT>

You are now making assumptions on how he was feeling and what his intentions were. You are not all-knowing.

And he said that it's allowed to seek another wife which is Islamically allowed, or are you a progressive who thinks that polygamy is haram now? His argument illustrated that using a website like Ashley Madison makes no sense, since there is no point to cheat on your spouse, you can always look for a second wife.  This is just more proof that he has no need to sign up for an account on Ashley Madison.

Exactly. So there is no proof that he used the account in UK. Your earlier comment "And then when he made subsequent payments, his location was from UK" was meaningless. You still haven't read the article. We already know the account was made in Australia, we know the emails went to spam folder which he explained. The only thing the hacker would need to do would be to sign up for it once with credit card info. He would NOT have to travel to UK to pay. Can you please accept your mistake here and move on?

 that doesn't mean anything since he only acknowledged that oddity but never defended himself against it. 

He doesn't need to defend it. He never made the argument. Do you know what a straw man is?

This is a straw man argument. Hamza even said himself that the hacker couldn't have known that Ashley Madison was going to be hacked. No one is claiming that the hacker wanted AshleyMadison to be hacked EXCEPT YOU. 

 Really? If they hacked him for money, they should have used it, 

This is nothing but speculation. We have almost no idea who the hacker was or what they wanted to do or what else they did.  You can't rely on speculation to consider someone guilty of a crime.

<TEXT> Those points have been refuted months ago. 

 And the fact he deleted the comments and then even his "rebuttal" was deleted as well is insane. He is stretching the facts a bit too much:

Yes, because he was receiving more attention than he expected. thousands of people were raiding his facebook page, including media outlets. He was receiving a lot of hateful comments. What did you expect?

 But since they magically knew Ashley Madison is going to be hacked, they quietly paid for it.

No one said that the hackers knew Ashley Madison was going to be hacked.

 How the hell could he not know he is paying for something? It shows up in your monthly bill you know.

He already explained that on his facebook, this happens to thousands of people by the way.

 He says he has filed a police report, but when the users asked him to show him the report, he refuse.

There is no need for him to show you the report.

 His account was created when he was in Australia, and it matches with the information on where the account was created. Oh hackers did that.

His credit card information was taken in Austrailia, the rest of his information was already public knowledge. The person who made the account used his public information including his public email address. 

 The hackers traveled with him to Australia to sign him up to the site. And then came back with him to UK again to pay for the site to make it look like he paid for it.

That's a strawman argument. The hacker wouldn't need to travel anywhere and Hamza never claimed such a thing to happen. </TEXT>

Everyone goes through their own unique journey in life and will have a different reaction to the text and it's arguments.  You will react, regardless of whether or not you believe, so i don't know what you mean here.

 Is that reason based on logical steps to defining reason

Yes, you can use reason and contemplate over a book to determine if it was man-made or if is Divinely originated.  Some people for example who have read the Quran, have concluded for themselves that it could not have been written by a man. There is a lot more that can be said about this subject and there are other proofs that are used, but a prerequisite is that a person should be sincerely searching for the truth and must be willing to accept something even if it goes against his desires/ego. </TEXT>

Does the book explain the purpose of life, does it give us more knowledge about who our Maker is, does it guide us toward good and move us away from evil, does it provide good lessons, stories and parables that we can benefit from, etc. We need to use reason and take time to contemplate over the message to determine if it is indeed the word of God. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  What I do find useful about debates is that when my arguments are challenged, I'm forced to think about them from a different angle to propose counter arguments. I may even form better arguments as a result, and gain more understanding about the positions I hold. I also see it as a healthy mental activity, if you're interested in it.

That's part of the problem with debating. When someone's argument is refuted, they will often attempt to rationalize their old position from a completely different angle or bring in a new related subject into the discussion turning it into a longer convoluted debate. They will never be able to admit that they're original position was wrong, and they will become close-minded toward the opposing view regardless of what they say. 

If someone is planning to debate me for the sake of mental exercise, then that's a good reason not to debate such a person.  If you want mental exercise, do math problems or something. If you want to understand the opposing view better or have someone understand your view better, have a dialogue. In a dialogue,  people are far more likely to look at the opposing view with an open mind and change their original position.  </TEXT>

 Plus, let's say all of what you're saying is correct, it's still not an excuse, just because others are doing wrong doesn't validate your wrong doing.

What exactly is my wrong-doing here? 

Can you at least admit that you have a terrible way of correcting people?

<TEXT> It is hypocritical for you to say that i  should explain how Op's beliefs are wrong when you have some of the worst explanations on this sub when correcting others.

The first post of yours i linked to  shows how you completely dismiss the entire audio without listening to it.

The second post shows how terrible you are at explaining things. Don't you realize that when you say something like *"It's well known that Islam allows us to have slaves, back in the days, when we would kill the infidels, we would take their wives as slaves"*, then people on this mostly Western-forum are going to misunderstand that? You should have explained what a slave was in the past, what rights they had and how "slave" is different than the modern understanding today. "Infidel" is not even an Islamic term, but you should have explained the conditions that were used before engaging in battle by Muslims of the past and the rights the captives had, etc.   The way you explained it made it sound like that Muslims could have just killed whoever they wanted in the past and enslaved their wives.

Those were just two of your posts, but there are  other examples of your terrible explanations. Don't you ever think to yourself that perhaps you're being downvoted on this sub because what you're saying is wrong or poorly explained?

[Here's something you just posted today](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/3li13e/what_can_we_learn_from_pope_francis_as_muslims/cv6s963). It makes you sound childish, of course you can learn from non-Muslims just like how we go to school and learn from non-Muslims.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Muslim here. 

You don't have to rely on miracles or visions like that. God gave you a brain, you can use reason and contemplate over scripture.  You should pray to God sincerely from the bottom of your heart to show you the true path wherever it is. Then you should read the [Quran](http://legacy.quran.com/) and contemplate over it's message, and decide using reason whether or not this is indeed the word of God.

You can start some kind of sister council if it's that serious, but you also need connection to some people on the men's side too that you can trust.  Every community is different. One masjid i go to has a box that anyone can write their complaints and put in, and it's read by the Imam (whom the community trusts) and that's good enough for them. Right now, the way you are describing the problem seems really vague. Physical abuse is very serious, but you need to look for strong evidence and testimony  if you want to take this further. </TEXT>

So as the new kid it was a little tough getting into the flow of things at the school. My name would always be mispronounced (even though it is spelled how it sounds), I would always hear comments like terrorist, Osama, sand nigger, AYRAB, even some interesting ones like dune coon. Kids would say them out loud in class and the teacher would act as if they did not hear a thing. But I put up with it, there was nothing else I could do... But I never learned how to brush it off, it always hurt.

When I finally found a group of kids that were the LEAST ignorant I started speaking to them in class. I was asked by one of them, "Are you parents illegal?" as a joke, and I replied "Yeah we are all fresh off the boat obviously." We went on with the day and nothing exciting happened. But it was all coming to me the next morning...

I arrive to my first class of the day about 20 minutes late (Counter-Strike was more important than school). As I sit down in my chair there is a knock at the door, a counselor peeks his head in and points to me and says, "I have to take him out for a little while." to the teacher. I remember an overwhelming sense of joy for being pulled out of that terribly boring class but that joy quickly turned into confusion.

As I walked down the hallway alongside the counselor I asked him for the reason why I was getting out of class? He just replied "We have a few things to talk about." When I sat in the chair in front of his desk he leaned forward looking me right in the eye and said, "There are accusations that you father is going to do harm to some students tomorrow." I was flabbergasted, I quickly replied, "Are you being serious?" Still looking into my eyes he said, "We got information from students that overheard you, they said your father was coming to the school tomorrow to quote "Kill all the white people."" I told him that not only was this accusation ridiculous but obviously somebody just trying to target and harass me. He said he would have a talk with the other students and get back to me, so he sent me back to class.

A few hours passed and I was in my 3rd class of the day when the counselor peeks his head into the room and pulls me out again. I ask him if the situation has been cleared up and he says that we have to go through a few steps to fix this. In my head I was thinking, "FIX WHAT? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!" But I went along with it, I had no choice.

He walks me into the main office where I sit around waiting to talk with the principal. He walks out of his office and beckons me in, I sit across from him, with the assistant principal standing in the background, and he starts speaking about the accusations against me. At first it sounded like he understood I was being targeted but then he stated, "Even though this might just be harassment I need to make sure you understand the consequences." He waited for me to reply but I couldn't, I was too terrified of the helpless position I was in right now. He pulls out a manilla folder and pulls some papers of out them and begins to explain...

The first words of the explanation were, "According to the Patriot Act..." I saw this coming, I had dreaded it and now it was upon me, I was going to be detained, my family is going to be taken away, these kids have just destroyed my ENTIRE LIFE. But there was more, he continued, "Any suspected threats to our safety or the safety of the homeland can be dealt without due process of law." He stopped and explained, "That means they can take you and your family for any reason." I began crying as he finished that sentence, but it didn't phase him he continued, "This is a very serious thing you have done RawadSquad, the consequences are very real. In fact you can even be expelled." At this point all I kept saying over and over is, "I'm sorry but this is all a lie, these kids just hate me." After a minute or two the men looked at each other and said, "Let's see if we can fix this, we have arranged a meeting with the students who overheard you and their families." I got up and was escorted out of the door.

On the other side of that door was my father, with a confused look on his face. Apparently they had contacted him and told him to come speak with the principal as well, which they did as I waited outside. The principal explained the Patriot Act to my father as well believe it or not. When my father exited the room, the principal and assistant principal followed behind, and they directed us to an adjacent room, this was where the family meeting would take place. 

I walk in to see two girls (Caucasian) and one of their mothers is there, and the other girl's father is present. We all sit down around the table and the first thing I say is, "Why would you make up a lie like that about me? Why do you hate me, because I have a different skin color?" My father grabs my arm and tells me to settle down, but the girls reply, "We heard you saying all this stuff yesterday, your parents are illegal." I was dumbfounded, I hadn't even remembered what I had said that previous day, I was even more amazed that they eavesdropped from across the room to hear that. I replied back, "That is not true, it was a joke and why would you say my dad is coming to kill all the white people tomorrow? Where did you get that?" They both stated that they had heard me say it as well, which is a COMPLETE fabrication.

Some more discussion went on in the meeting that I forget about but I remember my father apologizing to EVERYBODY in the room in my behalf and even offering proof of his citizenship, it was the most humiliating moment in my life, I can't imagine how a proud man like my father dealt with it. The meeting ended after we all apologized, even though the girls apologies were disgustingly shallow.

I remember the car ride home, my father and I broke down into tears. Our family had almost been torn apart, all because of ignorance and hate. A joking response to a racist question almost got my expelled, and almost had my family detained. That day I realized that the actions of very few on 9/11 had changed my life forever.

<TEXT> Slavery was an institutionalized practice for many parts of the world, [including in Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Africa).   Slavery took on many forms and [Islam had it's own rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/wiki/slavery) It's very easy for a person to say today that "slavery is wrong and evil" but to go back in time and overturn a integral part of a civilization would be a radical thing to do and could actually cause more harm to the society.

Slavery has been outlawed by unanimous consensus and it's hard to imagine how Muslims can export slavery back into our time in a Islamically valid way.



 If Islam in a pro-slavery religion, I am done

That's a quite ironic statement to make, especially considering how many slaves accepted Islam in the early history. One of the things that encouraged slaves to this faith was how Islam lacked a hierarchical structure.  Even in recent history, a large percentage of African slaves that were brought to America were originally Muslims.

<TEXT> For those that can't see the article:

---

Kansas loves them some voter fraud hysteria. From going to the Supreme Court to try and make doubly-sure that non-citizens cant vote in their elections to setting up a voter fraud website where citizens can report every kind of voter fraud except the kinds that have actually happened in the state, Kansas is on the forefront of voter fraud readiness and protection.

Except, perhaps, when it comes to the machines they use to record their votes.

According to the Wichita Eagle, Wichita State mathematician Beth Clarkson has found irregularities in election returns from Sedgwick County, along with other counties throughout the United States, but has faced stiff opposition from the state in trying to confirm whether the irregularities are fraud or other, less-nefarious anomalies.

Analyzing election returns at a precinct level, Clarkson found that candidate support was correlated, to a statistically significant degree, with the size of the precinct. In Republican primaries, the bias has been toward the establishment candidates over tea parties. In general elections, it has favored Republican candidates over Democrats, even when the demographics of the precincts in question suggested that the opposite should have been true.

Clarksons interest in election returns was piqued by a 2012 paper released by analysts Francois Choquette and James Johnson showing the same pattern of election returns, which favor establishment Republican candidates in primaries and general elections. The irregularities are isolated to precincts that Central Tabulator voting machines  machines that have previously been shown to be vulnerable to hacking. The effects are significant and widespread: According to their analysis, Mitt Romney could have received over a million extra votes in the 2012 Republican primary, mostly coming at the expense of Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. President Obama also ceded significant votes to John McCain due to this irregularity, as well.

You can read the paper in full here.

While Clarkson has found the same statistical irregularity in a number of localities, her efforts to confirm whether they amount to fraud have been centered on Sedgwick County, Kansas, due to the localitys use of Real Time Voting Machine Paper Tapes, which provide a paper trail that other localities dont have. However, her efforts to verify Sedgwick Countys election returns have been repeatedly shut down.

She first requested a recount of the 2013 election, but the timeframe in which a recount could have been requested had passed. She then requested the machines computer records from the Sedgwick County registrar, which told her to kindly shove off and sue Secretary of State Kris Kobach if she wanted the records so badly.

When Clarkson initially filed her lawsuit requesting the paper records from the voting machines, her suit was denied because a judge ruled that the paper records constituted ballots, shielding them from the states open records law. This ruling is suspect at best, given that the paper records to not have voters names assigned to them; they only record when and how a ballot was cast for recount purposes.

She then sought a court order giving her access to a sample of voting records in order to check voting machines error rates. This order was ignored by the Secretary of States office, despite their being legally required to respond to her within 30 days. The office later said that they didnt realize they had received her request.

Given Kansass professed diehard commitment to combatting voter fraud, one would think that they would be all for analysis into whether the integrity of their elections have been compromised. Apparently youd be wrong.

<TEXT> From my experience almost half the students that attend an Al-Maghrib class don't even pay, or at least they don't pay the full price.  And Islamic teachers should get a decent paycheck so they don't have to rely on getting another job.  Just look at how much more expensive college classes are. The prices that Al-Maghrib and Bayyinah ask for are far cheaper in comparison.  

 you're not going to humiliate yourself asking for free money when it's not an absolute necessity for life.

I would imagine masjids and Muslim communities  feel much worse when they beg for money, because they have to say it openly to everyone. Whereas if you want to take a class for free, you just talk to one guy and sign some papers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My comment was in response to the Prophet's tomb, (pbuh).  **The news article you brought up about "Saudi plan to remove tomb of Prophet Muhammad" is misleading.**

 like i said earlier its different from one school to another. the same article has this comment.

Yes and the same article discusses that. Don't just skip to  the comments on the bottom of the article.  

 The realities of history, the truth of demolishing many archaeological sites, historical locations, and other damages to the two holiest sites in Islam is something that is concrete, recorded, and undeniable. There is no doubt, a time, a place, and a discourse that must be had on the destruction of historical sites (I plan on writing a critical analysis of the destruction and preservation of historical sites in the Haramain). However, many do not know about the existence and the work of the organizations to preserve historical sites. In fact, the Center for Historical Studies and Research of Madinah has an entire division that oversees preservation of archaeological sites in Madinah, makes recommendations to the government body overseeing expansion, and I have personally witnessed the director signing 18 sites to be preserved in the future expansion of the Prophet allallhu 'alayhi wa sallam (peace and blessings of Allh be upon him)'s masjid.   Another organization that does the same in Mecca is called the Al-Furqan Islamic Heritage Foundation, and many other organizations exist both in Mecca and Madinah that work to preserve historical and archaeological sites as best as they can.  But what must be realized, what must resonate, is that there is no doubt that this strategy of manufactured journalism to sow discord is prevalent and strategically placed.

---

 When the facts are pointed out to many that the article contains false information, most seem to not care, the reality is we can't forget that Saudi did or but in Saudi type rhetoric is spreading. Even academics that lay claim to scholastic standard, even journalists, even educators many are falling prey to the exact intention of the article the sowing of discord.  For many equating Saudi to not just a government but to an ideology that pigeonhole others is becoming comfortable, again. The they and us is something that spread through the discussions on social media, no matter which spectrum the person belonged to. The standing and representing movements rather than Islam again reared its ugly head Many are letting their feelings dictate their rationaleit doesn't matter if the assertions in the article are false, there is injustice that needs to be spoken against, and criticism that needs to be made. </TEXT>

Under this Khalifa, tens of millions of Muslims in 206 nations are united into one community of Muslims and are dedicated to observing justice, engaging in dialogue, and maintaining involvement and service to local communities."

 " the Khalifa of Islam presents the true Islam that has a proven history of conquering radicalism with peace. "

<TEXT> [Article](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-01/video-shows-syrian-rebel-group-executing-18-islamic-state-fight/6588158)

[Videos (NSFW)](http://leaksource.info/2015/07/01/jihad-vs-jihad-islamic-state-syrian-rebel-group-army-of-islam-release-videos-executing-each-others-fighters/)

The group referring to itself as "Army of Islam" is battling ISIS in Syria and has turned the tables on its enemies by capturing and slaughtering 18 IS soldiers on camera. Dressed in orange jumpsuits  attire usually worn by Islamic States victims  Army of Islam (Jaysh al-Islam) soldiers lead the shackled jihadis to their deaths. Islamic States captured soldiers are forced to kneel as a commander announces: Allah did not make a disease without appointing a remedy to it. The jihadis  dressed entirely in black  are then given something to drink before each of their faces are clearly shown in the 19 minute-long video. They are then shot in the back of the head at point blank range with shotguns.

"The most serious calamity for our jihad today is a group of people who grow at a time of division among Muslims. This group claimed to be the mother state and made Takfir [accused of apostasy] on other Muslims, shed their blood and looted their properties and dignities. They worsened the ordeal of Muslims by corrupting their religion and livelihood and killing the jihadi leaders who did their best to help our stricken nation. They wreaked havoc on our people in liberated areas and cut the supply route of jihadis. They left Tehran intact and instead they attacked our mosques. This is the penalty for what they have committed. We also call on their fellows to repent." </TEXT>

<TEXT> It appears (after reading your first topic) that you are overly attached to this girl to the point of worshiping her, and she probably recognizes this. Anytime you attach yourself to anything worldly like this, you are bound to be hurt sooner or later. 

*Through my attachments, I was dependent on my relationships to fulfill my needs. I allowed those relationships to define my happiness or my sadness, my fulfillment or my emptiness, my security, and even my self-worth. And so, like the vase placed where it will inevitably fall, through those dependencies I set myself up for disappointment. I set myself up to be broken.*

It's still possible that you could end up marrying this girl or end up with another girl, but you really need to work on yourself first before even thinking about her.  You accepted Islam, that's a start. You need to keep working on self-development and improving yourself first. Understand that the type of satisfaction you are seeking can only be momentarily  satiated with such a relationship. Think more about how a long term relationship would be with such a girl look like.

*We must also realize that nothing happens without a purpose. Nothing. Not even broken hearts. Not even pain. That broken heart and that pain are lessons and signs for us. They are warnings that something is wrong. They are warnings that we need to make a change. Just like the pain of being burned is what warns us to remove our hand from the fire, emotional pain warns us that we need to make an internal change. That we need to detach. Pain is a form of forced detachment.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should get a thorough understanding of mainstream Islam first and then work your way down to divisions and sects when you have full conviction of Islam being correct.  Ahmadiyyism shares a lot of same beliefs with mainstream Muslims but they add another prophet who interprets the Quran and hadith very differently. I have personally studied their religion and found many many problems with it that contradict mainstream Islam. I made one of my topics [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1vltgo/some_questions_for_the_ahmadiyya_community/) questioning their prophet and was not able to get adequate responses from the ahmadi community.  I also had some of my topics deleted from their sub and my questions ignored.  I highly recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-yRFudnT9A) of a brother leaving the ahmadi group first. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  all prophets die, 

 none are immortal 

 we need to eat food

I thought i made it clear before that i don't disagree with any of these statements. We believe Jesus (pbuh) ascended. But we aren't sure exactly what kind of state this is or what living in this state is like or whether or not he needs food in this particular state.  

If you think that this is not possible for Allah to do, just think about the **7 sleepers of the cave: Allah kept them alive for 300 years without having to eat food**.  

There is no explicit mention of Jesus's death.  explicit means: *stated clearly and in detail, leaving no room for confusion or doubt.*   We wouldn't be having this argument and you wouldn't have to explain what some ayat imply if there really was an explicit mention of his death. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Is there an explicit statement needed for every prophet to say they have died for it to be proven? So do you have explicit Quranic statements for, say, Adam, Moses, Abraham, Isaac, Ismael....

The general rule is that people die within their lifespan. Jesus (pbuh) is an exception to this, which we only believe because prophet Muhammad (pbuh) told us about it and what he has to do against dajjal. 

 It's just taken as a given that someone who lived more than 200 years ago, let alone 2,000, is dead and it goes without saying.

Like i said, we don't know what kind of state he is in or how he is living in such a state.   Or are you having trouble believing how such a thing is possible for Allah? 


 In fact the burden on proof is on the Sunnis to show a single verse of the Quran which states he is still alive. 

Now you are confusing Ahmadi sources of reference for our sources of references. I  told you that we  have proof that Jesus (pbuh) is alive in our sources. Ahmadi's don't accept narrations which is funny because Mirza Ghulam Ahmad tried to make sense of several hadith in his writings but conveniently left the ones which contradicted his teachings. 



 I can show you many more which in my view prove he is dead 

Yes, you have shown me ayat which **you interpreted** somehow to mean that he died. But i have to yet to see one explicit ayah which makes such a claim.

<TEXT>  prophets are not immortal

True.

 all prophets die

True.

 prophets need to eat food 

Also true. Jesus (pbuh) needed food when he was on Earth and will need food again when he returns to Earth. The Quran doesn't mention what kind of state Jesus (pbuh) is right now, or if he still eats food in his current state.   Note that the 7 sleepers of the cave survived without food for 300 years so it's very possible that Jesus (pbuh) doesn't need food in his current state.

There is no explicit statement in the Quran that Jesus (pbuh) died. That is just your misinterpretation.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  On Jesus - if the Quran pretty much explicitly states Jesus has passed away (as I believe the verses I quoted above demonstrate) then you will take a hadith over that?

Don't be dishonest with yourself, that's not an explicit statement at all. The ayah you brought up says that 'they ate food' which is true.    It wouldn't make sense to say that 'they are eating food', because Mary had already passed away and Jesus (pbuh) wasn't even on the surface of the Earth when the Quran was revealed. </TEXT>

Traveling for days, little food, little armor, few weapons, no medicine and being outnumbered by enemies; it was never an easy task. It makes sense that 'Jihad' is the term that can be used for fighting.

<TEXT> As-salamu alaykum

 The reason I'm saying this is because some verses in the Quran can be taken out of context by Islamophobes and terrorists.

But you can do this with any book. All the verses Islamophobes use, you can debunk most of them right away just by reading the before and after verses. It's true though that the Quran doesn't mention all of the context; if it did, it would be a much longer book.  

The Quran is a brief speech in response to it's historical context (seerah) and at the same time it's a general guide for humanity. The Quran rarely mentions times, dates, places and even names so it's a general book that every community can relate to. </TEXT>

You can't make this statement **as a Muslim**. It doesn't make sense for you to believe that the Quran was altered **as a Muslim**. You can however question it all you want **as a non-Muslim** and Muslims will debate with you about it academically. 

 If we can't question, examine, or pick apart our holy book, how can we call ourselves scholars?

Unlike other religions, Muslim scholars don't debate whether or not the  Quran is accurate or authentic; it's part of the faith. Muslim scholars will however discuss and examine the interpretation of the ayat. </TEXT>

If you believe the Quran is God's words, then you cannot say that the Quran is wrong or question whether it is really God's words; that would make your testimony of Islam a lie.

But it doesn't make sense for you to deny or question God's command of giving charity as a Muslim.  

And of course non-Muslims are allowed to criticize Islam. We do it on this sub all the time and we have Muslim groups who discuss with non-Muslims, answer their questions and debate. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  your speech creates an unhealthy working environment, private employers have the right not to let you work for them anymore. This isn't oppressive. This is logical business practice.

EXACTLY. Private employers, like those in a magazine publishing company, have the right to penalize those who make racist, sexist, homophobic, antisemitic or anti-Islam remarks. Similarly, countries also have the right to decide whether or not to penalize those who publicly make these remarks hence passing laws such as Gayssot law.

You can't seem to grasp the fact that other countries might disagree with you regarding the limits to freedom of speech and it is their right to have their own laws. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As you know, Islamic states are more restrictive regarding freedom of expression. Different Islamic states throughout history have had different rules and laws towards how to deal with people who publicly mock Islam. There are certain fatwas that call for the death penalty for such cases, but these fatwas aren't absolute. 

I can't say that i understand the fatwa op is talking about or why the author of that fatwa calls for death in retaliation for such an offense, but i personally do believe that there should be restrictions regarding mockery towards religions (not including intellectual criticism of a religion).  I understand that you will disagree, but that is what i believe. 

edit: And before you start critisizing me for wanting limitations on Freedom of speech, please do realize that France ALREADY has these restrictions towards Judaism. In fact, a satirist in the exact same newspaper was fired, and then put on trial for an anti-Semitic article that he had written.

<TEXT> Peace be with you, bro.

I have personally studied Ahmadiyya literature myself to see if they sincerely were on the right path. I didn't focus so much on the final prophet issue, because they have written tons of literature to step around the simple fact that Muhammad (pbuh) truly is the seal of the prophets. Instead i read some of their other literature and found that they have a lot of different beliefs than mainstream Muslims. The Ahmadiyya group makes an effort to interpret Islam to appeal more to to opinions of modern society and fit with modern science. So far example, they will denounce all Jihad and commonly quote "Love for All, Hatred for None" even though Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote a lot of hateful stuff about the Christian community and in order to explain the great influence the Christian clergy had during his time, he would often refer to them as the 'Dajjal'.  Another example would be of  Adam (pbuh) not being allowed to go near the tree: ahmadis interpret that to mean that they weren't allowed to go near the entire family "tree" of not-yet evolved humans. 

[You should watch this video of one Muslim leaving the ahmadiyya community.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFFsHGXcUI)

Yes, but how exactly are they being oppressive? Just saying they are "oppressive" doesn't really mean anything. Were these regimes actively killing Sunnis? Were they united in their opposition against Sunni Muslims?

There isn't much of a difference. 

Condone: accept and allow (behavior that is considered morally wrong or offensive) to continue.

 If that near-half of Indonesian Muslims who admitted to Pew Polling their desire for gay people to be torturously, publicly murdered had their way, the stonings would happen. 

Again, this is a misleading statement. Like i said before, they condemn gay marriage   penalize public sexual intercourse. They would NOT, if they had their way, go out and stone someone who has an abnormal sexual preference.

Sure, Muslims in Indonesia don't recognize Gay marriage and they would probably penalize public gay/straight sexual intercourse and i understand that you disagree with this stance. But to say that they condone going out to stone Gays to death is a FOX-news type of stretch.

<TEXT> Welcome to r/islam! I hope you find suitable answers and resources here.

 What is Islam? What are the principal doctrines of Islam?

The word Islam means voluntary Submission or Surrender to the Will of God. It derives from the root word salam, meaning peace.
In the Quran, God defines that the only purpose for which He created mankind is to Worship Him. Islam recognizes that humankind has free choice in whether to obey or disobey God, but ultimately we will be held accountable to God in the next life for the choices that we make in this life.

God sent Prophets to teach mankind how to worship Him; starting with Adam, including Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and the last of the messengers, Muhammad (peace be upon them all). The Islamic position is that all of these prophets came with the same message, that there is no deity worthy of worship except the One True God, known in Arabic as Allah.

Islam places great importance in the belief that the soul gives life to a human body. Likewise, in its absence, the human body dies and disintegrates. However, the soul is eternal and will be reunited with the body on the Day of Resurrection, when God will raise everyone to answer for their deeds on earth. Islam encourages the individual to focus on keeping the soul healthy, through the remembrance, obedience and worship of God. There should be a correct balance in strengthening the soul and not over-indulging with the pleasures of the body. Islam is a natural way of life that encourages one to give due attention to their relationship with God and His creation. Islam teaches that it is through the doing of good deeds and seeking the pleasure of God that souls find true happiness and peace. It is in this context that the word Islam derives from the root word salam, or peace.  

Feel free to check some of the sources on the right, especially underneath the Christianity section.

Get married, find good company, do something to help you stay away for good. Keep in mind that you are being  rewarded for engaging in Halal relationships. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The word Islam means voluntary Submission or Surrender to the Will of God. It derives from the root word salam, meaning peace.

In the Quran, God defines that the only purpose for which He created mankind is to Worship Him. Islam recognizes that humankind has free choice in whether to obey or disobey God, but ultimately we will be held accountable to God in the next life for the choices that we make in this life.

God sent Prophets to teach mankind how to worship Him; starting with Adam, including Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and the last of the messengers, Muhammad (peace be upon them all). The Islamic position is that all of these prophets came with the same message, that there is no deity worthy of worship except the One True God, known in Arabic as Allah.

Islam places great importance in the belief that the soul gives life to a human body. Likewise, in its absence, the human body dies and disintegrates. However, the soul is eternal and will be reunited with the body on the Day of Resurrection, when God will raise everyone to answer for their deeds on earth. Islam encourages the individual to focus on keeping the soul healthy, through the remembrance, obedience and worship of God. There should be a correct balance in strengthening the soul and not over-indulging with the pleasures of the body.
Islam is a natural way of life that encourages one to give due attention to their relationship with God and His creation. Islam teaches that it is through the doing of good deeds and seeking the pleasure of God that souls find true happiness and peace. It is in this context that the word Islam derives from the root word salam, or peace.

<TEXT> The Ahmadiyya group makes an effort to interpret Islam to appeal more to modern society and fit with modern science.  Someone with little knowledge of Islam, may end up falling for the ahmadiyya interpretation instead because their interpretation appeals more to the society they grew up in. But when you study more about Islam, and you study more of science, you'll realize insha'Allah, that their claims don't work.

So for example: Adam (pbuh) was told not to go near the tree. "O that must have been the entire human family tree - human evolution - that he wasn't supposed to go near".  -actual Ahmadiyya claim.

Any fighting is looked down upon in modern society. "Jihad doesn't mean physical fighting, it's only spiritual struggle. Muslims should never physically fight".  -Ahmadi's are against fighting in pretty much any context.

I have debated with the Ahmaddiya community before until they stopped talking to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're new to Islam, then you don't really  have to bother with the shia sunni split. The split was due to a political difference that happened many years ago after Muhammad (pbuh).  They may pray slightly different, not a big deal really.  Its not like they split because of a creedal difference.

There are however splinter groups that formed overtime with different creeds, but they are always a minority and you really don't have to bother to learn about them.  Like i said, study from mainstream sources and if you wish, you can work your way then to other sources.

I could say more, but I don't want to confuse you.  Peace. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   So I am about to read the quran, and I saw that it was translated by ahmadiyya muslims (should I be wary about this translation?)

**DO NOT** read that translation that was sent by the person who sends spam messages.  It is very misleading.   I already refuted many of his claims in previous topics.

Go to Quran.com instead. 


 What hope is there for a muslim if it is a 1 in 73 chance of going to heaven?

That's not how it works. The spammer wants to convince you that Muslims are divided into 73 sects, and that he happens to be belong to the "saved" sect. Muslims are NOT divided to 73 sects as he portrays and Ahmaddiya are not even a sect.  

Study from mainstream sources (like the ones in the sidebar) and if you wish, you can then work your way down to other sources. The more you learn the more things will become clear to you.

<TEXT> Al-Masih ad-Dajjal (Arabic for "the false messiah"), is an evil figure and one of the biggest trials humanity will face right before the Day of Judgement.   He will claim to be Jesus (pbuh) and many people will fall for his tricks and begin to worship him as God. 

Narrated Ibn Umar: Once Allah's Apostle stood amongst the people, glorified and praised Allah as He deserved. Then, mentioning Dajjal, he said, "I warn you against him (i.e. the Dajjal) and there was no prophet but warned his nation against him. No doubt, Noah warned his nation against him but I tell you about him something of which no prophet told his nation before me. You should know that he is one-eyed, and Allah is not one-eyed."

<TEXT> I'd like to shed some light on this:  

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was born in the 19th century and considered himself to be the Messiah.  Now we all know that the messiah has to defeat the dajjal, but who could possibly be considered the anti-Christ if the messiah arises during this time? Ghulam Ahmad therefore concluded that the **Christian clergy living in the West** to be the strongest proponent against Islam during his time, so he considered them to be the greatest Dajjal.  He says in his book by misinterpreting the Quran that: *"The Holy Quran then specifies that in the latter days the Christians will dominate the earth, and they shall be the cause of all kinds of mischief running rampant."* Ghulam Ahmad also considered Satan, European philosophers and a bunch of other people to also be dajjals.  It's important to note that Ahmadis believe in many Dajjals and even the possibility of other messiahs (it's weird, i know).

[You can check out the chapter of Dajjal in Ghulam Ahmad's book here.](http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/book/The_Essence_of_Islam/?p=3#page/279/mode/1up)

None of this is proof for your claim: *"women were created FOR men"*.  Likewise Muhammad (pbuh) said that Women have rights over their husbands; this doesn't mean now that men were created for women.

<TEXT>  Lies! There are no musts, there is a possibility another Messiah may come, but the seeds for the defeat of the Dajjal have been sown already.

Wrong once again. Here is a list of proofs against your claim.

"Then Jesus son of Marry will descend at the white minaret to the east of Damascus. He will then catch him up at the date of Ludd and kill him." - Sunan Abi Dawud 4321

"The Dajjal would appear in my Ummah and he would stay (in the world) for forty - I cannot say whether he meant forty days, forty months or forty years. And Allah would then send Jesus son of Mary who would resemble 'Urwa b Mas'ud. He (Jesus Christ) would chase him and kill him. Then people would live for seven years that there would be no rancour between two persons." -Sahih Muslim 2940

"Son of Maryam (Mary) will kill the Dajjal at the door of LUD." Imam Tirmidhi(d.279/857)

"It may be asked: Jesus, son of Mary, was to come to vanquish the Dajjal, and if it is you who have come in the spirit of Jesus, son of Mary, who then is the Dajjal against you? My answer is that, though I admit the possibility of another Messiah son of Mary coming after me, and he may even be the promised one in the context of some Ahadith, and a Dajjal may also come to mislead the Muslims, yet my belief is that so far there has not been any Dajjal like the Christian clergy of these days, nor shall there ever be till the Day of Judgement." -Mirza Ghulam Ahmad


"Certainly, the time of prayer shall come and then Jesus, son of Maryam (Mary) would descend and would lead them to prayer. When the enemy of Allah would see him, He would (dI`sappear) just as the salt dissolves itself in water and if he (Jesus) were not to confront them at all, even then it would dissolve completely, but Allah would kill them by His hand and He would show them their blood on his lance (the lance of Jesus Christ)." Imam Muslim (d.261/839)

  Look how he organised a tiny jamaat like ours to be a force... 

That's fine.  But you didn't answer the question.  How did he reform **Islam**?

 The Qur'an doesn't say many things, doesn't mean they didn't happen.

Exactly! So can you prove to me how the Quran says Jesus (pbuh) did not ascend above?

<TEXT>   Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is the Messiah and Mahdi promised to us in the Qu'ran and that he is the metaphorical second coming of Jesus Christ (AS).

This isn't true. Even Ahmadiyya beliefs point out that another Messiah (NOT Mirza Ghulam Ahmad) must come in order to defeat the Dajjal, since the dajjal isn't defeated.

 rather his purpose was to reform Islam back to its original state as it was under the Prophet.

And what exactly did he reform?

 We also believe Hadhrat Isa was not actually raised to heaven, as evidenced by the Qu'ran and many precedents Allah the Almighty has set before.

The Quran never says Jesus (pbuh) traveled to India and died there. We know from Hadith that Jesus (pbuh) will kill the Dajjal before the Last Day. </TEXT>

I sincerely spent many days reading through ahmadiyya literature, going to their subreddit, asking many questions, conversing with other ahmadis in order to find out what they truly believe or whether or not they are telling the truth.  And i came to the same conclusion.  I still welcome any ahmadis to talk to me about their faith, but i rarely visit their subreddit after they were unable to answer my questions and they deleted some of my posts. 


  why do Muslims call other Muslims nonbelievers if the only one who can ultimately judge this is Allah azawajel?

Allah commanded us to follow Muhammad (pbuh), not Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. 

Even their prophet, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad calls you and me: non-Muslims because we don't accept his prophethood.  </TEXT>

Can I ask how this is so? From what I learned, the ahmadiyya community don't consider Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be The Messiah, but rather 'a Messiah'.  Since Dajjal hasn't been defeated, more Messiahs may come in the future.  This is contrasted with the beliefs of Sunni/Shia Muslims, Christians and Jews who only believe in a single Messiah. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A good portion of Ahmadi texts are close to what mainstream Muslims already believe. There is some discussion on the states of man, ego, and good character which you can also find in some Sufi books. Among the  problematic parts are when Mirza Ghulam Ahmad interprets the Quran   hadith to suit the world around him during his own lifetime in the 19th century.  So for example, in order to explain the great influence the Christian clergy had during his time, he would often refer to them as the 'Dajjal' and would refer to himself as the 'promised Messiah'.  He also made some false prophecies that involved his own death, so he wouldn't have to take any repercussions for being wrong. For example he said "I will die either in Mekkah or Medina" but he died in India instead and so ahmadis have to come up with their own way to interpret his prophecies to mean something else. 

I made a short list of some strange statements i found in an ahmadiyyah book, called ["The Essence of Islam" here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1vltgo/some_questions_for_the_ahmadiyya_community/). </TEXT>

Well of course you shouldn't.  But there will be people every now and then who interpret the Quran in a controversial way that only makes sense to them and that goes in contradiction with another part of the faith.  Sometimes these interpretations can lead a group to the point where they are now considered to be following a whole new religion. This certainly happened among the Christians and it has also happened among the Muslims.

<TEXT>  The paragraph leading to this quote advises men to be exemplary role models for their women, and gender roles. When used in context it is clear what the writer is intending to convey when he says* (women are the root of idol worship, for they are naturally devoted to decoration and ornaments. This is why idolatry started with women.)*. The writer is clearly not wrong when he says women are naturally drawn to jewelry and ornaments, and some who are not religious idolize their worldly possessions to an extent that it mimics worship.

**Thank you for proving my point.**

Looks like you don't understand what 'Out of context' is. [This is quoting out of context:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_quoting_out_of_context)  For example, the ad copy for New Line Cinemas 1995 thriller Se7en attributed to Owen Gleiberman, a critic for Entertainment Weekly, used the comment a small masterpiece. Gleiberman actually gave Se7en a B overall and only praised the opening credits so grandiosely: The credit sequence, with its jumpy frames and near-subliminal flashes of psychoparaphernalia, is a small masterpiece of dementia.

Now tell me how the surrounding paragraphs changes the meaning of the line: "Women are the root of idol worship".  Or do you agree that women are indeed the root of idol worship? </TEXT>

<TEXT> What you're writing is utter bullshit.

Sunni Muslims arent the only muslims in the world. There is a significant part of the world which is Shia. They were not united EVER, after the death of the Holy Prophet PBUH. In fact, they killed each other with pleasure.

Whereas the Ahmadi Muslims are more united than the "Muslims" in Muslim countries. And as the number of Ahmadis grow, they all unite under one Caliph.

Death IS glorified. Fidayeen.. do you know that that is? Look it up. Muslims are synonymous with suicide attacks. Majority of Pakistanis at least were FOR suicide bombings. What does that tell you?

But again, stop wasting my time. I just dont have the patience of a priest required to address stupidity of your level.

Along with a leader, the less followers you have, the easier it is to be unified.  Look at how unified the Nation of Islam is and look at how unified religious cults are.  On the other hand you have sunni Muslims who are nearing a billion and have no leader.  What did you expect?

You have a big misunderstanding.  Islam =/= Muslims.
Just because some Muslims commit crimes does not mean that Islam supports their actions.

Similarly, just because you are using bad language, does not mean that the ahmadiyya community supports using bad language. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   I believe the sole reason why Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad has to be a prophet was because of the establishment of a caliphate. Muslims have to be united under a Caliph, that is what everyone says.

Sunni Muslims had a khalipha before and after Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.  And they certainly weren't united after Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's death.

 In mainstream Islam, death is glorified as the best thing ever. But if everyone died, who is going to do God's work? 

That's just a misunderstanding on your part. 

 *Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "None of you should wish for death. If he does good, he may increase in it, and if he does evil, he may turn in repentance." [Agreed upon. This is the version of al-Bukhari]* </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Well I have news for you, Ahmadiyyat has been combating all types of allegations way before you were born and not one exists which hasn't been answered.

Well then please answer mine. I brought up several passages from a book written by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad himself that are un-prophet like things to say. Explain those passages to me.  Basically all i got so far was the false "out of context" accusations, which anyone who actually reads the book can see is not true.

If you want to hand out literature, go ahead. At least understand it first. </TEXT>

And TheGravemind didn't even bother to explain how that 1 passage was out of context; he just tried to justify the quote: "Christianity is the perfect manifestation of Satan". Which I also responded to, but it looks like you missed that part.

For those that don't know, [this is quoting out of context:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_quoting_out_of_context)  For example, the ad copy for New Line Cinemas 1995 thriller Se7en attributed to Owen Gleiberman, a critic for Entertainment Weekly, used the comment a small masterpiece. Gleiberman actually gave Se7en a B overall and only praised the opening credits so grandiosely: The credit sequence, with its jumpy frames and near-subliminal flashes of psychoparaphernalia, is a small masterpiece of dementia. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  the truth is Muslims are not united, it is only wishful thinking.

Muslims are united against Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. And if you truly feel that there isn't anything to discuss, then feel free Not preaching to others as well.


  One thing I don't understand from the Muslim anti-Ahmadiyya forces is that we are basically calling people towards Allah and his Prophet(phuh) and we are being preventing from doing so from people who supposedly also believe in Allah and his Prophet(pbuh).

lol don't try to sidestep away from the area of contention.  The problem is NOT that you are calling to Allah and his messenger (pbuh) but rather that you are calling to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.  And who are these "Muslim anti-Ahmadiyya forces" you speak of?

  we should concentrate on strengthening our relationship with Allah rather than pointing out flaws in others because on the day of judgement it will be our own deeds which will determine our fate not what others were up to.

Perhaps you have misunderstood me.  I am not speaking against your actions. I am speaking out against *the message you preach*. If the Ahmadiyya community spends effort preaching their faith to others, why not start with me? </TEXT>

Edit: There are also some mistakes in that message.

 lives by the motto "love for all, hatred for none"

Yes this is the ahmadiyya motto, but there is certainly hate in ahmadiyya texts regarding certain groups that disagree.  Some ahmadi's left some not-so-loving comments about r/islam just [a few hours ago.](http://i.imgur.com/ZS2Y4nO.png)

 There are 73 sects within Islam and i belong to the r/ahmadiyya Muslims sect.

One may infer from this part that the Muslims in the world are split into 73 sects, with ahmadiyya being one of them.  However this is far from reality.  I have yet to hear from one mainstream Muslim scholar that would consider the ahmadiyya to be a sect. [More about it from this video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fDXifZ5jnY)

 Ahmadiyya Muslims Community is the fastest growing sect of Islam.

In terms of total number, i'm pretty sure both Sunni   Shia Muslims have each gained a lot more followers in the last 100 years than the ahmadiyya community.

 Just a side note, the commentary is necessary as Islam has two texts....

Except that Ahmadiyya commentary that is referenced is NOT necessary.  Along with a good portion of correct information, the referenced commentary also includes "hidden meanings of verses" that apparently only the ahmadiyya can decipher and would be considered completely wrong by mainstream scholars.

No. It's not like we have a definite measure for what a Heaven consists of or a detailed explanation of the physical properties of each Heaven.

So we don't just start forming our own conclusions like: "2nd heaven=moon, 3rd heaven=mercury, etc." and then probably use that as a refutation against religion.

*"Tell me why we have to go through this every single time?

<TEXT> I'm just going to assume this is not another ahmadiyya troll.

 There are several types of "jihad" in Islam, most of them are about self-purification.

Yes, the most important Jihad as understand by orthodox Muslims is [striving against the ego](http://muslimmatters.muslimmatters.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/nafs.pdf)

  Islam teaches "love for your homeland."

Yes, orthodox Islam teaches that we should help others, especially our neighbors. 

 Buddha, Krishna, Confucius, Zoroaster, and even maybe Socrates, and a few others are apparently probably "prophets" of Islam.

It is possible that some of them are prophets, yes.

 Evolution and natural selection are supported by Islam.

[Evolution was discussed hundreds of years ago by Muslims](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/226430?uid=3739832 uid=2 uid=4 uid=3739256 sid=21103361579393).  Not all Muslims hold onto it as a fact, however.

 "love for all hatred for none"

No, we do not love Satan and his followers. </TEXT>

This picture is laughable. It presumes to know a definite measure of a heaven.  And the same with the Throne of Allah, which is understand to be impossible to imagine by Muslims.  But atheists will try...

Also side note: i thought the 7 Earths held a esoteric meaning and that they were layered, not upon each other.  Can a Muslim correct me if i am wrong? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  All of you anti-Ahmadiyya know that you'd lose a debate in half of a second if you tried to engage in one, which is why you rely on stupidity like "ALL 72 SECTS ARE IN AGREEMENT AHMADIYYA ARE KUFFAR LOL" or similar tactics to silence the Ahmadiyya.

I agree that some of the comments may be unconstructive, but your comment here is also rather coarse.  

If you're an open-minded person, I'd be willing to engage in a substantive debate with you. 

I mean, if anyone is afraid of losing a debate, it's probably the moderator at r/ahmadiyya that keeps removing my comments. </TEXT>

But what do you make out of all the tafseers, scholars and ulama of the past who did regard Muhammad (pbuh) as the last prophet? Were they all wrong? What about all the hadith that specifically mention Muhammad (pbuh) as the last prophet.

<TEXT> Hey, i appreciate your response. [All of the passages are from this book](http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/book/The_Essence_of_Islam/?p=3#page/279/mode/1up) and i posted the page numbers above.

  the Ahmaddiya movement is a sect of Islam

 why thank you

Yeah, i didn't know what to call it without offending anyone.

 It's fairly common knowledge that Satan loves bid'aa/innovation because it makes people do evil whilst deceiving themselves by thinking that they're actually doing good. With Trinitarian Christianity (the one referred to by the quote), this is also the case. 

I understand what your saying, but the "perfect manifestation of Satan"?  There are **many** religious groups that associate partners with Allah, some only worship the creation.   How are Christians the "perfect manifestation of Satan"? Especially when the Quran says: *"and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, "We are Christians."*

 Every single tafseer in history by every single scholar portrays surah al-Fatiha as specifically asking Allah (swt) to not let us go astray as the Jews and Christians did. To remain on "the straight path."

Exactly! Then why does Mirza Ghulam Ahmad say "prescribes supplication for refuge against the evil of the Christians."? -this is wrong.

 Since the dajjal is "human" in one sense or another, this is what this is referring to. The one that will peddle evil into the breasts of mankind from amongst other humans.

Okay, so what is the definition of "Dajjal" as you understand it? Because according to the context of the Surah along with your explanation, dajjal is referring to someone who encourages others to do wrong. This seems way to broad of a definition.

 And this is obviously true since Allah (swt) is Merciful, for example, and Muhammad (pbuh) was also merciful. Of course, their mercy is not comparable in quantity since Allah's (swt) Mercy is infinite

Agreed. However that's Not what the text implies. If your understanding of the text was correct, then the sentence: "They are demonstrated only by Prophets" indicates that only prophets can show mercy.  And this we know is not true.

 Christianity is the largest religion in the world and the strongest nation in the world is also predominantly Christian. It has been this way since the British empire, too.

Altough barely, yes, Christianity is the largest religion in the world.  But we live in a largely secular world today if you haven't noticed. The Bible hardly plays a role in the lives of many Christians, most don't even go to church every Sunday anymore. 
I would also like to know where the Quran says that Christians will dominate the Earth in the last days. And also your response to the other quotes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [I am not trying to insult or attack anyone, i just have some questions.  I am asking here because i know there are several Ahmadi members who visit this subreddit and whenever i post on [r/ahmadiyya](http://www.reddit.com/r/ahmadiyya/), my comments keep getting removed.]

For those that don't know, the Ahmaddiya movement is a group that believes that a 19th century man from India named [Mirza Ghulam Ahmad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Ghulam_Ahmad) is the promised Messiah of Islam. Along with this, they hold onto several other beliefs that may be controversial to mainstream Muslims. 

I was encouraged to learn about their faith and go through some of their books, including one book called: ["The Essence of Islam" (Vol 3)](http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/book/The_Essence_of_Islam/?p=3#page/279/mode/1up) by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.  A good portion of the information appears to be regurgitated sufism, including some interesting passages that I don't have much knowledge about, but some passages were completely bizarre and stood out to me and I just don't understand how a prophet of God can say these things.  I would like to hear what the Ahmadiyya community thinks of the following passages:

 * **"As Christianity is the perfect manifestation of Satan" (p. 279)** -I understand Christians have different beliefs, but perfect manifestation of Satan??

 * **"Surah Al-Fatihah makes no mention of Dajjal, but prescribes supplication for refuge against the evil of the Christians." (p. 279)** -But surah Al-Fatiha doesn't do this at all. Al-Fatiha is asking to not follow the path of the believers of the past who went astray. 

 * **Regarding the last word of the Quran "the word Nas [People] refers to the Dajjal" (p. 286)** - I was really surprised at this, if An-Nas could mean dajjal, then what other words refer to Dajjal?

 * **"Divine attributes are eternal and ever-lasting. They are demonstrated only by Prophets." (p. 119)** -No, prophets are just human beings who are not eternal and are not comparable to Allah.

 * **"Women are the root of idol worship, for they are naturally devoted to decoration and ornaments. This is why idolatry started with women. They are also less courageous. Under the slightest stress of hardship, they begin to cringe before their fellow creatures" (p.324)** -Can someone please explain how idolatry started with women? I never heard this before.

 * **"Then He says that at the time of Dhulqarnain (Promised Messiah) all people will rise up in support of their own religion and will attack each other like the waves of the sea." (p. 301)** -But this didn't even come close to happening.

 * **"Women are influenced by their husbands. To the extent that a husband excels in piety and righteousness, his wife will also partake of it. Similarly, if the husband is wicked, the wife too will share his evil." (p. 324)** -This could sometimes happen, but isn't necessarily true.

 * **"The Holy Quran then specifies that in the latter days the Christians will dominate the earth, and they shall be the cause of all kinds of mischief running rampant." (p. 283)** -Where does the Quran say this? And i don't see how Christians are dominating the earth today.

 * **"I admit the possibility of another Messiah son of Mary coming after me" (p. 289)** -this seems contradictory to everything he mentioned before about himself being the promised Messiah.



Again I'm not trying to ridicule anyone, I am just asking Ahmadis how they deal with passages like these.   No, i didn't copy these from anti-ahmadiyya sites and please don't say "out of context" when the context clearly does not change the passage i have posted.  Thanks for any replies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the response. 

 It means this in the sense that it's the perfect manifestation of Satan, or Satanic influences, in that it misleads people in thinking that they're doing good things while doing bad things, which would be associating partners with Allah (swt.) This doesn't mean all Christianity is bad or that all Christianity is like this. It's just an indictment of the forms of it that do that.

My main problem is the wording "perfect manifestation". Yes they associate partners, but many other groups also associated partners. 
It's hard to believe a prophet would say that Christianity is the "perfect manifestation of Satan", especially when the Quran says: "and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, "We are Christians." That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant."

 he is the mercy to mankind, after all.

Muhammad (pbuh) is **a** mercy to mankind. 

 No, you're wrong, yes it does: http://quran.com/1/6-7
 Almost every single tafsir in history interprets those two verses are a prayer to ask Allah (swt) to not let the Muslims go down the path of the Jews or Christians.

Your explanation is closer to the truth in that We are asking to not follow the path of the believers (of the past) who went astray.  However Mirza Ghulam ahmad's words saying that we are asking for "refuge against the evil of the Christians" is just plain wrong.

 The last two verses are talking about those who whisper evil into the breasts of mankind from among the jinn and mankind. The people who do that from among mankind would, of course, be the dajjal.

I understand Mirza Ghulam ahmad uses the word 'dajjal' very very loosely, but dajjal Does Not refer to all human beings who tell lies or all human beings who do evil. 

 Your denial of this part comes across as incredibly stupid and just grasping at straws, with respect.

I guess you believe that dajjal means any wrongdoer? Besides the believers who isn't a dajjal according to mirza ghulam ahmad? </TEXT>

So I've been continuing my research and going through the book: ["The essence of Islam".](http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/book/The_Essence_of_Islam/?p=3#page/279/mode/1up)  A good portion of the information in this book is already known to Sufi Muslims, including some interesting passages that I don't have much knowledge about, but some passages were completely bizarre and stood out to me and I just don't understand how a prophet of God can say these things.

<TEXT>  The Qur'an itself mandates the mubahala and to invoke the "curse of Allah" on the liar.  

This is different to the instance mentioned in the Quran. Where both parties pray together and have the wrong one cursed. In other words, you can actually see a group being cursed or blessed while some or all of them are still alive. This does Not have a win-win nature to it.

 it could theoretically be convenient for him, but if you really think that, it means that you have no faith in Allah and His ability.

It's not theoretically convenient; it is convenient.  It's like a man betting money that he will stay alive for the next 3 years. He doesn't have to worry taking account for it.

 If a false prophet ever invoked Allah's name to spread his treachery and lies, Allah, the Only Power, would surely annihilate him and make an example of him very quickly

This is NOT true at all.  There have been numerous false prophets making prophecies of their own emerging from Muslim and Christian communities.   

 the 4th Caliph of the Movement), himself an incredibly awe-inspiring man, won a prayer duel and is recorded to have had a True Dream from Allah in which he correctly predicted that Zia would not escape his terrible death 5 days before it happened.

You do realize that dream interpretation (to understand the future) is well known throughout Islamic history?

 Communities founded by liars are not allowed by Allah to flourish in this manner. 

Again, this isn't true at all. I suggest you look into the history of various sects founded by false prophets.  Some of these false prophets gained a strong following, like the Mormons or the Nation of Islam.  [Here is a bunch of new religious movements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_new_religious_movements). Some of them are older and more popular than the ahmadiyya community. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Quran speaks out against disobedient Jews, Christians and Muslims and favors obedient Jews, Christians and Muslims.  

Part of the wisdom why the tribe of Israel is criticized early in the Quran is because they resemble closest to the newly formed group of prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and so it is admonition for the new generation of believers.  

If any part of the Quran in particular appears strange or offensive to you in some way, please ask about it here. 

----------

Also bonus: take a look back at the 1st chapter. There are 3 groups of people mentioned: 

1) Those who are favored by God

2) Those who earned the wrath of God

3) Those who went astray

The Jews and Christians were favored in particular ways, but some Jews (who were disobedient) earned the wrath of God, while some Christians (who were disobedient) went astray (in their beliefs).  

We should all desire to be like the obedient believers of the past. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay fine, just show me where i can find a good amount of his sayings.  Any books he wrote? Any speeches?

 There is no clear description of what the Dajjal is.. what it looks like.. etc, you need to interpret the hadith in a manner that fits the current times.

So the definition of Dajjal changes overtime? Or is it only supposed to fit the 21st century?  So how do You understand who the Dajjal is. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Throughout history most people didn't know or believe this, modern muslims and people on this sub have toned it down to "it's ok to be gay but not to do gay things"

I understand that you aren't Muslim but still lurk this sub, and that's fine, but please don't give wrong answers on this subreddit when people are genuinely asking about Islam. 

There is no proof whatsoever that having sexual desires for the same gender is a sin.  There has never been any proof for this historically either.

**A person is not to be blamed for his nature. Rather, he is to be blamed if he acts according to his nature. -Al-Junayd in Hilyat al-Awliya**

Yes, some Muslims lash out at people who have homosexual desires, but that is due to ignorance. Ignorance has always been there.  Our community needs to understand that No One is condemned to Hell simply because they have a desire that is not permissible to engage in.  In fact, all of us have desires that aren't permissible to engage in.

<TEXT>  You would say that there is ultimately one GOD and we as Christians, Jews, Muslims just view that ONE GOD differently?

Yes. And not only the Abrahamic faiths, but other people throughout History, like those who question "Why am i here?", "What is the purpose of my life?" will sometimes recognize that there must exist a higher power, The Creator.  They may not use terms like God, Allah or Yahweh which are known to us.

Sorry, my intention was not to offend, i just wanted to clarify the differences.

 Can I ask what you thought of Reza Aslan's book?

Haven't read it. From what i have heard about him, it looks like he looks at religion from a historical-critical method rather than a more spiritual perspective which can be good sometimes regarding controversial topics.

<TEXT>  The whirling dervishers are simply trying to enter a trance like state to get closer to God. Comparable to Native Americans use of a sweat lodge?

Yes from what i was told, they have different practices in attempts to get closer to God.

 The first time I heard of a Sufi was in the movie Jewel of the Nile. Are they seen as outsiders that are full of life and act like those guys?

I haven't seen the movie.  But Sufi's are sometimes compared to Christian Monks for their amount of devotional practices. Some Sufis are considered heretics for going too far over the top in their worshiping and inventing practices that are more detrimental than helpful. 

 By the way, I teach that today's radical Islamists have in many ways bastardized the religion for political purposes, just as has been done with Christianity in many instances. Sound legit?

Yes, there have definitely been certain segments of Muslims recently who have made political pushes. Sometimes for just reasons (for unity) or sometimes for satanic reasons (personal gain and power). 

Your questions are good, but i can only give brief answers due to my lack of knowledge, if you have any other questions, i would encourage you to ask at [r/islam](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/)

And i don't know about the practices of Native Americans, although i did want to learn very much about their knowledge of the Creator or as they would say: The Great Spirit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, they seem to understand God differently.  Christians view God as a human figure. Muslims reject this and say that God cannot be compared to the creation, but may have been referred to as "the father" but not in a literal sense. Muslims obviously reject trinity and hold that God has no partners similar to Jews. 

Also today, I've noticed that some modern Christians seem more distant with their understanding of God, sometimes saying "god of the Bible".  I found this very strange, and i don't think Christian figures of the past like Thomas Aquinas held this kind of view.

 Yes, i'm a Muslim. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Regarding Jizya taxes; Muslims also pay jizya except it's not called jizya for Muslims, it's called 'Zakah' instead. (Zakah is a religious duty).

Regarding Kafir: it just means disbeliever.

 verses in the both the hadith and al Qur'an all extoll the virtues of genocide and exploitation propagated against religious minorities.

Which verse are you talking about?


 Look at the first page of any Pakistani passport (a casual perusal of Pakistani policies in and of themselves, which come from scripture are on indictment of Islam's treatment of minorities) would reveal that one is only eligible for a passport if they accept the shahadah and then, simultaneously, indict the Ahmadiyyas as nonbelievers.

Your going to die within a few years, as you already know, but perhaps have not truly comprehended that death is inevitable.  All human beings want happiness in this transitory life. This is what we all share.  We all pursue different means to this happiness and seem to come up short too often. 

Fapping, as you know, is very enjoyable, but only momentarily and is never fulfilling. man wants to live eternally, but very soon, without his leave, death arrives and puts an end to his life. He harbours an ocean of desires in his heart, but these desires are never fulfilled. He houses a life of dreams in his mind, but these dreams are never realized. 

What is the purpose of life, alternist? why do you exist?

With a better grasp of reality and understanding the eternal goal, you can break your 15 day mark very easily. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The video doesn't mean that all guys who are friends with girls are going to eventually have sex with them. 

But that eventually in a close guy-girl friend relationship, there is sexual tension from them having a similar relationship as a guy-guy or a girl-girl relationship. 

You may be an abnormal case, since your already have sexual relations with multiple women. 

Think about it. How come the American Army separates men and women?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you think this video is biased: check out the [other videos](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=women+men+friends oq=women+men+friends gs_l=youtube.3...0.0.0.186838.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.0...1ac..11.youtube.) on YouTube about this topic.

Although there are some who say "yes they can be friends".  this appears to be the minority. and the people who have this minority opinion are not always talking about close friends.

And it's harder to come out and say "no they can't be friends", if they already have friends of the opposite gender. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm pretty sure, the video is not talking about friends that you see like once a month, but about day-to-day friends. 

The fact is that men (most men at least) see women very differently then how women see men.

[There will always be some exceptions.] </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not to be rude, but that's pretty much what every lady who has an opposite gender friend thinks at first.  (until they end up being asked out on a date by their "friend" lol).  </TEXT>
